At the end of our three night stay I felt the hotel was average but will probably not stay there again if I return to Montreal because the walls were so thin. I have outlined the good and bad things about the hotel below so that others can make an informed decision. THE GOOD - The hotel's webiste noted that they had changed over all their beds in 2011 and I can't say I had any complaints. The bed was comfortable. - The suite looked clean (save the beginning of mildew in the caulking in a small spot around the tub) - The staff was courteous - The hotel is a short walk (1 block) away from the Berri UQAM metro stop. - Our suite had a kitchenettes that were fully equipped with dishes, dish soap, toaster, coffee maker, stove, fridge, sink, dish cloths etc. (Ideal if you are travelling with people with dietary restrictions or on a tight budget) THE SO SO - Continental Breakfast wasn't very large: bread, a few pastries, half bagels (yes I said half) prewrapped, canned fruit, only plain oatmeal, cornflakes or fruit loops, and prepackaged muffins. - The hotel seemed like it was about two blocks away from a scarier part of town. There was evidence of graffiti in the area. - Parking. We paid $17.25 (taxes included) to park in the garage of the hotel next door only to find out getting in and out of that garage with a larger than average car proved to be quite a challenge. If you drive anything bigger than a Toyota Corolla, Honda civic or Ford Focus I wouldn't advise it. -The price- While it was not bad for the area, I have paid less to stay in nicer places. - The size of the bed- I don't tknow if they were using a different sizing chart but that \"queen sized\" bed looked very much like a double to me. THE BAD -The Walls are paper thin. I could clearly hear the conversations of the poeple in the room next to mine. I had a hard time sleeping because of late night and early morning converations, and loud music coming from the room next to mine in the three nights I was there. - The fridge was old and noisy. When other guests weren't keeping me awake the fridge in our suite took over. - The fold out bed-There were three of us traveling so each of us slept on the fold out couch one night. While the actual bed was comfortable the fold out was a recipe for tossing, turning and a cricked neck. I wouldn't recommend anyone sleep on it. Overall, I think I would have had a better impression this hotel had I been able to get a good nights sleep instead of hearing my neighbours conversations all night long.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wilmington, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel - good location\u201d", "Author": "Tanya_Gabe", "ReviewID": "UR124898495", "Content": "Overall, our stay at Le Roberval for our conference in Montreal was just fine. We got a great deal on Expedia, and it was well worth it. The hotel is located very close to the subway station and the bus station, so it is easy to get to lots of Montreal sites and is also easy to take the 737 bus to/from the airport. The hotel is also located close to lots of restaurants (Rue St.-Denis), and if you are up for walking, you can walk to lots of other places in the city (or take the subway if you aren't). Our room was clean. It had two small closets, a refrigerator, hair dryer, flat screen TV. No dresser though, so we couldn't really put our clothes away. We were given an iron/ironing board when we asked for one. The hotel is on a relatively busy street, so I was afraid it would be noisy at night. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't hear too much traffic. But the hotel walls are pretty thin, and the pipes are loud, so we did hear some indoor noise. The breakfast was not too exciting (2 kinds of cereal, yogurt, croissants, toast, bagels, muffins, canned fruit, juice, coffee, tea), but it was free, and had enough food to tide us over until lunchtime. The options never changed though, by our 4th morning, we were wanting more variety. The staff was polite. The internet was fast and free. The room temperature was comfortable.

Before booking I wrote to the hotel to inquire about parking space/size. They were kind enough to advise that our car would not fit in their parking lot but there was a surface lot just down the block we could use. When we arrived the young man at reception was very friendly and gave us great advise on where to find a 'real beer' bar in the area and did not mind speaking English (when needed). I liked that we were near the IGA store so we could stock up on a few things like wine, cheese, bread, pate, fruit, etc. and use the in-room fridge to avoid the cost of some meals in restaurants. One thing we were not thrilled with, but had no problems with, was the park next to the metro entrance was filled with many young street people loiterring around and they were doing a large feeding of homeless people each evening. Watch your pockets and valuables and it was fine. The room was large, two queen beds, but the lighting was poor. Need more down lighting for reading by the beds and stronger watt bulbs wouldn't hurt. The rooms were clean, shower worked well and the lighting in the bathroom was good for shaving and make-up application. Windows were well insulated and kept most of the city noise out. The heat in the room kept going up even though we kept trying to lower it. The heating was quite and the seperate heater and thermostat in the bathroom was nice to have. We were going to call about the heat but decided not to since we were in bed and didn't want someone coming to the room when we were in our pj's. I'm sure they would have dealt with it efficiently since they handled all other enquiries well (the staff were friendly and helpful with all the clientelle that I saw while waiting in the lobby). The free WiFi and desk in the room made it easy to use the computer to check local attractions, etc. It was nice to have an elevator but it could be a bit poky when people were going down to the breakfast room. The free breakast was simple and adequate, nothing special to write about. Big bonus for me was the little luggage cart that I could take outside to load/unload the car and it fit in the narrow hallways and elevator without a struggle. The walk to the Latin Quarter, Chinatown and Vieux Montreal was easy from this hotel and the metro with great connections was just minutes away. If you want the nicer shopping on Rue St. Catherine, you need to take the metro to McGill or Peel stops, which are about 4 stops away from the station near the hotel. We did have some confusion with purchasing a metro ticket but the majority of the staff were very helpful and willing to speak English. We did enjoy the shops in the area of the hotel that sold books and magazines (which we came to Montreal to buy) so we didn't have to carry them far.

The breakfast was very adequate and the area was clean and was kept restocked by a very nice staff person. The parking was the only big negative. It's expensive and across the street in a garage with a really sharp curve going down into it and it was steep too.

The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, capable of quick service in either French or English. The room was clean, bright and warm.

Was a little worried after reading some of the reviews but decided to give it a chance. Got there much earlier than we could get into our room, but were checked in and given access to the parking garage ($15/day). The parking garage is behind the hotel across the street - there are a few spots in front of the hotel for you to load and unload. The parking garage is very tight - if you're driving anything bigger than a small SUV you might be in trouble. While we waited we walked down to Old Montreal - only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. The front desk staff were very helpful, took the time to show us everywhere we wanted to go on a map. The room wasn't bad at all - a little old but more like a small apartment than a hotel room. Very clean as well. Had no toiletries in the bathroom but went to the front desk and were given them immediately. Shower is more like a water cannon, but at least the water was hot, and it's better than having no pressure. The kitchen has dishes for you to use - there is a sign posted informing you of a $25-$30 charge if you don't wash them yourself. Air conditioner is in the \"living room\" with the TV (only 2 English channels) and a pull-out. It is very loud, but turning it off or shutting the door was not an option as it was pretty hot that day. Bedroom has no TV in it. Bed is pretty hard, not very comfortable at all unfortunately. We were on the corner of the hotel at a pretty busy intersection, so there is traffic noise as well as a hospital close by. That didn't bother us too much, the bigger problem is that the inside hotel walls are pretty thin, and there were other guests who thought nothing of screaming in the hallways at 3 in the morning. There is wireless internet in the rooms, they give you the password at the front desk. Seemed to work pretty well. Continental breakfast included as well, same as you would expect. Toast, cereal, bagels (Montreal has the best bagels!), fruit, yogurt, coffee and tea. All in all, a pretty good hotel. Couldn't beat the price.

Because we want to feel the real atmosphere of Montreal, we decided to stay at a hotel in Downtown area, and unfortunately we chose Le Roberval which turned out later to be a very bad decision. And here are some of the reasons.. 1. It is REALLY noisy!! I am usually not picky of the quietness of hotels but this hotel is beyond any tolerance of mine. It is noisy all night. I was waken up many times during the night due to the traffic outside. I closed all windows tight, but it's just useless. 2. Unsatisfied service: When checking in, we told the clerk that we would like a QUIET room, so we preferred rooms in higher levels. When we pulled our luggage to the 5th floor ( by the way, the highest floor is 6th floor), we found our room was facing a major road, and actually, the room was located at the corner of the intersection of two busy roads! The room's very noisy day and night. :-( 3. Over-charging: when we checked out, the bill charged us $60 for two nights parking (before taxes), and the price should be $15 per night. The clerk refunded us after we found out this issue, but he didn't show any apologies at all. Even $15 per night is quite expensive, since the parking is in a different location and you have to pull your luggage cross the street to the hotel. The parking site is quite small, you'd better to be a good driver to park there. 4. The rooms and the building have some stale smell, everything in our room is quite old. TV is not working ( yes, you can turn it on, but the image is as blur as the most strange paintings in the art gallery in downtown. The screen of the TV is very tiny too, I have not seen a TV which looks that shabby for more than 20 years!) There is no shampoo. And it even charges you $25 if you use the dishes and don't wash it yourself! The only thing decent in this hotel is the breakfast. The food is not bad, and there are many choices of food.

The bathroom was pathetically small, the curtain leaked, and I can't quite compose myself to describe what the place smelled like. 4) Do not repeat our mistake and fall for the advertising that mentions a garage.

This hotel does not have the \"typical tacky decor\" seen in most cheaper hotels ... the bedroom had an exposed brick wall and a wrought iron bedframe; very \"european\" look to it. The staff were very friendly, the free breakfast was basic, but good. Another big plus about this hotel is that it is downtown; a very short walk to the nightlife/clubs/bars/restaurants. I would definitely return to this hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto ONtario", "Title": "\u201cClean, Priced Right, Close To Everything\u201d", "Author": "TravelTorontoONtario", "ReviewID": "UR26894944", "Content": "After a lengthy search to find a CLEAN, place to stay for the weekend I decided on the Roberval, being from Montreal I wanted a central place to stay close to the Metro but foremost CLEAN, The Roberval did not disappoint me. We had 2 quad rooms, there were 8 of us, going to see the Habs play Toronto. Both rooms had 2 double beds, your typical TV, bathroom, chair. writing table, and an additional sink with limited cutlery. Which was fine I did not plan on cooking, I noticed they had had outlets for a stove in both rooms but both stoves had been taken out. The hotel is now dedicated to Non smoking, on every floor. The parking is $15.00 per night but is in a secured underground parking area. The breakfast was included each morning from 7-10 for all occupants, it was bagels yogurt toast cereal coffee tea orange juice. Not bacon and eggs but enough to keep you happy and on your way. The hotel is walking distance to St. Catherines as well as many attractions. The casino (I would take my vehicle there is about 15 minutes away, the front desk will give you a map to get you there if you ask). The metro which is an excellent underground subway system is in walking distance from the hotel.. We got a day pass unlimited for $9.00 each. We took the Metro to the Bell Centre, we preferred to just keep our car in the hotel parking since it can be a bit dicy getting a parking spot in Montreal, and we would just have to pay for additional parking anyway. The cost for each room was $125.00 plus tax. Compared to other hotels I had had my friends (who still reside in Montreal check out) this was by far the best. Something I should add is I hate the way usual hotel rooms have carpeting everywhere and who knows what has been on it. At the Roberval a good portion of it was tiling which is good especially if you have allergies. The limited carpeting that was on the floor was immaculate. I know other reviews have said that it was not quite what they expected and I can see by the pictures on the web site it had to have been prior to the renovation which was going on in the small lobby when we arrived. But if you want a CLEAN, well located hotel and don't want to pay $200.00 per night for a bed to sleep in this should be your pick. When we first approached the entrance it almost looked like an apartment and the lobby is a bit on the small side, but we were not there to hang around a lobby nor were we there to sit in a hotel bar (which they do not have), we were there to sleep and go out and enjoy the night life of Montreal. I hope your stay is as pleasant as our was, we could not have asked for anything better. I have told my friends in Toronto about this hotel and will be making this hotel my place to stay anytime I am in Montreal again.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "jk", "Title": "\u201cNever stay there, they are cheats and liers\u201d", "Author": "hello123Jk", "ReviewID": "UR26817032", "Content": "I booked the hotel for a 3 night stay through Hotels.com over the phone and asked specifically that time to the agent while booking if the parking was included because parking is ridiculously priced in Montreal and can be very expensive. I was specifically told multiple times by the representative that it is included with the cost of renting the rooms and Iwould not be charged anything extra for it. I was told multiple times since I asked multiple times specifically about the parking charges. Anyways when I went to Montreal to rent the room, I was told my Mr, Samuel who was sitting on the front desk that night, that the parking charges were not included in my hotel stay and I would have to pay extra for it; when I explained to him that I was told so specifically by the booking agent that the parking is included in the cost of renting the room, this guy agreed to it and told me it's not a problem and he would put that in the contract and I wouldn't have to pay any extra for it. Total lie! When I was checking out at the end of my 3 night stay there the front desk person tells me that I owe them $51 extra for the parking charges in additon to the room charges that were already paid and they would charge my credit card for that. When I interrupted her and told that I was assured during my check in by the front desk person that the parking charges will not be charged extra she says she is not aware of any such thing and they are entitled to being paid for the parking charges. When I asked to be spoken to with the person who checked me in she tell me that he is not here now. After much deliberation and wait I was made to talk to a supervisior on the phone who kept repeating the same thing. When I asked to speak to her in person she maid me wait > 30 min in the lobby and when she did come she said the same statement as she uttered over the phone. When I asked her to speak to htis Samuel guy for clarifying the matter myself, she said she would tak to him herself when he comes back to work that night. when I asked her to call me about the results of her discussion with her later that day she said she would and she even took down by number. She also said she would not charge my credit card till she speaks t o this guy. Anyways, the outome of the matter, she never called me back,though I expected at least a courtesy call from her and after a month of my stay there, I see my credit card being charged for their exorbitant parking charges. The name of their supervisor was Viviane. I advise anyone going to Montreal to be aware of this parking scam where they make try desperately to make more money; And if you have to pay for it, you can use other open garages that are much cheaper and/or stay in a better hotel that would charge for the parking but at least would have better services.

I stayed here with 5 friends at the end of August of 2008. We loved the idea of the family suites where we could all stay in the same unit together. We should have went with two rooms at a Best Western. When we go there we were immediately a little disappointed.. the room was very dim and not as large as advertised. Only one bathroom as well. The floor was cold and the bathroom didn't steamed up very quickly. Since we thought we were getting a good deal we let that slide. The next day we realized that staff didn't come and clean the rooms, once again we let that slide. We asked for more towels, none came. Let that one slide too. We were in Montreal having a good time and didn't want the hotel to ruin it. We checked out at the end of our trip and thought that would be the end of it. About a week after we left my credit card was charged for an extra 141 dollars. After calling the hotel I was informed that this was for: a) a 25 dollar charge for leaving dishes in the sink b) a 100 dollar charge for a leak in the bathroom. Now, if you were paying 800 dollars for three nights at a hotel room, would you not expect that if you left a few cups in the sink that would be alright? We saw no documentation of this charge. As for the leak in the bathroom, we had been having troubles with our toliet for the entire stay and had mentioned this to them on check out, but alas, that doesn't matter apparently. When I called them they repeatedly denied that we told them about the leak or that there was no documentation of the dish rule present in the rooms. I've found their staff very difficult to deal with and would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Spring for one of the other hotel's in the area.

Kitchen was Ok - gas oven, fridge, no dirty plates or pots as others wrote (even though we brought our own little pot - just in case).

The staff were helpful and friendly. We booked our hotel in Montreal this time based on price and location (we were heading to the Jacques Villeneuve circuit the next day) and kept in mind that it was only going to be used for one night to lay our heads. This was a good choice for that. It is in the vicinity of the University of Quebec, and must have been residences during the school year or something because each room was a mini-suite that came with a separate bedroom and bathroom from the kitchen and living room area. We ended up having to switch rooms 3 times because the first room had no working air conditioning and the second room had the same plus there was work being done to the stove and kitchen area (they should have really check on this room before we tried it). Once we got settled into our third room, it was deemed satisfactory, a working airconditioner, appliances and clean bathroom. The TV remote needed a change in batteries but then again we were not spending lots of time there. Outside the building was a little shady in that the buildings around it were a little dilapitated and when you walked up to St. Catherine street, there were quite a few homeless people close by. But being at the corner of Beri St and Rene Levesque we were very close to shopping on St Catherine St, St Denis St. and St Laurent where there are many great cafes and restaurants to choose from. One restaurant on St Catherine we enjoyed was called De Giovanni's where they served awesome pasta. They must make it fresh daily, and you should see the meatballs!! Here is a review: http://restomontreal.ca/restaurants/index.php?section=viewresto&resto_id=601&show=ratings&lang=en We only paid $92 for the night and got a huge continental breakfast included with the price in the basement floor of their building in a little cafe restaurant. Served was juice and coffee, hot/cold cereal, yogurt, real Montreal bagels with jam or cream cheese, toast, fruit salad muffins. A real tasty treat first thing in the morning!
