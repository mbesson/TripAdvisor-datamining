Don't get me wrong you get what you pay for, but the room was clean, the staff were very accommodating and friendly (I arrived at the hotel a few hours before my girlfriend who made the reservation and they allowed me to check in without her). This hotel could definitely use some upgrades. Our balcony door wouldn't shut, balcony was a little questionable, and the elevators are pretty grubby, and if your over the age of 30 I'd suggest staying somewhere a little quieter, but you won't find anything better for your money.

It's not very expensive and you're in the middle of Downtown Montreal, walking distance to the Bell Centre and shopping on Ste-Catherine's Street. And if you want to go out to a bar, the only problem is trying to pick one, there are so many in the immediate surroundings. The rooms are clean and modern. They're original and somewhat fancy. Good Fen-Shui, I told my hubby. We picked one, twice, with a King size bed. There was a sofa, flat screen TV, fridge and coffeemaker. We asked the maid for packages of real coffee, not the non-decafinated kind, and she was gracious enough to give us what we asked for, plus real cups of milk instead of coffeemate. Local phone calls are free and internet also even though there is a weird kind of timer that starts when you use it. We choose the 14th floor because of the view of beautiful Downtown Montreal since there are balconies for every room. The last time we went there, we were facing Crescent Street, and we were happy to be on the 14th floor because the sounds coming from the people below on the street after last call must have been really bothersome for someone staying on lower floors. We were lucky that no one on our floor partied past 11 pm. But we could hear, on the balconies lower, that some people were there to party all night. Glad they weren't on our floor. The only thing I did not like was, when we were leaving, there was blood on the elevator door. When I told the reception, she told me that someone had cut themselves as if I was curious to find out what had happened. I just wanted them to clean it up before other guests saw that. Pretty gross!

I have no clue why it matters when we check in as we had already paid but nonetheless that was nothing compared to what was to come. The rooms were clean and had a 32 inch flat screen LG tv. The remote however did not work and when we told front desk about the problem they claimed they had no batteries. We just stayed the first night inside our hotel drinking a couple of beers. The next night everything was fine. We had no issue with the hotel. Then on our last night of stay at the hotel which was a Friday night. We noticed that there was a strange looking dude standing outside our room with a black toque on. He looked rather intoxicated and we thought he was with the people next door which later turned out not to be true. He told us he was looking for a guy named John and when we told him there was no John in this room he just smiled. About 10mins later as we were leaving to go to the bar he was still outside our room which was definitely a little sketched but again we thought he was with our neighbours as we had seen him talking to them earlier. We left at 11:30pm, and came back early at 1:30am as one of my bud wanted to get money to go to the casino. We found out that our room had been robbed. I lost my laptop along with my DNG Prescription glasses which I had paid over 300$ for! My friend lost his old itouch along with 200$ cash as he had foolishly left his money on the table. The laptop was about 2 years old and probably worth around 400$ but it was not the fact that I lost the laptop but the fact that I had important information in there. Before leaving our room we had nothing to drink and chose to rather drink that night out at the bar making us all sober when we left the room. We had made sure we locked the front door when we left as we had a weird gut feeling about the sketchy individual. We also locked our back balcony door as it is rather easy to hop from one balcony to the other (like a half metre apart). We immediately informed the front desk about what had happened, and he told us that there was no reason to call the police and that the next morning the manager will be in at 10am sharp, and we may be able to get the video footage of who got into our room and go from there. Foolishly we agreed to that and the next morning me and my friend went at 10am sharp to speak to the \"manager\". When we went there was someone new working and he told us that the manager will not be in till monday! But our check out date was Saturday morning. The man in the front desk the day earlier had lied to us about the manager coming in for Saturday. I then quickly called the Montreal Police who said they will come asap. They came within 10mins but we did not know as the receptionist had told the police that we were staying in a different room. The police had knocked on an empty room to file the report and just as the police got into his car I had asked him if he had come to the hotel regarding a robbery. He said yes and asked why we had not opened our room! I could not believe that the front desk man had lied to the police about our room number so we do not file a police report. But then again the front desk guy may have just made a \"mistake\". So at the end of all this I finally submitted a police report regarding the robbery and the police informed us that they will check the camera Monday when the manager is back and give me a call when I am back in Toronto. And as if things were not bad enough they got worse. We had prepaid a $50 deposit when we first came to the hotel in the case that we damage anything. We used a prepaid MasterCard to pay. As we were leaving the front desk man took the prepaid card and stated that he had reimbursed our deposit. He gave us a receipt with it and told us that card balance is back to $50. We did not check the receipt and when we went to pump some gas with the money the balance cashier stated the card balance was 0. We called MasterCard to double check the balance and indeed it was 0. This hotel is owned by what I believe thieves. We even have a doubt that we may have been set up by the hotel staff for the robbery. However, I hate to make accusations but all the evidence makes this hotel look bad! I am probably never going to receive any of my goods back and our report will probably end up in the recycling bin. The only good about this hotel was its location and that it was clean (just the rooms and lobby) Apart from that , stay away from this hotel! ps.

We chose to go to Starbucks instead at the other end of the street. The hotel was quite reasonably priced ($99 plus tax)so not sure really if we could have done better. We're not really sure whether we would choose to stay there again. On positive point was that the 747 bus from the airport stopped at the end of the road which cost $8 each.

That's about where the upside for this place ends. See all that convenient parking at the sides and behind the hotel?

Now to the next lie...See that pretty little pizza place in the lobby? Well, it was never actually open...morning, noon, or night. And hey, look closely at the menu board above the counter. Yes, there are pieces of paper covering the boards showing all the different pizzas this place makes saying \"This is not a pizzeria\". Hilarious! Not only is it not a pizzeria, its not ANYTHING. Even if it were open, the six or eight people that could be seated in this closet of a restaurant would have to be kicked out after ten minutes to make room for the next customers.

I have stayed at various hotels in the downtown area, ranging from the Marriott to the Travelodge. This hotel is now in my top three. A friend recommended this hotel to me. I booked through the hotel website for the third weekend in October. They have a free loyalty club through the hotel's website that offers discounted stay based upon the number of days until your stay. I booked a room (with a 7-day advanced planning discount) for US $98 (plus QC taxes) that had two queen size beds and a queen size pull-out sofa. The room was nicely furnished with dark wood furniture and very soft carpeting. The beds were very comfortable (medium-hard with a pillow-top) and the bathroom exceeded expectations, complete with hair dryer, massage-type shower head (no tub - just a stall), plenty of towels and the standard amenities. We always had hot-water on demand and the water pressure was strong. There was a 27\" flat-screen tv in the room that had a good mix of English and French speaking channels. There was also a single-cup coffee-maker and a leather office-style chair at the desk. There was bottled-water available for $3 for the 1 liter. I bought a 2-liter bottled water at the convenience store across the street for the same price. Our room was on the second floor and did not have a balcony. Looking out our window, we could see all of the Crescent St bars. We could barely hear the noise from them, but this could have been the air conditioner drowning out the sound. Parking was $20 per 24 hours and the lot was directly next to the hotel. This lot provided us in/out access and no tipping was necessary. Checking in was a breeze. Upon check-in, they gave us the password to access the free wifi. My friend used the wifi with his smartphone and he seemed satisfied with it. The front desk always had smiling employees and they were very helpful about providing directions and even a plunger, on request. Checking out was also very easy, but they did not offer express check-out like you so often find in the US. The hotel does not have a pool or a fitness center. There were no vending machines at the hotel and the ice machine was near the lobby. There was a computer in the front desk area that we used to check times for movie listings. They could make this computer area a bit more private and definitely more comfortable. The computer is at waist height, facing everyone, and there is no chair available for it. The location is great if visiting the Bell Centre or the downtown area is where you want to be. It's a block to Starbucks, St. Catherine's St, and plenty of shopping.

I book one room through Expedia using it's Unpublished Rates (if you don't know what that is, go check it out since it's totally worth it). As I titled this review, it's necessary to highlight the good location of this hotel. You will be on Crescent St between the commercial St-Catherine (the best part of the street) and Rene Levesque. So you can access everywhere walking: the shopping area, the financial area, the beautiful Mont Royal (from which you can have probably the best view of the town), and also the Vieux-Montreal and Vieux-Port. However, this central location has one drawback: noise. Specially on weekends (plus a holiday!) the nice bars and restaurants with terraces are super crowded and you will hear the noise from you room. This might or might not be an inconvenience for you... if you walked all day long, be sure you will fall asleep as soon as you touch the pillow. The hotel seems to have been refurbished very recently. The room had all brand new furniture, with those excellent, hard-to-get-up-in-the-morning Simmons Beautyrest, a modern LCD TV with broad choice of cable channels, a desk with comfortable chair, and fine lamps with plugs on them. The bathroom was acceptable, nice big bath with shower, a big counter with space to put your toiletries, and a wall-sized mirror. All the rooms have balcony and a good heating / air conditioning system. Our fare included 'breakfast'. They given you a coupon to go to the bar in the corner to have a coffee and a baguette. Judge by yourself. (us we've only been once) My 'poor Quality \"in\"' statement is related to some issues we experience during the stay: - Noise: as I said before, it was quite bothering the first night (we had just checked in); it might have been the fact that we were on the 8th floor and the noise goes up (?); - Not-locking door!: we realized that the door of the room was not locking automatically; one night when we came back from the restaurant, I pushed the door and could open it without using the card! (this happened a second time after the room cleaning was made). We were quite bothered by this, since we were leaving all our belongings in the room during the day; at the front desk they told us it was because of the paint they used in the recent refurbish. Conclusion, you need to slam the door to make sure it's closed and locked. - Room key: they are cards as everywhere nowadays, but twice they were not working and we had to go get them re-done: in both times, they just gave us a new cards with even asking us any prove that we were the occupants of the room. This might have something to do with the door problem. - Cleaning: first day, the cleaning was very good we met the maid and she was very nice. After that, the room was not deeply clean anymore (though I guess fair enough). Last day, the woman left us a message saying that \"because of the weekend + holiday\" she couldn't leave us more towels (we were 3). We had to go ask for towels downstairs. Also the amenities, like shampoo and conditions, were not enough. - Free Internet: dreadful. Very slow. You can try using another free network you can catch. - Staff: some of them were very nice, some others seemed bothered to be asked about something. I guess this is normal in a 2-star hotel. Conclusion: It might not we the best hotel in town (surely not, there are amazing hotel in Montreal), it's a 2 star, with cheap fares, you cannot really ask much out of it.

Most surprisingly, there were bugs on my bed and in the pillow covers. As mentioned earlier there was a unique misty smell in the room throughout. The breakfast was the most disappointing as it did not have any option. There were hardly 4-5 items and they were also served very late in the morning. For a business traveler it is important that the breakfast be done by 7-7.30 am. However, when we entered the breakfast room we observed that they were only setting it up. There were only limited items like freezed boiled eggs, bread, coffee and fruits. thats it. The parking space was also lacking as once or twice we had to find parking space outside the hotel premises. Reception staff was courteous and helpful. The hotel had a few nice places at walking distance thus food and shopping was not a problem. Overall, I would rate the hotel as very average and not much value for money. They can do much better if they can take care of the cleanliness of the hotel.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cif u dont get your room really for pennies go somewhere else\u201d", "Author": "charles750", "ReviewID": "UR71433500", "Content": "i was in for grand prix week thou it was good location for night life but the service was terrible maybe they were overbooked and the smell of the food in the hotel all day long makes you hungry so if you are on a diet not recommended the breakfast was a bagel and a coffee that taste terrible anyway the only good i could find was the location if you dont want to sleep", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alapaha, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Mediocre Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jgaskins43", "ReviewID": "UR67895653", "Content": "A friend and I stayed at the Quality Inn Montreal for the Candadian Grand Prix.

My friends and I are 23 year old European girls from Toronto who enjoy shopping, sight seeing and a vibrant nightlife with great house music and fair prices. We are not high maintenance but want a place thats clean, safe and has a friendly, helpful staff! (I don't think that's too much to ask!). The pros of the hotel are as follows: -Amazing location: a one minute walk to St. Catherine St, the best place to shop, full of boutiques and the underground city (a bunch of malls connected to each other underground). The downside, there is a strip club almost directly in front of the hotel and a dirty alley way right beside the hotel. -Some of the staff is friendly, greeted us with a smile, gave us some helpful tips on where to shop, eat etc - The noise issue people complained about was not our experience, it was pretty quiet so don't worry about that. Just make sure you get a room that faces the back of the hotel. -This hotel does hold onto your bags even after you've checked out. We had a late flight and i didn't want to carry all of our luggage around so they held onto them free of charge. -This hotel has a shuttle that will take you from central station to the hotel free of charge, however you have to pay to take the bus from the airport to central station which is $24 there and back which they don't tell you about on the website and is a bit confusing when you arrive in Montreal for the first time and don't know where to go! and that's it! Now here are the cons, bare with me there are many!! -Our initial room was disgusting! It smelled terrible, was dirty and the worst thing was that the sheets were stained with something that resembled blood. I am not joking this is the truth!. We called front desk to complain and they moved us to another room, the room right next door! The appropriate thing to do was to upgrade us for the trouble, we already were paying $120 per night Canadian to stay in this place, the least they could do was offer us a better space. -The room we stayed in appeared better in the beginning. The sheets were clean. But upon inspection, the bottom of the shower curtain had black muck on the bottom of it, the wallpaper was peeling in the washroom and so was the paint on the ceiling above the shower! The windows were dirty, the hinges to the door that leads to the balcony was rusted and the railing of the balcony looked like it was about 200 years old. The couch had white stains on it and the carpet was grimy to say the least. DON'T walk bare foot on the carpet or in the bathroom! Even the carpet in the elevator had stains on it like someone got sick on it the night before and stained it! -As we headed out to check out the nightlife we asked the front desk what time we had to be up in the morning so our room could be cleaned. They told us anytime before 2pm. So the next morning we were out of our room by noon. We crossed paths with the cleaning crew on our floor as we were leaving. They asked us if we needed service and we did and they said they would take care of our room for us. When we got back to our room at around 7pm our room had NOT been cleaned! Our dirty towels were still in a pile in the tube as was asked so that the cleaning crew would know to change them, the garbages were not replaced, our old bed linens were still on the bed, nothing was done! We could not believe this!!! We called front desk and they told us that they would see what they could do. 15 minutes later a guy showed up with 2 fresh towels! That's it, 2 towels! can you believe it! we had to call front desk again and ask for more towels. We did receive more but that should not have been the end of our service. We needed more toilet paper, garbages had to be emptied, the shower needed to be cleaned and we needed new bed linens. We did receive new bed linens with the second round of towels that we had to put on our bed ourselves. I did not know that when you pay $120 per night, for a total of two nights that we would have to make our own bed! This is suppose to be our vacation. A vacation in Canada, a first world country that I would assume world have higher standards and better service. I have been to resorts in third world countries and received first class service all the way by EVERYONE at the resort! This was embarrassing! -That night we went out to party and when we came back we decided to get some pizza from the shop that was attached to the hotel. However the door that attached the pizza place to the hotel was locked! At first we were angry because we would then have to walk outside to get in to the establishment but then were happy because we noticed that the people inside ordering pizza were sketchy to say the least and we felt it would be unsafe if the door attaching to two establishments would have been open. We went back to our room and called front desk to see if we could get food delivered but no one answered the phone! I though front desk was suppose to be there at all times to assist us! We called back 4 times in 45 minutes and no one answered. How about if there was an emergency? Needless to say we went to bed hungry that night! -The next day we checked out to come back home and we were charged $3.50 for the bottle of water that we drank in our room that we figured was complimentary because it was just a regular bottle of water on the coffee table when we arrived. Usually items that are charged are in a mini bar or have notes on them saying that you must pay to consume! -During our stay we noticed many of the visitors were young guys here in Montreal to party, who probably don't care about a clean room and that just want shelter to sleep. So that is who I recommend this hotel for. If you don't care about dirt or an unfriendly, non-helpful staff and put location on the top of your priority list then reserve this hotel but I think most people could do better.

A couple \"negatives\", although nothing really major. There was a festival going on on Crescent that night/day and the street was closed to vehicles. It took us an extra few minutes to try and find the parking area for the hotel due to it. Parking was $18 (ugh), but this was to be expected- it isthe city afterall. You can take your car in/out anytime which is a plus if you choose to do so. Another plus is that it nearby to the Bell Centre, which is just down the street on Rene Levesque.

They had been full the night before but they had a housekeeper work on a room that had just checked out and I was in my room in less than one hour. This after enjoying a nice breakfast in the hotels intimate and amazingly inexpensive restaurant. The food was good but I finally found a place in Montreal where you can find bad coffee. The room itself was quite spacious and immaculately clean. High speed internet is CA$9.95 per stay. There are many CATV channels as well as pay per view. The real joy of the rooms here are the walkout balconies with nice views of downtown and the soundproofing is very good. The hotel hallways were looking a bit shabby mainly because they had installed new door frames on the stairwell doors, but for some reason hadn't painted them. Oh, and watch your step when going into or out of the bathroom ! On the night before my check out I called for a wake up call at 1030 am to accomodate their 12n checkout policy.

Frustrated, I called the Canadian Comfort Inn/Suites number and complained about the obvious, and added the loud rattle in the A/C and the TV that had to be unplugged to power off. Soon a man arrived, swearing heavily in English, but with a French accent. Apparently, he was the only facilities guy working that night and there were multiple complaints that evening. He explains that he can't do anything about the music, he decided to unclog the bath, but with no running water, it brought a strong raw sewage stench into the room! Then he unplugs the TV to turn it off, then kicks the A/C a couple times to stop the rattle (which quickly returned). Remember, we had just driven 12 hours, and we got no sleep until 3am. If we got 3 hours of sleep, we were lucky. We did manage to take showers in the morning. The Hotel had a 100% satisfaction guarantee or your room is free. The manager would only subtract half, explaining that they did the best that they could do.

We had booked three rooms at the Crescent Street location. The cost of each room was $186.29 for the night. I researched the hotel on the internet and the description and pictures looked very nice. At that price I also figured the rooms would be more than adequate. They were anything but. When we arrived at our room (#401) there were numerous stains (some still wet!) on the carpet, and on the bed sheets. The lamp shades were even stained ! The bathroom was also disgusting. The rubber lining on the bottom of the tub was not entirely sealed and when you showered, there was a distinct smell of rotting water and whatever else laid beneath the tile. Most people did not even shower because of the stench. We might as well bathed in the St. Lawrence Seaway ! The description also spoke of a \"partial room divider\" in the so-called \"suites\". The divider was basically a three feet high by two foot rotting piece of wood jutting out from the wall. There was also a pull-out couch in the room. When we pulled it out there was a dirty ladies undergarment within the bed. The room was utterly disgusting, by far the worst any of us had ever stayed in. I sent a couple of complaint letters but have only been told they were looking into it. I have not heard anything within the past two months. I suggest management go view the room themselves & see if they would consider paying $186.29 to stay there. It is not worth 29 cents and we will never stay there again.
