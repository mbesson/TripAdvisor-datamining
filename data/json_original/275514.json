DO NOT book the \"family room\" at the Jubilee Hotel under any circumstance - well maybe it's a step up from sleeping on the steps of one of the nearby churches, but other than that there is just about anything better. I am not a germaphobe by any means, but this hotel was gross. The bathroom was moldy and filthy - reminded me more of Mexico than London. I didn't even brush my teeth in there - used a glass and bottled water instead! Stayed out as late as possible and left first thing in the morning. Found a cuter, cleaner place in a better location just a few streets west in Belgravia - no more expensive either. What a dump! Also the man on the phone hardly spoke English and couldn't give us walking directions from Victoria Station so we wandered quite a while in the cold looking for the place. Not run by locals and they weren't friendly at all. Breakfast was minimal - cold cereal, tea and toast. And they do want you to leave your key everytime you leave.

The three rooms that share a bathroom are in the basement of the renovated townhouse.

There were two beds, a double and a single, neither of which had sheets large enough to fit the bed. My husband and I attempted to sleep on the double bed, but the matress was so dis-shaped I felt like I was upside-down and my husband could only be tilted into the center of the mattress, thus I spent my night in the single bed. There is a window with a few to nowhere, well technically its a wall, and no curtains either, and wonderful at night when the light that is lighing the sign for the hotel shines right into the room too! :(The bathroom can only be descirbed as deplorable. There was mold (green and black) growning on almost every surface except the sink and the toilet. The staff were friendly enough. The street noise is loud. The location is great as it is a half-hour walk to Westminster abbey and a 5 min walk from Victoria station.

The bathroom was clean and there was hot water every time we showered. Breakfast was included, but we decided to eat elsewhere.

Basically, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bare boned B&B in the classic London tradition. I stayed here for three nights from 18 July, 2011onward. My en-suite room was very basic, but reasonably clean. You can get a cheaper room with shared bath, but after having stuck my head into the shared bathroom on one floor, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend that route, unless you economically absolutely have to. The building has no lifts, so keep that in mind. If you end up on the 5th floor, like I was, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be huffing and puffing getting your things up and down. They do serve breakfast, but I did not sample it during my stay, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on it. There is wireless, at a reasonable cost, with a strong signal, so no weak drop-out problems, as is often the case with budget places. The best thing about this place is the Location, which is about 3-4 min\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s walk from Victoria Station. The other positive is the price. London is a hotel city, but the days of getting dirt cheap places are long over. Even \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbudget\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 places are pricey. Jubilee, and places in that immediate area, (Hugh St, Belgrave Rd, etc), is still your best bet for affordable accommodations. I was here only for a few days exclusively to check out West End theatre (see my review on one of them; Wicked), the London Museum, and some shopping at Harrods, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend a lot of time in the room. Will I stay here again? Likely not, as this was kind of a sentimental stay reliving some old memories, but if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a cheap place that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasonably clean, then go for it. Overall I think it is one of the better B&B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in that area, but you do get what you pay for. You also might want to try Comfort Inn, which a few seconds walk away, if you want this area but with more modern facilities. Cost will be about 50% more than Jubilee.

For us that was no problem, just a bit of extra exercise. Breakfast was as you could expect, no abundance but rather acceptable. The location next to Victoria coach station was just perfect for us as our flight from London was very early in the morning and we were able to walk to the bus stop in just a few minutes. I have stayed in several hotels and hostels and there has been some much worse than the Jubilee.

I had the opportunity to speak with him on a call-in radio show prior to leaving & I told him I was risking my marital bliss based on his guidebook. I ended up having to move my reservation by two weeks, which the hotel handled without a problem. Upon arrival, the hotel had a plumbing issue in one of the rooms, so my wife and I spent our first night in room 35. It was so small that the bed could only be exited on one side - all three other sides abutted a wall. The shower was approximately 2' x 2' x 6'6\". There was a hand-held shower head, but I still found it nearly impossible to wash thoroughly. The bed, supposedly a double, was really more like a twin-&-a-half. The room was clean (other than a cigarette burn in the bedspread), but it was really so small as to be laughable. I've stayed at the Upper West Side YMCA in NYC; this room was smaller. I'm sure they don't normally put two people in this room (especially two fat Americans!) because there was only one towel in the room. Breakfast was toast, cereal, yogurt, juice & coffee. Not great, but adequate and served with a smile. As we were leaving for the day, the manager let us know that they'd be moving us to another room. We told him that our junk was kinda unpacked, but he told us they'd be happy to organize our stuff & move it for us. We were hesitant, but we agreed. Upon our return, we found our bags had been repacked with care & transplanted to room G1 on the ground floor. The room was such a vast improvement that we nearly cried. It was still small by American standards, but there was a desk, a closet, hangers, & a bathroom that, while still small, was big enough to use. We couldn't have been more thrilled. The rest of our stay was quite pleasant. The desk staff was helpful & polite, although the night manager (a woman) seemed somewhat disapproving when my wife & I returned separately & an hour apart one night. At checkout, we had to produce our receipt from check-in to show that we really had paid in full in advance (per the hotel policy). They keep their records hand written in a book and the person who checked us in didn't write our payment down. Overall, our experience was pretty good. If circumstances allow, I'll probably pay a bit more & upgrade our hotel next time. If budget is an issue, I'd certainly stay here again.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midwest", "Title": "\u201cLiked it!\u201d", "Author": "Cancersmash", "ReviewID": "UR8429404", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the Jubilee immensely.
