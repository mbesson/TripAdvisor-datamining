The service in the hotel was great and the room was just what we needed for a weekend trip. Our room was fairly small however the large king size bed was a welcomed addition! The one negative I do have is that all of the deluxe rooms are adjoining and as mentioned in other reviews, you can hear everything your neighbours are doing (even if they are just talking at a normal volume). This didn't bother us too much though as we didn't spend much time in the room as we were out enjoying the sites!

Very good location, modern tasteful decor and nice and clean. Big drawback is (actually this I subsequently found out, as one always do, this has been mentioned by other reviews) the room is not sound proof at all. I could clearly hear my next door neighbors having a great time laughing and chatting in the middle of the night. As a result, we have to constantly remind ourselves to speak in whisper. Next drawback is the hot water in the bath room is not that hot sometimes (sometimes it's okay). We tried to get hotel staff to fix it but they seem to think it's hot enough! Air-condition cannot go past 23 degrees, which for us was a bit cold because my hubby wasn't feeling too well and we ended up having to turn it off completely from time to time.

The location is fantastic. The hotel is on a quiet street off Via de Ripetta, one of the three major streets that run north to south throughout the city. The hotel is nearest the Piazza del Popolo- one of the quieter piazzas in Rome, which is nice after walking through the crowds along the Via del Corso where one can find a great deal of shopping and a lot of tourists. The rooms were well appointed and have a typical amount of space for a standard room with a king size bed for any major world city. I prefer to stay in boutique hotels for the character that other hotels like the Hassler or the Four Seasons cannot provide. The First Hotel absolutely felt warmer than the business like hotels devoid of any real character. There were only a few drawbacks. The location is on a quiet street which keep the noise down, but the walls between my room and the next was a little thin- I could hear my neighbors' television most of the time. The concierge were kind and very accommodating, but I am a foodie and they didn't really know any hidden gems for finer dining. That was disappointing, but all in all the team present during my 7 days was as helpful as they could be.

The first luxury art hotel in Rome is what I would call a smooth as silk and cool luxury. Saying that, I mean that there was never a moment that we felt that our needs or wishes wouldn't be met. Miriam was our welcoming receptionist and honestly I felt like somebody was offering me his own residence for a couple of days. The personel there has a way to make you feel comfortable. There is nothing snoby about this hotel. Fresh , young people are willing to fix you a drink, show you to your room, invite your for breakfast and are always there when you need them. We had arranged our airport transfer with the service offered by the hotel and although it could be in a more competitive price (comparing to other freelance transfer providers' prices) I must admit that the hotel's smoothness was extended straight up to the airport' s threshold. From the moment we left the baggage reclaim area we forgot about our luggage just to find it again in the walking closet of our room after half an hour. At this point I should mention that we were offered a room upgrade which was more than a pleasant surprise. I'm not gonna stay in the room amenities and decoration. What you see in the officially published photos is exactly what you get. I'm gonna stay though in the flexibility of the management in optimising accomodation when availability allows it. Two Weeks ago, we asked for a late check out and our flight's arrival time implied an early check in. Management upgraded our room in order to ensure that we get both and that's a five stars attitude. Regarding the aesthetics it was definitely of my liking. Minimal, poparty with proper touches of roman-mediterranean elements and enough cosinessin the rooms. Nothing overloaded, no funny gold architraves, no red carpets nothing out of date and old -fashioned. My congrats to the architectural design group (I'm an architect myself) Last but not least, catering was of the same attitude and freshness. We tried the valentine's truffle menu although that was not the reason of our travel and it was worth every penny. My palette would agree with me. Bar service was nice, eager to talk, suggest and make you feel like drinking in your sofa with friends without loosing its loungy touch. Only thing I would like to see improved would be a more robust personel presence both in the bar and the breakfast time restaurant. Both guys where genuinely interested and flamiliarly friendly but it felt like they were comissioned with a bunch of other tasks that kept them away of your sight for several intervals. Closing I wish breakfast buffet was more corresponidng to the rest of the hotel in terms of inspiration. Everything as beautiful and tasty but it missed the element of imagination. All in all.

We were welcomed warmly at reception and escorted to our room, where we received explanation of the working of the air-con and very high-tech shower, etc, by a charming receptionist and our bags were delivered by an equally friendly staff member a few moments later. Whilst not especially large, our room was beautifully furnished, with an extremely comfortable bed and a very stylish bathroom; though, along with two basins and lavatory and a bidet, it included only a shower - I am a fan of soaking in the bath and always find it slightly disappointing not to have one available.

However, in the wonderful warm September evening weather, both dining and enjoying cocktails on the rooftop bar was a total pleasure. The view was pretty spectacular as well. The one observation of concern that I would make, which I notice has been echoed by another recent reviewer, is the extent to which sounds from the adjacent room very easily found their way to ours via, seemingly, the connecting door. Fortunately, we were only disturbed in this way on a couple of mornings shortly before we were due to get out of bed anyway, but it was extremely surprising the extent to which there was limited - indeed virtually no - soundproofing between the rooms. Music was being played in the room next door, clearly not at an excessive volume, but it was as clear as if it were alongside our bed. The same was true of human voices/conversation.
