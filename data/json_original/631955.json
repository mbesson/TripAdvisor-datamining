Our Lonely Planet Guidebook also mentioned that the staff had a tendency not to smile!That said, the property was fairly nice, and the pool was wonderful. The upper units have a large balcony overlooking the pool. I was travelling with my boyfriend and his parents. We stayed at Samhita Gardens for a total of two nights, and we took two rooms (#12, #14). We stayed on the top floor, and his parents stayed on the bottom floor. The top floor unit had a traditional Balinese style thatched roof, which was quite impressive, however, had a tendency of casually dropping insects onto the tile floor! I have to admit that I am a bit antsy of insects, but the first night, a giant beetle the size of my hand dropped onto the floor! Subsequently, the next night we were host to a large cockroach! The bathroom also had a problem with ants around the sink area. This was also experienced on the lower floor unit. I believe the ants may be attributed to the fact that the towels were overly scented.Samhita Garden is conveniently located on Jalan Bisma Ubud beside the Cafe des Artistes. There's an internet cafe located across the street, and Jalan Ubud Raya is literally two minutes away from the hotel. Unfortunately, Jalan Ubud Raya is probably one of the more touristic streets in Ubud, so as soon as you leave the hotel, you're bombarded by touts.Also, beware the rooster that crows from 5am onwards. Extremely annoying if you're not an early morning person.It appeared to me that the layout of the rooms were not carefully planned or thought out. The bathtub was placed in an awkward spot in the bathroom, so that you risked slipping on its sloping side every time you got in. The lower level unit opened up into the courtyard, so there was very little sense of privacy. The furniture in the units seemed to be placed in frustrating positions, so that the space didn't seem very well used. Lastly, true to the Lonely Planet description, the staff didn't seem to be very happy at Samhita Garden. Throughout our stay, the staff rarely smiled.We paid approximately $75 USD per night, though I think there are better places for less than what we paid for. In all, Samhita Garden is a nice place that has all the amenities of a proper hotel (i.e. Days Inn), but it lacks the Balinese charm and level of service often found in establishments that probably do not even cost half of what we paid. The location of Samhita Garden is fairly good, but I'd rather live farther away to avoid all the hassles that we did.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR464302009", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "qwertyHound"}, {"Content": "La villa privada, la ubicacion y el servicio son perfectos   showReview(19584150, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR899693071", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ajsaenz"}, {"Content": "intime et typique   showReview(11027515, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR212187069", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Spatchou"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70b9\u512c\u9289\u638b\u506a\u9286\u20ac\u9288\ue0fe\u5157\u9289\u56e5\u5142   showReview(19163207, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR960466524", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Un hotel de ensue\u5e3do.       rest. al lado del hotel", "Date": "Dec 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR198146489", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "xavibox66"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d631955-r14084467-Samhita_Garden-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "631955", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
