{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good room, bad service, bad location The good:The room was very good. The bathroom was the best we had in Europe. The breakfast was excellent.The bad: It was a fair distance (about 1 mile) from the train station. I wouldn't walk it alone at night!! There is no reasonably priced food in the area.The ugly:Our group of three young women got stuck in a bad area of Barcelona late at night (after the trains were finished running)and we managed to call the hotel for help getting a ride. They refused to even call a taxi for us or to help us know where to go. They were rude and indifferent to the very real danger that we were in. Overall: I would never stay there again!! (unless I had a car)", "Date": "Nov 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR203661029", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "tigfyc"}, {"Content": "Ok if you're passing through, not for spending time visitng Barcelona       Outside of hotel", "Date": "Sep 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR205674337", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "JeremyEdwards"}, {"Content": "too far lWe stayed a total of four days. It so far from anything. There is no restarant in this hotel, From the train station it is such a far walk. Especially with luggage. The only good is that there is a supermarket next door to the hotel. But if there using the metro don't forget to get a Zone 2 pass. It allows you to get into the city. The T10 cards is good. The hotel room were ok but the floor were very dirty. Don't stay even though it claims to be a good price. Don't ask the hotel night desk men to get you a cab to the airport. He made deal to overcharge for the ride to the airport,", "Date": "Aug 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR190327846", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "wordtraveller35"}, {"Content": "Beautiful, Inexpensive and Clean!
