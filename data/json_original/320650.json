I choosed this hotel because of its price and the location of it. It is in front of an \"S Bahn\" station which is type of transport inside big cities like Berlin. Also the hotel lies inside one of the commercial centers in Berlin beside big malls and a lot of restaurants, so there was no problem with the location or the price. Coming to the food: It was good and open buffet. People working in the reception were unfriendly at all, they were insisting to speak German all the time , any help i have got it to see the city was from people working in the street beside the hotel. The room was not so good and it was cold in relation to weather in this period of year, there was a problem in the windows and when i tried to ask for help , no body helped me. I would not try to come back to this hotel again", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "Marina K", "ReviewID": "UR119018907", "Content": "I spent four nights here in a single room on the first floor (American second floor). The room itself was quite large will good amenities, such as an ensuite, wardrobe big enough to store my luggage, television (German-language channels only), and tea and coffee facilities. While the room was starting to look a little dated, it was exceptionally clean. The bathroom was new and in excellent condition. The selection of breakfast foods was extensive. There is a lift in the building, but for some reason it only stops on 'half' floors, so you will need to be able to carry your luggage up at least one flight of stairs if you stay here (half a flight up to the lift, and half a flight to get to your floor). Wifi is free, you simply need to ask for the password at reception. The hotel is in an excellent location opposite Charlottenburg station. Trains run very regularly and it is easy to get around. I arrived in Berlin at around 11pm, and felt quite safe making my way to the hotel on the train and walking from the station by myself at such a late hour. Reception is staffed 24 hours. I found the worst thing about this hotel was the pillow - mine had a feather or down filling and offered absolutely no support! I woke every day with a sore neck and contemplated hunting down an Ikea to buy my own pillow to use instead!", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cvalue for money,\u201d", "Author": "albaloo428", "ReviewID": "UR116119302", "Content": "we stayed with family in 2 separated room, Hotel look a little old and dirty, but service was ok, easy check in, free internet and fine breakfast, recommended for low budget seekers.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood place on a budget\u201d", "Author": "Stodds73", "ReviewID": "UR103201251", "Content": "The hotel was clean and I thought that it was great for the money.

BUT: (1) the breakfast is really bad (old bread, cheese etc.), (2) you have to have luck with the room - there are some nice rooms but you can also get a room where you sleep directly next to the lift, i.e. everyone can look into your room and in your bed who uses the lift, (3) some rooms are really really dirty (black hairs, dirty walls, dirty beds). Summary: Ok for a weekend but if you stay for a congress or want to make a longer stay it is not the best option.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalina1616", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel...great location\u201d", "Author": "Kalina1616", "ReviewID": "UR25572880", "Content": "The rooms are small, but clean.

Sure there are plenty of other nicer hotels around, but I like the Abendstern simple enough rooms with decent facilities, friendly breakfast room. The other really handy thing about the Abendstern is that it is a stones throw from Charlottenburg station (One minute hotel door to platform). There are overground trains every 2-3 minutes into the centre of town during the day, which is really nice as you get to see things rather than been on the underground and it's especially useful for getting home in the early hours after a nigh out. That said if you need the tube it's also one minute walk away. I've stayed at Abendstern three times now (and probably again later inthe year) , it's by no means the Ritz and may not suit everybody.

I was tired from a transatlantic flight and would have liked to check in for a rest. Then I was given a room on the 4th floor (5th floor American), with no elevator! I got changed to a room on the 2nd floor, which was adequate. I noticed construction on the stairways and construction material in the courtyard. Well, they are building an elevator, but right now there is just construction noise. It started at 7:00 AM and continued all day. Note too that on the street side there is construction on the S-Bahn across the street. This is not the hotel's fault, but it is there. After two days I told the management I was leaving. They were not very pleased but I explained that I had asked for a quiet room and was not told about the construction. I don't consider this good customer service. I also believe I was charged more than I should have as my weekly rate was based on different daily rates. This was also my first experience in Germany in which taxes were added to the room rate; I have always been quoted a rate that included all taxes. The hotel is a budget hotel, similar to the City Pension right down the street where I have stayed before. I don't expect a lot of amenities, just a good clean bed, but I should have been informed about the construction when I made my reservation and when I checked in.", "Date": "October 19, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Abendstern", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d320650-Reviews-Hotel_Abendstern-Berlin.html", "Price": "$51 - $144*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Stuttgarter Platz 8</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10627</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "320650", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/28/7d/287daaa46140ed8631c4ca5c33d11f145large.jpg"}}
