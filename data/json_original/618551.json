With loud Music playing out at night ( 3 night clubs !!!) , shady \"nightlife \" activities , bad room service and NO soundproofing this place is a complete nightmare for a business traveller. Highlights of this sleaze bag of an hotel were an Unfriendly staff that insisted on retaining passport ( since I booked thru a web portal - but had guranteed thru a amex card ) , Staff that would ask me to make partial payments since the payable has extended 500 AED , Room service that insisted on cash against delivery & had to be told the same order thrice . Horror of horrors , someone enetered my room thru a side door at 130 AM in the night !!!!!!!!!! The staff looked numbed to such minor inconveniences faced by the guests.

Otherwise look elsewhere. I always read reviews on the trip advisor before travelling anywhere but since this hotel was booked on our behalf by relative who knew dubai - I didn't think much of it. Everything you read about this hotel is true. The smell when you walk in... The main entrance (or lack of it). Both entrances of the hotel are in a car park in a small alley way) lifts are really slow, rooms are ok but dirty, shower head was broken in one of the apt. Luckily we were only there to sleep but when I asked for clean sheets - I was given yellow stained ones and (in the same sheet) a cigarette burn hole. when we asked for clean towels, we were given two per apt each time we asked, not per person (you have to ask for them, they just don't give them otherwise). Disliked - lack of service (messages left to the hotel by friends or other more important messages were never - I say NEVER relayed to the correct person or relayed AT ALL) I almost missed meeting a friend I hadn't seen in 6 years because of this and DID miss another important appointment because of this. - you have to leave your passport at the front desk - no safe is all rooms - rooms and appartment are really dirty and furniture are old and tatty (sheets, dusty carpet) - rooms were never cleaned until WE ASKED . when we complained to reception, we were told buntly - well you never asked!!! so when we asked, the receptionist said, well we can't because there is still someone in the apt... (they didn't want to disturb us apparently) - image quality in TV is bad - shower head broken in one of the aprt - staff are unattentive (requested extra pillows - never got them). when we complained to the front staff about various issues - including the misunderstanding on the day before leaving about a check-out we never asked for (they had refused to give us the key of the apt because half our party had gone, and so reception thought that all of us had left) - the receptionist was not listening and picked up the ringing phone halfway through my complaint... I just left as I was wasting my time with someone who couldn't care less. - requested the supposedly FREE shuttle the night before we left. I rung @ 4.30am - 10 minutes before the requested time - the receptionidt had no idea what I was talking about, or didn't understand english. One or the other, I can't be sure. I came down and spoke to the same bellboy we booked it with. He asked 75Dhr for the FREE shuttle. I didn't have time to argue so took a cab instead and paid the whole of 11dhr for it. - The whole seediness of the place. gogodancers in the lobby... it seems the hotel is frequented by prostitutes... (my religious uncle, was approached by one in the car park, at first he thought, it was just a friendly guest but realised very soon that the lady was offering her services...) Liked - self contained apt are spacious - The metro is situated 450 metres of the hotel on the same street. - The hotel is 2 metro stops away from the airport - It wasn't as noisy as I anticipated (we were on the 7th floor) - internet cafe (3 dirh per half hour or 5 dirhams per hour), beauty salon (100 dirhams for hair & make-up) and shopping centre at your doorstep. tips about Dubai: - Make great use of the metro (especialy coming from the aiport) Just ask for a top-up card for 20 dirhams (14 dirham is charged on it) and you clock in and clock-out on the metro (similar to the oyster card system in London) the journey will cost about 1.80 drh to Al- Rigga Road the stop where the hotel is. When you come out of the station walk straight ahead of you towards the Abu Dhabi bank building, you should be on the gift shop side. the hotel is at the end of the road on the right hand side. - Taxis take a min charge of 10 dirhams per journey and coming from the airport 30 dirhams min. All the taxis I tooked knew the hotel, but there is another one on the same street a bit further down Rigga road just called Ramee guestline hotel... THIS ONE IS RAMEE DEIRA guestline. - NEVER pay full asking price wherever you go in souks and even certain shops(maybe not malls but worth asking anyway. I manage to get a few discounts in certain shops) - Valet car park for the hotel charges 10 dirhams", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maharashtra", "Title": "\u201cNot That Bad, If You Ain't That Picky\u201d", "Author": "run4indya", "ReviewID": "UR28071759", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights on the 7th floor.

This hotel was frightening! I got dropped off in some back alley (by the way- NO taxi driver knows where it is), and went in. At reception, it took 3 people about 20 minutes to give me a room key. I had to pay, in full, upfront. I also had to give my credit card for deposit. I drew the line at them wanting to keep my passport overnight. I insisted and they eventually agreed that the 3 copies they had taken were sufficient. The room was large, but literally falling apart. The bathroom was vile, carpets were filthy and full of holes and tears, the wardrobe dorrs were falling off, the curtains were hanging on for dear life. What amazed me was that despite all this there was a massive flat screen TV! I'd rather have a nice room and an old, small TV! Perhaps the hotel could invest money elsewhere! Then there are the nightclubs. There are at least 2 nightclubs which are open until at least 3am and as the walls/ceilings are so thin you hear it all. I managed to fall asleep, but if you are a light sleeper, forget it! Then the clubbers come back to their rooms and party in the hallways until 4 or 5. That I didn't manage to sleep through! The next morning took another 20 minutes to check out. I asked them to book me a taxi. Instead I was walked to the nearest bus stop and recommended to wait there until a taxi came. I waited 30 minutes before going back to the hotel for some assistance. Their response was to send a porter to stand with me. We found a taxi an hour later. This is the ONLY hotel I have stayed in in Dubai where it has taken me an hour and a half for a taxi. I strongly urge anyone to find another hotel in Dubai!", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "NTW25", "ReviewID": "UR13664858", "Content": "My experience can be summed-up by the titile of my review. The hotel was cheap...............and I got exactly what I expected. I had planned to spend a long weekend at home and was persuaded by my wife and kids that Dubai would be a better option. I agreed, if we could find somewhere cheap to stay (given that I knew what else would be expected of my credit cards) We arrived early from the 4.15am flight from Mumbai, our room was not ready (nor should it have been) so we dumped the bags and went in search of breakfast. After some retail therapy we arrived back at the hotel around 3pm and were shown up to our room. To start with, it was huge. 2 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a kitchen, living area and dining space. I would describe the whole decor as \"tired\", it was perfectly clean, but every piece of furniture needed replacing from the sofas to the wardrobes, to the beds. In fact although the bed was quite comfortable I can honestly say I have never heard such a loud squeek from even the slightest movement (with 3 kids in the apartment, this was not going to be a romantic weekend). We did consider moving at this point, but as we were so tired we decided to sleep on it and see if we woke-up with a different view. Ultimately we decided to stay, we had a fantastic weekend of shopping, skiiing, quad biking eating, drinking and more shopping. We only used the hotel to sleep so I cannot comment on the food or the nightclubs. We were on the 5th floor so although I could hear the music, it was not intrusive, nor was the call to prayer from the Mosque across the street. As commented by another reviewer, I could not recommend this hotel, but for the price you get loads of room, it was clean and the staff were friendly. Would I stay there again......probably not, but then again, it saved me a lot of money (that my wife then spent in Emirates Mall, IBN Battuta, Wafi City, etc etc etc. I could go on, but it upsets me too much.", "Date": "February 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotterdam", "Title": "\u201cTo Ramee or not to Ramee....\u201d", "Author": "bilvertsz", "ReviewID": "UR13203196", "Content": "I have stayed at the Ramee in the past and usually get in there a few times a year. I dont know why I go back to be honest, the showers never work properly and usually there is some black mould growing in the grooves etc. However, the place does have some bonuses... It is located on Al Rigga street, there are 2 Ramee Guestlines on the street, so make sure it is the one at the Deira clock tower. There is a mosque just on the corner and you can count on that to wake you every morning if you are on that side of the hotel/appartment building. You cant escape them in the MidEast, so get used to them. The place is honestly one of the cheapest you will find, but there are several reasons for this. There are several nightclubs in the hotel. On the second floor there is an Indian themed nightclub, Iranian, Pakistani and one other I cant recall. There is a sort of sports bar on the ground floor which is ok or if you feel like it, you can go to the Phillipino nightclub next to the entrance. These nightclubs will keep any light sleeper awake until at least 2am.. so if you want to risk this hotel, make sure you ask for a high room!! and bring ear plugs!! The entrance of the hotel is also quite grotty in a sort of alleyway. The hotel also offers you a breakfast with the stay, I would avoid it and have on occasion ended up having breakfast there and regreting it later on. The breakfast place is also a dinner area as well, but once again, skip it. There is also a pizza bar which is joined onto the restaurant, it has really cheap pizzas and are actually really good! I would however advise crossing the street and walking up the road a little to \"Safadi\" restaurant on the corner (you can see a holiday inn if you look right). The rooms however are huge and are actually appartment style. You will either get a 2 or 3 room appartment and one or 2 of the doors will be locked depending on how many are staying with you. The bellboy who does this is a Nepalese guy and having stayed there a few times, I have to say he is a really nice guy and probably the best part about the hotel. Anyways, there is one room with an ensuite and one other open shower bathroom combo and a single toilet room. There is also a kitchen will full appliances and cutlery etc, but I wouldnt touch it with a stick. The lounge area is quite nice and its great to also have a dining area to sit at. The balconies are OK, but in summer, its a no go, too hot. They are usually covered in dust, so just dont touch anything out there. It is quite close to the airport and its convenient when you have to fly out the next morning.... thats one good thing about the hotel.... I wouldnt really advise anyone to stay, but I keep going back mainly because its cheap and my colleague and I can have a proper appartment to stay in with all the necessities of home.", "Date": "February 2, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ramee Guestline Deira Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d618551-Reviews-Ramee_Guestline_Deira_Hotel-Dubai.html", "Price": "$102 - $269*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Near Clock Tower, Al Rigga Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">P.O.
