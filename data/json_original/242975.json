And the stadium is about three blocks away, which was awesome! We arrived at the hotel at about 11AM, and although check-in time isn't until 3PM, they still had two rooms available for us. How nice is that? Special thanks to Carlos, at the front desk for making this happen! The hotel claims to be a five-star property, but I'd rate it more in line as a Marriott or a Sheraton, which aren't really five stars, but they are very nice. Our rate included free WiFi and free breakfast. The WiFi was not really blazing fast and you have to input the username and password everytime you came back into the hotel property. The business center had about 6 computers available all day and their internet connections were blazing fast. The lobby was very nice and the hotel staff was also happy and greeted us everytime they saw us. I reserved a room for one adult and one child and we had two twin beds joined together. It was kind of an odd setup, but I guess it works. The rooms was very clean and had a small safe, a stocked mini bar, two robes, two pairs of slippers, and lots of nice, big towels. The shampoo wasn't really good, as it did not provide enough foam and you really needed a whole bottle per person, per day. But, I simply asked the maid for more shampoo and she quickly got us more than enough bottle. The hotel had a stop for two tour bus companies right in front and taxis were always available in front of the hotel, even at 4AM. It is also within walking distance to a metro station, so getting around was very easy. Our highlight of our stay in this hotel has Pedro, the concierge! He went out of his way providing us information and tips on what to do and where to go. we always went to him for advice on where to dine and he told us exactly where to go, and how to get there. He also called the restaurants and made reservations for us, so a table was always available and ready for us when we got there. Pedro: you rock!

Do not take taxis from outside the hotel, walk down the road a bit and hail one. A lot cheaper.

This is not a 5 star hotel. Since I've stayed in this hotel for 9 days, I will tell you its pros and cons: Let's begin with the PROS: 1) Excelent Location: On Av. Diagonal. Easy access (2 blocks) to the Metro and less than 1 block to TRAM. 2) Very Good GYM / SPA: If you are a guest in the hotel, you have to pay 12 euros per day to use the Acqua Gym Spa. The gym is big, the swimming pool is heated (perfect temperature, not too cold or hot), 20 meters, you can borrow caps and - if available - goggles. There are treadmills, I think 4 or 5, don't remember and other gym equipments. Beware that they have a free 'mini gym' too, but it is too small, only one treadmill. If you are lucky, you can find it empty. 3) Breakfast. The breakfast is the only 5-star thing is this hotel. Wide variety of fresh fruits, parma ham, cheese, breads, croissants, juices... CONS: 1) Very Poor free wireless connection: It is a good thing that we don't have to pay for wi-fi connection. However, I tried to work from the hotel and access the VPN of my company, but that was sooo slow, that I ended up giving up. Of course, Skype video calls were poor also. 2) Staff (with a very few exception) were just okay. At your first day they are all friendly and helpful, but after your third day there, they don't even bother to say good morning. They are ok. 3) Rooms. The rooms are big and quiet (that's the only excelent aspect of the rooms). My room had an old carpet with stains. I believe all rooms are carpeted. The curtains were not working properly, one of its parts got stucked on the metal rail. The TV was okay: lots of local and worldwide channels. The bathroom is large, but you have to call the room service if you need more than a soap, a conditioner or a shampoo. (I needed a shower cap and I had to call the reception). 4) Food (room service). This was the ugly aspect. I was very satisfied with the food on this hotel. However, on the last day, I ate a sandwich with mayo and eggs (yes, I know... what I was thinking?!?) and I got a food poisoning.

The metro isn't too far away, but you usually need to change lines at least once to get where you want to go in the Gothic area.

A floor lamp in my room did not have a bulb. Telephone connection was terrible (lots of noise and the call was suddenly terminated.) 3) I got a morning wake-up call around 7am, although I did not ask one. 4) I used small towels in the bathroom, and I did not get new ones next day. 5) The elevators are fast (this is a good thing), may be too fast for some people. 6) My bed was slightly smelly. 7) One (false?) fire alarm during the stay.

This hotel is a Large high rise, just on the periphery of the city centre. There is no doubt that the hotel once commanded a five star rating but at this time I would say four star would be a fairer. My room was quite spacious mine was a double on the 9th which afforded some decent views over the former Olympic areas and was very well insulated against traffic noise being adajacent to the \"Diagonal\" one of the main arterial routes into the city centre. The room had stood the test of time reasonably well but on close inspection you can see where many rersidents and time has taken it's toll; I could not say this means shabby, that would be unfair but compared to some Boutique Hotels I have stayed in recently, this is a little dated. My room had bathroom halogens lights, a number of which were not working with one hanging down from its fitment. A ceiling panel was also missing, exposing the plumbing and electrics of the room above mine; being and inside bathroom, good lighting is a pre requisite. I appreciate that the non functioning halogens were replaced on day 2 but not the ceiling panel but surely these problems should have been noticed when the room was being prepared for it's next occupant. Maybe the result of this cavity exposure, the bathroom became more affected by a drain smell which while not life threatening was unpleasant at times. My room swipe card became corrupted which neccessitated a trip to the Lobby in order to rectify; in isolation this would seem a very minor point but other guest reviews complained about this also, so you would expect this problem to be erradicted but seemingly not. My television and internet service stopped working for a while before an engineer fixed the problem albeit reasonably quickly. Staff were generally friendly and reasonably helpful but I got the impression that the lady chef became a little irritated with my breakfast request for Eggs Benedict and shrugged her shoulders saying I would need to wait.. I was more than prepared to but when it came the dish was dissapointing with over poached eggs and hollandaise which was rather unpleasant! I immediately recalled a comparison with 'Unicus', a city centre hotel in Krakow that I had the pleasure of staying at just a week before; My request there was greeted with a welcome smile and a 'delighted to' attitude which showed in the dish, which was executed beautifully and served with aplomb. Breakfast generally at the Princesa Sofia offered a reasonable choice but the produce was not perhaps at the five star standard; I would add that the waiting staff were very good, attentive and pleasant to talk with. I would say that the Princesa Sofia is getting very near the time when a major facelift will be due. There is obviously some work going on all the time in Hotels as large and complex as this one but when this happens, the measure is, how well guests are insulated aginst this work. I always judge Hotels by the attention to details and the simple things that give you signals that this Hotel is indeed in the five star bracket. As an example the Lobby; on first glance it is grand and quite mpressive with a huge central chandelier but look closer and you notice quite a few of the light bulbs that make it so impressive are actually not working. If I managed this hotel, things like this would be expected to be replaced on a daily basis; IMO this eye for detail sets you apart from the competition! There were not enough satff available in the main lobby sometimes, to accomodate new guests arriving and unacceptable at this level, forming a queue! I stayed three nights in total and on the whole it was fine; but if a Hotel sets itself up as a five star, prestige establishment, it must be prepared to be judged by these standards and in this respect it fails to deliver a five star experience. That is not to say my stay was unpleasant, it wasnt but in the final anaylisis Princesa Sofia needs some TLC and investment. if this was forthcoming, I am certain it can again present itself as a Hotel that offers the cossetting and service that a genuine five star hotel can and must deliver. Before I close, a lttle about the location; I travelled into the tourist areas on a number of occasions and this was very easy via either the 'Maria Chrstina' or 'Paula Reial' Metro Stations both equdistant to the hotel in opposite directions; the Metro was fast, Clean and Modern. Taxi's though are a different matter. Yes they are abundant but all too often get caught up in the thorrendous Barcelona's traffic system making them both expensive and stressful! In closing, There is still much to enjoy about the Princesa Sofia; on balance I would still recommend it but I do hope they soon undertake a schedule of works that would bring this behemoth of a Hotel bang up to 21st century style.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cChemical Smell in the Air\u201d", "Author": "Professor44", "ReviewID": "UR109407930", "Content": "The hotel is close to a busy street so even on the highest floors there is traffic noise--it is also near the soccer stadium so there are crowds and noise when there are games.

However, the standard resulted to be quite poor with respect to other 5 stars hotels I visited. I booked a business room, not very large to be honest. Free wi-fi was available for 15 minutes only (+ 1 hour being it a business room, but I had to get in touch with the reception). The cost for wi-fi connection was then not negligible (5 euro/hr). I was assigned a smoking room without being asked in advance whether this was acceptable to me. I had to leave the hotel for a meeting soon after checking in , and I had no time to have it changed. The smell in the room was significant. When opening the window to have some fresh air coming in, I noticed that the curtains were definitely in need of some washing. Taps in the bathtub showed relevant deposit and did not appearto have been cleaned with great care. I threw a make-up wipe in the trash can and it was on the ground in the evening. I found a pair of USED collant (from previous guests) in a drawer. The hairdryer was not a hanging one, but rather a \"normal\" one, and was hidden in the wardrobe. I had not opened the wardrobe and the first morning I could not dry my hair after shower. The breakfast offered a wide choice, but the service was not that efficient (few waiters, with very low understanding of English). My table-mate ordered an espresso AND a glass of hot water, and she received the two items....in the same big cup! Scrambled eggs were definitely undercooked. Croissants were excellent, and a large variety of fruit and juices was available. I had no time to visit pool & spa.

Normally a 5 star hotel gives 2 copies of the key for a double room but they just gave one. They didn't excort to the room which was surprising for a 5 star hotel and having the front desk empty of guests The keyboard of the computer at the reception was extremely dirty. They don't have a safety box in the room!!! There was no turndown service Internet was expensive and the business center was 2 pc's Something that I found even in 3 star hotels is the emergency alarm that guests can pull in the shower or bathtub but here it was missing!!! The concierge gave very little information when asking info about city sightseeing and you must ask many questions to get what you really need to know. I asked upon check-out to credit the stay to my airline miles program and they said that it was impossible because I booked via Expedia... I asked my airline company credit my stay in my card and they did, so there is nothing impossible.

We were only staying 2 nights so didnt use it, i think maybe as a guest they could have included that.

It had a flat screen TV, but located on the desk (which was still large enough to use). The bathroom was fine, though the bathtub is sort of small. The condition of the room was fair. The carpets clearly need to be replaced, and at one point water started falling into my bathtub from the room above. Maintenance came right away, but they explained that probably the people above me had overflown their bathtub. Still, it would not have been fun had I actually been in the shower/tub when that happened. Service is pretty spotty. The people at the front desk were nice and helpful, but nobody offered to show me to my room. I don't ordinarily care for that anyway, but in this situation the room card didn't work (which meant I had to go back all the way back downstairs) and the light switches were sort of difficult to use. Plus a so-called 5-star hotel should offer that service. But this is not really a 5-star hotel, see it instead as your average, somewhat run-down, business class hotel and you won't be disappointed. What I disliked the most about this hotel is that they nickel and dime you. Internet service is extra (and quite expensive), breakfast is extra (of course) and incredibly overpriced. Indeed, food and in particular drinks at the restaurants are ridiculously expensive (E.6 for a tiny coke!). BUT, if you book your internet and breakfast when you check in they may give you a much better deal. Ask if they won't offer it. There is a starbucks and a couple of restaurants half a block away, so you don't have to eat there.

Comfortable bed, spacious bathroom (with separate vanity area from toilet, which is always nice if you\u2019re not staying alone) marble counters and plentiful toiletries.

However, I was pleasantly surprised. I found the front desk staff to be professional and courteous and they attempted to satisfy my requests. They weren't overly friendly but I found nothing negative about their behavior as some reviewers did. My chief complaint about the hotel is the 26euro/day internet charge (which is about $40 USD about now). This really is outrageous. I stayed at the hotel for six nights and wasn't about to pay this, even though my company was picking up the tab. I was attending a conference for three days a short distance away and just used the (free) internet access there. On a couple of occasions, I went down to the business center late at night and asked if I could send an e-mail or check my flights. I was told \"of course\". Other people did go and sign up and pay. Had I said I wanted to use a machine for a half hour or more, I suspect I would have had to pay as well. My room was o.k. Beware that the mattresses are very hard, although I slept quite well. I was not bothered by any noise, but I sleep with earplugs anyway :-) The bathroom was quite nice and there was a powerful shower head which I really appreciate. The overflow drain attachment on the tub wall was not secured and dropped out a couple of times - don't know why they didn't fix it - but it didn't bother me that much. The vanity was marble and the lighting in the bathroom was nice. The overall condition was good, but could stand some touching up. The furniture was a bit dated, but o.k. Also, the carpet, although not filthy as some reviewers stated, was a bit worn and a little dingy. I had difficulty turning on the lights when I first entered the room. It turns out you have to insert your room key card in a slot just inside the room when you enter. Otherwise, the lights and outlets are disabled. This is a neat energy saving device that other hotels should adopt. When you leave your room and take out the key card, the lights all go out. (Another advantage is you never have to hunt around your room for your key card before you leave - it's always in the slot). The breakfast buffet (included in my room rate) was absolutely wonderful. Smoked salmon, eggs, breads, fresh fruit, cereals, fresh juices, coffee, champagne!, mineral water, .... I looked forward to this everyday. Also, a similar lunch buffet is also very good. I don't think it was included in my room rate, but the one day I went in there and tried to ask the waitress for a bill she simply shook her head and shooed me away. Nice. I rented a bicycle during the whole stay. The porters and the concierge were absolutely great about locking the bike up every night in the baggage room and getting it for me in the morning. They also were very helpful when the bike rental guy was unable to pickup the bike on time - they held on to it for me to deliver safely to him when he showed up later.

The area is really quite and unlike the hustle and bustle of the city center but there are many restaurants and shops within walking distance.", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Horsham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood 4 star, but certainly not 5 star\u201d", "Author": "jodastephen", "ReviewID": "UR8246921", "Content": "This is a tower block hotel which houses a significant number of meeting rooms, mostly in the basement. It is five minutes walk to Maria Christina metro station, and from there it is about 20 minutes to the Ramblas/Harbour (direct). There is also a tram and many bus routes from directly outside. It is also just a short walk to the football stadium. The hotel is classified as a five star, but I would rate it as a good four star. There is porterage/concierge service and a grand foyer, but the desk staff were very slow and decidedly grumpy. The gym, pool and internet were not included in the room rate we had, which was for a conference. The room was a fairly standard size, but the bathroom was slightly larger than normal, and came with a bidet. Both room and bathroom were well fitted. The restaurant serves an excellent breakfast buffet, and a rather nice desert buffet too. However prices for the evening meal, bar snacks and buffet were rather expensive. Overall, it is a four star hotel pretending to be a five star. It was let down by very grumpy and slow desk service, lack of inclusive room services and expensive restaurant prices.", "Date": "July 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg", "Title": "\u201cParading as a five star hotel.\u201d", "Author": "B&OSA", "ReviewID": "UR7852648", "Content": "It is clear that the Princesa Sofia tries to be a five star hotel but it lets itself down on the following points: - There was no turn down at night, which we have come to expect in European five star hotels. - There was hair on the floor of the bathroom. - Members of our group complained of dirty carpets in their rooms - The plumbing in the bath and shower was faulty. - Any use of a bathroom within the hotel could be heard from all rooms. However, the rooms were spacious and well appointed. Many facilities were on offer throught the hotel including onsite ATM's and business centre.

We also had free access to the spa center and used the (big) pool, Jacuzzi and (big) gym. Breakfast was ok and the staff was helpful and nice. On the other side I can say that the hotel is not cheap, especially the charge for laundry, DVD in the room, and also room service menu can be better.

What made this stay so difficult was the fact that the beds in the hotel are VERY, VERY FIRM...it's like sleeping on the floor!! Both of our backs were killing us after 3 nights sleeping here! Also, we could hear a baby crying in the room above us ALL NIGHT LONG, so the floors did not drown out the noises from upstairs at all.

Breakfast was a veritable feast with even a cook on hand to do fresh omelettes etc and the staff were attentive without being intrusive.
