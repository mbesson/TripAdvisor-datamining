It is classed as a three star hotel,probably because there is a 'phone in the room,plus a mini-bar and air conditioning(essential in the summer) and a 'bath' as well as a shower.Our bathroom was small to say the least.....the 'bath' was a type of hip bath that you squatted in(no room to sit down properly) with a slope...you had to stand in the plug end of it to have a shower and stretch over the loo to actually get in(no handles on the wall).When you sat on the loo you could put your forehead on the wall opposite ...the room was only about 6feet by 3ft 6inches maximum,but having said all that it was very clean,and tons of very hot water.The bed was large and comfortable.Quiet at night......friends of ours had a room facing the alleyway with the shops and said that it was quite noisy,so the room is quite important.(their bathroom was bigger and so was the room) Altogether it was a very convenient hotel,and we would recommend it for a short beak.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Loughborough", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "H.Fitz", "ReviewID": "UR127597071", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Orion, it was no frills but in fact it was much better than we expected given the price.

It's great value for money! It was perfect for us because it is close to Venice's main attractions. The hotel is only few minutes walk to San Marco, St Marc's Basilica and about 10 minutes walk to the Rialto Bridge. We stayed here during Carnivale which is a busy season and crowded with people so it was great to have the hotel near the festivities as there are not many public toilets around. The hotel is also close to the San Marco water bus stop so it was convenient to arrive and exit, especially since it was just a weekend trip for us. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean. The bathroom can only fit one person at a time as it is a little on the small side but that didn't bother us as this is standard for Europe. What I loved was that it had a heated towel rack so that we had warm towels straight after our shower. This also helped to heat up the room. There are stairs so if you have a lot of luggage, be prepared to carry it up. The staircase is narrow. We packed light in Venice because we learned from last time that it is hard to get around with too much luggage. Also if you are a light sleeper, you will also hear your neighbors walking up the stairs of the hotel at night so you might be woken up if they are noisy.

It is so easy to just run down and grab food and run back up. It's basically right smack down in the bustling streets of Venice. The hotel was also pretty easy to find. Go through the clock tower of San Marco square, make an immediate right, and left on the first STREET (there is a small alley way before the street, don't go through there), and you'll the Hotel Orion sign on your left. It's surrounded by 2 gelato stands. The best gelato we tasted in Venice was the one next to the hotel on the north west side. Leave the hotel reception desk, turn left, and it's the gelato shop on the corner on the left side (same side as hotel orion reception desk). Their 1 scoop is actually a 1.5 scoop. It looked humongous compared to the ones we got by the San Marco square (which had nasty gelato). This gelateria are super generous and nice. The hotel is somewhat comfortable. We took the option to not eat breakfast and saved 15 euros per night. Totally worth skipping breakfast to go down to a nearby cafe and order something good. There were three of us, and they put us in an \"apartment\" for 2 nights. The apartment looked kind of creepy. It looked interesting in the photos online, but when we walked in, it actually had a \"creepy\" feel to it. As the other reviewers say, water flows down to the bathroom floor (because of the way the bathtub is tilted, water from the shower head flows down along the sides of the bathtub), so the entire floor become wet. It dries up pretty fast though in the summer heat. I'm sure this would not be fun during the winter though. We also had red bumps that appeared on our bodies as well, and there are mosquitos, which seem pretty standard for Venice. There is AC (the AC box is connected high on the wall, but water drips from it). PROs: LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. smack down in the middle of the action. super convenient to get to the shops/food. Best gelato we've tasted on this trip is next door. CONs: not much of an AC - just blowing cool air, but better than nothing. Bathroom floor becomes wet when you shower. We had bumps/bites appearing on our bodies during our stay. room had a \"creepy\" feel. Beds are uncomfortable.

Having said that, in August 2010, we spent an extended weekend at this hotel and below is the summary of what we liked/disliked: + central location near St. Mark's Square; + small but good breakfast (though sweet \"Italian\" only); + apparently friendly staff at the reception; + functioning air conditioning, which you really appreciate when being in summer in Italy! - cleanness is only seeming or partial in best case (staircase, bathroom), whereas bed covers & towels are for some reason stinky; - nobody cleaned the room properly during our stay, although we towels were exchanged and beds made; - thin walls, you can hear people walking up and down stairs, talking in their rooms, showering, etc. - no cheese, ham or eggs for the breakfast. The only \"orange\" juice provided was simply undrinkable. - Double rooms are very SMALL. However, in order to make money they put an additional bed in already narrow rooms and sell them as triple rooms - fraudulent, isn't it? Everything was very narrow, walking was simply impeded. Please beware that the fotos show you the hotel rooms of larger size than you'll probably get once there. My conclusion is that this hotel is NOT the best value for money, but alas, I cannot yet compare it with other hotels in Venice, as it was our first visit there. If you're single/couple and are looking for a not very expensive stay in a small room in the city centre, if you have no special requirements regarding cleanness/smell and like sweet breakfasts, then you should probably go for it, but it's definitely not a pleasant family hotel.

There were three of us staying in the room on the first night, and two of us for the remaining four nights. The staff kindly arranged it so we would not have to change rooms, so we has a large room for two people for the majority of our stay. Cleanliness could not be faulted. I was very impressed with the staff. They were helpful when we had a change in the number of people staying in the room, and provided honest appraisals of restaurants, suggesting that we travel further away from the hotel to get better quality and cheaper food. They were always pleasant and friendly. I was particularly grateful to the waitress in the breakfast area, who let us have breakfast outside of breakfast hours because of our early departure. Breakfast was standard for Europe, but adequate. They do serve you your pastry, so don't try to help yourself. There is an additional charge if you want an extra pastry. Go early if you want a cream-filled pastry, as these were the most popular. Unfortunately, there was no lift. As we were staying on the fourth floor, this meant lugging our heavy suitcases up the very narrow staircase. Not much fun, but to be expected in a less expensive European hotel. The other minor issue was noise. You can hear people walking up / down the stairwell during the night, but we didn't go to sleep until after 11.00pm, and the noise had settled by that time. We had a very annoying neighbour who unfortunately decided to speak on her phone at 2.00am in the morning whilst in the hallway, which did wake us. The beds were acceptable in terms of comfort, but not brilliant. This was my second time to Venice, and staying in the heart of Venice made this a memorable and enjoyable experience. Being able to walk by St Mark's square by night as the orchestras play out front of the cafes, devouring a gelati, strolling by the canals... Ahh.... A truly magical experience. Remember that, given its location, this is a very cheap hotel, so don't expect all the bells and whistles. Instead, enjoy and soak in the atmosphere of being in the heart of one of the world's most beautiful cities. As for finding your the hotel, it was very easy if you have directions! Face the basilica. On your left, you will see a big clock tower. Walk through the clock tower, and turn RIGHT down the FIRST street. Then turn LEFT down the FIRST street (there is a shop on the corner that sells toy cars). You will see hotel orion on your left side, about 50m down the street.

The air conditioning was fierce and also did a good job of killing any bugs in the room at night. The bathroom was a cupboard. The shower/bath had a nasty slope in it which was pretty dangerous as you couldn't really see it before you stepped in and I slipped a couple of times.

The location was absolutely perfect, 1 minute walk to St Mark's Square and 5 minute walk to Rialto Bridge and right in the heart of all the designer shops! The staff were really friendly and helpful and possibly among the nicest hotel staff we met on our 6 week holiday around Europe. We found our triple room fine for three people, we understood that it was a little bit smaller than normal due to Venice being a small island and everything being quite packed in, so that was fine. The room was very well air conditioned which was great because it was very hot when we were in Venice. Our bathroom overlooked the cute little street below the hotel and we could see St Mark's Basilica from our window. It really was beautiful. Breakfast was okay and compared to all the other breakfasts we had on our holiday it was probably one of the most stingy in terms of what you got - you were limited to 1 croissant or muffin each and if you wanted more you would have to pay. But you could have other things like yoghurt and cereal as well and it would all fill you up fine. The coffee here was probably the best coffee we had in Europe!

The rooms were large and very clean. The third bed in each was little more than a glorified army cot. My 4 year old decided it was ok for a Barbie doll, but she opted to cram into bed with her dad. The double bed was two twin beds pushed together, but made separately. Ok for us, but it wouldn't be optimum for a couple on a romantic get-away! The bathroom was clean and not too small but the shower was a joke. The bathtub was the perfect size for a small child but in no way the right size for an adult. We did not have a shower curtain; we had a folding \"door\" that was not on a track and could only be opened or closed from outside the tub. We tried one shower with that thing closed but it made it impossible to even turn around. After that we just did our best not to spray water all over the bathroom. The morning after checking in, we learned that there had been a problem with the credit card used to reserve the room months in advance. The clerk tried to reach us but could not. While he technically could have given away our rooms, he trusted us and held them for us even though we arrived much later than expected because of train delays. That alone made the showers easier to deal with. Plus, the price (150 euros a night per room, breakfast included) made it alright.

In fact our room was in the arch. Look out for the light above the door). So the location is excellent, 2 mins from San Marco, near shops, canels and a lovely 15 minute walk from the Rialto bridge as well. There was some confusion at check-in. Originally placed in a large twin as soon as we unpacked we were moved to a very small double (something to do with bookings in a similar name) which wasn't a great start. However when we returned home later the Hotel had left some complimentry Asti for us which was very nice and made up for the confusion. The room itself was small but very clean and in a good state of repair. Note there is no lift but there is a porter. We didn't use the breakfast room. The staff were friendly. Being November it was a bit chilly but the hotel was very warm with thick double glazing and very dark shutters. Also the windows keep the noise of the streets below (and church opposite) completely out.

The staff are very efficient - especially the cleaning staff - and will go out of their way to help if necessary. The rooms are fine, with the benefit of air-conditioning which allows you to close the windows at night. The shutters outside are also useful if you do not like too much light too early! We had a problem though with storage space which was minimal and as we were there for a week we ended up utilising one of our suitcases, which was far from ideal. As has also been mentioned, the shower room is very small but you do get used to it. It helped that it was kept spotlessly clean. A bath mat would have been useful as the tiles get damp with the steam from the shower and if you did not dry your feet properly you could have problems on the tiles in the bedroom! Also, the toilet seat was loose and, although we mentioned it a couple of times, it was still loose when we left. The main problem we encountered was due to the lack of sound insulation in the hotel. When we were trying to get to sleep we were disturbed by the sound of banging doors, drawers being slammed shut and even the conversations of the people in the surrounding rooms (even the ones above!). This was at times between 12.30am and 4 am (!). I realise that if the other guests had had the courtesy to consider others and keep unnecessary noise to a minimum then there would have been no problem but, unfortunately, some people are inconsiderate and the hotel should have taken this into account. All in all it is a lovely little hotel in a great location and I will definitely recommend it to others. One hint - buy a Venice card. You can order them online to collect when you get to the airport. You can get one that includes travel to and from the airport by Alilaguna. It will save you time and money on waterbuses and entrance to museums and churches. Also, get out and explore.

It is just seconds off of St. Marks Square. Actually staying in Venice at night is worth it because you can experience the romance of Venice without all the crowds and tour groups.
