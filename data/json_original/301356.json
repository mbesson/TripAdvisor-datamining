{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Absolutely Amazing Hotel We stayed in this hotel for Christmas 2008. The room was so nice and cosy and after a long tiring day in Tokyo it didn't feel like the standard hotel room. We stayed on the 12th floor and the view was just FANTASTIC. The bed was big and the bathroom was a good size. The restaurants within the hotel are nothing special but there are many restaurants and coffee shops around that area. The location of the hotel is just perfect. It is next to Shinagawa station - 5 min walk - which is one of the main stations in Tokyo. Also it is very convinient for excursions outside Tokyo. I highly reccomend this hotel.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR446302199", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "andrea-stav"}, {"Content": "Nice clean hotel, nice rooms A great hotel.

We must have gotten one of the brand new remodeled rooms because it was beautiful, had a nice little balcony overlooking the garden, gorgeous big bathroom and our room was very large by Japan standards with a desk, big flat screen tv, frig, comfortable and immaculate. The beds and bedding were spotless and sooo comfortable. (our stay at a hotel in Kyoto paled by comparison and was a big disappointment for the same price.) The bus from the airport dropped us off at the lobby almost first . The lobby is very large and grand!! Beautiful. We were greeted warmly and the people were so helpful and kind. I cannot say enough good about our stay. The location is wonderful for getting around with restaurants and shops all very close-by and in the hotel itself. Our room was quiet and they brought us in a DVD player at no charge. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on their dining. But the hotel was wonderful and our room was a definate value at a bit less than $200 for a superior twin.

The staff were all very accommodating and polite. There is free internet use in their business suite. There is also a convenience shop and small gift shop. The only downside was that you had to pay 1,000 yen to use the swimming pools, plus unfortunately, they close pools early in Japan (September).

The hotel is part of the Prince hotel chain in Tokyo.Check In was quick and very efficient. Rooms are in need of major renovations/makeovers. Carpets in hallways need to be replaced as they are worn, stained and musty smelly. Rooms are no better. 1970's decor. The carpets need to be replaced as they are worn, stained and in need of TLC. The beds are no better. The bed is very low to the ground and the matresses are paper thin. I woke up every morning with back pain :(It appears the bathrooms have been recently upgraded. As per the last review, the only rooms that have been revamped are the Club floor rooms located on the 15th and 16th floor only.This hotel offers a snack shop and botique shopping. Plenty of restaraunts to choose from, however they are very pricey. Take advantage of the shopping mall and restaraunts near by the hotel..a half block down the street. (Outback Steak House, TGIF, McDonald's and restaraunts in the shopping mall.Shingway Subway station (major connection hub) is a 3 minute walk from the hotel. Hotel also participates in the Good Neighbour Disney shuttle service to Tokyo Disneyland, the bus shuttle is free :)I would only consider staying at this hotel again if the rooms have been gutted and remodeled.", "Date": "Aug 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR235469210", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "matgor"}, {"Content": "New interior The rooms in this hotel were remodeled in April 2007.

My husband and I just got back from a weeks stay in Tokyo and the New Takanawa Prince Hotel. We were in Tokyo namely to visit Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea. We found this location to be perfect for getting to the Disney parks AND expirence the rest of Tokyo. There is great shopping in and around this hotel and the train station is just a little bit of a walk, about 1/4-1/2 mile down a slight hill. It is close to Tokyo Station (the major hub to other districts in Tokyo and not too far from the Imperial Palace), Shibuya (a wonderful shopping district), Harajuku (another WONDERFUL shopping district), Ginza (more shopping). These are the districts outside of Disney that we visited. The train system was very very easy to navigate from the Shinagawa train station.The hotel's staff were wonderful and we did not find it hard to communicate with anyone there. The room was very nice, clean, the shower and bathtub were fantastic! We received an Japanese newspaper written in english every morning. There were a couple of television stations on the t.v. that had english speaking news programs and we loved watching the Japanese t.v. programs. There also were several American baseball games on Japanese stations that we were able to follow along with!We will definately stay at the New Takanawa Prince Hotel when we return to Tokyo!!!", "Date": "Oct 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR210283653", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kruskor"}, {"Content": "Pretty Nice This hotel is located conveniently literally 5 minutes away from Shinagawa station.

Even helped to make bus reservations to Lake Kawaguchi, a great place to view Mt.

Best bet is the bakery downstairs where you can get a lot of good pastries/cakes/bread for 1000 yen.

This is primarily a business hotel and is not located in a part of Tokyo that sees a lot of tourists. The clientele appeared to be mainly Japanese businessmen, although there was a German tour group there as well. I don't think the hotel is used to Western tourists. English was barely serviceable. Our room looked like it had been decorated around 1970 and not touched after that. The bathroom did have one of those smart toilets, which was the most modern thing about the room. The air conditioner didn't work--it apparently does not turn on unless the room temperature is 73 degrees or higher. Since it was very humid for several days, it resulted in fairly uncomfortable evenings. The hotel is a couple of blocks from the Shinagawa station, which is handy for catching the Shinkansen or the subway. The airport bus also stops here, which is handy for arriving from or going to Narita.
