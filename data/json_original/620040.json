I kept on coming back to this Hotel because of the people. The front desk personnel are the best among all the hotels that I have been too. I have been travelling back and forth to NY from Los Angeles, CA and this hotel will always be my first choice. Qualities of this hotel are as follows; 1. Location is in the heart of Manhattan where there are a lot of shopping centers, good food, easy commute and everything is just around the corner. 2. Rooms are very clean, and have a very decent size for King Bed Room and Double Beds. Shower Pressure is great. 3. Complimentary Breakfast is great. 4. Beds are comfortable 5. Wide Variety of Channels on TV 6. WiFi Connection is Great 7. Front Desk, everybody, knows everywhere in manhattan, you will never get lost when you ask there where is it, anything. They know very well all the streets of NY 8. Value for Money, knowing NY. 9. There is a bar/restaurant just on the side of the bldg itself 10. Housekeepers are always nice. They make you feel very \"at home\". 11. Towels are very fluffy. 12. Great lobby and business center and meeting/conference room. 13. A lot more... Kudos to Mr Rommel Gopez, one of the Managers, he is excellent in accommodating us with all our needs. Everybody was so great and very very very friendly. Mr Paul Martinez and Robert also managers are excellent too. The Front Desk Staff, Ms Sacia who happens to be like our personal front desk (she knows everything what to do for our reservations) plus Juan who is always smiling even its 4 5 6 in the morning after we come back from a bar. We enjoyed talking to him and displays a very nice aura everyday we see him at the front desk. Russel is so accommodating too. He never says no to us, very helpful. So as Winston and Kyla. of course Mr Charles Weed who is the General Manager who is always there and listens to us especially with our concern with the weights in the gym. The whole management of Wingate by Wyndham is superbly excellent. They have a good team there and they know the true meaning of teamwork when it comes to making their guest satisfied and also in making them come back again and again and again. Like us, we stayed here for 22 days just this January alone. This is not including our stay for September to December of last year. We are very glad we found this hotel and we consider this our best hotel that we have ever been staying since we come back and forth to NY for the past 2 years. Congratulations and Keep it up. Special thanks to Mr Rommel Gopez. He is the most understanding Manager that we ever met. He never says no to us. we will be back, hoping to stay there again for the whole month of February if not 100% of the month perhaps 95%.

As many of you know, New York is expensive especially if you want to stay in the city. I read a lot of reviews and even though technically this hotel is ranked 2-2.5 stars on hotel websites, reviews always said 4-5 stars. This hotel is one of the cheaper hotels in the area, but still the price of a 4-5 star hotel in other cities. This place was great! The location was in a cutty alley, but you were in walking distance of Madison Square Garden. There is the train station right underneath it, so you can walk 4 blocks to take the train to the airport depending on which airport you arrived in. There are 2-3 subway stations within 2 blocks of different directions of the hotel. You can also walk to Times Square (8-10 blocks) depending on how lazy you are. Macy's is 2 blocks away so there is still a lot to do where you are located. We enjoyed being here because there were a lot of small eateries that were opened late for you to eat. They were all bad for you, but tasted good. The hotel service was great. They held our bags safely and the breakfast was very good. Make sure you ask what time that it's open until. The waiters were all very nice. There is a computer and free printer to use on the second floor so you can print out your boarding pass. Rooms are clean, bathroom is huge and the beds are like deathtraps. The beds are soft and the covers literally eat you up so you don't want to leave the bed. The only thing is that our heater didn't work properly. It was either off or too hot. Also when we opened our drapes we were looking at the brick building next to us not more than 5 feet away and you could KIND of see into the window of the other person's condo. Awkward. We kept our drapes closed.

We had just arrived from a week in D.C. having stayed at a lovely hotel downtown for $80 less per night. \u00c2\u00a0When we arrived, the Wingate lobby was small with very little seating. \u00c2\u00a0 When we stepped out of the elevator on the 8th floor we were shocked and disgusted by the incredibly filthy carpet. Our room although small, seemed sufficient, however during our stay it became less and less inviting to come back for our evening stay. The sheets on the bed did not fit the mattress. \u00c2\u00a0Every night at least once or twice, we would awaken to the sheet being off the corners of the mattress and wrapped around our legs. \u00c2\u00a0The sheets were NEVER changed in the 4 days we were there and we did not leave out a Do Not Disturb sign or any other notice to not remake our room. \u00c2\u00a0 Each day the bed was remade, but the sheets not fitting was very uncomfortable and unacceptable. The one chair to relax in was worn and uncomfortable. \u00c2\u00a0The desk chair did not fit under the desk and was awkward to maneuver, taking up space in the room. The bathroom floor was never cleaned because what was there after our first day, remained \u00c2\u00a0throughout the stay. The never ending fan in the bathroom drove us crazy without the option to turn it off. A magnifying mirror would have been a welcome addition. Only 2 paper cups were left in the room and not even left in a upright position or stacked. The entire weight machine in the exercise room was broken during our stay and unusable. \u00c2\u00a0The remote control for the TV also disappeared after Monday. The garbage trucks kept us awake along with the tangled sheets night after night. Although the trucks are no fault of the hotel's, we think it should be disclosed to all guests prior to check in.\u00c2\u00a0 The last day of our stay, it was raining heavily and in order to get a cab, we were told we needed to go out to 7th, almost a block away, to hail our cab. \u00c2\u00a0That seemed odd that the hotel wouldn't call for one. The personnel was friendly and capable, the breakfast very good, and we appreciate access to the business machines, wi-fi and telephone at no charge. \u00c2\u00a0The location was good and close to public transportation. \u00c2\u00a0These were not the issues. \u00c2\u00a0But for the above stated conditions we would not stay at the hotel again nor recommend it.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Falls Church, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant boutique hotel in NYC\u201d", "Author": "djsilversmith", "ReviewID": "UR119954145", "Content": "Located in the middle of the garnment district and very close to most \"On Broadway\" theaters, this hotel is a superb location off the main avenues.

The agent I spoke to for Wyndham rewards, suggested I book a loft style room which according to her and their website , is basically the same as a double queen size room with the exception of much larger windows, floor to ceiling and a loft style roof, much higher then your standard 8 ft ceilings, so everything has a much more spacious feeling. It sounded perfect. That is until we arrived at the hotel, after lunch, check in wasn't until 3pm , so desk attendant offered to put our luggage in storage as we had tickets to a matinee show, we didn't arrive back at the hotel until 8pm, to retreive our keys. Once we arrived in our room (1801) , we realized right away we were given the wrong room. The room was extremley crammed, even by NY standard, one very small window,with no view, other then a brick wall, the furniture and fixtures, were old and dated, and carpeting was stained. I was uncertain at this point if they just gave us a crappy room bc we used points, as it looked nothing like the pics on the website ( regardless, thousands of dollars were spent at their hotels to accumulate those points) I phoned right away and spoke to a desk clerk, who informed me no other room was available , and asked me to wait a minute until he put his manager on the line, I expected him to say that since we arrived so late they gave our loft style room away and he would have us in our correct room in the morning, instead he began to tell me that we were in fact in a loft style room, I assured him that there must be some mistake as we only had a standard height room, it was very small, and was missing the floor to ceiling windows. he said the ceiling is in fact a couple inches higher then standard room, and when I questioned the window, he said actually Mrs, we don't even offer a loft style room, so whoever you spoke to in reservations gave you incorrect information, and he said he'd speak to them to be sure it doesn't happen again. I replied that my confirmation information that was sent to me thru email clearly states loft style room, floor to ceiling windows, with more room then a standard room. he said again it doesn't exist and he'd rectify it with reservations ( I knew that this point he was being dishonest and he gave our room away and had no intention of fixing the problem) so I said, you should also have a talk to whoever designed your webpage, because that exact information that the reservation agent gave me is listed there as well. He replied with \" Well I'm not sure what you want me to do about this , other then me coming up with a sledgehammer and start beating out walls and ceilings\" I knew at this point I was beating a dead horse, so I just said, you and I both know that certainly isn't an option, I was just looking to receive what I paid for, nothing more , nothing less. As a business owner myself I couldn't imagine speaking to my clients this way, makes me wonder if customer service even exists anymore? Certainly left a bad taste in my mouth, and I'll be sure to tell family, friends, co-workers and my many clients travelling to NYC to avoid this hotel. Other then the bad management, the location is sketchy, beds are hard , had to request extra pillows, the two pillows on each bed are flat as pancakes, out of the 3 of us, none of us could get good cell coverage anywhere in our room, internet was also tricky, the only positive thing I could say was the complimentary breakfast was actually not bad as far as free hotel breakfasts went, but I think I would much prefer to stay at a nicer hotel , in a better neighbourhood with better customer service and pay for my breakfast!!", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Amboy, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "Keyla24k", "ReviewID": "UR117412985", "Content": "Great experience the staff was very friendly, the room and bathroom was spacious and clean, quiet room and nicely decorated, 1/2 block away from 7th.

Rooms are a decent size, clean and comfortable. There is a fridge for storing your food. The less good: The room AC is loud and boomy (as is the vent fan in the bathroom). Personally I'd recommend Wyndham sue the company who installed the HVAC. The internet was a little flakey. Every so often it decided I wasn't a paying guest and wanted me to give it money. Speed was not super high. The in room coffee machine is one of those single pod type machines. They are a nice idea but the machines are badly designed and tend to leak coffee or split the pods so that they spill used coffee grounds everywhere when you remove them. The soda machine is buried in the basement, which is ok since space is limited, but they don't make it clear in their hotel guide. Overall I liked the hotel and would happily stay there again.

My bed? A-plus for comfort, pillows, linens and down comforter. And while I'm a good camper, I know my 5-star bedding.

I cannot give high enough praise for it. I arrived the day the Blizzard of New York (2010) hit. Fortunately I only had to go out once as the streets were a mess. However the hotel was like an oasis. The room was modern, spacious and sparkling clean, the bath modern, spacious, featured a marble vanity and clean as a whistle, the bed very comfortable, a large very comfortable lounge chair (with a hassock for your legs) that made for comfortable TV viewing and relaxing. The room also had a safe large enough for a laptop. Most importantly for me, it also had a big desk and office chair for me to work at. The room also had large windows that looked out to the front of the hotel where I could see the snow piling up. I holed up here to catch up on some work (free wifi) for a couple of days and to try to connect with a friend who was trying to get to New York but whose flight was cancelled due to the blizzard (FREE LONG DISTANCE!!!). The hotel also offered a complimentary breakfast but I didn't try it, I didn't have to go out to eat as there was an excellent diner around the corner who actually delivered - even during the worst weather - so I ordered a couple of meals at a time as the hotel had a fridge and microwave as well. The staff at the front desk were superb during what was truly a very trying experience for many. I had reserved one of those express shuttles to take me to the airport and whom I called the day before to confirm but they called me early on the morning of departure to say, sorry... their vans couldn't make it and I had to find something else. I resigned myself to a very expensive taxi to the airport and when I checked out, I asked the dark-haired girl if she could recommend anyone in particular. She said why don't you use our car? Apparently taxis can end up costing a lot more than a hotel car what with traffic and wait times so I opted to go with their service instead which was a flat rate and guaranteed no matter how long it took. I was told I had to wait a bit as the car was booked for a pile of people waiting in the lobby so I went next door to the diner for a bagel and some coffee. I was very surprised when the front desk agent (wish I could remember her name!) came to find me at the diner because she had secured a SUV 4 wheel drive to take me and it was ready now. She had slogged through the snow to find me which was way above and beyond service. Plus, she then had the driver find a break in the snow so I get to him!

My husband and I made a reservation through the Wingate's website about two months prior to our stay at the hotel. We were traveling with another couple and just staying in New York City for the weekend so we decided to book a double queen room. The reviews on TripAdvisor looked good and the rooms looked spacious and the prices weren't too bad considering we were staying in Mid-town Manhattan. When we arrived at the hotel at check-in we were greeted by the gentleman at the front desk who proceeded to advise us that our room (that we had reserved) had been given away and that the only room available was a 1 King bed room, he said that to accommodate the other couple they would have a air mattress sent up, the gentleman also advised that they would be able to move us to our reserved room the next day. He also advised that the best discount he could do would be to give us a $40.00 discount (mind you we were paying $316 per night) I told him that the price was unacceptable he then said that he would give us $100 discount for the first night. Once we were up in the room we had to call the front desk a couple of times for them to bring up the air mattress, since we were going to dinner they said that they would bring it up before we came back. When we arrived to the hotel room after dinner we saw that the air mattress was a TWIN and was not completely inflated, we spoke to the night manager but he did not do anything about the twin mattress. We were pretty tired so we just slept on it anyway, when we woke up the next morning we realized that the mattress was completely deflated and we were sleeping on the floor. When we advised the managers again they just apologized. At around 3pm the next day we moved into our new room (nobody from the hotel offered to move our luggage) and the rest of the stay was fine. At check out the manager asked us how we liked our stay...once we started telling him our issues we had with the hotel he just responded by saying that the Wingate does not reserve room types, they just reserve the room. After this terrible stay we decided to contact corporate customer service, they were by far the rudest customer service personnel I have ever encountered they took down the complaint and said that someone would contact us before Dec. 21st, December 27th rolled around and we still hadn't heard from the so I decided to contact them again, they reiterated that there was nothing that they would be able to do, I read to them there 100% satisfaction guarantee policy which states that if you are not satisfied with your stay that you do not have to pay for it but they again said that the 100 dollars off they gave us for the first night was enough. All we wanted was for the first night to be compensated but the customer service supervisor said they would no do that. I then asked to be transfered to someone else that I may be able to speak to and the customer service rep said that the only person above her was the president and that I would not be transferred to anyone else.

Not to mention that the room rate included free internet, continental Breakfast, refrigerator and MIcro. I was looking at other hotels closer to TS that didnt offer internet or breakfast. So you could say that we saved well over $300. We were pleasantly surprised that the room was exactly like the pictures on their web site. The room was very nicely decorated, with ample room for 4 people. The staff was all very helpful and accommodating. And yes the breakfast was actually very good..

First, the positives: 1. The location is outstanding...steps away from Penn Station, all the major subway lines, Macy's and only a few blocks from Times Square. This is an excellent location for seeing the city by foot or by subway. There are two Starbucks nearby, as well as lots of other eateries, shops, etc. 2. The breakfast was excellent--eggs, breakfast meats, waffles, bagels, fruit, cereal, coffee, juices, pastry...the offerings and food quality were superb. One of the best \"included\" breakfasts I've had at any NY hotel property 3. The staff was very pleasant--we were always greeted with a smile, and any questions were promptly answered. The negatives: 1. The $5 per bag luggage storage fee. I typically travel to NY 5 times per year, and have stayed at many properties within this same class of hotel...I have never been charged a per bag storage fee on the day of checkout. Ultimately, the $15 doesn't break the bank, but based on principle, I would likely select another property just to avoid this fee. Very few travelers leave for the airport immediately upon checking out, and a bag storage fee is an unwelcome added expense at the end of a trip. It is not the standard in NYC, and after paying $289 per night, I don't appreciate the extra $15. 2. Cell phone and internet service were spotty at best. I stayed in room 706, and my cell phone received no service, nor did my fathers (we are both on Verizon). Our room faced the rear of the property, and was exceptionally quiet (which was another positive); but neither of us could make or receive calls or texts in our room. I needed to go to the lobby to make phone calls. Also, the free wi-fi is a bonus at this hotel, but the service was spotty. My connection worked occasionally, but was never strong and frequently faded. It was fine to check an occasional email, but poor overall. If I were a business traveler who needed frequent internet, I definitely would have been frustrated 3. The tv had a decent picture, but the channel selection was subpar; also, the ABC channel was non-existent. This didn't impact my stay, but may challenge folks hoping to see a particular program on ABC. Overall, the hotel met my needs for a quick two night sightseeing trip. I have certainly stayed in better properties in the same price point (try the Staybridge Suites on 40th between 8th and 9th for an amazing hotel stay)...but I have also stayed in far worse. If you find this hotel at a competitive rate, you will likely be happy with your stay.

We were optimistic after reading other reviews and the rooms did not disappoint. Also as other reviewers have observed, the noisy a/c/heat system is the one thing left incomplete in the remodel that cheapens the feel of the room somewhat. And, while the hotel is reasonably centrally located which makes it a better alternative than those on the east or west edges of town, it is in an area that has kind of an industrial/blah feel to it and there is really nothing nearby in terms of restaurants or cafes or shops. This is not a big deal, but it is in contrast to other hotels in midtown where the immediate vicinity is quite a bit nicer. One other important thing to be aware of (and it took me putting 4 requests into Wyndham corporate to get a non-canned answer) is that you get ZERO credit/points if you book a Wyndham hotel on any of the travel websites like Expedia or Travelocity, etc. The Wyndham website lists all of the hotel brands it controls - in addition to Wyndham they control the Ramada, Days Inn, Wingate, Super 8, Microtel, Travelodge, Howard Johnson, Baymont Inn, Hawthorn Suites and Knights Inn brands. That would have been helpful to know before I spent close to $2,000 on 3 different Wyndham-owned hotels between August and October (this one, Wyndham San Jose and Ramada Monterey).

This was my first trip to Manhattan (my wife had been previously, but not for several years) and I was very excited. The reason I chose this hotel was because it was close to all of the requisite touristy things I wanted to see as a first-time visitor to NYC. Plus, we rode the Megabus from Boston, and it drops off just a few blocks away. You really can't ask for a better location in Midtown, since there is so much to see and do withing walking distance (i.e. The Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, the Theater District) or just a quick trip on the subway (the Penn Station subway platform is only a 5-minute walk away and the 1 train will take you to lots of great places, including lower Manhattan to board the Statue of Liberty ferry... or uptown to Lincoln Center, etc.) The complimentary breakfast is fantastic, and included juices, pastries, eggs, bacon, etc. My wife and I were pretty impressed. The bed was comfy and we had no problems with it. The TV was a nice flat-screen, though our unit was having some issues with volume levels (it wouldn't go high enough to hear some programs). The bathroom had a nice big countertop and plenty of place to put things. The shower and bathtub were fairly ordinary, but the showerhead had multiple settings, which is always a plus. Our room was quite spacious and had a refrigerator. It's easy enough to walk to a nearby deli or store and grab some drinks for the fridge. We ordered pizza from Amadeus Pizza on 8th Ave. between 31st and 30th (delicious, by the way... and you can order and pay online) and kept the leftovers in the fridge too. The hotel also offers free wi-fi (which worked fine while we were there), which is great to have when you want to plan some last-minute activities. One thing I especially liked: the hotel will hold your luggage for free if you get there before check in. We got in about 11:45 a.m., and they held our bags while we took off for the Statue of Liberty. Picking up our bags when we got back around 6 p.m. was easy and our room was ready to go. When we checked out, they charged us $5 per suitcase to hold our bags for the day (I had emailed them before the trip, and they were very upfront about the charge, so there was no surprise. They only charged us to hold the larger bags, and did not charge us to also hold my backpack and my wife's purse.). The view is unimpressive (ours was of the back of the adjacent restaurant), but we weren't in the room that often. Who goes to NYC and spends the whole time in the room anyway? The only critiques I can give this place is that the restaurant has live music that gets kind of loud at night, though it didn't really bother me... and cell phones basically DO NOT work in the building. I think the hotel offers free phone service because of that, but I only called in when I was out exploring and my wife was still inside taking a nap (I knew she wouldn't get reception on her cell, so I just called the room phone). I would definitely stay here again if I was back in the city and wanted an affordable place to stay for a few nights. Sure, it might be fun to splurge on a luxury hotel sometime... but this is great for a purely sightseeing trip. We had a great time in NYC and I cannot wait to go back!", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Great hotel\u201d", "Author": "DarkPitch", "ReviewID": "UR61722710", "Content": "We were here for 3 nights, the hotel is well positioned in the city, within easy walking distance of Penn station, times square, and loads of others.

Earplugs were provided, but they don't help when you are trying to watch tv or hold your own conversation (or if you want to be sure to hear the alarm clock go off in the morning). - Shower pressure was pathetic. - The shower curtain had an off smell when I arrived and needed to be changed. This is the kind of detail that housekeeping staff should recognize without prompting. - Housekeeping forgot to leave cups in the room for several days, so I mistakenly thought cups were not provided as a policy of the hotel (foolish of me since there was a coffeemaker in the room). - Exercise room is very small with just a few pieces of equipment. The equipment all appears to be new. There is a large multi-component weights machine that was actually too complicated to figure out how to use, despite the instructions posted on the wall (and I've been using weights machines for years).

We cancelled other accoms at a Hyatt because they didn't have the good reviews that the Wingate did. The hotel is a newer looking, 18 story building on a narrow street between 7th and 8th avenues. Those two streets have the subway lines running north-south. So you are only a short NYC block from two main subway lines. We were on the top floor, corner unit. We had a nice little corner balcony which we had time to step out on day one and the last day when it snowed. We reviewed many places for location, amenities and pricing. Wingate was tough to beat. Our room had a small bedroom with a small living room. The bedroom had a huge Cal King that our 6 year old slept in with Mom and Dad as planned. The 24 year old son removed the pad from the sleeper sofa and slept on the floor. The rooms were fairly large for NYC. The bedroom and living room were separated by sliding wood/glass doors. Perfect for the 24 year old to stay up late. Their business center had two PC's and printers which we used a couple of times with no issues. Free wireless internet was great. We used that each day via our laptop in our room. Our room was very quiet except for the occasional siren or trash truck outside. The heater in the room worked perfect, the water pressure and temps in the shower were perfect. Some days we left a few bucks and a note requesting extra towels, coffee cups and whatever else and everything was provided when we returned. Housekeeping left us notes, thanked us for the tips, made up towels and our daughter's critters on the bed. The fridge and coffemaker were very handy. Plenty of outlets for our accessories to charge at night. The restaurant had a nice meal each morning from 6 or 7 until 9:50AM. Yes, its supposed to be 10AM, but they stop serving and start cleaning and chairs are up on the tables by 10:05. Make your own waffles on two waffle makers, they provide scrambled eggs, breads, cold cereals, bagels, toast, apples oranges, patty sausages, coffee, juice machines, etc. More good stuff: the location! Besides the proximity to the subways, all Midtown fun is minutes away! Empire St Bldg, Times Sq, Macys, Rockefeller, Madison Sq Garden, Penn station and much more. Starbucks at each end of the block, eateries everywhere. We hit Upper West and East sides, Central Park, Financial District, Battery Park, SoHo, Greenwich all a short ride on the subway. There is a new bagel and sandwich place next door that was great. The Blueberry cream cheese is awesome. The hotel held our checked luggage for $5 per bag on our last day. Carry on bags free. We are so glad we stayed there. To stay close to Times Sq is just nuts, it is sooo crowded, noisy and bright. The front desk was helpful. Our first night in town, it was late and we needed to eat. The cool front desk guy suggested Friday's. He was right, it was open, but what a ripoff. Go anywhere to eat except there or any other chain place near Times Sq. That meal was our most expensive of the trip and it was only for burgers/fries, chicken sandwich and salads. $23 for a burnt chicken sandwich?! Even our waiter joked that the place was about quantity, not quality. After that, we ate at cool mom and pop places for our meals and liked them all. So if I was to try and pick out some low lites about the Wingate, I would say the street and hotels on it are not as scenic as say uptown luxury. We had to keep asking for coffee cups in our room and a 4th set of towels, extra sheet for the mattress on the floor, more shampoo. If we paid a tip and wrote a note, housekeeping remembered. If not, then we had to call for the goods when we got back to our room late at night. The shower drain was open, no stopper. So on day two the small hotel soap fell in it and then the water backed up. We left a note about it and that night the problem was fixed. One night our 6 year old played around with the buttons on the room safe and it locked up on us. We called the front desk late and the 'engineer' was gone for the day, he'd be back the next day. The front desk clerk mentioned that he thought the lock would time out and then we could enter our original code. That worked and we were saved! The price of the Wingate was maybe $20 - $30 higher per night than maybe some other comps, but it was worth it to us. We were happy that we didn't pay the same or more for a smaller room, especially closer to Time Sq where things are generally more expensive. Thats it. Good family trip with great accoms! PS, The dept. store Xmas window displays were as awesome as everyone says they are. Once we saw our first one, we made it a point to see them all.

Continental breakfast was included in our stay & they have a little patio in the back. The bathroom was very spacious which is unusual for NYC. We flew into JFK from St. Louis (Lambert) and then took the A-train & subway to Penn Station. We then walked to our hotel. The hop on hop off bus was perfect for our first two days there. The views from the top are amazing. After that we used our Metro Card for the subway which was pretty easy to use. We spent one day at Ellis Island & had purchased our ferry tickets online in advance. We got last minute Letterman tickets, but the highlight of our trip for me was the Broadway show \"Blithe Spirit\" featuring Angela Lansbury.

We arrived pretty tired after a 5 hour flight. The front desk was quite but the receptionist had messed up the PC and needed 5 mins of button clicking before he could say hello. We were given room 205. The room was pretty small, the bathroom was very strange, like a walkin shower with a plastic seat in it. The toilet seat was fixed down and was a bit hard to sit still while doing the toilet! The TV was on the wall at the side near the pillows making it hard for 2 people to watch while in bed. The bed sheet had some sort of plastic material inside it?? We then realise it was a room for disabled people. At around 8pm, the disco started outside. The music was very loud and the people chatting and screaming was even louder. We lay awake until 1 am and then I asked the front desk for a room change. We booked the room in Dec 08 so I thought we should be entitled to a better room. I later heard many people complaining about noise and overheard the receptionist saying the hotel had overbooked and they were trying to sort it out. The front desk didn't seem that interested in questions. Certainly no where near as friendly as the Affinia 50 we stayed in last year. We were given a room change the next day to a room at the front of the hotel. This room was much nicer and much bigger (although I expected the disabled room to be bigger not smaller). The TV was at the end of the bed, the bed itself was very comfortable and big, bathroom was nice although the toilet seat wasn't fixed down but could live with it. There were earplugs in this room but we weren't sure why....until 10pm when the trash lorry and companies started working. It was fairly noisy but we could sleep through it. If we were given the second room to start with, we would have gave the hotel 7/10 but the 1st room was so bad and we booked so early that it left us with a sour taste. There are many hotels in the area that would be quieter, I would check them out first. I can't comment on breakfast.

Also, they have a little \"radio\" that you can turn on and listen to the ocean, birds, and 5 or 6 other \"nature\" noises. Breakfast was not amazing, but good enough for \"free\" They had hot items like sausage eggs, ham, bacon and waffles. Elevators are fast. I know in some hotels in NY in the past, I have had trouble with slow elevators. I read another review about providing clean towels.

The hotel provided free ear plugs and a white noise machine. They had a letter on the counter when we arrived that apologized for the \"garbage trucks\" that they can't control. I think it was a construction site across the street but perhaps it was a garbage transfer station of some kind. All I know is that at midnight each night the horrible whirring, grinding, crashing and clunking noises one would associate with sounds that a garbage truck makes began and they continued without stop throughout the rest of the night, echoing throughout the entire neighborhood. And we were on a very high floor. I really think it was overnight construction work. But a letter in your room upon arrival (SURPRISE! YOU CAN'T SLEEP!) isn't the right answer. Full disclosure before booking (I booked direct via the web) and then let the market tell you what you can charge for that kind of problem. They also didn't provide clean towels. Oh, I read in the letter that they've got a green policy. I'm fine with that. But when the dirty wet washcloths are picked up from the floor and removed, they should be replaced without having to make a special request. (I really think this was done so that I wouldn't neglect to put a tip in the little housekeeping envelope as I did the first morning.) The youthful staff at the front desk could have been more helpful. I asked a few of questions but mostly felt like I was bothering them and didn't really get helpful advice anyway. The extended continental breakfast was serviceable if just average but with so little variety, I was over it by the fourth day. It would have been helpful if the restaurant would have been open, too. The price wasn't horrible and the location was really pretty good. But I'd go back to the real Wyndham on the next block for a little more dough rather than staying here again. It was a spacious room with a microwave and fridge, so that was a huge plus in NYC. But in general I'd rather feel really welcome and instead I felt a little scammed. Also, I understand that they need to clean carpets and chairs from time to time but leaving me a letter that it might happen in my room some time over the next few days isn't the best strategy for the guest. They should have also told me which day they were coming to my room and then notified me once they were finished. We picked stuff up off the floor repeatedly to prepare and then we returned before the carpet had dried the day they did it, something we only discovered when we walked on it in sock feet. There's management issues here, for certain, although besides lowering the price, I'm not sure what can really be done about neighborhood noise.

There are different types of Restaurants everywhere, but we would definately advise going for a steak, there steaks are just amazing, One restaurant in particular is Nick and Stephs Steakhouse which can be found at 9 Penn Plaza near madison square gardens, and go for the Porterhouse steak for 2 at $44 per person and is more than enough for 2 hungry people and the side orders are huge!!! it is just fantastic, the staff are great and the restaurant itself it lovely. however if your feeling really tired and want to eat closer to hotel there is a restaurant attatched to the hotel called Luxe and you get a 10% discount when you show your room Keycard. I could go on forever its such a fantastic place and hotel was brilliant just wish i was still there!", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cCould hardly be faulted\u201d", "Author": "gmorrs", "ReviewID": "UR28418674", "Content": "This was our second choice of hotel after reading numerous reviews, however our first choice was not available on the dates we wanted. Firstly we were made very welcome on arrival, our room was clean, huge and a pleasant surprise to what friends who had already visited New York had experienced. We had free wired and wireless high speed internet at no cost, a safe in the room which was large enough to hold a laptop. I had taken earplugs with me as i am a light sleeper and i wanted to get some in the city that didnt, however the hotel was so quiet i didnt ever use them (room 1605) The breakfast was okay as it was free/included however it was quite basic and quite sparse at times, if you were not there early you lost out. Hot food was scrambled eggs and bacon or sausage in the shape of a burger (the thought of something shaped like a burger in the morning didnt appeal to me) and they served these 5 mornings in a row instead of day about with bacon at the start. You have to make your own toast and there are only 2 x 2 slice toasters, so if the breakfast room is busy expect a wait. My wife loves bagels and New Yorks are supposed to be the best but these certainly were not. Apart from that there is cereal, fancy cakes, tea, coffee, fruit juices and a waffle maker, but it's all help yourself and clear away your own dishes. Never used the gym or ate in the restaurant or drank at the bar. However the location is about as good as it gets, a stones throw (about 2 minutes) to Macy's, 10 mins to the Empire State Building, about the same to Times Square and 2 minutes to the subway (up and downtown) and Penn station. I would definately stay there again and recommend to others, just dont expect too much from the breakfast.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "wanderingbutnotlost", "ReviewID": "UR27774322", "Content": "I was attending a conference in early April at this hotel so the location was extremely convenient. The good points - The location is great and most major attractions are within walking distance and there is easy access to the subway station just outside the hotel. The hotel is close to plenty of restaurants. The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful. The bed was very comfortable. The not so good - The price is justified by its location, but it is very high for the hotel quality. This hotel delivers below the average Sheraton hotel experience. The room decor is dated. Although the room did not have noticeable loose dirt, it clearly was not spotless as the carpets need to be shampooed. It gives the impression that it is a high traffic hotel with minimal upkeep. The room was too warm for me and I could not find a thermostat to regulate the temperature. The spa service was poor. I was initially really happy to learn that they had a sauna and steam room, however, neither were operating properly. I was only in the steam room for about 5 minutes when it shut off. I decided to try the sauna instead, but it also was not working. The sauna appeared to be turned on, but the temperature was at room temperature. I then had to go out to the front desk to have the steam room turned back on and also told him about the sauna. He said the steam room automatically shuts off if it gets too hot and that he would come in to check out the sauna, but he did not. So I returned to the steam room which shut off again awhile later. By that time, others ask him to turn the steam room back on and to come check out the sauna. When he did, the sauna problem turned out that it needed to be reset. Somewhat frustrated, I ended up leaving the spa after 25 minutes.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in great spot\u201d", "Author": "Aussiejigsnreels", "ReviewID": "UR27617642", "Content": "We have just stayed 5 nights in this hotel and have no complaints.

The room and bathroom were clean (although I wouldn't take a bath in the bathtub), the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The location is 10 minutes walk from time square which is pretty nice but the area itself is a little icky... The bad things were the little things: first the hotel decided to be \"green\" that meant they do not change the sheets or the towels during your stay. Sure they gave us towels when we asked for them but still its a little annoying. The air conditioner couldn't stay on the set temperature, it was either \"heat\" or \"cool\" but we could live with that by warming up the room and then sleeping with extra blankets. The really annoying thing was the baggage check. The check out time was 11AM (You can ask for 12AM and its still ok) but our flight was at 10PM. So naturally we figured we will leave out luggage at the hotel. They charged us 5$ per item assuming we take it by 6PM, they would have charged us an extra 10$ per item if we would want to leave it after 6PM. That is pure small mindedness greed. 15$ per item is outrageous. We ended up taking the luggage at 6PM and spending an extra hour in the airport to avoid this fee.

Since there are so many hotels to choose - I recently found this one by a Wyndham Rewards promotion and was glad I did, as an affordable option for those frequent weekend trips. Location is decent - Short blocks to Times Square/theatre district, Madison Sqaure Garden/Penn Station/A C E, 1,2,3 Subway lines (two blocks) and really any central point to the city (Grand Central, Fifth Ave etc etc). From here walks in any direction and you have plenty of food and shopping choices - in the city you never have to walk that far or just get on the subway. Being in the garment district always makes for fun window shopping and bargins so consider that also if you have a clothes fetish. Hotel itself is smaller, clean, rooms are decent sized and newly furnished and finished. Bathrooms are new, clean and also decent sized. Flat sceeen TV, microwave, refer, coffee maker, room safe and free wireless in room. Dresser and standard size desk, and good sized closet also. For the reasonable room rates the room amenities and condition are excellent. Small fitness room and second floor open area with large TV, there is also a small business center also. There is a bar and restaurant on site which also provides the free breakfast in the AM. Hot choices of eggs, sausage, make-your-own waffles and plenty of breads, pastries, toast, cereals, yogurt, juice, coffee etc. More than the \"average\" cold continental offered at many of these mid-priced hotels now. Very suitable to get you going in the AM for a freebie. As for the concerns of noise - well I can tell you on the weekend that's not much of a problem; but certainly I can see it could be an issue on weekdays - for those lower rooms facing streetside. Obviously the hotel is aware of this since they provide a white noise machine and ear plugs in the room. An option is to ask for one of the rear rooms or at least a room on a higher floor (during the week when garbage collection is more prevelent since this street is a working-garment/office area). During a weekend it was not an issue at all (Sat/Sun). This is possibly the only concern you should have - depending on your stay. Overall - if you can get a new, clean, well amenitied location such as this for under $250.00 a night in this midtown location - it's a keeper, especially if you are training in and out from Penn Station/LIRR for a quick stay.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Stay!\u201d", "Author": "arstenor1", "ReviewID": "UR20841047", "Content": "This hotel was a true wonder!

I had read other reviews about this hotel that mentioned the difficulty sleeping in any of the three rooms that face W. 35th Street, so I requested a back-facing room but none were available. So I ended up taking a front-facing room, and was awakened every hour between midnight and six a.m. by the garbage trucks picking up the trash down below. (If the staff tells you you won't hear the noise up on one of the high floors - which is what they told me - don't believe it! I heard every garbage collection all the way up on the 16th floor throughout the entire night.) The next day I requested a QUIET room in the back of the hotel, which the staff grudgingly let me have, after reminding me several times that Manhattan is a noisy city and implying that I was being a difficult guest. (Of course it is a noisy city, but I still expect to be able to sleep when I come here!) The \"quiet\" room they gave me was right next to the ice machine, which was silent all afternoon and evening, till about 12:30 a.m. when it started making ice and woke me out of a deep sleep. It basically sounded like someone had put a pair of stilettos in a dryer right next to my head and then turned the dryer on for 45 minutes. Even with ear plugs, it was impossible to get back to sleep with that racket going on. After my second night of poor sleep I asked if there were any rooms in the back of the hotel that were NOT next to an ice machine - there were, but not if you want a king bed. Apparently, all the king rooms are front-facing in this hotel and all the quiet back-facing rooms are doubles....except for the two king rooms in the back that happen to be \"conveniently\" located next to the ice machines. So keep that in mind if you plan on getting a king room here, because it is unlikely you will get a good night's rest. (Also, because this hotel has pretty reasonable rates for Manhattan, it is almost always completely booked, which makes it nearly impossible to get a different room if you are unhappy with what you have.) On the bright side, after you make it through yet another night of broken sleep, you are rewarded with a very nice hot breakfast - much more plentiful than most continental breakfasts at other hotels...this one had scrambled eggs and bacon, toast, cereal, fruit, pastries, bagels, and make-your-own Belgian waffles. The only other issue was that the phone in my room did not work properly, so I couldn't get any in-coming calls. As soon as they tried to fix it, I could no longer make any out-going calls either....and being in the back of the hotel, there was virtually no cell phone reception. Despite the lovely rooms - which are larger than most in this city - and the reasonable prices, it is unlikely I would ever stay here again....going five nights without getting much rest just isn't worth it!", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and so clean\u201d", "Author": "DingDongUk", "ReviewID": "UR15876918", "Content": "To see a lot of the NY sights and easy access to the subway this is a great hotel to stay.

We were both very happy that I'd done my research! The Wingate prides itself on being set up for business travellers and this was definitely the case. Free high speed internet in the rooms, comfortable desks/chairs/beds and a heck of a lot more space than I'm used to having in New York City where you can pay $400/night for a tiny box. We paid $315 including tax and there was literally nothing more I could have asked for from this hotel or my room. In fact I've already booked another stay next month when I return to our New York office. It was a little unfortunate that two high school dance teams were staying at the hotel (teenage girls - you figure it out) but it was a weekend so I guess we can't really complain. Reception was terrific though - put both me and my colleague onto floors where the girls weren't. Again, what more could one ask? Except mute buttons on 100 teenage girls, but I don't think the staff could have helped much on that front. The breakfast, which is included in the room price, isn't fabulous but it's acceptable and should suit most tastes. The eggs were runny and tasteless, but we were there towards the end of the morning so it might just have been bad luck. But really it's unfair of me to complain - it was free and did the job. My only suggestion to the property is to ditch the loud pulsating music in the lobby. While it can't be heard from the rooms (so it's not a problem per se) it's quite annoying when you're waiting to meet someone or for your car to arrive.

Travelers included me, my wife, my 20-year-old daughter and her boyfriend. We were there a few days before and after Thanksgiving (Nov) 2007, partly scheduled at this time to see the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Overall we enjoyed our stay. Hard to compare with other NYC hotels as, again, this was our first stay in the city. The room was comfortable, particularly the beds, and everything worked fine. The staff was friendly and helpful with regards to hotel features, etc., though know very little about the surrounding area. The hotel location is fantastic. While there is a terrible view (typical NYC narrow street \"canyon\" with trash on the sidewalk each morning) it was only a block from the west entrance to Macy's and about two blocks to the Empire State Building. Walking distance to virtually everything, and only took us about 15 mins to get to Times Square and about 30 mins up to the south side of Central Park. I really only have two complaints about the hotel, and one of them they can't really do much about, which has to be the noise. No wonder NY is the \"city that never sleeps\" as it's next to impossible with constant police sirens. Literally ALL NIGHT LONG. I doubt there was a 10 min stretch without it. The solution? BUY EARPLUGS at one of the numerous pharmacies. Also, it MIGHT be slightly better on the other side of the hotel. We were facing 35th Street so all the noise from Broadway traveled down the canyon. If you were facing the inside of the block (north, for example) then it might be a LITTLE better. The only complaint they can really do something about is the breakfast. Granted, we were there at a busy time and the breakfast area was not planned to hold everyone at the hotel, or presumably even a fraction of that. Only about 20 people can be seated at once, with usually only one of the two waffle makers working, which could mean a 20-minute wait. They usually have eggs and sausage providing you're one of the first 30 people through in the morning, otherwise they run out. Ditto for the coffee. There are also a few donuts, pastries, and yogurt. What they have is plain but decent -- they just don't have enough of it on a busy morning. Fortunately, being NYC, there are a couple $5 breakfast places within a one-minute walk (on Broadway.) I wouldn't mind staying there again, though since NYC is so big, we'd probably look at staying somewhere up near Central Park as we didn't get much opportunity to explore that area. For midtown, though, we were happy with this hotel.

(It could use a little variety though; we stayed there 9 nights, and the breakfast was the same every day). The location is perfect, it is in the heart of the fashion district, with Macys and so many other shops and attractions (Borders, Madison Square Garden) a two-minute walk away. Subway stations for the main lines are at the corner of the street, or a short block away, including Lines 1,2,3, A, C, E, Penn Station and other main lines. Hence, the hotel is so easily accessible by subway, train, and bus. The staff, every man and woman, were courteous, friendly and helpful. Any request we made was promptly and cheerfully attended to, even if made in the wee hours of the morning. You appreciate that kind of service, especially after an exhausting day, or after 20 hours of air travel. (As an aside, I should mention that we arrived at JFK airport at 7:45pm, and made the mistake of calling for an AIRLINK NYC shuttle at 8:30pm. Not only was the driver late by an hour, he went around the 10 terminals of JFK for almost 2 hours until he filled his van. Then he did not know the location of the hotel. So, we arrived at the hotel 4.5 hours AFTER we called AIRLINK! We strongly advise travelers against using this shuttle service. Use SuperShuttle instead, which is reliable and efficient). There were, of course, a few problems (no hotel is perfect). When we arrived at the hotel at 1am, all rooms had been taken, so we were placed in room 305, which is a room designed for handicapped guests. Hence, there was no bathtub, and no closet for clothes (just an open rack). More importantly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this is critical to business travelers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was no mobile phone signal at all in that room, perhaps because the room was at the back of the hotel, with tall buildings around, and it was a low floor. This may be true for all No. 5 rooms in every floor, so travelers should specifically request not to be placed in that room. We complained, and were transferred 2 days later to room 1204, and that room was perfect. It was larger than our previous room, and because it was fronting the street, I could easily get a mobile phone signal in the room. There was a tub and a closet. And the TV was facing the bed, while in the previous room, it was crammed on top of a drawer to the left of the bed, making it uncomfortable to watch.

Even if I'm Italian I write this review in English in order to make it available for a larger number of users; in this way I hope that my review will be useful as those I've read. The hotel is extremely clean and everything seems brand new: this is particularly remarkable in a city where often the hotels shows the signs of their oldness. My room was spacious and very comfortable (especially the wonderful bed) and I've appreciated the complimentary water (pay attention: only the water with the apposite label is free; the bottles in the fridge are with a fee of 5 dollars as you can read in the cap). Oddly there's nothing else in the fridge with the exception of the water: I've found this point a little bit strange actually. Unfortunately I've to confirm the main fault that other users have recorded: air conditioning is extremely noisy and I was compelled to turn it off; this can be a significant discomfort in the hottest periods of the year. I hope that the staff is able to read this repeated signal in the reviews in order to do something to solve this problem. The complimentary breakfast is really a bonus: generous, assorted and pretty good; appreciable also the 24hour gym (even if I've never taken advantage of it). Noteworthy the internet connection, not limited to high speed connection in room: there is a computer in the business center, with free connection for all the guests lacking of a laptop. Regarding the location I've to deny who spoke about a dangerous zone: the 35th street is not the most luxury part of the town and is quite dark and dull especially during night hours, but there's nothing dangerous here. Honestly I prefer all the midtown blocks placed beetween Central Park and Times Square, but only for their glisten appearence, not for safety reasons. Totally useless add other candid pictures, since all those you can find now are really trusty.

We heard the great reviews on Travel Advisor and decided to give this a whirl. Be aware that there is no bell hop at this location and if you have a lot of baggage there will be no one to help. To catch a cab you also have no bell hop and must go down the block to Macys to pick one up, not so good when hauling all your luggage. Otherwise you can do what we did have them call a car for you to meet you at the front door. Rooms are small and clean. Breakfast is nice but very very crowded they did not allow enough space.This hotel is located in the garmet district and after 6pm the place becomes dark and full of very interesting characters. Most of which you could do without gathered in clusters. There is not a security guard on duty at this hotel either. No one outside monitoring anything. There is very very little light while walking back to the hotel after dark and all the business that surrounds the area is closed with their garage door down and clusters of men that are gathered around. It is only about a block and half from Macys but after dark it is a long long walk! DId not feel safe at all there.

Once you are familiar with the subway system you can travel all over New York, Bronx, Brooklyn etc. for $7 a day. Its the way to go.

The breakfast was good, though I personally didn't care for the scrambled eggs--on the dry side. There were lots of other things to choose from--sausage, bacon, pastries, bagels, waffles, cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc. The location is convenient, and the hotel is easily accessible to several different subway lines (1-3 blocks away, depending on the line you want.) It is 1 block from Macy's, and is close to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Now for the downside. The hotel isn't perfect, and if you are looking for a 4 Star hotel, this isn't it. It is on a dingy side street, and the view from our room was looking at a warehouse- type building. The housekeeping was hit and miss, but this could have been due to our particular housekeeper. On a few occasions, we didn't get fresh mugs and glasses; toiletries weren't replaced during our stay even though the manager said they should have been; and one day, the housekeeper forgot to leave us any towels. We found ourselves calling down for stuff like this more than we should have had to. However, the management and front desk always cheerfully and apologetically took care of the requests, so I can't complain too much. All in all, I rated it a 5, mainly because of the good value compared to other NYC hotels.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon", "Title": "\u201cWingate's a Scam!\u201d", "Author": "atvforfun", "ReviewID": "UR8103678", "Content": "When my husband and I checked out we had a mysterious movie charged to our room.

The room was wonderfully cozy. As we only needed room to unwind, this fits the bill. The bed was incredibly comfortable, the flat screen tv was a nice touch, and the room itself was impeccably maintained. Absolutely no mold or crud in the restroom,(no tub either but that's o.k.), the furnishings were in excellent repair, and the amenities were as described. It is by no means a luxury hotel, but it is a great place to stay if cleanliness and comfort are the most important things on your list. They also offer a discount on parking. Make sure you get the sticker from the front desk. The attendant was kind enough to let us know were to park, but he didn't go the extra half a centimeter to tell us about the discount. Otherwise a great trip. Within walking distance to timesquare, empire state building, madison square garden, and more. We often returned to our room at 1 or 2 in the morning. We stayed in room 205.

We pretty much went there knowing nothing about New York except for the obvious sightseeing attractions. We booked our hotel off of the reviews (it had the most positive experiences than the others.) We arrived on a Monday to our hotel - my first impression walking into the lobby was - how beautiful and modern it looked. We arrived 2hrs. before check-in, so I thought for sure they would say our room wasn't ready and we'd be stuck with our luggage, but to my surprise it was ready. We had a king size bed (very comfortable) and the room was very spacious. From the various reviews we read for several hotels - the complaints were usually: very tiny room, air conditioner didn't work, dirty, bugs etc. Our experience was far from it. Our room was VERY clean, air conditioner always worked (in fact - sometimes we had to turn it down a bit), never dirty and didn't see one bug - plus the room was the same size as any other hotel we've stayed in. The breakfast was good and the hotel staff was very helpful with our questions. We called for extra pillows and had someone knocking on our door 10 min. later with them. We saw the exercise room (very nice) and used the business office to access our email and printed out some ferry schedules. Not thinking we would need to access a computer - it was helpful to be able to use their's any time you needed. The hotel is in a nice location to some things however I think I was expecting to reach Times Square within 15 min. as previously read, but it seemed a little longer than that (25 min) - maybe I was a bit anxious and it just seemed to take longer. I really have no complaints about the hotel except that I wish it was a few blocks closer to Times Square and all the action there, but for the quality of this hotel - I would be happy to stay there again. Who couldn't use the exercise - walking is good for you, right?", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, TX", "Title": "\u201cA Wonderful Vacation in NYC\u201d", "Author": "Cherifiz_from_Plano", "ReviewID": "UR7900763", "Content": "We visited NYC in Mid-June and stayed at the Wingate for 7 nights. What a WONDERFUL HOTEL! We couldn't have asked for an overall better experience. The Hotel is in a fabulous location within a few minutes walk of subway stations, Penn train station (we daytripped into Philadelphia), and Times Square. There are also many great restaurants within about 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel and Starbucks on each end of the block. The Hotel complimentary breakfast is wonderful (we all stuffed ourselves each morning because we didn't know when we would be able to take time from our sight-seeing to have lunch). We were able to easily walk to Rockefeller Center in about 15 - 20 minutes and the subway ride to Central Park (and 5th Avenue shopping) could not have been easier. Our room was very clean and quiet. The beds were very comfortable and the flat-screen TV was great. The hotel has a very boutiquey feel to it (despite its being a chain) that we found charming.
