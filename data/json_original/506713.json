A week before our trip, the host cancelled our reservation without bothering to give us credible reasons for doing so. The good news: our money was refunded 24 hours later. The bad news..: this left us with no acommodations in Paris and during high season! We had never been to the city but we were determined to find a small but comfortable hotel with good customer reviews in St Germain or the Quartier Latin. We came up with the Hotel de Suez given the excellent reviews here on Tripadvisor..surprisingly, it is not even mentioned as an option in most well-known travel sites. I think it was a true blessing that with such short notice they were not booked. Upon arrival, the front desk staff was very friendly and although we had booked a room with a double bed, given that we were staying 11 nights they offered us an apartment they own across the street. We were amazed that they actually had an apartment to offer since it was our initial plan, and we did not read one was available on their website. We were hesitant at first but for a small difference in the price, we stayed in a beautiful,clean, well-kept apartment directly across the street from the hotel, with hotel service: our towels were changed every day, the trash was taken out, etc. We had a lovely kitchen to ourselves, a fridge and a 4 burner stove top with an oven, microwave, and totaly equipped with everything you can imagine. I have stayed in resorts that are not as well equipped. You could even see a bit of the Eiffel Tower from the windows. The elevator is basic as are most in Europe: 2 adults will fit with little or no luggage but this is fine with us. The apartment is actually a 1 BR unit with a large closet, safety box, and wonderful bathroom (the shower space is a bit small though...but once again, this was not a problem for us). There's a large selection of Paris and France travel books in the living room, a stereo, small flat-screen tv (which we only turned on once!) and everything was tastefully decorated. We had free internet in the room. Two blocks away there's a 3-story Monoprix (not the one across the street), and only once you walk in you realize that the \"basement\" is actually a big supermarket. We enjoyed buying French wine and food and prepared a few dinners and breakfast everyday in our kitchen. One of the advantages of the area is that you have every dining option you can imagine everywhere. I would recommend walking behind the Mc Donald's near the RER station down the street and you will find 2-3 small streets with a great variety of restaurants displaying their menus...they are open untill late at night as this part of the city (St Germain/Latin Quartier) has mainly a younger crowd. As I mentioned, the metro line 4 and RER B and C stations are 1-2 blocks away and we took this to the airport and saved over 20 EUR compared to the shuttle service that we paid for when we arrived. The metro may no be the cleanest...but it is very safe and reliable and it is very easy to transfer to the other metro and RER lines. We took the RER to Versailles and walked 1 block to buy tickets and took our time there as well (opposed to a guided tour...you spend as much time as you want and save a bunch). The hotel is 2 blocks from Notre Dame and a rough 6 blocks from the Louvre. In summary, we can't say enough about the Hotel de Suez. Staff is superb and always had great advice on everything. They give you maps, directions and are just wonderful. I cannot think of anywhere else I'd rather stay in Paris.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Wanderer201107", "ReviewID": "UR116588794", "Content": "We reviewed so many hotels in Paris and decided this one would be the best for location and cost.

The location of the hotel is excellent for seeing Paris we thought being just near to both metro and RER stops and near to a lot of restarants/bars/cafes. It also walkable distance to things like Notre Dame cathedral and the Louvre if you dont want to go on public transport. The staff were really friendly and helpful and it being 24 hrs reception is useful, esp not having to worry about taking your key everywhere. The room was large enough with plenty of storage space which can be lacking in hotel rooms I find. The bathroom was large and bright thanks to sky light above it with shelves in it whcih were nice so things didn't get damp on the floor. Although a previous review mention problems wiht the housekeeping we didnt have an issue at all. The room and ensuite was always very clean when we came back at the of the day and towels been replaced etc. The breakfasts were pleasant and filling, excellent hot chocolate as well, this can be served in the room for free. The best feature of the room for us was the little balcony overlooking the roofs and street below which meant that could get some fresh air into the room and also see out. We also had a small table with seats which was nice. The only small criticism id have (and it is a bit picky) is that there are signs saying that drinks are available in reception but none were when we there. However there is a small supermarket just next door which has snacks and drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, dont forget the bottle opener though!! As an aside Id definitely recommend getting the Batobus from just next to Notre Dame as a wonderful way of getting up the Seine, especially the last cruise of the night at 9.30pm as everything is all lit up and looks beautiful. Goes all the way up to Eiffel tower and your ticket lasts all day as a hop on-off tour.

We were traveling with family members whose room faced Rue Champollion in the back of the hotel. It was quite noisy with the students milling around until the early morning hours.

On arrival, a porter took our bags up to our room for us, which was much appreciated. We had paid for a smaller twin room, but were actually given a large room for 3 people (408). Our room faced the back, overlooking a narrow street. Other reviewers have commented on noise levels, and because of this we were a little apprehensive, but although there was a little noise in the evening, (as would be expected from being right in the centre of a vibrant capital city), it was absolutely nothing that disturbed us or stopped us from sleeping at all. The beds were comfy, with lovely crisp linen. Lighting was extremely good in the room, and also in the bathroom. The hairdryer in the bathroom was really good, unlike some hotel dryers, and there was an excellent extendable magnifying mirror, which was probably meant for shavers, but was great for applying make up. The bathroom was clean, shower large, with high-pressured hot water, and each person gets a bath towel and a smaller hand / hair towel. Another VERY small detail was that the toothbrush cups were glass not plastic, so they didn't fall over with the weight of your brush (never nice when your brush falls into the sink or on the floor and you're not sure if it's clean or not). There was lots of shelf, surface and wardrobe/cupboard space in the bedroom and bathroom for storage. There was no noise from other rooms. We arrived on a hot day and a fan had been put in the room, although we didn't use it as the room was fine and we slept with the window open. CNN is shown on the TV (channel 9). The breakfast area is small and kind of in the lobby, however you can request that your breakfast is brought up to your room. This is offered at no extra charge, and can be ordered day to day. We often ordered it late in the evening when we came in, which was no problem. It cost 5.95 euros per person, and was excellent value. It comprised a roll and croissant, a glass of orange juice, butter and jam, and a choice of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. We had coffee and hot chocolate, and you are given a pot, not just one cup. Both pots gave just under 3 large cups. Yes you could go to a boulangerie elsewhere, but you would pay much more for the amount that we got. We received a warm welcome and excellent service from all staff every time we entered or left the hotel, and the reception staff do speak good English. The lift is very small, but you could fit 3 slim people in, albeit rather squashed! The stairs are fine, anyway. When checking out, there's also no problem leaving your bags to pick up later on. Location-wise, it couldn't have been more perfect for us. It's so easy to get to from Charles de Gaulle. Just take RER line B, get off at St Michel and walk 2 mins up the street. Notre-Dame and the Seine are about 5 mins walk away, there are lots of restaurants nearby, there's a supermarket over the road, there are 2 Starbucks about a minute away, (if for some strange reason you don't want to go to one of Paris' fantastic cafe's). If you like steak and chips, you have to go to \"Le Depart\" at the bottom of Bld St Michel - the steak is really good, and the cafe is very French! I really can't think of anything negative to say about this hotel.

We booked a bus tour of the city through the front desk, but it seemed higher priced than other options we might have planned elsewhere or booked sooner. I do recommend taking a bus tour if it is your first trip to Paris. We took a night tour which allowed us to see the beautifully lit Eiffel Tower among other things. From our hotel, we walked most everywhere. There is a train station just down the street from the hotel (St. Michel I believe), and we were able to easily walk from the station to the hotel door, although the door is a little hard to spot.

Also, the Saint-Michel - Notre Dame metro station / train station is about 2 blocks away. The room we had (#302) was very clean, and the sheets/towels were changed daily. We had a double room with separate rooms for the toilet and shower/sink, which were both clean and modern. I have to say though that the room with the toilet was quite small... though by quite small I mean about 3 feet by 3 feet, so be prepared for those in your room to hear your every noise when in the bathroom as closing the door is more than uncomfortable. As I was with my wife this was not an issue whatsoever, and did not at all detract from our stay. The shower was great, good pressure, good hot water. Reading others' reviews we did notice complaints about the noise from the street, and ended up with a street-facing room. We live downtown Montreal and are used to noise, but this was nothing close to loud. With the windows closed all that was audible was the odd police siren or honking car. I tend to be a fairly light sleeper and had no problem whatsoever. Otherwise, the staff was very nice to us, though I'm not sure about their english as we only spoke french. They were very helpful whenever we needed anything (reservations, internet access - which was wireless and free, opinions, etc).

The en-suite bathroom was very nice and I haven't notice any traces of mold or anything like that.

We didn't order breakfast, so we cannot comment on that, however there's a choice of small local bakeries (boulangeries/pattisieries) where you can buy buns/bread/baguettes for your own breakfast. For our stay we've also ordered a small fridge upon checkin (3 EUR/night) which sufficed to keep some of the produce fresh throughout our stay. The elevator is tiny indeed (as mentioned in some other reviews) but apparently it is restricted mainly for staff's activities like luggage/breakfast, so rather don't bother using it. The staff was friendly and we haven't had any issues with them - I guess being bien eleve pays back. We weren't forces to leave the keys at the desk as well - we were leaving them when we were hitting the town and wanted the staff to come and clean the room. Also, the keys were returned to us whenever we were coming back, however, our identity wasn't checked but we had to specificaly state the room number, so if it bothers you then try finding some other place.

After reading good reviews in Tripadvisor and loving the convenient (tourist trap) location, we booked it directly with the hotel. On our first night, Christmas eve, my husband was unable to sleep because he heard noises around the room. We were too jet-lagged so we did not bother to investigate. On the second night, after spending whole day in the City, we noticed there were crumbs on the carpet. We had brought some pastries back to our room and to our disgust; looks like something had been chewing it. Hence we devised a plan, with flashlight on hand we turned off the lights and wait. About 5 minutes in, sure enough we heard noises coming from the direction of our pastry bag. At the other end of our flashlight's ray was a mouse gnawing on our bread! We saw the mouse! It ran scurriedly to a small gap behind the stairs to the bathroom where it disappeared. As if commanded, I packed while husband stormed to front-desk. The night shift front-desk was a middle-aged Srilankan man whose name we had forgotten, reluctantly handed us the key to another room. By the time we arrived at our replacement room, it was 1AM. The next morning we told our stories to the frontdesk team, Eric, who responded that \"We are aware of this situation and we are also frustrated with it\", while the other lady added that \"This has never happen before\". You are aware and you still rent out the room anyway? And yet on our checkout, we were charged for the full 3 nights length of stay. What a Christmas blasphemy! We understand that there are vermins in Paris but we do not expect to sleep with one in a hotel room. The hotel claimed that they did not charge the extra rate for the upgraded room. Well in our opinion, they would be crazy if they dare. We wasted few hours in the morning of our vacation trying to find a different hotel. But it was Christmas and most hotels were booked. We forced ourselves to stay one more night. The whole experience was a nightmare. We took some pictures of both rooms that we stayed in and the hole that the mice occupied. In the second room, (the \"upgrade room\") there were molds in the bathroom and the shower head was missing is holding place. The whole time you have to hold it up, unless you want water splashing everywhere the moldy walls and mirrors. We also took a picture of our pastry bag with bite marks on the corner. Not the kind of place that you expected from the review and the hotel website. Occasionally bad things can happen when you're staying in hotel. But to have it happened and gets ignored by Management of the hotel is irresponsibly unacceptable. For it to happen on Christmas day is an added bonus to the blow. Stay away from this hotel. We do not think the close location to metro warrants sleeping with vermins, unless they are your cup of tea. The hotel have a policy to leave keys with them upon leaving. There were at least two occasions where the front-desk staffs confidently greeted us with the wrong key when we came back to the hotel, without asking which room number we stayed in. We could not imagine what would happen if he had given our key to someone else. It's like anyone can walk into the hotel and ask for a room key.

They gave good advice on routine questions: bus and train routes and stops, money exchange, and local food. Nice folks - very easy to deal with. The Location: (5/5) - the best part about the Hotel de Suez is the location. For monuments - you are a few minutes from the Musee de Cluny ('Moyen Age'), S. Severin, Jardin de Luxembourg, the Sorbonne, the Pantheon, and if you walk ten minutes up the street you are on the Quay across from Notre Dame Cathedral. You are surrounded by shops of Rue Saint Michel and the Latin Quarter. There are restaurants of every type and price range near. There are even three cinemas and two English-language bookstores nearby! Also very important - you are a brief walk from the RER B line train which goes to both CDGaulle and Orly airports.

But it was big enough for a married couple with several large suitcases to unpack and live comfortably. Aside from size, there are many reasons to love the rooms: a nice bathroom, good closet space, and best of all - the gorgeous balcony (ask when you book - not all rooms have one). Room safes and mini-fridges are available on request. The bathroom was clean, with good water pressure in the shower. The Bed (4/5) - The mattress was comfortable, and the pillows and sheets cozy. No complaints, except that Paris was so interesting I couldn't enjoy the soft bed enough. The Hotel (3/5) - there is little to complain about in the hotel itself - it is average. The lobby is particularly friendly (big tv always turned to soccer or French news). You will laugh at the tiny elevator (an oversized dumb waiter!) - two people can fit inside (if they want to know each other well), and - it works. The Amenities (3/5) - no food available except drinks, snacks and breakfast from the front desk. Many fine restaurants are nearby. Within a five minute walk you can find everything from , bakeries, fruit markets, Starbucks, and crepe stands to excellent chic dining.

The Hotel de Suez is absolutely our favorite hotel in Paris. It has nearly everything: its location is second to none (in the heart of the 5th arrondissement); the rooms are clean and comfortable (with generous bathrooms); and the prices, considering the location and caliber of the hotel, are surprisingly affordable. We have stayed at this hotel, most likely, seven or eight times, and each stay has been lovely. We are going back next week! There are two caveats, both of them minor, in our estimation. Yes, the elevator is tiny, big enough for one person with luggage or two without. (In Paris, at these prices, you are lucky to have any elevator at all.) And the breakfast has always been a disappointment to us: like all hotel breakfasts in Paris, it is overpriced; but unlike most, it is of strikingly low quality, with weak coffee and not-particularly-fresh bread. But so what? There are wonderful cafes for breakfast just one-and-one-half blocks north (on the Place de la Sorbonne), and if one prefers sweet pastries, there is the lovely Brioche Doree' two blocks south (the Brioche Doree' being a chain bakery but still putting out product of exceptional quality -- we usually have breakfast there, as my wife loves sweet pastry). (Stay away from the overpriced and mediocre cafe at the corner of the Rue des E'coles and Rue Saint Jacques.) All of these places serve much less expensive breakfasts than the hotel, anyway, and it is nice to be out and exploring already at breakfast time. In the meantime, staying at this hotel, you will have a lovely, stately, old-style and quite comfortable room in the center of everything, for surprisingly little money.

After reading other reviews, I had to agree that there was some noise but not enough to keep us awake after a long day sight-seeing. Besides if you can't beat 'em join 'em--when in Paris why on earth would you miss out on the night life? If you want resort living this is not the place for you. If you want the flavor of true Paris this is it-- a great location, a delicious croissant, roll, and coffee that, yes, they charge for (as one reviewer complained) but where else can you get breakfast delivered to your room upon request for a few euros? Don't expect bacon and eggs--you become a guest in THEIR culture. If you want to be treated like you are at home--stay home. By the way, our bath had been up-dated even with towel warmers (tho' no tub for the spa seekers). Yes, there was no air that we could see so it may get warm in the summer but I would call and ask if there are portable units. Other reviewers called the hotel \"dated\" but we loved the old-world charm and our little wrought-iron balcony. In the morning we could swing open the french doors and enjoy the fresh air and sights of Rue St. Michel. Altho' I would have loved to see some Parisian-inspired fabrics on the bed and drapes, the rooms were clean and adequate for what we needed . The metro and bus stops are on the same block and countless restaurants all around. There is even a small but oh-so-fun elevator in this 110- year-old hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We would definitely stay again and hope someday soon we will.", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThe Satisfactory Suez\u201d", "Author": "artml1", "ReviewID": "UR5044526", "Content": "I have stayed at the Hotel (Grand) Suez on at least two previous occasions, not including this recent trip in April, 2006. Knowing the hotel, I had no greater expectations than the impression I was left with from this recent visit. The location is excellent, both to the Latin Quarter, the Seine River, Notre Dame (and other walkable scenic sites) and the Metro. The Sorbonne is just up the street as are the Luxembourg Gardens. St. Michel, the street on which the hotel is located, is a bustling, busy thoroughfare, but not overwhelmingly so. However, if you have a room facing St. Michel, traffic noise could be disturbing. I ask for a room \"to the back\" and though not \"scenic\" by any means, it will pretty much guarantee a good night's sleep. The rooms are generally small, obviously not luxurious but definitely clean. The shower hardware was ultra-modern (a change from my last trips) and a delight to shower. If you are not desirous of a fancy, magnificently appointed hotel room and view an hotel room as somewhere to sleep while you spend the day sight-seeing and enjoying spending the difference on good food, then the Hotel Suez meets all your requirements. You can have \"breakfast\" for an additional 5 Euros pp which consists of croissants, butter, jelly and coffee. That's about $6 pp and may seem excessive. However, it is more than adequate and does obviate the need to \"go out for breakfast\" which would very likely cost more. And, of course, you can always go back to your room to brush your teeth or do any other \"business\" of the day. The elevator, by the way, barely fits two normal sized adults. One person might get in with small luggage. Or you can put your luggage in and send the elevator to your floor and race up the stairs to catch it arriving at your level. As for the front desk personnel, I thought they could be more personable. The front desk consists of some non-French individuals who may have been slightly more forthcoming than the one French lady we encountered. However, I think that was more a personality issue than the fact we were American. Indeed, I never felt any evidence of animosity because of our nationality. I do speak some French which may help. In particular, I found the French police and Gendarmerie to be very helpful and pleasant. Yes, I would go back to the Hotel Suez because the price is reasonable, the room is appropriately priced (after all, this is PARIS!), the location is excellent and the rest is what you make of it!", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAbove average hotel\u201d", "Author": "Clychan", "ReviewID": "UR4565400", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed a week at the Suez.

We slept very well at night but Saturday was very noisy in the street below. French doors open to the street to allow a wonderful breeze to blow in. Perhaps the best part of this hotel is the location. Very, very close to the Latin Quarter was ideal for us. We loved the nightlife in the area and enjoyed our stay here. It's not the Ritz but it's not that expensive either. We didn't have breakfast here.
