First time: Got a double room in the basement. Stayed with a friend of me. The decor is adorable, and while on the smaller side, it was adequate and we really liked the place. Sooo... Second time: I stayed there again. This time I booked a double room for just myself. When I arrived they gave me a single room since I was by myself. I told them that I booked, and pre-paid for a double room. They told me the single was all they had. I asked if they could refund me the difference and they said no since I prepaid through another company and to contact them (actually, this was just a run around... the money was never refunded, they said I needed to contact the hotel because they should have honored my reservation so I just dropped it. Too much hassle for a few dollars). Anyhow, the single room was sufficient so I didn't hold it against them. Third time: I booked the Deluxe room (I think that's what it's called... it's the larger one of the rooms offered. My boyfriend and I showed up around 6pm and they gave us a room on the top floor. I asked before I went upstairs if it was the 'deluxe' room and they said yes. So we lug our suitcases up 3 flights of stairs and I open the door to the room and no, it's not the larger room (I know this because I've stayed here before). You can barely walk around the bed. So I go downstairs and tell them, no, I know that's not the deluxe room so instead they say they will put us up in a hotel across the street. So we went there, and not only was the room not better, I'm pretty sure there was a very loud professional working in the room next door. The next day they put us up in a hotel further down the street (wish I could remember the name) and that one was fantastic! Big, spacious, microwave, fridge, etc. I'd definitely stay THERE again. Anyhow, so as you can see, I fared OK in my stays with this hotel, but that last time it was quite a bit of hassle moving around. Further, they seem to lie or 'be confused' a lot which makes me very leary to have further dealings with them. Better off to look at some other places if you want a hassle free getaway.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing hotel for our first time visiting London\u201d", "Author": "Leesa M", "ReviewID": "UR119173157", "Content": "We were extremely impressed with the hotel, it was ridiculously clean and extremely cosy. The staff were helpful, we did try to check in around an hour earlier but unfortunately our room wasn't ready, however just down the road is a main high street with tons of restaurants and fast food which is incredibly handy. Once we checked into our room we never had any bother at all, the fact that the room came with a microwave meant that we could have a little dinner/snack in our room one of the nights to save a bit of money. The bed was incredibly comfortable also. The location of the hotel was exactly what we were looking for. With Earls Court Station literally a 2 minute walk down the road we managed to see pretty much all of London with our All day tube passes. Perfect location for sight seeing and getting about all over Central London. One draw back was that the sky light blind wasn't working however we managed to fix this, otherwise it was on a bit of a tilted slant and didn't look fantastic. Also there was no windows in the hotel room apart from the sky light so the room did get a little bit stuffy at times and opening a window would have been brilliant, the main air con in the room didn't seem to work but there was a fantastic little air con machine provided in the corner of the room which did the job. Also one morning around 7:40am what sounded like a fire alarm went off for a few seconds. Thats one way to wake up the guests!! Gave us quite a shock. Other than that the hotel did exactly what we wanted for us, although the staff seemed incredibly busy they were always polite, and we would definitely recommend staying here and would stay here again!

Excellent location, close to tube and Kensignton High Street, as well as conference centres. Room was very small, although by London standards it wasn't so bad - just enough room to move around the bed, and you could pull the chair out from the table and sit down, which a friend staying in another room said you could not. We stayed in the town house across the road, whcih I thought would be excellent for coming and going etc. Unfortunately, everytime we left the hotel our room card stopped working, so we would have to traipse back across to the main hotel and have it reset. Not a problem the first time, but by the fifth time I was getting annoyed - especially late at night etc. The reception didn't seem to think it was a problem, although clearly it was happening to a LOT of guests. They suggested keeping the card away from mobile phones and credit cards etc - when that failed, they suggested it was because I had been on the tube! Not a single apology for inconvenience, ever. I ended up just having it reset each time I walked past to the town house, to save time. Note also, the rooms are very noisy, pretty much all day. I don't think this is the case if you stay at the main hotel - but you also don't get a choice. Gym is good, breakfast is standard.

Expected to spend 7 days in a quality hotel...for 1262 USD it should have been, as I thought. When the hotel staff showed me my room I was a bit shocked if not say more. The deluxe room is in the BASEMENT! I don't know what are rooms above sea-level are? president apartments? The view from the window is...a wall! actually there are even poorer rooms with no window, because our room is not the deepest one! Rooms: tiny. Our room is just one bed and one meter around (9 square meters). We had only one small suitcase with us, but when it is open, you can't move in the room. The rooms are new and clean but very uncomfortably small and this box behind the window. the bathroom is small but ok, clean and new too. the view from the window depressing. Walls are very thin. I always heard what people in a hall were discussing or a child next door didn't like. The personnel is all not native English. And now the thing which made me write this review. We booked the hotel through an online reservation system, which charged us the money. On the third day of our stay we were asked to come to a reception and the lady at the desk said that our creditcard didnt allow them to charge all the money and they just charged us 600 pounds. But we had already paid it all 2 months ago. This was ridiculous. These 600 pounds was all we had with us for the rest 4 days of our stay in London and my bank accepts all refunds in at least two weeks. Finally the reservation system resolved the case (only due to our work, the hotel staff did do nothing, only we were contacting the reservation system and trying to understand where our money went, the hotel was not interested in it AT ALL, they could not even call to reservation system, though we provided them the number) but the hotel staff definitely didn't realize what they did. The lady at the desk was giggling while calling their reservation service and saying like \"oh, yes, I charged it, hehe should I refund the credit card now?\". Nobody cared that the situation was really serious. They offered us a complementary breakfast for this, but I'm afraid one breaskfast wouldn't help me if I had no money for 4 days in London...I'm feeling very unsafe at this place.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bristol", "Title": "\u201cWe will come again...\u201d", "Author": "roseandco", "ReviewID": "UR72582875", "Content": "This was ideal - not too expensive for London and a great location 1 minute from Earls Court tube and only about a 15 minute walk from High Street Ken, so lots of places to eat and have coffee (Starbucks, Pauls etc) nearby.

So small that you couldn't actually use the desk to write as the chair didn't have enough room to pull out to sit in, even if you were really small. Basically the room was well furnished with quality fittings, probably less or smaller furniture would have been better to move around. The bed was only a double size as nothing bigger would fit, but comfy. For location it was great, only 2 minute walk to the Tube railway station. The bathroom was small but very clean and useable.

As I am always looking for hotels that I would put a business person in, I was attracted by the location and amenities offered by the hotel. First and foremost there are truly two properties with the same address - The Best Western Shaftesbury Premier (a 70' concrete building) and the Shaftesbury Executive which is also referred to as Hogarth Execuitve Rooms by Shaftesbury (a 4 story townhouse across the street). This is all terribly confusing as the hotel staff seem to treat them as one and the same. As I was arriving around 6am, I purposely booked the night before to make sure I have a room upon arrival. When checking in I was advised that they did not receive the late check-in message and therefore treated it as a now-show. In other words I was charged for the room and they still gave it away to someone else. Things can happen with reservation, however, to make this the customers fault is not acceptable. Despite claiming they were absolutely sold out I was offered another room in the main building (Best Western Shaftesbury). The room was in the basement and had no windows at all - unacceptable. When I advised them I was suddenly moved to a main room in the building...temporarily as they said. After a 26 hour flight I finally took a nap just to be woken by staff, advising me that they now have a room in the Executive building (the townhouse across the street) and that they would be up shortly to move me again. I declined and told them that I would do this in the afternoon after resting. They were apparently not happy with that decision (as they already had a guest for the room they put me in temporarily). All the hotel facilities are in the \"old\" Best Western building (restaurant, gym, etc.) and the Townhouse has only \"executive rooms\". Having see both rooms now I can assure you that there is NO difference between the rooms. The common areas are worn and look pretty bad. The rooms on the other hand were recently renovated and look as \"good\" as the pictures promise. However, the rooms are not maintained well at all. While the carpet in the center of the room is clean, all around the edges there is at least 2 centimeters deep border of dust (see picture). One light switch was broken and could only be turned by using your fingernail. The foot of the microwave was broken and held up with a napkin that was folder numerous times (see picture). The shower-head was covered in Limescale. The heater in the bathroom had rust-marks on the floor. The bathtub had mold (see picture). The window ledge was covered in cigaret buds, coffee utensils, etc. While the main building had cable TV (50+ channels) the executive rooms had only 8. The top of the closet where my luggage was stored was covered in dust (see picture). etc., etc, etc. The short of it is that the hotel rooms are VERY small but nicely furnished, however, the property is very badly maintained and staff is very rude and unwilling to take responsibility for anything.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNice Suprise!\u201d", "Author": "Han1Uk", "ReviewID": "UR21976146", "Content": "What a nice Surprise.
