{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not recommended I felt I needed to post this review to warn others that this motel is not very clean( among other things) especially room 215. I stayed one night in 215. I awoke in the morning to see ROACHES crawling out of the vents in the microwave, they were also on the wall. I don't even want to think about where else they were crawling while I was asleep. This is just one thing. When I arrived, having reserved 2 roooms 4 months prior, the girl at the front desk had knowledge of only one room being held. I had reserved 2 rooms for 4 days and had luckly made arrangements for rooms next to each other for the 2nd day as my mother and I were at opposite ends of the motel. I was able the get out of the roach room.. Number 215 also had a door key system that did not work, locked me out of the room every time I closed the door, I had to go to the front desk 3 times to have them reprogram my key. The room was so dark I could hardly see in the bathroom. The toilet overflowed, which must happpen frequently as there was a plunged next to the toilet. The shower leaked onto the floor and flooded out the bathroom, I had to used all the towels to clean the floor. The girl at the front desk during the day could absolutely care less about customer service, even when told of the roaches in the room. There is a very nice and helpful man at the desk in the evening the only good thing about the motel. I left a note at the front desk regarding all of the above but have no way of knowing if anyone ever saw it or even cared.", "Date": "Sep 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR827614922", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "SanFranciscotravler"}, {"Content": "Rude A-Hole wouldn't honour my reservation (booked 2 months ahead) I arrived on a Thursday night for a 4 night stay. I had reserved a room 2 months in advance.When I arrived the rude a-hole at the desk first tried to tell me that I wasn't even in the system. Then once I showed him the print out that confirmed the reservation, he said that he had no rooms.I asked him what the point of giving him my credit card info and reserving ahead of time was, and he said that I had cancelled my reservation before by telephone.When I told him that I had not cancelled by telephone, he said that I had cancelled by internet. When I asked him why I never received an email confirmation of the cancellation, he told me that it didn't matter. I had cancelled by either telephone or email or something and that another hotel of his down the street would honour my reservation and rates. Then he told me to leave.I went down the street to the other hotel, and the gentleman there said that he didn't even know what I was talking about and that he would not honour my reservation and that he wanted $160 + tax in CASH, with 4 nights upfront. My reserved rate at the original hotel was $115 + tax so I was a little upset.He showed me the room he had and it smelled badly of puke. I told him that there was no way I was paying $160 + tax in cash for a room that smelled like puke. He then said $140 + tax / night in Cash. I told him to [--] and left.I ended up crashing on the floor of my buddies' room for that night.Magically the next day, the original hotel found me a room with 1 King Size instead of 2 Queens. I begrudgingly took it, but make no mistake, these guys are a-holes with no integrity. They will not honour your reservation, no matter how far ahead you book it, if they get a better offer.BEWARE!!!Other than that, the King Size room I got was fine for the price. It would have been even better if I didn't have to deal with a rude [--] at the counter and didn't have to sleep on the floor after spending hours looking for a room the night before.The girl who set me up with a room on the second day seemed nice enough though, but she still wasn't much help.", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR382782202", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "OneManJam"}, {"Content": "Hidden Gem Who knew such an inexpensive quaint little motel would be tucked blocks from Fisherman's Wharf? What we got for $70 a night: clean comfortable bed (better than some high-priced hotels), bus stops on the corner, free off-street parking, free wireless Internet, microwave and refrigerator. Staff was friendly and helpful. An adequate continental breakfast of pastries and fruit was enough to get you going. I would have preferred a coffee maker in the room instead of in the lobby. Even though it is only 3 stories, there was a working elevator. As we were checking out, my husband pointed out that we had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I thought he was joking, but a section was visible from the 3rd floor balcony! We had not seen it before because of the ever-present fog.I highly recommend this motel.

The owners have obviously invested a lot in the hotel (considerating its location). So, why after all that, would you hire the worst desk clerks ever? Upon check in, the first clerk initially refused to give me two (plastic keycard-type) keys to the room. When I persisted (repeatedly and emphatically), he finally gave me two keys.The night desk clerk was the worst, though. I wanted to get rid of some coins I'd accumulated, so I asked for dollars instead. He would only do this for ONE dollar. He said rudely, I don't need any more change. I asked if he would do it as a customer service, even if he didn't need the change. He rudely just said, No.The same night desk clerk refused to give me extra towels. Absolutely unbelievable.When I asked to speak with the manager to try to get more towels, the rude clerk said the manager wasn't there. When I asked him to call the manager (who was probably living on the property, as many hotel managers do), he said he didn't have the phone number.Needless to say, I wouldn't stay there again.

Not as bad as the reviews had me expecting. The rooms are basic but fairly clean. Motel staff were very helpful; quickly providing additional pillows and a missing chair from my room(??) . Very good coffee in the motel lobby in the morning.  I would likely find a hotel more on the outskirts of the city next time.....and then use public transportation rather than renting a car.

After reading the reviews from websites I was skeptical about coming here. On average, this hotel had only been rated at about a 60% recommendation rate. It's obviously not the Hilton or the Fairmont, but if you are looking for a place to stay for a great price, this place is for you. Our room (on the 2nd level) is completely renovated, has Free High-Speed Internet, a new 27 TV, new furniture, and is extremely clean. The rooms are all equipped with an ironing board and hair dryer, soaps and shampoos, we got a free breakfast, and FREE parking with in and out privileges. The parking lot is really crammed, so there is double parking. Just to be safe, you want to make sure that you check in early in the daytime (before 4pm) to ensure you get a parking spot. The staff was friendly, and they gladly accepted the coupon (that we got in a Travel booklet from Denny\u9225\u6a9a) that have us the room for $49- No hesitations. We walked to Fisherman\u9225\u6a9a Wharf in 10 minutes, and we were at Pier 39 in 15 mins, can\u9225\u6a9b ask for a better location. My only caution is to those who are light sleepers. There is a lot of traffic on the street, and since the hotel is shaped like a U, the noise gets trapped in easily. I requested a wake up call, turned the clock radio on an easy listening radio station and slept like a log. It looks rough from the outside, but it\u9225\u6a9a worth a shot. In fact, the staff encouraged us to look at the room before we booked it. I will return to this hotel for sure.", "Date": "Feb 24, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR168283899", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "jvalois"}, {"Content": "horrible, avoid at all costs The room, especially the bathroom was filthy.
