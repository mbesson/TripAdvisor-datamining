Hotel Magenta by itself is quite alright. Whole hotel was filled WIFI hotspots. Service was professional in English. At night the door was locked unless you ring the bell to make sure you were a tourist-like figure. I would say the purple / magenta color theme hid its aged building rather well, though personally I would prefer brighter, whiter hotels so the carpets won't look the same no matter it's washed or not. My room had a double bed with adequate size (not big in any sense but okay). It had a large window facing interior squares facing other apartments which were quite comfortable and quiet. The noises were mainly from the other travelers who returned late or left early, but it was still manageable. The problem I see are similar to what Paul_Glynis below mentioned: the location. While it was conveniently located *near* 2 RER train stations. You can see clearly that areas near train stations aren't the best place to stay for more than 1 nights in Paris. The fact for this hotel is, we would still need to take 1 subway change to arrive our hotel (or you may walk for 10-15min if you are luggage free). What that means to a traveler with luggage is that, there's not much point to stay near the train station but not close to it because we still had to carry the heavy luggage to travel through those stupid stairs in subway tunnels and exits. On our way leaving Paris we simply took buses transferring to Opera to take the airport bus because we were just so tired to take the luggage with us via subways - which weren't too safe esp in RER train stations.

One romantic observation was the realisation we could see the top of the Eiffel Tower from our room.

I especially liked the fact that I got a free upgrade to the deluxe room. Room was lovely and big and very warm. Could have been a bit more modern though considering (red carpet, older style phone and bathroom were a bit disappointing). Had breakfats included which I had brought up to my room free of charge. Consisted of pastries, bread, juice. Tea and coffee were provided free in the room. I tend to like really modern hotels which is why I'm probably a bit critical. The bathroom was by no means old, but not recently installed either., and there was a soap dispenser in the shower instead of the standard mini toiletries that are usually provided. Staff were friendly and helpful. However, the area would prevent me from going back, even if it was for one night. The area felt really quite run down compared to other places I had seen in Paris. Whilst the metro is about 2minutes walk away, it didn't feel like the safest of places, especially as a tourist. Then about 5-10mins up the road is Gare d'lest and Gare du Nord. I asked one of the locals if these areas were safe and he said 'no, not really'. I stayed here on New Years eve, and got the metro to meet some friends. On my way out of Gare du Nord station (at around 11pm) I was accosted by a group of about 10 drunk immigrant men. I'm lucky I wasn't assaulted or hurt in anyway, but that did make me feel very unsafe. On the way back from the NYE merriments, my friend and her boyfriend walked me back to my hotel from Gare d'lest, and it was more of the same seedy leery behaviour by really unsavoury characters.

On the whole the hotel was ok, certainly not as good as I had hoped, nothing special. The location was the best thing going for it, only a few mins walk to Gare de L'est. The rooms were fine but didn't look as good as they appear on the internet, extremely small. Had a TV but the signal was dreadful so couldn't watch it. The bathroom was good with power shower and clean white towels. The bed was actually very comfortable. Free safe in rooms (if you dare use, see below), free tea/coffee making facilities. Breakfast again was ok but they have gone for a modern look rather than comfort. The chairs might be ultra modern but so uncomfortable. Good choice of foods available. Unfortunately what happened on our last night ruined our trip and the hotel management is appalling. My mum used the safe in her room (we had 2 rooms) and on the last night which was meant to be a special night as it was her birthday, mum put her code in to open the safe and it kept saying error. Went to reception and were told she couldn't leave reception to help until next shift came in 30mins later. Weren't happy but had no choice to wait as all money and cards in safe. Eventually next receptionist came up, leaving desk unmanned, and couldn't do anything to fix it. The previous receptionist just didn't want to help; they work alone 12 hour shifts so they obviously had to leave reception to get drinks or go to toilet etc. He then said he didn't know what to do and when he got chance he would have a think. It was 8.15pm by then and I said it was meant to be a special night but he was not interested. I literally had to wait in reception for ages until he would do anything. I asked him to ring hotel manager and he said he's not in Paris. When I asked what he would do in an emergency, he suddenly couldn't spesk English very well. After hours of waiting around he said he would try the battery, which it was, and it took until 10pm to resolve the problem which ruined our night out. I know batteries do fail etc that's fine but it was the way it was managed, with the no care attitude that I have a problem with, and there was no apology for ruining my mum's birthday. If they had any conscience, they would of offered to lend us money to go out or offer to refund us our last night, as they ruined it. If this is how they manage problems, I certainly wouldn't recommend this hotel. I was also really surprised that the hotel did nothing at all for my mum's birthday. They knew about it prior to our arrival; I put banners up in her room, so they couldn't say they didn't know. I have been away for loads of birthday's and every hotel has always done something, however small, even a bottle of wine but nothing at all from Magenta Paris. Overall Paris was great. but extremely expensive, 5 euros for a soft drink and 7 euros for small beer. The brasserie opposite hotel was great. Brilliant food at great price, well worth a visit. Did the tour bus over 2 days (the red one), well worth the money and metro was excellent to get around. Had a nice time but such a shame my mum's birthday was ruined by a poorly run hotel with unfriendly staff. Probably wouldn't return to Paris in a hurry as seen everything and too expensive.

People have previously mentioned the place being dirty, the food being bad and the noise all night preventing a decent nights sleep. The negative reviews could quite easily put people off, we were very wary after reading them. We stayed for 5 days, the hotel is very clean, all the staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfasts are nice too. As for the noise in the street, we live in a fairly quiet area and we slept well every night and had the window open too as Paris was quite hot last week. If you arrive by plane from CDG then you will travel by train to the Gare Du Nord station, you can then change trains or walk from there, to be honest we walked but had we known before hand we would have changed trains and gone to the Jacques Bonsergent metro as it's miles easier and is literally 1 minute away from the hotel compared with 10 minutes from Gare Du Nord or 5 minutes from Gare De L'est, and when you have cases to drag about that makes a big difference. If you like Chinese food there is also a great place 'Ching Chongs' near the Gare De L'est that do a buffet for 12 Euros on a night or 9 Euros during the day. The only down side for us was the area that the hotel is located in, there are 2 streets very close by, Rue La Fayette & Boulevard De Strasbourg that didn't make us feel safe, especially later in the day, there is also a brasserie directly opposite the hotel that ripped us off with the price of some drinks. Although classed as a city centre hotel it is a little way out and if you don't walk as much as we do then you will definately have to take the metro. On the positive side we'd definately stay at the hotel again, on the negative side it probably won't happen as the nice sights of Paris are completely overshadowed by the scruffy parts and the feeling of not being safe. An american at the hotel was distracted and then pick pocketed, he lost $1000. I'd recommend a visit to the Moulin Rouge while in Paris, we went on a trip with Cityrama that included an illuminations tour and champagne and they even drop you back at your hotel afterwards, it's not cheap but then again nothing else was either. If your doing a shortlist of 10 city breaks to take then Paris should be on it, simply because it's Paris, but no higher than number 10, go to Rome instead. Everything in Paris is very expensive compared to other cities and that includes travel, the train from the airport to the closest metro was roughy 13 Euros each. We travelled a very similar distance when we went to Rome, the trains were the same and the trip was 1 Euro each.

But I felt compelled to after my stay at this hotel. I am always baffled as to some of the comments people put on here, so let me put it in my simple terms... Hotel was excellent. Granted, a little pricey for what you get, but just make sure you book it through a good website (lastminute.com etc), where I had it half price, and it was ACTUALLY half price. And besides, what do you expect? You're going to Paris! Don't listen to the people who say that it's miles away from the attractions and sights...if they had opened their eyes they would have seen the Metro and ridiculously cheap hire bikes that are simply amazing! Pick them up at one location, drop them off at another, do what you need to do, pick another one up at a different station. Truly a great idea! And going on the Metro is part of going to Paris! Also unbelievably cheap. There are several cracking restaurants and bars within spitting distance of the hotel. In fact, there is one DIRECTLY OPPOSITE that had lovely traditional live French music at the weekends, and the staff were superb. And about 5-10 minutes\u2019 walk away we found an amazing market place on the Sunday, full of fresh vegetables, cheese, wine, seafood, anything you could wish for. The hotel is a weird pink colour, but I found that fun and a little quirky. The lift is small and maybe a bit slow, but come on, USE THE STAIRS if you have to! The rooms can be a little noisy if you're on the main road side, but I found it more of a hustle and bustle of Paris than an annoyance. I couldn't find the hotel when I got there, so the receptionist came outside to look for us...how many hotels in London would do that?!?! I said I would recommend....so there, I did it! Go.

Cost of 4 nights visiting in hotel was from 2 adults 419 euros and for our baby when arriving to the hotel we had to pay that 80 euros extra (still she slept between us in the same bed). Any services wasn't included on hotel room's price, except internet connection. The environment of the hotel was dirty and bleak, and distances to sightseeings were way too long even if we would been travelling just the two of us. There wasn't any shops near of us and only desent restaurants were two italian places on the area. The hotel interior was poor and the elevator was very very slow. Our view from the hotelroom window was backyard garpages. The carpet of the room was dirty or it looked like that, it might have been beaten-up... The professional photos taken from the hotel on booking site and everywhere are far hoax. The day when we were leaving from our hotel we asked the reception to call us a cab to the airport. We got the cab on time but the trip to airport was a complete catastrophe. The driver was very rude and intimidating by his gestures and we were late from our check-in at the airport.

(Yes 8 people). Had taken 3 rooms. 2 on triple sharing and 1 on double. Located on Boulevard Magenta is this hotel. Before I get to the rooms let me cover the location, food and service. The check in time is 2:00pm. On arriving early u will be requested to palce ur bags in the bags room till the time is up and the room is ready. The hotel is located at a 10mins walking distance from Gar de l'Est Train Station which gives it good accessibility but if u compare to main city Paris it felt a little distant. Yes the metro service is accessible and thats what we used to take but still would have preferred a Hotel more centrally located. There are no porters being a 3 star property so all the luggage carrying will have to be done by oneself. The elevator is small but alrite. In reference to the food there is the eating area in the level -1 (basement). Over there the breakfast is served every day in the morning. On weekends its from 7:00am to 11am on weekdays breakfast is served between 6:00am to 10:00am (As far I can remember). For breakfast u have the cold cuts along with scrambled egg, a lot of preserves, juices, tea, coffee and yes of course croissants. The staff was accommodating. (On us asking to carry a couple of small bottles of jam that were made available for breakfast for on road comsumption while traveling to the next city of stay they were very kind and allowed the same). Now moving onto the rooms. The rooms are small. If its a triple occupancy then there are some compromises to be made. In our room while we were 2 of us there was no place to keep 2 suitcases. What a struggle. The rooms were clean. However there definitely can be some more space atleast for bags. Also the tap water is the drinking water. Please not expect any bottles of water to be provided in the room. Overall on rooms I rate the Hotel 2.5/5. On location 3/5. On service 3.5/5 . Can certainly choose this hotel as a place to stay however i suggest a more centrally located hotel and which has a little more space to at least accommodate 2 people comfortably.

We had actually booked a deal through VoyagePrive.com that included hotel AND flights... I'd never booked a trip through a flash sale site before and didn't know the hotel or the airline but the offer was too good to refuse ($580 each!) so we just darn well booked it! I was a little nervous about what it might be like but I checked reviews of the hotel on TripAdvisor and saw that they were all quite positive, so we felt a bit more confident about our last-minute decision. (We also spent time at some other AMAZING Paris hotels - Park Hyatt Paris-Vendome, Pavillon de la Reine and Pavillon des Lettres - and while Hotel Magenta is certainly not on the same level as those, it was perfect for our needs at the time.) We arrived at CDG airport and took the train to Gare du Nord. It was just a 10min walk from there to the hotel. We had arrived super early and were crossing our fingers that by some stroke of luck our room would already be ready. Well, it was! We had booked a standard double room. We hoped that it might be two single beds pushed together to make a double, alas it was not but it wasn't a big deal. The room itself was pretty tiny but it was clean, bright and airy. There were double glass doors/windows that looked out over an interior courtyard, which got a lot of light and fresh air. The bed was comfortable, the linens were clean. The bathroom was small but clean and had a good shower. The closet had a good number of coat hangers, a mini bar, and a safe. It didn't really matter that the room was small though, we barely spent any time there as we were were up early and to bed late each day exploring the city. It was amazing to have free wifi at the hotel! They do have an iMac in the lobby for guest use but we had a laptop, an iPad, and two iPhones between us so we didn't make use of it. Included in our deal was daily breakfast, which is served in the basement. Nothing fussy or fancy, a simple but good buffet-style breakfast with bottomless baskets of fresh bread, croissants and pain au chocolat, sausages and scrambled eggs, cold meats, cheese, cereals, coffee/tea, and apple and orange juices. There is the option of having your breakfast delivered as room service but we chose to go downstairs for it. At one point we realized we needed a US power adaptor and decided to ask at the front desk before going to buy one... Good thinking because they pulled out a box of adaptors for every country you could think of. As my headline suggests, this hotel is an excellent base from which to explore Paris. Montmartre is just a 20-minute walk, and the Marais district is about the same. There are two Metro stations very close by... Jacques Bonsergent is the closest at just 2 blocks but it only has one metro line. About 7mins walk is Place de la Republique and the station there offers access to several different metro lines. Exploring the city is a must, but the neighborhood that the hotel is in is great too. Set pretty much in the heart of the 10th arrondissement, it is very close to the canal which is lined with cute bars and restaurants. We ate at one of them on our last night in town, which I actually found after a quick search on TripAdvisor, it's called Les Enfants Perdus. It had great reviews and was just a 3 minute walk from the hotel, so we decided to check it out. It was great! Quaint and cozy, yet chic. The glowing reviews that others have posted about it are spot on. The food was absolutely delicious, and not only were the waiters very helpful and gracious but they were pretty delicious-looking themselves! Check-out is at noon but we only needed to leave for the airport at 4pm, so we got ourselves packed up early and the hotel had no problem letting us store our luggage with them while we went out and about. Later we came back and grabbed our bags, changed into our outfits for the plane and relaxed in the air conditioning for about half an hour before we made the 10min walk back to Gare du Nord. We both agreed that we would stay at Hotel Magenta again.

There are four floors in the hotel and one lift. The room was lovely and clean and the bed was very comfy. We opted for the queen size bed which was a great choice. Tea and coffee making facilities were included in the room also. We had a room at the back of the hotel so it was nice and quiet. The hotel is placed on main road so not sure what the noise level would be at night but even during the day I couldnt hear the traffic whilst sitting in reception. There were \"balcony\" type doors which was nice too because we could get some fresh air instead of just turning on the air conditioning. Satelitte tv with french channels mostly and a couple of English ones too. Room service is available, wake up calls etc. A buffet breakfast and free wifi was included in our deal (we booked through expedia). Breakfast was very nice, a wide choice - eggs, sausages, rolls, croissant, pastries, cereal, juice, tea, coffee etc so something for everyone. The hotel is placed in a great location. Only a 10 minute walk from the Gare du Nord station. The nearest metro is Jacques Bonsergent (5 min walk) which made it very easy to get around.

The room had an odd configuration with two hallways within the room but the view from our room was good with two large windows that opened to a small balcony. Watch our for channel surfing on the t.v. as one channel was XXX and not appropriate for our eyes. We had a fire alarm one night around 3 a.m. The alarm woke me from a dead sleep and we took the winding staircase down four flights in our pajamas and didn't see anyone else until we got to the lobby. Two fire trucks came and did their thing, apparently a \"fuse\" blew and created a small flame. We returned to our rooms about a half hour later and had trouble going back to sleep. We all ended up sleeping in til 10:30 am, luckily we we didn't need to catch the Eurostar until 2 pm. I don't think I would stay here again just because of the district and it seemed a little rundown in this area.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cConvinient, relaxed and totally chilled out Hotel\u201d", "Author": "The_Masterplan", "ReviewID": "UR66563034", "Content": "I had never been to Paris before and when I book holidays I always find great deals...in this case I did not fail! I booked my trip includive of eurostar and hotel and paid \u00a3400 for 5 nights for 2 of us (includive of breakfast)!! I saw the individual prices inside the hotel per night and was shocked to find I had got an amazing deal!! This hotel has absolutely the best location!!! Reason I say this is due to a few reasons: 1. All the centre of Paris shops/restaurants charge higher prices for everything 2. There are 4 metro stations within 5 minutes walk of the hotel (nearest is literally 1 minute). The metro in Paris is amazing, better than the London Underground as it runs every 2 minutes and you can get to absolutely anywhere in Paris by buying a single metro ticket (\u00a31) 3. There are restaurants everywhere from expensive Indian's to McDonalds or Subway within 5 minutes walk! 4. Lots of small supermarket shops which are great for bulk buying drinks, etc and storing in the hotel fridge! 5. Hotel is absolutely silent when inside, whether a party is going on outside or its raining, you feel relaxed and at ease. In the main central hotels, you have a lot more hustle and bustle of the city The hotel also has some great features such as free wi-fi, buffet breakfast which is perfect as the croissants are amazing and all the carbohydrates you consume, can be easily burned off from walking around the city. The staff were extremely freindly, spoke great English and were always polite...I must say...French people are probably these politest people I have ever come across in Europe!!! Always offer to help and every sentence has a please and a thank you!! Along with the Hotel, i loved the main sights of course, but the shopping centre the hotel helps to promote is definitely worth a visit - Galleries Lafayette (though a lot of the things there are much more pricier than buying on Champs Elysees). This shopping centre looks like a palace from the inside!!! Beautiful. Some handy tips: 1. When using the metro for the 1st time, buy a book of 10 metro tickets (works out to \u00a31 per ticket) as opposed to a single ticket, which works out to \u00a31.60 2. Be prepared to walk a lot of steps when visiting the Arc de Triomph 3. Go to a supermarket - Lidl is round the corner to the hotel and is dirt cheap for drinks and snacks! 4. When shopping for souveniers, shop around as so many shops have the same goods all at different prices - e.g. I bought a mug for 3.90 euros, but was in another shop for 9 euros! 5. Go on the 1 hour sightseeing cruise along the river Seine at the Eiffel Tower - BUT go at night for the 10pm departing time. Seeing Paris at night is much more breath taking and when you see the Eiffel Tower light up and flash, you'll realise you made a good decision on the late cruise! 6. Wear very comfortable footwear - trainers or flip flops and when walking, be prepared to get blisters if you make the mistake of wearing the wrong footwear! I'll leave the rest of the journey for you to experience, but all in all I absolutely, fantastically loved my trip to Paris, was 1 of my most favoured trips ever!!!

Hotel Magenta is in the heart of the bustling area but once inside, you could not hear a thing outside. Modern, spotless, friendly, safe (which was really important for me travelling alone - 24 hour reception staff and surveillance) central location - everything you could possibly ask for from a hotel.

What it does mean is that it's great value. I booked this as a flight + hotel package trip through a popular website (I know that I cannot give the name here because Tripadvisor will only remove it). Pros: * It's walking distance from the Gare du Nord RER train station (about a 10 minute walk). It was even closer than we thought - so close in fact we walked well past it. I knew I was looking for a magenta-coloured hotel with flags out front. What I didn't know is that the trees on the street hide much of the hotel when approaching from the other side of the street. Also, it's pretty painless to get from the Roissy airport to Gare du Nord station by their RER commuter train, and it takes about 45 or so minutes. * The free breakfasts was a tremendous bonus, especially given the variety. It was great having pulpy orange juice and coffee every morning. They have different types of breads (including dinner rolls), chocolate croissants, cold cut meats, sausages, scrambled eggs, cereals with milk, yogurt, cheese wedges, and grape fruit juice. With the dinner rolls and cheese you can make sandwiches for lunch. The eating area is in the basement. It is surprisingly spacious and welcoming. Even when there was a lot of people, there were always enough seats. And the have flat-screen TV's mounted on the walls. * Staff/Service - I was impressed with the consistently great service. No matter who was working the desk, service was excellent. I would always have a question about directions, and front desk was always obliging. After approaching front desk about the fan in my room that did not work, she made sure it was fixed for when I got back. They were kind about lending a plug-in converter with a 10 EUR deposit. I really enjoyed their front desk candy dish, which was always filled. And they kept the breakfast eating area very clean, even when it was busy. * I've read that this hotel was renovated last year, and it shows. The lobby is quite nice, and modern. And the rooms feel somewhat new, and clean. * Other perks: having the bar fridge in the room is extremely handy. I was able to enjoy cold beer every evening (which we purchased in local markets). And it is great to have free wireless internet, with an excellent connection. * Price - take into account the cheap price, given all the above-mentioned pros, and this is a sweet deal. Again, keep your eyes open for this hotel in package trips on popular discount travel websites. We even had direct flights each way. Cons: None of my cons are significant, really. * The room was a bit small, which is expected in the older buildings of Paris. We were in room 610, and I could see from the floor plan posted on the door that there were some rooms that were even smaller. We were facing the courtyard, which is what I needed for a guaranteed good sleep. * It's true that the elevator is strange. It does not seems to work on one pick-up at a time. My wife thought that holding the button down helped (so that it would not pass your floor completely if someone else hit the button before you did). We ended up taking the stairs a few times because of its slowness. * Location - while the hotel is not in the prime tourist locations, it's close enough. For those that love to walk, it's perfect. We had a whole week in Paris, so we did not mind walking almost everywhere. With such an intricate subway system, it's still a great location for those that don't want to walk so much. The furthest attractions from this hotel are the Eiffel Tower and the Arch de Triomphe.

It certainly was not in the middle of the action, but it was conveniently close (2 min walk) to the Metro and from there, only a couple stops from the big train statons (Gare du Nord and Gare de le Est).

Also a minor word of caution, but if you arrive at the hotel early and plan on checking your luggage, they give you a luggage room key that you yourself place your bags in, which then any one could access once they have the key. I was a little wary of leaving my bags in the room but had little choice as I wasn't going to drag them around the city. Also, one really nice and rare thing (at least for me) was that they gave you the choice of having breakfast delivered to your room instead of eating in the dining room at no additional cost.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cTop Quality Hotel in all respects\u201d", "Author": "jcrichton", "ReviewID": "UR38773704", "Content": "My wife and I stayed for 4 nights in July - our second visit as we had stayed in the Magenta in November last year.

The building is a renovated Hausman building and so has some old world charm about it, however quite modern inside. The room we stayed in was clean but on the small side and the refurbishment was obviously done on the cheap side as it had a very new look but used modern shortcuts such as velcro-fixed wall hangings. Bathroom was clean and well maintained. Our room faced the courtyard (not street side) which is a plus as you don't get traffic noise. The view was ok - some distant graffiti but an interesting little insight into Paris. Beds were comfortable and clean. Lifts/elevator a bit slow and no more than two people with baggages or 4 people max. Often we found ourselves using the stairs especially when your in a rush. It also appeared to get stuck on a floor as we saw the hotel management running up the creaky old staircase a couple of times to try and resolve the problem. Getting to and from the hotel is ok but not the best - The closest major metro station is 'Republique' which is a good 5-10 min walk away and has lots of interconnecting metro lines, the station Jacques Bonsergent is closer but is a minor metro line which means you'll need to change stations unless heading to Montmatre. We walked from Gare du Nord to Hotel Magenta which is a good 15 min walk and a little tricky with wheely suitcases negotiating some major intersections. We suspect that someone may have had attempted to pickpocket us as one of our backpacks was unzipped when we arrived at the hotel. Front of House is just ok. The staff spoke english sufficiently and were able to check you in and give directions. Nothing special but meets your needs. The buffet breakfast is quite good. Selection consisting of juices, breads, ham, cheese fruit and pastries. There were also hot items such as scrambled eggs and a type of sausage. All in all the hotel was good place to stay but the 10th arrondissement and the Boulevards de Magenta has no attractions. For our whole stay the area did not feel safe, especially coming home late at night. Each night we saw homeless sleeping on the street and on a couple of occasions men urinating in the street. It seemed like the Boulevards de Magenta was just a thoroughfare to get to another district which made the surroundings a bit empty, run down, dirty and urban.

We requested for a Premium room, which came with a comfy king size bed with a fluffy feather-bed cover, a nice flat screen tv and a dvd player (but you're not there to watch tv!), and a clean and modern bathroom. At first, we were in room 303, facing Magenta Blvd, which is a bit noisy (it's fine as long as you keep the window well shut, but the AC isn't really cold so by the end of the night, you wished you could crack the window). So we requested to be transferred in a room facing the interior court, which they did as soon as there was one available. Room 508 was great, a little bigger, very quiet and with a full bathtub instead of a shower. There is a safe in the room (and in the staircase on the first floor) if you wish to leave your passport and other valuables. There's a luggage deposit (which is really useful since you can't check in before 3pm). The breakfast was nice: eggs, sausages, cereals, crescent rolls (of course!), other pastries, yogurt, bread, jam, fruit salad, 3 kinds of deli, 1 kind of cheese, orange and grapefruit juices, tea and coffee. Always replenish till the last minute, so no need to rush to get it (you can also request to have it delivered to your room). There is also a coffee/tea bar in the room. The fridge is big enough so you could keep some nice French cheese and pate for lunch. The hotel is well located, you can take the RER (suburb train for about 9 euros) from Charles-de-Gaules to the Gare du Nord (be careful there are some trains that are direct and some that stop at every station on the way) and then walk to the hotel. From the hotel, you can walk to many sites of interest, but I still advise to buy a Paris Visite pass which gives you unlimited access to subway, bus & train (zone 1 to 3 is enough if you want to stay in the hearth of Paris and don't planned to go to Versailles) and it also gives you a discount in a few museum such as the Opera Garnier and the Arc de Triomphe. There are about 5 subway lines that come near the hotel, so you can go wherever you want. The surroundings feel safe and we didn't have to leave our key at the front desk as some other reviews suggested. We enjoyed the free access to the Mac, and the entire hotel is wifi (as well as many restaurants, we noticed).

The area is a little rundown looking but this is par for the course in Paris and it's perfectly safe. Both times when I've booked I've then contacted the hotel directly asking for as big a room as possible. The first time I stayed my boyfriend and I had a lovely double room, small compared to UK hotels but large by Parisian standards! The decor is fairly modern and there's a flatscreen TV and DVD player in the rooms (tip: take some films with you if you don't want to watch French TV in the evenings). The second time I stayed I was given a room on the 7th floor, it was a hike to get to but a brilliant wee room up in the 'garrett', it had a great views out over the rooftops of Paris. Ask for a room on this floor if you want something a bit different and don't mind climbing the last flight of stairs (or more if the lift breaks down as it did when I was there!). Breakfast was included in our rate and is served in a little breakfast room in the basement. There is plenty on offer - croissants, cereal, toast, fruit, yoghurts, tea, coffee and juice - and is a help yourself affair. The staff are very friendly and speak excellent English but will also converse with you in French if you give it a go. A great feature of this hotel is that they have three or four Macs in the lobby which you can access the internet on and are free for use. There are also big comfy settees here too which you can lounge around on if you're waiting to check-in or leave for your flight. There is also a supermarket about 5 mins up the road which you can stock up on food and baguettes and cheese for your day trips, along with small boulangeries en route to the train station.

I always think a good test of any organisation is not how they cope when things are good but how they respond when there are problems. For this reason this hotel is absolutely appalling. Put on 7th floor with lift out of action for entire duration of trip. If you can cope with spiral staircase and one rickety rail for 7th flights of stairs and staff who would prefer to tell you to leave than fix a faulty TV and shower and hairdryer you'll love this place! Read all the reviews and thought like others it sounded just the place for my husbands birthday gift city break. Booked a premium room which turned out to be a pokey, dark attic room on the 7th floor (lift only goes to 6th). However told on arrival there would be no lift for entire stay. Only a spiral staircase with a single inside handrail. I found this terrifying as I do sometimes get vertigo but this was awful! Moved to room on 5th floor (still 6 flights up) TV- no reception, shower broken, all bathroom fittings insecure on wall including bath safety rail. Hairdryer shorted out after 50 seconds use, Breakfast staff unhelpful and rude. By the way breakfast finisheds at 10AM but if like us you've dealt with faulty shower, hairdryer and 6 flights of stairs and arrive later than planned at 9.45 AM don't expect any hot food left or that the staff will kindly find you some more! Reported faults with room - explained that I have to use an inhaler and 6 flights of spiral stairs not good and abruptly told by Kelly who told us that she is a just a receptionist (later told us she was the manager ?) that we can leave the hotel! No refund just go. We were made to feel like pariahs every time we requested or returned our key. There were lots of other problems with this place all could have been easily resolved with simple courtesy and a respect for paying guests but it's most definitely NOT the way Hotel Magenta likes to operate. Incidentally- the other reviewers did not mention that there is a closer metro to this hotel - Jacques Bonsergent - just 2 mins away. Probably because like us the hotel staff chose not to mention it even though we asked for the name of the nearest tube. We discovered it sadly on our last day after much unecessary walking. Also a word of warning - If a taxi driver tells you it's not worth taking you a short distance please insist or take his name and no. We were caught out this way and thought he was being kind by saying he didn't want to take our money when it was so close - we ended up walking for 20 mins with all our luggage to the hotel which would have been an 8 min cab ride. I've never written a review before as despite many travels have never felt this strongly before. I completely wasted my money and have returned feeling utterly devastated.

(come up out of jaques bonsargeant turn right and look for the flags.) The hotel is painted more aubergine than magenta and has flags of the world above the doors. It is easily the most modern facade on the street and looks clean and modern. (easily spotted too.) We couldnt check in till 3pm but there is a baggage room that they are happy to let you store your bags in until your room is ready. (we then went investigating.) The staff are very friendly and helpful and their english is much better than my french. The reception is bright and modern and there are plent y of big comfy chairs to sit in. We noticed a continual cleaning and maintenence schedule during our stay. The lift is very slow, modern but slow. The staircase is a 19th century wonder, very ornate and we got a really cool photo from bottom to top. All the walls are MAGENTA. The room itself was very good indeed. ( i had clicked premium double for an extra 30 quid.) Very clean, modern and the bedding was all clean fresh white linen. The bathroom was clean, smelled fresh and the shower was really hot and powerful. There is a hairdryer built in for those who need it. Flat screen TV and dvd player, with international cable. couple of music channels and bbc world service. mini bar with soft drinks and water. (No alcohol?) Our room (209) was facing the courtyard and was quiet and sunny.(In January!) The buffet breakfast was great, down in the basement they have converted a room into a breakfast room, again, clean modern fixtures and fittings, flat screen tvs etc. breakfast is either scrambled eggs and little saveloy type sausages or fresh fruit, yoghurt, yummy pastries, cold meats and cheeses and great fresh coffee and cream. All in all the hotel was better than we expected and great value for money through last minute dot com. I would definitely book there again and would recommend this hotel to anyone.

We travelled in on the Eurostar and had no problems finding our way to the hotel from the Gare\u2019d Nord, it\u2019s only a ten minute walk. The hotel itself is not easy to miss: flags outside the entrance and a strange purple/pink facade. Reception staff were welcoming and efficient, we took advice from previous reviews and had asked for a courtyard facing room when we booked, I\u2019d definitely recommend you do this as Boulevard Magenta is a very busy road and although I don\u2019t know for a fact it would disturb your sleep I\u2019d bet that it would. The bed was large and comfortable, bathroom was clean and the only negative would be that the room was very warm; we stayed in November and slept with the window open! Breakfast was fine although basic and could\u2019ve done with a toaster but no complaints there. We walked to several places although the Metro is very easy, depending on where you\u2019re heading you\u2019ll be better off walking to Gare\u2019d L\u2019est or Republique Metro stations which are both 5 minute walks as opposed to the one closest (turn right out of the hotel for Gare\u2019d L\u2019est and left for Republique). From Republique you are only 5 stops I think from \u201cPlace de le Concorde\u201d. There are some very nice caf\u00e9 bars and places to eat around the Canal and at Place de la Republique, we had a couple of drinks in \u201cCaf\u00e9 Pierre\u201d and if you fancy a good pizza you can get one opposite the bar at \u201cMAYA\u201d. Further a field we\u2019d also recommend \u201cLa Coupale\u201d which is a fantastic, very large and busy French restaurant (very similar to Bofinger but a little cheaper) and can be found next to \u201cVavin\u201d metro station where again you\u2019ll find some nice caf\u00e9 bars. Also we loved \u201cRoi de Pot au Feu\u201d which is down a side street (Rue Vignon I think?) nearby to \u201cHauve Camartin\u201d metro station, this place is very busy and small, we arrived at five past eight and stole the last table, were the only non-French there and had a great time dining on their very basic menu of Hot pot and simple French deserts. If you go to this bistro go hungry as the portions are massive and will fill you up until lunch the next day, also don\u2019t be put off by the queues, they queue because it\u2019s good!

We enjoyed being 'out of the centre' and feeling part of Parisian life but convenient to the main tourist places, pretty well anywhere being no more than two metro rides away.

The room was well appointed - a large bed, desk and a TV and DVD player. The bathroom was immaculate and well looked after. There was not a lot of space - it was not a room to spend a lot of time in, but then you're in Paris! The room was very quiet, opening on to a courtyard. I cannot say what a room facing the main street would be like, but it is a main thoroughfare so requesting a room at the rear may be worth it.
