This is a ways out from the French Quarter and we rode buses to and fro all over the city. We had a large king room and met great folks there that helped us get oriented to \"The Big Easy.\" Room had micro and fridge, no-smoking, lots more for $45.59 a night and double frequent stay stamps. (Our 5 night stay got us $50.00 off our next stay at any EconoLodge.) This is the way to see New Orleans. PS: Bus/Trolley fare is $.40, with free transfers. for seniors... great!! Parking in the French Quarter can be $8.00 an HOUR!

We weren't planning to spend much timehere anyhow. It's on the opposite side of the River from the French Quarter, but there is a ferrythat takes you across the Mississippi and the hotel has a van that takes you to the ferry every hour. But to be picked up, we found out you have to call in advance to let them know. We did not know this at first. The first couple times was no problem since the van came for other guests who must have known you need to call, but until we found that out, one night we sat for over2 hours for it to come, once we did call we still had to wait until the designated time. Once we learned that though it was no problem. Also, though the area the hotel is in is not the best, nor is the area where the ferry is. I did not feel totally at ease waiting for the van to get back to the hotel at night. Also, the ferry only runs until a designated time and not that late really. Maybe 10 or 10:30, not sure. Therefore if you want to stay late in the French Quarter the ferry is not a viable option. Driving and parking is out of the question. The staff at the front desk was ready to help and we were able to have them arrange one of the many swamp tours for us. The rates were extremely reasonable, but next time we come to New Orleans, we plan to stay in or nearthe French Quarter. It's worth it to pay more and just be footsteps from where the action and attractions are. You could definitely do worse in hotels, but then again you could definitely do better.", "Date": "August 23, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Econo Lodge", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d223117-Reviews-Econo_Lodge-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "Price": "$71 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4940 Chef Menteur Hwy,</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New Orleans</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">LA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">70126</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "223117", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/34/c1/34c1f84b6a1f4b893d335ab9f457c8ff3large.jpg"}}
