The hotel was clean and modern. The hotel WIFI was very good. Unfortunatley the Restaurant was closed, which was disapointing considering it is High Season, no restaurants around unless you take a taxi. Good as a business hotel, not for pleasure.

If you go to Madrid by train you can get the tube at Atocha station to Pio XII or Pinar de Chamartin. The hotel is very nice and the prices are really good for a 4 star-hotel (53 euros/night/double room). Also, the price includes an hour spa-session... though I thought that the spa was more like a big bath... and I didn't fancy sharing a bath with a guy I didn't know... Besides that, the hotel is worth it if you want to spend a weekend in Madrid.

The worst hotel I have ever stayed in! The staff are considerably rude!! They understood English and they were still rude! We also paid for a city view room and that was not what we got. We asked for twin beds and we only got one duvet. Our hairdryer ACTUALLY blew up so we had to wait for another one. When that one arrived we had to install it ourselves! the bath tab leaks, and I mean everywhere. Our beds were not even changed for the whole 3 nights we were there, all they did was tidy up, but not changed the sheets. When we left they tried to charge us for food and drinks out of the mini bar that we didnt even know our room had! it was just terrible. The restaurant didnt open until 9pm and we didnt know so when we went to the restauarant at 8pm we were told to \"come back later were busy!\" What time do you open? \"9pm it says so outside!!!\" they were just rude! When we left to go back home no one was nice enough to say goodbye to us. And do not be fooled by the free internet they offer. We got free wifi for one night only and then they cut it off for the rest of our stay. Just a waste of money staying here and never again will we be visiting this hotel!!!", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel for conferences, not located for leisure\u201d", "Author": "Chris W", "ReviewID": "UR127134736", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Nuevo recently for a work conference. It's certainly not near anything at all, not a shop, cafe or metro station within walking distance, so I'd imagine this would only be a hotel for business events. The lobby is spacious and modern, but coming from Australia I arrived the day before my European colleagues, and it was like a ghost town - it reminded me of the Fatboy Slim music video with Christopher Walken dancing around an abandoned hotel lobby! The rooms are a decent size and comfortable, although the beds are rock hard - a complaint amongst all attendees. The shower was a also a mere dribble as well, which I always find hugely disappointing (having said that, a colleague staying on another floor said his was great) Breakfast was pretty decent, with the full offering, and the lady greeting everyone each morning was so lovely and happy, made my morning each day to come to breakfast! The conference facilities were quite good, we had around 160 of us in a big room and then multiple break-out sessions, and it handled it well. The hotel staff were there every 30 mins or so with fresh coffee and pastries to keep up our stamina!

The doormen are friendly but they are the only staff who are. If you have limited Spanish, don't expect to be able to receive help - I've travelled to Madrid numerous times for business and this is the only hotel where I've found that staff cannot speak English.

The hotel is clean (the carpets are a bit worn), bathrooms spotless. The breakfast buffet was large and quite good. Options included cereals, eggs, meats, fruits, several juices, yogurt, breads, sweets, and more As I was there over a weekend I did some site seeing. The front desk staff was very helpful in arranging these tours (through trapsatur). As others mentioned this hotel is not in the heart of Madrid and a taxi ride to the center will cost about 15 Euros. It was close to my office so for my needs it was well situated. The rooms were quiet, although if someone slammed their door you could hear it. The fitness center is decent, 1 treadmill, 1 elliptical, 2 bikes and a weight machine. It officially opens at 8am, but they will open it early for you if you ask at the front desk. The only issue I had was I found my room (and the fitness center) to be a bit warm. I was there in late October so it was not hot outside, but I just could not get my room to cool down. I do like it cool so for others this may be a non-issue. The fitness center abuts the Sauna so I suspect that is why it was warm. The free in room WiFi / Internet is a nice bonus.

It's major drawback though is its isolation from local facilities, as there are no decent restaurants or bars in walking distance.

My room was simple, clean and functional. The breakfast buffet was fairly broad in selection, and having been included in the rate, I don't have a feel as to whether it was expensive or not. My booking was less than 100 euros per night, in my opinion, giving this property a very reasonable value proposition. The free internet was an added bonus, and since European hotels typically charge a fortune for this service, this was a pleasant surprise.

The hotel is situated in a very safe upper class neighborhood. The hotel itself is modern with all the amenities you would have in an American/Canadian hotel. Only a few issues if you speak Spanish like myself you will be fine, but I hear it might be difficult if you speak another language. Also be willing to walk a long way to reach the metro (15-20 min walk) and or learn to utilize the public bus system, the 107 takes you right to the Plaza de Castilla Metro stop which will lead you to all parts of the city. Make sure when describing were the hotel is located to a Taxi driver that they know its near Avenida Arturo Soria.

Admittedly we knew it was going to be far out, but the hotel website's claim of being 1km from two different Metro stations led us to believe it would be fairly reachable. Sure it's probably 1km to either station as the crow flies, but the bus took about 10 minutes so I dread to think how long walking would have taken. The hotel is situated on a new road which is basically a building site, and unknown to most Madrid taxi drivers. The windows are soundproofed to the outside motorway, but unsurprisingly they couldn't fix the view! Unfortunately the rooms were not soundproof to noise inside the hotel, I could hear my daughter just laughing all the way from the lift so I think we were probably disturbing a few others in the nearby rooms. The flatscreen tvs also have a volume limit which is probably a good thing but it's annoying when you can't hear it yourself. We were also quite surprised to see the poor state of the bathroom, considering that it was only built 18 months ago. The quality of the tilework and seal finishing was equal to something you'd see in a backwater two star place. It was also quite a contrast to the well furnished bedroom and design reception. There was also no information book in the room, and when I asked at reception they thought I was crazy for wanting to know about breakfast times, internet access, local info etc. The tv had been set up for the job but each page just had 'under construction' which was no help. Breakfast by the way was a buffet, which at 14 euros was not really worth the effort. All in all this hotel was OK, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for tourists. Taxis to the nearby business areas are just a few euros from the centre and very easy to find. My final tip - very few people in Madrid seem to speak English so if you don't know any Spanish try to learn a few basics before you go.", "Date": "June 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Nuevo Madrid", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d530471-Reviews-Hotel_Nuevo_Madrid-Madrid.html", "Price": "$60 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle de Bausa 25-27</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28033</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "530471", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a2/6e/a26e5f9b5a9c110c34a56a5baa95169d6large.jpg"}}
