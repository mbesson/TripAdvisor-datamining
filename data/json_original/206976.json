Healthy food only, I couldn't find fried eggs, bacon or sausages. In the pictures taken is visible the lack of maintenance mentioned. Cracks and moisture on bathroom ceiling, and a DIY wiring for the dryer (wich didn't work at all). There weren't enough visible wall outlets in the room.

It was great to relax in the sheltered grassy pool area by day and then catch the bus or metro into the city to enjoy the galleries and museums later. The hotel is situated just outside the city in a down-to-earth area which we quite enjoyed. We wanted somewhere quiet so we spent a little extra for a room which overlooked the swimming pool rather than the street and we think this was worth it as it was really peaceful. We loved the pool area although it was true you did have to do rush down there just before opening time to make sure you got a lounger but we don't think the hotel could or should have crammed in lots more so we didn't mind when on the odd occasion we had to use a towel. We also enjoyed the daily poolside barbecue which was tasty and cheaply priced with friendly service. We discovered that the galleries (the main reason for our stay) were free to EU citizens at certain times during evenings so each night we travelled into the city, about 20 minutes easy journey to the galleries (if you are an art fan we would recommend you indulge yourself by visiting the main museums more than once if you are able). The bus stop is just a minute's walk from the hotel. We decided mostly though to use the Metro which was five minutes away at the rather spectacular Bullring. We were amazed at how cheap and efficient transport is. You can buy a ticket for 10 journeys which you can share with other people which works out a bit cheaper than single journeys which are \u20ac1 each to anywhere in the city (did you hear that London transport???) We had a small problem with some ants in our room (not uncommon in Spain) which we notified the staff of. They couldn't be swifter or more helpful. Despite the fact it hadn't bothered us that much and that the problem had been resolved immediately the next day the manager personally apologised and offered us a free evening meal which was delicious and extremely generous.

And at under 100 Euros a night (our corporate rate is 80, but I've seen nightly rates on their website as low as 60 Euros at times), it definitely fits the bill First of all, a word on location - The NH Parque Avenidas is not close to downtown by any stretch of the imagination. So if you want to walk out and have all the sights at your feet, look elsewhere. It is near the Ventas bullfighting ring, which is a bit to the northeast of downtown at the end of Calle de Alcala. This being a residential neighborhood it's fairly quiet (especially on sundays, when surrounding shops are closed), but it has easy access to 3 metro lines (2 & 5 at Ventas and 7 at Parque Avenidas station) which will give you great, fast access to downtown, Calle Goya, el Rastro on a weekend, and the airport (though the airport ride takes a bit of metro hopping). There's a small Dia supermarket 2 blocks away, which can provide you with snacks, drinks, water, etc. so that's also a nice plus. The rooms are fairly standard, corporate decor (think Courtyard) with light wood fixtures and LCD TVs. Non-smoking rooms are on the 3rd and 7th floors, so bear that in mind. The windows can be opened (a big plus on any hotel in Europe, as they usually won't run the AC in winter and I like my room cool). If possible I'd suggest a high floor, as if you are on the street side you will hear the trash collection around 11 PM and on the opposite side you may get music noise from any parties thrown in their conference facilities (this was, I imagine, more of a seasonal inconvenience - being December and all). There's good Wi-fi coverage for a fee in all rooms (22 EUR a day, or 88 EUR for a 7 day stretch). There's also a fridge in your room that can hold a few extra items of your own without having to rearrange everything they packed in. The bathrooms are large and well appointed, with strong showers. The staff is very friendly and will be able to direct you on pretty much any question. They can call cabs to the stop in front of the hotel if there's not one there already (word of caution: rush hour will mean a long wait), or reserve one for an early ride (especially if you are going to the airport in the early morning). I only had one dispute on my bill for a charge I didn't incur, and they solved it quickly and without incident. All in all, I like staying here - it's comfy, no fuss and easy. Yes, I wish there were some more options around, but the Metro takes care of that when I get antsy. Likes: - Quiet area, close to a supermarket - Great metro access, which can take you places very quickly - Room service is fairly inexpensive - Good Wi-fi coverage - Nice surroundings if you like walking - Cleaning service passes a few times, even on weekends - they'll eventually get to you no matter how late you slept in. Some dislikes: - Few restaurants in walking distance - Taxis can be scarce at peak morning times (think 8:15 to 9:30 AM) - Restaurant is very basic, not a lot of options on room service menu - TV could use a couple more options in English for international travelers", "Date": "December 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel Good Price\u201d", "Author": "LasVegasSteve", "ReviewID": "UR8274648", "Content": "The hotel is modern and clean. The rooms are on the small side. There only 2 english TV stations and limited english pay per view. The staff was hit and miss.

They have a very limited room service menu with limited hours. I stayed for 6 days on business. The wireless internet connection is good, but there is a daily or weekly charge. The bathroom was clean and on the large side from what I have seen in Europe. The neighborhood is limited on shops and restaurants, but it was a short cab ride anywhere in the city.

We had booked the shuttle service with Aero city to get to and from the hotel. This system was very efficient and worked well and only cost 17 euros each way which was much cheaper than a taxi. The driver arrived 5 minutes early for our pickup and it was 3.30am so we were impressed by the service. Check in at the hotel was easy and all the staff were very polite and spoke good english. The room was modern with a nice spacious bathroom and all usual amenities i.e minibar, satelite TV, chocolate on your pillow each day, Free smint mints, hairdryer (which was pretty powerful for a hotel hairdryer) very good aircon system, free in room safe and all the usual smellies in the bathroom (including toothbrush, toothpaste, razor & comb) The room was cleaned daily with new towells daily and the bedding was changed every other day. The pool is perfectly adequate and cleaned daily. The area around the pool is well kept and very clean and tidy. The only downside was there was only about 10 sunbeds and over the busy weekend period you had to lay out your towel on the grass but this did not cause us a problem. There are towells provided by the pool for guest use. Drinks are served daily by the pool which were averagely priced for a hotel bar. all you had to do was ask the lifeguard and they were brought to you. We didnt eat at the hotel but the food we saw looked lovely and was reasonably priced. The hotel was a 5 minutes walk for the ventas tube station and the bullring which is amazing to see. Although out of the centre the hotel was well loceated and only 5 stops on the tube from the centre which took about 10 mins. We bought a 10 jouney ticket which you can use on seperate days. This was 6.40 euros and well worth the money. There are lots of good cafes and restaurants within a short walk. Overall i would recommend this hotel to anybody it was wonderful. I only have one very small problem with the hotel .... you cant change travellers cheques at reception and I would expect to be able to do this at a 4 star hotel. but there is a bank 1 minuite walk away so again this didnt cause a problem but could have done if i iIhadnt realised on a weekday as all banks are closed on Saturday and Sunday!. If you are looking for a modern, very clean, quiet hotel with a pool this is definately a good choice.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pinner, MIddx", "Title": "\u201cGreat base for Madrid\u201d", "Author": "JohnMacQPR", "ReviewID": "UR8236709", "Content": "I recently visited a friend who has moved back to Spain, and now resides in Madrid. Once I had arranged my visit, her brief was to find me a hotel near her apartment. And did she ever! This hotel was great despite being out of the city centre. Located in a quiet neighbourhood, with all necessary shops, banks etc within 5 minutes walk. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Parque de las Avenidas Metro stop, and a 10 minute walk from Ventas station (past the hugely impressive bullring), giving you 3 lines to get into Madrid's centre. A couple of bus lines run directly outside the hotel too, but I didn't use these and didn't catch any route numbers. If you walk down the Ventas route, you are on Calle de Alcala, a long boulevard taking you into Madrid via a multitude of shops, beautiful architecture and the magnificent Retiro Park. Well worth doing if it's not too hot!! The rooms themselves were well appointed; clean and tidy, with both opening windows and fully functioning AirCon. The TV did what it needed in just about every European language and the mini bar was well stocked and still had room for my own purchases of Coke, water etc. The bathroom was well kept too, and stocked with a selection of toiletries in case anything had been forgotten (like my toothpaste!) In fact, the whole of the hotel was very clean, and the staff were friendly at all times, despite my very broken Spanish (I'll get there in the end!!). I didn't eat in the hotel (breakfast wasn't included in my rate, and as I mentioned, my friend lives nearby), so cannot comment, but would be surprised if it fell short of the quality of everything else. I'd definitely stay here again, which is surely the best guide to a hotel being of high standards. In fact, based in this experience I'm also likely to use the NH Hoteles chain in future too. A very pleasant experience indeed! =0)", "Date": "July 26, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "NH Parque Avenidas", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d206976-Reviews-NH_Parque_Avenidas-Madrid.html", "Price": "$63 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Biarritz 2</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28028</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "206976", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/eb/80/eb8015a70cfe5616394450c45eba6e4a7large.jpg"}}
