I cannot praise the staff enough - they were efficient, friendly and very helpful. We were offered a room upgrade at check-in and although check-out is noon, because our departure flight was late in the evening, our check-out was changed to 1400. The room was lovely - very clean with attractive and comfortable furnishings, though my husband found that his feet tended to hang off the end of the bed! The bathroom was very clean and beautifully decorated. The pool on the 3rd floor was small but in a fab spot - I enjoyed floating in the cool water whilst watching the passers-by below. The hawker centre just round the corner, Tiong Bahru Market, was fantastic for trying the local food - we ate there every evening bar one. Be aware that the food kiosks close relatively early - we found that eating between 1730 and 1830 was a good time. Just a couple of minor niggles - on the one night that we ate in the hotel, we ordered various tapas dishes, and were a little disappointed that everything was just deep-fried. We also found the mini-bar prices to be on the high side. All-in-all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and heartily recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerset, UK", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "CoolArizona", "ReviewID": "UR127974430", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Nostalgia in April 2012.

I wanted to hang around in the room and I just found it uncomfortable. I did not like the breakfasts here and I tried 3 different meals and was disappointed with them.

Worst of all though is that the room had no window at all, which was another first for me. I simply couldnt stay in the room for long during waking hours, because you just felt so hemmed in. In terms of location you are in the suburbs which does provide good access to a range of local cuisine. But outside of that, there is virtually nothing surrounding the hotel. The hotel does have a small cafe but its all outside and the bar inside is very small. The service was OK and it was clear that staff do try hard, but at the same time it was all pretty basic.

That's especially true for a hotel in Singapore like the Nostalgia, adapted from an original shophouse. This is about the only downside of this great little hotel. The manager and staff are exceptionally helpful and pleasant; the food is good; the new decor is pleasingly retro-funky, and best of all, it's at the heart of Singapore's historic Art Deco Tiong Bahru suburb, built in the 1930s. The nearby Tiong Bahru market has a hawkers Food Hall where locals eat: a good meal for $3. if you want a big room and easy access to Orchard Rd for shopping, go to one of big chains. if you want to stay in the real Singapore and be charmed, stay at the Nostalgia.", "Date": "February 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essendon, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely place\u201d", "Author": "reichman", "ReviewID": "UR54625633", "Content": "We arrived at Changi Airport after midnight, and went to the Hotel reservation desk. What attracted us to the Nostalgia was the almost unbelievable 8:00PM checkout available at no extra cost. That meant we had our room for the entire day before flying out at 7:30pm, two days later. It's a 25 minute taxi ride from the airport to the Nostaglia. The taxi driver didn't know the hotel, 'cos it's only been open a few months, but he got us there no probs. Taxi fare was SG$25. Even though we were arriving past one o'clock, we got a warm welcome from the concierge, and that was the story or our stay there. Don't think I've ever stayed at a hotel where the staff are so uniformly friendly and helpful. The rooms are not huge, but very nicely appointed, with plasma TVs mounted on the wall, quiet aircon, free wifi and spacious bathrooms. There's an open-air swimming pool on the terrace on the third floor, a great bar, and a good breakfast and dinner menu available which you eat on tables outside the front door in the shade (complete with portable air conditioners - out in the open! Probably the greatest waste of energy I've ever seen). They even had bowls of fresh apples outside each lift inside the hotel for the guests, which was a nice touch. Just around the corner from the hotel is a fantastic food market. We went there on a Sunday morning to find hundreds of locals sitting at the tables, eating the food from the dozens of stalls. Lots of local and traditional fare there - seafood, pork and vegetarion rice and noodle dishes of every imaginable combination, and each prices around $SG3-4 per plate. But I'd steer clear of the pig's intestines on offer. But the hotel was great - comfortable and friendly, and an easy 15 minute walk to Chinatown, and just a 10 minute walk to the MRT station, from where you can get to just about anywhere in Singapore. Highly recommended", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Conwy, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA great little hotel.\u201d", "Author": "esorlegin", "ReviewID": "UR51779700", "Content": "Recently, we had booked to stay in The Link hotel (see my hotel review and post in the forum). Our experience was not what was expected and so we crossed the road to a new hotel - only open 2 months - Nostalgia Hotel was a GREAT find. www.hotelnostalgia.co.sg The hotel is brillient - not a cheap hotel, but not expensive. Service is excellent and the staff speak very good English and are very friendly and effecient. The rooms are clean and very nicely furnished. We had a 'balcony' room - a nice place to sit and watch the world go by. Rooms are small - but this is common in converted 'shop house' hotels. If you want a big room go and stay in one of the new (international chain) hotels An added advantage is the sun deck and small swimming pool - very pleasant in the late afternoon. The location in Tiong Bahru is very good - there is a bus stop out side with frequent busses to Tiong Bahru Plaza (for the MRT). The whole area is buzzing with food places and the hotel is only 200 meters from the Tiong Bahru market. If you prefer to be in 'real' Singapore - away from the concrete high rise hotels and tourist traps then Nostalgia Hotel is a good choice. The General Manager - James Ting goes out of his way for guests. You can e-mail James at [-] We will certainly stay here again on our next trip.", "Date": "December 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Slovakia", "Title": "\u201ctoo expensive and no service\u201d", "Author": "warmwinter75", "ReviewID": "UR51322148", "Content": "with nice expection to stay in singapore and kind of disappointment with hotel, front office and housekeeping couldn't speak in english well. food price is expensive, room rate is expensive and very small. the swimming pool is too small to swim. one good point is location for eating out. a Japanese restaurant in the opposite hotel is cheap and delicious.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Nostalgia Pte Ltd", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1546256-Reviews-Hotel_Nostalgia_Pte_Ltd-Singapore.html", "Price": "$132 - $268*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">77 Tiong Bahru Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">168727</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1546256", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/31/69/3169f6d42016e10a9c7b077eb2effa752large.jpg"}}
