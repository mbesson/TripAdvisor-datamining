Breakfast was delicious and very tasty, not expensive. The hotel is good situated, the way from the Airport takes 30 min by Metro (to terminal) and then 5 min by foot (Metro Jetton is 2 YTL). To the city center you can go by foot or by tram (same jetton - 2 YTL) - the station is not so far. You can walk between the sights. Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc Ferry Docks are a few tram stations too. There are sea buses (public transport) to the Asian side (same jetton), Golden horn (from 2 to 4 YTL) and Bosporus ferryboats (big trip to the Black Sea about one day is 26 YTL). Attention for private boats (all overrated). When you go by foot from University station direct to the sea, you will come to the district with natives (not for the tourists) with small shops, patisseries, kebab, strong tee and amazingly pub with beer (opposite is the prison).

We did several tours recommended by the hotel, it was a good way to see the city. Started with a boat tour to the Black sea and the western part of Istanbul (take a jacket with you) very relaxing, we couldn't swim as they advertised as the water was cold however we had a good time. The second day a bus tour to the historic sights loved it, we visited The Blue Mosque, Sultan Abdul Hamid Palace....indeed... in addition to several other sights.

The staircase is a spiral and not the safest. Breakfast consists of a bewildering variety of food (40 or more different items), although quality is not the best. My wife found mould on some of the dried fruit, the hot selection looked inedible, and pancakes (one of the star attractions) were not renewed after they ran out. So you need to get to breakfast early! As for the coffee .... well, Turkey is well known for its \"Turkish coffee\", but in the hotel it varied between weak and lightly coloured water. Not once did we have decent coffee in the week we stayed there. The alternative was a Nescafe machine ... horrible!! The location is good - close to the tram.

As with every hotel in Istanbul, take earplugs if you are a light sleeper \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the call to prayer probably starts before you do. The hotel pool is pretty small but provides a nice spot to cool down or rest your feet. The best thing about the pool terrace is the shimmering view of the Sea of Marmara, with a constant traffic jam that makes the streets look tame. The spa/ Turkish bath/ sauna are extra and not worth paying for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c save your money for a proper Hamam. Breakfast is plentiful with a good selection of Turkish foods such as simit (sesame seed bread rings sold at breakfast by the street sellers) and marinated Turkish white cheese (like feta). There is a large selection of salads, cold meats and egg dishes, hot foods such as sausages, scrambled and hard boiled eggs and potatoes, cereals, yogurts and fruits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c head down before 0830 to grab the best bits such as the sinful chocolate filled pancakes. During the evening the hotel restaurant has live Turkish music which is a nice accompaniment to a Turkish tea on the sofas. We used the hotel shuttle to return to airport, it was prompt and good value compared to a taxi cab. Location wise the hotel is just off Genoturk Cad., a busy street in the heart of the tailor district, surrounded by suit shops, small grocery stores and great kebab houses on Divan Yolu Cad. The Aksaray tram station is 7 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk, 1.50TL will take you to the heart of Sultanahmet. To the north is the Sezhade Mehmet Mosque (and restaurant) and the Aquaduct of Valens. Divan Yolu Cad. is a very busy shopping street which heads east to the Grand Bazaar. Take time to smoke a nagileh in the small bazaar tea garden behind the hotel. An excellent hotel in a prime location with friendly staff, good facilities and tasty breakfast - excellent value.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham England", "Title": "\u201cGreat value hotel\u201d", "Author": "cathy2sh0es", "ReviewID": "UR58888726", "Content": "Despite reading reviews on Trip Advisor which were a bit mixed - I wasn't sure what to eexpect. We got a good deal on our booking - so I didn't have very high expectations. After all, you usually get what you pay for. So I was delighted when I arrived late after a delayed flight to be met at the hotel door and have my case whisked up to my room - the entrance is on the ground floor and lugging my case up that final staircase would about have finished me off I think. Obviously, the fact that reception is on the first floor is going to cause problems for visitors with mobility problems - although there is a lift to all other floors. My room (a twin) was adequately spacious and certainly not cramped. The shower room was a good size too. There was a small (window ledge sized) balcony, fridge, safe and flat screen TV - with many international channels but sadly only BBC World News in English. (Although we spent a merry hour with the duty free vodka watching what we guessed was \"Turkey's Got Talent\"). The rooms/bathrooms and public areas were spotlessly clean. The staff were attentive, friendly and helpful - even if their english was limited, they went out of their way to help. They organised a fabulously seamfree transfer back to the airport at a seriously ungodly hour of the morning and were all really nice and polite. The breakfast, which was included in the price, was lavish - with something for every taste - a range of breads, cakes, pastries and preserves, cereal, cold buttet with meat, cheese, salad, pickles etc. And hot dishes like boiled and scrambled eggs (and also to my surprise one morning - chips!). We only ate dinner in the hotel on our last night - and although it was ok, you could get better deals and more variety eating out. There's a small bar that sells (sweet) snacks. Prices are around the same as we paid in other bars - and cheaper than some. There's free internet access in reception I didn't use it myself - but it seemed to be working and in use a lot of the time. The hotel is within reasonal walking distance of the Grand Bazaar and a few minutes walk from the tramway which can take you to all the major areas of interest. I might not stay there again as I like to try different places - but I would certainly be happy to recommend it. It's not cool , trendy or lively and the decor is a bit over the top for my taste but it's a good, solid, comfortable hotel. There's also a rooftop swimming pool and a turkish bath and spa facilities available - but I didn't try those out.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Zagreb Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1383122-Reviews-Zagreb_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$85 - $360*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Laleli Kemalpasa Mah.
