You hear all the cars screeching as they pull in and out of the lot. Restaurant choices are pretty poor unless you like doner kebabs. The owner never mentioned anything about breakfast so maybe my former Aussie neighbor who stayed here on the 10th had something special. Also, its a far walk from anything and everything unless you like to see drunks in the park, criminals in the Termini and people selling pashmina in the streets.

He said, 'I know we will never be one of the great famous hotels but we try hard to give people a nice time, a safe place, good food, clean rooms and bathrooms and we try to make people feel that they don't pay too much, it's a fair price and they are happy and they want to come back.'

Now I can confirm that I took a good decision, because I really liked this hotel. First of all, it is also very close to the main railway station. It takes 10 minutes on foot to walk from the station to the hotel which, by the way, is found in a quite side street (see attached picture). The area is safe and between the train station and the hotel there are some restaurants, snack bars, an appealing patisserie and, at least, one souvenir shop. The underground and many bus lines can be also taken in the main train station\u2019s area. The hotel occupies the ground floor and some floors of a normal apartment building which looks well maintained (see attached picture). The reception and the breakfast room, in the ground floor, are very clean and renovated. The room where I stayed together with my mother and a sister was also very clean and renovated. It was also spacious (there were 3 single beds), comfortable and pleasant (I\u2019m attaching a picture). The room had a window, air conditioning, a small fridge, a flat screen tv, 1 chair, 1 table and -in the bathroom- a hairdryer. The bathroom, by the way, was small but very clean and modern (I\u2019m attaching a picture too). The sleeping quality was very good. As I said before, the hotel\u2019s street is a side street with almost no traffic at all, so there is no noise. With reference to the staff, they were very nice and helpful (when we asked to print our boarding cards, they didn\u2019t charge anything for the service and the paper) . In the reception area they have 4 computers that guests can use for free to access internet (in our room, in the first floor, we had even wifi). Finally, as usual, let me mention that the breakfast buffet (included in the price of the room) was very satisfying. It consists of bread rolls, small packed croissants, toasts in packages, slices of cheese, slices of ham, butter, several types of jam, sponge cake, fruit cake, orange juice, pear juice, tea, coffee, milk, cereals and fruits like apples or pears.

The continental breakfast was good - great Italian coffee. Our teenagers really enjoyed being able to get on the Internet for free every day. The canyon-like streets of Rome carry sound so I would recommend earplugs (people are out and about all night). I would also recommend buying a RomaPass for free admission to two sites and unlimited transportation on the easy to use buses and subway.", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, OK location, poor breakfast.\u201d", "Author": "bellmeister", "ReviewID": "UR29444936", "Content": "At \u20ac105 per night for a double with bathroom, you will be hard pressed to find better in Rome.

It wasn't TERRIBLE, but I would recommend friends or family to seek another place, whether or not they were after hostel accommodation. Of course there are pros, but there were cons too. Perhaps we dont appreciate Rome's standard and maybe it's really low, but we just found this place to be lax. We pre-booked months in advance via the hotel on their website and were given room 110 on level 2 (a quad room for 95 euros a night if paid in cash, booked directly through the hotel) which had two bunk beds and a double (2 singles pushed together). Here are the pros and cons in no particular order... CONS - The room was clean enough, but the bathroom floor had some pubic hair - bleh. shower was really bad - about 4 water shoots, the stall was tiny and filled up after under 2 minutes. - Breakfast was REALLY crap. Even for a cheap included breakfast, there was absolutely nothing - pre packaged croissants covered in sugar, some jams, 2 types of cereal in plastic cups and some tea and coffee. We only ate in once in 4 days becuase there was just nothing there - I really felt like they could at least include some fruit or other pastries? - The place was SO noisy. Our first 2 nights, we were all woken up sooo many times through the night with yelling from fellow residents. Not the hotel's fault, but the rooms were entirely un-soundproof and we could hear people in teh corridors, coming up the stairs etc - Absolutely no view from the hotel room, but no big deal - The shower was really terrible... tiny shower stall so if youre a bigger person you would have a hard time, bottom of shower filled up after 30 seconds and didnt drain for a while - We had no hot water or heating for over 24 hours and when we told the older man on reception, he said \"sorry, cant do anything until tomorrow\" with no apology or anything... really annoyed us that their attitude was so \"who cares?\" - There are 4 computers in reception but there were only ever 2 turned on, despite a few people often waiting to use the internet. You can use 30 mins free each day, but the computers are so slow and old that if you get on Facebook or your email, it crashes half the time and just takes forever to load a page PROS - Beds were comfortable enough but it's always annoying to have 2 singles pushed together to form a \"double\". The bunk beds were not bad but the bottom one had springs coming up that stuck into my sister's back. They were also old and noisy so whenever someone turned you could hear it. - Bed sheets were relatively clean (only a few stray hairs) and comfortable enough - Room had a TV with CNN, MTV and a bunch of Italian channels, but at least enough to watch some news if that's waht you're after Staff are not really remarkable either way. Nobody offered any sort of local advice like we got in other European cities like Vienna and Prague, but they werent rude or anything. Not helpful, but no problems in particular. THe location was okay - about a 10 minute walk from Termini station which gets you anywhere, and only a few stops from Colosseum metro stop or the Trevi fountain etc. Fairly central, but not in the best part of town. We basically just left ROme wiht a bitter taste in our mouths. THe best meal we ate in 4 days were the baguettes with bresaola and mozzarella we made ourselves from supermarket stuff. Restaurant staff are surly, even when I spoke Italian - everybody wants to rip you off, the food is abysmal (we got tinned pasta sauces), house wine tasted like vinegar... plus they charge you 10% for \"service\" when service was shocking. Every tourist attraction is filled with hawkers, scam artists trying to make you buy their stuff, and tehy're REALLY aggressive. We are 27, 27, 23 and 21 and all couldnt wait to leave to Florence and Pisa. In all, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone but would also make it known that I have not stayd anywhere else in Rome and do not know the standards etc.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood rooms and price\u201d", "Author": "One-Human-World", "ReviewID": "UR21329084", "Content": "I stayed in a dorm with 3 people.
