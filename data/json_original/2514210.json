It was my mother and younger sisters first visit to the Big Apple, so I reserved two adjoining studio apartments for a party of 6 across from Macys. Upon checking in, I was informed that adjoining rooms are not guaranteed. I wasnt happy but accepted two rooms on the 20th floor, separate wings. We quickly inspected the rooms and hit the streets. My mother, daughter and I returned to our room to rest up for another exciting day. The three of us immediately became very congested, developed a headache and found it hard to breathe. To make a long story short, the next morning we discovered the bathroom was infested with mold and mildew. The shower curtain had mildew, mold and dried soap scum, the ceiling was black from mildew, the tile and tub had mildew. I immediately contacted reservations to report the rooms condition, our illness and request another room. I was told that they were completely booked and to inform the office of the room's condition. The gentleman in the office apologized and told me no other rooms were available at that time, but to come back later. I handed him the key and let him know that we were checking out of that apartment. We moved our things to the 2nd apartment and set out to enjoy our day. The 2nd apartment's bath also showed lack of cleaning, but at least we could breathe. That evening @ 6, I checked with the office and was informed that a guest had not checked in yet, therefore another room became available on the 8th floor. That bathroom also showed signs of mildew in the tub/tile and shower curtain. He offered to personally clean it, but I declined the room and the 6 of bunked in the 2nd studio for the remaining 2 nites. The following Monday, I contacted Customer Care to follow-up on my complaint and request a credit card adjustment for 2 nights. I was instructed to send an email along with a doctors notice for our illness. Fearing this issue may take sometime to resolve, if at all, I notified my credit card company of the incident and my dispute with Your Stay.
