The hotel is just a short walk from the central bus station, overlooking a small quiet canal. We were lucky enough to have room 105 which has a small balcony overlooking the canal. The room itself was newly refurbished, very large, with flat screen tv - the only English channel we found was BBC World News - tea/coffee, mini bar, safe, very comfy beds and immaculate bedding. The en suite bathroom was huge, with lovely towels and toiliteries and a door off the bathroom led to a large shower room/toilet. Breakfast was buffet style,plentiful but rather basic. The staff were absoluteluy outstanding and could not have been more helpful. A word of warning, we took the water bus from the airport, this took ages and deposited us in completely the wrong part of the city. For a fraction of the price we could have got the regular bus service, which was far quicker and stopped very near the hotel. We bought 36 hour water bus passes and visited 3 nearby islands as well as the Lido, St Mark's Sq and many other attractions - excellent value, although generally I found Venice far more expensive than Rome or Florence.

When we spoke to reception they explained that this was normal for Venice however we did not feel comfortable in room so they eventually moved us and what a difference. The room we were moved to was smaller and still dated inside but was so much cleaner and fresher. No paint coming off the walls and no damp smell!. We felt much more comfortable in this room. We enjoyed our stay here and were comfortable although compared to the other hotels we stayed in during our trip this was by far not the best but maybe thats the norm in Venice.

I paid 200 euros per night for a superior room for 31st December 2011 and 1st Jan 2012. The reception area looks lovely - just like the pictures on the website. My bedroom though, was very dark, plain beige emulsioned walls (20 years ago), with a depressing print on the wall, as the only decoration and heavy brocade curtains. It was large enough, but felt like a prison cell it was so depressing. The tiny bathroom was very dated - probabaly late 60s mottled green and white ceramic tiles. The shower was wide but not very deep. The shower mechanism was in the middle of the shower. It had a handle that pulled outwards for temperature and flow. As you turned to wash, you either pushed it off, or towards the hot or cold - giving you quite a shock. The shower head was on a bar, which kept slipping down to chest height. To have a shower,you had to huddle into a corner, but the flow and temperature once adjusted and not knocked was fine. I went down to reception before unpacking, to ask if I could have a nicer room - I was paying 200 euros a night ! I was told very firmly that this was a 500 year old Palazzo, not an American hotel, I was in a Superior room, there was nothing better. They obviously thought the hotel was perfect and I was just a miserable complainer that knew no better ! There was nothing inside the building 500 years old, and my room was definitely no older - nor newer - than the 1980s ! I was in Venice - where you do not expect good value anyway. Breakfast ! The worst I have had in any hotel in Italy. This is the first hotel, where I have not been greeted to breakfast, nor offered a coffee or Cappucino. There was an 'office' style machine, to help yourself. The coffee was not what you expect in Italy. Catering brown stuff, is the only way I can describe it. It was undrinkable. I tried the hot chocolate, but that was as bad. There were Cona carafes, but they had 'brown stuff' in as well. No selection of local breads, only some small white, soft, flavourless catering rolls. There were croissants, both filled and unfilled and some bruised and rough looking fruit. Meats ? Nothing local and certainly not from a charcuterie. A small amount of pink salami and soft ham. Nothing local, nothing superior - all supermarket produce. I left hungry and very unimpressed. I have stayed in much cheaper hotels, who have made the effort to offer a wonderful breakfast. Here, they just could not be bothered and it shows. Venice itself ? I have been going to Venice for the past 40 years. It used to be a living city. It's faded grandeur - it's charm. It was always a mecca for tourists, but maintained a nice balance. That is no longer the case. It has been cleaned up and is now 100% tourism. There are no ordinary shops. Only glitzy mardi gras masks, or cheap Swarovski crystal jewellery / paintings from the Far East that you can buy on Ebay, for a few pounds. There are some Murano / expensive china shops, but they only contain tourist souveniers. Nearer the Piazza San Marco, you have the Bond Street stores. The Doges palace and San Marks is always worth a visit, but I won't be going back. They have cleaned up the buildings and instead of painting them traditionally, with a stucco washed effect, they are now painted with modern exterior paints, so they are clean, bland and glaring - just like anywhere else. Food and drink is good and not much more expensive than the rest of Italy.

It is very easily reached from the Bus station and believe me, when you visit Venice you need a hotel very easily found because the streets are equivilent to a few maze's placed over one another and your internal compass quickly looses all meaning and cannot be relied upon! The hotel is spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. The continental breakfast buffet is huge and any emptying baskets are briskly and immediatly filled by the competent waitress. I was amused to note that the italians all took their hot drinks from the automatic, chemical filled!, dispenser and and did not partake of the two freshly prepared, continually filled, fresh filter coffee pots! We were given a room on the second floor, we did not have any view other than the opposite wall across a very small courtyard. The room was spotlessly clean and contained a king bed and a single bed and was decorated in dark, muted colours of blue and green. We received a complementary bottle of fizz, don't know why, perhaps because we had requested a double bed with a view and got neither! but it was good! Ther is even scented toilet paper! The hotel is situated on a very beautiful, quite street, there is a small bar also serving snacks immediatly next door and small shops, resturants and a bakery also near. It is nicely situated to walk into the centre, along the Grand Canal and there is yet another of the many routes to reach St. Mark's square at the end of the street. Sometime during this year, a Tourist Tax was introduced, I think it works out at 1.50 Euro per person per night (we are a couple and stayed two nights and were charged 6 euros's) and they hit you with this at check-out!

Folk have waxed lyrical about the miracle of Venice for centuries now, so there is little that I can add except to say that if it is sinking, then I'd urge everyone to make at least one trip there before it is lost forever. The Hotel Al Sole is brilliant - clean, spacious with really helpful English speaking staff which is brilliant for all lazy non second language Europeans (i.e 90% of all Brits!) We had a canal view room with a small balcony and it was definately worth booking this in advance - fantastic to wake up and watch the world go by on their boats first thing in the morning. Breakfast (as mentioned by others) was lovely with an unlimited cold buffet. Two items that the Al Sole does undersell itself on which are really good plus points ........ first is location. It's less than five minutes walk from the bus station (Piazalla Roma?) which is as far into the city as you can get by motor vehicle. After that you need to either walk, gamble with the water bus (cheap but confusing to use) or throw away all of your holiday money on a gondola ride. We could easily have booked a hotel on the other side of the city without realising it and had a nightmare getting there from the bus station. (Buses run from Marco Polo airpot very regularly to Piazalla Roma and cost just 5 euros). Second plus point is the double glazing to all hotel windows and balcony doors. Venice is suprisingly noisy so it was great to be able to close off the noise and crash out in peace and quiet at the end of a long day's exploring. Spent four days in Venice altogether, Brilliant city, lots to see and do. All restaurants are fabulous, with some great ones very close to the hotel. Only downside is that Venice must be one of the most expensive places on the planet to either visit or live, but then I guess the hanging gardens of Babylon would probably charge a few quid over the odds as well.

Well I wasn't disappointed!! We arrived in Venice and it was absolutely pouring with rain. So we arrived at the hotel at 11am wet and tired (we'd been up since 4am as we had a 6:30am flight out), wondering how our early arrival would be greeted. All I can say is, what great staff. They were so friendly and helpful and by the time we'd gone through the check-in process (which was quick and fuss free) our room was ready. We were escorted to our room by a porter who then showed up our room facilities, informed us of the contact numbers for the reception and reiterated that they were available 24 hours to help if required. The room itself if nice. Not overly big but as our trip was about having an explore of Venice, clean and comfortable was our main requirements and if definitely met this. One note to any ladies reading this review (or guys reading and reporting back to their better halves!) the hotel does provide a hairdryer.....however, its one of those that's in the bathroom, attached to a wall and to be honest would probably take several hours to actually dry long hair and forget blow-drying. So if you need/want to use a hairdryer I'd suggest taking your own. As we'd been up early on our arrival day we returned to the hotel around 10pm and thought we'd have a nightcap in the hotel bar, only to be told it was closed. I can't comment on the bar-hours as after that we used the bar next door as our night-cap venue. The window has external shutters which was quite disorientating the first morning we were there as we woke up in the pitch black but feeling wide awake. Upon checking my phone it was 8:45! So if a darkened room is a must for a good nights sleep, you can be guaranteed of that! Our board basis was bed and breakfast and breakfast is available 7:30 - 10:30. Its self service and the food provided was typical continental fayre but plenty of it, lots of fresh coffee and delicious home made croissants (I'd recommend the wholemeal and honey ones, amazing, no need for any additional jam). We were out for full days of sightseeing, but did opt to come back for a quick power nap before going out for the evening and the only observation I'd make is that if you were looking for a quiet relax/snooze then you may find the foot traffic in the corridors a bit intrusive. It may just have been that we were staying at the same time of heavy footed-door slammers but we certainly new that there was hustle and bustle in the corridors. Very minor point, but if an afternoon snooze is a must for you to enjoy your evening then take some ear-plugs just to err on the side of caution. Check-out was simple and the hotel was more than happy to look after our bags for us, whilst we made the most of our final day of exploring. I'd definitely go back to Hotel Al Sole if I returned to Venice and would most surely recommend it to friends and fellow travellers. A couple of points if you've never been to Venice: We arrived at Marco Polo Airport and took the Airport Shuttle coach to Piazalle Roma. This is good value at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 return, they run frequently and it takes about 20 minutes. Buy your ticket in the airport before you exit the terminal building. Vaporetto is a great way of getting around. We opted for the 48 hour ticket at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac28 euros, sounds a lot but great value. Validate on your first trip and that's when your 48 hours starts from. We used route 1 firstly to get our bearings, which is all stops down the grand canal (from PR to the Lido) and takes about an hour. Once you get familiar with the routes, you can use the alternate lines which are more direct and obviously take less time to get to where you want to go. One advantage of staying near Piazalle Roma is many routes stop here so we could go anywhere around the islands on the Vaporetto route and if we were tired after a days adventures and wanted an easy route home, we made our way to the nearest Vaporetto stop.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockaway, NJ", "Title": "\u201cWill stay again\u201d", "Author": "donnajzb", "ReviewID": "UR119098118", "Content": "We booked this hotel for our group of 13 touring Italy.

We had no view at all, just the back of buildings which all looked quite shabby so that was a shame and part of the wall was in need of painting or decoration. But then all of venice is in need of decoration. It's an old city filled with warmth and character. Walking through the endless maze of streets is enchanting and magical and I loved Venice so much. I would probably spend a bit more money next time on a better hotel, but all in all a fantastic break.

We were in Venice for a seven day cruise and arrived the day before - deciding to stay in a hotel closer to the cruise ship marina. Before boarding our ship we had a few hours to explore Venice and decided to have a look at our pad for our return journey, Hotel Al Sole. The walk to the hotel from Piazzale Roma was under five minutes just having to cross two bridges and walking along the canal. Located in a very peaceful part of Venice yet with all the amenities you need close by. The exterior of the hotel with its exposed brick, white stone arches and wooden shutters makes it one of the most picturesque buildings in the area. The bridge which sits at the front of the hotel makes it the ideal picture postcard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as many tourists realised. The canal at the front of the hotel is calm with not many boats. But in saying this you are never far from a gondola ride as there were two who sat just outside the hotel. After our fantastic cruise it was time to lug our baggage over the two bridges to Hotel Al Sole \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why I packed so much. As we entered the foyer with its exposed beams, polished tiled floors and beautiful antique furniture we were greeted by very attentive staff who spoke excellent English. As we had arrived too early for check-in were able to leave our bags - which were locked in their luggage room - and they ensured that we were well equipped with a map to explore Venice. To our surprise they had a complimentary water taxi to Murano every morning at 10am \u00e2\u20ac\u201c provided that there was a minimum of four willing guests - to visit the glass factory and see the glass blowing. This we took up on the following day. When we returned to the hotel we were ushered to room 105 and soon realised that we had been upgraded from a garden view to a canal view with small balcony. The room was massive, as was the bed and not to mention the bathroom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which had two of everything with the exception of a toilet. We were elated!!!! The room was outfitted with a king size bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was firm but comfortable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c closet, safe, desk with mirror, mini-bar, television \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unfortunately no English channels -, free standing lamp \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for some reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and bedside tables. The bathroom which was two in one had two sinks, a shower unit, a bathtub with shower attachment, a bidet, toilet, toiletries, hairdryer and all the towels you can ask for. The room was fully air-conditioned and also had an air fresher unit which added to the ambiance. The highlight of the room had to be the view. The French doors lead to a small balcony which overlooked the canal and street below which harnessed the evening sun. Breakfast was continental and there was lots of it. Three different types of croissants, bread rolls, cereals, yoghurts, a selection of cheeses, deli meats and boiled eggs. There was also filtered coffee and juices but my fav had to be the automated drinks machine which served everything from cappuccino to mocha. We sat in the beautiful outdoor garden with vines overhead enjoying our lovely meal and set for the day ahead. There was a small pub next to the hotel and also a restaurant close by. The walk to Rialto Bridge and San Marco is about a 45 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given the crowds you have to contend with in the narrow streets. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Hotel Al Sole and will definitely return to this true gem in Venice.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marsacala, Malta", "Title": "\u201cRomantic, clean, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "PaulMarsacala_Malta", "ReviewID": "UR117039812", "Content": "The hotel is situated about 10 minutes away by walk from Piazzale Roma.

Our room at the front of the hotel, overlooking the bridge, was spacious and comfortable, sparsely furnished and decorated maybe but this was not a negative. A good sized bathroom with shower, bath and bidet was particularly welcomed. The room had a safe, minibar and reasonable hanging space (although not many coat hangers). One thing to take note of with our room was that although on the first floor, people crossing the small bridge we overlooked were roughly at our window height and had an unrestricted view in (unless the shutters and net curtains were in use). We enjoyed breakfast in the courtyard under the vines. We accept some previous reviewer's comments that the breakfast has a restricted choice but as we were staying only three days it was not a problem for us.

This used to be a palace and is a beautiful building. the rooms are a little on the small side but fine for a short stay - you'll not want to spend much time in the hotel with all there is to see. If you depend on guides for restaurants etc don't bother - just ask the reception staff. Our best meals were in the ones they recommended - not the top rated ones from our Eyewitness Guide !! The Gondola's outside are expensive but you just have to !! Leave it to the end of your holiday though so you know Venice well enough to discuss routes with the gondolier to make sure you get the most from them. I only marked it down slightly because of the size of the rooms - but lead tobelieve this may be standard in venice, and I wasn't impressed with the continental breakfast, i felt there was very little choice. I'd go back in a heartbeat and stay here again as these weren't huge deal breakers for me. Also, if you leave the hotel and go to your left, along the street and take a right to a small square, over the bridge - there is Margaritta Square with lots of fab bars that stay open late and have an amazing atmosphere if sitting outside in the summer - its a must !", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cthis is the place to stay in venice\u201d", "Author": "brigandbob", "ReviewID": "UR81268342", "Content": "you can do the venice experience from this hotel. if you come by, air take the water taxi as the hotel is on a canal with it's own dock. expensive, 100 euros but worth it. close to the railway station and piazzale roma for bus transport to and from the airport and cruise terminal. the rooms are comfortable and clean, some with canal views. the hotel is located in a quiet part of venice (santa croce) an area with many restaurants. from here you can take a vaporetto or walk to any part of venice. do not attermpt to take heavy baggage accross the canal bridges in this area without a porter. the staff is friendly and multi lingual. the breakfast is great , a serve yourself spread with most everything. the outdoor garden in good weather is terrific. venice guides find it easy to meet you at this hotel. our selection was great. patrizia.betto@libero.it she speaks english,german and french. we will be back for our third time in the near future and will stay at al sole!", "Date": "September 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ayr UK", "Title": "\u201cFabulous location and wonderful staff\u201d", "Author": "travellingred", "ReviewID": "UR80454886", "Content": "Firstly, the hotel is in a fabulous location, on a little canal with a typical small Venetian bridge running over it. The location is home to a couple of gondolas so on looking out of our room we invariably saw them below our window. Whilst away from the tourist throngs the area was lively at all times, but never noisy. It is an easy ten minute walk from the railway station and within minutes of a number of quite good local restaurants. Also, S. Toma Vaporetto stop is also ten minutes away and that is only a few stops from S. Marco. The room, which we were upgraded to, was spotless, cleaned well every day, and had almost everything we needed. The only minor criticism would be the hand held shower in the bath which made it difficult to shower without soaking the bathroom. The size of the room was perfectly adequate. Breakfast was pretty good in the morning and we loved the little \"garden\" where we had breakfast. The jewel in the crown of this hotel would undoubtedly be the staff. They were magnificent. They were professional, friendly, and went out of their way to be helpful, particularly Linda and Luca. Thankfully we had no problems during our stay but when we needed help or advice with restaurants, bookings, or anything else, they went the extra mile with a smile. Thanks to them all. They contributed hugely to a fantastic week in Venice.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, ON", "Title": "\u201cgreat location excellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "fredangi", "ReviewID": "UR75538795", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this wonderful hotel four nights before our cruise. The location is close to everything especially to Plz. Roma. We could board the shuttle bus to the cruise terminal for free from there. From the Plz. Roma we bought a pass for the water bus and travelled to many places. The hotel staff members are friendly and polite. I requested a kettle for making tea and they were very nice and quick to provide that along with cups and tea bags. My room was very big with one king size bed and one single bed for the two of us. It was quiet and clean. The safety deposit was very useful. The breakfast buffet every morning was the same but delicious and plentiful. We are delighted to have stayed there. The only drawback is the internet service that were either very slow or simply not connectable. We paid 6 euros for the hour. During our stay the hotel lobby was being renovated. I am sure it's getting better with the update. Probably they would improve the WI FI service to perfect their wonderful service. I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again when I visit this beautiful city.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cWonderful view of canal and gondolas and close to Plaza Roma\u201d", "Author": "Cruisaholic21", "ReviewID": "UR74315118", "Content": "This hotel had been a palace and was 500 years old which really made it special.

The location is good since it is near the Plaza Roma, bus station, and train station. I would try to find it during the day because you only go over one bridge to get to it, but it might be a little hard to find since the sign was small.

The hotel has AC. The location is close to the bus and train station. Maybe about a 10 minute was to the bus station and 15 for the train. The staff was wonderful and were very helpful! We staying in a room that had a view of the Grand Canal and the garden. The staff was so wonderful that they even prepared our bed for us. We stayed in a room for three people. There was a couch and a double bed (two twin pushed together). They first showed us our room. We went to lunch and came back, they had turned the couch into a bed and removed the bed cover and separated the beds for us. This was a delightful surprise. Just a heads up for people who like softer beds, they beds were firm. It work wonderfully for my but my friends didn't quite like the firmness of my bed as I did. The bathroom was a very good size. The shower isn't entirely enclosed. There's only one plate of glass the shield water from the shower. For a small person as myself, it didn't make a mess of things. I moved as much as would normally in my own shower. But for a bigger person, this might be a problem. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They gave us map and even outlined the quickest street that would take us to St. Mark's Square.
