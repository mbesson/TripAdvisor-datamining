The location is good and they have the potential to be an ideal place to stay for business travellers. The breakfast should be scrapped as not once did we eat the pathetic offering of food in this tiny hot room. I knew to expect a small room as this seems to be the HK norm however I did not expect the room to smell of dampness and have water stains on the walls. I suspect it is a leaking building as the dampness was evident in a few places. Other negative reviews dating back several months are reponded to with messages of thanks and promises of improvements, but I could see no evidence of any. Come on Management...you might be missing out on future business by not addressing the same issues that keep being bought to your attention!

He was there on a business trip while I was there for the Summer Sale. Location of the hotel was good with the nearest MTR (Wan Chai station) about 5-8 minutes walk away, also there were many good \"tea restaurants\" located in the vicinity of the hotel. So food was definitely not a problem for us. However if you are looking for upmarket restaurants or fine dining then this location isn't for you. More traditional local eateries available here, which taste great and very cheap too. Our room came with daily breakfast but we never ventured to the breakfast area in the hotel as we rather eat out. Also with the Wan Chai station located nearby it made shopping a breeze for me, since I was moving around alone most of the time. I took the MTR everywhere, didn't need the taxi service at all except for getting to the hotel from the airport (as I arrived after midnight). Easy access to the Central, Causeway Bay areas as well as Mongkok on Kowloon island. We stayed in an iSelect room. It was very small, with little space to walk after our 2 luggages are opened on the floor. Despite the miniature size of the room, the room was kept clean all the time with free bottles of mineral water replenished daily. There was also a fridge and a microwave in the room. Fridge comes empty but it's no problem as there are a few 24 hour convenience stores around that area, so you can fill it up with whatever you wish. One thing to note is that there is minimal privacy in the bathroom area as they use frosted glass for the toilet walls and door. So if you wish to stay in the room with someone other than your spouse I recommend someone whom you are very very close.... I can't comment much on the hotel's service as we did not engage much of their services. I would highly recommend this hotel to travellers who are going to be on the move most of the time rather than relax in the hotel. The room isn't exact a picture of warmth and tranquility, but it does serve it's purpose as a rest stop after all the walking, eating and shopping in Hong Kong. The rate of the room is not too bad. We managed to book it through booking.com at quite a good rate of about SGD$160 per night. Would I stay here again?

We expected more from Regal Iclub, and this is the worst hotel experience we ever had. We stayed at the hotel from April 14-19, 2012, we paid more than $250 Canadian a night for the king bed ibusiness guest room. The purpose of our stay was that we were on our Honeymoon. Due to such a horrible experience during our stay, it left us very disappointed and ruined our honeymoon. I have personally emailed \"Regal iClub\" and informed the hotel that the purpose of our stay was for our honeymoon and I got a reply back stated that the message will be forwarded and attached to the reservation. However, upon arrival, we were not greeted or acknowledged as being on our honeymoon, no congratulations, no welcome to the hotel, nothing at all. All of the other hotels we have been to; the staff congratulated us and presented us with a free bottle of house wine, champagne, cakes, home made cookies and even a free upgrade to club suite. Needless to say, Regal iClub left us disappointed in this regard, and we will be sure not to recommend any of our friends and family to go there in the future. All of the hotels went above and beyond and made us feel special for our stay with them during our honeymoon, except Regal iClub. However, there was nothing special that they did for us. Absolutely nothing. On the very 1st day we checked in, we found a room with lots of hair on the bed sheets. That is very dirty, horrible and told me what a sloppy job Regal iClub has done cleaning the rooms. I wanted to complaint to the front desk right away, however my husband was really tired from the 16 hours flight from Canada, so we clean the hair off ourselves and went to sleep. On the 2nd day, after we returned to the hotel at night, the light bulb in the washroom was burned out, the plastic seal on the shower door was broken and we noticed a very bad sewage smell from the washroom. We asked the front desk to have it fix and the response we got was: \"ok, we will have someone fix it by tomorrow\". On the following day, before we left the hotel we once again reminded the front staff to have all of the things above to be fixed by the time we get back to the hotel. Not to our surprise, when we got back, all the things were still not fixed, and we called the front desk and informed them again. All they did was sending housekeeping in and we were told that technician will be in tomorrow, and they will have it fixed. At the same time, front desk asked the housekeeping lady to give us a bottle of air freshener to spray the washroom in order to cover the unfixed sewage smell that was coming from there. The Housekeeping lady came in and told us the following in these exact words: \"I am very busy now, I have many rooms to clean, and is very late now, I am HUNGRY, and have not eaten dinner yet so I will come back later and give you the spray bottle.\" If you were in our position, how would you feel? We are on our honeymoon, everything broke down and went wrong in this hotel, and now horrible service!!?? Is this how you treat your guests!!?? The feeling we got from this was; we paid for this expensive hotel, everything is broken in the hotel room, and no one is trying to fix anything at all. No one welcomed us, and the worst was that the housekeeping lady is saying we are bothering her and preventing her from eating her dinner??? This is just ridiculous, beyond words and there is no words that can descried how angry, upset and disappointed we were. We understand that she probably was hungry and tired, but this is not the guest fault right? Also, you do not tell your guest that you are Hungry and Tired. You can eat during your breaks, or before work. I have worked in customer service industry in many different roles, and this is not the way to treat your guests. The most unbelievable part was after the housekeeping lady gave us the air freshener, she informed us that if other guest needs it, she will have to come back and grab it from us because she only has 1 can of air freshener for the whole hotel. At that point we were completely in shock. For such a big hotel, Regal iClub only has 1 bottle of air freshener!!?? This is ridiculous and not the proper way to run a business never mind a hotel. Finally the following day we got back everything was fixed, except the horrible sewage smell still coming from the bathroom. Once again like clockwork we received another horrible experience; a note from the hotel stating there will be no water supply from 11:00pm April 18 - 6:00am April 19. This was very inconvenient not just to us but all of your guests. As we are on vacation we usually stay out late and come back around 11 pm or afterwards and because of this inconvenience from this hotel (no backup plan for this or consideration/compensation) we had to travel all the way to the other side of the city to our relatives place to take a shower. The thing is it doesn't matter if this is required by the government or not. The hotel is suppost to guarantee a good stay for the guest and not to inconvenience them as well as running water. And if something comes up there should be a backup plan and if not compensation! There should be compensation for making a guests stay so inconvenient as well as an apology. On April 19th, the day we left, to add insult to injury our horrible experience from Regal iClub; we woke up and noticed there were little blood stains everywhere on the bed sheet. We were petrified and at a lost of words. We had slept in dirty, and BLOOD stained sheets for the whole night!!!! It just sent shivers up our spine that Regal iClub does not clean and maintain their facilities properly. The fact that we slept in blood stained sheets all night is even more ridiculous. How can a hotel this big, give their guests dirty bedsheets to sleep in? In addition to having no water supply until 6:00 am, we wanted to take a shower after having seen the dirty bed sheets, we realized quickly that there was no HOT water in the shower. Once again, we informed front desk, and escalated to the supervisor on-site. It took him half an hour to have a technician to check and find out why. The result was that for some reason, something was broken and they only had hot water up to the 15th floor, and everything above was cold water. Well isn't that great, another issue with your facilities not being run and managed properly and tested after maintenance. The supervisor offered to find us a room, so we can use the washroom and take a shower. Then it took him an hour to get us a room on the 5th floor so that we could do what we were meant to do hours ago. Once again inconvenience to your guests with no compensation or consideration to the fact. When we did check out, we advised the supervisor all the complaints that we had during our horrible stay at Regal iClub. All he did was apologize, and did not attempt to do anything else to save our impression of this dreadful hotel. We then asked for the General Managers email adress, but all we got from him was the general email information inquiry email address on a tiny little piece of paper. Not even a card! Can you imagine that!? What a petty and horrible way to do business and handle customer service issues. Is there no process to file complaints? I'm sure Expedia, trip advisor and many travel forums on the Internet would love to hear my story. Ultimately we have to go online on our own and search for your email address. Our experience with your hotel is so bad that it disappointed us every single day until that day we leave and WE will always REMEMBER to stay away from Regal hotels.

Unless this is the absolute last place.\u201d", "Author": "happybutnotsosolucky", "ReviewID": "UR122929083", "Content": "When we arrived, we were astonished to see be the check-in area. It was in a mess. No greetings from the staff. Perhaps because they were busy earlier. REALLY regretted booking this 'hotel'. We felt so deceived after we saw our room. Cant tell from the photos clearly. Our friend(who never stayed here before) recommended this place because we had to go to the exhibition and convention area and I must say this place is really near. The only saving grace of that place. We booked a room with a double bed for couple but they were pretty persistent in persuading us to take a room that has two separate beds and that is supposedly bigger,we refused and they were slightly annoyed and told us, then we have to take a much smaller room since we insist on a double bed, We agreed. After checking in, we went to our room. LO AND BEHOLD, its so weird! After you enter, there is a long and narrow walkway and a sharp right to the room and it faces an old building's toilet. The old building is so close, you feel claustrophobic almost immediately(but its HKG afterall). The toilet is a weird glass structure which bath curtains are used as shields. It goes around the toilet, to provide privacy. The toilet smelled like a wet ashtray. The super king sized bed almost fills up that corner. The end of the bed is the wall. It weird why they decided to mount the tv right on top of the wall, which makes it almost impossible to watch unless you wanna risk neck problems. We requested for a change of room and was told that the room will be even smaller. Then I asked if we would change to the original room that was offered(the two bedded room one which she mentioned was bigger), her reply was,\" it's exactly the same size(layout), just with two beds\". Well..... The new matchbox sized room was fine. except that the bed was right beside the door. if they open the door by mistake, they can actually see u. :) The downside is, the floors are not carperted and its really noisy. whoever your neighbor is, really makes a difference, The noise we had to endure was bad. The guest staying in the room adjacent to ours was always opening and closing his bag, accidentally banging the wall. Opening and closing of the doors on the same floor or directly on top , can be heard very very loudly. Walls are thin(no good for light sleepers). Imagine the guest from different rooms(about 6 rooms each floor), cleaners opening and closing many times throughout the day. The doors do not come with anti slam nor fur to cushion the impact. It is really loud eventhough the guests have absolutely no intention to slam. I think the management should really look into retrofitting the doors with something to soften the impact of closing the doors. Afterall, guests stay in hotels, to rest. Amenities given are really basic. Toothbrushes, shampoo, showergel, lotion and shower cap are provided. Overall, this hotel is only worth is if you dun need to sleep well and if proximity is your only expectation. Service you get definitely doesnt match the price tag. You are really paying for the location. Surprised to read the other review which mentioned that the service is good and its \"surprisingly spacious\".

Within 3-4 min walk to the metro and you can very easily walk to C-bay or Central, or catch a tram (right in front of the hotel), or a bus on Hennessay (or on Wan Chai Rd). Our room, on the 19th floor had quite a nice view and was very nice, spacious and really spotless. The only not so good thing about the room was the floor. The floor covering is kind of a slick covering and the desk chair really slides on it. On two occasions I ended up on the floor as the chair just shots out and \u2018bam\u2019 you\u2019re on the floor. So, just be careful. What I like is that there are only four (4!) rooms per floor, so it\u2019s nice and quiet, at least from the guest, although the maids in the morning are quite loud, so you\u2019ll likely not be able to sleep very late.

Firstly, most Hotels are expensive in HK and rooms are tiny so to speak. The Hotel can be missed if you are hailing a taxi from the Airport express station in Central, or taking a direct taxi from the Airport, so lookout for the post code and building number on Johnston Road, my taxi guy drove around twice to locate the place. There are no valets or concierge for the luggage, this is more like a poorer version of the courtyard-marriots. Check-in was smooth and prior to the mandatory 12 pm check in, was allotted the room on the 5th floor (with no view, just some buildings accross), with queen bed (all non-smoking rooms here), they have a all day access lounge for tea and coffee on the same floor, with guests coming and going from morning onwards for the breakfast and the opening and closing of the lounge door is fairly disturbing, as my room was right accross. So need for that early morning alarm, as this was alarmingly loud. The room by itself, was well appointed and extremely clean, with good airconditioning and open bath, with a plasma and even an ipod -dock for music. The breakfast, was actually a cold breakfast, with milk and cereal, some croissants and juice a decent coffe-maker, skipped it after the first day, hopped accross for some Mc donalds right opposite the street, a better bet for a early morning start. While i have been visiting HK, for over 10 years now and almost regularly, i have stayed at some better hotels at a lesser room rate with fabulous facilities and location, like the Cosmopolitian in Happy valley, the Rennaissance and the Harbour Plaza Metropolis or North Point. The hotel, is close to Wanchai station and a short distance to the Times Square mall in causeway bay. Overall the hotels lacks character and the warmth, its more like a bed and breakfast in my opinion. Much better options out there, in HK.

When we arrived at HK International Airport, we looked around for transport options to get us to the hotel and found that there was an airport shuttle bus. This was a great option - cheap (105 HKD each) and convinient - we only had to wait 20mins for it. The journey took about 1.5hours, but it was a good tour of HK. When we checked into the hotel, we were lucky enough to get an upgrade to the iBusiness room. Our room was spotless, so clean, modern and spacious! The bathroom had glass walls, which my friend and I were originally a bit worried about - but it was fine because there was a curtain which completely covered the bathroom. The shower was awesome, with both a hand held and overhead rain shower head. The twin beds were big and comfy with soft pillows. The location of this hotel is excellent. There are heaps of great places to eat nearby, Wan Chai station is only a 3min walk and it connects to other popular train lines. We also walked to Times Square (took about 10-15mins) and to the Victoria Harbour/Convention Centre area (also took approx 10-15mins). I would suggest buying an Octopus card if you are planning on using trains or trams (or 7-11s) because they are really convenient, saves you having to look for change all the time and you can get a refund of whatever money you have left on your card before you leave HK. The reception staff that we encountered were great and always willing to help.

Level 5 also has computers with the internet to use for free (although the touchscreen monitors are really annoying!).

A trip to The Peak is a must. Breakfast really is as monotonous as they say it is. As Hubby and I stayed here for 4 nights I thought I'd try it on our last day... The menu was exactly how other people on here described it! One out of the two lifts would somehow be out of order for a good few hours each day.

Honestly, didn't bother us and we have a pillowtop at home so it was a change. Could hear neighbors if they were loud and especially when in hallway, but not a huge issue. Location - excellent. In Wan Chai a very short walk to the subway. Subway really gets you anywhere you want to go on HK island or in Kowloon and at least the major areas in the New Territories. Also had the trolley stop right by the hotel so gave a quick way to get down to Central. It is in a more residential area when compared to say Central or Admiralty. Great location for walking around. Food - they have an adjacent restaurant that has breakfast included with your room. Its ok. Could go there at night for dinner if you wanted, but with all the good food within blocks, no reason to. We had congee down the block most days for breakfast which was far superior. Good value for money, great location, but just basic amenities.

Nice flat screen tv infront of the bed. Love to lie & watch MTV. All this great stuff said, the service is average. It's not a full fledged hotel. Don't expect service staff to be at your beck & call constantly. Also the floors are not carpeted but tiled and doors a little thin so you can actually hear people in the hall way. Especially if they are wearing high heels, rolling their luggage along or having a loud conversation. Guess if you're someone who needs absolute peace & quiet this isn't for you.

There's nothing on the menu except toast croissant jam honey hard boiled eggs packaged cornflakes some measly ham slices yoghurt packets milk juice and canned fruit pieces. Everyday. Imagine having this for 6 days!! No change no variety. All that said, I would still select this hotel for my next business trip for the good location.
