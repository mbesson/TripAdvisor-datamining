ONE SUGGESTION the rooms allow too much light into the room making it difficult to sleep. Invest in curtains or better blinds.

Any hotel review in Napa requires you keep your perspective. Napa is one of those places where $300+ a night rooms are common. My room was about $100 (Motel 6, next door, was about $20 less). The room was small, clean, with a mini fridge and microwave. Everything worked. Beds average for comfort. Dog friendly at $25 per dog per night; empty lot on side of hotel to walk them. One of the best dog parks in California, Alston Park, is a 5 minute car ride away. Starbucks just across the street. Hot tub not used but looked very clean. On the downside, you could hear creaking with every step of the person in the room above. Old non-flat panel tv with limited channels. Room heater a bit noisy. Convenient but busy location. Would stay here again. Booking note: While waiting to check in I overheard part of a conversation regarding some kind of problem with the room/reservation with another guest. The management was responding by telling the guest they couldn't do anything about the issue since they had booked thru a third party. The \"you didn't pay us, you paid them\" line. I see this more and more these days with hotels, airlines, etc. It seems to be a technique to encourage people to book directly with the business. I am not saying the Chablis Inn is a bad guy here; I don't know the specifcs. I am just pointing out the general issue of how one books travel and how it affects you if there is a problem.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Livingston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Accomendations!\u201d", "Author": "Lorrie L", "ReviewID": "UR123024607", "Content": "I recently spent several nights at the Chablis Inn.

My girlfriend and I decide on this place as this was part of a special for http://LivingSocial.com. She purchased me a package that included a 2-night stay for two complete with a complimentary bottle of red wine and a FREE tasting at Silenus Vineyards winery. For Napa, at $125, this is a great deal and we took full advantage of this amazing offer. As this review is focused mainly on the hotel, I will give you my full experience in the time I was here. We arrive on a Friday afternoon around 4:15pm as we checked into our room. We were both very impressed with the cleanliness of the room as well as how everything was laid out. As a nice added feature, there was a mini-refrigerator as well as wet bar, coffee maker (w/complimentary coffee & hot cocoa) an iron/ironing board, hairdryer, and TV armoire complete with about 20 channels on the TV. There was also a study area and the counter tops in the wet bar area and bathroom were of a nice granite which really made this little place look quite classy. In addition, the showers produced consistent hot water and the heater/air conditioner was up to par as well. I would have to say one of the only dislikes are that the beds are a little bit on the firm side. I guess I am spoiled considering I sleep on a queen size pillowtop at home but I almost had to always sleep on my back during my 2-night stay (even though I am mainly a side sleeper). One other minor complaint that my girlfriend had was that the wi-fi internet was a tad bit on the sluggish side (which was the primary reason for deducting a star on this place). Overall, this is a great location and what really sold us on this hotel was that it was in close proximity to everything; 1 block from Starbucks as well as the freeway & shopping; 3 blocks from Highway 29 and just a hop, skip, and a jump from Target & Whole Foods. We will definitely consider coming here again when we stay in Napa.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for pet-friendly hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Susan B", "ReviewID": "UR121647446", "Content": "Went for concert near by at Uptown theater.

Breakfast is not served at the Chablis so we went into the village of Napa and ate at Gillwoods on both mornings (talk about great eggs Benedict!). The drive into downtown Napa is a little confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it's fine. We experienced a little noise outside our door around 7:30am one morning due to people packing up their car to leave, but otherwise, it was pretty quiet.

Couple blocks away are some small shopping areas and places to eat. There is a Sizzler and Applebee's not too far. We were there to do wine tasting so we didn't spend too much time at the motel.

The location is prime, and the surroundings are quiet. Two problems keep this motel from getting 5 stars. First, I have to knock off 1 star for noise from the surrounding rooms. The achilles' heel of this hotel is the motel-style door to the adjoining room. Even though you'll keep this closed and locked (unless you have kids in the next room), any noise in the next room blasts right through that door. People don't even have to be loud in order to be heard in the next room. This is quite annoying at 3 am. Second, I have to knock off one more star for the bizarre reservation system. You reserve a room like any other hotel - giving your credit card number to reserve the room, either by phone or via the web. Nevertheless, the motel will call you a couple of days before your visit and _require_ you to call back to confirm; if you don't, they'll sell your room out from under you. Be very careful if you're staying here as part of a long vacation and you're not going to be able to check (or you'll forget to check) your phone messages - you may find a nasty surprise waiting for you when you arrive.

The staff was so friendly and made dinner suggestions within walking distance of the hotel. I went with the King and was so glad I did. The rooms come with a coffee pot, small kitchen area with a sink and cupboards, a full sized ironing board, a huge bathroom with big, fluffy towels, a desk with ample outlet space to charge up a laptop and cell phone. The room had a large screen TV with HBO and cable. The room was clean, comfortable and very nicely decorated. I would say the hotel was renovated within the last year or so.
