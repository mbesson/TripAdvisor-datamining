The first impression when you enter is not very promising: the reception area is very small, the recepsionists are very busy, so you have to wait to be served but the rooms, though not as spacious as modern hotels are, are very characteristic, nicely decorated, clean and confortable.

However, that is where the rave review ends. The hotel seems to be split in two with one half overlooking the canal and Hard Rock Cafe and the shabbier half overlooking a noisy ally. We were in the latter which was accessed by going up two flights of stairs, walking over the bridge and then back down some stairs to our room. The room itself looked somewhat tired but was adequate as a crash pad and we were stuck with twin beds as the website we booked through kept throwing up a glitch when we tried to book a double. Breakfast was disappointing compared to the one we had enjoyed at a sister Best Western hotel in Milan earlier that week and I would suggest that a trip to the local bakeries etc would be a better and cheaper option. At about ten pm on our second night all of the power in our room went off. I rang reception and was assured that they would send someone to our room to take a look. Obviously no one arrived. A quick look out of the door told me that all the power on our side of the hotel was out and then the banging and shouting started as they tried in vain to fix it. By midnight we had given up hope of being told anything or offered a different room and went to bed. The power was still off when we woke up. I went to reception to ask what was happening and the receptionist just rudely told me that it would be fixed in an hour. I asked for a torch so hat could get ready but a communication problem resulted in him giving me a key to a room to use to get ready. Rather than drag all our stuff to the other side of the hotel we decided to wait an hour and have a lazy lie in. Ninety minutes later there was still o power so we decided to use the torch on my phone to light up the bathroom, but now there was no water pressure so we were forced to go and find the other room. We finally left the hotel at about eleven am and were again curtly informed that the electricity would be on in an hour. We returned that evening and the power was back but there was still very little water pressure. We checked out the following morning and informed them about the water. I was amazed when he responded by saying that we were not the first people to mention it.

I categorically tried to explain, that I specifically requested a canal view room and after a long discussion about who said what, I was given a room with the view to the canal and Hard Rock Caffe. The receptionist were trying to inform me that canal view room is at extra charge, but since there was not such an information mentioned on their web site (the fact I was desperately tried to point out) they've let me have the room I originally requested\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I 've also specified that I prefer a carpeted room, (which was a choice on the site), carpeted or wooden floor (I' ve chosen carpeted). Their idea of carpeted floor was a small rug in front of the bed, so I still don't understand why listing those choices when there's no carpeted room in the entire hotel.At list I didn't see one.I saw several rooms (all carpeted, according to them) and all of them had stained old rug, in front of the bed, with colours that had faded long ago\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Since Venice is a magnificent city, there's no time to look out for the hotel's misleading descriptions on their web site but I did have enough time to enjoy the city and also not so much enjoy the hotel.The idea of the excellent service is when you pay them first and after deal with what you are given and don't ask for more\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The hotel does not have a proper lobby, There are several chairs chaotically arranged for whomever passing by to make a short stop. And the bar is a small counter with a very limited selection.The prices you are paying to eat and drink are shocking. The decor in the room is traditional, venetian, but very tired and worn out\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6no standard of 4* hotel whatsoever. On one occasion I ve asked the maid to help me switch the post lamp in the room and she said that it has been like that for a long time, the post lamp was actually statue of a woman who was holding a chandelier, and according to the maid it was only for a decoration, but of no use at all. Why would you have a giant post lamp in the corner of the room that does not function? The towels in the bathroom were devided to a 2 bath towels and two face towels\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the face towels weren't the type of towels that everyone should think they would be, but they were towels like a serviettes ( the ones that you see in the restaurants when you have your meal). that type of fabric the face towels were made from. Perhaps it's not a big deal, I just wanted to mention it because in my experience of excessive traveling still haven't seen a face towel that resembles the tea towel. Don't even think about helping yourself with the mini bar in the room. The coca cola in the can is 4 euros.The two bedside night lamps were working on and off and by that I mean after you switch the light on they were on and off all the time\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and when you realise there's no point to have them on ( they are only distraction) the common thing to do is switching them off completely\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 In overall apart from the view and the location this hotel should never be declared as a four star. Barely 3* The receptionists were trying hard in their own way, but always made sure first they were \"calculating the euros\" before they provided a good service. Everything is extra.

Very easy to get to once you've arrived by boat, and after a long day of walking around all the winding alleys. Second, I found the staff to be friendly and attentive -- not a sniff of contempt or aggression whatsoever. (Perhaps they've had some turnover since the last reviews?)

I have to say- I am very very satisfied with my choice. Really suprised, why so much negative comments on this hotel. 1. The location is perfect! Literally 2 steps from Piazza San Marco. The people, who travel to Venice frist time have to take into account the fact, that it is very easy to get lost in Venice, a lot of small streets, and it is very hard to find the right building. I was told in one cafe that only the postman in Venice is able to find always the right adress. But there are a lot of sign with directions to San Marco Square, so it is always very easy to find the hotel.Also the stop of ferry boat is only 5 min walk from hotel 2. The room was very clean, In very nice old venetian style. In room you can find hairdryer, tv, telephone, safe for keeping documents and money, towels and small shampoos in bathroom.The bathroom was very clean. My hairdryer in room did not work, I asked to reception to change it and in 5 min my problem was solved- they brought me new hair dryer in the room.The cleaning was made everyday.As I took double standard room, i had no view from the window(it was actually the view on neigbour hotel roofs), but it was ok, because when you are in Venice- you use room only for rest and sleep.The people at the reception were always very polite and helpful. 3. The breakfast was very good, continental, cheese, ham, toasts, eggs, some bakery, yoghurts, and fresh fruits!I enjoyes pinaples and watermelons a lot. Very nice coffee. Yes, the hotel is not cheap, i payed 270 euro per night, but i am satisfied with it. Mostly you pay for great location.The Venice by itself is expensive, but it is justified- it is not financial center, it is the museum, it is like city without future, but I really believe the world will save Venice. I remember my days in Venice as the best moments of my life. It is really unique city.When you travel to Venice not the first time, you can choose hotel also in other location that is not so expensive, but you have to know the city. There is some tips for your staying in venice: 1. Surely take gondola ride!! yes, it is expensive, 100 euro per 30-40 min ride, but it is really unique experince. There are some things, that are more valuable than money...I believe smart people understand what i am talking about. I am only 28 years old, but I was really suprised when I met there some old couples( from USA), and on my question did they make gondola ride, I heard the answer-\"No way, it is too expensive!\". I know, we all different cultures and have different values, but Venice without gondola ride is not Venice, and it is expensive city, and with this price we support city and people who live in it and give to us this incredible atmosphere. 2. Again, I want to repeat, if you are first time in Venice- try to take hotel near San Marco Square, Cavaletto is perfect for that, if the price sounds ok for you. But again, I want to mention, that dont try to save money in Venice, it is unique city, and if the life gave you chance to visit it- try to feel it fully. 3. When you coming from airport to venice,take the water taxi from Piazza Le Roma, not ferry boat, taxi will bring you right to your hotel(if it is possible). It is really incredible experience, I felt myself like a princess in that moment:) (my mother was in Venice few years ago and had the same feeling from water taxi). 4. In the evening, try real venetian drinks Bellini or SpritzAperol in the cafe with tables right on Piazza San Marco, where they have live orchestra.It is also incredible show, the small candle lights of square make you feel life you are in huge living room with a lot of guests! 5.Go to Burano(dont mix with Murano) island! Very very nice and bright island with colourful houses and small really italian cozy yards! and I highly reccomend to you to stop for lunch there in the restaurant called Gatto Nero(Black Cat). Incredible cuisine!I never tried so tasty seafood in my life:)The atmosphere is really italian. 6. Visit Palazzo Ducalle, Basilico San Marco, Bienalle. And the last tip- relax, forget all the negative problems-leave all that at home, open your mind and heart to Venice, for receiving incredible emotions, for receiving something beautiful in your life.And then Venice will open it's secrets to you!", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tirana, Albania", "Title": "\u201cGreat.\u201d", "Author": "eri777", "ReviewID": "UR117124302", "Content": "Located in a very beautiful place.In the heart of Venice.Is close to the gondola service.I am very pleased by the hotel service.With a balcony on the ground floor where the moments pass very quiet and romantic.Not only the hotel but all Venice was wonderful.A spring weekend where I would like to spend evry year.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milton Keynes", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as expected but definately wouldn't recommend or go back\u201d", "Author": "Chuggie", "ReviewID": "UR116787841", "Content": "Having read the negative reviews on this hotel I was extremely nervous about staying here. We didn't choose this hotel. Before I go any further I have to explain this was a family trip and had it been our decision, we would definately not have booked this hotel. It is extremely expensive for what it is but we were only staying for 2 nights. That said, upon arrival we found the staff to be friendly and although the room wasn't ready, they did point us to the bar and we waited a short time to go to the room. We were in room 1205. The room was tired but clean and to be honest a fair size for 2 adults and a toddler. It has a wooden floor rather than the tired and dirty looking carpets that many of the other rooms had. We had both a bath and shower (over the bath) and it was clean. The aircon did work and the windows closed! We know we must have got lucky having ready some of the reviews! There are rooms literally 2 steps across the street which are in the 'new' block' and they are much better....definately worth requesting. Breakfast is very average. You can find something but the room is very cramped for the amount of people staying there. The biggest plus for this hotel is that the location is fantastic and all the sights are very easy to get too. On a side note Venice is VERY expensive and very busy. A 330ml bottle of beer ranges from 5 to 10.50 Euro's depending on where you are and everywhere is crowded. Go with a good budget and be prepared to have to 'work' your way through the city but it is worth the experience.

We were charged 300 euros a night for one of the worst rooms we have ever stayed in! We were taken to our room by the bell boy who looked more like a member of the maintenance staff, dressed in overalls and what looked like steel-toe capped boots. When he opened the door to our room which was situated on the 3rd floor directly next to the lifts I almost cried, our last night in Venice was certainly going to be a night to remember for all the wrong reasons! For 300 euro's we had a very basic double-bed 1 pillow each, no duvet, 2 side tables, a vanity table with a mirror so high up the wall you can not even see yourself when sat on the chair, a very small free standing wardrobe and a minibar with the TV on top, oh and no curtains only white drapes! You could also clearly hear every footstep from the room above and the walls between the rooms and corridors are paper-thin and you can clearly hear everything and anything going on out there. Ensuite had very bad damp, wood rot around the architraves, lime scale on the shower-head, grotty old shower curtain and an old rubber bath met. The buffet style breakfast which you pay 15 euros each for is a choice of cheese, ham, bacon, water drenched omelet, variety pack cereal, yoghurt, or toast, tea and coffee and machine orange or grapefruit juice. Do not have any drinks in the bar, there are no menus available so you do not know how much it is going to cost you untill you receive the bill, we had a G&T and a Majito which came to the total of 27 euros.

As in most European countries, you are expected to leave your room key at the front desk when going out, which we did. These keys are clearly visible and accessible to the ongoing pedestrian traffic in the lobby of the hotel. In addition, the keys to the safe are also hanging next to the room key, clearly indicating which rooms have valuables locked in the safe while the current resdients are out. After being out after midnight during an annual Venetian festival on a Saturday night, we came home to the room to find the armoire doors wide open and our safe broken. Clearly this was not how we left the room. When we reported this \"break-in\" to the desk manager, Adriano, he was eager to dismiss us. Initially he blamed the maids, and then insisted that we must have broken the safe. He reluctantly came up to the room with us to demonstrate how the armoire doors sometimes just open on their own- which they did not. We wanted to file a police report to have a written record that someone had been in our room. While we did not have anything in the safe, we were unsure at the time if anything had been removed from our suitcases and our bags. Again, Adriano insisted that if nothing had been taken from the safe, there was no reason for the police. We did not let it go, and after arguing persistently with him about calling the police, they did finally arrive. Unfortunately, they did not speak English, so Adriano was our translator. He ultimately told us we could go the police station in the morning to explain to them that our room was broken into and nothing was stolen but someone \"...touched our dresses.\" In the morning, we insisted on speaking to the General Manager, but he was conveniently off that day. With futher insistence, he was called on the telephone by one of the front desk mangers, but refused to speak with us. Regardless of whether or not something is stolen, breaking and entering is a crime, even in Italy, and the fact that Adriano and the general manager were so eager to dismiss us is appalling. Knowing that the police had been called to the hotel the previous evening should have been enough for the GM to express his concern to us, whether in person or on the telephone. There is no way to know whether this was an inside job, or how many other rooms were entered under false pretenses that night or any other night, but I would not take the chance staying there again.

When booking a hotel, I usually look the comments and this hotel was ranked as a middle class hotel but still, a 4 star hotel. My friend and I first time in Venice should have been better than that and we were a lot dissapointed by this hotel. I chose this hotel because of its location by san Marco Square which is their main avantage but location isn't service, comfort and good staff. Above all, knowing that Venice is small, a hotel in another area is not bad at all. Check in was ok. We arrived around 4.00 pm and they were a few at the reception and finally someone greeted us! Quite a nice person without a gum in his month compared to the others. He showed us the room and told us that we were in the other side of the hotel, in the renovated section. This was a comfortable room but the smell was very intense. The moisture (Venice is under water 2 times a day due to the tides) made us open the window!. Housekeeping staff did their job! They replace the trashes, the bath towels and did our bed normaly. I was really disapointed because of their staff, namely a few at the front desk. I would not like to work there at all! It is a very cold atmosphere (because certainly of their management) and answers were \"no\" al the time. Gums in their mouths and we never heard something like \" Have a nice day\" or \" How was your day?\" Nobody talked to us and that is shame...Guests in a hotel need to be visible by the staff. We stayed there 2 nights and felt invisible and not taken care of. If you booked there, I certainly not recommend you to deal with a person named Jacob, who was so so rude with us. I don't even imagine that he works in a hotel. Here is a call to Best western Management ( which I am sure as managers they will read me) , YOU need to change your staff and the quality of services provided in this hotel.

Considering this has a rating of a 4 star hotel we were not at all happy by several aspects of the hotel (given the coast of it and the rating). Firstly on arrival we were treated as a bit of an inconvenience and it was quite rushed and stressful with instructions barked at us. We were shown to our room which was in the \"annex\" (see later). It was very very small it just about fitted a bed and a desk. Also was very very dark (but we managed to operate the shutters outside the windows to get round this problem). The bathroom had mising light bulbs. On having a bath or shower (shower tiny) the water took 30 mins to drain after each person - there was clearly a problem with the drains. The fan in the bathroom was also not very effective and did not get rid of the accumalated steam (it disappeared naturally after keeping the bathroom door open for 40 mins). This probably explained the slightly musty smell in the room and bathroom. As to the \"annex\" this is a seperate part of the hotel which is in the lane opposite. The major inconvenience is having to be buzzed in each time we wanted to leave the room. On to breakfast the room is very small. If you timed your visit wrong it was really difficult to move around the room carrying plates and drinks without bumping into other people. At these times it was everyone for themselves in the scrum. Overall like most things in Venice this is a very expensive hotel that does not live up to its billing. Its location is great just off St Marks square. However location is not everything in Venice its easy to walk anywhere or get the vaperetto. Unless you can get this hotel for what you consider to be a reasonable price I wouldnt bother. Either way due to the condition of the room it is certainly not a 4 star hotel.

We chose the hotel as we were taking elderly relatives and wanted somewhere close to St Marks Square and also a hotel accessible by water taxi. Here are our thoughts: General: The hotel has a tired feel to it, think scruffy rather than faded glory. Location: This is very convenient for St Marks Square but (and it's a big but) if the square is flooded (which it often is) then you'll have to take a circuitous route to get to it which negates the purpose of staying in the hotel in the first place. Also if the tide is high then you can forget your plans of arriving / leaving by water taxi as they can't get under the bridges. We had to trek to the Rialto to get our taxi to the airport. Noisy: The rooms we stayed in were very noise transparent. Judging from the noises coming from the adjoining rooms Venice is very, very romantic.... Whilst having the Gondolas parked outside seems like a great idea, they are noisy from 7:30 onwards. Air-Con: Our rooms were hot but no air-con was available and we were told to open the windows. This introduced us to the insect population of Venice - they are a hardy lot, our plug-in mosquito killer seemed to have no effect. Also having the window open allowed us to enjoy the early morning shouts of the gondoliers into their mobile phones. Breakfast: Excellent for a two star hotel. Pity it's supposed to be four star. Front Desk: They were quick to answer any questions we asked them. If they'd actually given us the correct answers it would have helped eg. Q. \"How long will it take to get a porter and how much will it cost to carry our bags to Rialto?\" A. \"Five minutes and ten euros.\" On the day it would actually have taken 35 minutes and cost 30 euros. We carried our own bags. Overall: The staff and management were polite but know you're only staying for a short while and probably won't return.

I was more than willing to pay for assistance with our four large pieces of luggage, but the first concierge was reluctant to authorize his porter to assist - even though there were no other arriving guests at that point in time.

Between the shops there's an alley with a row of telephones. Cross the little bridge and you are at the hotel entrance. The reception staff are very helpful and when I asked for a room upgrade (I'm a Best Western Gold Crown Club member) they gave me a room overlooking the canal basin where a lot of the gondolas are stored on an evening and where all the activity begins on a morning. The guys who clean the boats arrive at about 7.30am and start getting them ready for the gondoliers who hang around, smoking and arguing with each other. It's hilarious! Anyway - ask for a canal view room when you book, it's worth it! The standard rooms are nicely decorated but small with not a great deal of room in them. Beautiful bathroom though. The staff are very quick - on a morning we'd leave the room to go for breakfast and when we came back 30 minutes later the room had been cleaned and made up. Breakfast is the usual European hotel fare with continental buffet of cheeses, meats etc, pastries, cereals, yogourts etc and some omelettes and bacon for those of us who can't resist. The hotel doesn't offer lunch or dinner but step outside the door and you have the choice of what seems like thousands of restaurants. One particularly nice feature of this hotel is that off reception there are three small balconies, great for sitting with a drink on an evening and watching the world go by. One of them is actually a tiny jetty from which the hotel staff will hail you a gondola or from which you can get collected by a fantastic water taxi to take you back to the airport in true style.

The hotel is easy to find if you are told the location and directions, but very difficult to find otherwise. Because of an error on the part of my travel agent, and due to the lack of traditional street addresses in Venice, I was able to find the hotel's location only after searching half a dozen guide books in a bookstore. A typical tourist map might not suffice. Then it was a matter of knowing that once you get inside Piazza San Marco, you step over a bridge and you are there. Facing North (away from the Grand Canal) it's the second little bridge from the far left. Getting there by vaporetto, which is a water bus, is simple and you get to see the Grand Canal on the way. If you go by water taxi, which proved to be a convenient way to depart, you just use the hotel's private dock. Since I went with a family of five, I'd think twice about taking the water bus again with all the luggage, but I didn't hear complaints from the kids. The advantage of a water taxi is that you don't need to know how to get there. But the vaporetti are cheaper, and you can get a ticket that's good for a few days. Stepping into the hotel was a relief from the hot sun, and it was nice to have the bellman there to get the luggage. Since the hotel is hundreds of years old, the architect did not consider how to get to my room by elevator. I had to take the elevator to floor 2A, go down a few steps to a hallway, and then up two full flights of steps. In many cases, a particular building in Venice might have started out as several adjacent ones, so floor plans often make little sense. I had two rooms, and they were both comfortable. They were not remarkable for a four star hotel, nor was there anything wrong with them in particular. They had the expected amenities, plus flat panel TVs, and mini bars that barely cooled things. If you want to listen to romantic Italian music, there's a switch on the wall for it. It also plays the music in the bathroom, which was also well equipped. It's perfectly suited for a romantic trip. Given the location, you will probably not spend much time inside the rooms, and being able to step in and out of Piazza San Marco is more than just a matter of having a room in the heart of the main attraction. After spending hours at one of the key attractions, it's nice to be able to step into your room, rest or freshen up, and be right back there. Aside from sleeping and showering, you'll probably want to take advantage of the included breakfast, which I thought was slightly better than typical Italian hotels of its class. It was buffet style, with no chef, but the variety was not bad.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cWatch Out\u201d", "Author": "AGCanada01", "ReviewID": "UR18784529", "Content": "We booked this hotel through a travel agent.

There are several Best Western hotels in the immediate vicinity, so you have to be specific. The hotel has all the modern conveniences, but has kept some of its old world charm.

By U.S. standards the shower was a bit tight, but it worked great and provided plenty of hot water.

The hotel tries to push an affiliated restaurant that is a few blocks away, and not the easiest to find. We looked it over during our sight-seeing and decided it was over-priced, even for Venice. There are quite a few good restaurants in the immediate neighborhood, and no need to get caught up in the hotel recommendation trap. This carries over to pushing private water taxis over the public vaporetto system. They pickup and drop off at the same spot for San Marco, with the private taxis being much more expensive.

The bathroom is pretty small. You can definatley do what you need to do, but plan on doing it alone. There is no sharing of the bathroom in this hotel because it is just to small.
