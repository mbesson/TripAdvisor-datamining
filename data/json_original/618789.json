The Hotel is located in a rundown area of the city and while close to the airport is miles away from anywhere else of interest. To say that the breakfast was disappointing would be an understatement; stale bread, terrible coffee and hot chocolate, poor selection of fruit and no yoghurt, however the restaurant food is not bad. The general level of cleanliness was poor. The swimming pool opening hours are bizaare, claiming to open from 7am-12pm and again from 6pm to 9pm, ensuring that optimum sun hours are missed.While staff were generally nice some were unable to carry out the basic task of ordering a taxi and providing information about the general area.

We couldn't believe that the money we paid would buy us such a big, spacious and nice room. Bed was also huge. But after double-checking we found that everything was in order. The roof-top pool was what you can imagine. Not the biggest, but since no one else was there during our stay that didn't matter much. The only problem was actually the magnetic key card, which we had to change twice a day. Annoying? Yes. Another quite weird thing was the overcharging for internet (both wireless and wired). Around AED70 per day is actually a third of the price of the room. We were surprised about how big and spread out Dubai is, and soon realized that the part of Deira where this hotel is doesn't really offer much. The climate is hot and walking is not really an option, so be prepared to go where you need with cabs or the brand new Dubai Metro. Breakfeast was not included in our particular booking, but we had it the last day and it was really worth it.

Also the bed was very large I thing 220 cm. The downsides are: -cleanness of the bathrooms- poor -the proximity of the airport does have its share of noise from landing/departing.

The location is crap, being located in the old town on the wrong side of the creek, on a major intersection near the airport. The road noise, 24 hour building supplies garage door being opened all night and the planes flying overhead kept us awake half the night. We didn't have a new room like some of the other reviewers mention. The cleanliness was poor, particularly in the bathroom where the tiles clearly hadn't been cleaned and there was hair left around the shower and on the floor. The bed linen had holes in it and dirty marks. I'm not sure how a 4-star hotel can get away with this. We were put in a smoking room and asked many times to be moved but nothing was done. The reception staff, whilst smiling and polite were completely incompetent. They had no knowledge of the local area and continually gave us wrong information, rather than just saying they didn't know. For example, we can confirm that you can get taxis on a Friday night and Nasser Square certainly isn't a shopping destination that anybody would want to be dropped off in. The hotel's pool was like swimming in a hot bath on the roof. On a positive note, the hotel's restaurants whilst empty most of the time, did have good food.

As a summary- you receive a drink upon arrival with sweets for the kids, friendly service, a lovely modern room and huge king size bed. The pool was a great relief! However, there is frequent traffic noise and planes overhead which may keep some people awake if they are not used to it. Another problem we encountered was that whilst they may smile and be polite you may not get what you were expecting. For instance the child bed was not set up yet and they needed reminding after we got to our room. Secondly, we asked for an earlier breakfast, were promised one and no-one knew anything the next day. Thirdly, we booked a shuttle to the airport which was complimentary, however, we had to wait 30 minutes for it to leave which made us late and we nearly missed the plane! On a positive note, we found a terrific place for an early dinner at 5pm. Turn left as you leave the hotel, walk about 100 metres and you will find Tahera Restaurant.

We were quickly shown to our room which was massive(it was a suite even though we didn't book one but I caught a glimpse of the inside of the other rooms and they were very large aswell). The whole hotel is very clean with daily maid service and all the staff very friendly and helpful. We had the pool(which is a little small) almost completley to ourselves most days. Taxi's are cheap and even out to the beach park only cost about 15DH the location is good but just that little bit off central that there isn't noise keeping you awake. The only faults with this hotel is its breakfast buffet which is lovely but not very varied day to day so by the end of our stay we were bored of it. Like many places in dubai there is building work in the streets but near the lotus it is only very minor compared to some work we saw and didn't disturb us one bit.
