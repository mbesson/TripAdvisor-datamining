That is true ... they tried their best and it was okay ( not high class, but equipped with new stuff and in a nice way ). BUT the work on the restaurant was still going on .. it was so noisy that during the day it was better not to stay there. They are building a new restaurant in the courtyard of the hotel ... if this is a good idea the future has to show, maybe it will be very noisy in the night. Our room was dark, but very spacious. It had a small kitchen and that was great. The hotel staff was friendly. I think the hotel might become better when all the work is finished. But the situation of the rooms ( many are quite dark ) might not change; so my advice is to ask for details before you book a room. I gave a low rating because the price is too high for what you get. We had shortly before another hotel in Mexico City ( center ) for less then half the price. Roma is a more costly district in Mexico City because it is \"in\" , but still the price was too high.

The location was great - not exactly in the heart of the city but as Mexico City is so spread out everything was easily accessible walking or via metro. The Square the hotel overlooks is great too, nice for an evening stroll with an icecream from the shop downstairs. The rooms were spacious with kitchenette but the bathroom was tiny, no matter though, the shower had excellent pressure and it was clean.. but our room turned out to have a mouse in it, that lived in the bathroom, and pinched the toilet paper from the bin each night.. once we figured out what was happening we left the light on all night and it didnt bother us again. We told the staff in the lobby on the last night and they offered to switch rooms but as we were checking out early the next morning we opted not to. The staff i think have probably been alerted to this mouse's antics before, they didnt do a very good job of acting surprised, but this could have been the language barrier.. although my spanish is pretty good. I have read in other reviews this hotel has had bed bugs, we did not experience this. For the price (super-discounted online rate of $49usd/night) we are not complaining.

I always request an upper-floor room overlooking the pretty Plaza Luis Cabrera, where I can nap in the hammock to the ambient sounds of the kids in the plaza kicking a soccer ball around. The hotel's rates are great and, when you get right down to it, I'm not in Mexico City for the hotel -- I want to be close to the part of the city I like. So, I put up with the shabbiness and occasionally rude service at Casa de la Condesa and I have a great time.

My wife and I like to play the game of trying to find the best small hotel in whatever country/city we are visiting. This one was recommended via TripAdvisor, and I, in fact, stayed here a year ago. Then I had to ask to change my room because things like the shower and air conditioner just didn't work. This time, because I had to make some quick reservations, I re-booked this joint. The neighborhood is quite fun and convenient to some places we wanted to visit. Because I was traveling with my wife, I figured I would spring for the extra 10 bucks and go for a suite. OK, I was fooled the second time, shame on me. *) Ever booked a suite with basically no furniture? The supposed living room had a breakfast bar with two plates, cups, spoons and forks. Those were the total supplies in the so-called kitchen, save for a micro-wave which may have worked. The \"furniture\" consisted of a small kitchen table with two 1950s-style kitchen chairs. Total. *) There was a large window looking into the central court, but it was covered with a curtain that couldn't be opened. *) The queen-sized bed was actually two singles pushed together. That's OK, but there was only one small lamp beside the bed and a king-ugly, tall floor lamp that only pointed to the ceiling. Basically, no good for reading. *) The TV only received 12-15 channels, all on the upper end of the system so we got a full dose of home shopping channels and second-rate, English-language movies. The closest thing to news -- in any language -- was ESPN Sports. *) Bathroom. Yeah, to find any old Mexico City building with decent water flow is a mission for De Soto. In spite of that, the owners could at least invest $6-7 bucks in a real shower head, one that isn't clogged by mineral build-up and literally sings. Equally stupid, there are florescent lights in a dropped plastic ceiling, but those lights are not over the mirror, which makes such exotic acts as shaving or applying make-up truly a shot in the dark. There were two, large bath towels (maybe the best thing about the room), but no hand towels or wash clothes. For the first day, there was no bath mat for the all-tile floor. *) Living in a jungle. Mexico City's climate is conducive to plant growth. Vines were crawling up the inner court walls so much that they were hanging into the walkways. \"So what?\" you say? How about vines with thorns. *) Check-out time? Couldn't the owners invest in a new ribbon -- or re-ink the old one -- for the printer so clients can read the bill upon checkhout. All in all, the $90 per night charge (plus the charge for the so-called breakfast) is a true rip-off. I suspect this hotel might be owned by the kind of person or corporation who refuses to invest in the property to drive down the overhead and pump up the profits to get the books ready to show potential buyers.

The neighborhoord where it is located (Colonia Roma Sur) is a pretty bohemian place and so are the shops around the area.", "Date": "October 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cGreat for the budget traveler\u201d", "Author": "gregntommy", "ReviewID": "UR8619469", "Content": "I speak fluent Spanish so I do not know if the staff speaks English. This hotel is for the budget traveler only. If the hotel had not been prepaid through Tavelocity, I would have changed locations. The staff was very nice and the rooms were clean. The hotel did not have any parking but I made friends with the doorman of the apartment building next door and he watched my rental car every evening for a tip. It was a little warm when we arrived and I found out that there is no air conditioning. There was a unit installed in the room that looked brand new but the front desk explained that they were being installed but had not yet been wired for electricity. The staff kindly brought us a fan. Upon arrival there were no more standard rooms available so we were upgraded to a Jr. Suite for free. The bathroom was tiny and getting the door closed in the shower required some agility. The room had a double bed and a small eating area with microwave and mini-fridge. There is no hot water in the evenings so plan on showering early. There is very little water pressure as well. The hotel is on a plaza with a nice large fountain in the middle. While we were there a commercial was being filmed for a bank in the square. There is a great gelato place on the first floor of the hotel with tables and chairs on the sidewalk where we watched the commercial being filmed. We did not try the hotel caf\u00c3\u00a9 but had delicious coffee there every morning that we took back to our room. We stayed in room number 501 and it was very quiet. We even slept with the windows open and heard very little noise. I am sure there are other budget hotels with air and hot water but the location was perfect and the staff were very friendly.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami", "Title": "\u201cPerfect hotel\u201d", "Author": "44ase", "ReviewID": "UR8518744", "Content": "Unless you're looking for a fancy hotel, you should stay at Casa de la Condesa: perfect location (close to bars, turisbus, metro etc), very friendly staff, very good bedrooms (clean, new furniture)... some downsides (small, though): the hotel taxis are much more expensive than the town taxis, the TV has not much channel options, noone to carry your luggage... that's all... stay in Casa de la Condesa.", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cFantastic stay at the Condesa!\u201d", "Author": "s0lender", "ReviewID": "UR8377974", "Content": "I stayed in one of the standard rooms (i.e. no kitchenette) for 3 nights. The room was small, but very clean. I was on the 4th floor, facing in toward the hallway. My room was extremely quiet which was the thing I appreciated most. The hotel is in a great location, in a plaza facing a garden with a fountain. There isn't alot of noise or traffic on the street. The restaurant in the hotel was quite good (and cheap!) and the whole staff is extremely friendly. I ate breakfast at the hotel every morning. There is also a great panini restaurant just a few doors down. The rooms have wifi and there is also an internet cafe really close by. Slight drawbacks: The water pressure in my shower was very very weak. At one point it was just a little dribble! I didn't bother complaining though, since I was only there a few nights. One day I asked for an iron, which was promptly brought to my room, but there was no ironing board! The 2 subway stops are not super close... about a 7-10 minute walk to either one. If it's not raining, this doesn't really matter. My room was a little bit stuffy as there was only a small window in the bathroom, and no overhead fan above the bed. Again, I probably could have asked for a portable fan, but I wasn't really bothered since the temperature at night went down to around 12 degrees (Celsius) and I was fine.", "Date": "August 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Laurderdale", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel !\u201d", "Author": "Ginaaa", "ReviewID": "UR8193585", "Content": "My stay at this hotel was great ! \"Thank you\", to all the employees of this hotel.

The staff was extremely accomadating with directions on where to get a bottle of wine, ribbon for my wedding gifts, a pharmacy to pick up those neccesaries ( lost luggage, found and delivered on day two) The hotel has two patio areas to catch some rays, read and relax which we did while waiting for our luggage to arrive, the rooms are a little thread bare and in need of a decorator but clean and comfortable with daily maid service. Two things missing that almost all hotels have in rooms, a coffee maker and hair dryers. Oh, and I should mention the WORST pillows, nothing to them. With the restaurant downstairs it's easy enough to get coffee.The hotel has 4standard rooms and 27 suites with a little kitchenette ( fridge & microwave, silver plates and glasses & cups for two) When booking with Expedia I just assumed we'd get a suite as there were 3 of us traveling, nope we got a standard room. Made a deal with management, instead of paying the extra $30 a night for the larger suite we only stayed 4 nights, as we had booked for the week with a good price with air included, but weren't going to be there for the weekend anyways. So for us it worked out fine.The turibus, with a stop a block away at Casa Lamm is fantastic way to view the city. Taxi's are so inexpensive the Casa de la Condesa is a quick taxi ride out to the Reforma, to the zocalo, or the park. A random thing hapened on the tuirbus, at the autotorium a film crew got on with a bunch of actors, a makeup lady ,lighting people and a segment of Amor sin Limites (a mexican soap opera on channel 2) was filmed on our bus on the upper deck where we were seated, how cool is that! I've decided that Mexico City has more statues and monuments than all of the US's cities combined.
