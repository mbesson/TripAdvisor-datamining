I had seen better in third world countries! Apartments are old, dirty and dated, I had stayed in their \"refurbished\" apartments but they were done so cheaply it already looks dated and very dirty! It also smells!!! Do yourself a favour and stay well away! There are a few apartments in the area that is far better, a bit more expensive but it will not ruin your trip. There are also no fire and safety instructions you normally find in short term stay accommodation. Lift/Elevator is tiny and often broken. Extremely poor! Don't waste your money and go somewhere else.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cThe Pictures what you see on the website is Executive flat pictures not the Standard pictures, please don\u2019t get confused\u201d", "Author": "laserklasse", "ReviewID": "UR115655000", "Content": "Hi There, I saw the review earlier about flat pictures what you see on the website is different from actual flat itself\u2026.. I like to say even I thought the same but when I went to this apartment then I ask the same thing, then they told me the pictures what you see on the website is executive flat pictures (high rate) but not the standard flat pictures....Then I realise the gentleman who write review he might have book standard flat but he was expecting executive flat what he saw pictures on the website.....Anyway as I book executive flat for my trip and I did enjoyed my stay with same flat pictures what I saw on the website with great location and great service.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cValue for the Money with great service\u201d", "Author": "rajesh099", "ReviewID": "UR89813398", "Content": "We went for holiday for one week, this place recommended by my friend it\u2019s a nice place with very good location and nice staff.
