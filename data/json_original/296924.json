I dint want an expensive one as i was only staying for 2 days. I was a bit doubtful about how it would turn out because of the mixed reviews from previous guests. It ended up to be much better than what I expected. The airport is about 10-15 mins away. The only negetive about the location is that it's around 15 mins from the centre. You can take a bus right in front of the hotel and the metro station is a 5 min walk away. The hotel is extremely clean and the rooms are spacious and well-kept. The buffet breakfast served was great, had a lot of variety and it only costs 5 euros. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There aren't many people working in the hotel but they seem to manage it well.

We arrived at the hotel before our check in time but were told that we could check in since the room was ready. The room was perfect for the two of us and also had a balcony which was really nice. The balcony was basic but we had no idea we would be getting one in the first place. Diego helped us most of the time we were there and also made sure to call a taxi for us to get to the airport in the morning. It cost us \u20ac21 to get to Barajas airport and the taxi driver was waiting for us in the lobby (we were even early). Also there is free internet which was easy to access. The only things I didn't like was the guy who worked in the dining area. He may have been the only one doing the whole thing (making the food, taking orders, serving, & cleaning up) but he was a bit short and nasty to us. Also, the metro wasn't too far, but it would have been nice if it were closer. Maybe took about 10-15 minutes. The hotel is very modern and clean.

The property seems pretty new, 4-*** and well maintained. It also appears to market small conference meetings also. As the final test of any hotel--it gave an excellent night's sleep with quiet rooms and comfortable beds -- just what I needed before my next day's 30-hour odyssey to reach the west coast of the US !. One problem with Madrid's airport district is the pretty fair distance from the city center. Taxi fare will be about 20 to 25 euros to get to many \"airport hotels\" like this one (a metro is possible with one transfer stop in between which could be inconvenient if you're hauling major luggage). One way to save is on trips to the airport if you could find other guests going there too and split the cab fare with them. The complementary Wi-Fi was fine which was a help and the price (relatively speaking for Madrid) was a good offer via www.hotels.com The BEST thing about my stay was the incredible guest service given by Ms. Cinta Correa Castano, Reception Manager. She very efficiently recovered a wrist watch I forgot in my room in an anxious rush to get to the airport. When I realized my error and called from my departure gate before boarding the staff swept my room, found my watch--and then she arranged to get it to my Spanish residence within 24 hours via mensenger service. The watch has high sentimental value and would be hard to buy again---and she treated my concern like her own in coming to my assistance.

I got this as a result of Priceline and I was freaked out when I looked at its location and more freaked when I tried to find one cold December evening. The walk from the Suanzes Metro stop was dicey to say the least in that it was a brisk fifteen minute walk to the metro station on the number 5 line. When I finaly arrived, I was pleased that the huge bunker of a hotel had large rooms and a super duper large bathroom. The staff is really competent and not only that, they are down to earth yet very professional. The walk to the metro was ususally long, past showrooms and a gas station BUT I soon learned another way. If one gets off the metro at Ciudad Lineal and waits for the 105 bus which runs on Julian Camarillo, one can skip the walk altogether and arrive after the bus makes a left turn on San Romualdo. The breakfasts in the restaurant are a great deal on the weekends if they are having a special discount. Otherwise, the food is just alright. The free and very swift wifi is a great feature in the hotel that other properties, even those which are more pricey would be wise to emulate. When weeks later I was stuck without wifi because another nearby hotel had no connection to the internet ( right? ) the staff here was nice enough to remember me and let me use the two free pcs in the lobby. Very nice. The only drawback besides the remoteness is the lack of a gym. the building is huge thing and though there is parking, no gym? I guess they are hoping people will walk to the metro. Nearby there is a park to run but I did not try it. I would later try another Confortel in the Madrid area and was disappointed after staying at the Confortel Alcala Norte. The rooms are huge for Madrid and I think that one could do worse by booking a hotel in Madrid, centrally located or not, and not giving the Confortel Alcala a chance.

It is a good 10-15 minute walk to the nearest metro (Suanzes), but it\u2019s easy to find, feels reasonably safe at night (it\u2019s a commercial area, well-lit and fairly quiet), and the connections are good. We had to take a taxi to the airport (booked by the hotel) as our flight was early in the morning \u2013 the journey took about ten minutes (but allow 15 \u2013 you might not get the Alonso-style driver we had!) and cost just under 20 euros (seems quite a lot but you have to pay an airport surcharge for some reason). NB: it may not be as close to the airport as some hotels, but beware, stay too close to the airport and apparently you may have trouble finding a taxi driver who is interested in taking you such a short distance. The hotel itself is very modern and has good soundproofing, and even the standard rooms have a minibar (small chiller with soft drinks and beer, included in room price and replenished daily!) and WiFi, along with satellite TV, air conditioning (quiet and effective), large bathrooms with good showers and comfortable beds (plus a choice of pillows, according to the Confortel leaflet). For those without laptops (it\u2019s primarily a business-orientated hotel \u2013 no real leisure amenities), there are two internet terminals near the lobby (no charge). We found the staff to be friendly, and we just had two fairly trivial causes for complaint - a blown lightbulb that wasn\u2019t replaced (even when we left it out \u2013 it was just taken away!) and the wake-up call being a bit late (but only 5 mins. or so). Breakfast (if not included in your room rate) costs 15 euros, and I think they serve other meals too, but we chose to eat elsewhere.
