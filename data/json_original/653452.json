We had requested twin beds and even called Expedia who confirmed a Superior Room with twin beds but got one with a small double bed. Of course the staff were least bothered to change the room for us.

Hotel is close to the subway station which connects to the other rail-ways, ferry lines and public transportation. They have professional and helpful stuff, nice breakfast and a nice restaurant which turns to a night club later. Lush Hotel has a unique character in decoration, every room has a different atmosphere. We have stayed in rooms 112, 301 and 305 and surely will taste the other rooms one by one. Don't care about the complaints about check out time in this site because the stuff is very respectful and they try to help you all the time and every hotel has a check out time.

It is also very clean, safe and without question it is worth for the money. Because the prices are reasonable for a hotel in this quality with one of the best location.

Also, we asked for our room to be at the top of the hotel, in order to have some distance from street level noise. There, on the top/5th floor the rooms are smaller and the ceiling won't be as high, but we thought our room was still spacious enough with clean, modern features and comfort. The rooms on the floors below are significantly larger and have loft height ceilings. Previous posts may have mentioned a loud club, but that was not at all the case during our stay--the bar was quiet and civilized. The hotel itself is clean, chic, and has friendly staff that go out of their way to be helpful. The two best features about this hotel aside from affordable price relative to design features and amenities (rainforest shower heads, flat screen HDTV, free wifi, l'occitane products, etc) are: 1) Central location for experiencing the city--it is within a less than 5 min walk to the Taksim square subway stop and is only one block over from the big shopping street Istiklal Caddesi. With many of Beyoglu's great cafes and restaurants in walking distance. At the same time, it's tucked away enough to be not too noisy (at least not from our top floor hotel room facing the back) 2) Great breakfast buffet--the daily buffet includes delicious fresh fruit and a selection of tasty Turkish cheeses and breads, as well as a rotating variety of warm egg and starch dishes, among others.

We got junior rooms which were so small there wasn't a place to put anything larger than a 22\" carry on. Its nearly false advertising, as the first room displayed on the junior room page is much bigger than all the others. The walls were painted white and all scuffed up. A soda can was left under our bed. Our friends room had mold on the bathroom walls. The bathroom light was on the outside wall, but behind the door when you opened it. The bedroom lights turned on with a tiny easily lost remote control - imagine looking for that when you are up at 5am to catch your plane. The music from the disco pounded all night and when we went to breakfast the same beat was pounding at volume that made breakfast unbearable. There was nothing to drink (water or juice) on the breakfast bar and no service to be found. Other rooms appear beautiful, but when we were offered an upgrade we opted to have our travel agent find us another hotel (on the old side) for the the remainder of our stay.

We booked 3 rooms at the same time (months ago) and were told they were the same type and price. The 3 rooms, 101, 102 and 201 overlooked the cafe/garden by day but it turned into a dinner spot and somewhat of a nightclub in the evening. I'm not a room snob, so when we checked in for our 4 nights I took their word that the \"Elegance\" rooms we all had were the same. I realized after the first noisy night that this was not so. Our room, 102, was about half the size, with only a queen bed in contrast to our friends with big rooms, king beds and comfortable chairs to read in. Our only chair was a really small,uncomfortable desk chair. All of us experienced the noise of the cafe, which on Fri and Sat nights seems to turn into a nightclub and the music blares until 1 or 2* am. About 6:30 am on the morning after our first night, the taped music came on at the same volume as it was the previous night, same singer too. I suspect one of the breakfast room staff arrived and turned it on perhaps accidentally, but it lasted for a good 10 minutes and enough to fully wake us up. Okay, here's the problem with all this. 1. Room 102 is inferior to 101 and 201 regardless of what label you attach to it. When I pointed this out to the guest relations manager, Chiara, all she could say was \"they are all Elegance Rooms\". I suggested she go look at 102 and then explain to me how it can be priced the same given the room and bed size. She seemed to be too stressed out to comprehend what I was saying and gave only a robot response. 2. When I told reception staff about the music coming on at 6:30 am.....their response was that this could not have happened. So, the guest is a liar? Not a good way to handle things. 3. After 2 nights, we asked for a room change.....were offered and took 411 overlooking the street and supposedly a lesser room. Well, it was larger, had 3 big windows with a lovely view of Takism Square, bathroom twice as big as 102 and yes there was street noise, but earplugs cured that problem. How they rate their rooms is a complete mystery. 4. Reception staff were often not very friendly overall and somewhat indifferent to guests. This may be a \"hip\" hotel, but the guests we saw were mostly not \"hippsters\" and I suspect there is a bit of disconect between guest experiences and Lush's trying to have both a 4 star hotel over a noisy cafe/night club. Lush needs to pick what it wants to be. 5. Breakfast food was overall pretty good. Staff service was awful. Every morning I had to hunt down staff to ask for coffee or orange juice. No one ever tried to serve me. Most mornings staff appeared to be arguing about something among themselves and paying little attention to guests. Lastly, when we arrived, Chiara informed us she responded to every Trip Advisor comment. Perhaps she should spend a lot less time on that effort and instead focus on developing Lush's potential to be a really great hotel. Right now the many good qualities of this property and it's potential are crushed by the odd attitude of its staff and the conflict over cafe/nightclub versus good hotel.

There was a mix up with our booking (perhaps equally the fault of Booking.com) in that my partner was to stay longer than me (for busines) and we had asked (in the comments section of the booking form) to be charged a lower room rate for the days he was going to stay alone. We rang the hotel the night before to double check this and they knew nothing of it, remitting us back to Booking.com - this game of tennis continued until we arrived the next day - the staff on reception were reluctant to resolve the problem and even got pretty defensive and told us it was a matter for us to resolve with Booking.com until we insisted that it was the hotel's job to read the booking form very firmly and they finally agreed to resolve it between themselves (which, thankfully they did, otherwise we would have changed hotels). Here is my review of the experience overall: 1. Service: reception can be a bit intimidating, as it's staffed by quite burly fashion-conscious guys, and you don't really get the impression they're there to help you (even though they're courteous) - when we asked for a map they asked if we wanted to buy their 5euro map! Service in the adjoining restaurant where breakfast is served is courteuos and quick with lovely decor. When we had a problem with the wifi (the fault of our cruddy laptop!), the 'IT manager' was incredibly sweet and helpful and did everything he could to solve the problem, even providing us with a USB modem. They also organised an airport transfer for us which was very convenient (35 euros at time of writing) but you need to ask for this as they don't automatically offer it. 2. The room: we knew the room was going to be tiny, so we were prepared for that (we got a junior double), though people used to bigger US-style hotel rooms may find this a shock. The design was stylish and modern though, as some reviewers have said in need of a lick of paint here and there - and we found some bare cables under our bed - not a good idea if you have babies! Lovely l'Occitane tolitries, though they were inconsistent about replacing them which seemed frankly stingy given the cost of the room - you got the impression the maids were going in and measuring how much shower gel you had used to see if you 'deserved' any more. Our double room also had just one robe, though I imagine they would have provided another if we had complained. A/C worked fine ans was needed form tiem to time. 3. The location: we had a room facing the side street rather than the main street, still there was some noise at night, though we are heavy sleepers and it didn't bother us much. I imagine a room on the main road would be pretty noisy. Very central for Istiklal Kaddessi shops, Taksim etc. 4. Breakfast: at first sight the buffet looked a bit sparse with usual Turkish fayre of yoghurts, cheeses, honey etc. BUT, on the tables there is a second cooked menu (which no-one really points out to you) with a selection of hot dishes (the eggs are particularly good) to choose from - these are generally delicious. Oranje juice is also great.

I should have brought earplugs, but I am not sure they would have helped. Hey, the staff was polite. It was clean. Simple but nice design. Rooms were of decent size and the location was fine. My guess is that any other nights beside Friday and Saturday would be fine.

We booked the cheapest room available but am pretty sure we were upgraded because the room was spacious and the bathroom was big. I saw other rooms that were much smaller, basically a bed and a night stand but even those looked cute. The breakfast was standard, cereal cheese bread eggs, etc but also offered fresh squeezed juice everyone morning. The hotel staff were friendly and helped us book dinner reservations most nights. However we always had a specific place picked out, the few times we asked for suggestions they weren't overly helpful.

I am glad we did though. I don't really write reviews often but I thought I should provide a different experience to some of the other reviewers. I booked a few days prior via a travel website and paid 150 euro. We did get a really small room. They have a picture book of all the rooms at reception though, and when I asked if that was a very small room they said yes it was, but that it was a nice room and in a good location to avoid street noise. The friendly staff at reception said take a look and if we wanted to change, they could definitely do that. I guess if the room was more expensive I might have demanded more space but once I saw the room, I thought it was great. Very New York Loft style. Huge ceiling height and large windows which gave it a very airy feel. Having said that, the rooms that end in 03 seem to be the smallest, and those ending with 01 and 02 face the street. 503 is the only room on that floor so seems a little odd (the fitness centre and day spa area are on that floor). I think it was the fourth floor that had a lower ceiling than the others. So I'd imagine room 403 feels small and boxy, The staff really were all friendly though, and I am sure would tell you about the pros and cons of each available room when you book or check in. I really was amazed anyone would have a problem with the staff at this hotel. Maybe we were just lucky, or maybe they changed their staff. Or maybe it's a two-way street... just sayin... We asked for dinner recommendations; they gave us options, made the booking and gave us directions. It was a great restaurant with a lot of locals so we thought it was a great tip. The location really is second to none, a stone's throw from Taksim Square. So yes, there's noise at night. If you want an early night and no noise, maybe stay further out. Something like the Hilton would be much quieter (but not as interesting). We didn't hear any noise from the hallway though, only some outside noise. Again. maybe we were lucky. There is a great marble staircase that goes between floors but there's lots of beautiful and sound deadening drapes which seemed to take away any footsteps. It's not the smallest hotel gym I've seen, and the day spa area is nice and inviting. The bathroom was spotlessly clean, as was the rest of the hotel.

A double/queen bed. 503 - I didn't go in this room but based on my friend's comments...Negatives: Has 2 twin beds. Is the only room on the 5th floor along with the spa. Positives: On the side of the building so not as noisey as the street. 301- Lots of space. King bed. Jacuzzi tub w/ shower. On the back of the building so mostly quite (keep reading for more on noise). Negatives: None Each room has a mini fridge with, a surprisingly NOT exorbitant ,decent selection of drinks and snacks and room for you to add a few things. A kettle and complimentary coffee/tea.

It's very trendy and fashionably decorated - definitely has the feel of a high-class boutique hotel. The staff were very nice - upon checking in, one of the men from the front desk took us up to our room and showed us how to work the A/C, the TV (which has satellite and lots of channels) as well as the lighting in the room which is controlled by a remote (great little extra feature). Furthermore, they have laptops with wireless internet that guests can use for free, and you can even take it up to your room and bring it back whenever you are done with it. Our room was just a regular, basic suite but was still so nice: the bedding was AMAZING - super soft and high quality duvet with heavenly pillows; great flat screen TV with lots of channels; fabulous bathroom and shower with complimentary toilettry kits for men and women which included razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste, shower caps, Q-Tips, a sewing kit, etc. And at this hotel, breakfast is included in the price of the rooms which was quite impressive - a huge buffet of delicious fruits, croissants, yogurts, honey, cereals, granola, toast, etc. We had read some negative reviews of the breakfast at this hotel but I honestly have no idea how anyone could have NOT liked the breakfast served at Lush. Even the service at the complimentary breakfast was fantastic - someone would come as soon as you sat down to ask if you wanted freshly squeezed orange juice, coffee, or even omelettes if you preferred something more than what was at the buffet. Also, we read negative reviews about this hotel in terms of it being \"noisy\" and too loud for some people to sleep - again, I have no idea what these people were talking about as we did not find it to be noisy at all. I consider myself to be a very light sleeper and I can tell you that not once was I woken up in the night by noise from the street at this hotel. Some other reviews had described the hotel as being right on Taksim Square (which is very loud and bustling and always full of people), but it's definitely NOT - it's set back from the square by about a 3-5 minute walk which is perfect because you're still close to the square, but far enough away from it that the noise isn't an issue at all. Don't be fooled by reviews saying this hotel is in a noisy location - it's not, and that's coming from someone who is very easily woken up at night. Also, some reviews noted that this hotel isn't in the main tourist districts of Istanbul and that's absolutely true. However, this was one of the main things we LOVED about this hotel. You're not in the middle of all the cheesy tourist stuff and the massive crowds that surround the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, etc. and personally, I really liked that. The area that Lush Hotel is in is on the other side of the river so walking to all the main tourist sites is not an option - however, it's extremely easy and cheap to get to via the furnicular and then the tram (both run really frequently). Plus the tram takes you across the river so you get a beautiful view of the city each time you venture into the touristy part of town. The area that Lush is in is more authentic in terms of being less touristy, and is also really close to some super-trendy districts that we walked to each night and had a blast in. For example, the restaurant/bar 360 which is one of the most talked-about and trendiest restaurants in Istanbul is about a 10 minute walk from Lush. Plus there's the most fantastic shopping stretch like 2 minutes from the hotel which I spent an entire afternoon wandering - really, really great shopping! The other great thing about this hotel is that the shuttle bus from the Airport drops you off at Taksim Square which, as I mentioned, is a less than 5 minute walk from Lush. So we literally hopped on the bus at the airport, got off at Taksim, and then walked the short distance to our hotel which was great. No taxis, no subway...just a quick walk. This was also really helpful when we left and had to catch the shuttle bus early in the morning. Overall, this hotel is fantastic and gives great value for its money. It's unique and has personality, on top of feeling luxurious and very fun and trendy. I would definitely recommend it and I would stay there again if I'm ever back in Istanbul.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cHip Indeed!\u201d", "Author": "MrFrequentTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR38130812", "Content": "I stayed at one of the Junior rooms and the decor was just like on the picture.

We went for it after reading of it's fantastic location and the fact that it is not a branded hotel but more of a boutique hotel. First impressions of the outside of the hotel and the entrance were positive. It's really a \"hip place\". However the welcoming we received from the staff was nothing but hip. I don't think we even got a customary \"welcome to Istanbul\". We checked in and were taken to our room. It was small unlike the ones we saw online and were a little bit disappointed but overall it was a nice bright and light room. We went for the deluxe room so perhaps we should have opted for the super deluxe instead. The shower in our room was really great as the shower head was huge. The toilet was a child's toilet but it did not bother us as we are not super tall but I suppose it would bother people above 1.80. Our bed was the biggest let down. It was as hard as concrete. We spent the majority of our 4 nights there tossing and turning. A comfy bed is a must in any hotels and this was really not up to any standards. The bed frame was also small and would not fit people of 1.75 which is pretty bad! The overall look of the hotel is great, very hip and modern and the decor throughout is very well thought through. Apart from the bed the other main fault of this hotel is its staff. They are not a welcoming bunch and they don't go out of their way to make you feel special in any way. I would avoid the breakfast unless you just ignore the staff and don't order tea or coffee. I once spent 30 minutes sitting at the bar waiting for a cappuccino that never arrived and when I asked where it was they laughed. Well that is not the kind of service I would have expected from this hotel. The best part of this hotel is its central location. You really can explore all of Istanbul from here and be in a hip and upcoming part of town at the same time. The value for money is great too as for hotels so centrally located you normally end up paying for it whether this one was reasonable. I think if they can work on their customer services, advertise all of their available rooms (deluxe and super deluxe) so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel disappointed and change the mattress in some of the deluxe rooms this hotel would be perfect.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cLush?

I got in touch directly with the property and bought a 3-night package with room, transfers and half-day city tour for 600 euros. The problem began when we arrived, very late at noght and there was nobody waiting for us at the airport. After 30 minutes seraching, I called the hotel and found out the trasfer-guy was picking up 2 people, so my name was written (wrong) in the back of the paper - I would never find him. We ended up arriving at the hotel at almost midnight. By the way, I almost died intoxicated in the way, because the guy from the transfer probably didnt take a shower is the whole week before, cause he stinked like a dead rat. The location is great, just one and a half block from Istiklal, the main peddestrian street (where you can find lots of nice occidental stores, like Diesel). You can walk day and night without problems (also to go to bars in the Nevizade region) and there are lots of public transportation just two blocks away, in the Taskim Square (buses and subways are the best options, taxis always cheat on tourists and charge three or four times the original price). The room was very nice, spacious, very cool decor, nice bed and bathroom. The breakfast was ok also, although too simple for a 4 star hotel, and so did the tour, too superficial, but ok. The biggest problem in the hotel is the service, because almost nobody speaks a good english in the hotel, except a guy who stays in the day and - the most funny part- the guy who takes care of the breakfast. The guy who stays at night is terrible!!! He pretends he understands what we say and gives absurd answers!!! I asked one day how long the tour would take and he answered me is costed 50 euros. The other day I asked him the adress of a restaurant and he said me, in these words: \"you turn the first left, walk 200 meters and ASK AGAIN. It\u00c2\u00b4s a very known restaurant, anyone will show you\".Is it possible that someone from a hotel answers you that? We finally found the restaurant one hour later (and it was 1,5 km away, not 200 meters) and they required reservations. Shouldnt the guy told me that, if he probably knew, since it\u00c2\u00b4s a famous place? Another day, I asked the girl from the reception (there is only ONE person at the reception at a time, so you have no one else to ask) how I could get to Sultanahmet (the old and touristic part) by public transportation and she said me she didnt knew, that she never went there by bus. Since it\u00c2\u00b4s the most visited place in her city and she works in the front desk at a hotel, shoudn\u00c2\u00b4t she know? Or at least try to inform herself to help me, since almost nobody speaks english in the streets?

All of this was happening at my expence because in one houer my plane was taking off.Extremely mad, because me,nothing else than a woman permited herself to speeck to him like that....offended to his heart,he called the police...that wasn`t a problem,i was glad he did it because i knew he wasn`t wright and would have been no problem for me to press charges for violation of privacy,violent language and behavior and also for them to pay my flight tickets ....when he heard this he calmed....1500Euro comming out of his pocket was not such a bright image for him.So we left! Now i want to contact customer protection in Turkey and i am not going to stop untill my story will be read by everyone.In the end ...this made a beautifull weekend into a terriblle experience and changed my opinion about this country 360 degrees...they like to call themselves europeans that have no prejudices,a free country very far from the near and extreme orient`s sphere.The lack of education and there barbarian history is very present!", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Lush Hotel Taksim", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d653452-Reviews-Lush_Hotel_Taksim-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$104 - $278*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Siraselviler St 12</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Taksim</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34433</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> (Formerly Lush Hip Hotel)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "653452", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2f/33/75/lush-hotel-taksim.jpg"}}
