Even the bartender thought to grab my beach towel that I left on my bar stool and kept it for me. She was off duty by the time I came down to retrieve it, but helped with a smile.

I wish I could rate it more than 5 stars First let me start off by saying that the staff in this hotel is outstanding . They are friendly and always go out of their way to make sure you are kept happy throughout your stay. Let me mention a few staff members that I dealt with. Ria and Ashley are the sweetest nicest girls that I have met at a hotel front desk, always greeting us with a smile and accommodating us with whatever we needed. The management is top notch. Lisa one of the managers is exceptional. She constantly made sure each and everyday that we were happy with our stay. She and the staff are what you would say exemplifies excellence in customer service. This is a VERY spotless hotel, maid service did an amazing job in making sure our room was clean in fact the entire hotel is kept impeccable. Our room had an amazing view of pool and beach. Pool is outrageous , kept very clean, Very friendly bartenders , incredible drinks. This is a very family oriented hotel, we met many nice people during our stay. I visited the Hilton right down the street and it is a nice hotel no question about it but I would never choose it over the Holiday Inn just because it is a bigger and more elite. Holiday Inn and Suites really lives up to its standards. Hilton is way to big and chaotic. Holiday Inn is very friendly and they really take an interest in keeping their guests satisfied. Location is so much better at the Holiday INN because its not located on the boardwalk as the Hilton is so its a much more calm location, but yet a short distance to boardwalk. I have become a priority club member because I am more than happy with my experience with this hotel making my families vacation so enjoyable.

Ria explained that they were full up the night before due to family reunions at the hotel but she would be passing the message down to Lisa (Guest Services Manager) and they would try to get us in before the normal 4 pm check-in time. I knew from our reservation service weeks before (see review Outstanding Reservation Service) that Lisa would work her magic and get us in before our scheduled time. Traveling with a baby is an experience in itself and with us arriving at 12, we just wanted a room and some rest. Our stay started off great upon arrival. Lisa and the exceptional housekeeping staff had our room ready 3 hours ahead of schedule. She introduced me to the General Manager of the hotel, Leah, and they made sure to let us know where to come should we have any issues. After a few initials and a signature, we were in our rooms in a timely fashion for such a busy hotel. When we got to the room, as someone who lives on the road, I did what I always do when I first walk into a room; turn the beds down and look in the shower for hair. Housekeeping had it on the spot! As a matter of fact, this group of professionals were constantly cleaning this hotel and walking around with a smile on their face. I only got to know Leroy seeing how the man lives with a mop in his hand. You will find him constantly mopping the floors down in the lobby. The only issue we had with our room was our refrigerator went out, something that is beyond management's control. A quick call to the front desk and Ryan had their technician Nelson up within 5 minutes with a replacement. Nelson was very welcoming and professional and liked to talk about helicopters, especially Black Hawks. Please pass on the thanks to him for the talk! Their restaurant was an enjoyable and soothing place to go in the mornings for breakfast and sit outside listening to the ocean. We had Meridith both times we went and she was always accomodating to make sure we had a good experience. We will definately book again at this hotel if we are ever in the Daytona area. This place echoes leadership from Leah to Lisa down to the rest of the staff. We got to know these people very well and Leah took time out of her busy day to play with our son in the lobby, something that impressed me even more. I'm going to be very suprised if Leah and Lisa are not moving up the ranks within the company and maybe onto IHG soon. I'm sure I will see you ladies outside of Daytona sometime at other HI's.

I ate breakfast each day and it is particularly nice to be able to eat out on the patio looking at the ocean.

The hotel also had a DJ out by the pool on Saturday afternoon and the chef was grilling burgers, hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. I had a hamburger and it was not your usual frozen ground beef patty but you could tell it was fresh ground beef. I complimented the chef and he told me be prepares the burgers himself for grilling. I use Holiday Inns a lot for business travel and the staff here is one of the nicest of any I have met.

There is no way anyone could've missed seeing that nor was there any way a guest could avoid sitting on it. I wiped it off and covered the seat with toilet paper whenever I used the toilet. It obviously hadn't been cleaned at all. The double-queen oceanfront room is a misnomer. It really should be called ocean view. The way the building is constructed, our room sat back behind the pool and another wing of the building, so there was no expansive view like you would normally get with an true oceanfront room. Sitting on the balcony in the cheap $10 molded plastic chairs gives you an eye-level view of the giant top bar on the balcony railing. I couldn't see the beach at all when I was sitting down. It turned out to be pointless to pay for the \"oceanfront room\" since I'd have to stand up if I wanted to watch the waves or the people walking on the beach. The pool is nothing special, and there's no hot tub. It's my own fault for not verifying that there wasn't a hot tub but I assumed that for a hotel of this price and caliber, that there would be at least one. There's certainly ample room on the grounds. I was going to complain about the urine upon checkout, but there was one girl working alone, she was stressed about computer problems, and there was a line of people waiting behind us to check out. If she had asked \"how was your stay?\", I would have told her, but she didn't. Rather than delay everyone's departure even longer, we simply paid and left.

There is nothing like watching the sun come up over the Atlantic ocean, or the way a midnight moon dances on the water with the roar of the seas so loud at night you cannot hear yourself breathe! The hotel is beautifully lit & decorated like a little tropical hideaway. The rooms are cleaner than most & well maintained with eye pleasing furniture & decor!! *The beds, a big deal for me, are VERY NICE & clean; they are covered with the nicest of soft linens, none of those funky large comforters here (you know the ones hotels never wash). The beds are exceptionally comfortable, the 4 pillows per bed with the little markers for firm or soft & the little details make for an inviting good night's rest. *We ordered a very large breakfast to be brought up from the restaurant below- it was both good & reasonal in room service price. The rooms are moderate in size, I'm sure they offer larger suits, we had a basic 2 bed oceanview room. **Oh, I almost forgot the best part the \"View\"... We got an 'ocean-view' versus 'oceanfront', can be huge difference staying on the beach, the view was very nice, true the ocean front would have been awesome & of nothing but sand & sea... But it was very nice & for me an amazing experience!!! Overall, staying here was a great experience. I cannot stress enough the importance & difference the security and key only entrance from the beach makes!!!! They care about their property & their guest & it shows! A word of wise when booking a hotel *google the name of the hotel & see if it has been in the news*! **People have had criminals literally climb from a balcony separated by a wall onto their balcony!! I stayed in a hotel where my medication was taken from my room while I was visiting the beach, where I also became scared by a fellow tenant but when I tried to call the front desk or security my room phone would not allow me to dial out, scared with my family asleep I then googled the hotel and turns out it's the residence of prostitute & other shady activity- all trying to save money at a cheaper hotel & not googling it meant a vacation & memory of Daytona Beach just awful! Daytona Beach, like all tropical beach cities, is plagued with crime & danger- it is very real & do not be naive!!! Be observant & cautious at all times!

The hotel maintained a reasonably large pool area with a private gate to the beach. There was also an on-site restaurant with outdoor bar (sorry, no free breakfast here) and a comfortable, well appointed lobby. The free high-speed Internet access was a nice touch, too. Then we got to our room \u2013 and it took long enough in the slow, small elevators. We had a king suite, with pocket doors that closed off the bedroom from the rest of the room. No balcony, but we did have a very large window to provide a nice view of the ocean. We couldn\u2019t open said window, but we did have a nice view. The AC unit, positioned under that same window, was strong, but not strong enough to cool the entire suite when you closed the pocket doors. Which meant we had to keep the pocket doors open a bit to circulate cold air into the other area of the suite. Which pretty much negated the separate bedroom idea. Sigh. The bed was reasonably comfortable and the shower had good pressure. There were two TVs, but neither unit was HDTV. The small refrigerator in the room did not work \u2013 not the end of the world, since we only stayed one night, but it was inconvenient. Parking was annoying as well. The hotel has a very small parking lot adjacent to its building, but overflow parking is across the street. No big deal if you packed light, but packing light is not an option with a seven-month-old in tow, especially if your vacation is spread across several locations.

We had no problem always finding a spot in the closest lot but to park across the street wouldn't have been a big deal. The road was very easy to cross even though it's 4 lanes there was limited traffic at most times of the day. The boardwalk & pier are about a mile and 1/2 down the beach which we walked daily for some exercise and people watching. The boardwalk has some resturants (Bubba Gump Shrimp), bars, and movie theater. Across the street from the boardwalk is a amusement area with go-karts,mini-golf, arcade, & waterpark. A little further down is the pier which also has a bar & resturant where you can sit & watch the ocean.The beach was relatively clean and hard packed for great walking. At night the beach was very dark as the turtle season is on & hotels aren't allowed to have lights on the beach as it confusses the turtles laying their eggs. The hotel's resturant had good breakfast that could be enjoyed out under the canopy (perfect during the rain) or good pizza we had sitting at the outside bar in the evening.The outside bar & eating area have a large roof over it so you won't get wet or bake in the sun.

Upon arrival were were greeted at the desk by a young woman who was just going thru the motions and doing her job. It was not bad but she seemed to be wishing she had another job. She told us to park across the street because the parking on the hotel property was full. When we checked at least half the on property spaces were empty. It is a bit difficult getting across the four lane highway to the parking lot across the street. The best way to do this is to walk about 150 feet to the stop light and cross when it is safe. We booked a king jacuzzi suite which had a nice view of the beach and ocean. It was very average in decor and was really nothing special. The jacuzzi only had six water jets and two could not be moved. My wife and I both found getting into the jacuzzi was hard because there was not a step up to get in. The hard wire internet conection never did work so we used the wirless from the Desert Inn which was located next door. The connection was great. We did eat one meal in the hotel and the quality and amount of food was lacking. I should have known because the place was empty both days we were there. A better choice to eat is the Olive Garden just a mile or so north of the hotel. The hotel is also located away from almost everything such as place to eat or entertainment so you must drive to everything and in Daytona parking can be next to impossible. On our next trip we will stay at another property in Ormond Beach which is higher rated and less cost. It is not a bad place to stay if you just want to go to the beach.

I was tempted to book at the Ocean Walk for the additional kids activities and pools, but after reading a few of the reviews on this site, I decided that I'd rather not chance our vacation by having a room that we may not enjoy as much.
