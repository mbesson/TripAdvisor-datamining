On the negative side, the room was small (although you're not going to get a mansion for this price in Singapore) and staff just went through the motions. If you're interested in seeing Singapore and are not looking for a luxury stay then this will do the trick.

The disposal linen, the poor air conditioning, space around the bed enough for 1 person to walk around and the wet bathroom with the bits of torn off corners of small packets are there for a reason which my husband and I quickly picked up. The main business of this hotel we assumed from the high turnover of clients at the front desk, appeared to us not to provide normal travelers with accommodation but rather to accommodate the hourly rate which the taxi driver who took us to alternative accommodation verified.

We checked in and were told as we had booked a standard room we had no windows! it smelt decidedly smokey and the bathroom was a damp wetroom - when you shower everything gets wet. We asked whether there were upgraded rooms available and what the difference was - it just a window so we stayed with what we had but were offered any number of rooms until we were happy with the smell! 2nd room was a bit better, however the lack of windows and virtually non existent extractor fan meant the bathroom was pretty damp - hence the general smell of the hotel. To be fair, the rooms were clean (except for the bathroom damp), however we were not keen on the disposable pillow cases that were provided and some inability to make the beds properly (bottom sheet with about 2 foot spare at the top but plastic of matress uncovered at bottom). TV was provided and one of the rooms we saw had a DVD. No fridge or space, just a bed and one side table, no room to swing a cat! Air con seemed to reset itself to 26degrees everytime you left the room and walls are pretty thin. Lavender MRT was fairly close by.

Located on 30 Foch Road, this hotel bordering on motel/hostel was not a happy place to return to after a day of sight-seeing and shopping. My friend and I dreaded going back to it - but since we were blessed with a great sense of humor, we soon learned to laugh off its shortcomings. Tip 1 : if you take a cab from the airport, tell the cab driver that hotel 81 elegance is near the Lavender Food Court. Tip 2: Bring your own towels. Tip 3: Request for a room with a window. Negative Side: The location looked a bit dodgy. As my friend and I were both females, we were a bit scared of the area especially since it was our first time in Singapore. From travel guides and travel websites and plain hearsay, we gathered that Singapore was a litter-free and very clean city -- this area disproved that. There were scary-looking folks and massage parlors all over the area. Staff was inconsistent - we'd ask them to call a cab for us from time to time, sometimes the person at the reception would say okay and call one for us while at other times, they'd tell us to hail one from outside the hotel. Strange. The rooms are very very small. Our jaws fell to the uncarpeted floor when we saw the size of the rooms. We could barely move. There was hardly any room for our luggage. The wall was literally one step away from the bed. And to add insult to injury, we were given a room WITHOUT WINDOWS. Talk about claustrophobia. The rooms are obviously not well maintained. There was a crack on the bathroom door and mould on the bathroom tiles. The floor felt dirty and un-swept. The shower area and the toilet have NO PARTITION so schedule your bathroom breaks and shower times wisely! Good thing the place didn't flood. There is a drain on one part of the floor beside the toilet bowl where the shower water goes. Needless to say, the bathroom was always a wet mess after we bathed. The hotel has a very different idea of 'cleaning'. I think their idea of cleaning is making up the bed and maybe wiping up the bathroom floor. My friend and I wanted to see if they really cleaned the room so we'd leave wadded tissue paper under the bed, partially hidden but still obvious. We came back to the hotel and the wadded tissue paper was still there. Other guests were very noisy. In the middle of the afternoon, another guest on our floor decided to blast \"Crank That Soulja Boy\" from his/her stereo. This was followed by shouting and door-banging and lots of complaining. Only one electrical socket! No smoking rooms. Nearest MRT station: Farrer Park or Little India. Positive Side: The staff were pretty helpful when it came to booking tours for us. Free candy by the reception. Free water in the room. Hair dryer. The hawkers beside the hotel had pretty good food. Try the Pink Guava and White Fungus drink. Cheers (a convenience store) and 7-11 beside hotel. Bus stop right in front of the hotel - except only or two of the buses that stopped there passed along tourist-friendly routes.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel 81 - Elegance", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d779549-Reviews-Hotel_81_Elegance-Singapore.html", "Price": "$70 - $112*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">30 Foch Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">209276</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "779549", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ca/08/ca08684221022925e700638b3fdb895e4large.jpg"}}
