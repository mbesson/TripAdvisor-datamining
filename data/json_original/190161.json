All of the staff was professional, courteous and friendly. We were especially impressed with Willy and Silvia in the Magnum bar area. Besides making great drinks, both of them were so friendly and helpful and we would try to make it a point every evening to go grab a cocktail, just so that we could sit and chat with them. We also had the pleasure of meeting the Assistant Director, Xavier, who was an absolute pleasure. He graciously sent some chocolate covered strawberries and champagne up to our room to welcome us to the hotel. The hotel's staff was very attentive and they even remembered my birthday (on Christmas Day), and surprised me with a cake and a birthday note in our room. The location of the hotel is excellent if you are looking for high end shopping, as all the nice boutiques are nearby. It is also convenient because Corte Ingles sits right behind the hotel, and they have a grocery store inside. We ordered room service on Christmas Day from Tse Yang restaurant, which is in the hotel.

Sadly to say this hotel did not. Despite the accolades and being a leading hotel of the world we could say, at best, that what we received was good but not great - and would probably make us consider staying elsewhere next time we are in Madrid. Why, you may ask? Well firstly before we even arrived - was our disappointment with the airport transfer from the airport to the hotel. On line the hotel advertises a Mercedes S class stretch limousine transfer with a private chaffeur - when we wrote to enquire about an airport transfer they only offered us some Mercedes shuttle bus transfer service. We queried the type of vehicle offered by email and received no response. The transfer was there when we arrived but as mentioned it was a shuttle bus Mercedes and not a comfortable S class stretch limousine as what was advertised as the transfer vehicle on the website. If the hotel had only advised that maybe there was not one available - then we would have been more appeased - but they didn't so this made us somewhat dissatisfied. On arrival at the hotel - reception was pleasant enough yet appeared to have had more than one reservation for us - something we were not aware of as we had only made one reservation online for the hotel, quoting 380 Euros for the first night and 400 for the subsequent nights - reception changed this on check in to 400 for the first two nights and 380 for the last night - probably in case we wanted to check out and not stay - they would then still have get the higher rate. Talk about austerity measures in Spain - or should we just call it day light robbery. On arrival in the room - it was fairly much what we expected - but no more - actually in fact less. There was no complimentary water in the bathroom nor to drink - there was no tea or coffee making service available nor a butler service providing this at no charge. However you could via room service order tea or coffee at an exorbitant 9 or 10 euros each. Whoa!! Don't call me frugal but I do call this pricing somewhat over the top. When we contacted reception to query whether there was any complimentary tea or coffee available we were told sorry no - but later when we went downstairs we did receive a complimentary welcome cocktail voucher for the bar - this was well received and we made our way to the bar when it opened (a place we would not normally venture to) and proceeded to enjoy ourselves for the next few hours trying out delightful Spanish red wine, some appetisers, and a complimentary cocktail from the hotel. We then proceeded to the Chinese restaurant where we had a set menu which was well prepared but as we were so full from the time we had spent in the bar we could not fully appreciate it. The decor and service were pleasant and must be an OK place to go as it was popular there during the lunch hour of the day we arrived. Back to the room we stayed in - the hotel did deliver a fruit bowl with two crunchy green apples and a red apple - which we enjoyed. Aside from this and ourselves the room had no life, no greenery, no flowers. Somewhat austere in line with the economic measures the government is taking in Spain at the moment. The bath and shower were OK. Housekeeping provided more bath essence when we requested it, but the complimentary shoe shine highly promoted in the guest compendium was done to a level which made me not want to get my second pair of shoes done. As for the black stockings and inhaler drugs left in our room by accident (?) by housekeeping it made you question the kind of job they had done. Supposedly we were meant to receive two turn down services a day - but on our last day there they must have thought they would save themselves some time and money by not appearing, nor providing this service. Over our three days there we enjoyed breakfast in the Villa Magna Restaurant. The cooked food was divine and beautifully presented but the buffet food on offer although pleasant to the eye and to taste - was somewhat austere. The dining room on the second day was so warm that the cheeses displayed were covered in beads of sweat and not at all appetising to look at. In addition some of the restaurant staff were so busy gossiping with each other they had no time to check whether the customers plates needed clearing. The daily gossip session appeared to be a morning ritual. Our dining table on a daily basis started to appear like a recycling centre with all these empty dishes waiting to be cleared but seemingly invisible to the staff who were there to clear it away. They brought plates of food to the table but appeared to have some aversion to dealing with dirty dishes and taking them away. In addition they were so inattentive to detail that they did not even notice whether the salt and pepper shakers were filled with salt and pepper and or just plain salt. Two days in a row both our salt and pepper shakers were filled with just plain salt. Not something I would have expected from a restaurant in a leading hotel of the world. We had tea in the lounge twice at a high price of 9 Euros per teapot which contained no more than two averages sized cups of tea. The tea options were plentiful and the tea tasted fine. The lounge chairs were extremely comfortable and it was a nice place to relax and unwind. The cookies provided were tasty and a pleasant accompaniment to the tea. We would recommend the Mandalay tea and Japanese green tea. Safety and security wise this hotel had no security key to the different room levels, any stranger could go up or down and to any guest floor they desired. There were security cameras on the floors but still a security key lock to the guest rooms would be something you would expect from a hotel that markets themselves at this level. Enough said, out of five I would only rank this hotel that charged more than other hotels in town, a 3 1/2 to 4 out of a 5. I feel that some of the staff are resting on their laurels and it is just a matter of time before they lose out to their competitors in the market place if they keep up this level of inadequate service.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "spain", "Title": "\u201cTop hotel with top location\u201d", "Author": "likemallorca", "ReviewID": "UR123874667", "Content": "The hotel is a real 5 star grand luxe hotel.

All in all-- it was a fabulous, comfortable hotel that made a great home away from home for 5 days. My only complaint (and the only reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars) was the breakfast which I thought was seriously lacking given the luxurious nature of the hotel.

It all looks very nice and expensive. The only area that we thought was a little to over the top was the bar. There are also nice outdoor areas for cocktails or dining. We stayed in a prestige room. The room was very spacious and continued the high end contemporary design of the rest of the hotel. The white paneled walls were full of moldings and there was a tray ceiling. There were four chairs in the room, plus a chair at the desk. It would have been nice if there was a couch somewhere in the room instead of so many chairs. Also none of the chairs were set up to view the TV. The TV in the mirror was cool looking, but a regular flat screen would have provided a better picture. So the room was very attractive to look at, but not as functional as it should have been. A great feature of this room was a full closet area that you passed through on the way into the bathroom. There was lots of shelf space and enough room to put two bags aside. The large bathroom was all white Carrera marble with two sinks, large tub, and separate rain shower and water closet.

We stayed in an odd number room with a view of average looking buildings. The even rooms face the tree lined street which must be a better view, but we are not sure about street noise if any. As mentioned, the hotel is set back a little from the road. There is a nice but small gym and stylish locker rooms with steam, sauna, and showers. We did not have a chance to eat in the hotel. We stayed here one night on the back end of our trip to Spain. At the beginning of the trip we stayed just down the street at the Grand Melia Fenix. We liked that hotel better because it had a great club level with a roof top terrace which we really enjoyed along with a room with a private outdoor hot tub. The Villa Magna is also a little farther away from the main tourist locations, but it is right next to the best shopping streets in the city and the nicest neighborhood. If you want nice modern rooms, a pretty good location, and a feeling that you are at the best hotel in town, then stay here.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodstock, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cWow!

I didn't want to stay in the old city because it is so crowded, noisy and touristy. I didn't want to stay at the Ritz because my work would balk at it and all the other high end hotels had something I didn't like about them. The staff is attentive, helpful and kind. It was my birthday while I was here and a bottle of champagne and birthday cake were delivered to my room. Watching soccer in the upscale bar was great fun last night. I can walk to everything and while the hotel isn't gorgeous on the outside, the inside is tasteful, grand, comfortable and really lovely. My room is huge. The amenities are top notch. The gym is certainly well equipped enough and the spa offers lots of high end services. This is a great place for business--easy to meet people here and a great place for pleasure.

We are often in Madrid either for shopping or on our way through to somewhere else. Madrid is one of the most elegant yet dynamic cities in the world. The food is world class, along with the shopping, sightseeing and nightlife. I have stayed in various hotels in Madrid over the years and up until recently I thought the Ritz was probably the best choice. But I hadn't been back to the Villa Magna in 18 years. All I can say if that I was stunned. Sure, the outside look of the building is a bit 1960's concrete but even that is coming in to vogue. The refit and remodel inside is truly gorgeous. I love the 1920's meets the 1950's retro elegance. Elegant is the only way to describe this place (and Madrid itself). The rooms are possibly the best rooms at any city luxury hotel I have been to. It makes such a nice change from the Four Seasons/ Ritz Carlton identikit rooms you find all over the world and it also is a nice change from the Ian Schrager/Philip Starke identikit \"contemporary\" rubbish with small rooms that now litter the world. This is truly a world class city hotel. Unique and stylish. Perfectly located but peaceful. The staff are great too. Highly trained, efficient and seem very motivated to please their guests. Any request is dealt with immediately. We used to concierge to suggest the best seafood restaurant in town and boy, was it (O'Pazo). Overall, this hotel is value for money because it is so good. Book one of the larger rooms as they are really lovely. Do some shopping outside the hotel (the best shopping in Madrid). Take in a museum. Have a siesta. Go for a cocktail in the bar (a martini suits the retro elegance) and then have an amazing meal at O'Pazo. That is one perfect day. If you are there for two days then skip the shopping on day two, take in the Retiro park, walk the streets of the centre of town, go back to your delightful room for a siesta and a change of clothes and then head out into the night for tapas and copas!

Also, the internet policy is a bit annoying. You have to get new codes every 24 hrs and they limit how much you use.

The Villa Magna is like our hotel the Hesperia located at the famous Paseo de la Castellana but a bit more to the south - around 20 min. walking/strolling distance between the two hotels. The building itself of the Villa Magna had really somewhat surprised us because of the name \" Villa \" we had first thought it is a more classical building but in reality we were greeted by a renovated 60' s style building, this we found good because we like actually 60s/70s style buildings, but it was never the less a surprise to us given the name. The entrance was nice with fountains and big drive-way and beautiful lighted tree decoration and very nice more historic, think art deco touch entrance with doorman who opened only the second door out of two, the first odd enough we must open by ourselves to get in / the same had happened at our exit from the hotel. Our first impressions of the hotel it was gleaming modern and new, no wonder it comes fresh from a full renovation which also saw the hotel closed for a longer time and a change of management - formerly it was known as Villa Magna, a Park Hyatt Hotel Madrid. OK, so good, Folks! We saw large spaces all in gleaming marble - mostly in creme and white - and the lobby check-in/ check-out was directly to the left staffed with a lady who gave my fiancee a new hotel brochure which describes the whole hotel at a glance only 4 pages of glossy paper, this we thought represents the hotel just perfectly. Coming from the Hesperia which is decidedly more spanish in colour and warm design, here at the Villa Magna we found actually a more international design in the lobby and the hall plus the lobby Bar and the Lounge. Here are spaces of quiet modern and lofty design with modern art touches on the walls but it comes across rather cold at times especially at the time of our visit, there had not been many people around but seating row upon seating row was rather cold presented in a more modern and glossy design without the warmness of being at a grand hotel in the classical 5 star sense. We had also a look at the Outside Terrace which seemed nicer and much warmer furnished in terms of colour and design than the inside of the Lounge of the Hotel, however we had 2 freshly pressed orange juices at the Lobby Bar to really soak up the service and the atmosphere in our own time during our Visit. Many readers will be probably surprised by the price tag for the juices as they came in at 26.00 Euro incl. Tax and Service. Each glass had 250 ml of juice by the way. This price tag reflects surely the hotel as a status symbol - in fact this is what it is! The juice was also served with crisps on the side. ( In the Hesperia we had two non-alcoholic signature cocktails named VERY WELL! served with an asian nut mix and a bowl of colourful M&Ms to go with for 16.00 Euros incl. VAT and Service Charge ). You can also read our complete Hesperia Review - see our profile here at Tripadvisor - you can also read the reviews from the Eurostars Tower Madrid - located in the second-highest building in Spain the SyV Tower in northern Madrid as well of the Intercontinental Madrid and the Hilton Madrid Airport - a stunner! In all of this hotels we had actually stayed in between 1 night and 3 nights a time! Coming back now to our first look at the Villa Magna, our own verdict from our visit concludes as following: 1.) We ordered first Water melon juice in the Bar which was not available so we had that orange juice 2.) The Service in itself is professional but somewhat cold and even underwhelming without real friendliness, 3.) Room-prices start at 350 Euro a night for a double room without Breakfast - at the Hesperia we had an upgraded 3 room-Business suite incl. full Breakfast and Welcome gifts plus free Voss and San Pellegrino Water for 240 Euros for 2 nights!, 4.) The Public-Toilets are only signed at the Villa Magna in spanish short form without any indication of a normal sign for female or male - when you do not speak spanish this could be a problem! 5.) The seating in all areas looks fine and super stylish - even expensive! - but when you are somewhat shorter - like my fiancee 1. 53m in size - than the seating in the Bar gets very much uncomfortable for her after a certain time! 6.) The location is Superb especially for shoppers because El Corte Ingles is less than 50 m away and Serrano with all the luxury boutiques is also only meters from the hotel! 7.) When you are a 60s/70s building afficonado like we are than the building will be fine - but when you are not a fan of such architecture than it looks more like a office building to you in style of the 60s/70s that is! All in all we can recommend the hotel, but be prepared financially and be in the mood for international high-end style, Michelin starred Restaurant and steeper prices than you would expect in Madrid, than you should be alright. Would we try the hotel? Liking many other Leading Hotels of the World and the romance of true luxury hotels we think with the right reason and preparation financially we should and would give the famous Villa Magna Madrid a try for real.
