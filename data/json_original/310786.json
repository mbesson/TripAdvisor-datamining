After 45 minutes of waiting from the time I arrived, I finally got my room. Asked if they could give me another room when I left my bag in their and told my room was apparently 'lost'. To add insult to injury, my room key was also 'lost'. That meant every time I wanted to go in my room, someone had to escort me and open the door with master key. The room itself was okay, was not expecting much as it was a budget hotel, it had a double bed and small bathroom with a tiny bathtub over shower. Breakfast was okay and had a small selection.

Before booking I read a few reviews and a lot of them were not great, and now I understand why. 1) Hotel Location - it is in a very convenient location, very close to public Tram and a ferry which is handy if you wish to travel to the Asian side. Also it is just 15min walk to blue mosque, which is in the touristic area of Sultanahmet. A lot of restaurants, bars, souvenirs shop, sweet shops are there. Downside: The hotel entrance is just outside a train station where they are also building the new train extension tunnel which will link European side to Asian side. The surroundings are not great; as soonas it rains, there will be mud and pools of water up to the entrance. Not a nice view. I stayed in room 307. 2) The room was booked with internet included, well, from 5 days I stayed, I only had access to internet fro 3 days and event then at random times. They told me that they have a lot of issues with their provider and therefore it happens a lot. The solution they gave me is to use their lounge PC for which you will need to pay 2 TL for 30 min. 3) Service was just a disgrace; impolite and unfriendly staff. Not very helpful and are just seeking to find ways of charging you for things. 4) Room and cleanliness - Room was OK for size and decor. Not much to expect. However, the furniture was old, the beds were uncomfortable, toilet/bathroom was dirt and outdated, needs some refurbishment. The room was not hoovered and the dust never wiped off for my whole stay. They did change towels everyday. 5) Breakfast - Very poor selection of food and not very appetising. The only good thing they had were small pieces of ''cheese bread'' and cheese plates. Nothing else. My recommendation would be to search for other hotels in the area, as i could see that there are a lot of them.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cOk\u201d", "Author": "Katique", "ReviewID": "UR81493393", "Content": "the hotel was ok.

I 5 min. you can be on tram to either ferryterminal, Taksim or Hagia Sofya- unless you like to walk. Restaurants, kiosks, supermarkets, baklava bakeries etc. just around the corner. Askoc hotel is located behind the Gar- Trainstation- the street it not dodgy or bad- backstreets does look like that in Turkey, holes, garbage and wild cats and dogs. Garbage is emptied daily and holes repaired once in a while, streetlights are there in evening. But yes, trainstations does tend to attract the more doubtful types- but they are not in front the Askoc. Transfer: You need to know one thing when going to Turkey- timetables etc. are not important to Turks- mainfocus is that you will get there. 15 mins. delays on pick-up is not considered bad and does not need an excuse. Always be in good time when going anywhere- and use the waitingtime wisely. In Turkish terms Askoc hotel is in fact a 4star hotel- some rooms are very small, some noisy and they do not contain the newest designer furniture. They are kept clean, good selection of sattelite channels, and if anything is missing go ask for it. Do you get a bad room, go to reception and ask for a new one- with a smile!! I was in a bad room first night, asked for a new room next day and got it without problems. Yes, sometimes lifts are out of order, and it might not be repaired at once- but eventually it will. Take the other one. Staff- I found everyone to be very kind and helpful- try a few words like hello or thanks in Turkish and you will experience a diffrence. Turks are very interested in you, your language, your country etc. But not if you just show up with attitude as you are superior to them- Turks are very sensitive to this matter. When you travel to Turkey- be prepared, buy a map and know what you want to see- many locals (and some hotelstaff) does not always know everything- thats the way it is, like it or not. Mostly they will not admit they dont know but starts a longer lecture for you- just nodd your head and say thanks and start searching....*hahaha*. If you start complaning about that you will be ignored- Turks are proud people and do not want to know about their ineffencies- they live with it, and you have to accept it while beeing there. But showing respect to them make them do whatever they can to help you- and that can sometimes include the whole family. Just remember that. Food: Normal breakfast is white bread, olives, cucumber or tomatoe, a kind of spread cheese- coffee or tea- The Askoc has many other things to offer- so no complaints really. Continental, English or american breakfast you will get at the conrad, hilton, interconti etcetc. Local hotels are not for everyone- they are local, turkish and wth the serivice which comes with it. some 3 star hotels might be better than some 4 star hotels- but the Askoc does deserve its 4 turkish stars. You might consider to book a chain-hotel if you have specifics, because you can not expect it in a local hotel. Istanbul is worth millions of visits- I can not get enough of it- I love The Turks, their hospitality, helpfulness, kindness, the food etc.. The city contains many treasures- and not only the must sees for the first visit. Go explore and enjoy it- Istanbul is old, new, posh, kitch, modern, stinky, kaotic, not well planned, exotic, fun and ever so beautiful- just dont expect it to be like everywhere else- Istanbul is Istanbul!", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cStay away!\u201d", "Author": "jetter21", "ReviewID": "UR23957659", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights during January of 2009 and I would not recommend it to anyone.

I was frustrated, fumed and upset with total reception we got in this hotel. 4 stars hotel in turkey means one star in London. Be careful when you book your holiday in Istanbul especially with such rubbish hotels", "Date": "August 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGood Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "jammy100000", "ReviewID": "UR8038771", "Content": "We went to Istanbul in July. Such a beutiful and magnificent city! the hotel Askoc was clean, basic and above average , better than the second hotel(Best Western Obelisk) I stayed in on my break. It had a beutiful view from the roof but the photos of the hotel can be misleading as no restaurant on the roof. We go on to the roof to find broken chairs and dirt and deluge but a terrific view. If you're booking the Askoc because of the terraced reataurant -don't becauase there is none!! overall, fairly good hotel and good value for money. hotel receptioninsts can be a bit rude but be sure to give them a slight tip to keep them happy. bathrooms O.K ish and would like to go to the same hotel in the future. P.S huge high walls in front of the hotel may look grand in photos but has a tube/train station directly in front. top floor rooms will have a good view of the mosques and landscape though. P.P.S beware of the taxis-will charge high prices and may trick you. better to travel on foot to places.", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cTwo-star station hotel\u201d", "Author": "Beamy", "ReviewID": "UR7712867", "Content": "I would rate this hotel as 2 star instead of 4 star as it rates itself. The services are nowhere near 4 star. Most of rooms are size of matchboxes, smell of tobacco smoke and are overlooking the old building roofs. Bathtubs in standard rooms are tiny. If you want a slightly more spaceous room with a seaview you will have to pay quite a lot of extra money (and will get no receipt for it - the staff would not charge anything to your room or card - cash only). The choice for breakfast is so poor that I can not even compare it to a basic Turkish 3-star or a European 2 star or a students' hostel. The soundproofing is non-existent between the rooms, so you will hear every word and sound from the neighbours toilet and bedroom. The bathroom standards choice is very poor - you will get a small bar of soap and a bottle of shampoo (can't guarantee it has not been used before u checked in - as it happened to me). Don't expect hoovering done in the room - there is not such a device in housekeeping possession. The nice views from the top floors or terrace are not enough to make this hotel worth staying in.
