No need to add much. The hotel is very pleasant, clean, has comfortable rooms, excellent beds, friendly and helpful staff. The location is great, near the S bahn station from where you can travel all over Berlin in a couple of minutes. The Ku'damm avenue is just around the corner and has everything for a drink and a meal, but if you go a bit further to the Savigny station (s bahn to Westkreuz, then 2 more stations only - or take a cheap cab) you will be in the middle of a bohemian district with plenty of bars and resto's. In particular the Bleibtreu street is to be recommended. And make use of the hotel facility to rent a bike for only 5 euro a day. The bikes are quite ok but ask the hotel reception to see the bikes the evening before to make sure the tyres are well filled and the chain oiled (in our case this was not well done - it was the only weak point in an otherwise very correct and service minded hotel). The great moment is when you get back your hotel, coming out of a city with lots of beton and modern buildings, it is a treat to see the romantic shape of the hotel, the nice garden with a terasse before it, and the wunderful lounge full of books indside.

Easily reached by bus from Tegel (Buy a Berlin Welcome card at the airport, the onto bus 109 into Berlin, off at Adenauerplatz at the junction, then any bus down the Ku-Dam to S Halensee, walk over the bridge and turn right to the hotel set back off the main road). Likewise we could get anywhere in berlin by bus or train right close to the hotel, so it was really convenient for getting about. Hotel very welcoming and helpful, excellent buffet breakfast, and a wireless lan available in our room so glad of that. Some reviews comment on trains nearby, well we stayed in room 265 at the front of the hotel, and yes we could hear a train now and again but it was not a disturbance in any way, and the surrounding street were very quiet throughout. Taxi in the early hours back to Tegel was 12 Euros which the hotel booked for us no problem, just a short 10 minute hop to get there, but the driver said Berlin is getting a new bigger airport soon so a longer taxi run due when that cuts over. When we got the bus from Tegel we took a moment at Adenauerplatz to orientate ourselves which bus to get next, and spotted an imbiss called \u2018Curry mit Bis\u2019 by the bus stop \u2013 we had excellent schnitzel and chips there sat at the street tables, and followed by an excellent coffee before crossing the road to get the bus to Halensee, and an excellent snack and start to out break there. When we go back to Berlin, and we will, we\u2019ll have no hesitation staying here, and wish we\u2019d found this place for our previous visits. Next time we\u2019ll go for a suite to get an adjoining room, but the standard rooms are fine \u2013 high ceilings, quiet, good mini bar (not horrendous prices), good sized bath, very hot water, things like bathrobes and slippers available on request, etc, so a good place that really looks after its guests \u2013 even English language papers for free in the rack by the lift in the lobby.

The reception area is library-like with bookshelves, and free tea is served (self-service) in the afternoon (ice-tea in our case, as it was hot outside). You get a real key (not a card), and the furniture is old style - sometimes a bit worn, but for me it was part of the atmosphere. We stayed two nights in one of the romantic rooms on the fourth floor. This room had A/C, which made the room cool and fresh without noise. The room faced the S-bahn, and it was heard but it did not disturb us much. Perhaps bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. Our room had a balcony, which was very nice, but it could have been better furnished (had only two chairs and no table). The balcony did not have much of a view, but there was a huge tree just outside with birds singing, so it was a nice place to take a drink in the evening. Both the room and the bathroom were of a good size, and the bathroom was modern-looking, tiled with a bathtub and decent water pressure. Amenities (soap, nail kit, shower cap, shower gel, body lotion) are provided, and a range of other amenities are provided free upon request. There is information in the room about the services and amenities available, and they are quite generous, but, importantly, you may have to ask for things that happen or are given automatically in other hotels (such as shampoo and change of linen). Check this information or you may be frustrated. The minibar is very decently priced (for example, 0.5 l beer is 2 euros), and so is the internet (24 hours for 5 euros, worked very well). Free internet is available (one computer) in the reception area. The breakfast is fine, but not excessive (four kinds of bread, scrambled eggs, sausage, one type of cheese, two types of ham, salami, fruit salad, two types of yoghurt, salmon, cereal bars, fruit juices etc). Coffee, tea and hot chocolate is served at the table and the coffee was very good. Staff (both in reception and breakfast area) was very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a small garden and a few tables and chairs where you can sit outside. The area where the hotel is located is rather charmless, but there are a few shops, cafes and restaurants.

There are many restaurants and bakeries close-by in walking distance. I would recommend ArayaThai-excellent Thai food just down/across the street and there was also a Greek restaurant that opened late and served huge portions (Sorry I forget the name now). Lots of little bars and shops around as well. The hotel itself was very cozy. The rooms were a little larger than in other European countries but still not large as in the US. The neighborhood was indeed very quiet. The staff all spoke fairly good English and was helpful and very accommodating. I don't recall the rooms being air-conditioned. We slept with the windows open and that was fine. The breakfast was quite assorted-sliced meats, bread, eggs, cereal, sausages (of course) & fresh fruit. No complaints here. I would definitely stay here again or recommend this to someone looking for a quiet hotel in Berlin with some \"old world\" charm.", "Date": "July 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant place to stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3445914", "Content": "I'm late in comenting on our stay at the Kronprinz since I have just discovered TripAdvisor. But we were so pleased with our stay there last summer that I want to encourage others to try this hotel even though it may seem out of the way. This was our first trip to Berlin, and I nearly cancelled our reservations when I realized how far from the main sites it is; that would have been a bad mistake. With Berlin's great user friendly transport system nothing is far away; the Kronprinz is less than 5 mins from the U-Bahn station and from a bus stop where busses to all parts of the city stop every few minutes. Though cabs seemed readily available, we travelled everywhere, night and day, by bus or train. So don't let the location deter you. It is actually an advantage to be away from the more hectic areas, and there were a number of restaurants within easy walking distance. As for the hotel itself, we had an very pleasant room -- adequate size PLUS a sunny alcove with chaise, table and chairs. Bath was smallish, but modern and clean. The staff was very helpful and friendly.", "Date": "May 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "netherlands", "Title": "\u201cnice and cozy hotel\u201d", "Author": "paul_nl", "ReviewID": "UR1134341", "Content": "This hotel is located at the end of Kurfurstendam in a quiet neighborhood.
