It is also closed to Gaudi Park, so you can get there by just walking. The rooms were clean and the staff was very helpful. The breakfast does not offer the possibility of a wide choice, so I would recommend eating in one the small cafes around. They have special local food you can try. Also, we were provided with soap and shampoo only at the beginning of our stay. After this, nothing else was offered. But taking into consideration that it is a 2 start hotel and the price, we were OK with our staying.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBED BUGS!\u201d", "Author": "Eur0Trip11", "ReviewID": "UR118923050", "Content": "Need i say more?

However we didn't feel as secure given the quality of the lock and the surrounding environment (residential, but it didn't look great). It was also way too far from the city centre, but convenient transport - the bus stop to Las Ramblas or Passeig de Gracia was right outside the hotel. Friendly staff nonetheless, they had everything we needed (asked for a sewing kit and they gave me a sewing kit with 55 colours and 20 different sized needles!).

Not the best service to expect... The bedroom was upstairs (didn't see any elevator), small, facing inside (so no view at all) and the AC was not cooling (worked as a fan only), but it was clean. As well as the bathroom. The location is not as close to the Metro as they say in their website. \"A few steps\" is more like a 15 minutes walk, uphill, from the closest station... It's close to Parc Guell tough. All in all, if you don't mind walking and is staying for a max of a couple of nights... It works.. For more nights I wouldn't recommend. And I got a great deal.. otherwise, I'd feel like it wasn't worth it at all.
