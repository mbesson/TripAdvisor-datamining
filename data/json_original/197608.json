They didn't ask for our passports/ids upon arrival so anyone could have checked in/entered without being questioned. The hotel rooms were small, dirty and smelly (I stayed in a room with 1 full bed). My boyfriend woke up with bug bites after sleeping in the bed, and as we were checking out, another American guest was yelling at the front desk that there were bugs in her bathroom and that they couldn't even shower, and the front desk wouldn't change their room! The room was so small that you couldn't walk around the bed without hitting the window, and the water in the shower actually stopped working mid-way through my ice cold/steaming hot shower.

Bathroom smelled a little a times but the TV was awesome quality. We stayed in room no. 60 which was spacious and quiet. No view as it looked out onto another building but we were happy with that.

It's 1 minute walk from Pigalle underground which was very convenient as we used this everyday to get to and from everywhere. Overall it was great value for a good hotel. Paris can really be touch and go but I would definitely stay here again if I were on the same budget (less than 100euros a night) and it's better value if you book it through the Eurostar website. One thing: BE WARNED! Pickpockets are everywhere in Paris and though we were not robbed, we were approached every day by pickpockets. People pretending to be deaf and asking you to sign paper on a clipboard are out to rob you. They do not work for charities. On our 2nd day we saw 4 youths continuously walking closely behind tourists trying to steal. It was upsetting to witness as there is little you can do.

I think to explain this comment, I need to say my story. My boyfriend and I booked two nights at Atlanta Frochot on Hotwire. In the confirmation, it stated that the booking included complimentary breakfast. We arrived at the hotel. They told us there was no breakfast and that it was 9euros each per day. Of course, this was unacceptable. They said that it was not their problem because they use a booking agency and the booking agency confirmed that no breakfast was to be included. Of course, for them, the customer is not always right. They were not willing to do anything for us. All I was asking from them in the end was some sort of confirmation that we did not receive breakfast, or the contact information of the booking agency that they used, and they refused!! Finally, I called Hotwire (at my own charge) and they tried contacting the hotel and the guy at the front desk simply told the person that it's not his job to confirm that we did not have breakfast. All sorts of other little things happened in regards to the attitude of the front desk personnel. They would completely ignore us for extended periods of time while we would be waiting to get our room key. Also they would talk badly about us in other languages to other people around, as though we were the cause of the problem. On top of all this, as we were trying to check into the hotel, there were a pair of ladies who had made a booking through a travel agent and it turns out that the hotel \"did not receive the confirmation\" from the booking agency and so they did not have a room for them. And they refused to do anything to help them. All I can say is steer clear of this place.

There are also plenty of restaurants, a pharmacy, a few grocery stores nearby. Unfortunately, the everything else nearby is inappropriate for children. It's the reddest red light district I've ever seen. It just goes on and on and on for blocks of filth and porn. I never felt unsafe, but I was afraid to talk to anyone I saw for fear they were perverts. And I wouldn't go out on the street without my husband. Period. He went out alone once and was propositioned. The negatives -- Again -- it's in the red light district, which was kind of silly to us, but the glare of the red lights got old after the second night. (We booked for four nights.) The hotel staff requests your room key every time you leave the building. Um, that's weird. They said they only had one key and if we lost it, we wouldn't be able to get back into our rooms, so they request that guests leave the key at the desk. I didn't like that much for security reasons. The wireless Internet access is expensive and unreliable. We ended up going to the nearby McDonald's to use their free Internet. Our room appeared clean upon first inspection, but it was surface only. Upon closer inspection, everything was dirtier than it appeared. For example, there were hairs stuck to the walls above eye level in the shower. Grossest of all, I picked up the phone one day and the underside of the reciever was covered with what appeared to be earwax. Ewww. Our room faced directly into neighboring apartment buildings, and there was no way to leave the windows open without leaving the curtains open. Also, the residents of neighboring buildings were REALLY loud -- playing awful music at high decibels during all hours of the night and occassionally, just hollering out the window, I guess for fun.

The location is great - near Pigalle metro station, which serves 2 metro lines. Bus stop is also there, takes you to Gare du Nord (if you come by Eurostar) within 5-7 minutes, it is quicker and more convenient than metro for Gare du Nord, since the bus is direct, but if you go by metro - you need to change the metro lines, which can be very tiring, if you have heavy luggage, since most of the metro stations don't have escalator, so, being a Londoner, I assumed there would be lifts/escalators (they have lots and lots of steps, so dragging your suitcase is a nightmare!), and deeply regret my metro journey to the hotel - should have caught the bus - quicker and much more comfortable. The rooms a extremely small and basic (which I expected after reading other reviews), however clean. The staff of the hotel is polite, but the night shift guy was not helpful at all. I didn't like the fact that they don't have bath tubs in single rooms, and they couldn't move me to another room saying they were fully booked. The view from my window was plain cracked grey wall of the next house, couple of meters away, but I was not too bothered, since I didn't come to Paris to stare through my window. The noise level is very high, you have a feeling that there are no walls at all, they are extremely thin - you can hear every breath (not only every word) of guests passing through your room as well as staff talking and cleaning, in fact, staff were always waking me up by noisy talking and banging the doors in the nearby rooms, which was quite upsetting. The breakfast is very poor and plain - you can have only tea/coffee/hot chocolate/grapefruit or orange juice and 3 buns (not more or less, exactly 3 every morning) - one being croissant, another - plain bread bun and third - chocolate bun. You may have jam with it, and occasionally honey. It was very boring and plain breakfast. They serve breakfast between 7am and 10am. One day during my 3 days saty the elevator broke, so guests due to check-out (it is 6 storey building!) had to drag the suitcases via staircase (which is very uncomfortable, see the image of staircase!), it was fixed quite a few hours later. On my last night in Paris I booked Moulin Rouge show directly in the hotel (89 euro) and enjoyed it a lot, walked back to the hotel after the show alone - at 1am - still not scary, the area is very safe and quiet (really!), if you are a solo female traveller like myself, you just need to ignore, if anyone starts talking to you (some sex shops sales people, etc). I would recommend this hotel to tourists on budget, who is not too fussy, who comes to spend time in Paris, not in a hotel room.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucestershire", "Title": "\u201cBasic but clean - interesting location!\u201d", "Author": "Vanessa_visitor", "ReviewID": "UR13554843", "Content": "This hotel is basic but clean and the staff are friendly. The room was small but functional and ours had no bath but it did have a shower. The location is a bit unnerving at first being metres from the Pigalle Metro station (which rumbles underneath the hotel at night; this however did not disturb us). It has a 24 hour reception. Pigalle is the red-light area with numerous but relatively discrete adult shops only metres from the hotel - lots of neon but nothing on display. You would be concerned if you had younger children - too many explanations required! The Pigalle area however is definitely not threatening. Montmartre is about 2 mins away across the Boulevard de Clichy - interestingly, the only 'lady of the night' we saw was actually in Montmartre. The Sacre Coeur is about 10 mins walk but involves many arduous steps. Drinks are very expensive in the Place du Tertre (the pretty square) in Montmartre - a tonic for our vodka was 8 Euro (the vodka only 6 Euro). Great area though - we'd stay at the hotel again. 15 mins easy walk from Gare du Nord. Easy walk also to the Boulevard Haussmann (for the shops).", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "Internationaljs", "ReviewID": "UR13247630", "Content": "My sister and I travelled to Paris in early February for her first visit to the City of light. The hotel was reasonable for the price, considering we booked the night before. Highlights: * Fantastic location close to Pigalle metro station (500 meters) making it easy to get around Paris. You could easily walk up to Monmarte for a weekend breakfast at a cafe, and we also enjoyed a pleasant walk down to the Louvre (stopping at Gallerie Lafayette for a bit of shopping. * Room was small as expected, but comfortable, with a reasonable bathroom. * If you stood on one of the beds, you could see the top of the eiffel tower from the window - among the rooftops! Lowlights: * Breakfast isn't that exciting. Just bread based really - not a full continental set up. * The hotel is rather noisy. We were in room 60 on the top floor right by the elevator - not good for light sleepers. * The shower was tiny and surrounded by a shower curtain that inevitably lead to a very wet bathroom floor. I was glad I was with 5'3\" sister and not 6'2\" fiance who would have hated it.

Although it was advertised as being in Montmartre, it didn't take us long to realise it was really on the outskirts of Pigalle (red light dstrict). This means that I wouldn't really recommend it for families with children or perhaps older couples, but unless you're VERY easily offended, the location was brilliant! We were literally a 2 minute walk away from the Pigalle metro station which meant we were able to get to most areas of Paris very easily and cheaply. If you're planning a trip to the Moulin Rouge, this hotel is ideally situated. We booked a trip that included a tour of the illimunations but rather than bothering with a lengthy wait for the return coach, we walked the 2 blocks back. It was almost 1.30am but at no point did we feel nervous or intimidated, which is more than could be said of walking through many UK town centres at that time of night! The staff were absolutely FANTASTIC! We had booked a dinner cruise for the 1st night but were unsure how to get to the correct area of the Seine, which was apparently not a common place to get to. The receptionist spent at least 10 minutes finding out the best route for us to take and even the manager himself stopped to make suggestions. They were equally helpful throughout the trip, giving us detailed instructions on how to get to places and always cheerful. Reception is open 24 hours and they were equally as welcoming at 1.30am as 10am! There's no restaurant but continental breakfast was included in the price with a delicious and generous selection of freshly baked breads, freshly squeezed fruit juices and hot drinks. The room was small but extremely clean and comfortable, and the ensuite bathroom was immaculate. Having read other reviews about noise, we requested a room at the back of the hotel. This was a good idea - although it meant the view wasn't great, we got a good nigh's sleep. The hotel advertises having satellite tv but be aware that these are not English speaking channels. However, few people go to Pars to spend much time in their hotel so if you are looking for cheap, clean comfortable rooms in a great location with a lovely continental breakfast, this hotel cannot be more highly recommended.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Clean, Budget hotel!\u201d", "Author": "twinklepops", "ReviewID": "UR11151260", "Content": "Great location...steps away from the Moulin Rouge and Pigalle Metro station!

When he came to my room (to use the internet connection) an employee said to me, \"This is not a hotel where we allow this behavior\". I asked them what they meant and they said having men to my room (prostitution). When my friend came a second time the employees were talking amongst themselves in French (not knowing that he speaks French) and called him a \"pimp\". Needless to say, I would NEVER stay here again. While I understand that their location in the RED LIGHT DISTRICT could lend itself to becoming a place where prostitutes could take men, it is completely unacceptable to accuse normal guests of this behavior simply by having a male friend stop by.
