Stayed at the Guitart Grand Passage Hotel in Exiample. As there were 3 of us, we booked a triple room which included a suite of 2 rooms; one with twin beds and a TV and the other with a single bed, a sette and chair and also a TV and fridge. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we were shown into a room with three single beds which was not acceptable. The guy on Reception was very accommodating and moved us to a suite room. The rooms were large and airy with a nice balcony overlooking the street below. This is a quiet area and just what we needed. It is a short bus ride to Playa Catalunya in the centre but the hop on hop off bus is just around the corner which we utilsed for two days. This is the best way to see Barcelona and not too expensive. There are lots of little cafes just around the corner on Diagonal as the hotel is quite expesive for breakfast. I would also recommend dining at the fish restaurants next to the Marina at the beach as they tend to have special offers in the evenings. We had an exceptional meal at the La Sendaro costing 15 euros for 5 courses plus a free glass of wine. I would not however recommend the Bar Velodrome for a meal (which is opposite the Hotel) as you get a mere morsal for a considerable amount of money. I would truly recommend a vist to Barcelona as this is a lovely city and would certainly stay at the Guitart Grand Passage Hotel again.

There is a bus station near the hotel, 58 goes to Placa Cataluna (you can use a metro card for the bus),and just near the hotel there is a touristic bus station. metro is about 10 minutes walking. if you like to walk it's ok but we found that a taxi is an easy way and not so expensive (for family of 4). I like the location- elegant, nice and safe to walk even at night. you can find everything in the streets around- icecream, piza, tapas and more. We found a bakery along Muntaner st. and also a supermarket and fruits store. Bar Vel\u00f3dromo near the hotel is a good place for coffee.

The staff are able to speak English and it's located in a good area of Barcelona for traveling, however, it is at least a 10 minute walk from the nearest metro stations recommended by staff -who can speak English which is helpful- but there are a lot of buses nearby. As soon as we arrived, I realised I had left the printout of our confirmation for the booking and the woman behind the reception desk said we could use the hotel's computer. However, when we checked out we noticed that we had been charged for an hour's internet use- the gentleman at checkout did waive this fee after we explained how the first woman (probably in her 40s, dark hair, stern expression) didn't explain the full story. The room itself was very unimpressive. Everything was old. The bathroom was quite nice and towels etc were replaced daily by the cleaning lady. The extra beds were essentially sofas and VERY VERY VERY uncomfortable. The main double bed consisted of two single beds joined together (see pictures attached), but they were not as uncomfortable. A huge issue we had was the incredibly noisy middle-aged men that were in the room next to us- they were very loud and kept going until 3am. In summary- I would NOT recommend the family room and this hotel for families, but if you find a cheap deal and are going as a couple or friends then it should be okay.

So we were expecting about the same for this place. We couldn't be more pleasantly wrong.

All the rooms have glassed-in balconies, with view of the street. The beds were comfortable, the shower hot and strong, with an attentive, helpful, and friendly staff - who do not appear to exsist merely to hold their hands out for a tip. We spent 4 days exploring the wonderful city of Barcelona after our cruise. We are thinking about perhaps taking another cruise to other ports out of Barcelona, and would really love to stay here again.

Valentinsday in Barcelona. We could not have chosen a better hotel! When we stepped into our suite, all 42 rooms in the hotel are suites, our jaws dropped because the room was beyond our expectations! Long hallway, big marble bathroom, bedroom with kingsize bed and flatscreen tv, cosy livingroom with flatscreen tv and balcony. Slidingdoors seperated the bedroom from the livingroom. Stunning! Staff speaks excellent English and are wonderful! Location is perfect: Avenguda Diagonal is just around the corner which is the main long street in Barcelona. La Sagrada Familia is 15 minutes away by foot, Passeo de Gracia is 10 minutes away by foot. This will be our hotel in Barcelona when we come back and we will soon!
