The front desk staff we dealt with were wonderful with the exception of one getlemen, he must of had a bad day but at the end he was very nice. We stayed in building 1 which has been remodeled after the earthquake, and they were nice and clean. Missing a few amenities and the room service was ok. They forgot to leave coffee sometimes or to place a trash in the bathroom, but overall it was a nice place to stay and relax. One thing we did not like was the outdoor pool, it was at the other building with no shade, and not the most convenient way to get there. We had to go through our building and then walked through the parking lot in our suits, crossed the grass area and then enter building 2, take the elevator and finally found it. The pool itself was very nice and clean, just again not very convenient. Our building had the indoor pool, unfortunatelly the day we tried for some reason the heat was on and as it was outside, there was no way to enjoy it. Breakfast time was great, they alternate it every other day, so always the same, we would have liked to have some fruit, yougurt, available, but the lady that runs it is so amazing that you do not miss that once you talk to her. Loved the idea of having homemade oatmeal, and the pancake machine was an exit. Again, we enjoyed the area so we ended up adding an extra night to our stay and hated to leave. Kuddos to the front desk for making us feel so welcome and providing very clear directions to located places to visit.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Marque, Texas", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Stay\u201d", "Author": "ShirleyTrahan", "ReviewID": "UR139377150", "Content": "We stayed here at the Grand Oaks for Labor Day weekend and it was great!

I had read previous reviews so wasn't sure what to expect - some were great and some not so much. I was pleased with the hotel. We just had a regular king room, which was newsly remodeled and very nice and up-to-date. The bathroom was a little small, had to move to the other side of the toilet to open/close the door. The shampoo/body wash dispenser was nice - I like the idea. The towels were big and fluffy and there was plenty of hot water in the shower. The bed was comfortable and there were four nice pillows supplied. Our room was on the first floor, and the ice machine was on the second floor. Not that big of a deal, but FYI. There are two hot tubs, but the jets were out of order on one. The other one was just the right temperature. We were in Building 2 and the hot tubs and indoor pool are in Building 1. They didn't tell us we had to pick up towels from the reception area, we learned that the second night, fortunately we had brought our own. We didn't get in either pool, but they looked clean. I had read a lot about the breakfasts being so great. The first morning we had breakfast we were disappointed. There was no protein available and everything was carbs (biscuits and gravy - altho the biscuits were VERY good, pancakes, cereal, etc). Not healthy for a pre-diabetic. The next morning there was sausage and eggs and they were both delicious, along with pancakes and cereal. That's when we found out they alternate the \"protein\" between the two buildings - not sure why they do it that way? We didn't find the hilly parking lot an issue, as I had read in another review. The parking lot is hilly but if you are able to park close to the building, you don't notice it so much. The staff was very friendly and helpful when we asked for their recommendation of a place to eat. The WiFi was reasonably fast. The hotel is conveniently located to restaurants and activities, including Silver Dollar City, although it was in a quieter area off the main route. Silver Dollar City has added a lot of things since I was there last. Many more activities and rides for smaller children. All the demonstrations are still fun to watch, even though I've been there many times.

We went with 2 adults & 2 kids age 9 & 5. The room was so small, you barely had room to walk between the bed & the TV. There was no place to plug in our cell phones. The curtains wouldn't shut all the way. There were only 3 towels for 4 people. We asked for more towels & they gave us 5. That 1 thing was the only good thing about the place, because the next day they didn't clean our room & only had 2 towels to give us. We had the do not disturb sign on our door until 11:30am, then left for the day & changed the sign to service please. When we returned at 7:30pm, our room had not been cleaned. We had a show to go to, so I didn't have time to go the front desk. I called & was told the cleaning people had gone for the day & they put on their notes we had DND sign. When told we left at 11:30 & changed the sign, they said \"Oh, they should have went back & checked your room before they left for the day.\" They did not know how that happen. They told us when we got back to stop at the front desk & they would give us some towels & trash bags if we needed them. We did not get back until 11:30pm & they only had 2 towels to give us. No apologies, no offer of anything to make up for not cleaning our room. The parking is horrible also. They do not have enough parking in the front of the building, there is parking in the back, but your room key won't open the back doors. You have to walk up the hill to the side doors. We pulled around front to turn around & there were workers out front smoking. The girl said wait a minute & I will move my car so you can park.

Refrigerator, Microwave & coffeepot was in the room. Our microwave never worked. We reported this the night we arrived & after 6 days it was never fixed or replaced. They were nice enough to let us use the one in the breakfast area. Breakfast was either eggs (instant) and sausage links or bisquits & gravy (also instant). Cold cereals, oatmeal, bagels, toast (the toaster had problems). The coffee was great. The room was clean and fresh towels put out daily. We got this room through a package deal. It worked for what we needed. It was always quiet, even when people were coming back from some of the late activities that go on. The beds are new and we slept great. There is a Walmart around the corner so if you need anything it is close. There are 2 mini golf courses down the street. The Titanic musuem is fairly close as well.

I even liked the pillows and I NEVER like hotel pillows! The staff was friendly and helpful. The only thing that was disappointing was the breakfast. They alternated between biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs. I didn't try the biscuits so can't say if they were any good or not, but the eggs were just okay. The pancake machine is at the end of the counter and was creating a problem with so many people waiting to get pancakes that no one could get to the rest of the hot food. And they weren't worth the wait. There were two toasters and neither of them worked very well. Overall we had a good stay at the Grand Oaks and I would recommend it to others.

They served a 'Hot' & 'Cold' Breakfast with turn-around on keeping tables clean! And during our stay, 2 nights, they were extremely busy. Their Non-Smoking & No Pets Policy was a 'Plus' for us. We both are very allergic to animals & smoke-Their Air is Clean, Crisp & Cool. They all deserve an A+ for maintaining this Policy. Price is fair but they do have additional charges on some amendities; example- to utilize the 'Exercise' Room there is an additional charge: not much. However, their Pool & hot tubs are nice and well maintained, extra towels at front desk. Their was always someone at the front desk, so, no problems. The rooms are clean and the only concern was the small pillows. Internet was a priority for us, this was a business & pleasure trip. They do have computers available in the Lobby and for those who carry Laptops, like us, wireless is available.

We then determined this was something falling from the drop out ceiling, from persons above us walking. Gross! Secondly we had a jacuzzi room, and the controls on the jacuzzi did not work. You could not adjust the pressures coming out of them. The pillows, bedding and comforter smelled like someones body odor. I could clearly tell that the comforter had not been changed or washed for a very long time. The pillows through the pillow cases stunk like sweat and were very flat.

The shower itself had no place to hold soap, shampoo, rag etc. ! This hotel did not even offer complimentary shampoo, lotion and all that we are accustomed too. They had hair shampoo/body soap out of a pump dispenser! The carpetting was stained. The TV's were like antiques with a horrible picture. You can hear all the road noise in your room as if your windows were opened. The hottubs in the indoor pool area, had no handles to grab onto, so getting in and out of there was more than next to impossible. The chlorine level in the pools was phenomenal. You opened your eyes for a second under water outdoor pool, and your eyes began to burn something fierce! You did not even need to go into the water for the indoor pool, for your eyes to burn. You could not sit in that area because the chlorine fumes felt toxic. Lacking seating areas in the rooms as well. Plus you could not even open the windows in the room, to let out some of the stale smell in there. This continental breakfast was a joke. Hardly anything to choose from. The worst of cereals and such. The morning attendant for breakfast is a very rude individual and not nice at all. Talk about being solicited for tips......you have a sign in the room asking you to tip the housekeeping staff, something you may not mind if they did their jobs. Then at the breakfast area, to my surprise, she had a tip jar at the counter. For what? You have to serve yourself!!! The only good thing about this place I can say is the location was ok. But not even that great, because I got a ticket from the Branson PD, for using the center turn lane to turn onto Green Mountain Road. I thought turn lanes were made for turning, but not in Branson. This cost me 90.00 dollars. My family also stayed there too. My parents shower did not drain. My brothers toilet did not drain after he flushed. On the first day, my bathroom sink did not drain after I was done shaving. No one offers to help you with your bags and there is only one elevator, which was slow to say the least. At breakfast they did not even have real creamer for your coffee!! Powdered Creamer!! Come on!! No donuts at breakfast either. Plus the front desk attendant kept making comments in reference to my hair cut which quite frankly I got sick of hearing about!! For $100.00 bucks a night.......I might recommend the Hilton in Downtown or The Radissson up the street. I went through a reservation place who's reviews were misleading to say the least.

The bed was really comfortable and NO bed bugs were found there.

(Our review was submitted for the Branson Tourism Center.) We had booked the Grand Oaks because our relatives were arriving there later in the week. The Grand Oaks was convenient to the Branson Mall, Ruby Tuesday, Wal-Mart, the Moon River Theater, the Moon River Gill, and Panera which all were close enough to walk to. The front desk said because our stay was for 6 nights the front desk arranged for us to have a first floor room, which was extremely convenient to the indoor pool, the 2 whirl pools the fitness center and the guest laundry, ice, soda and ice cream (yes, ice cream) machines were just outside the pool area. We arrived on a Monday afternoon, our reservation was accurate and the room was ready when we checked in and was adequate. This property is not fancy and is older but convenient, clean and we did not see any areas in need of major repair. We had 2 Queen beds, a nice bathroom, and a sink area out side the bathroom. There were no real issues with our room, clean and nicely decorated. The wifi was free and easy to connect but did go out for about a half hour a couple times during our stay. The complimentary breakfast was adequate to get you going, there was on alternate days, biscuits and gravy, eggs, sausage, bacon and your normal fruit, cereal, etc... The only problem we had with the breakfast was toward the latter part of the week when several bus loads of people stayed there. On those days the breakfast area was a bit crowded. On one of those days we went to the Denny's for breakfast (I'll review separately.) We did have an issue with a room next to ours when they were using a very noisy jacuzzi tub running 10 pm, we called the front desk and they were able to contact the occupants and the tub was turned off at 11:30 pm so we were able to get some sleep. We suggested to the front desk that the jacuzzi tub in the next room might need servicing as they usually don't make that much noise. The front desk was very efficient and helpful.

My only complaint (which isn't much of one), is that cont. breakfast is only until 9:30am and I like to sleep later on vacation...don't worry, I still got up for the breakfast! :o) I would definitely stay there again and would, and have already, recommended it to friends!

Only sour note of whole trip was dealing with the Ghost and Haunted Tour people. I had not gotten a pamphlet from them only a phone number. I called to get a reservation. I was only intending to go myself but the young man on the phone told me that I should go ahead and reserve space for the other 3 people and that if they didn't show I would not be charged. Other people in the hotel room heard the conversation. When I arrived at the office for the tour I was told that was not the case but when I explained that to the office manager he told me that he would handle the situation and that \"they would do what he told them to do.\" And of course I had a $60.00 charge on my account when I got home. I called about it and the office manager told me that he had reviewed the case and that the \"young woman\" I talked to (and he provided a name) had told me that I would be charged. When I explained that I had in fact not spoken to a \"young woman\" but had spoken to a young man...he said he needed to check into the matter. Interesting...he had started the conservation of telling me he had already \"checked into the matter\" When he called me back of course it was the same thing that I hadn't been told that at all. He stated that their policy was that if two people had a reseveration and only one showed up they would only be charged for one. But if 3 people had a reseveration and only one showed up they would be charged for the two that didn't show. I managed to get a flyer from someone who had also visited Branson. I looked at the bottom of the flyer and it said all people would be charged if they did not show up for their reservations. That makes sense to me but I did not have the flyer at the time and could only go on what was told me over the phone. If you follow the thread there are actually 3 different stories on how this company charges people for missed reservations. In their response to the Better Business Bureau the company is asserting that I am a wicked person who is trying to get money from an honest company but in the next sentence they said I just didn't understand what I had been told. So they are saying a wicked, evil, and stupid person. I will admit that the young lady who gave the tour understood her material very well and my time with her was enjoyable. It is with regret that I have to say that the company she works for is not an honest company as they assert and they will attack on a personal level if you speak up for your rights.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CAJUN COUNTRY LOUISIANA", "Title": "\u201cBETTER THAN REVIEWS PORTRAY\u201d", "Author": "BERGEAUX", "ReviewID": "UR34728587", "Content": "My family and I visited Branson for our summer vacation.

The front desk advised all of Bldg 2 is non-smoking and I didn't smell a hint of smoke anywhere. They have signs in the rooms that say if you do smoke, they will bill you an extra $250 to sanitize the room when you leave. I think that's a good deterrent!! The bed was comfortable. The only issue we had was that they hide the blanket - it's not on the bed, it's in the drawer?!?!? Although we did not upgrade to the jacuzzi suite, we still had a jetted bathtub. If you want to go swimming, it is an uphill hike to Bldg 1, so we drove instead. The breakfast was decent and served in both buildings. Very close to Wal-Mart, grocery & Panera Bread.

We had two rooms in Building #2. Upon arrival there were already other guests making complaints at the front desk because of overbooking. It should have been a good indication to us to leave. When we made the reservations we requested Non-smoking rooms because of asthma related issues. One room was fine but the other room reeked of smoke. We called the front desk and they moved us to another room. The rooms were average, dirty carpet and uncomfortable beds. The continental breakfast is pretty standard with the other hotels in Branson. Because there are two separate building, there is quite a walk to go to the indoor pool in Building #1 (all up hill). The biggest problem we had was the elevator kept breaking down. With only one elevator in the building it made it very difficult especially since we were on the 3rd floor. We asked if they could accomodate other arrangement for my father because he was disabled and unable to climb stair. They informed us that the elevator breaking was beyond their control. Therefore, my father had to spend one whole day in the room because he was unable to climb the stairs. I thought the managment could have been a little more understanding. Branson is full of hotels, I suggest you try somewhere other than here.
