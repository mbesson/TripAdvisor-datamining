When we walked to our room we realised he tried to put us in a basic room even though we had paid for a superior room. The room was very nice but very small, this didn\u2019t bother us as we weren\u2019t planning on spending much time in there. The shower area is fab, two shower heads and really powerful. We were very happy with the hotel and room we had eventually been given. We left the hotel and found our location to be absolutely perfect, 1 min from the metro, 15 mins walk to the Rambla and plenty of good local bars and restaurants. Then comes the downfall, after a long 1st day sight seeing, eating and drinking sangria we decided to hit the sack. Bed very uncomfortable, every time one of us moved the bed rattled and moved (a lot), the pillows were so wafer thin. I think I had about 9 hours sleep in 3 nights. I came home from this vacation totally shattered. Get some decent beds and get rid of the miserable chap on reception (the rest were absolutely fine!) and you have your self a cracking hotel. All in all a great holiday, just a shame about these couple of points, my advise would be to get a twin room and push beds together so you can get some sleep when you need to.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for your money!\u201d", "Author": "Takemeaway28", "ReviewID": "UR124708268", "Content": "We stayed four nights in Hotel Oasis and were very pleased with the location.

We are not spending too much time in hotel room in our trips so basic room is not an issue for us as long as it\u2019s clean and functional.

Breakfast was not included in room rate, but that\u2019s just fine. There are plenty of places serving breakfast in the neighborhood (as long as you are not fancying very early breakfast). We tried the hotel breakfast as well and it was fine start for your day. Nothing spectacular but ok for that price.

The booking was made via Footballbreak.co.uk as part of a package deal for my two brothers and I to go and see Barcelona play. With flights, a match ticket and 3 nights at the Oasis the whole package came to \u00a3292.00 per person ( excluding transfers). An absolute bargain. However, the trip couldn't have got off to the worst start. Upon arriving at the hotel and being given our ticket envelope, you can imagine my horror at seeing the tickets were for a completely different game next year!!! Whilst this had nothing to do with the hotel, the receptionist on duty Raul was absolutely superb. He called the Spanish agency emergency number and explained the problem and luckily enough he found out that Footballbreak had noted their error before we had arrived and had actually couriered the correct tickets. Checking in to our room we found three single beds as we had requested, a small wardrobe, small plasma screen TV and average sized bathroom with a bath and shower. The room did look dated, lots of scuff marks on the wall, the hairdryer was hanging off the wall but overall it was as we expected for a 2 star hotel. The room was cleaned every day which sometimes you do not get in more star hotels who will only do it once every other day. The one thing I would mention though is the occasional smell of sewage which does come up from the streets and into the hotel rooms. Not sure if this is a hotel problem or just the particular street the hotel is on. We paid for the hotel wifi at 3 euros per day, the connection can fluctuate a bit but for 3 euros again you cant complain really. The shining light of the hotel though is its location. 10 minutes walk to Las Ramblas, 2 minute walk to the metro, five minute walk to the harbour and supermarkets dotted around the area. The night life was still pretty busy even for November but does not kick start until at least 12pm- 1am. Overall for our first trip to Barcelona, we couldnt fault the hotel. The staff were polite enough and there were guests from all over the world staying there which added to a nice cosmopolitan feel to it.

You are also very close to the old town and there is plenty of life around the area of the hotel. We didnt use the hotel for food, so cant comment.

The only glitch was the room she gave me was a smoking twin room facing the busy street outside. Not one wink that night! When i went downstairs to get them to move me (asthmatic for starters, bad back for a single bed as well), she told me that I had to come back the following morning to move. Fine. I did exactly just that and was given in the end a (not so much better) double room on the top floor. Nothing to write home about. Peeling wallpaper, bathroom that smelled of pee, enclosed walls that felt too claustrophobic (no windows) and really bad room throughout. It somehow crossed my mind that the lady who checked me in was doing me a favour. But hey - bad back! But what made me really upset was the staff member that just served me an hour ago. Man, of Filipino descent (or so the accent proclaims) and I simply asked for directions to the nearest internet cafe to print out my boarding pass. He proceeded to give me directions to the \"Pakistani shop\" behind that building (racist much?) and his directions, proclaimed in a very very rude way, couldn\u00b4t help a seasoned traveller.

That desk clerk was not polite or helpful and seemed downright irritated that I was there. When I asked why I was taken to his hotel, he said he didn't know and I would need to ask Hotel Oasis.

I feel cheated. I paid for Hotel Oasis and chose it specifically because it seemed nice, safe, and had wifi (which I really wanted since I would be traveling alone and needed entertainment an communication). What I ended up with was a back alley hotel that had terrible beds, paper thin walls with noisy guest, and crappy customer service. Oh, and a basket of almost rotting apples on the front desk. Gross!

Firstly, let's deal with the issue of the rooms. Yes they are small but perfectly adequate, after all they are only for sleeping in. I've attached some photos of our room and bathroom (which is of greater importance to me than the size of the room). Our room had been renovated to a good standard. The biggest downside for me was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room as we do like to wake up and have tea or coffee to start the day. We didn't book breakfast at the hotel after reading the reviews but we did have breakfast every morning in the small cafe two doors from the hotel entrance, open from 8am. Very friendly staff who guided us to some great little places. The hotel is situated next to Barceloneta Metro stop and there is also a bus stop right outside. Overall, on our experience, the Oasis Hotel is a great budget hotel within easy walking distance of La Rambla, the beach/harbour area and Barri Gotic. I won't go into great detail as other reviewers have already described the location. We did go into the \"bar\" once before we went out one evening but we didn't feel particularly comfortable there and left quite soon. They do serve tapas but we didn't try it. After all said and done, if we do return to Barcelona, we would not hesitate to stay at the Oasis again. Along the way to La Rambla are a few restaurants, try the Sailor restaurant, the food was excellent and the service even better. We had been out for a very full day's sightseeing and just wanted to stay local. If you want a quiet, (very) relaxed meal this is the place. As for Barcelona in general, I highly recommend the hop on hop off bus.

We had stayed at the Tryp Apolo in Barcelona prior to our cruise embarkment and really enjoyed the accomodations there! (Very much what we are used to in the States!) So we were expecting similar accomodations at Hotel Oasis, given they are at similar price-points. However, we were sadly disappointed. Not only was Raoul, the front deskman, lacking personalilty, he couldn't even bring himself to smile upon our check-in. And if we had a question, we felt as if we were putting him out. (Another evening staff member, Narcis, was quite polite, but didn't follow-through with things as we had to come downstairs twice to get an extra pillow and he failed to notify the morning staff of our request for a wake-up call, which almost caused us to miss our morning flight back to New York! Additionally, our taxi was never arranged as he assured it would be. The morning desk woman was, however, very attentive to our needs and did a fine job arranging for a taxi to pick us up and take us to the airport the morning of our check-out.) Our room was spacious for our family of four (parents with two teenagers), but definitely not comfortable with four twin-sized beds, a cold tile floor, a teeny-tiny cheaply renovated bathroom, and a noisy street outside. Granted, the hotel staff cannot help the traffic noise, nor could they help that construction was being done right in front of their hotel, but they could have at least pushed two of the twin beds together for my husband and I and provided enough towels for the four of us to shower. There were no instructions on the plastic telephone in the room on how to reach the front desk (or anywhere else in the hotel), so if you needed anything you had to leave your room, walk downstairs to the lobby, and ask whomever was sitting at the front desk for whatever you needed, be it information or an extra pillow. My parents' room was so hideous, we wondered if \"Candid Camera\" was hiding nearby filming their reaction! (Our room seemed like the Queen of England's quarters in comparison!) The window in their room overlooked a sort of cement courtyard/alley. A \"courtyard\" may sound somewhat charming, but I assure you this one was not. There were no plants or greenery in this courtyard. Just a randomly tossed half-roll of toilet paper. And the only access to it seemed to be via climbing out the window itself! Given that their bathroom overlooked the same creepy \"courtyard\", I suppose if a guest ran out of toilet paper it would be quicker to simply crawl out the window to get that half roll of TP rather than having to tidy up, get dressed, and walk downstairs to the lobby to ask the sole deskman if he could bring you a fresh roll!

This is a budget hotel (2 stars) and it shows the hallmarks of a budget hotel - thin walls, temperamental heating and hot water and in need a of renovation (some paint peeling on the ceiling and walls). The room we stayed in was of a good size and clean. The bathroom was also a good size and clean enough. But as I mentioned earlier - the hotel is in need of a refurbishment. When staying in a budget hotel you can't expect everything to be perfect. In our case it was the peeling paint on the ceiling and walls. This was only in a few places and I'm sure most people can live with this. The heater in the room was warm enough, but the controls seemed to be not working to well. While there was hot water, it took so some to kick in. Once it started there was no problems with the hot water. The hotel was experiencing problems with the hot water on Level 2, so this may have contributed to the slowness of the hot water (we stayed on Level 1). Depending on where in the hotel your room is located, the thin walls may be an issue on 2 fronts: (1) noise from the street and (2) noise from the hallway. The hotel is off a main road. Lots of cars come off the main road to use the street that the hotel is on. Combine this with the thin walls and you have a noisy room. In addition to the traffic, there is construction work next door to the hotel. The construction workers start early. The hallway (as are the rooms) are tiled so noise from people talking and rolling their bags tends to echo in the hallway and into the room. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and very pleasant to talk to. They all speak very good English and were able to give us good tips with our sightseeing questions. The best aspect of this hotel is its location. Just outside Barri Gotic, it is a pleasant walk to Barri Gotic (less than 5 mins) and Las Ramblas (10 mins) via the old laneways of the old city. The tapas bars, restaurants, museums, sights and shops of Barri Gotic are one of the highlights of of Barcelona. The hotel is also close to the waterside area of Barceloneta, where you will find door to door seafood restaurants (great in the warmer months where you can eat outside). The area around the hotel is safe. Even late at night, we did not feel unsafe walking back to the hotel as the road is full of traffic and people walking to the metro station. In terms of transportation, the hotel has great public transport links. It is 2 mins around the corner from Barceloneta Metro station and about 5 mins walk from Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a train station (also known as Barcelona Franca / Barcelona Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a). You can get a train from Barcelona Airport to Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a. You may need to transfer at Barcelona's main train station (Estaci\u00f3 de Sants / Barcelona Sants) for services to Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a. If you are planning to take a few public transport trips during your stay in Barcelona, at the Airport train station make sure you buy a T-10 ticket for EUR 7.70. It allows travel all over Barcelona on the Metro, trains, buses, trams. It is great value for money if you are travelling to the sights around Barcelona - which are all accessible by a great Metro system. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a basic hotel with a good location and helpful staff, but you should ask for a quieter room (maybe close to the back of the hotel?)", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location to train station, reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "swintontraveller", "ReviewID": "UR26168055", "Content": "We stayed here for one night after a cruise, arrived at the hotel at 10am and knew we wouldn't be able to check in 'til later but it wasn't a problem as there was a secure room to store your luggage,just remember to take your valuables.

Museums and galleries tend to be closed on Mondays, we were there on a Monday. We had room 317, one of the older rooms but it was perfectly adequate for one night. It was on an internal corridor so no views, advantage of this was no noise from the road. The room was quite large , plenty of space. We did walk past 315 when the door was open and it was TINY, no room hardly to walk around the double bed !!

I wonder how much the prices will go up once the renovations are finished ! We took the train to the airport from the Franca station around the corner. We were in Barcelona in Jan and checked out doing this then. You no longer can get a train direct to the airport from Franca station, you have to change at Estacion de Sants or Gracia. If you do this I recommend you change at Gracia as there are only 2 platforms and you literally get off one train, stay on the platform and wait for the airport train. It wasn't difficult and we had one large suitcase each with hand luggage . There is a small supermarket across the road from the Franca train station main entrance if you need any provisions, water etc. I could find no faults with this hotel.

Here are the direction which I have expanded a bit from the ones I had. Get from Estacio de Franca to the hotel as follows: Turn left after exiting the station. Follow the sidewalk for less than 5 minutes, then turn left on Pla De Palau. The Oasis Hotel is at 17. We were told by the nice person at the front desk that check-in would not be until after 1 pm, but they had a luggage room we could use, so we left our bags there and set off to explore the Gotic area of Barcelona, just a few blocks away, for a few hours. When we returned our room was ready. So grabbed our bags and headed up on the elevator to our 4th floor room. Although quite small, our room had a very comforable queen-sized bed, large with lots of storage room, and a lovely glass door bath with granite counter top and raised bowl sink. Very up-to-date and obviously newly redocorated. Because we had virtually no sleep for almost 24 hours, we took short, less than two hour nap. then proceeded to head to the Picasso Museum just a coupler blocks from the Oasis and then a delightful early dinner/ late lunch at Teller Tapas restaurant. After that we took a nice stroll to the Park de la Ciutadella and enjoyed seeing Barcelona's own Arc de Triomf which was created for the 1888 Great Exhibition of Barcelona. After a very good night's sleep we thoroughly enjoyed the included breakfast buffet at the Oasis before leaving for a couple hours walk along the waterfront and then up Las Ramblas to Placa Catalunya and back.

The room was very outdated in style with a pathetic excuse for a shower that flooded the whole room. The 2nd floor I was on looked like something out of a ropey 1970s hall of residence in the UK, or a prison. I guess I could have moved but I'd paid in full up front and didn't want to lose the money. I could have complained but the service on the front desk was so listless that I doubted it would make any difference at all - and perhaps my fault for not speaking good enough spanish. Bascially this hotel was so bad it was funny. The ONLY good thing was the location as it was a few minutes to the beach and right round the corner from the station where you can get a direct train from the airport so for me travelling on my own, very easy to get around.

The comments seemed to run in two extremes- glowing and bad. People liked it a lot, and had nothing but great things to report, or they did not have a good experience, which was also reported. Unfortunately, our experience fell in line with many of the experiences listed by the latter. Our Room For us a hotel is strictly utilitarian. Its a place to hang our hats at night. We do not book high end accommodations and we have little expectation of grand amenities. We stayed at the Oasis mid February 2008, and the room was stuffy-no just plain hot! The air conditioning did not work and a fan was already in the room. It did nothing but push the warm stale air. The room did have a window, but it opened to an air well that was capped on the roof. In order to sleep we rigged the door, so we were safe while it was ajar. This allowed for heavenly fresh air circulation. We wondered what this room would be like in the summer, uggg. Being energy conscious, the hotel had a motion sensor for the light in the hallway of the location of our room. The lights went on and off all night long. This was odd because our room was on a wing with only one other room, and it was vacant. Yep, you guessed it-a Rat!!!! Breakfast We booked through Hotels.com, and a major selling point for the Oasis was that our booking included breakfast. If it did not, we would have gone elsewhere. We were only in Spain for two weeks and wanted to get out and see the country not hunt down restaurants for morning coffee and toast. We got our meal tickets for days one and two-no problem. We simply went to the desk and the Manager handed them to us. No talk of room number or money. The third day we went to the desk and a different clerk asked us for 8.90\u20ac a piece ($24.48). All we said that breakfast was included in our package. To which he shot out of his chair and said \u201cI only work here, you must talk to the manager.\u201d We later had a giggle about this guy\u2019s dramatic performance. We spoke to the manager the next morning; he crossed his arms and shook his head and said \u201cno\u201d then turned his back on us to do something else. We let it go, until we could take the issue up with Hotels.com, the company who took our money. Upon check out the manager tried to charge us for the first two days worth of breakfast. We told him it was included and had him look it up on Hotels himself. He let the issue go, by again folding his arms, shaking his head no, and walking away. Scary. We went on to Madrid for our second week in Spain. Our Opinion The amount we paid for our room at the Hotel Oasis, was well in line with all of the surrounding hotels. We are not spoiled American tourists with expectations of grandeur when it comes to a room. We stay in hotels so we can see the World not a hotel, but we also do not expect to get a room too hot to sleep, see rats and experience the old bait and switch!

Metro stop is next door, Estacio de Franca is around the corner and the Marinas are just up the street (but not the cruise port - it's a short cab ride away). A few of the staff are down right surly, but the few that shine make it tolerable. It is a very noisy place. Don't expect english on the TV - just CNN and maybe a sports channel.

While in a small square where cafe tables were set up for a couple of restaurants, a guy approached and said something was all over the back of my jacket and pants. From what I could see it looked like vomit (or worse) and when he offered to wash it off (in the restroom of the restaurant) I let him lead me there. While brushing whaterver it was, he was expertly checking all the usual spots where tourists think they can cleverly hide their wallets from crooks. My wallet was in a zipped pockets in the lining of my jacket. Within 2 minutes of his departure I realized my wallet was lone gone and so was the crook. It took me about 15 minutes to walk to the police station and the very first thing they had me do was to call the credit card companies. In just that short period of time, the crook had managed to charge over $1,000 to one of my cards!!! A little advice..... Keep a record of your credit card numbers in a seperate place.

The bathroom was very small. There was mildew everywhere on the shower stall. The door was also very thin therefore I heard everything when someone talking in the hallway. Unfortunately, there other young travelers, it got very loud. The room was very appalling. Granted that it was a two star establishment, it really was beyond my belief when I first saw it.

Service: The folks at front desk were always nice and friendly for the most part. The same can be said about folks at the breakfast buffet. Regarding the breakfast buffet, choices were very limited. I had toast and jam everyday. There were hard-boiled eggs. There was also salad, something I thought was rather odd. Salad for breakfast? There were cold cuts. However, there was no fruit of any kind. The OJ was very diluted. I think it was just water and some yellow color they put in.

I want to write this rewiew for all travellers looking for where to stay in Barcelona and for who reserved it already. If honestly, choosing this hotel, i came from the price and from the location (just took a Barcelona map, marked where airport bus arrives at the city and where the main sights in the city) - Oasis was the best from every point of view. We paid only 39 euro per night for whole double, yes yes, for 2 persons (probably it was not a season and we didnt take a breakfast, i love to sleep as more as possible after night adventures :-))) For these money i waited for to see the awful hotel, how could i imagined, but ... Everything was not so bad! Take a look on my photos and you will understand yourself, i made everything i could (all photos will be in 2 reviews, coz i want to show everything). During we stayed at the hotel, reception place wasnt finished, so i can only suggest how it can be now. All receptionist were men (different ages!!! what is really strange for me, i used to young smiley girls :-))) Apropos, it was first hotel, which i reserved online, so i wanted to have not only site confirmation, but also hotel confirmation, so i wrote there a letter, but i didnt get an answer, and i tried to call to hotel, they said they havent any information about my reservation, i was a little bit in shock. But when we arrived, showed printed confirmation of reservation, everything was ok, receptionist just asked one passport and gave a card. I want to notice, rooms at the last floor have card keys, and at the lower floor usual keys with this awful thing which make you to stay it at the reception when u leave hotel. So i advice you to ask highest rooms if it will be possible. When we opened door, we saw a picture absolutely like on site photo, no surprises. Yes, it`s enough little, but for these money .... Everything looked clean, just i felt a smoke smell, i`ve called to the reception, asking could i have non-smoker room. they apologized saying that they dont have a room division for smoker and non-smoker. So it`s one of minuses. Bed linen is absolutely fresh and clean. Servise is daily, not importunate, i didnt notice them. If you put towels at the floor, they change it, if not, only clean. Also you have shower-gel every day (not luxurious sure, but dont forget hotel is pozitioned like 2 stars). There was some bruises at the walls of bathroom from hot water, but not criminal. And also one broken little part at the edge of the bath, but it was tidy painted over with white colouring (photos of this you can see in my second reveiw). About food i can not say anything, we didnt take it, just can say you can take good swedish table with normal choise and even glass of wine for 8 euro till the lunch time, and for 10 euro after, almost everywhere in the city. So you choose there! And now about the main preference of this hotel after its` price - it`s location of course. It`s on 5+++. Entrance to the metro - 50m. Bus stop - right near doors of hotel, and some else around, depends of direction. Stop of Barcelona bus (bus for traveller, which has stops near every sight in the city) - in 50 m from hotel. La Rambla is in 2 street`s crosses. Port (where is concentrated all night life) and beaches - probably this hotel is on the best location for them. So in summary: if you dont want to spend money for staying, if you are not going to spend 90% ur time in hotel, if you want to be in the center of all events - choose this hotel. If i will travel next time with the same amount of finances i will choose the same hotel without any doubt. Wish you nice holidays in Barcelona.

The room was small and basic, but the bed linen, towels, bath and sink were clean. The bathroom floor looked clean but had a squashed cockroach in the corner so obviously hadn't been mopped. The beds were comfortable, the TV worked, if you could be bothered the fiddle on with it, and the air con worked, although it did make a buzzing sound every now and again. Breakfast was ok - toast, bread rolls, croissants, ham, salami, cheese, cornflakes, fruit and yogurt - and the breakfast area and bar are nicely decorated and clean. The staff on reception are polite enough but not very helpful and a couple ofthem spoke poor english. All in all this hotel was ok - for \u00a325 a night I couldn't complain.

I agree with the previous reviewer about Octopus Travel - they provide very flattering photos of this hotel. The hotel was being refurbished but we were given an old room which was filthy and worn. The hotel staff said the refurbished rooms were all booked even though we booked the hotel 5 months previous and never saw more than half a dozen other guests in the hotel. The room had the smallest window I've ever seen (with a view of the neighbouring wall), we had the opposite problem with the radiator in the fact that it wouldn't turn off, so the heat in the room was unbearable! (Don't expect air conditioning) Our room was next to the elavator - the noise of the elavator throughout the night was like a pneumatic drill in the head, then the cleaners started hoovering at around 6.30am. Nice. The hotel staff were completely uninterested in any problems - we even spoke to the hotel manager who told us to contact Octopus Travel as he held no responsibility (!), and when we contacted Octopus Travel, guess what - we were told to complain to the hotel manager. A filthy hell-hole, I would pay a lot extra to stay at a better hotel next time, as Barcelona is a great city.

After reading two of the previous reviews for April I was very worried about this booking as my 70 year old (though fairly fit) sister was accompanying my husband and myself. However we were pleasantly surprised when we got to our rooms. Our double room (third floor) was quite small but very clean and comfortable with air con (which did work if you tried) TV, phone, nice bathroom with hair dryer and large make up mirror, soap, shampoo. Plenty of clean white towels. Our bed was clean and comfortable. My sister was on the floor below and her twin room was larger and she had absolutely no complaints considering what we had paid for the trip. We had been informed that there was an ongoing refurbishment programme and the lift would not be in use. However the service lift would be in operation, hence my sister being on a lower floor. Our rooms were the Superior or Comfort rooms and had obviously been newly refurbished. Not sure if the intention is to refurbish and upgrade all the hotel rooms. I think it would be a good idea as the only complaint we had was that there was no safety deposit box ( we left our money and passports in the Reception safe) and we would have liked a brighter bedside lamp for reading at night. Breakfast was the usual continental type breakfast which we thought was adequate and there was also a tapas/bar and restuarant. We ate out but did have a couple of drinks each night in the bar. This hotel is only about a ten minute stroll from La Ramblas and lots of other attractions and right next door to the metro. The railway station is also round the corner though we didn't realise this till later and took a taxi from the airport. About 23 euros, so split three ways was far easier way to get direct to your hotel. Walls probably are quite thin but I think this is the same in most 2/3 star hotels, certainly the ones we have stayed in in Paris and Amsterdam. The only noise we heard was the cleaner in the morning which we didn't have a problem with as it was about time to get up anyway and also the noise of running water from toilet and showers above and below. First morning I did think it was water running down the wall but after that didn't really notice it. All in all we had a wonderful break with lovely warm weather. For a 2 star hotel we were very happy with the standard and location of the hotel. All the staff were fine and tried to be helpful. We would have no hestitation in staying at the Oasis again if/when we go back to Barcelona.", "Date": "May 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cNot Awful - would definately stay again\u201d", "Author": "heather92282", "ReviewID": "UR3430399", "Content": "This hotel definately isn't the nicest hotel we came across while visiting Barcelona, but was far from the worst. It seemed that we either came across REALLY nice hotels (which were also very expensive) or REALLY gross hotels (which were really cheap) - Hotel Oasis was one of the only hotels we came across which was somewhere in the middle. It was perfect for my friend and I who did not want to spend a fortune on a room but wanted it to be at least decent. You get a good price for the area, with an incredible location, right next to a metro, 5 minute walk from the beach, perfect distance from las ramblas... The breakfast buffet they have was okay - nothing special though. The rooms were pretty tiny but clean. Just a warning - they are in the process of doing a lot of work on the hotel now - so there is a lot of contruction going on - but it did not really bother us. If you plan to be in the room during the day and like quiet - you may want to keep this in mind. One more thing to note - the room with a balcony isnt really a balcony - we had trouble getting the window open to be honest. The one thing we really were not happy about, was that our phone had been torn out of the wall and was just sitting on the nightstand broken. We asked several times for this to be fixed and nothing was ever done about it. Our wake up call in the morning became a wake up pound on the door. When we went downstairs to ask to use their phone at one point to make a local call - we were told no. We were pretty angry about that... Overall, I would stay here again. For someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a room, but is not up to braving a hostel - this hotel is a good choice.
