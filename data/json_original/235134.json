Each time I encountered no problems. I am a 23 year old college student. Booked this trip as a getaway to Los Angeles. The room and bathroom were decent in size. As with most trips, I didn't spend a lot of time in my room. Don't count on any type of view. If you are on the top floor, you \"may\" actually get a glimpse of the Hollywood sign. I could almost see it on the 2nd floor, but there were trees/buildings in the way. The staff is friendly. I've read in some posts that it is in a \"so-so\" area of Hollywood. I can see where it may get a little sketchy late night. I didn't have any problems the times I was visiting. It is 2 blocks south from the Western/Hollywood metro rail. It's easy access to Hollywood/Highland area and downtown. There is a 24hr Walgreens next to it, and a McDonald's. For those who come back from the bar, and need to satisfy their appetite, there is actually a Subway open till 3am and a late night Denny's a few blocks West on Sunset. Both are in walking/stumbling distance. I highly recommend! The continental breakfast is okay - Better than most! They usually have muffins and doughnuts. I think they actually had cereal at one point. They have their own orange juice dispenser that I thoroughly enjoyed when I was hungover from partying the night before. (The best stuff ever! I couldn't get enough.) Like I said, it is conveniently located near the metro. Easy access the highland. I didn't have a car while I was out there - so I quickly became familar with the public transportation. A few blocks south of Sunset is Santa Monica Blvd. You can take the bus West to Santa Monica. It is about a 30-45 minute ride to the beach. I would recommend this hotel to others my age if you are just looking for a place to crash while you enjoy Los Angeles.

That's a good price compared to what other hotels in the area are charging. The review: - Parking: You get free parking beside the hotel in a well-lit parking lot. I felt safe leaving our rental car there. Great because this is a shady part of Sunset Blvd. - Free Wireless Internet: Nice touch. - Room: The hall was smelly and dimly lit. As we opened the door to our room, I new we had made a mistake. It smelt like sweat and cigarette - seriously - very strong odour! A bad combo. The pillow cases had sweat stains on them, and the sheets were also stained with obvious signs of 'wear and tear'. A few 'hairs' here and there also on the white sheets. I opened the window to air out the room. The bathroom was clean, nothing special, and towels were paper thin. The entire room could just use some refurbishing and freshening up. The main issue though was the smell of sweat. It was as if it was stuck in the walls. My wife and I looked at each other and said 'oh well, it's only for a night' and went to a local restaurant for some eats. On our way back we were both dreading the room and strongly considered checking out for something more tolerable, but decided to just chalk it up as an experience. - Continental Breakfast Included: Cereal, warm milk, watery coffee... what can I say. We could see the HOLLYWOOD sign from our room, which was a surprise bonus, but this room was not what we were used to staying in. I would pay a little more and stay at one of the many motels a little west of this hotel on Sunset Blvd. This is a very last resort hotel. The pics on the internet of this hotel are very deceiving - they must have been taken 15 years ago when the hotel was brand spanking new because that IS NOT what the rooms look like. It's not the worst place in the world to stay, but it was tough to swallow. As the old saying goes, you get what you pay for - it rings true at this Super 8. The next day we checked into a $300/night hotel and it felt like walking into heaven when we opened the door to that room!

I booked this hotel on the company's website. The pictures shown are nothing like the actual hotel! This hotel was located in a very shady neighborhood. There was a strip joint right next door and I also saw several hookers infront of our hotel! I agree with the previous review, this is not some place I would want to be even in daylight, let alone at night. Very scary area. That aside, the elevator they have is very, very slow and it felt as if it would break down any minute. There were stains all over the walls and carpets, not just in our room, but also along the dark hallways. Our bed sheets had weird stains, and the comforter had holes. Our room was supposed to be non-smoking, but it smelled very musty in our room. The toilet seat was falling to one side and the bathroom vent didn't work. When I complained at the front desk, the employee was not friendly and he did not seem to care. He didn't apoligize and he didn't move us to another room. He claimed that they didn't have any more rooms available, and he had a smirk on his face. The next day when I talked to the manager, she was able to move us to a better room, but even then the room wasn't much better. All of the windows outside their rooms have bars. At one point I had to question whether this was a prison or a hotel? I tried booking another room in the area, called all the hotels I could find, but they were all booked -- otherwise we would have been out of there the first day. It's been a few months and I still cringe when I think about how awful that motel was, it's beyond belief. I would never, ever stay there again, not even if they gave me a free night there.

It is definitley not a nice area to be in, I being a female would have been scared to walk around even in the daytime if my boyfriend had not been there, and wouldn't even think about venturing out at night. The room itself was ok, big bed, tv with lots of channels. The front desk staff were fairly friendly but were not very informed about things such as the \"high speed internet in every room.\" As computer literate people we went downstairs to see about a password, no password and no help offered either only the computer downstairs which charged $10 for 10 minutes and the in the lobby which smells like indian food.

The lobby smells really funny like 3 people were cooking 3 different meals. The elevator is really old and a piece of crap that takes 2 or 3 minutes to get from the 4th floor to the lobby. The maintenance guy is creepy. Looks like a creepier Neil Young. The room I stayed in was about a 2/10. It was fairly big but had an old TV, funny smells, bad fluorescent lighting, weird funky holes in the ceiling, stains on the walls, and various unknown stains splattered all over the bathroom wall - don't ask. The girl the front desk is nice - but they generally don't know much and can't guide you on anything. The breakfast is terrible - stale gross donuts and bad coffee/juice.

I spent 4 nights there - Monday 3/15/04 to Friday 3/19/04. I originally selected this place because it had a refrigarator in the room. \"Great,\" I thought, I can save money by buying sandwiches instead of going to a resturant. Sure enough the room had a refrigarator, a 2.1 cu ft \"bar\" model, which preformed like a champ. Too bad there were several other things that were less than optimal. The motel lists cable TV as one of its perks. Unfortunately half the cable channels were out of order when I was there, downcheck. The Queen bed was like sleeping on a steel shelf or a monk's rock bed. I mean sure some people like a firm mattress, but this was beyond firm, to the point of being more like a mideval torcher device, downcheck. The room WAS soundproof. A good thing too because it was right next door to an active construction site, with +90 db noise from 6am to after sunset. Thank God for sound proofing. Up Check. There are three supermarkets, including a Ralph's and a Food 4 Less within two blocks of the motel, and there is a Sav-On drugstore a half block away. Easy to stock the refrigarator. Up check. But the worst thing was there was NO radio reception there. There was a clock radio in the room and I had brought my own boombox. Both AM and FM bands were wiped out with a loud 60 Hz buzz. Maybe from construction site.

You can access the internet in the lobby for a fee, pretty cheaply I believe. Oh and they don't have real milk for coffee - just a jar of powdery white stuff instead.
