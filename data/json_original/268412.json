We stayed at this hotel with the truck club. I thought after reading all the reviews on this website that this place would be great! Well, was I surprised. They have no front help after 10pm, so if you need anything after that you are out of luck. The housekeeping leaves at 4pm, so if you need them after that, the front desk person has to take care of it. Because they are the only one there you wait forever to get what you need or you just dont get it. We had no blanket on our bed and when I went down to get one she couldn't find any. She did finally find me one and it had so many holes in it and smelled so bad like cigarette smoke that we didn't even use it. Our ice bucket had a crack in it, no big deal, just go get another one right? Well about 5 hours after I asked I had to go back to the front desk to finally get it and guess what another cracked ice bucket!! I gave up after that! I received a smoking room after I was told when I made the reservation that if would be nonsmoking. They advertise a \"Deluxe Continental Breakfast\" guess again!!! Breakfast was pretty bad and not deluxe! You have to pay extra if you want a microwave or fridge. I haven't been to a hotel in 10 years that doesn't already have that in the room. The beds are new, but very hard. The free wi-fi only worked 10% of the time. Bathrooms and vanity area need to be remodeled, no coffee maker, iron or blow dryer in room.

The owner was onsite everyday of our stay- he had introduced himself upon check-in and even helped out with our luggage to the room- I asked him about the Marine Corp flag(there was also a American flag) that was flying out front; he responded that he is still active in the reserves! I shook his hand and thanked him for his service. Breakfast was just as advertised; continental breakfast with 3 types of cereal, bagels, toast,muffins, milk, coffee, apple and orange juices, I believe also some type of fruits, and a good assortment of donuts. We were late risers one morning and they still had enough to accomodate us around 9am. Checkout was fast and easy and got a itemized statement detailing billing. Some PROS to this hotel: very friendly staff, clean-comfortable rooms, breakfast provided, nice pool, creek runs directly behind hotel, great nightly rates, hotel was completely full- but never once was disturbed by other patrons, front desk and owner extremely helpful with directions around branson to avoid the traffic jams, free wireless internet from your room. Some CONS to this hotel: I can honestly say that we never experienced any cons what-so-ever. Some attractions that we took part in during our stay: Ride the Ducks Table Rock, Ripleys believe it or not, Wax Museum, Tanger outlet malls(horrible traffic), Bransons Landing, WhiteWater waterpark, Fish Hatchery free tour below the damn, Moonshine Beach, Legends of Rock(michael jackson, alan jackson, little richard, elvis, etc) at the AMC. and last= the best day on Table Rock with one of my dear friends and his family boating and cliff jumping, jumping off rope swings, swimming etc...he really knows the meaning of the word PALS! We will definitely be making this a annual trip and we will stay no where else but Fall Creek Inn.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cNot the worst; not the greatest either.\u201d", "Author": "disneylover65", "ReviewID": "UR75105389", "Content": "We were looking for an inexpensive and quick road trip and found this hotel on Expedia where we got three nights for the price of two which made it under $60/night.

Traffic, however, was terrible on the weekend and it took us an hour to travel the short distance from our hotel to the strip the first morning (not the hotel's fault). Beds are the typical not-very-comfortable ones that come at this price range. Pillows seemed worn and somewhat lumpy. If you're just looking for a basic, cheap room, this will fit the bill. However, I wouldn't stay there again for the following reasons: First, there was ZERO hot water when we showered at 9am Sunday morning. The place was totally full on Saturday so I assume there just wasn't enough to keep up. Monday and Tuesday mornings were fine because there weren't as many hotel guests those days. Second, the continental breakfast is one of the worst I've experienced lately - a very limited variety of cheap donuts, generic cereal, bagels and canned fruit cocktail. Third, the pool which is outdoors (actually what we wanted in the hot, summer weather) is very tiny and only has 3 lounge chairs so don't plan on laying out and catching any rays.

Nothing that really bothered us though. The room keys are not swipe cards; they are actual keys. And the doors lock automatically when shut so be careful not to lock yourself out.

We were careful to make sure the door was locked when we left and didn't have any problems. There's a nice little picnic area in back of the hotel by the creek where you can grill out.

We put up a blanket and that solved the problem. Otherwise, it was a great stay. I've included some pictures that I took.

But, they were really, really noisy and were up all hours of the night. The walls at this hotel were paper thin. We paid $100/night to stay in a jacuzzi room. The suite was right next to the swimming pool on the ground floor. Who ever heard of such a thing. I repeatedly complained about the noise. The staff was very unhelpful. The only thing they did was say they were sorry. We checked out the morning of the last night. The staff said they were giving us $10 off per night that we said, but they lied because after I looked at the receipt and did the math... they did no such a thing. We are very, very unhappy with this hotel and we will never stay here again. I hope others look at this review and consider whether or not they should stay here.

We had a time working with the reservation agents w/ the hotel. They didn't seem to know rates, or dates. Luckily I was very prepared; I have worked in the travel industry and booked many a hotel room in my day. I booked our room months in advance, the evening I made the reservation about 11:00 pm we received a phone call wanting to know why we had not checked in. I explained to them the next morning I they had made a mistake we were not set to check in until 7/29/06. They apologized and guaranteed me the rate I had been quoted, after several calls to double check the reservation the manager finally had to assure the rate. Which the rate in my opinion was very high for what you get. The room was VERY clean, no complaints there. But it was very small, possibly the smallest room I have ever stayed in. When we first entered the room we were over whelmed with the smell of cigarette smoke. Even the extra bedding stunk of smoke. We quickly turned on the air and I didn't notice the smell much after that. The Jacuzzi was the very best part of the room; I would have been totally disappointed if it hadn't been for the Jacuzzi. It was very large, a 2 person if not larger, and like I said before everything was very clean. The Fall Creek Steakhouse was excellent. We had a short wait but it was totally worth it. Great food and atmosphere. Rudy, the roll tosser had a great time with the kids, and the rolls are wonderful. All in all our experience was average; I think that the nightly rates are a little high for what you get. IF YOU CALL TO MAKE YOUR RESERVATION please be sure to WRITE DOWN WHO YOU TALK TO.

I can't believe we are talking about the same motel! No rooms were available with the discounted rate, so we had to pay $65. TOO MUCH!

Someone canceled and we got our room. The room was very small and NO extras at all. Just beds (NO BLANKET! just a sheet and bedspread), TV and table. There was no coffee pot, blow dryer, luggage rack, or even cups or soap. The towels were stained and ratty. The pool is very small, and the picnic area is just a gravel pad with 2 tables. Nothing like it is talked up to be. The creek was stagnant green water, but the weeds were so high you couldn't even see it. The ads I seen said high speed internet, but it failed to mention you have to PAY for it! It is $5 for 30 minutes. The staff was not friendly at all, almost to the point of being nasty. It concerns me they profess this to be a Christian run motel and they can't even respond to a \"good morning!\" : ( The breakfast was your very basic continental.

Now, the creek is probably dry by this time of the year, but they had a grassed area and some picnic tables with several grills you can use.
