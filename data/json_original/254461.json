We took advantage of their rain spa with a couples massage...best decision ever! The massage therapists we had were friendly and wonderful! We also used the Hammam after which is a like a giant sauna. We also ordered room service our first night-ordered burgers...no joke, best burgers we have ever had!!! The cheese was amazing...yum!

They had classical music playing in our room when we arrived. We enjoyed it so much, we never turned it off! The room service was speedy as well. Well, for a bucket of ice anyway :) We opened a bottle of bailey's in the room for a little pre-party one night and they quickly responded to our request for ice. The only negative I have is the size of the room. We had just a standard room, which was fine for our quick weekend getaway. But, if you have a lot of luggage, it will be VERY tight. We had to stick our 2 suitcases in nooks and crannies in the room just to get around. But, I suppose this should be expected in such an old, unique hotel. My brother and sister in law upgraded their room to a King/corner room and they had MUCH more space. So just something to keep in mind if you are a heavy packer! There is a wardrobe to store you clothes. Last but not least, make sure you look over your bill before you leave. We were charged things out of our mini bar that we never had. So just be aware!

The hotel offers a complimentary drink upon check in, which is a nice perk. We stayed in the bar to have additional cocktails before dinner and was bet pleased. Unlike the bar, AIX restaurant was very empty. Food was amazing nonetheless. Rainspa was average. The steam room (hammam) was really nice, but locker rooms were insufficient. Women's locker rooms are on another floor of the hotel (also where hotel rooms are) so they make you walk with a robe and take the elevator from one floor to the next. This I didn't enjoy. Men's locker rooms don't exist at all...simply some lockers in the hallway of the spa. Locker rooms were also lacking in ameneties for a spa. Luckily, because we stayed in the hotel, we used our amenities in our room and skipped the lockers. The couples' massage was really nice though...and we got a discount coupon upon check in!

We requested an early check in by email and received a response within 24 hours that they would try their best to accomodate our request. Upon arriving at the hotel, almost 2 hours before check in, we were greeted by Nicholas and we were happy to see our request was met. He also let us know that for a small fee, we could upgrade to either a king room for $20.00/day or to a junior suite with a king bed, fireplace, jacuzzi tub and balcony for $35.00/day. I asked to see the rooms and Nicholas was extremely pleasant, giving us a tour of the hotel, explaining the history and the different additions to the hotel. We loved the jr suite he showed us and didnt think twice about upgrading. The room was twice the size of the standard room we had booked, with a brick wall running through the bedroom to the ensuite. A huge kingsize bed, a lovely sitting area, with wall unit that had a flatscreen tv over the electric fireplace, and floor to celing windows that lead to a balcony made up the room.The bathroom was beautiful. It was spacious, with a large walkin in rainshower, a stand alone jacuzzi tub for 2, with a tv and sink and vanity. Bathrobes included. We fell in love with the room immedidately! We received a card for 2 free drinks in the lounge Suite 701 which we used after a day of shopping (value $22.00), which in our minds made up for the $25.00 cost for valet parking. We had a great night at the hotel and just loved the atmosphere, the surroundings and the helpful and friendly staff. When we got up the next morning, we were dismayed to find that we had no hot water for a shower before leaving for breakfast. We called down and were told it may take up to an hour for the problem to be fixed, so we requested a complimentary room service breakfast be sent up and the gentleman at the front desk didnt hesitate for a second and told us to give our order to room service and it would be on the hotel. Breakfast arrived and it was fantastic!

The first time was in a regular room, this time in a junior suite. The first thing I could say is \"what's the difference?\" For the extra 10 feet of living room, we were paying about $10 per foot extra. The hotel is beautiful. It is a refurbished military building (last century), lots of exposed brick, high ceilings, big windows (that open), and stunning bathrooms that rival European hotel rooms in size. There is a fantastic restaurant in the hotel on the lower level as well as a stunningly beautiful bar at street level. Take heed though, this bar gets going on weekends and we have heard that you don't want a room over top of the bar if you are a light sleeper. This time around we were blessed with beautiful weather and the rooftop bar was open. It was a great spot to chillax in the afternoon after a day of walking through town. We didn't go, but it must be gorgeous at night. Upon arrival guest are given a coupon for two complimentary drinks. These are not for premium drinks and can only be used at the lobby bar. The restaurant is great value for the quality of food and the service is outstanding. Both times we stayed in building three and highly recommend it, although we never stayed \"on the other side\". Our junior suite had a beautiful jet tub and a shower you could park a Harley in. I thought the rain head was just a gimmick....it was lovely. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 was since we came last year, the hotel is looking a tad run down.

We picked the Place D'Armes hotel based on a recommendation from Gilt Groupe/Jetsetter.com and we were quite impressed. Location: Best place to be if you want to be in old Montreal. It's right by the Church as well as the waterfront. Hotel: When we arrived the register guy was super friendly and nice. The hotel is a conglomerate of 3 huge old buildings, each has a separate elevator but connect in the lobby. The lobby itself was quite nice and huge considering it's 3 buildings however, it's split into separate rooms and areas so you don't realize how big it is until you walk through it all. The main lobby has a waiting area and there is delicious ice tea available for free. There is also a bar connected to a restaurant (we didn't go) as well as a billiards room which was empty. We stayed in the middle building facing uptown/Chinatown. We had a pretty good size room (we're from NYC so room size is relative to what we get here!) and a great bathroom. Wifi worked well and was free (a plus). Huge flat screen TV with surround sound speakers (although I couldn't figure out how to work them), DVD player, etc. A lot of lamps in the room which was great. Super comfortable king size bed. It was clean and well appointed. The only minus was you can't open the windows - I like fresh air and don't like breathing recycled air. The room was quiet, too. Bathroom was spacious with a huge shower for 2. I would have liked 2 shower heads since it was so big. Bathroom was a tad dark so it was hard to see when getting ready. Great towels.

Once we were there with our four ways on, they whisked our car away, and we were welcomed into the lobby, which is not grand like the major chains, but modern and sleek. The desk staff was kind and checked us in early without a problem. Our room was on the 4th floor, facing the street. This is a boutique hotel, so the layout is not your typical mega-chain layout, its intimate and inviting. The elevators are small, but luckily it wasnt busy. This hotel is in a PERFECT location in Old Montreal. Right next to the metro Place D'Armes for easy access to all parts of Montreal, but literally right accross the street from Notre-Dame Cathedral, which is beautiful and has very nice concerts at times. Its about a 5min walk to the Old Port, which is picturesque this time of year. Our room was a king size room, with a nice big flat screen tv, rain shower, robes, fully stocked mini-bar, ipod docking station, and a nice table and chairs by the window. The space was clean, and our housekeeper left us a bottle of water and some lindt chocolates. We bought our own snacks for dinner, and ate them in the room, but there wasnt any cutlery or plates, so I called down to get some delivered to the room, which was done in less than 5 minutes. We could not hear anything from any of the other rooms, it really felt like we were the only ones in the hotel! We also didnt see too many other people. We pumped up the music in our room for our girl's night out, and no one complained :) We also had a welcome cocktail included in our package, and we enjoyed that at the bar. The bar was fairly empty, but such is life on a weekday. My drink was a fresh basil and raspberry martini, which was delicious and refreshing! After a night on the town, we crashed in our king size bed and I slept like a log! Lots of pillows too. I called down to reception in the morning and they gave us a 2 pm checkout without a problem, nice. We visited the RainSpa, which they say is a turkish hammam, but it wasnt that great. It was a nice treat after a night out on the town, but it was just a steam room, no baths or hot tub or anything. I wouldnt pay full price to go to it...

The stay started badly. I arrived in the evening around 9.30 pm. I made the mistake of taking the airport bus into town even though I had two pieces of luggage. I had overshot the stop nearest the hotel and got lost. I found myself in a well known square (Place Jacques Cartier) and called the hotel on my mobile phone, which was running out of power. Despite my giving the name of the square I was on and describing my location, it took some time for the third person I got on the phone to give me directions. I only got to hear the first part of her instructions before my phone died. Once I arrived at the hotel, somewhat exhausted, I found it strange that there was nobody at the front to help with luggage or even just hold open the door. I got to the registration desk. There were two people there. The younger fellow checked me in but he seemed somewhat distracted as he did so. The check-in process went on somewhat longer than I thought it would. I then asked about items that were in the package that I had booked. The gentleman was confounded. He said he knew nothing about a package. I asked specifically about the Montreal Museum Pass. Again, he knew nothing. He asked his colleague, who similarly said he did not know anything about this special package. I suggested they check the hotel's own website to see the various items in this package. They did but that didn't really help. I asked again about the Museum Pass. The only reply I got was that they thought they had passes but that \"everything is locked up now\". I felt compelled to tell the younger fellow that I felt the check-in process and service had been \"amateur\". He simply stood there somewhat perplexed as I went up to my room with my two rollerbags and my hand carry. Not a great beginning. The room was lovely - a spacious junior suite with lots of room and a large bathroom. I found it odd that the doors of the rooms on the floor would shut very loudly - why don't they have those devices that slowly shut doors? The bed was very comfortable.I sent off an email to the manager about the problems at check-in and did get a response from an executive of the hotel but not until my last day. Separately, this lady had heard about the questions I had - presumably the fellow who checked me in had informed her - and I received a card from her on my second day at the hotel telling me that she had briefed the registration staff on the information I had wanted that they did not know. I was too busy to follow up and never actually got any of the items in the package, including the Museum Pass, which probably was just as well. But if I had known that the hotel staff weren't all that aware of these \"special\" packages, suggesting that they aren't all that special, then I would have just booked the room. Otherwise, I had a good stay, though we were a little disappointed when we went up to the roof terrace to have dinner our second night. When we arrived, it was very hard to see because of the dimmed lighting. The staff seemed confused about whether there was space or not. Somebody led us to this very crowded area in the back, which was noisy, but then she disappeared and we were left unattended. We found somebody else to help seat us and said that the area we were in was too loud and couldn't we sit in the front area which seemed to have more space. We walked back there, but again, because of the dim lighting, I nearly tripped. They couldn't decide for a while whether they could give us a table. But after a couple of minutes, they sat us in an area which actually had a lot of space, though it was far too noisy. Not a very relaxing option if you are looking for a laid-back dinner alfresco. The bar downstairs was even noisier. I would come back to this hotel as the rooms are very good. The area around the hotel is currently under reconstruction so walking around may require some detours. But the hotel's location is very good. And to be fair, there was a sincere attempt to remedy the problem I had, though the matter wasn't really resolved since I never managed to follow up on the questions I had at check-in due to my busy schedule.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cWonderful welcoming and recommended\u201d", "Author": "critictogo", "ReviewID": "UR115854835", "Content": "Great location near cathedral, port, restaurants and metro.

I just wanted to veg out so I ordered room service, a steak and chips, which was delicious, hot and very reasonably priced. There are loads of TV channels, a radio/ipod dock and a full stacked mini bar. I really enjoyed the Montreal guides left in my room. The bathroom is also stocked with toilettries from the hotel spa, fluffy robes and gowns. Slippers would have completed this but I'm just fussy. Before bed I was bought a booklet containing the weather forecast for the next day along with some chocolates. It's touches like that that you're paying for. I had a brilliant nights sleep and woke up feeling refreshed. I had breakfast sent to my room for an extra charge, and it was delicious. The porter came to collect my bags for check out and stored them for me all day while I explored the city. There are also complimentary computers available downstairs for internet access/printing. I would recommend Le Place d'Armes, it is a truly beautiful hotel with super service. I paid around \u00c2\u00a3170 for the most basic room, I have heard this was due to the season (a week before Grand Prix). I think this was a little over priced but it's worth it for a treat!

We attended the lounge and received a cocktail but requested a menu to order something light, although we received the menu, we have not yet had an order taken, nor did any wait staff return to see if we wanted another drink or anything to eat.

To highlight the pluses: The people where very nice when dealing with the negatives of this hotel. The room if gorgeous. The location is great. Now for the negative. 1. Front desk needs to be able to answer the phone when a customer calls down. We stayed there for 3 days and never once got anyone on the phone. This is not their fault but something needs to be done. 2. Make sure the rooms are spotless. We had red wax dripped all over our bathroom floor when we got there (doesn't give you the nicest welcome). 3. In the information binder about the hotel services under the food section you need to remove the statement about a complimentary continental breakfast is available in 701 suite. This is untrue unless it is included in your room price (which means you are paying for it and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not complimentary). We were disgusted to pay $38.00 for a VERY continental breakfast. I had more options and hot food at a holiday express in Buffalo 2 months earlier. We were able to get the charges removed and they were very nice about it but it was embarrassing to say the least. 4. If you are not going to update the windows then don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have deliveries at 6:30am just outside your guestrooms. Pepsi delivery people had their truck idling for 30mins. I have 2 year old to wake me up at 6:30 hence the need for the vacation to your hotel.

The staff are hard work - although they speak English on reception many of the staff around the hotel don't or pretend they don't so eventually you just give up. Perhaps that is want they want you to do. We found the staff on reception unhelpful and abrupt and the overall service poor. Perhaps it is the French/Canadian way - just like many hotels in France? Over the years we have stayed in countless hotels in North America both Canada and the US where we travel extensively and this is the first hotel we have stayed in that we have disliked. The room we had was very dark and the dark wood/laquered furniture just adds to this. The beds were hard and the bathroom although it had a nice big shower was also very dark. Our windows looked straight out onto an office block and on the basis that we could see them so they could probably see us you felt you had to keep the blinds down or closed all the time so whenever we were in our room we had to keep the lights on. On our first evening the light in the closet and one by the bed did not work. They came and fixed them next day but the one in the closet was left hanging out by wires and stayed on permanently for the next 4 days. They also left bits of ceiling tile all over the floor which was still there for the next 2 days until we picked it up. Don't they check these things when they prepare the room for the next guests or just rely on you to report them? There were only 4 hangers so we had to ask for more. Day 1 our room was cleaned at 9.30am as the maid was going in as we left for breakfast. Day 2 she turmed up at 4.30pm - after one visit to reception and 2 phone calls to housekeeping later. Apparently rooms are done any time between 9-5pm and you have to ask if you want it done before noon but they only tell you this when you complain the room has not been done when you get back after a day out. Breakfast was included in our stay but is a waste of time. Poor selection of not very fresh cereals and breads and lukewarm coffee or water for tea. They also give you a bill to sign each morning so they can charge the hotel for this as they claim to be 'separate' from the hotel, forcing you to feel compelled to give a tip for someone to bring you a lukewarm beverage and the rest is self service. Drinks, food and the mini bar are over priced. The 'happy hour' advertised on the website no longer exists. We used the bar only once in the end as it always seemed to be full of noisy buisness people staying over after conferences or meetings in the building next door. The same was true at breakfast when we always seemed to be sitting next to someone having a business meeting. The roof garden was locked for some reason during our stay despite the fact that the weather was very hot. I would also suggest you check your bill when you leave and what has been charged to your credit card. Despite running through the items with me at the desk that all seemed correct, the woman on reception then printed the bill, put it in an envelope and handed it to me. Luckily we were not leaving for a couple of hours and so when we went out for lunch I took the bill out and had a look and saw that I had been overcharged by almost CSD$900!! I am just glad I looked before we left so I could get the refund on ly card straight away. She didn't even say sorry when I went back to desk just - 'oh yes that is a mistake don't worry I will do a refund'.

We shopped the online specials and prepaid in advance to get a junior suite with balcony for $259/nt ++ tax, etc. This suite was very spacious, with a fabulous and well-appointed bathroom with a snazzy, deep jetted tub and huge separate shower. The outdoor balcony had cute furnishings for dining or simply sitting. The balcony is not large, but serves the purpose of sitting outside with a drink or room service. The view to our right was Montreal's first skyscraper, and to our left we could see the lights of the old port and distant hills. Although you do not have a water view, this hotel has a better location in our opinion than staying in the touristy old port area. We were one block from the Basilica de Notre Dame (be sure to see that!), and just steps away from Place D'Armes (being renovated during our visit). We could walk to the port, restaurants and nightspots easily, but we were just blocks from the Metro and Chinatown, too. Inside our suite, there was a sitting area for watching TV, with a sofa, coffee table and two armchairs, plus a small table and chairs by the windows. We switched on the faux fireplace just for ambiance.The bed was wonderful; we slept great. The hotel's restaurant AIX is highly rated and expensive, but very, very good. We did not eat in the bar restaurant, but I think you can get reasonably priced fare there. Room service appeared to be from the same kitchen as AIX, so the food also was very good but reasonably priced. In fact, we started each day with room service and even dined on our balcony one evening. The concierge was extremely helpful, and bell/valet were, too. My only complaint was that the desk in our room had an electronic outlet where you were supposed to be able to plug in chargers, but this was not working, as well as the refrigerator. I mentioned this to the front desk, and they came up and messed around with the wall outlet. The refrigerator started working, but the desk outlet jacks never did. You would think hotels would understand the urgency of having live outlets for today's \"information\" world. However, the hotel does have two free Internet-connected computers in a hotel lobby-way, and you can print boarding passes and other documents for a small fee. Other than this complaint about the computer desk outlet, we absolutely loved Le Place D'Armes in Montreal and will stay there again if we return. By the way, I tried to book a junior suite online and the system said it was unavailable, but I called the hotel directly and they had one.

I especially appreciated Henri at the front desk who more often than not was the \"lucky man\" for my numerous inquiries and idle chat about his city. More Things we like about the Pd'A: The location on the edge of Old Montreal and still close to the Metro station one block away at the convention center. The Gym on the 5th floor where I couldn't get the HDTV to work in the gym and call the front desk. A staff member was there in one minute apologizing for the TV not working when he knew the snafu was caused by my own hi-tech incompetance. The evening wine and cheese; a very nice gesture and a great place to relax after a busy day. Ditto for the free continental breakfast in Suite 701 with plenty of breads, cereals, fresh fruit to fill everyone except a hungry lumber-jack. I liked that there were always fresh apples in the gym and lobby; The Roof Top Bar was trendy and unexpectedly classy with a great view of Notre Dame Basilica; A working Wi-Fi with a stong signal everywhere on premises; The bed which my wife said was one of the most comfortable she had ever slept-in; general upkeep and cleanliness everywhere. Things that could have been better at the Pd'A: We stayed in Building 2 and had no exposed bricks on any the charm in other rooms noted in these reviews. We paid for a deluxe suite and felt the room was really a standard/superior room; I was disappointed the hotel didn't give us a nicer room considering I told them it was a \"major anniversary\" at the time of booking; the the fireplace didn't work for reasons unknown; the jet tub wouldn't hold water due to a leaky drain rendering it totally useless during our stay; the huge overhead shower didn't work well due to low water pressure; the room lighting was too dim for our liking. These items only slightly downgraded our stay. If you are staying in Montreal for a convention or there for leisure, I highly recommend you stay in Old Montreal.

The bathroom was large and clean, but the water pressure was not really up to the rainforest shower head and the jacuzzi tub sounded like a rocket taking off.

The service was superb and all the staff that we accounted were very attentive. Unfortunately, bad experience happened in the Rainspa. Part of the attraction on their website was the spa service at very reasonable prices. With that kind prices, I did not expect services equals Mandarin Oriental or Aman Resorts, but neither did I expect the worst experience ever. The reception area was cramped. Other guests and I had to stand there waiting to be called. I booked a 60-minute facial and 60-minute body scrub. I was not given any robe to change, neither was covered by any towel during the treatment. It was rather bizarre and unprofessional. But these shortcomings are rather trivial comparing to cheating on the time. I was given only 40-minute facial, then was sent to the steam room. Had I not come out the steam room by myself, I think the \"esthetician\" would be happy that I stay there till the end of hour. For the second part of the treatment, she finished 15 minutes short. Luckily, each room, though dark, has a clock so I had sense of time. But I would imagine for most people in a treatment room, the last thing on mind is to track time. When I complained this to the receptionist, I was offered 25% discount as prorated charge. What surprised me later was the management's response on how I should feel properly compensated for the loss of the time of treatment because they offered me discount accordingly. When you are on a family vacation, you make proper arrangement to dedicated two hours on your wellness. They short changed you, giving some symbolic discount, then they think they are fair. This utter nonsense just shows you that THE RAINSPA DOES NOT understand. Sometimes, the employee's bad behavior is just the reflection of the management attitude.

It was from 5 to 7 each night. You don't have to stay in the restaurant - we took ours back to our room to enjoy. The free breakfast was decent. Well stocked with bagels, croissants, danishes, fruits, and cheese. If you wanted omelets or pancakes, you can order off their menu - of course you would have to pay for that. The free breakfast was more than enough in my view. Valet service was good, sometimes our car was parked outside on the street instead of the underground lot.

It is literally next to the famed Notre Dame Cathedral. The rooms are fresh, immaculate and beautifully decorated.

Parking is paid on a 24 hour rate, which is a good thing if you are only looking to stay one night but want to wander around for most of the next day. The parking rate is quite reasonable and totally worth it. Tips: Old Quebec is located south of the busy, commercial St. Catherine's street.

Let me start by saying the location is fantastic - more on that later. We stayed 2 nights. The lobby is nice, the bellmen were very responsive and helpful as was the reception and concierge staff (mostly). The Suite 701 bar served us perhaps the best burger we've ever had (Kobe beef with guiness cheddar cheese and an onion remoulade) and was very \"chic\". There was a complimentary wine and cheese reception every evening from 5-7 as well. The terrace bar on the roof was very neat and hip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you are a bar-goer both the terrace and Studio 701 are for you. Our room viewed from the door looked nice, however upon closer inspection the area rug was heavily stained and just looked dirty. There were small stains on the white comforter, and the bathroom floor had strands of hair that were definitely not ours. A couple spiders in the shower, a bolt lock on the door and cordless phone that did not work all conspired to make the room less than satisfactory for the price. In addition we thought it a bit much that they charged you $1.25 for every call you made, even local and toll-free. There are no ice machines. If you want ice you call the front desk and they deliver it, in theory. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cost us the tip for delivery however because they never delivered the ice. I had to go to the bar and get a bucket. There was also no mini-fridge, which are usually standard at hotels in this price range in my experience. When we mentioned a few of these things the first night they immediately sent a cleaning crew up and vacuumed everything. At check out we were ready to tell them about our stay, but the reception person never even asked us how our stay was. We did receive an email from the general manager after we returned home thanking us for our stay. When we replied to him with our issues, he took one of our nights off the bill. This was frankly unexpected and we were impressed. The staff was very responsive. The location of the hotel is excellent, lodged right between a metro stop and the old port/town area. It is across the square from the Notre Dame Basilica. The devil is in the details and it is here that this hotel falls down. If they can master the small things then this could become a very nice place.

The location of this hotel was great...right across the street from the Notre Dame Cathedral...close walk to tons of cafes/restuarants/shops in Old Montreal. There is a McD's and a Starbucks just down the street. Relatively easy to find. The hotel is beautiful inside and out. We opted for their valet underground parking ($24/day) because we were lazy but literally 20 steps across the street is a public parking lot that charged $18.75. The only problem with the public parking was that the attendent was rarely there when we were there and the machine for credit cards was not working and we didn't want to risk a ticket. The hotel has a bar/lounge called Suite 701 which we only got the time to visit once. It was a nice professional crowd (think mostly suits and dresses), they have a rooftop terrace, and also with your stay you get a free glass of house wine & cheese nightly. It was easy to get the wine using our vouchers BUT the cheeses are located in a restaurant just down below Suite 701 along the bar and its really awkward when you go up to get some. We had some cocktails which were great and a poutine (with red wine sauce and pulled beef) that was AMAZING! The room was great. We had the basic room and it was very roomy and modern. Housekeeping was great. The only issue we had was that there could be better ventilation. The windows do not open and our \"neighbours\" opted to smoke pot every morning and the smell would seep into the front of our room. To each their own, I suppose. My boyfriend and I celebrated an anniversary while in Montreal and he arranged with the hotel to have roses delivered to our room one of the mornings as a surprise. However they forgot to deliver them and he had to talk to them to get them with me there. Some tips: -if you go out the main exit, turn right onto Rue St. Jacques and about in 2 blocks there is a great place called Egg-spectation that serves all day breakfast in addition to other foods; they had a great selection of food and it was delicious -also on Rue Notre Dame (parallel to St Jacques) we ate a delicious meal at La Sauvagine; they have a gorgeous gothic chandelier and excellent creme brulee; the staff however spoke little English -Gogo's Lounge on St. Laurent: wide variety of martini's and interesting shots; they do not have cover; they play a lot of wayback playbacks which are always fun; probably a 18-25 year old crowd -we walked home from St. Catherine's street one day and it took about 25 minutes...it was a nice walk and if its a pleasant day would highly recommend it -visit St. Viateur Bagel's, they are open 24/7 and have fresh delicious Montreal style bagels!

The hotel appears to have potential, and maybe i was just unlucky. I booked my room the same week of my stay, and was limited in terms of options. I was given a standard room which unfortunately was by the elevator. The standard rooms do not do the hotel justice in comparison to the pictures and write-ups on the hotel's website. I tried to change rooms - even upgrade but they could not accomodate. Later that night i unfortunately found out that you can CLEARLY hear the music from the nightclub if your room is above it on the 3rd floor (i assume there aren't rooms on the 2nd floor...it would be unbearable) - until 3am. As all travellers know, this sometimes happens and I'm simply encouraging other guests to make sure they are booked into something better than a standard room if their trip is for pleasure and they're looking to truly enjoy what is considered to be a nice hotel. Another thing to look out for is the valet parking at the hotel. At check-in I parked my car on the street at 2pm and handed the valet the keys. An hour later, the car was gone - presumably in the secure lot they advertise. At 11pm it was back on the street. I'm not sure why it (a less than 1 year old sports car) was brought back out - perhaps so someone else's (more important car?) could be put in? Regardless, I don't consider leaving my car on the street rather than in the advertised 'secure lot' as being valet parked. Unfortunately the car was also over 2 feet from the curb, on a corner, with the sideview mirrors sticking out - an accident waiting to happen on a busy city street. I let the front desk know about these issues when i checked out - they were apologetic, but not helpful. As I drove away, i had the luxury of watching the valet back another guest's car into the one behind it. He got out and walked immediately back to the hotel...not checking either for damage.

Superb location - you cant really get much better in the old quarter (saying this the old quarter is very small) The Hotel is almost opposite the Notra Dame Bassilica We stayed in a suite that was over 2 floors - it almost made the upstairs floor redundant and the room felt much smaller than I was expecting as I hadnt read that it would be over 2 floors Beds of reasonable comfort Free wine (1 glass only) and cheese between 5pm and 7pm which was a nice sort of touch but on 1 evening the place was packed Breakfast and food in the hotel I would describe as average - certainly no better The main thing that I didnt like was being charged an excessive amount for a Crib for the baby, which I didnt know I was being charged until I checked out and it came to about $120 which whilst its not much it really pissed us off. We stayed in 4 hotels on our stay in Canada and this was the only hotel that charged us for this - they should have mentioned at the start of our stay - this knocks it from 3-4 stars to 2 stars Hotel staff are friendly Montreal itself is nothing to rave about. It can easily be covered in a day. Old quarter, lake area and park, view over the city - not really anything. My wife and I were quite bored after the 1st day The highlight of our stay was eating in a superb restaurant - Bonapartes - excellent French cuisine - go for the sampler menu (which is more a many course meal) and Terriers wine (great).

The hotel, which has a very nice Old Montreal location one block from the Metro stop, has a website which boasts of its commitment to luxury and finesse in every aspect of the stay. Pretty big words to live by. My own feeling after staying there is that, while it's a good hotel, it doesn't rise to the level of the top-tier hotels in Montreal and probably doesn't deserve some of the hype being given to it. Let's start where first impressions usually stick, with the Front Desk. I can best describe the staff as \"Youth Brigade,\" young, not particularly well-trained, surprisingly not at ease speaking English, and always looking a bit overwhelmed behind the desk. At check-in, one young lady, apparently very preoccupied processing a dry-cleaning order, rather than saying hello, simply turned to the concierge for help in checking us into the room. The concierge, and older, slightly more jaded gentleman, obliged - this obviously wasn't the first time he had to swoop in to help the desk staff out. Our room was a Superior King room. I must say, the bed (pictured) was immensely comfortable, with plenty of pillows to make it seem like I was sleeping on a cloud. This more or less made up for less-than-excellent housekeeping. Our room had no less than four burned-out light bulps (two in the bathroom, one at the armoir and one at the bed's headboard). When we called housekeeping about it, we were surprised to find when we returned back from dinner to find they had only fixed one light (in the bathroom). Nightly turn-down service is a great touch for any hotel to offer. Here, it's fine - not great. One bottle of water (for two guests) and two pieces of Lindt chocolate. I would have hoped that the maid had noticed the electrical issues with the room and did something about it, but no such luck. The bathroom can best be described as large and cavernous, with dark tiles and dark marble floors. As big as the bathroom was, it was not particularly functional, with the counterspace at the sink barely adequate for even one guest to place toiletries. My wife and I just figured that the hotel may cater more to single, or business travelers than to families or couples, given the layout of the bathroom. Our \"Refresh\" package also included continental breakfast and a wine and cheese reception each day in the main-floor bar. Like the front desk, expect service from a youthful, not thoroughly trained staff. And woe to anyone who arrives for these services with only a few minutes left before they conclude! For breakfast, we arrived 10 minutes prior to them stopping service, only to find that the servers were aggressively beginning the cleaning-up process. Plates were removed hastily off our table before we were completely done. A server immediately grabbed a basket of bread away from the bar as I was approaching it to get another bagle. What's the rush? Lunch was still 2 hours away. The hotel does live up to its lofty self-proclaimed standards in two areas, though. The first is the excellent restaurant Aix Cuisine du Terroir located in the hotel's sub-level. This is a serious restaurant, which merits the critical praises it's been receiving, with superbly rendered main courses and desserts. Try the house-smoked salmon, sesame grilled tuna or rack of lamb. For dessert, be prepared to be wowed by delectable maple syrup pie and ice cream. Service was consistently attentive and cordial. The second was the small, but well-appointed Rainspa, complete with an impressive Turkish-style steam room that you can't miss as a spa guest. I had a 90-minute Swedish massage by Lize, a very knowledgeable and conscientious physical therapist. So overall, we had a good but not great, experience at this hotel. If a hotel is going to pose itself as \"luxury,\" it should offer more than what this hotel does.", "Date": "June 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cIncredible\u201d", "Author": "pablosek", "ReviewID": "UR7780862", "Content": "After a six hour drive, we finally pulled up late at night to this grand entrance, that's beautifully lit (it felt like we were in a movie).

Immediatelly we are congratulated on our anniversary and referred to by name. Our paper work (which has been awaiting our arrival) is briskly handed over, inluding the key cards and coupons for the complimentary wine/cheese (which we didn't even get to enjoy). We arrive in a very large deluxe room, dimly lit, classical music playing in the back ground. Chocolate covered strawberries waiting on the side table, Lindt chocolates on the bed. Double soaker tub with jets in the middle of this beautifully chic bathroom. Add wine, strawberries, and a beautiful woman, and this was the most perfect evening on our little escape. Breakfast was delicious, ample, and in bautiful surroundings. The hotel has quite a bit of classical architecture present (like the outside, and partially inside), but it is beautifully blended with modern design. Very chic- perfect for Montreal. We only stayed one night and progressed to Old Quebec the following day (Fairmont Chateau Frontenac) and Charlevoix the day after (Fairmont - Le Manoir Richelieu). Needless to say Place D'armes set the stage for a wonderful weekend. To be honest, I think it set the bar for us in terms of overall feel and accomodation we expect in a hotel.

We had a great time - the Hotel Place D'Armes, overall, was GREAT. There were a few MINOR details that the hotel could have fixed. Here is our review: PRICE - We paid $195 canadian dollars per night excluding taxes. HOTEL - The hotel is 3 buildings that are combined. We stayed in building 2. I'm not sure which are the newer areas and which are the older, but our building was very nice. The other buildings are connected to the main reception area - you walk through sitting areas to access the different elevator banks to each building. There are a lot of common/seating areas that are very nice! LOCATION - The location really could not have been better. The hotel is a short walk to the hustle and bustle of Old Montreal and all the shops and restaurants. The port is just beyond Old Montreal, really close, where you could find Cirque Du Soleil, the Labyrinthe, the Science Centre and more. Notre Dame Basilica is just around the corner and Chinatown is 2 blocks away. As for Downtown, it's definitely walkable at about a mile away (to the Underground City), but if you don't want to walk, the closest metro is only 2 blocks away (Place D'Armes stop) and a short ride into Downtown. ROOM - We had four people and stayed in a Superior Room with two double beds. The room was very large, none of us felt cramped while we were there. You walk in and there is a large closet with an iron, ironing board, 2 bathrobes, hangers, drycleaning bags, umbrella and safe on the left. Immediately on the rigt is the large bathroom. The two double beds had down comforters and were very comfortable. There was a large entertainment center with a 27\" television, DVD/VCR combo, minibar, wine glasses and mini-fridge. BATHROOM - The bathroom was prerty large. There was a large console with a flat sink and toiletries, enough counter space to put your toiletries, as well as a shelf underneath with towels and a hair dryer. The toiletries were very nice. It was a plus that they offered conditioner (many hotels only offer shampoo), for those of us with long hair. The shower was huge! It was large enough for 4 people and had a rain shower and a regular nozzle. Not ideal if you want to take a bath, but all of our group only took showers anyway. ENTERTAINMENT CENTER - The entertainment center was very nice. There was a TV and a DVD/VCR player. I thought the latter was great if you wanted to watch a late night video or something. We didn't bring any DVDs with us though because most hotels never offer this, and weren't able to take advantage of that. There were also surround sound speakers installed around the room, that I bet would be great if you were watching a movie! DECOR - The decor was very modern with leather headboards and dark furniture. Very sheek. There was also a fake fireplace that you could turn on. That was a nice touch. LIGHT - A bunch of people complained about the lights in the room not being sufficient. We didn't find that to be the case. There are a bunch of table lamps, a couple of floor lamps, some wall lamps and plenty of overhead ceiling lights. There were also two very bright reading lights by the bed. The lighting in the bathroom is another story - it is very dim and not great for makeup, etc. The hotel could stand to make the bathroom lighting a little better. BREAKFAST - The hotel offered free continental breakfast until 10:30 on weekdays and until 11:00 on weekends. Some of the reviews didn't think it was that great, but we thought it was perfect. It included, toast, bagels, various jams, fresh fruit, croissants, muffins, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, muesli, cereal, coffee, tea and juice. By the time the four of us were done, we were stuffed! BREAKFAST CAUTION - On our first day eating breakfast, we were presented menus by the waitstaff which had larger breakfasts than the continental breakfast on the counter, french toast, omelettes, etc. We didn't think this was included, but the menu said at the top (basically), \"Free breakfast is provided to our hotel guests, but for those who are joining us from outside hotel, here are the prices.\" So we proceeded to order lavish breakfasts (all four of us!), only to get a bill at the end for $50!!!! Ultimately it was our fault for not double checking, but the waitstaff should make it clear that ONLY the continental breakfast is actually included since the menu seems to contradict this. WINE AND CHEESE - As a very nice extra touch, the hotel gave us coupons for a free glass of wine and cheese for everyone in our party for every night that we were staying there. You could take advantage between 5-7pm. If you aren't around during that time, you can still get the free wine in the lounge, just not the cheese. SERVICE - Service was hit or miss. Everyone at the hotel was polite, but not necessarily nice or excited to be there. We did actually have a couple of issues with service. 1. The first night we took advantage of the free wine/cheese in the lounge, we asked if we could substitute something else for the wine. We were told that we could get a small glass of beer. Two members of our party, who don't drink wine, got the beer. The second night, we tried to do this again and were abruptly told that substitutions were not allowed. I told them they had let us the night before, but the waitress didn't seem to care and wouldn't allow it. 2. The second night we went to get wine and cheese in the lounge (it's help yourself), the bartender literally grabbed the plate our of my husband's hand and said, \"are you guests of this hotel?\" We said, yes, of course and the bartender said, \"Well I need your tickets.\" My husband said, my wife has them, i'll bring them right back, but the bartender wouldn't let him get any food until we produced the tickets! 3. We were only given the supposed daily newspaper outside our door one night while we were there. 4. Upon checkout (we never received the bill under our door, as promised for \"express checkout\"), we were charged for a bottle of champagne from the mini-bar that we never drank. It was promptly taken off, but I wonder how many people this happens to that don't notice. Some of the past reviewers said this happened to them too - just beware. 5. On our last day, the phone rang for one ring at 7am, waking us up. Thinking it was just a fluke, we went back to bed, only to have the phone ring again once every hour for the next 3 hours! Since it was our last day and we were up already, there was nothing really to be done, but explain it to the receptionist upon checking out. He didn't really seem to care though. 6. When we presented the valet with our ticket for our car, it took them 25 minutes to bring the car back. Kind of annoying since we really wanted to get on the road to head back home. TURNDOWN SERVICE - Every night we would come back to the room and the lights would be dim, music would be playing and chocolates, a bottle of water and the next day's weather forecast would be set beside our bed. A very nice touch! The only problem was that the maid clearly didn't check to see how many people were staying in the room, because s/he only left two chocolates and one bottle of water for four people. We're not complaining about getting free stuff, believe me, just pointing it out! INTERNET - There are two free computers with high-speed internet access in the lobby. If you bring your laptop, though, you can access the high-speed internet in your room, either by cable or wireless. The cable is free, but for the wireless, there is a daily charge. We just used the cable since it reached the bed anyway. PARKING - We paid $21 per day to valet park our car. The website doesn't mention this, but we found out ahead of time since we didn't assume anything was free. A few of the reviewers before me were surprised and annoyed by the charge, but parking in a large city is never free. SUMMARY - I would definitely stay at this hotel again, the rooms were great, the amenities perfect, the breakfast and wine and cheese definite plusses. The only thing that slightly annoyed me was the service and the lack of attention to detail. None of that really impacted our stay though, we had a great time!", "Date": "May 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat character, great location\u201d", "Author": "go_leir", "ReviewID": "UR7706683", "Content": "I was in Montreal for a conference, and stayed at the Place d'Armes.

One major taboo was crossed by the hotel staff and I would be extremely reluctant to stay here again. We booked via a package on LuxuryLink. I called in advance to setup spa and dinner reservations with the concierge. On arrival there was no record of any arrangements, so we did them over. We did not end up with the same times but part of traveling is to be reasonably flexible and we made it work. Montreal in August is a beautiful city. We had a great time seeing the city. Highly recommended. The food in the hotel was good, especially our meal at Aix. It's a delight to have a drink on the rooftop; one need not be a guest to do so. Staff was generally friendly but there was a wide range of experience. The checkout was a small disaster with billing errors due to not looking up the package contents that I had already purchased: the rebate on the tax should have been applied to the whole package, not just the charges from our stay. Be wise about the tax policy; the mechanism offered at the front desk does not come close to giving you the best return. The grand taboo? Twofold really. We were resting comfortably in our room late one afternoon, after the room had been cleaned, and the door was abruptly opened by someone from the outside. No knock. Weird. As soon as I called out, \"who's there?\" the door closed. Had to be staff since a keycard was used. The second part? My video iPod was stolen out of my carry bag. Apparently the twenty dollar tip we left for housekeeping the first night of our four night stay was not enough, or represented that we had money to spare. The response by the management was lukewarm at best. I realize that I am a guest and that I could take more significant precautions such as using a safe. That's on me.

I received a slightly better rate booking through AAA after comparing everybody. Only glitch was the hotel seemingly did not have my reservation - I did have my AAA confirmation, so be sure to print and keep it with you if you book through them. Kara was the associate I dealt with at the hotel at check in and assured me there would be absolutely no problem. Placed me in the Executive Suite for the inconvenience of the slight delay and was extremely pleasant. Rene assisted and was equally as cordial, pleasant and helpful. This was consistent with my stay regardless of the hour of day. I manage customer service for a living. I would hire both of these fine people in a second. (Incidentally, everyone spoke very good English, which was so helpful as my French is limited to pleasantries) Executive Suite was fantastic. If you are extremely picky, the carpet needed a shampoo, but the amenities and comfort were first class. I must suspect that the standard rooms are equally as comfortable based on my discussions with other visitors I met on my stay who were equally as complementary. Place d'Armes includes a breakfast buffet - continental style - which was fine. Coffee was hot. Staff there were friendly. Great start to the day. The restaurant transforms into a night club that stays open until 3am on weekends. This was PERFECT for how I wanted to enjoy Montreal. The interesting thing is that the noise that eminates from the club does not create a nuisance for those with rooms nearby. Well insulated. Great drinks. Beautiful people abound. I could not thank Kim and Prescill enough for the time they showed me on Sunday night - both bartend at the club in the hotel and on Sunday night after the bar closed at midnight, took me to the \"local\" scene that tourists do not visit. Everyone I came across was friendly, sociable and just simply fun to be around. If either of you read this \"thanks! You guys really added to my weekend!\" Jean-Phillip and Erik were helpful with the bags and car, too. A feature I love about this hotel is its location in Old Montreal. It is within a leasurely walking distance to the riverfront, museums, and open market areas of the city. It is kitty-corner to the Notre Dame Basillica which is a must see.

Fortunately, it was back by the next day but then we discovered that the whirlppool wasn't working which we decided to not bring up. The showers, by the way, are great -- very roomy with a rainfall shower head that was most pleasant. There were some little confusions too with our bill when we checked out -- little things like that which make the hotel seem like it might be falling apart on the inside and that management is a little discombobulated. We were very pleased though that they gave us a discount for our troubles. The hotel is nicely located between View Montreal and the Jazz Fest -- very convenient. If you're fussy I wouldn't stay here but if you don't mind a few rough edges, it's a pretty pleasant hotel.

The Hotel Place d'Armes is a recent retrofit of three adjacent buildings. The furnishings throughout the hotel are modern: dark woods, conservative colors, and interesting lighting. There is a bar on the first floor that is setup for breakfast in the morning, and transforms into one of Montreal's hotspots at night. The hotel offers wine and cheese reception coupons for happy hour. It is a nice offer, but I never used the coupons, because the local culture is to work later and proceed directly to dinner [which lasts at least three hours]. The hotel hosts a fabulous restaurant which is directly beneath the bar. For those who love heavy meat dishes, go for the lamb or wild boar. If you can't get enough Copper River Salmon, then definitely have the artic char. The rooms at the hotel are fairly large -- although I can't speak for them all. The decor and feel are very much 'W Hotel', but without the Heavenly Bed or Heavenly Shower. The bed is a pilow-top, with high thread-count cotton sheets, and a down comforter in a cotton douvet [all white on my stay]. There is a desk with high-speed Ethernet, dial-up, and power. The chair is executive-style and comfortable. There are two types of lighting: regular incandescent and LED. The regular lighting is built into the large furniture, which provides good enough light to see where you are walking and that you are picking out the right color socks. The LED lighting is a very cold color, and does not add much to the feel of the place. There is one large armoire with drawers for clothes. Iron and ironing board are included. The in-room safe, slippers, robe, and laundry bags are tucked into various places. There is enough room around the armoir to drop three large suitcases and not impede the primary path from door-to-bath-to-bed. The mini-bar is setup with enough booze to forget any bad business day, as well as the day after. The entertainment center includes shelving with books, red wine, wine glasses, ~27-inch TV, and fireplace. The room I was in had surround sound. The bath is entirely stone. The shower runs the length of one wall with a step entry at the end away from the regular shower head, with an overhead raindrop shower. Counterspace is a limited, but the shelf under the sink provided room to set things not being used. Despite all these nice things, everytime a bus drove by, I felt compelled to check if the windows were closed. Another nice touch [sic] was the 6AM shock of construction on the terrace above my room. Since the company I was visiting provided an extremely discounted rate at this hotel, the decision was made for me on staying here. At regular rates, I would have stayed at the W [five blocks away] and visited the Place d'Armes for the restaurant and bar.", "Date": "June 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cClassy option in Old Montreal\u201d", "Author": "SixtyDays", "ReviewID": "UR5323177", "Content": "This is a very stylish hotel in a good location for a tourists visit.

There was no exposed bricks in the room, but it was a good size, elegant furnishings with some trendy touches. The hotel is not aimed at the 20-30 old crowd and hence the design is maybe not as trendy or as hip as many other boutique hotels. The bed was extremely comfortable, but the pillows did smell a bit musty and even after requesting new pillow cases the smell remained. The room did not have a bath in it either, and although the shower was large it would have been nice to relax in a bath after a day's sightseeing. However, the bathroom design was very stylish and hip. The wine and cheese voucher was a pleasant touch and the wine was drinkable enough, and I agree that the cheeses were nothing special. The breakfast was very tasty and having it in the hotel's bar made a nice change to the usual breakfast room scenario. All in all this is an excellent hotel and I would definitely recommend it if a good price is available.

Bigger is not always better.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "dwoods1073", "ReviewID": "UR3480133", "Content": "We enjoyed a four night stay in a deluxe king room.

Hotel Place D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Armes is a very nice boutique hotel in a prime section of Old Montreal, a short walk to both the old port and downtown Montreal. The hotel is a little hard to drive to because of all the one-way streets, and the street is full of construction vehicles working on Phase 2 of the hotel, making it hard to find a place to pull over, grab your luggage and hand off your car to the valet; however, with a little maneuvering, it can be done. The staff at the check-in is very friendly and accommodating, quick with directions and always greeting us warmly after our outings. The valet was very helpful, going back to our car to retrieve items we had forgotten in our haste to avoid blocking the road when arriving. The lobby, public areas and guestrooms of the hotel are classically decorated and very pleasing. Coffee, tea, cappuccino and espresso are available in the lobby at all times, which is a nice bonus. We booked the \"Romantic Getaway\" for our anniversary for $660, which with taxes and parking, came to $800 for two nights. The package inclusions listed on the website are as follows: Accommodations for two nights in one of our loft style suites Continental breakfast served in bed Wine and Cheese Cocktail every night Dinner for two at Restaurant Aix cuisine du Terroir (service included) Two \u00c2\u00bd hour of massage in the comfort of your bedroom or our dedicated massage room Chilled champagne Accommodations Perhaps I'm wrong, but I've always assumed a loft indicates a second floor. The hotel does have some two-storey suites; however, when our confirmation was e-mailed, it stated \"King Deluxe Room\". I e-mailed the hotel and asked why it stated \"King Deluxe Room\" when the website stated \"loft-style suite\" and I was told that they are the same thing. In any case, our room was of average size, with a nice double-jacuzzi tub. All the photos of rooms I have seen on the web show what is likely a suite. However, that being said, the room was very nicely decorated. We had a corner room with three high windows and a nice view of the edge of the cathedral. The furniture is very attractive and well laid out, the bathroom nicely done, with good shampoos and soaps, etc., and best of all, the king size bed is very comfortable. Although I would not say our room was large, it was a fair bit larger than the standard room in which we had our massages. Although there is a lot of construction currently going on next door, we were never bothered by any noise. I found the room very comfortable and attractive. In our room documents were a couple of business cards with my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name, and our hotel contact information, presumably to give out during business meetings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice touch. Continental Breakfast When we checked in, we were told that we had a choice of breakfast in the restaurant, or in breakfast in bed. We chose to go down to the restaurant, and, for a continental breakfast, we found it very good. There was a wide selection of fruit, breads, yogurts and beverages, as well as some cereals and hard boiled eggs. One strange thing we noticed was that there were no salt shakers anywhere and no salt packets. We asked a waitress for salt, and she appeared to look for some but evidently never found any \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come back in any case. Other than for the hard-boiled eggs, salt probably wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessary. Wine and Cheese Cocktail At check in, you are given two slips that entitle you to your Wine and Cheese cocktail. The wine and cheese was served in the bar section of the restaurant; it might have been nicer if it had been in the lobby bar, which never opened during our stay. You receive one glass of wine per person; if the server asks you if you would like another, make note you will be billed ($18 plus tip for two glasses of wine). Dinner at Restaurant Aix Cuisine du Terroir At check in, you receive a voucher for your dinner, and you just need to tell the front desk when you would like to have the dinner. I had thought that we would be able to order from the regular menu; however, it turned out that the Romance Package has a set menu. We were give a choice of soup or appetizer (although once we made our choice, they brought us both anyways), choice of two entrees, cheese plate and dessert. We had the arctic char with risotto, and although the risotto was rather tasteless, the fish was good. I was too full after a bit of cheese to order a dessert, but my husband had one and it was very good. Other than the risotto, all the food was well prepared and nicely presented, and service was very good as well. Tips were included, but we chose to tip a little extra for the service. Two \u00c2\u00bd hour of massage Ah, the best part of the trip. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not really one for massages. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a few that left me less than overwhelmed; however, our massages at the hotel were excellent. Our masseur was very, very good and I was impressed enough that I may actually go for a massage again someday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I definitely will if we return to the hotel. Champagne The front desk will bring up the champagne whenever you like; we had it delivered soon after we checked in. It was a half bottle of Moet & Chandon (not cheap) and was delivered on ice. It was very enjoyable. Summary Was the package worth it? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say yes, seeing as the King Deluxe Rooms are nearly $300 a night before tax. The standard room is nearly $200 a night and would probably feel a little small in comparison to your average North American hotel room. It turns out that the wine and cheese and continental breakfast are included for all guests, so the Romance Package\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extras are the dinner, champagne and massages, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing would retail for much more than the difference we paid between booking just the room, or booking the package. The hotel is in a great location for exploring Old Montreal, and is a welcome refuge after a long day of shopping and sightseeing. Would I stay at Hotel Place D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Armes again?

As a result, the general feel around the hotel was quiet. The main foyer / bar area is very impressive, however, the bar was not 'open' beyond the Director's Cocktail Reception in the evening (5:00PM to 7:00PM), which was unfortunate given the high ceilings and funky chandelier lighting. It is quite the space. Rooms were very \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBombay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 style \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is not my taste and the bathroom was a good size with black and white \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcart deco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feel to it. Products were Essentiel Elements of San Fran, which were replaced with new products each day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no penny pinching on these items. Our room was on the 6th floor. Only point to note for future is the ice machines are located on the 3rd and 4th floors. By chance, when we were riding the elevator, it stopped on the 4th floor and there it was the ice machine sitting directly outside the doors of room number 404 and 405. Location was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c across from Notre Dame Basilica and one block from Palais de Congres. Overall, a great weekend away.

I was attending a conference at the Palais des Congres, which was conveniently one block away. My room was clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. Compared to similar hotels in the UK, the room was good-sized. The bed was comfortable and had good lighting for reading. In the closet was a terrycloth robe, slippers, and an umbrella. I found no fault with the room but would have liked more tv channels. The breakfast selection was wide and varied, with smoked salmon, fresh fruit, museli, croissants, etc. I had trouble tearing myself away from the chocolate croissants. After a couple days, the waiter knew my preference for tea over coffee. I won't say that the hotel staff was very friendly, but they were always polite and helpful. Examples: when I lost a button off my coat, they gave me a sewing kit. They volunteered to call the airport bus sevice for me, and when I checked out, handled the VAT refund process for me. Considering that I don't speak French, I thought that they were patient.
