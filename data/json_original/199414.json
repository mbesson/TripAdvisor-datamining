However, as they still had a relatively good rating of 7.2 on Booking.com (as of the date of my reservation), I took a chance. The hotel is located in Charlottenburg, on the west side of Berlin, but very well connected in terms of public transport; you have the U7 subway line that takes you directly to Adenauerplatz, as well as buses (M19, M29, and a few others) that run up and down Kurfurstendamm. The commute from Tegel was only 20min by taking Bus 109 to Jakob Kaiser Platz, then transfer to U7 (it should be noted, though, that it is possible to take Bus 109 directly to Adenauerplatz, where it stops right across the street from the hotel -- but I didn\u2019t do this due to my own preference for subways and lower likelihood of delays); this will probably matter less once Brandenburg opens and Tegel finally shuts down. I also noticed 5-6 taxis that are perpetually lined up and waiting for passengers on Lewishamstra\u00dfe during the entire length of my stay, so that is also an option. The location is convenient, thanks to the excellent public transport in Berlin, and shopaholics will enjoy being so close to Kurfurstendamm (note that the luxury flagships of Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Chanel, etc are only 1-2 blocks away from the hotel); there are numerous restaurants at Adenauerplatz, at least 2 bakeries I frequented, pharmacies, and a supermarket; there is also a currywurst shop across the street. I found the neighborhood safe at night, as it\u2019s a busy intersection and generally well-lit. Although the photos on the website appeared dated, I found my room a bit better than expected; it definitely shows signs of age, but everything was clean and well maintained. The hotel generally gives a business-like feel, without very much personality, and the room has the basics including wardrobe, desk/chair, private bath, TV, phone, alarm clock, controllable heating (but no AC); it will not wow you with luxury, but it\u2019s fine enough. I did appreciate that the rooms seemed soundproofed, as noise from other rooms was muffled, and I couldn\u2019t hear anything above or below me; nights were very quiet, except for the occasional car driving by the Adenauerplatz intersection (so keeping windows open may be a problem \u2013 as it was winter when I stayed, this was not an issue). Toiletry supplied is the combination shower gel/shampoo that is installed as a pump next to the sink and inside the shower. And this may have been the only hotel I\u2019ve stayed where they actually left the towels alone when on the rack as indicated by the sign (although they did replace the towels anyway toward the middle of my stay). Room is tidied daily, bed made, trash emptied, as per usual hotel standards. Breakfast buffet is included in the room rate, and is the typical European fare of breads, cheese, cold cuts, vegetables, gherkin pickles, boiled eggs, yogurt, and various drinks, but also included scrambled eggs/sausages/bacon (which is somewhat unusual for continental Europe imo). A minor inconvenience is that although wifi is free, you have to request the password each time (it regenerates every 2hrs) and it's only available in lobby (I found a weak signal on the 1st floor) -- this is not so convenient, but you don't go on vacation to use the internet for hours on end either; business travelers will find this more of an issue. One other oddity is that there was only 1 free electric socket in the room located by the door; the previous guest had actually unplugged the desk lamp to free up another socket, which I continued, because there is no shortage of lighting with numerous recessed lights in the ceiling, entry way, and bedside lamps. The hotel also provides services including a bar, dry cleaning, and a shoe shine machine in the lobby, none of which I used; the on-site restaurant was only open for breakfast (7am-11am), I believe. The reception desk is open around the clock. I stayed for a week in Feb 2012 at Hotel Panorama, and found it quite comfortable. The room was clean and well maintained, with a large bathroom. The breakfast was good, albeit fairly standard, with convenient opening hours and plenty of seating in the restaurant. The free wifi felt pretty fast. The staff was overall courteous and not intrusive, which I liked; there was one particular woman (I never got her name, but she has long, very light blond hair) that I saw almost every night, who I found very helpful and pleasant \u2013 she let me check in early (on arrival at 10am!) as the room was free, which was much appreciated after the overnight flight from NY. The price to quality ratio is also quite favorable (I paid only about 40 euros per night). The location makes for a good base to explore Berlin, thanks to numerous public transport connections. The neighborhood itself also offers many shops and restaurants. Ultimately, I found Panorama to be a standard business type hotel, and lives up to its official 3-star rating. I would not hesitate recommending it for other travelers.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Purmerend, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "kevertje", "ReviewID": "UR97725984", "Content": "Our company booked this hotel because it's location.

The name of the hotel is explained when you look out of the windows of the room, particulary if you were on the 9th floor as I was. The views from the hotel across the city are amazing. The rooms, however, are small and two single beds really means two single mattresses on the frame of a double bed, which led to poor sleep. The security of the hotel is good, as it is not possible to get into the hallways without an electrontic tag for that floor. The lifts are small, very slow and are the only way to move between floors as the stairs can only be used in case of a fire. The transport links are good, it is 10 minute walk from Charlottenburg S-Bahn station, and there is a bus station right outside the hotel, which has buses to Tegel airport. However, the location of the hotel is not great as the area contains a lot of strip clubs and sex shops which may offend some visitors. The staff are friendly and a number of them do speak English. The food at the hotel is average and the breakfast selection is uninspiring. Overall, this hotel is average, it's not the worst hotel in Berlin but it is not the best either.", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Panorama Am Adenauerplatz Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d199414-Reviews-Panorama_Am_Adenauerplatz_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$77 - $144*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Lewishamstrasse 1</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10629</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "199414", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f6/2b/f62b015d0f783983b30b2ec4f8848bc81large.jpg"}}
