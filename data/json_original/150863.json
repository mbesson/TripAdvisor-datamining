It is a two star at best. There were so many problems small and large that I could not list them all. I am not a picky person and could probably have slept on the beach all week, but if you pay for a 4-5 star resort, you would expect better.The resort is not ready to have guests. Most families waited from 3 to 8 hours for a room. We saw and spoke to about 20-30 families over the first two days having the same problems as us. We arrived at 2 and got a room at 7:00pm. Some did not get rooms until 12:00 in the morning. They had no room keys so they told us to get a guard to open the doors. Trying to find a guard when you needed was a chore. We had three rooms. No A/C in one, the fan in the second room made so much noise that we could not run it while in the room or at night, no control of the A/C in the third (50F or 80). They ran out of beach towels several times a day. They ran out of vodka several times and we had to wait til the next day. You need to get up early to get a lounge chair on the beach and even earlier to get one at the pool. We saw many argument about stolen chairs. The food is just average. Getting reservations at the habachi tables in the habachi restaurant is a trick. You need to get there by 5:45 and wait until 6:30 when it opens to get in line to make reservations for 1 of the 9 seating available the entire evening. The wind here was 20-30 miles per hour with rain every day but that was not their fault. However, dozens of rooms had the roof leak over their beds and complained parts of the ceiling were falling on them as they slept. The halls are always flooded during the rain. Two inches in our room by the door. My sons room door would not lock and we had to wait two hours for a repair man to come fix it. The state of the art Gym is a small room with 1960 bar bells. Our three rooms had no cable TV however I did figure out how to connect them myself and program the TV channels. There were no towel racks or toilet paper holders in the bathrooms. No handles on the shower or toilet doors. Room service was non existent unless you called several times. Rooms were made each day by 6-7:00pm. We always were out of bath towels. We had suites (Preferred Club) but there were no drawers to put our clothes. My wife kept hers in the night table drawers and I used my suitcase. The floors in the rooms and parts of the lobby are smooth tile that were like sheets of ice when wet. We fell or slipped many times. Watch for parts of the sand that has cement chunks exposed (that hurt). Looks like left over from construction. One of three Hobi sailboats were broken making lines very long making there first come first serve policy anoying. We had to stand there for up to 1-2 hours to get the next available one. Well I could go on forever but this should be enough for you to make your decision. There are too many great resorts out there to waste your time on this one.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR635225584", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "sbruce02"}, {"Content": "Lacking many simple things Dec.28th -Jan.4th we just got back . The resort is beautiful and clean,the staff is extremely friendly and will go out of there way to make you happy. That is about the end of my good remarks. They over booked many rooms and gave new people checking in keys to our room twice. So always put the chain lock on! Many things didn't work like many toilets and our safe, there were also ants in some rooms. There is a problem there with people saving lounge chairs and towels. Or maybe there just isn't enough to go around. Expect the staff to enter your room 4 times a day. Once to make the beds, once to replace towels, once to stock the mini fridge and once to turn down your beds. The beds are not very big. Really to small for two average sized people.

We returned last Thursday from an absolutely wonderful vacation. We arrived at the hotel on Christmas morning and was greeted with many smiling faces, champagne and some baked treats. When we were waiting to check-in we found a rep. and mentioned to them that we were booked in a preferred club room and were immediately taken to the preferred club lounge and checked-in within 5 minutes.We stayed in a ground floor room with two double beds. Another traveler had warned us that the ground floor rooms had flooded when it had previously rained, and although it rained while we were there, thankfully nothing flooded.The rooms were beautiful! Even though the room was not made up until the evening for the first three days, the last 4 days the room was made up and cleaned in the morning and touched up again in the evening.There were next to no mosquitoes which was great.Christmas day was wonderfully planned for the kids. They had everyone come to the beach where Santa circled in a helicopter waving to the kids. Later he came onto the resort via horseback and all of the kids were able to sit on him, take pictures and received a nice little present!We enjoyed the beach and all of the pools very much. They worked hard to clean up any sea grass that may have washed up due to the rain.The evening entertainment was very nice, especially the circus evening that was very much like a mini cirque de solei show!My family is vegetarian and was able to find things to eat at every meal and were shocked to find veggie burgers in the preferred club restaurant! The Italian restaurant was great!New Years eve was amazing, and all guests received very nicely wrapped hats and party favors...champagne was abundant!

We where fortunate to have got a room that didn't leak, flood or be overwhelmed with mosquitoes but we did come close as the rooms across the hall flooded which we later found out had flooded more than once.We paid the extra for the Preferred Club to help make sure we got the better service, room, drinks, food, internet and some privacy. Well..... what a complete waist of money and rip-off. There was only one item on the brochure description that was unique to the Preferred Club which was the breakfast and lunch at one restaurant otherwise NOTHING and those that booked standard rooms got everything the same. Other people that had problems with their rooms and proceeded to [--] and complain where upgraded to the Preferred Club at no extra cost but all that they really got was a better room since everything else was the same.During the renovation a lot of money was spent on the wrong things and the hotel will pay in the end. - Plate glass partitions in shower stall and raised vanity sinks in washroom but the toilet seats are the cheapest plastic and already cracking. - There are obvious major problems with sewer lines and plumbing. The staff are constantly fixing clogged pipes and the smell of sewage is prevalent nearly everyday.- There is a major shortage of lounges and a conservative estimate would be at least 150 more are required.- Staff are overwhelmed and they have a policy not to take reservations at the restaurants so at 6:30 every night the restaurants get inundated with a crowd of people all at once instead of controlling the crowd by utilizing reservations and filling in the slack with walk ins if space allowed.The usual excursion rip offs are alive and well and surprisingly the Sunwing rep seems to be a part of it as we heard he was reluctant to make change and the Saona Island trip we took was not worth the money although he highly recommended it.We won't be back and will not recommend anyone to go.", "Date": "Jan 4, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR172153935", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "YorkRegionPotlicker"}, {"Content": "Absolutely Wow!!!

We arrived with an open mind, knowing they had just opened 8 days earlier. Our thought was, \u9225\u6de5f course there are going to be glitches and things to work out\u9225\ue6dahings happen even in established resorts.\u9225?We arrived early evening to find we had to wait for our room. We thought check-in was at 3 pm, and by now it was almost 9 pm and still no room. No problem, we thought\u9225\ue6d2et\u9225\u6a9a just go for a drink! We finally get a room but no key\u9225\ue6dde were told a guard would let us in. (we didn\u9225\u6a9b get a key for over 24 hrs and had trouble at times finding our guard) ANYWAY\u9225?we were thrilled to throw our stuff down and get a start on our vacation! We didn\u9225\u6a9b want to waste a minute! As soon as we walked in our room we had a HUGE WELCOME TO PUNTA CANA ! No, not rose petals on the floor leading to the bed\u9225\ue6d4ope, not a bottle of champagne\u9225\ufe39\u20ac?nope\u9225\ue6d4ot a running jacuzzi\u9225\ufe39\u20ac\ufe39\u20ac\ufe39\u20ac?.nope\u9225\ue6d4ot a fruit basket and chocolates! It was a swarm of mosquitos!! Yicks we said\u9225\ue6dahey must have put us in the wrong room\u9225?we didn\u9225\u6a9b request the \u9225\u6e0fungle safari special\u9225?!! My husband is great at swatting bugs so he grabbed the only towel in the room and surely woke up the people next door! As soon as he killed some\u9225\ue6d3ore appeared!!! I let him have fun while I refreshened up! Y IPPY! I get to throw on some new clothes and start partying! I go into the bathroom and oops\u9225\ue6dahe toilet does not work. It is old\u9225\ue6d2ooks original from at least 2 resorts ago\u9225\ue6ceas huge rust stains in the toilet and on the seat, and there is water on the floor. I won\u9225\u6a9b mention what else was floating around! I thought to myself, \u9225\u6e09mmm, I thought this place was newly remodeled. \u9225?I see a new sink and bed and some new paint on the wall, a new flat screen TV, but that\u9225\u6a9a it. Oh well! As we start to inspect the room we see a mini fridge that is full\u9225\ue6bfEAH! But as we grab a beer it is warm! Oh no! The fridge doesn\u9225\u6a9b work!!! I settle in for some TV watchin\u9225?as my husband keeps swatting and DARN! No remote! The nice big flat screen is so inviting\u9225\ue6c8ut when I turned it on it was SNOWY! It reminded me of what I came to Punta Cana for\u9225\ue6dao get away from the SNOW !!!!No worries I think\u9225?I\u9225\u6a92l let my husband keep practicing his karate moves and I\u9225\u6a92l order room service! Yummy\u9225\ue6af love room service\u9225?and look and look\u9225\ue6c7nd see no menu. No big deal I think\u9225\ue6af guess that means I can order whatever I want! I keep looking and realize there is NO PHONE! I finally convince my husband it is time to stop the killing spree and we go to reception. As we leave we realize the door does not shut! The door is too big for the jam. We leave it open and hope our things are safe.I speak Spanish so I skip to reception knowing in my heart they will take care of us\u9225?.it\u9225\u6a9a our anniversary of course! I smile and tell the man behind the counter my issues. Mainly the toilet. He says. \u9225\u6e1forry mame, we have no room to give you. We are all booked up. Don\u9225\u6a9b worry we will fix your toilet in a couple days!! \u9225?A COUPLE DAYS I THINK? OH NO!! I try for the next few hours to speak to anyone who would listen, but to no avail. We walk back to our room with our heads hung low. As we get to our room we notice the door is now SHUT. Hmm\u9225\ue6d3aybe we are just at the wrong room we think\u9225?.nope\u9225?..we are at the right room. We look for the guard\u9225\ue6c7nd the hall is dark. There is no one in sight. We walk back to reception and tell them our predicament. They PROMISE they will send the guard to open our room. This ritual of walking back and forth goes on for at least 45 mins! Finally, the guard appears and tells us, \u9225\u6e19h, its easy, you have to move the door this way, then this way, then do this and then this\u9225\ue6c7nd SEE, NOW IT WILL OPEN and CLOSE! (good thing I took notes during that!!!)Anyway\u9225\ufe39\u20ac\ufe39\u20ac\ufe39\u20ac\ue6d3y husband finally made progress with the guys at reception and we were moved to a much nicer room. Our first day was pretty much a waste. Hey! Look on the bright side\u9225?. we got lots of exercise walking back and forth from building 6 to reception!! We were given a nice suite in building 5. It had a couple problems too. (toilet ran non stop) We named this room the \u9225\u6e1eainforest room\u9225?! Who would have thought we would have our own waterfall in our room! (leaky ceiling!) After we got settled in our room my husband realized he left something in the \u9225\u6e0fungle safari\u9225?room. He went back and knocked on the door. A young couple had just arrived and were very upset with the mosquitoes and non functioning toilet. They said, \u9225\u6e09urry...come on in\u9225\ue6d9hut the door\u9225\ue6dde don\u9225\u6a9b want to let any more mosquitoes in here!\u9225?I know I have been light hearted so far as I write this review , so here are some comments in a more serious tone:Let\u9225\u6a9a review our first room disaster: Why would this resort put another couple in our same room, less than 12 hrs later when the room wasn\u9225\u6a9b ready?? We spoke to the other couple a day later and they had to move\u9225\ue6ddhy? The mosquitoes, no phone, fridge broken, TV not working, and toilet did not work. This type of attitude from Dreams that \u9225\u6de5h well, maybe we can just find a sucker to take that room who won\u9225\u6a9b say anything,\u9225?is NOT acceptable and cannot be overlooked.I was getting change at reception when a woman who had checked in 8 hours prior and was thrilled to get her room, came back very upset. She put the key on the counter and said, \u9225\u6deair, this room has people in it\u9225\ue6dahey were in bed!\u9225?She received no reaction from the man behind the counter. Not even a simple apology. I saw her the next day and she got a new room 4 hours later but had no hot water. I told her that she and her family were welcome to use our bathroom/shower. We had a great trip despite the unexpected weather, the bad food in the buffet and the initial room disaster. The food in the restaurants varied, but overall was very good and MUCH better than the buffet. We loved the sushi in the Asian restaurant as well as the seaside grill and Italian place. The French restaurant was not good for us. The service improved every day that we were there. Although this resort has been renovated it appears to be sporadic. Some new items, some original. Some of the toilets are not new, some of the showers are not either. Some guests think of ALL NEW when they hear a resort has been renovated. The quality of \u9225\u6e18ew items\u9225?is average so I do not see this place holding up well. The lamps are wobbly, doors don\u9225\u6a9b close properly, chairs are flimsy in certain areas, the cloth on pool chairs is already coming off the foam. I say within a year this place will not look like it has been renovated and will quickly show wear and tear.I can\u9225\u6a9b stress enough\u9225?when we arrived at DPB I could care less that we had no flowers in the vases, no binder notebook on the resort offerings, no toilet paper holder, no hooks, no do not disturb sign, no evening turn down service, bad a/c. We were even ok with no working TV, mini fridge that didn\u9225\u6a9b worked, original shower and toilet even though this place was renovated, no darking curtains, flooding hallways and ceilings, lack of booze at times esp. vodka, having to wait hours for a room, lack of beach towels at times as early as noon, beach with seaweed and cigarette butts\u9225?all of that was tolerable and understandable since they just opened\u9225?.what I could not accept was being in a room infested with mosquitoes and one without a working toilet and told \u9225\u6e19h, miss, it will be fixed in a couple days\u9225?we have no place to put you.\u9225?That, plus knowing they put another young couple in that room without fixing it\u9225\ue6dahat lack of integrity showed me I do not want to patron DREAMS resorts in the future.We heard and observed all sorts of things during our stay. I feel the people we met were kind hearted, caring people and were respectful with the staff. The travelers I met had the same thought we did when we arrived\u9225?and did not expect perfection\u9225?A TOILET MAYBE, BUT NOT PERFECTION) They just wanted a nice, simple vacation with a comfortable room for their family. Period.We had a great trip despite all the drama\u9225\ue6dde liked and disliked some things, were disappointed and surprised with other things , and concerned for others while we were here. On a positive note\u9225?we did meet a few people that had no horror stories. They said \u9225\u6e28e feel lucky compared to others. \u9225?So, of course\u9225\ue6d9ome families were perfectly content. They all had minor issues whether it be an issue in the room or with the food, but like all trips, you take those things in stride.I feel very lucky that we were eventually moved to a nicer room and I let the management know on numerous occasions how pleased we were. Our last day there we had to wait over 6 hrs in the lobby (we had fun!) and what I observed and heard as people were coming and going really surprised me. (I\u9225\u6a92l leave it at that) I am thinking there will be a flood of new posts on TA within the next month or two.Important note to those going to DBP soon: There is ONE thing you just can\u9225\u6a9b forget to bring\u9225\ufe39\u20ac?.and that is a GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. You will definitely need it!After being home and reflecting, we laugh about how much fun we had in Punta Cana. I love the country, the people and their spirit. I loved speaking Spanish while I was there and meeting people from all over the world. Bottom line:What kind of resort would \u9225?.-put a guest in a room that is not ready to be occupied and then tell try to convince you to stay in that room?-tell you over and over a \u9225\u6e08uard\u9225?is in the building at all times and will let you in, when in reality no one was there!-put another couple in a room that they KNOW is not acceptable?-boast to guests at check in and in their manual that they have \u9225\u6e13ate check out\u9225?and they encourage you to ask about it at reception. When you do, they chuckle and say \u9225\u6df2e don\u9225\u6a9b\u9225?offer that service. Who told you that?\u9225?br/>-tell you they have a hospitality room in building 2 for people who check out at noon but do not leave until evening? Then, when you ask to use this room to shower, they say, \u9225\u6df2e don\u9225\u6a9b have such a room, go use the bathroom in the spa.\u9225?br/>Let\u9225\u6a9a look at it this way: let\u9225\u6a9a say you go to a new car dealership in your town. Everyone is excited about the new car place\u9225\ue6dahey are offering great deals and all sorts of things to attract you to their dealership! You get there\u9225\ue6c7nd find out the car they have advertised is not available. You are so upset\u9225\ue6dahis is the CAR of your DREAMS! You ask them when it will arrive and they say, oh, not sure, but we will get back to you. You say, \u9225\u6f1but your ad said it would be here today and ready to test drive!\u9225?You are told, sorry, not much we can do. So, you move on to another vehicle you like and ask to take it for a test drive. It sure looks like the one in the ad from this morning\u9225\u6a9a paper\u9225?.you hop in excited to finally be able to take it for a spin! You quickly find out it has no a/c or heat, no radio, no power steering, no seat belts\u9225\ue6d4ot even windshield wipers. Gee you think\u9225\ue6a7LL cars have windshield wipers, don\u9225\u6a9b they? It doesn\u9225\u6a9b matter\u9225?you still like the car and want to see what else it has to offer. As you look down, and try to put the car in reverse you are perplexed\u9225?no reverse? You ask the salesperson, hey, what\u9225\u6a9a going on here; He says, \u9225\u6f2eh, that\u9225\u6a9a not a problem. Who needs reverse anyway. \u9225?You say, hey, this is not the car you have advertised! This isn\u9225\u6a9b the one I saw in your PICTURE? It doesn\u9225\u6a9b have anything you said it did in your ad! And he says, \u9225\u6e28ell, you know \u9225\ufe39\u20ac?we just opened so we don\u9225\u6a9b have those yet and I know\u9225\ue6dde still have some kinks to work out\u9225?and besides\u9225\ue6cfts nice on the outside, isn\u9225\u6a9b it? \u9225?You ask if maybe the price will be cheaper since it is missing all these basic amenities and the salesperson laughs out loud and says \u9225\u6dda\u9225\u6a93 sorry sir, we just can\u9225\u6a9b do that. We have such a demand for these cars, and we have no room to negotiate. \u9225\u6df5ou walk away in dismay\u9225?and as you get in your car you see family after family going through exactly what you just did\u9225\ue6cceeling duped!Ok, I think you get my point. This dealership would be out of business within a week!!Ok, now back to DPB: in conclusion\u9225\ufe39\u20ac\ufe39\u20ac?The lack of integrity is what bothers me most about Dreams Palm Beach. It would have been so refreshing to hear a staff member say :\u9225\u6e15ame, you should not have been given that room. It was not ready, we are sorry and we will fix this situation for you.\u9225?OR,  \u9225\u6e15ame, we do state that we have late check-out in our guest resort book but we do not offer that service yet.\u9225?OR, \u9225\u6dda know we offered the hospitality room to you, but it is not available now. \u9225?A simple, honest answer when things go wrong is what people want, not the run around.The bottom line for me\u9225\ufe39\u20ac?DPB lacks what would be needed for my return visit\u9225\ufe39\u20ac?\u9225\ue6afNTEGRITY.", "Date": "Dec 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR218135804", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "VivaChile"}, {"Content": "Beautiful pools - needed a lot more than 25 million dollars renovation Also just came back and was also disppointed.I chose the prefered room.

Management had workers put towels next to everyones door, and they were cleaning it up.I did not like the fact that there was a shower stall instead of a tub. It's much easier to bathe kids in a tub without taking a shower yourself. Also I did not care for the design of the bathroom-- that the toilet+shower is in a seperate room, or partition from the sink. The beds were very comfortable- the only (+) about the room.Service: Overall needs improvement in responsibility about fulfilling customers requests. It seems when asked-whether at the restaurant or room concerns- workers always get someone else to look into it. Especially this phenomenon is evident in restaurants. We order drinks and the server would tell another server or worker to get the drinks for our table. I'm not sure if they have assigned tables or work around the room, but a lot of requests go unfufilled and many drinks we did not get.The evening entertainment at the lounge sounded like the worst karioke (I heard distant dogs howling).Few good restaurants that fall under the all-inclusive: A Japanese one and another one called The Patio open for evening dining. Men have a dress code-no open-toe shoes or shorts (depends who is the host that evening), women on the other hand can get in wearing next to nothing- daisy dukes and flip-flops--I did not like this double standard.Would not recommend this resort", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR316408478", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "queenof8"}, {"Content": "Simply put - a great holiday We have arrived to the Dreams Palm Beach hotel on 13th of December in its opening day after reconstruction. We spent here a great week of our family vacation. As of the beginning of our stay here everything act to us with very positive impression. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.We were accommodated in the first block just in front of the beach. Room was very nice and reasonably equipped. Perhaps the beds were too soft. We should only comment on the room service. Cleaning the rooms was usually after 3PM. Our minibar was not completed once during our stay. Catering was absolutely excellent. Breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet in the restaurant were great and varied. We spent nice time in the lobby bar, where the bartenders prepared excellent long drinks. Inside the hotel are two swimming pools. Around them are plenty of sunbeds with beach towels. The beach in front of the hotel is very nice covered with white sand. On the beach are grown palm trees that provide shadow. Under palms are plenty of sunbeds for all clients. The beach is cleaned every day by hotel staff. This wonderful beach is reserved only for the hotel guests and there are no local vendors bothering by offering their souvenirs. The water in the sea is very nice and clear. After about 500 meters north of the hotel beach begins wild beach, which extends about 6 km to the main hotel area in Playa Bavaro. Dreams Palm Beach Hotel is located in a quiet location along with other 3 hotels and is an ideal place for those who want to spend a peaceful holiday.", "Date": "Dec 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR347000545", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "naviivan"}, {"Content": "Good idea, poor performance We just came back from the hotel. In general the experience was positive, the amenities are very nice. However, there were way too many small problems like: no straws at the resort on our first day (Dec17), no ice (dec 23) so kids could not order any cold drinks, no hot water in the room (twice during 7 days stay), no water in the public washrooms( several times). Our bed was broken, and took 3 days to chase the maintenance to fix it...To sum up:Kids club - very good 5/5 open till 22:00!!!

Check-in was prompt and we were warmly welcomed by the staff. Shown to a beaufiful room overlooking the pool. Lots of chairs and huts on the beach so no reason to get up early in the morning and reserve chairs. We have eaten at several of the restaurants since arriving and the food and service are the very best we have ever had at any resort. It is almost as if AMResorts has taken the very best of their Dreams properties and combined it all into this one. The entertainment staff keep things jumping all day and the bar located in the main lobby is a jumping spot in the evening with the best and most entertaining bartenders I have ever seen.Problems? A few minor things that I have heard from guests such as a telephone not working or the AC needing repair in a room. (we had this problem and it was repaired promptly). Need room service? 20 minutes from ordering to your room. I have spoken with many guests since arriving and have not heard one major complaint; any minor ones were promptly tended to. Actually, I have been thoroughly impressed that with having only been open a week before we arrived that the resort was up and functioning at 100%.Cannot say enough about the staff who are thoroughly trained in the restaurants, activities area (including the Explorer's Club for younger children), grounds maintenance, bars, etc. Service is always friendly and prompt.We will be heading home on Dec. 27 and will most certainly be returning again next year to Dreams Punta Cana.
