{"Reviews": [{"Content": "shabby We broke our flight to Sydney with an overnight stay, both ways, at the Hotel Royal. On the way out, it was OK. Not smart, a bit shabby, but all we wanted was a bed for us, a bed for our 3yr old and a cot for our 1yr old. The cot was broken so we asked for another one and they replaced it straight away. Friendly people. On our return, two weeks later, things didn't go well. The room was not ready when we arrived at 3.30pm and we had to wait over half an hour with exhausted children. They gave us a complimentary drink in the restaurant, but we quickly found that only coffee or synthetic yuk drinks. Certainly no fresh fruit juice. The room was was OK. The bathroom wasn't particularly clean (dusty, someone else's hair on the hair-dryer base) and the same broken cot in the room, so we complained. We survived, but we won't go back.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR901142103", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Zing1"}, {"Content": "Standard hotel in reasonable location Booked through Singapore Airlines Stopover holiday, this hotel is conveniently located for Orchard Rd shopping.

I didn't want anything fancy and I didn't get anything fancy. I reckon I paid about $90 for this hotel. When I got there, they gave me a smoking room but it smelt quite bad so had to get this changed. I am an agent so I know I requested Non smoking. They moved me quite happily and I got upgraded to a suite of some description- the room was huge- had 2 single beds- but was just me so no drama. There are no bells and whistles with this hotel. The breakfast is basic yet functional. It's a bed for the night. If you are looking at staying longer in Singapore then try the Peninsular Excelsior- not far from Raffles and is a good value 3*. Not too far from a metro station ( 10 minutes walk??) so accessible to transport. Not my favourite place to stay but hey I didn't pay much for it.

We had our two year old with us and so three people in the room and only gave us two towels. Breakfast was powered egg and broiled ham, so not my idea of a good full buffet breakfast. The bath didn't hold any water because the plug was broken, cockroaches if you turned on the light at night and scared them, annoying elevator music played continually all throughout the night and you could hear people coming and going rather easily.

No suitable bar in this place however I was told to walk a block down the road as their was a nice english bar where I could get a drink rather than going into the ladies of the night bar adjacent the main reception.

I booked this room on HotelClub which I have used with great success in the past throughout Asia. In this case it was a terrible mistake. The room smelled horrible, was dirty and stained. Furthermore, and most important, the air conditioning had two settings - on or off. On was way too cold and off was (as expected in a tropical climate) unacceptably hot. The hotel solution was an offer to give me more blankets. I checked out before staying one night and stayed at Traders Hotel at double the price. When I checked out of Hotel Royal, the clerk told me they would bill me for one night. I called Hotelclub and also went online to cancel the reservation. This was to no avail as I later discovered that Hotel Royal invoiced Hotelclub for the full stay. I am still negotiating with Hotelclub, filed a complaint with Hotel Royal and will file a complaint with the Singapore Tourist Board.

The turnover of tour groups that comes through this hotel must be quite large as it seemed to me that the hotel lobby was always filled with tour groups and their luggage either coming or going. In the evenings, the small lobby's ambience was not helped at all by its Karaoke Bar which had photos of female hostesses posted at the Bar's entrance. The hotel restaurant was again, just adequate in terms of space, service and overall food quality. The one thing going for the hotel is that it is located just a few minutes from a subway stop so that it was easy to get around if the hotel itself is not centrally located. There are also small shopping areas within walking distance. The hotel happened to have been booked for us and was thus not our choice. While we did not have a bad stay, I am quite certain we would choose a different hotel the next time we go to Singapore.
