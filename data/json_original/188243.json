First, the location in unbeatable. It's a 10-minute walk to the Skytrain, Canada Place and the waterfront, and a 15-minute walk to Robson Street. The room was small, but it was clean and that's what mattered. The bathroom was a nice size as well and had a window, which was nice. We got there hours before check-in and they had a room available for us. I read reviews of this place where people complained about the elevator being slow and small, and while it is tiny, we never had to wait for it. Maybe it's because we were there during shoulder season and it was just the two of us, but I don't think we shared the elevator with anyone else during our entire stay. The front desk and valet were incredibly nice and helpful. My only complaint is the nighttime desk employee who gave us very vague directions when I asked her for directions to the nearest Skytrain station, since we were going to take that to the airport the next morning. Her, pointing west: \"It's about two blocks that way and then up a little ways.\" Me: What's the name of the station? Her: Oh, it's the last stop. Ummm, yeah, not helpful. Seeing as though we're staying in a hotel, I think it's safe to assume that we're VISITING and do not know the names of the stations or the train lines. I rolled my eyes and went to bed and asked the morning-shift employee who said, \"You go out the front door and make a left. Go about two blocks to Granville and turn left, and the station called Canada Line will be right in front of you. Take it to southbound to the YVR stop, which is the airport.\" Thank you! Now really, was that so hard? Besides that little hiccup, I have absolutely no complaints about the Days Inn Downtown Vancouver. It's walking distance to everything. You can do what we did: walk to the waterfront, take the Sea Walk all the way to -- and through -- Stanley Park, then walk to Robson Street and hang out/people watch/shop/eat/drink then walk back to the hotel. It's an entire day but well worth the experience. Also, check out Joey on Burrad, a bar/grill a hop, skip and a jump from the hotel that does a great job of maintaining a hip, cool vibe without it being too trendy or pretentious.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cWell Sited, Comfortable for a short stay.\u201d", "Author": "mcavty", "ReviewID": "UR119374336", "Content": "Right in the heart of downtown close by tourist attractions, waterfront & cruise ship terminals, this hotel is value for money.

This is an older hotel that has been very well renovated and looks stunning! Clean, bright lobby. Check in was smooth. Very friendly and welcoming staff that were very knowledgeable about the city. Room was great- clean and tidy. Washroom was perfect and looked new. Consistent pressure and temperature. Nice towels and sheets- they did not cheap out. Free Wi-Fi in the hotel, which worked flawless. Room had TV with decent channel line-up and a mini fridge that was whisper quiet. Safe in room is a good idea. Close to Sky Train stations! The hotel is in an area that is pretty safe, and having lived in Vancouver previously for a year- I knew what to expect. This was a good area in a safe neighborhood... however a freak accident really set this hotel, staff and its guests apart from any other stay. I had just gotten back from meetings and was taking a taxi back... the taxi overshot the hotel and dropped my off on the other side of Hornby St. I was walking back with my laptop case over my shoulder and was steps away from the hotel. I guess I was watching a man pushing something down the street that I did not see what happened, but some low life hooligan threw me to the ground an kicked me in the leg and tried grabbing my laptop bag. It had wound itself around my arm so this person was trying to rip my arm off to get my laptop. I tried in vein to push the bag off my arm while screaming for help that seemed an eternity... finally the bag came off and the thug was gone, but next thing I know the thug is being attacked on the street in front of the hotel. Guests and staff came streaming out of the hotel doors and the wannabe thug is being attacked himself. I see him and several people run off. I remember a staff member, male, in uniform lifting me off the sidewalk and helping me to the hotel. I don't remember his name or face... but thank God for him. They brought me to the lobby. Several people from the Lounge had heard about the robbery and came out to my defense. Next thing I know a person in a cowboy hat with rolled up sleeves brings me my laptop. He did not have to risk his life for it. Another staff member called Police and several officers came by. I went to stay with friends in Kamloops that night. A co-worker checked me out in the morning. I never got a chance to say thank-you to the staff member that helped me or the other guests at the hotel that came to my aid, and the cowboy that retrieved my computer. I sent a letter to the manager praising his night employees. This is a nice hotel in a good area, but like any downtown big city- you need to stay street wise, and make sure you know what is going on around you.

We were in Vancouver for the day, looking to do a bit of shopping & sightseeing, and have a nice walk along the harbor by Canada Place. We needed a hotel that was close to Robson Street, ideally a little closer to the water, and we had a tight budget. We didn't need a pool, a gym, or anything extra beyond a nice, comfortable sleep. The Days Inn hit the spot on all of those criteria, so we booked ourselves in for a night. We arrived by SkyTrain (Canada Line), which had a stop very close by (just a few blocks' walk). We walked into a cozy (yep, I guess that means \"small\") lobby, and were greeted immediately by the friendly front desk agent, who had us checked in within about 2 minutes. Very quick. As we headed to the elevator, the porter showed us a few quick tips on how to use the key card. We were impressed that he took the time to show us. Whether or not we actually \"needed\" the advice, I don't know, but we followed his instructions and had no problems, so we'll give him the benefit of the doubt. It was a nice gesture, regardless. Our room had a nice \"urban\" view. No, that doesn't mean we were looking into the office building next door. We actually had a very pleasant view down one of the roads (Burrard???) onto some two- or three-story tall piece of modern art (had some modern looking blocks that moved up and down every few minutes). The hotel was close to Canada Place, so we went for a nice little walk in that area, past the Olympic torch and down into the harbour. We returned via Robson Street, which was buzzing with activity, as usual. We booked a meal at The Keg restaurant, which was a few blocks from the hotel. After the meal, we returned to the room for a little shut eye. The room was very clean. We watched a little TV before bed. The hotel had a new flat screen LCD TV, and a nice little dock for my iPod to charge. It didn't charge my iPhone 4 (not compatible) but that's not a negative in any way... just an extra little nicety that didn't work out. The Internet was free, so that more than made up for it. Our sleep was completely peaceful. Our room was almost next door to the elevator, and we didn't hear a thing. We didn't hear traffic either. Nothing! It was very good. The bed was very comfortable, especially the nice and heavy duvet. We requested a late checkout (12 noon) - no problems. Checkout itself took about 20 seconds. We had no incidentals, so that certainly helped. For what we were looking for, the Days Inn Downtown was perfect for us. A peaceful night's sleep in a clean hotel, close to attractions. If you're looking for a luxury stay, this might not be your hotel, but if you're looking for a nice little budget hotel in a good location - you can't go wrong at the Days Inn.

Being just a couple of blocks from Robson or the Waterfront makes this an ideal spot for tourists. Leave the car at home, you won't need it! But the absolute best part is the incredible value. The price is reasonable and all of the staff are courteous and attentive. The rooms are modern, clean, and spacious complete with 37\" flat screen televisions! I was upgraded to a suite and loved having the sofa, microwave, and mini fridge. The mini fridge even included free bottled water! I also love that it's not a business hotel that 'nickels and dimes' you to pay for internet like the higher end brands - it's free! Even though you're right in the heart of downtown, the location is extremely quiet because it's in the financial district....but you're never too far away from the action.

I had checked people in for my company at the Days Inn during the 1980's and 1990s as it was the most reasonable cost hotel in the downtown core. It still is. It's old. There is no hiding it. That's not by default a bad thing. It can be charming and mmemorable. They have done a great job to try to keep it retro-ed and updated. But there is only so much you can do. My room was small. Most seem to surround the elevator doors and the noise that comes with middle aged, middle management folks cut loose in the city on an expense account to go to a conference a couple of blocks away at the Trade and Convention Centre can be an issue. I was in room 303(?) with the bright light outside the window illuminating the front street sign outside my window. Other than being woken up as the post dinner meeting crowd tumbling out of the elevator 3 metres from my door at 11 pm, I woke up repeatedly thinking it was a sunny day in Vancouver as the outside lamp burned holes around the curtains all night. Breakfast cost $20. I checked out in the AM with a $200 bill (inc breakfast, off season Oct 4 2010). I think that's a deal for the Vancouver downtown core. But I prefer a short Skytrain ride to the burbs and a nicer hotel with big rooms and modern facilities for less than half the price. If staying downtown is your preference and you are not looking for an epic hotel experience and you are looking to save a few bucks by finding a cheap downtown hotel, the Days Inn is OK. I'm not fussy in hotels. I travel over 200 days a year. Hotels are for me are pure utility. Sleep, food, clean, internet, quiet... at a decent price. Forget the spa and aroma therapy and bed turndown service (I like to lie in bed in my tighty whities watching TV usually when the nice lady knocks on the door to turn down the bed. It's not a pleasant visual. Don't dwell on it).

The cost of the room at the Days Inn was a fraction of the conference rate at the Hyatt. The rooms featured basic amenities but I was pleasantly surprised to find a flat screen TV and refrigerator with complimentary bottled water. The internet service is good and if you don't have your own computer, they have a complimentary business centre in the lobby. Service could use some improvement. Many of their staff left an indifferent taste in my mouth. However, the Asian female front desk clerk that checked me out was exceptional. The standard rooms with 2 double beds are somewhat small but I do know from other colleagues who booked the same room type that the hotel does have larger versions than the one I was booked into so don't hesitate to ask the Front Desk to move you to a larger room.

Room service and valet services are contracted out, meaning that things cannot be charged to the room and service quality is poor and bordering on rude. Food is pretty disappointing as well. Coming from a customer service background I usually have a pretty high tolerance for this kind of thing but I felt throughout my stay that they thought they were doing me a favour by letting me stay in their hotel. Can only assume this reflects a company that doesn't treat their staff particularly well. Overall, if you are looking for a place to crash and not spend much time in the hotel, you could do worse (ie. no rats/cockroaches, rooms in reasonably good repair/cleanliness).

The Days Inn in Downtown vancouver meets those basic needs. It is reasonably priced for a downtown hotel (although tends away from budget to mid-range during the summer months). I have stayed here approximately twice a year for the past five years without problem. The basics: * Area: Vancouver has a very scary area; this hotel is comfortably outside of that area by 2-3 blocks. It is in the financial area so tends to be pretty dead in the evenings and weekends, but is safe. It is a few blocks to the nearest convenience store. * Noise: the street outside is not a particularly busy one, plus you'll probably be facing a wall on the side rather than the street. It is in the city centre though, so some minor traffic noise. I've very rarely heard noises from the corridor or other rooms. * Cleanliness: very good, never had a problem with the rooms, bathrooms or beds. But there are a few other things to know about this hotel: * Rooms are small, I mean SMALL. Not New York small, but not generous by any means. The bathrooms are tiny. * Most rooms look out the side of the building, straight onto a blank wall. You can just about see some sky if you look straight up. A few rooms at the front look out over the street, but these are a bit noisier (from the street) and lighter (from the giant yellow Days Inn sign). * Parking is but valet only, at about CAD$15/day. You can go in and out as much as you like, but this is not super convenient. * The elevator is tiny and slow. * Stairs wind around the elevator, so you end up walking much further than normal back-and-forth stair well, and even get a bit dizy. * TVs aren't very large, and have a strange, separate channel changer box (with remote). * Curtains are okay thinkness for keeping light out, but are absolutely minimal height so there is lots of light leaking in under the curtain. Normally to stop this in other hotels I push the curtain onto the window sill to keep out the light, but the curtains here only just reach the sill. Also they are cutout around the air conditioner (which is usually in the window). * No pull-in area outside the hotel, so when arriving by car just park on the street and run inside to check-in and give the keys to the valet. * No free breakfast It is not all bad though: * Safe area * Quiet * Clean * Walking distance to downtown attractions (gastown, cruise terminal, harbour tower, Robson street, Granville Street). * Very close to buses (on Burrard and Granville) * Very close to Skytrain (Burrard St) * In-room safe * Elevator requires room key (so a little bit more secure than hotels with open access to the room floors) * Valet parking is usually sufficiently quick to retreive cars, even when several people are leaving at the same time Overall, I recommend this hotel if you want to stay downtown at a more reasonable price.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot the best stay\u201d", "Author": "Michimi", "ReviewID": "UR5576541", "Content": "The room was very clean and the size decent but it was way too expensive for what we received.
