The liquor store in the gift shop had our favorite table wine for 25% less than NH State liquor stores! And, even the Steak & Shake alternative inside had good food at good prices.

We chose it for proximity to LAS and price. It was intended to be just a place to sleep, with easy access to the airport the following morning, but ended up being a pleasant mini-getaway with unexpected amenities. Upon arrival all of the staff, beginning with valet parking to bell desk and registration were very friendly and efficient. We were surprised at the large size of both the bedroom/sitting area and bathroom. It was nicely appointed and very clean. This was a standard room at their lowest rate of $50. We had a late lunch in their Mexican restaurant, Baja Miguel's. The price was $10 ea. that included a large plate entree (mine was chicken taco, relleno, rice & beans) chips, salsa, bean dip, guacamole and a margarita. It was all very good and the service was excellent. We wandered into the equestrian center where a show horse exhibition was taking place. That was fun to watch as was browsing the booths of beautiful western gear for both horses and humans. We also enjoyed the plaques and memorabilia of rodeo champions and the \"bigger than life\" bronze statue of Benny Binion on horseback. We then went to a movie in their multi-theater complex and watched the bowlers in the bowling complex. Later in the evening we had a light dinner in the Coronado Cafe. The menu offered a variety of choices, both North American and Asian. The service was lovely and the prices were very reasonable. The bed and bedding was comfortable, the flat screen TV good, the wake-up service prompt and check-out simple. When we returned from our New Orleans visit, 9 days later, a South Point \"Thank-you for staying with us\" email was waiting with an offering for a future stay of $50 for the first night and 2nd. night free. We live 3 hours north of Las Vegas so will definitely take advantage of it. The property offers a wide variety of activities and events with something for everyone, including families.

From the freeway, the hotel looks very lovely lit up at night, and it has always signaled that we are approaching Las Vegas. However, in January my daughter was scheduled to participate in an athletic event held at the hotel, so I booked a one-night stay for a very reasonable (by Las Vegas standards) rate. The hotel is conveniently located off the 15 with plenty of free parking either out in front or in the parking garage. Check-in went quickly, but as mentioned by previous reviewers, it was a bit of a hike to schlep all of the suitcases, extra coats, gym bag and competition clothes through the casino to the hotel elevators. The room was large, clean, and pleasantly decorated. I liked the fact that the toilet/bath was separated by a door from the sinks/vanity area. Unfortunately, there was no mini-fridge or microwave which is always a plus for those travelers who are spending more time in Vegas. The various restaurants looked appealing, but my daughter wanted to eat at the Garden Buffet. I took a few minutes to join the player's club (me, the non-gambler!), which allowed us to eat for half price at the buffet. There were many choices, and we had fun sampling the different world cuisines. Because my daughter needed to get a good night's sleep, we didn't try to drive up to the Strip. For those athletes who had already competed and didn't need to get to bed early, there was a bowling alley and a movie theater located within the hotel itself. Because there is no automatic resort fee, the next morning I had to go to the front desk to sign up to use the fitness room. While it's great that you are not charged for amenities you don't use, the fitness room fee combined with the wi-fi fee is about equivalent to the resort fee charged at other hotels. The fitness room itself was large and empty with towels and water available. For breakfast I went to Seattle's Best in the lobby for Chai lattes and bagels to take back to the room. Many of the other athlete's parents must have had the same idea since the line was very, very long. All in all I was pleasantly surprised by my stay at the South Point hotel. There were only a few negatives. In my particular room, the blackout blinds did not completely cover the edges of the window so the outside light seeped inside making it difficult for me to sleep. If I had remembered to pack my eye mask this wouldn't have been a problem. Also I found the pillow to be extremely stiff. I'm sure if I had called down to housekeeping they would have sent up another pillow, but I just didn't want to be bothered. Finally, as someone else has mentioned, the smoke in the casino is pervasive. But this is Las Vegas and to be expected unless you go to a non-smoking hotel. Usually I just try to avoid second-hand smoke, but unfortunately at one point we were trapped in the slow-moving line to get into the buffet while a man smoked nearby. Still, I would return to the South Point Hotel, especially if my daughter competes there again next year.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cvery comfortable\u201d", "Author": "loelou", "ReviewID": "UR126759855", "Content": "This was a great place to stay a short distance from the strip, my husband and I were travelling around the USA and found this hotel had everything", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irving, Texas", "Title": "\u201cRelatively Excellent\u201d", "Author": "brentp999", "ReviewID": "UR126716936", "Content": "If you don't need or want to stay on the strip South Point Hotel is an excellent choice.

I came as part of a convention. It was a great place for a convention as you could come here and never have to leave. The convention space was big and nice. The food in the convention was the best food I have ever had at a convention. I enjoyed the convention area being up and away from the casino so you felt like you were getting away from it. The rooms were awesome. I was by myself and I had a huge room. I especially enjoyed the couch. I like to read at night and hate trying to sit up and read in bed. It had a big bathroom. Also the shower was seperated from the sink area and I can see how that would be helpful if you had more than one person getting ready at a time. The air conditioning unit was quiet. To quite for me as I sleep with a fan at home and it was to quiet in my hotel room! I used the shuttle to and from the airport and had no trouble with this. I had to wait just a little when I got in for the shuttle but worth not having to pay for a cab for me. I did not use the shuttle down to the strip as I am not a person that would enjoy the strip,but others did and said it was easy. One of the best things in the hotel was the gift shop. If you want to get much cheaper alcohol then that is the place to go. They had my favorite bottle of wine for 12 dollars which is much cheaper than I could get it at home. So enjoyed that in my room. Great selections of wine, beer and other alcohol. Everyone here seemed to be friendly to me. I ate at the Del Mar Deli when I got there. It was a little slow, but the food was reasonable and good. Didn't expect to find places in Vegas with reasonable food. Also, ate breakfast one morning at Coranoado Cafe. It was ok, not the best food ever but definately not the worst. I really enjoyed a dinner at Don Vito's. The gnocchi was awesome and neat atmosphere. I was disapointed that the mexican place was not open on Mondays and Tuesdays as that is when I was there. But had other choices. I did get room service one night and the food was awlful. So I would stick to the restaurants. I am not really a gambler so did not go to the casino much. It was smoky, but less than the other casinos I have been in. I did not like the smoke smell but could stand it. Once you got past the casino in the hotel part I never did smell smoke though. As said before, if you want to the stip experience not the place to go. But a good place for conventions as reasonable for attendents and you can go to the strip if you want.

The main reason I'm writing pretty much the same thing as before is so that people know that it is still as good as it was before. We really feel like we are coming home when we arrive at South Point and look forward to going back! If you are looking for a mad, hangover type of vegas, then SP is probably not for you. If are looking for a holiday in Vegas where you can go in and sample the madness of the strip for some of the time and be able to relax and take in all the rest that Vegas has to offer for the rest of the time, then SP is probably for you. This time we stayed in the Junior 1 bedroom suite again, and at a price that is still significantly lower than any of the other good options in Vegas on the strip. What we love about South Point is the following: a. Friendly, professional, quirky and down to earth staff everywhere. From reception all the way across, South Point staff are lovely and have never let us down. b. Huge big comfortable rooms that are quiet, bright or dark as you prefer. Well appointed bathrooms, clean and well kept. c. Huge big casino with all my favourite slot machines! And no hustle... d. Fantastic choice of restaurants and places to eat. We had been vaguely interested in the Steak and Shake, and this is a brilliant addition. The burgers were excellent. Really excellent. Service is slightly more quirky there... but still very good. Don Vitos Italian - brilliant food. I still haven't found a better fettucine alfredo! Oyster Bar - clam linguine. Yum. Coronado Cafe breakfasts, excellent. Buffet breakfasts and brunches absolutely brilliant as well and incredibly good value. If you have a club card you get even better prices. e. Bowling alley and cinema if you have people who don't want to gamble. f. Pool area not full of intimidating bodies... nice and relaxed New this time - the free wifi in the lobby area. Excellent. Vastly improved shuttle service to the strip - $8 a day for as many round trips as you need. Great. I would not stay at South Point if I wanted to pose and meet \"beautiful people\" - they generally seem to be really nice and down to earth human beings. Lots of cowboys! I would not stay at South Point if I wanted to holler and yell and get manky drunk and dance on the poker table. I would not stay at South Point if I had small kids with me as people like me who like to smoke can smoke pretty much everywhere. And there is a lot of drinking and gambling going on, and cocktail waitresses that might evoke a few questions from young adults. Again, if I could change one thing about South Point it would be to have it be a little closer to Europe so that I could go more often.

I arrived late and had a friend pick me up from the airport to take me to the hotel but was able to utilize the free airport shuttle for my return (Reservations required or you are on a \"Space Available\" status). I arrived around midnight and was checked in promptly by a very nice young lady who offered me a couple of coupon books, generated a duplicate Players Card for me since I forgot to bring mine from home,as well as offered to print my boarding pass for my return trip home.She also let me know of the Strip Shuttle ($8 all day pass) since she knew that I had not rented a vehicle, and let me know of its pick up location and times. I used this service almost everyday that I was there and believe me $8 was well spent. I came and went a fews times during the day and the shuttle drops you off and picks you up at multiple points along the strip. The service to and from the Strip locations were quick and efficient as well as on time. Prior to my arrival I had called the Hotel and had requested 2 beds since my friends would be staying with me for part of my stay. The standard for all hotels booked through a third party is \"All requests cannot be guaranteed\", but the South Point had no problems accomodating my needs. When I arrived to the room, I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the room itself as well as the size of its large bathroom (Separate toilet/shower and sink areas), which makes things a lot easier when multiple persons are trying to get ready at the same time. The rooms were nicely appointed, nice big floor to ceiling windows, and a 42 inch flat panel TV, among other amenities. During this trip I did not utilize any other services besides eating at the buffet and cafe. The buffet is good but not great...I have definitely eaten at worse but it's not the Bellagio nor Wynn buffets but their prices were reasonable (Cheap if you use the 50% off coupon in the coupon book), and the Coronado Cafe, which is open 24 hrs has great food at dirt cheap prices but the catch is that those prices are from 12am-6am and there can be a wait as expected for the quality of food as well as the price. I had the 7oz NY steak and Eggs (Approximately$4) a couple of mornings while I was there. So, after staying there back at the end of December of last year, I received a mailer for several nights stay for free as a Hotel promotion, and since I had a wonderful time there previously, I reserved a room from Feb.28-Mar.3. As part of the promotion I also was given $40 in free slot play and $40 resort credit for use at almost all of the venues within the resort. There is not a Resort Fee but if you want to use the Spa or Fitness Center the cost is $15 per day, but with the promotion it was free as well. The pool and jacuzzi are free, and man, the jacuzzi is nice. The only way I can explain it is that it is 8 jacuzzis fit into the style of a lazy river. I used the jacuzzi everyday that I was there this time and I even layed out next to the pool. I think the locals thought is was a little chilly out but 60-65 degree weather is magnificent to me since I am from Seattle. I was a happy camper! The pool was supposedly heated to 77 degrees but I doubted that, as I quickly did the two feet in and two feet out quickly dance. I also saw a show there (The Dennis Bono Show), I don't know if there is any relationship to Sonny Bono but I never asked. The show is free to Player Club Card holders (Free to join) but you have to obtain a ticket at the Box Office prior to your admittance. I guess I somehow didn't understand this but when I walked into the door and I didn't have my ticket, I was a little embarassed but a very nice older gentleman that worked the door and \"Pat\", at least I think that's what her name was, scanned an extra ticket and allowed me in. I sat in a booth next to a lovely older local couple (Mid 70's if I had to guess) and they treated me as if I was their new best frind. The show is a variety show that is broadcasted via radio each week. I was pleasantly surprised, lots of good singing...I left impressed. So, needless to say I would recommend the South Point! It has alot to offer, from multiple eating establishments, large movie theatre, bowling alley, Spa, Fitness Center, Pool/Jacuzzi, arcade, etc., and I can't forget to mention that next to the Sports Book from 11am-5pm, they have a Hot Dog Stand that serves hot dogs for 75 cents and they even dress it for you. It definitely is a nice establishment and the rooms are huge (500 square feet), and thats just a standard room not the suites. you can't get that much space in Las Vegas very often. The higher the room level, the better the view. My room (2039) had a nice view of the valley and mountains and I got to watch the sun come over the mountains every morning, that's a treat for someone from Seattle.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Paul, MN", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel grows on you!\u201d", "Author": "justinedvm", "ReviewID": "UR125565215", "Content": "I wasn't too pleased to have 3 business trips out to Vegas.

I have stayed in larger rooms but at 2-3 xs more $$. The room was very comfortable and the views from the upper floors are great too. I found the desk with internet connection useful. (fee $13 /day) Outside has a beautiful pool area and not just your regular boring rectangular pool, but a contoured attractive pool area. The place is so large that one can be tempted not to leave. There is not really anything worth walking to around the hotel as it is by itself at the end of some suburbs. The strip is 15-20 minutes away which sounds close but the shuttle service ($8 for all day rides) was difficult to use. We waited for the shuttle only to find there were not enough seats and we had wasted our time. We ended up taking a taxi instead. (~$25-30 with tip) At the South Point, most of the restaurants and bars are mingled among or on the sides of the casino floor. A coupon book for hotel guests lowers the cost of meals or offers free drinks or desserts with your dinner purchaase. Another reviewer enjoyed the Garden Buffet and I have to second that opinion. Everything was great except the Chinese dishes some of which were inedible. But with so much unhealthy food in Vegas, it was nice to have many healthy choices available. I had a large salad and spread peel and eat shrimp over the top, then had a delicious cut of prime rib and lots of fresh fruit for dessert. I also ate at their mexican restaurant. The free margarita was dreadful and the steak dish was poorly spiced with undercooked onions, dry rice and cheese poured over the top. Yuck! They did provide free tortilla chips with 3 dipping options including guacamole The buffet food for the conference was impressively good considering the volume of people they were serving.

They're spacious, fairly modern, and clean. If the low volume of available TV channels concerns you, maybe you're misssing the point of being in Vegas.....you can watch your 400+ channels at home! The casino floor has a 'local feel' but that can serve you well with the lower limit tables. One can bet $25 dollars at a $10 table but not the other way around. So if the shoe goes cold, you can dial back you betting and ride the wave until betting winner skies emerge. Having eaten at the buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (not all in the same day), probably the best 'bang for your buck' is the breakfast. Just remember to bring your Club card to save a couple of bucks (and use that for tipping based on good service).

It was our third stay at the hotel. The hotel is a considerable distance from the strip and any other casino. There are no outside restaurants within walking distance so I would not recommend the place unless you have a car. The rooms at SP are over sized. The property is only 5 years old and everything is still in very good condition. Each room comes with a large flat screen TV, a safe and a coffee maker. The bathrooms are large with an outside sink/dressing area from the shower/toilet room. Some reviewers noted a smokey smell on a no smoking floor. I did not have that experience other than one day when a person was walking down the hall smoking. As noted in other reviews, you must walk through the casino to get to the rooms. Parking is also a good distance from the rooms. If you have trouble getting around, this may not be a good choice for you. The place has several good restaurants. The buffet is only average. I would suggest the Mexican or Steakhouse. The cafe also serves great Chinese food. For quicker meals they have a deli that serves huge sandwiches (the pastrami is excellent) and a Steak and Shake burger place (always crowded). There seafood place was also always crowded with lots of people eating the chowder. I meant to try some but never did. The pool is fair sized but simple. They do have a large outside hot tub similar to the one at the Orleans (circular with a little island in the middle). You can get to the pool and the spa without walking through the casino. We do love the spa here. If you are staying, you can get a three day pass for only $45. I real bargain in my book. The spa has a sauna, steam room, waterfall massage, cooling pool and hot tub. The facility is clean and well equipped. Upon arrival they provide you with water sandals, and a locker. In the locker is a nice robe to wear in the facility. I did find it interesting that most of the younger men wore bathing suits while engaging in activities while most of the over 55 crowd went naked. I thought it would be the other way around. After you have relaxed you can go into the lounge area where they have fruit juice, coffee, etc. with a large screen TV and several over stuffed loungers. Very nice place to hang out and watch a game. I would highly recommend trying out the spa during your stay. We love to stay at SP because it has everything we need. It has a huge on-site bingo parlor, a bowling alley, a huge movie complex and an active poker room. The slot machines are pretty loose and they are very good with comps at they tables. I played BJ for about an hour and half on Christmas Eve and they comped our Christmas dinner at the cafe. I was betting $5-10 at a $5 table and actually came out ahead.

I looked it up using the TripAdvisor app for my Android phone. The price seemed competitive and the reviews were good. Overall, the hotel room was extremely clean and large. We had two queens and were easily able to accommodate our family of 5. I have just a few bigger complaints. For one, the bellman's service was very poor. It took us more than 30 minutes to have the bags brought from the car to the room. We came in late and were tired and it is difficult when the kids were so tired. Secondly, they were inconsistent in information. The woman at the desk told us that they would not put a cot in for one of our children but when we asked again from the room they did so. One reviewer mentioned the smoking and I agree that there was a lot of smoking between the front door and the elevators to the rooms. You HAVE To go through the casino to get to those elevators. Ideally, I guess it would be better not to have to subject the kids to that but no choice in this case. There is a buffett for morning breakfast but on weekends it's 15 dollars for the brunch. We got two 1/2-off coupons but there was no discount for kids, so it would have been a lot of money for breakfast. So we chose to have coffee and a pastry at the coffee place at the entrance to the hotel/casino. Overall, it was just an average experience. It seemed to me that if I had paid about $100.00 for the room I would have been more satisfied that I got my money's worth. If you have to be here, it's ok, seems safe, very clean place. But it's not a \"value\" and I wouldn't choose ahead of time to stay here as a place to save money for a trip or to get a \"Vegas experience\". Also, they are at least a 15 minute drive from the \"Strip\". Keep that in mind when you are planning your stay. Oh - one other thing.

I really liked the fact that South Point offered many decent restaurant choices at much lower prices than many of the strip properties. From check in to check out we experienced very friendly and helpful staff. The only negative was the valet staff and opertation. It was under staffed by very indifferent employees and was rather disorganized. It was the only area that we felt fell short of an upscale strip casino/hotel. The one bedroom suite was spotless and provided plenty of room for the two of us. Very nice bathroom with both a large soaking tub and beautiful granite shower. Casino had lots of choices of penny slots and lower minimum black jack tables. We are not big gamblers but enjoy spending a little time on the slots and found them to be a bit \"looser\" as with many of the casinos that are frequented by locals.

Not that size = quality for a hotel, but. This place felt more like an all around convention center/destination resort instead of a Vegas casino hotel. I've been up and down the strip and old downtown. South Point has a definite edge in class compared to many other places in Vegas. Check-in folks were very pleasant and accommodating. They said to come back down and they'd print off our boarding passes for our flights, and we did. The rooms were big and very nice. Even the bathroom was big, with two rooms. We were on the 7th floor. Someone said to book above 6 and you'll have a view, but we still had wall. The whole color scheme of the place is yellow, gold, bronze and red, in case it matters to you. The room was quiet, the bed was comfortable. South Point has a movie theatre, a bingo room and a 64 lane bowling alley on the second floor. We went bowling after my man did well on video poker! That's the time to walk away. :) The bowling alley was in great condition and we had fun. There were some locals bowling the next lane and they were friendly. The casino wasn't as loud or smoky as others, it was roomy too. There were plenty of bar and restaurant options, and upon check-in, they gave us some very useful coupons. We were there on a Sunday night, about the only night of the week they have no live show available, so that was a little bummer. We were only there one night. You walk down one long hallway to get to the rooms. The other long hallway leads to the equestrian center. I accidentally turned down that hallway once. Imagine my surprise that as I was walking by their open Coronado Cafe I was smelling horse manure. If you live on a horse farm, that might not bother you. But we decided not to eat at the Coronado Cafe based on that. Later we saw some spots of manure on the carpet coming from the equestrian center that someone had obviously stepped in and was tracking around. Generally, South Point was very clean. Service was fine. The whole buffet/club member thing was annoying. They advertised two prices for their buffet, one club member, one non. That would imply you don't have to be a club member to eat at the buffet, right? Wrong. At the register we were told we needed to go someplace else and get our club card before we could eat there. That took awhile, and I was not happy about being cornered into joining their club. I had no intention to gamble, so had no reason to join their club. Now I'm on another list, and spam from Vegas is likely in my future. I guess we'll see how much they spam me.

It is very convenient the movie complex inside the hotel. If staying in the core of the strip is a matter to you, this is not your hotel. It's far from the strip, but if have a car this is not a problem at all; the hotel is very close to the freeway and getting there is a matter of minutes. The only thing I didn't like is the mattress cover they use in the beds. I think is something to avoid wetness and stains, but it is very uncomfortably. For two nights I did not sleep very well until I found out what was disturbing me. So I recommend when you get here ask the maid to take it out. I hope someday they will offer free internet in the bedrooms but while they don't, there is free internet in the lobby (if you have your own computer). The spa facilities are very nice with sauna, steam, jacuzzi, a \"massaging\" water cascade and nice chairs were you can rest or take a nap (many hotel in vegas don't have a resting area where you can lie down). And a confortable lounge too. So, maybe you are not in the \"world of luxury\", but for sure you are going to be in a hotel that has everything with very reasonable prices.

Honestly we didn't plan to spend much time IN the room so we didn't upgrade. Plenty to do just at this hotel. Plenty of choices for food also from inexpensive up to fine dining. Loved having a Steak n' Shake in the casino. Ate there at least 4 times!! The Coronado Cafe had pretty good food for really cheap but you paid as much for a soda or cup of coffee as you did for most meals. I ordered a ham sandwich and a slice of cheese cake at the DelMar Deli (also in the casino). There was probably the better part of a pound of ham on the sandwich and the cheese cake was the best I'd had in a long time. This eatery was a little pricy compaired to Steak n' Shake but worth the money. I'm not too much of a gambler but I was able to spend quite a few hours at the $1 dollar roulette tables with out hurting my wallet too badly. Checked out the Indian National Finals Rodeo in the hotel's equestrian center. Pretty sweet setup. Caught a few frames of the Pro Bowler's tour at their bowling alley. Also a pretty sweet setup. Listened to an 80's band for a while at their in house club. Quality entertainment...sounded AWESOME! Didn't have time to hit the pool, movie theater or much else at this MONSTEROUS facility as we hit the strip pretty hard each day/night but there is enough to keep you busy for several days JUST at this hotel. Aside from, IMHO some really lousy and uncomfortable bed pillows, my ONLY real complaint was the distance from the strip. You either had to wait and pay to take a shuttle from the hotel, have a rental car or pay the rediculous Vegas cab fees... like $3 and something for the first 1/13th mile and a fair amount of change for each 1/13th mile after that. How the heck do you measure a 13th of a mile anyway?? It probably costs $5 bucks just to get out of the parking lot. I heard someone say it was twenty some dollars for a one way cab to the strip. Of the three transportation choices, it's probably cheapest AND most convienant to just get an inexpensive rental car. They do have a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel which is nice but I'll be getting a car at the airport next time. If you don't need Ceasar's Palace's luxury and you're looking for a good time, a great value for your $$$ and you don't mind NOT being able to just walk out of your hotel and be on the strip,... and you bring your own pillow...

Personally, since this is not exactly the type of hotel I would pick, my score is based on my personal preferences. I stayed at this hotel in November of 2011 as part of a convention. Pros 1. Really, large rooms and bathrooms. 2. Relatively new hotel (though by the look of it, this hotel needs to total renovation). 3. Great front desk staff (but the meeting sales staff left a lot to be desired). 4. Inexpensive room service (though the delivery time leaves a lot to be desired). 5. Off strip (if this is what you're looking for) 6. Equestrian Center (if this is a necessity for you) 7. Good meeting space (most on a single level) Cons: 1. This has to be the smokiest hotel I have ever been to in my entire LIFE. While most casino hotels allow smoking on the casino floor, the smell of the smoked traveled well beyond the casino space. My non-smoking room was on the 22nd floor and still, the smell of the smoke traveled through the vents into my room. My nose and throat were literally burning from the smoke. This issue alone will assure that I won't voluntarily stay at this hotel again. 2. While I am not a big TV watcher, this hotel has extremely, extremely limited TV options. The food at several of the restaurants I tried was lousy and not cheap. 3. Security. I am a seasoned traveler who does a great deal of traveling alone. For some reason, I was extremely unfcomrtable in regards to my safety at this hotel. While most Las Vegas casino properties have a million plain clothing and uniformed security officers patrolling the hotel non-stop, I didn't have the impression that this hotel had the same. One night, I got to the 22nd floor where my room was located and there was a rather grungy looking man asleep in a chair in the hall near my room. Three hours later, he was still there. Also, a lot of the hotels I have stayed in either have security near the elevators to whom you must show your room key or require use of the room key in the elevators to access the sleeping room floors. This hotel had a sign that one needed to show their room key to the security officer but there was no security officer in site over the 6 days I stayed at the hotel. 4. Bedding. All of the beds in this place have a plastic cover on them. In all of my travels, I have never encountered a matress with a plastic cover on it in a hotel room. It made sleeping uncomfortable, hot and noisy. The mattress it self was very uncomfortable in my upgraded room. I could feel the springs and so I didn't sleep very much over the 6 nights I was there. 5. Restaurants. This hotel leaves a lot to be desired in regards to restaurants. They have the standard Las Vegas Buffet, a couple of steak houses, and other sorts of restaurants (i.e. an Oyster Bar?!) but in terms of quick service take-out establishments, your options are Steak N Shake and an extremely overpriced coffee shop. Given that the area surrounding the hotel is somewhat desolate, this lack of options for a quick meal was very disappointing. 6. Service. The front desk staff was nice and attentive. The bell desk staff was a little snarky. The business center guy was great. My biggest issue was with the sales staff. There is a gentleman (who will remain anonymous) in the sales office who was a complete jerk and unhelpful. For the amount of money my event poured into this hotel (no less than $60,000), I would have expected a little more attention, kindness and willingness to cooperate. This is hands down one of the worst convention service staffs that I have ever worked with in my career. Overall, I will give this hotel an average rating.

First of all, this hotel is one of the smokiest 'newer' hotels I have ever been in. Not as bad as the El Cortez but it is certainly going down that path. If you have any sensitivities to smoke at all I recommend you do not step foot in this place. I stayed on the 16th floor and I could smell smoke all the way into my room. It burned my eyes and nose. The customer service is certainly lacking at best. Check in was efficient but the clerk was detached and bored looking - as was everyone else. The second night I returned home from work around 6 PM and wanted to turn on the TV. I'm by no means a big Television watcher but enjoy zoning out for 30 minutes or so by watching the news after a long, stressful day at work before I do some reading. Unfortunately, the television would not turn on. I called the front desk and was put on hold for about 3 minutes. When they finally answered the front desk agent was curt and said they would send an engineer up and immediately hung up the phone. Seriously? 30 minutes later no one had arrived and I wanted to go down to get some dinner but had to wait for the engineer. I called again, was put on hold for a few minutes again, and was told the same detached answer as before and was immediately hung up on. 45 minutes later... no one, 60 minutes later I finally call again and was finally listened to for more than 5 seconds. Well, 5 minutes later an engineer came up. He looked at the TV and went back downstairs to flip a breaker...This solved the problem but over 1.5 hours had passed. The food at several of the restaurants I tried was lousy and not cheap. Another thing is the people that this place tends to attract. They are some of the sloppiest, grossest looking people I have seen to date. I mean, is this pretty standard for las vegas? Shaved heads, tatoos, pants down to your knees, cigarette dangling out of their mouth. These people are unbelievable. I won't even make eye contact with anyone from this place.

We had a different hotel booked much closer to The Strip but it was much more expensive and we thought \"it's just one night and the reviews look pretty good, so we may as well save some money and stay at the South Point\". The reservation was prepaid with an online booking agency so getting a refund when were there wasn't possible. BIG MISTAKE! The first room assigned to us after a lengthy line-up at registration was on the 4th floor. When we opened the curtains we found a view of a cement wall - I guess the parking garage - approximately 30 feet away. We called down and were offered a \"view room\" for $10 additional, or a \"strip view room\" for $20 additional. We opted for the view room and waited 15 minutes for the bell boy to bring us our new keys and show us to our new room. The room we now had on the 21st floor did have a much nicer view facing the pool and riding ring. It still had the same shabby, dated look of the room on the 4th floor, but \"it's just one night\". We had a hard time seeing any qualities in our room that would merit a 4-star rating however with it's worn and filthy carpets and cheap linens. My husband left to go get our luggage while I waited up in our room. We have traveled extensively, staying in anything from 3 star to 5 star accommodations. But we have NEVER stayed in a hotel where it was abundantly obvious the bathroom had not been cleaned. There was feces in the toilet, which was completely disgusting. I called and asked for housekeeping to come and clean the bathroom ASAP and also asked for 3 extra pillows to be sent up. Ten minutes later, someone delivered 2 pillows and promised to come back with a third (he never did), but still no housekeeping. In the meantime, my husband had returned with all of our luggage and we wanted to put some things in the safe and leave, so we could take in some of the sights on The Strip. The safe door was closed and he was unable to open it. Another call was placed to have a maintenance man come and fix this. We waited 15 minutes and a maintenance man did come but he was unable to open the safe, telling us that someone would have to come and physically break the door off the safe. This would be another delay - at least 15 minutes for someone to come, and another 15-30 minutes to repair the door. We had electronics with us we did not want exposed to the rain (which they would be if they were carried in our backpack), so we decided to go downstairs and have our boarding passes printed while we were waiting. That took 20 minutes and when we returned to our room, the safe was still not repaired. We waited another 10 minutes and had just decided to take everything with us when there was a knock on the door, a different maintenance man this time. He rolled his eyes when we told him the first man had told us the door needed to be removed. He produced some sort of electronic device which had our safe door open and functioning within a couple of minutes. So, we locked up our electronics and left to spend 5 hours on the strip thinking all would be well when we returned. When we returned, it was obvious the toilet still had not been cleaned. My husband had flushed the feces away, but there were still urine marks on the rim. This time I called and spoke to a manager and told her all the things that had happened during our brief stay. She promised to get someone from housekeeping up right away, and offered us a $25 food credit and agreed to remove the $10 \"upgrade\" cost. The housekeeper came and cleaned our bathroom and finished around 10:30 p.m. We decided to order room service for breakfast to use our food credit. But, we could not fin a hotel information binder anywhere in the room. Yet another call brought us a binder 15 minutes later. We placed the order and finally got some sleep. Breakfast arrived perfectly punctually at 9 a.m. Unfortunately, all of the food was barely warm. We had order a $16 entree to share and added a cup of tea and a glass of orange juice. It turned out the tea was $5 and the OJ another $6 (for one glass). Add a mandatory $4 gratuity, a $2 service charge and tax and our bill became $34. Again disappointed but to worn out to complain again. We paid our bill and simply left, never to return again. Our mistake was choosing this hotel, thinking it could meet the needs of someone simply wanting a modern and clean well-appointed room. We're not gamblers or drinkers or equestrians, so our time in the hotel was actually spent in our room.

I found that the Hotel/Casino was VERY busy, and I asked about checking in early, which was around 11 a.m. I was told that my room was not ready, I had reserved a King with a Strip View, I was offered a 7th Floor 2 Queen room for which I declined. I then waited for about an hour, and contacted the Front Desk again, I was told my reserved room was still not ready, however they offered me a 2 Queen 18th Floor room (Room 1879). I accepted the room, and my stay began. I was there for 5 days 4 Nights (October 27-31), however on the night of the 29th (Saturday) a large party was held, which was called The Fetish and Fantasy Ball. This party started at 9:30 p.m. and went on til 4 a.m., yes you have that time correct. As I have already noted that I was on the 18th Floor, I could feel the bass from the music all the way into my room. I got very little sleep that night, and had some business to conduct on Sunday a.m. I was in the elevator with some other guests on my way out on the morning after, who were clearly upset about the noise (and on a higher floor than I), and I told them to let the Management know of their frustration. I also paid the Management a visit when I returned from my business that afternoon. I had a conversation with Venessa/Manager??, and informed her of my frustration with the noise issue, she was clearly concerned about the event in a way like I was telling her not to have it here, but I wanted her to know that paying guest who are calling this their place of residence was extremely important as well. I was given a rate reduction for that night, and offered a late checkout. I dont know how many guests were affected during this, but it's something that everyone who plans on staying here should know. As far as the other benefits for staying here, the Ticket book is nice, as well as the Buffet, and there are plenty of resturants to choose from, but some of those close kinda early, or at least for Vegas kinda early.

Although it is located on South Las Vegas Blvd. a ways off the beaten path of the most active part of the strip, the hotel makes it up in affordability, friendliness, cleanliness great assortment of restaurants, some of the largest guest rooms in Las Vegas and an outstanding pool and spa. I am involved in Professional Bull Riders (PBR) and visit the South Point many times each year on both cowboy business and other conferences. This hotel never disappoints. It has a true western/equestrian/bull riding feel, but if those are not your interests the hotel can still fulfill all of your needs. The Equestrian Center on the grounds of the hotel seats over 5,000 and has more then 2,000 stalls - all underground! The restaurants range from an upper end steak house right down to a Steak and Shake. It\u2019s pretty amazing that all the restaurants are fairly priced for a city where most food stops are pretty expensive. The buffet is one of the better ones in Las Vegas. The casino is large, spacious and has a nice clientele. The hotel is neither too big nor too small and has a very homey feeling.

There's something about walking down the hall and housekeepers asking you if you're enjoying your stay that appeals to me. My pet peeves when staying in a hotel are cleanliness and how fast housekeeping responds to requests for extra pillows or blankets. South Point gets an A+ in those categories. Pillows were brought to my room within 10 minutes of the phone call. I've stayed at the Belligio and love it there...it's probably my favorite hotel besides the Mandalay Bay. But I can't always stay there due to business per diems if I'm there on a weekend. South Point gets my third choice every time and I would actually pay double for what they charge per night. I recommended this place when my husband was there on business. He hemmed and hawed because he's spoiled by the Hyatts, Venetians and Hiltons. He came back raving, saying it was a great stay and he too, will be back to stay there. Don't be scared that it's slightly south of the Strip... you're a couple of exits away from the heart of the Strip off the I-15. It's maybe a 6-minute drive to the Strip. Easy on, easy off I-15 access, tons of parking and a hopping casino. Cocktail service in the casino is fairly good--if you're sitting at a slot machine, you won't get ignored like some other casino waitresses have a habit of doing. Another bonus point is their valet service. If you've been to Vegas and had valet parking, you know the deal. It's an excruciating long wait--I once waited 30 mins at the MGM. Not so at this hotel. I've never waited longer than 10 minutes, and that's probably because unlike the MGM, where cars are parked on multi-level structures adjacant to the casino, the cars at South Point are all in the lot (I assume). EXCELLENT valet service and you can call down from your room so that your car is waiting for you when you get to the car lobby. Also, unlike other Vegas Hotels, getting to the registration desk isn't a 15 minute walk (Hello, Mirage and Wynn Hotels?) It's right inside the lobby doors and getting to your room doesn't require a map and a compass to even find the elevators. The rooms are Eurpean boutique style and very large. Bathrooms are large. Flatscreen TVs and all the modern technology you need to conduct business. Don Vito's restaurant was very good and reasonable. The Big Sur Oyster Bar was FABULOUS. We sat at the bar and the chef action was fantastic. I would not recommend the Garden Buffet-- the food didn't look very fresh and many of the items listed on the buffet menu were not available. We also ate at the Coronado Cafe and the fare was typical high-end Vegas coffee shop but they had a pretty extensive Chinese Food menu and from what I could see, that was the speciality of the restaurant. I had a Ribeye steak special that was cooked to perfection for under 15 bucks (including potato, salad and bread).", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Worth", "Title": "\u201cViva Las Vegas - Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GailK1013", "ReviewID": "UR120014222", "Content": "Was just there in October.

They did that easily for us after a little sweet talking on my part. Once we arrived, we got a room with two queen beds facing east looking over the parking lot on the 21st floor. What I forgot to ask for was a king bed instead of two queens, so later when I did, they said they couldn't do it for a few days. After 3 days there, we transfered to a king bed room with a FANTASTIC view looking west over the pool.

I paid $65 a night (no so called \"resort fee\") for a large, clean modern room. Staff was helpful and polite, service was quick and efficient and the casino was bright and relatively smoke free. What more could you ask for at a Vegas hotel? Oh, I guess food and entertainment. Well there are a variety of restaurants from the inexpensive Steak and Shake hamburger joint to the expensive steak house. I liked the main floor layout. All of the restaurants are immediately accessed from the casino floor; no need to walk for miles like you have to in some strip expensive hotels. The buffet was cheap and although it cannot be compared to the more expensive buffets on the strip, it was certainly adequate. There is entertainment for the family with a multiple screen movie theatre and a bowling alley. The shows are directed at the more senior guests, with mainly stars from the 70s and some of them in their 70s. While I was there Tony Orlando (no Dawn) was the main attraction, next week it was Sha Na Na and the following week Juice Newton. A couple of weeks ago Connie Stevens was there. Wow, I haven't heard about her for 40 years! So I guess you can say entertainment wise, they had something for everyone. The casino was large with lots of slots and table games. They always had $5 double deck blackjack with good rules. You'll never see that on the strip! The swimming pool had some shade trees and looked nice. It is a ways from the strip and downtown so it might be best to have a car. So there you have it. I highly recommend it and will stay here in the future when I have to pay for a room (I'm usually comped for rooms).", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cA Great Value Hotel If You Know What You're Getting Into\u201d", "Author": "LasVegasResortFees", "ReviewID": "UR119527954", "Content": "We've visited South Point on numerous occasions.

The room we stayed in was roomy and spotless, great large flatscreen TV, ace king bed, superb bathroom and shower. Pool area is large with plenty of sun beds. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful, answering any and all questions we asked of them. All the restaurants we tried and especially the buffets were of a high standard and were very good value. The weekend brunch is a great deal. The casino is bright and light and not too smokey compared with some other off strip places we have stayed at. All gaming is good, plenty of interesting slots, video poker and table games to keep you gambling away. We hope to return to the Southpoint in the very near future and in the meantime can highly recommend it to anyone intending on visiting Las Vegas.

So that's all the hotel except the room. They also gave us a coupon book with free drinks, free buffet and free gift from the souvenir shop (these were all the free stuff) and lots of other free with purchase coupons like popcorn, desert etc that required a purchase. We used lots of our coupons plus we got comp'd buffet because we gambled a lot so we barely paid for food. Our breakfast was at the Seattle Best Coffee which is just like starbucks and its convenient to have inside the hotel (with regular pricing! for comparison the Starbucks at MGM properties, Monte Carlo and Luxor were I shopped are twice as expensive as LA for instance regular medium size coffee is $380 vs $1.95 here in LA) The service and people at the register (specifically Holly) were fantastic and very helpful. The people at the buffet (which is really inexpensive by the way with the player card). The SPA area is gorgeous, we didnt use it because we thought $25 is a bit high but next time we will get a service like manicure and use the SPA for free. SPA is $45/ 3 days. There is a couples area also that is separate admission than the regular SPA fee. Gym is $15/day. I think they will lower the cost to the SPA and Gym because none of us in our group used it and when we got a free tour of the place (to see what it looked like) it was empty. It has a nice lounge area for men to watch sports and read, very quite and relaxing to fall asleep in. I guess in the cold months where you cant use the pool its more popular. Now about the room and hallways. The elevator area is nice, the hallways are fresh looking with new carpet (the building is new, that's why) and the rooms are really nice and modern. Everything feels fresh and new. The beds are comfortable but the top sheet as someone else also pointed out feels like its un-breathable material so we just put it on the ground when we slept. Also we didn't know how to use the AC so we ended up having the AC on ON instead of Auto so the fan ran all night and I woke up with dried eyes and dry throat. Overall rooms are very nice and definitely fit the 4 star category in American standards (and 7 star in European standards). We just stayed at Monte Carlo and I think that was 3.5 Star but claimed 4 star. The bathroom is really nice, the shower is stone all the way up and the bathroom/shower being separate is a real convenience. The hotel is well insulated so you barely hear the other rooms, heck I couldn't even talk to my wife from the bathroom, she couldn't hear me. The only problem is the distance from the strip which didn't bother us because we had a car and it was about 10min ride and parking is free everywhere on the strip casinos anyway so one night we went to the strip and the other day we spent the whole day inside the hotel because there was enough to do inside.

I liked how you can put the pool chairs in the water; however, found several broken chairs so if you go to the pool, try to go early to get a good chair. One minor complaint about the pool is the lack of waitresses. Otherwise, it is fine for the family. One thing we loved about this hotel was that there were things to keep our kids busy. From the 24 hour bowling to the movie theatre, it was a nice experience for me since I don't usually gamble. The only thing that would make this the perfect place would be if the hotel invested in making carnival type games so that we wouldn't have to go to Circus Circus for that.

The location was ideal for us because it was right next door to The Grandview, away from the crowd and noise of the strip. We also discovered another close-by casino called The M Hotel & Casino. The deluxe room we booked was beautiful, clean, and romantic feeling. Best part, it was only $80. On previous trips, we used the movie theater (we saw one of the Resident Evil movies in XD -great sound and picture) and the spa (I Love the Spa!). My favorite thing about the spa was the \"hydro room,\" which has a sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, small swimming pool, and my favorite, the Cascading Waterfall -- just stick your sore shoulder under that super strong water pressure just before your deep tissue massage and you're all set. My husband has used the barber shop a couple of times for a haircut -- old school barbers, they even trim your eyebrows with a small comb and a small pair of scissors. So many choices for eating establishments, including an occasional hot-dog stand, which may have a looooong line, but for 75cent hot-dogs, can't beat it.

It's never crowded and has a steam room, dry sauna, whirlpool, a tepid pool and this high powered water tub that shoots a large volume of water onto your neck and shoulders. They have different scented themed showers with toiletries. I just wish I could get my husband to go to the co-ed section. It looks like fun. The buffett has great food and is pretty inexpensive. There's a large store inside that sells a good selection of wines, beers and liquor for as cheap as you're going to get. There's a really good steak house next to the italian restaurant.

It's so close to being a \"5\" that it makes you wonder why they don't go the last few yards to win. This is a quality operation: The large rooms, filled (but not overly so) with quality furniture, flat screen TVs, large bathrooms, and all the basic amenities (including wall safes, high-speed Internet/WiFi - but see below - and inroom coffee that tasted good) make it a pleasure to enter the room. A large bed, with quality double-sheeting, nice pillows and decorative drape was inviting, and even more so when extra pillows arrived within 10 minutes of a phone call. Housekeeping was excellent; this was on of the cleanest and best maintained hotel rooms I've ever seen. The rest of the hotel and casino are inviting, too: Three pools (one a massive, but attractive, hot tub and another for kids) were delightful, with a good snack bar, plenty of lounges to relax on, and friendly staff. The casino was nearly smoke free, and restaurants were excellent, particularly the Steakhouse, with one of the best filet mignons I can remember. Bowling and a 24-theater movie facilty (with open captioning for hearing impaired!!!) and a large equestrian center made this a good all-around family resort. Every member of the staff smiles, and is welcoming and helpful. That made it a friendly and warm place to be, something that is rare in Vegas. What's not to love? A few things that should be easily changed: First, the main pool either is filled with salt water or isn't treated; it tastes like the ocean, which is hundreds of miles away. That's a major problem, and one that should be quickly fixed. Another is the annoying fee ($13 a day) for internet service; while it's a disincentive to stay in your room and surf the 'net, instead of going downstairs to gamble - and help the place make money - it's also a serious irritant in this day of laptops, tablets and smartphones. Better they should modestly raise the very-reasonable room rate and provide WiFi at a free or nominal price. If you're not looking for hip clubs or resort shopping - both of which you can get to in 10 minutes with the hotel shuttle to the Strip - this place is almost perfect, and certainly perfectble.

Get 6th floor or higher and you'll be fine. The casino is VERY smoky. For whatever reason, this property has never figured out the secret to eliminating 98% of the smoke like upscale resorts such as Aria, the Wynn, etc. have done. I wanted to play some poker here because it is known for being frequented by very bad local players but I was highly offended by the poker room management so much so that I checked out of the property one day early. They have a very sourpuss attitude. The managers are from \"back east\" as we like to say which means that they are very gruff and think nothing of it. In my situation, the manager on duty allowed a very pretty younger woman to play ahead of me although my name clearly was at the top of the wait list (I had already waited 35 minutes). This was inexcusable and never would happen at Aria, the Wynn, etc. The poker room itself is pretty much deserted most of the time. There were only 3 tables playing at 4pm on a weekday afternoon. Who knows, maybe I'm not the only person they've offended? In any event, if you can get a higher level room for $50 or less, then it is a decent value. The resort fee is only $6 but doesn't get you much. They give you coupons you can use on the property including one free breakfast or lunch at the buffet, which is average, at best. But they do have a seafood bar that is pretty cool with awesome crab legs. The tex-mex restaurant upstairs was disappointing. The free margarita at dinner was the worst margarita I have had in my life, period. I could only take 2 sips then sent it back.

We had visited South Point on prior trips to Las Vegas and, after reading the other reviews on Trip Advisor, decided to spend a few nights here. We spent three nights here and two nights at the Golden Nugget which is reviewed separately. In short, our stay was wonderful. South Point is a clean, cheery and very friendly place with a good vibe. From check in to housekeeping, the staff was very friendly. It's considered a \"locals\" casino so the emphasis is on friendly service as opposed to the \"wow factor\" that you would find on the Strip. This can work especially well if you are more interested in great value instead of volcanoes, pirate ships and Venetian canals. Our room was on the 22nd (of 25) floor overlooking the mountains and a bit of the pool. At $20 extra, we didn't opt for a Strip view. The room was large, bright, and well decorated with newer furniture. The bathroom had a separate tub/toilet area. Bed & linens were above average and the flat screen TV was nice. Elevators were quick. The casino is huge, well lit and uncrowded. It is ringed with restaurants ranging from a deli & Steak and Shake to an upscale Steakhouse. On the 2nd floor you'll find a Bingo Hall, bowling alley & multiplex cinema. Certainly plenty to do here. In my opinion, the high points of South point are: a friendly place, clean, comfortable room, good water pressure in the shower (a must for any hotel), a surprisingly inexpensive gift shop (beer was available for less than it cost at home) The two drawbacks to staing here are the location (get a rental car) and the casino can get a bit smokey.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price.

Friday & Sat nights were like $60. Sounds like a fabulous deal in Vegas, but they said the Rio and I think Bally's are that cheap also. We exited door #9 from McCarran and grabbed the first Sedan driver (if they're standing outside their cars, they're available, and you don't have to pay for the wait time while you get luggage and such, which you would have to pay for if you reserved ahead of time). The chauffeur was very kind (spoke ENGLISH), and we paid a little extra to drive us near the strip for a few minutes before delivering us to South Point. Being Friday night, the Strip is basically a parking lot for several blocks, so he wound in and around and we got our first taste of Vegas. I was very pleased. Then we headed south for the 10-15 minute drive down Las Vegas Blvd to South Point, where there is nothing more to look at than an IHOP and outlet mall. We were instantly impressed with the size and glamour of the hotel itself. However, walking in, we hit a wall of smoky haze (again, Friday night) and had to detour around a rennovation area to find the front desk. I had called the week before with questions about the airport shuttle, daily shuttle to the Strip, etc., and my answer was \"they'll give you all that when you check in.\" They did not give us anything more than our room key. It wasn't a deal-breaker, but it would have been much more helpful if they had at least offered the schedules or a Las Vegas guidebook or something. The room was huge and clean and in great condition. (For those who have traveled with kids, I could have fit a playpen and 3 sleeping bags on the floor next to the King bed, and STILL had room to get to the bathroom in the middle of the night!) Each morning the shuttle to the Strip leaves every hour, more or less on the hour, and the drivers are friendly enough. Note: The shuttle is run by Ritz Transportation. They are a separate company, and you have to pay cash! Not truly a \"South Point\" shuttle! (This is not a review of Ritz, but if you stay at South Point and want to see the rest (or any) of Vegas, you need to know that.) The pool area is clean and gorgeous, though the smoothed-stone sidewalks get VERY hot, enough to burn feet. Beach towels are available just as you walk out, after you pass the doorman who checks for room keys before you go out. We only swam twice, and each time the water was chilly when we first got in, and took a minute to get used to. The pool is salt water, not chlorine, which also takes some getting used to. The main pool has a max depth of about 4.5 feet, plus there's a kid pool which is 2 feet or so. Then there's a large lagoon of a hot tub, which is an odd idea when it's always more than 90 degrees outside. Maybe it's more popular in the winter. We did not try the restaurants, though the Primarily Prime Rib was rated very highly here on TA and is inside the hotel itself. We DID go see a movie in the theater (HarryPotter 7.2) and it was clean, well-run, good sound, etc. Everything we expected of a modern movie theater. Better concessions than our local theater. The bowling alley is huge and not terribly smoky - big open space for it - and the snack stand just between the movie theater and bowling alley (beside the arcade) has YUMMY chicken strips. Just saying. Room service was spectacular, maid service was impeccable, but the bell desk was rude and NOT helpful. I'm not sure what their purpose is, but we got a lot more help from the valets and OTHER hotels' concierges. Don't call them for help, call the front desk. We watched several movies in the room (X-Men First Class, Midnight in Paris, and Thor) while they are still in theaters. They were digital movies, so you can rewind, pause, etc., or exit and save it til the morning! Movies are kept until noon the next day. So my husband finished watching X-Men after I fell asleep, but I finished it while he showered the next morning. I've never seen that before and it was fabulous. The technology, not just the movie. We did try the Garden Buffet and it was not spectacular, but we got full and it was a Vegas experience. The Round Table Buffet at Excalibur was MUCH better. Speaking of Excalibur - beware the body snatchers: very pleasant people in suits that approach and ask if you're in town for a couple days and offer to \"set you up with some free tickets.\" They offer show tickets and end up sending you to the Grandview (next door to South Point!) for a tour and Timeshare sales pitch. They said 2-3 hours but we were there for 4. Blech. Lie to them or just run the other way. I WILL say that we got $25 tickets to Tournament of Kings at Excalibur, which was awesome, as well as $150 in vouchers for dining at MGM, Luxor and Excalibur.

The prices are more reasonable than the other Vegas hotels where we've stayed. We haven't eaten at all the restaurants at the hotel but the Cafe is good and food at the oyster bar is tasty. The buffet is just so-so (but at least it isn't overpriced!). We've always liked the bars and the barstaff.

Full movie theatre and bowling alley. Also large arena with events many free to watch. Cutting Horse event while we were there that was really interesting to watch. Seems to have lots of locals and is very busy in the weekends. Lots of familes with kids due I'm sure to the great pool area and bowling and theatre. Lots of outdoor parking and easy to access. We gambled on the strip and never did very well. Sister plays the slots and was winning all the time at Southpoint. Seems like others as well. Good point system with players card. Staff and food all really good. Ate at the buffet , deli and burger & shake cafe all very good and reasonably priced. Before 12:00 each day you can get a bloody mary, mimosa for $1.00 or baileys coffe for $2.00. You don't really have to rent a car if you stay here as they have a good shuttle service to and from the airport. A daily shuttle goes on the hour to the strip and has 3 stops, Excalibur, City Centre or Treasure Island. It costs $8.00 per day for as many times as you want to use it.

I have to commend South Point for accommodating so many people. There must've been 2500 racers and their families. I ate at 3 of their restaurants during my stay and my fav was a little Asian place in the Casino area, I forget the name..Oyster Bar maybe, but order the Grilled Lobster and Cheese sandwich! This was good and there was no waiting. The arena where they built an indoor MX track was amazing..and air conditioned. Bell service and Valet were on it too. The room was not so great. There was an unpleasant odor in our room and no exhaust fan in the bathroom. After a good shower, the room felt like a sauna. On a good note, we had closed circuit TV in our room to keep track of the 3 days of BMX racing in the Arena. This way we didn't have to sit at the arena on standby for 12 hours waiting for our turn to race. A real plus when you have 2 kids, wife and your father in law with you, and two of them secretly just want to escape to the casino for some gambling. Speaking of gambling, I played a penny machine for 3 hours on the same 20 bucks and won enough at Racebook, betting Ryan Newman (Sprint Cup Race) to cover our trip. I also have to say that I was amazed that when we went bowling at midnite at South Point's allnite bowling alley, the place was packed. I guess nobody sleeps in Vegas. Or maybe because its 110 degrees during the day, they only come out at night. My kids loved it. They loved the arcade, the bowling alley, and they seemed preoccupied with the gift shop too.

I usually coordinate my own groups, but the rates to stay on site where the bowling center was situated was just too good to pass up. First the positives: Coming from LA, this is the first major hotel on the 15. You're not even close to the \"strip\" but it's only a few minutes up the freeway to get there. You'll be near the South Las Vegas Outlet Mall, and fast food places, gas stations, etc, without the Strip traffic. Rooms are huge. Two queen beds, a working desk, a table and chairs, closets with doors, and a great private bathroom set up. Hot water and great pressure at all hours of the day and night. We were on the Strip side, on the 21st floor, so we had views of planes taking off and landing. The beds were amazingly comfortable and our room was as frigid as we needed it to be the entire weekend. The onsite Seattle's Best had some of the friendliest baristas I've seen. When one found out we were bringing cocoas back up to a couple of our little bowlers, he sent up a few extra chocolate sticks with the drinks. The Del Mar deli was a great option for breakfast sandwiches. A little disappointed with the buffet--both the short breakfast hours and the Saturday \"brunch\" had us eating away from the hotel more than we wanted to. The kids were introduced to Steak and Shake--the closest one we've seen outside the Midwest. It's got great hours, and it's got a line at all hours, but order \"to go\" and you'll have a great experience. Primarily Prime Rib had chicken (I'm not a red meat eater) and Turkey Chili and Manhattan Clam Chowder--and all were fantastic. The downside--allow a 15-minute walk from the rooms to the parking garage. This is a real pain when bringing luggage to and fro, or if you forget something from the car. We opted for the parking garage to shield the car from the heat, but the other parking lots were no closer. The hotel was packed with a basketball tournament, so the elevators were full, and the pool area was way too crowded. But there is an in-house bowling center, a movie theatre and an arcade for the kids. $1 bowling after midnite Monday through Thursday.

Thereafter, I found the room to be large, with an extra sofa, the tv to be modern, and the water very hot. The dealers made playing a pleasure, and all of the food was good, especially the fine dining at Michaels (incredibly expensive if you are not a high roller being comped). I was at a meeting with over 1,650 attendees, and I was impressed with how well the food and beverage department handled our breakfast buffets, and particularly our lunch breaks. At checkout, I did have a concern about my room charges that neither the desk clerk or her supervisor were willing to correct, but a brief email to the manager (who was not yet in for the day) was answered promptly that afternoon and the matter was resolved completely to my satisfaction.

Wow! We took advantage of a reduced room rate of $42/night - yes, you read that correctly! We had a large, clean room on the 24th floor with 2 queen beds and a view of the pool. The bathroom is also large with a separate room for the toilet and shower. Dedicated elevators for this tower (floors 15-25) made it a quick ride up from the Casino level. The casino floor has high ceilings and is bright - really a feeling of natural light illuminating everything. The air was clean and smelled fresh - no clouds of cigarette smoke hovering over the tables. Check-in was quick and the reservation clerk was very friendly and helpful, giving us an overview of the hotel in general as well as restaurant recommendations. In fact, this was the friendliest and most user-friendly hotel we have encountered in Vegas. Every employee we encountered had a smile on their face and was quick to ask if we needed anything. There are several restaurants on the premise ranging from a walk-through deli with fabulous take-away desserts, a coffee bar with lightning speed service, 2 steak houses, a Mexican restaurant, Italian Restaurant, a buffet with expansive breakfast choices, a cafe, and a 5-star restaurant offering Continental Cuisine. There is absolutely something for everyone in your group, from children to adults. We ate at the Italian restaurant one evening and received helpful tips on wine and entrees from our servers. Due to an evening engagement, the waiter also asked the kitchen to expedite our food orders. Valet service (we had a car) was also quick, efficient and friendly. Though we didn't use the pool, we could see it from our room. It was lovely - very large and appeared fun for kids through adults. This is a great hotel for singles, couples, and families.

They have a good mix of restaurants, a good pool, a good gym and excellent friendly service. You are away from the \"buzz\" and that is why you select this resort. If you have a need for the strip, take a cab or the shutlle. The overall rating for this hotel is excellent for us. The location may, for some, not be as suitable which is the location rating chosen. We have no issue with the location ourselves. If I look to find something negative, I am hard pressed to find anything to comment on. This casino is for the couple / family that wants to relax while being able to enjoy the amenities (theaters, bowling, gym, casino) all at an affordable price. We were very impressed with the restaurants we used. We found the cleanliness standards to be more than acceptable and always leave a gratuity for the women who attend to the care of our rooms.

We thought that was great! We missed the shuttle from the airport so we decided to take a taxi, that was about $30, so not terrible. The check in was nice and painless, they already had everything very much set and gave me a free room upgrade. We thought that was really nice, specially after paying what we paid for the original room. The room was nice and clean, with freshly made bed, really clean and tidy bathroom, which was nice and big. It had a nice couch and flat screen TV. The entrance from the moment you go into the casino until you get to the elevators to take you to the rooms was quite smoky. It didn't bother me as much as it did my wife, she really couldn't stand it. I don't blame the casino as much as the people there. I guess it's big with locals to go and play there being that it's off the strip and rather cheap playing tables. So you get more of a local crowd. They had $5 blackjack tables which was nice. the dealers weren't very friendly and more serious than the other casinos we visited. It is a little further from the strip than I thought it be. So after the first day of taking a taxi, due to missing the shuttle when we were ready to go, costing us about $30 each way. We asked the concierge regarding renting a car and they have some hook up with a local car rental that is actually at the airport, so it worked out great. It was relativity cheap, $30 a day, and with free valet parking in all the major Hotels. It was a deal, room for 5 days with car rental $435.

Pros: - Very clean property (rooms, restaurants, casino) that appeared to be relatively new and was well kept, though by no means attempting to be a luxury property. - Staff was friendly and helpful. We arrived early in the day and had no problem checking into room early. - Inexpensive rooms/ restaurants and low (mostly $5) casino table minimums - Free airport shuttle Potential cons - Location is far off strip. In fairness, I'm sure this is how they keep the prices down. The hotel has a lot of choices for food and entertainment besides gambling so if you had a car or didn't mind staying put, this isn't an issue. - There were a lot of families with children here which could be a pro or con depending on what you're looking for. They have movie theater, bowling and nice pools that kids could use so if you're looking for place where you could turn teenagers loose to entertain themselves this appeared to be a good place. - Only complaint I have (and it is nitpicky) is the lack of feather pillows in the rooms. The ones that were there were very hard and overstuffed. - While lots of choices for food, we ate at the buffet and couple of the restaurants and found the food good, but not great (think Denny's).", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento", "Title": "\u201cGreat priced Hotel\u201d", "Author": "vivnoaln", "ReviewID": "UR111146089", "Content": "We had a lovely stay at this hotel.

The hotel and casino still looks brand new and spotless. Being away from the Strip, I felt safer since we left our spouses at home. Checked in with Chelsea and what a pleasure! She smiled, laughed easily and listened to my requests then worked to locate the room, floor and even suggested the pool view which my niece loved. Due to severe allergies, bedding was a concern but Chelsea 's hotel knowledge enabled her to give me correct information without a delay. I checked in a day early and didn't want to eat by myself in a restaurant so I ordered \"TO GO\" at the new Steak and Shake. Without a digital number display, we all had to listen for our order numbers to be yelled (no microphone) but as the restaurant filled it was impossible to hear. We had to keep checking on numbers and clustering around the cashier. The hamburger was delicious, I enjoyed it in my beautiful, quiet room. The A/C wasn't cool but within 30 minutes after calling housekeeping the filter was replaced and the room cooled down. The next morning I had some time to kill before picking up my sister and niece at the airport but I couldn't find the penny slot machines. I asked a guard near the cashier's cage and he took me to some slots and explained how to change the coin play amount. Wow! I had no idea! Maria from Housekeeping kept our large room immaculate and had no problem with our request to change the linen daily (they prefer every 3rd day) and leave us plenty of towels. I love the luxury of clean linen and towels each day in a hotel. The towels were big and fluffy but we didn't use any of the toiletries due to allergies. I don't remember the coffee pot in 2007 but it was very convenient. The bathroom is large and the early morning I returned home, I rolled my suitcase into the bathroom to finish packing so I wouldn't wake my sister or niece. We ate breakfast in the Coronado Cafe each morning. The wait staff and their assistants anticipated our needs so we never had to ask for any refills or condiments. Do avoid the early morning counter service if possible. You won't save any time and service is not good. We invited some friends over for a delicious lunch in the Garden Buffet. We were able to use our complimentary coupons and only paid for our guests. I loved the Chinese and my niece enjoyed the Mexican food. After returning from dinner we played the 9:30pm Bingo. The second night we each rented the electronic units, so much easier. The complimentary beverages at the bar was a nice touch. My sister and niece enjoyed a wonderful and relaxing massage in the Spa on their last day. The warm oil they rubbed on did wonders to their dry skin and for the first time in a week, they felt like they had some moisture in their skin. They were pleased they weren't pressured to purchase any spa products.

First of all, yes, I did notice the smoke when I got into the Southpoint, but I have low grade asthma and have been prone to getting sinus infections if I am around too much smoke. Neither issue cropped up and we spent a lot of time in the casino. You get that in Vegas since they have smoking. I dealt with it. The rooms at the Southpoint are larger than some of the other mid level price hotels that I have stayed at in Vegas (Harrah's, Ballys, Flamingo, etc). The beds were comfortable and the pillows on my bed were actually better than a lot of hotels. The bathroom was very clean and spacious as well. The gambling was good. You can always find a $5 table game, be it blackjack, roulette, craps, etc. I like the higher ceilings in the place and did not mind that color scheme. Now, the dining was another thing entirely. Our first night we hit Don Vito's and had the Seafood Diavolo which was excellent. Probably the best shellfish meal that I have had in twenty years. The stuffed mushrooms were very good, the grilled shrimp appetizer was fine and too much food. Dessert was a piece of chocolate cake, which was very good. Two drinks each and the bill was only $86 before tip. Sat night we ate at Baja Miguel's which was decent. I cannot say it was off the charts, but serviceable. They were nice enough to throw fajita chicken in a chimichanga instead of the shredded chicken on the menu. Chips, salsa, and guac were complimentary with dinner as well. Our last night, we ate at the Steakhouse and had surf and turf and the lump crab appetizer. Let me say that the amount of lump crab in that cocktail glass would make any other restaurant look cheap on their volume of crab. I could never find the bottom of the glass, but did. I will not waste shellfish. The ribeye steaks were great, no need to say more. You get a potato and a large, I mean large salad with your meal. The lobster was not needed and not very sweet, but heck, I never order surf and turf. I am going back with my wife and friends at the end of the month and Don Vito's will definitely be a dinner choice one of our nights in Las Vegas. Golf, we played at Paiute, the wolf course. I have not played at Paiute in about ten years. It is a very nice track and we got an early afternoon tee time for $50 on golf now. You can't beat the layout and the overall course conditions for that price. On Sunday we went down to play the Primm desert course. A nice track and complex just into California. Paid $49 for that round. If I had to choose, Paiute is the place to play between the two. I would recommend the Southpoint all in all, and you can get a comp. My friend and I played a lot and we just asked and the staff was gracious to give us a dinner comp. At Bill Salon and Gambling Hall (the old Barbary Coast), we played on a crap table for over almost four hours, my friend, at times had over five hundred bucks on the table and we barely got credit for anything. But, they are owned by the Harrah and the big guys don't comp diddly.

I've been to all the big casinos on the Strip and have never had that problem before. Perhaps it is that the ventilation system is not as good, but it was by far the smokiest casino I've ever been to, with the exception of those found on cruise ships.

We were in LV 5/6 - 5/10, and spent the first 3 nights in a casino, center strip, with the last night at SP. We've been to LV several times over the course of 5 years - stayed on the strip and off the strip in a variety of hotels and condos. This time, we went to LV for the Supercross finals, so the men wanted to stay on the strip. DH and I stayed an extra day for a little R&R on our own and decided to give South Point a try. Checkin: We checked out of our strip casino at 11:00 and headed straight to SP via taxi. We arrived at approximately 11:30am and headed to the check in desk hoping we would be able to check in. We were greeted by a very friendly young lady who promptly checked us in. After some friendly chit chat about the difference between on and off strip properties we were handed our keys to our room. She asked if we knew how to get to the elevators, we did not, so she gave us quick directions and we were off. Room: We stayed in Room 1027. A beautiful room, large in size. Our view was of the roof of another building, but we still had a somewhat mountainous view. The room was very clean, we couldn't find anything wrong with it from that perspective. The bed was comfortable...we managed an afternoon nap and a great nights sleep. Amenities: The pool was very nice and clean. I worry about whether or not there would be enough chairs if the hotel was booked to capacity. We used the bowling alley and the movie theater. Bowling alley was a fun addition - bowled three games and had a really good time. We also enjoyed snacks from the conession stand at the movie theater and found the theater itself to be very clean and good in size. Movies were current and plenty of show times. The spa area and the work out facilites were also immaculate. It was very frustrating the cost of everything at the hotel. The cost to use the spa and the fitness center was several dollars more than what I paid on the strip. There was also no discount to hotel guests for bowling or the movie theater. (Though we did have a coupon for free bowling - for every game we bought we got another free.) I feel as a hotel guest, there should be some sort of discount for using those facilities. Casino: The variety of slot machines was great - very comparable to machines on the strip and better selection than our strip hotel the first few days. However, table games were a let down. There was not a lot of variety in table games, neither of my two favorites were available. However, there was a good variety in minimum bet - a welcome change from staying on the strip. Even at its busiest, the casino still offered $5.00 minimums at certain tables. Food: Staying only one day left little opportunity for trying all of the restaurants, but we did have the buffet for lunch. There was a lot of variety on the buffet - but the food itself wasn't very good. Though we didn't use it - they offered both strip and airport shuttles. The price on the strip shuttle was very reasonable. We had a very early flight out, so we were unable to use the airport shuttle as the first departure was at 6am. If you want a lot of action, noise and chaos - this is not the place for you. However, it's a great way to add a few extra days to the end or beginning of a trip.

Obviously tired of dealing with the public. We requested a refrigerator and he asked if it was for medications and I said yes, he kind of rolled his eyes. The fridge had not shown up by 10:00 so I called the front desk and they told me that there had not been one ordered. They sent one up pretty promptly after that. The room itself was not so clean. There was some kind of Pink and Blue crap on the ceiling and a few globs on the wall and even a goober looking thing on one of the bed drapes. It looked like some party remnants from a shower of sorts. Beds were ok but the mattress protectors did not fit well and kept wadding up underneath the sheets making it feeling lumpy.

If you watch the sales, the rates cannot be beat ($35 to $60). The rooms are very spacious and always decently clean. With the addition of the new tower there are over 1200 rooms. It\u2019s a massive property that clearly operates on a volume based principle. They have a bowling alley, arcade, movie theater, equestrian/rodeo center, and about a half dozen very boring restaurants. The spa is nice, but caters mostly to locals, which negates any \u201cresort\u201d experience in my opinion. But the prices, again, cannot be beat! The service is nothing special. In fact, most employees have that \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to work today\u201d vibe. They remind me of Walmart employees \u2013 Unhappy but need a job\u2026 any job. Don\u2019t hold your breath for any of the usual pleasantries unless they\u2019re expecting a tip. But honestly, when you account for the kind of people they have to deal with, I really can\u2019t blame them\u2026 This is not a place for hipsters. There are business travelers like myself, who are just there for a decent and cheap bed. Then there are the families with out of control screaming kids\u2026and cranky sloooooow old people\u2026and plenty ( and I do mean plenty) of hillbillies. Now if you\u2019re the sort with a groovy pair of cowboy boots, a truly disturbing pair of daisy dukes, four kids by four different fathers, an alcoholic mother and gambling addicted stepfather \u2013 then this is your scene! Otherwise, drive up to the Town Square just past the 215 for any dinning/shopping/socializing. Oh, and DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU HAVE A CAR! Also, because the valet service is so slow, I suggest parking in the self parking garage first, walking down to registration, then back to your car for your luggage, and then to your room. This will save you from hauling your stuff all over the busy casino maze and/or waiting endlessly for your luggage/car. And yes, this is one of the smokiest casinos in all of Vegas. It\u2019s so bad that you can taste it in the food! But I\u2019m a sensitive non-smoker\u2026 The pool is right next to the freeway and gets lots of dust clouds flying over. Plus there are way too many kids running around for it to be relaxing. Overall, South Point is a pretty good hotel. I will certainly stay here again.

On Saturday and Sunday, they only have brunch and you can't use the vouchers for that meal (only specifically breakfast, lunch, and dinner so brunch was not included. I called to verify and found that is the policy). So effectively, you can only use them for dinner on Friday or Saturday night. I'm not ever sure if you can use if for Friday night since that is the seafood night and the price is higher.

Chose South Point due to positive reviews. It was indeed a very large, inexpensive, surprisingly classy room in the \"mid-price, no view\" category, working out to about $45 a night--I got lucky and happened to book during a shoulder week: Prices were higher the weeks before and after. Cleanliness: Overall the hotel felt and looked clean--the lobby floor is picked up, the elevator area is pleasant and shiny, the pool area isn't a towel dump, and the corridor carpets are in good repair. Of course there is the inescapable smoke of the casino--which is everywhere in Las Vegas, and took me by surprise, coming as we do from the Nanny State next door. The casino ventilation in South Point is better than some, but not as good as others, such as Caesar's Palace--but one might say, Caesar's Palace had better be the best. A final note: I wish they kept the glass entry doors cleaner. Service The reason I put a three is because when I requested more hangers, it took a full day, and then what I received was a tangle of wire hangers, not the nice wooden ones. Our housekeeper was solemn and didn't greet us in the hallway. I'm silly that way: I like to be greeted by the housekeeping staff. I just put it down to personal unhappiness. She did a nice job with the room, no complaints there, and I gave her $10 as a show of goodwill when I left. Lastly, the guy who checked us in was helpful, but seemed like an old con on work release rather than the bright agent of welcome I tend to prefer. My question: \"Can you find us a very quiet room?\" seemed to arouse suspicion in him and he eyed me unpleasantly, looking for motive. But I did get a \"very quiet room\" at the end of the hall on the 11th floor. Location This I loved, four miles south of the Strip. You can take the resort's daily $8 RT shuttle bus or drive yourself. I drove into the Strip each day and self-parked at one of the big hotels. I was relieved to be far, far away from the churning bodies, shouts, and neon of the Strip, troglodytes snapping prostitute calling cards at every corner, all of which took on the feel of an undulating nightmare animal by the end of our third day. Remember, we're laid-back mom-and-son San Diegans. (Then why choose Las Vegas? you may ask. Believe it or not, it was because the weather report said the Grand Canyon would be \"rained out\" and I had never been to Vegas. \"I thought it would be fun.\") Value I guess when you take the low price of the room, and add a $5.95 breakfast buffet each day, a cheap lunch somewhere, etc., it's good value. I had an idea that Vegas was a great value for everyone. The lesson I learned is that it's not, at least for sober, retiring people: You have to be a Vegas guy. The value is when you drink and smoke and gamble and get comped for shows and meals and earn points with your little frequent-guest card in the video slots. That is, when you like to do Vegas stuff. I'm not him (or her). I'm a mom who wanted a thrifty escape for her boy, and by the time it was over I wished we were in a small, decent room in a Hampton Inn somewhere, with a nice smoke-free lobby, free coffee in the lobby, a complimentary breakfast buffet, even at $40 more per day for the room. Room / Sleep Quality For such a well-appointed room--handsome drapes, lovely linens, firm mattress--there was no mini-fridge or microwave, and the channel selection was meager. But it is a 42\" wall-mounted TV, and nice to watch an in-room movie on for $12. I saw a teeny mini-fridge being removed from another guest room, so I guess it can be requested. Maybe this is typical in Las Vegas, or typical in general for resort rooms (to drive the guests into the establishment for their food and relaxation?) but a small disappointment for someone who likes to put a little food and milk aside and channel surf with her kid while on vacation. Overall Impression Traveling with a child, I did very much appreciate the brightness, even cheeriness of the South Point casino floor: When we walked through some of the dark casinos of the Strip to get to parking, I felt like a bat might suddenly fly at me screaming, and I sensed evil everywhere. The bottom line is: If you're savvy about Las Vegas, know your way around, and know how to work the system, South Point is a very good choice for families with children. Large, clean, comfortable rooms, good thermostat, nice pool and Jacuzzi, bowling lanes and movie theater. But poor channel selection and nowhere to put leftovers.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cWorst Customer Service ever\u201d", "Author": "pesker", "ReviewID": "UR103086056", "Content": "I traveled to Las Vegas during one of the busiest weekends of the month so in order to save money we decided to stay at South Point instead of on the strip.

They called down security and he was the only friendly person we talked to that night.

He said he reviewed the surveillance tapes and our window was half down when we arrive (this is false and the part where he was basically calling us liars). At this point we decided to file a claim. The head security took our information inside to photocopy and when he came back, his attitude had completely changed.

After an hour of standing in the cold, we went in to speak with the front desk manager to ask for a ride to dinner. Before I could even talk she said \"we don't know what happened so we can't be shuttling you guys around everywhere.\" umm, ok? Also, she said she is not authorized to make that decision and there was no one in the hotel that could. On St. Patricks day and the beginning of March madness, there is no one managing the hotel.

We arrived at SP around noon Sunday. The lady at the front desk said that it wasn't a problem checking in early as rooms were already available. When I arrived to my room everything was 100% clean and spotless. The bathrooms looked stellar and the bedding area was in order. No discrepancies whatsoever. Every room at SP is equipped with a 42\" plasma television. After showering and eating a nice meal at their buffet, we played some games on the casino floor and actually won some money. We than took a shuttle that transported us from the property to the Las Vegas strip at an affordable 24 hour rate. The shuttle service to and from the strip is what really made this stay a positive one as cab fares in the Las Vegas region can be ridiculously expensive. Yes, SP is located a good five miles from the L.V. strip, but the generous shuttle service rate which is good for 24 hours compensates the distance between SP and the strip. We enjoyed the numerous services that SP had to offer while on property. SP is one of those hotels that I consider a hidden gem due to its location off the strip. Personally, I would avoid booking a stay on any on strip properties as the majority of them are over hyped while incurring hidden fees. At SP, there are no hidden fees. Overall, SP is the way to go if you're on a budget but still want to experience the treatment of a luxurious five star mega resort that is found on the L.V. strip. The difference between a privately owned hotel compare to a corporation run property is amazing. Avoid corporate hotels which are found mostly on the strip.

It is large and there are always tons of people on the floor. The sports book area is also very cool and is very dynamic during big sporting events. Security at the casino is tight though and it is somewhat of a tense environment and it feels like somebody is always looking over your shoulder. Parking at this hotel is a bit of a pain.

But I am gonna tell you now, if you have to take a taxi (35 bucks and up) to get to the strip, or use their shuttle ($8 per person & time consuming), do yourself a favor. STOP reading reviews of this place and just find somewhere else to stay. South Point's remote location from the strip should be a deal killer if you don't have a car, and I wouldn't dare stay there if I didn't have my own transportation. Trust me on this. If you can afford to pay that kind of money for a taxi, you can afford to stay on the strip in a higher dollar hotel. If you are still with me, here we go. Spent 6 nights (Sun-Fri) while in town for a conference at the LV Convention Center. I didn't have a choice on hotels because my colleague blindly picked SP based on the cheap room price, so we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. We had a company car, so we weren't horribly worried about transportation issues. I booked my room about a week in advance direct by phone at the hotel. The girl who I dealt with must have been new, because she put me on hold several times to get answers to some relatively simple questions. But overall, she booked me a room and it wasn't too painful. They charge a one day deposit up front to hold the room. Once you arrive, they tack on a hundred dollar incidental charge to your credit card, which they say is returned. I have not yet confirmed this, as I haven't got my CC bill at the time of this review. My six day stay wound up averaging about $58 a night, and the total bill (no incidentals) came out to be about $385-ish after taxes. Not bad at all. Check in was pretty easy and non eventful. You have two choices for parking. One, on the ground level parking lot outside the east or north sides of the hotel, or in the 7 floor large parking garage on the northwest side. They are more or less about the same distance walk to the rooms, which I would say is not horribly long. Certainly less than some of the major strip hotels. Plan on a 5-10 minute walk to your car from your room. You have to pass through the casino area no matter how you come in to get to your room. I hate this, but that seems to be the norm in most of the big outfits. We chose to park in the parking garage on the top floor, as we could see our car from our rooms on the 20th floor. The garage was plenty big, and was empty enough where we always got a good parking spot. That was not the case with the ground floor parking, which was largely full most of the time. Also, coming in from the garage bypasses all the crazy traffic jammed up activity at the main entrance (taxis, bell hops, valet, etc.). Using the parking garage is much less dramatic coming and going versus using the main entrance, which can be a madhouse at times. I attached 5 photos of my room, which was a \"Deluxe King Non Smoking\", the cheapest room in the hotel. You will see it is clean, modern enough, and spacious. Zero complaints about the room, other than they don't have refrigerators, which sucks, and they charge 13 bucks a day for internet, which likely would have been a deal killer for me, but again, I didn't have a choice. I think the girl told me I could have a refrigerator for an extra 15 bucks a day, but that was gouging in my opinion. Even Super 8's have refrigerators and microwaves these days, so this is pathetic. There is certainly ample room in the rooms for them. I brought a small cooler and just put ice in it every day. They do have an ice machine near the elevators. Fortunately, the prices of food at SP are low (I will go into that in a minute), so it wasn't too major of an inconvenience. I understand these hotels charge for internet access because they don't want you in your rooms surfing the net.....they want you in the casinos. But just about everyone needs to check their email once or twice a day, and the internet charge is ridiculous. They supposedly have free wi-fi in the lobby by the check in desk. I did see a couple of people with laptops in this very small area, which is surrounded by casino areas. I fortunately borrowed an air card for my laptop, so I didn't need to try to utilize the lobby wi-fi. But again, I would likely not stay there based on the lack of free wi-fi alone if it was up to me. The rooms had their own climate controls, which was great. They had a good quality collection of soap/shampoos, and a single cup coffee maker. There is a Seattle's Best coffee shop at the main entrance, and surprisingly, their prices are not higher than a regular coffee shop. Their \"normal\" prices were a pleasant surprise. I would not have been pleased about the single cup coffee maker if the coffee shop prices were high, but this made it more tolerable. The furniture/TV/accessories in the rooms were of good quality. The large flat screen TV had a minimal lineup of channels. Again, I'm sure they don't want you in your room watching TV all day. I get this, but don't like it. The bed was comfortable, but a tad bit firm. Not too bad though. The pillows were comfortable. The maids consistently did a good job cleaning my room each day. Hint: lock your room with the bar across the door each morning, or put out a \"Do not disturb\" sign outside the door if you don't get up early. If not, the maids do a \"room check\" fairly early and knock and enter. They don't wait for you to answer the door, they knock and immediately enter. I am not sure what this room check accomplishes, as it's not when they actually clean the room. The only thing it accomplished with me was to wake me up a couple of times. A minor negative was the bathroom lighting was inadequate for shaving. The bathroom sink area should be better lit. The shower was excellent. A large head and seemingly clean. We didn't really take advantage of any of the recreational opportunities other than the casino, but we did take a look at the bingo hall and bowling alley. They both looked cool if you are into that. We never checked out the equestrian center, as it didn't have anything going on at the time we were there. The casinos seem to be more or less clean, and with a fair choice of games. I am not much of a gambler though, so I am not well versed in this area. I did wind up leaving about 25 bucks ahead, which is probably just lucky. As far as smoke is concerned, I would say overall it wasn't too bad. At times if you are in a spot where a bunch of people are smoking, you're gonna be smoky, but overall, I don't think it was as bad as I have experienced in other casinos. The waitresses were decent on bringing drinks most of the time. There were a couple who seemed to be a tad bit slow, but it wasn't so bad that it made me mad. There was a pretty good security presence in the hotel. They seemed to have a lot of guards and they made their rounds enough to where you felt like they had a good grip on things. There were also plenty of slot attendants moving about. I felt the security presence overall was above average. Most nights, the security makes you show your room key at the elevators, presumably to prevent large parties from going on in the rooms. I appreciated this. No need to have riff raff or thieves moving about freely on the upper floors as well. Another issue that was a HUGE plus in my mind was it seemed the prices overall for a lot of things at SP were cheaper than what you would pay at strip hotels. For example, the Steak and Shake diner had cheap prices. A cheeseburger combo was less than 5 bucks. A quality chicken salad (for a fast food type place) less than 6 bucks. And something that totally amazed me was the gift shop sold six packs of cold beer cheaper than any place I have ever seen anywhere. For example, a six pack of Dos Equis was $4.99, and a six pack of Henieken was $5.19. That is incredible. Cheaper than you can find on the street pretty much anywhere. I am guessing the cheap prices are to draw people away from the strip or to keep them in the facility to spend their money. You can certainly spend the day at SP and spend significantly less than you would at a big hotel on the strip. The prices alone make SP very desirable in my opinion. I know this is Vegas, but I hate to get gouged as much as the next guy. To review, I would highly recommend SP if you have your own transportation. Even then, count on 15-30 minutes to get to the strip, depending on traffic. It took us upwards of 45 minutes to get to the convention center each morning to get to our conference. Plan your driving accordingly if you have deadlines. If you have a car and the internet charge doesn't bother you, I say go for it. You will not be dissapointed. Hope this helps a bit.

We were so pleased with our stay here that we are already planning another visit. Our room was on the 21st floor and was very spacious and clean. With this hotel being off the strip (7 miles) it was very quiet and family friendly. There were no rowdy and loud guests in the halls, which we were pleasantly surprised. We ate at three of the restaurants at the hotel (the buffet, the seafood bar and the prime rib restaurant) and all had wonderful food for a very affordable price. We utilized the shuttle to and from the strip, at $8 per person for an all-day pass. The only down side was that it took one hour to return from the strip with all of the stops if you board the shuttle at the furthest stop on the strip. Even then, I thought the shuttle service was better than navigating the strip in our rental car. We also had a couples massage and used the couples spa area, which is so relaxing. The staff was very polite and helpful, with the exception of the box office staff. We utilized the bowling alley and was pleased with the pricing as well.

This was our first stay at the South Point as we were looking for a new hotel experience that neither of us had stayed at before. We chose the South Point due to their western events and excellent value. We are both cowboy/cowgirl types so it fit our lifestyle and the arena has numerous western events. There was one scheduled while we were there but was unfortunately cancelled. This was a little disappointing but understandable given these economic times. Was a little annoyed that the events people did not respond to an email sent to them about 2 weeks before arrival however. If you are familiar with the Orleans hotel it is roughly the same idea but newer and cleaner and a better choice in my opinion. Location \u2013 Yes it is off the strip so a car/rental is probably best if staying here. They do have a reasonable priced shuttle though we did not use it as we had a car. To those complaining that the shuttle isn\u2019t free, oh well it is a $20 - $30 cab ride and the shuttle is $8 so it\u2019s a pretty good deal in my opinion. Valet \u2013 Courteous, prompt, and professional. No complaints here. People the Valet services in Vegas are some of the best value there is. For a simple tip you get to drop and pick up your car at the front door, it's a no brainer when the Nevada winds are blowing and that sun is beating down. Save the sunburn, use the valet, you\u2019ll spend the tip money on water if you try to save it. Bellhop \u2013 Courteous, prompt, and professional. No complaints here either. Again folks use the bellhop, it is a tip service and why on gods green earth do you people want to drag your 3 bags each through the casino and onto the elevator (that I am inevitable on) when for a few bucks it is all handled for you. Just tell the Valet (which you should now be using after my previous lecture) that you would like a bellhop and one will come running, literally at this hotel. Check in \u2013 Smooth and much quicker than most of the strip hotels. No surprises like those stupid resort fees. Internet is not free however just like most if not all Vegas hotels. I really think it is time for the Vegas hotels to look into this silly extra cost. The infrastructure involved is not really that expensive anymore and it can be integrated into the main hotel computer system making it entirely wireless. I bet the first hotel to drop this silly price gouge makes up for it in month one with extra customers if they advertise it right. That said I am used to this internet issue and at least there wasn\u2019t a stupid resort fee (read \u201csurprise mark up\u201d), I really hate those. Casino \u2013 Very spacious and open. Loved the design and really it has to be one of the most spacious casinos in Vegas. I have read several comments about it being smoky. I have no idea where these people are staying in Vegas other than the South Point but this has to be one of the most smoke free casinos I have ever encountered in Vegas. If you dislike smoke then this casino is a good choice. Didn\u2019t win any money but this is Vegas folks and to tell the truth I found the machines to be fairly good as we didn\u2019t lose very much. Drink service was average to good and at times excellent. Tip the girls people and you will find a dramatic improvement in your service speed, don\u2019t be cheap, the drinks are free, excellent service isn\u2019t. Drinks are also VERY reasonable priced if you are not gambling. We picked up a couple beers on every pass through the casino at the bar on the way to our room and it was cold and convenient. Room \u2013 Very spacious and clean. Beautiful television with normal Vegas channel offerings. Music channels were nice to have, mainly left it on the country station for background music while we were in our room. Someone commented that there were no \u201cDo not disturb\u201d signs. Not necessary, just double lock your room door and no maid will bother you. Someway it signals them that you want privacy just like the instructions on the door say it will. Bathroom was beautiful though I found the tub to be of the useless tiny variety. Shower was good though so no real problem here. Just don\u2019t have any misconceptions that you and your partner are going to jump in the tub together, it\u2019s not going to happen unless you\u2019re both the size of a ferret. We had a king deluxe room and the sitting area was very nice. View was excellent also and I didn\u2019t pay extra for it. The room was one of the largest I've ever had in Vegas and we could have run laps for exercise if we wanted, however the fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t want to run laps but I did chase her around the room a little bit when time permitted. Shoe Shine \u2013 The courteous gentleman saved a pair of cowboy boots I thought I might have lost. For a few dollars my boots were looking good for a night on the town. Pool \u2013 closed while we were there (which I was warned about when making my reservation). We could see it from our room and it did look very nice. They are doing some renovations down there so it looks like it will be even better when it reopens. Food \u2013 Only ate at the Coronado Caf\u00e9 but loved it. The late night deals are unbelievable. I had steak and eggs and I believe it was $4, fianc\u00e9e had biscuits and gravy for $2. Really I have no idea how they do it but they do and it was good food. Service was excellent and they try to shove all the drunks in the very back so they don\u2019t annoy you too much. Gift Shop \u2013 Very well stocked and staffed, has all those little things you need or nice things for gifts for the folks back home. Best t-shirt seen in there was a child\u2019s t-shirt that said \u201cI\u2019m what happened in Vegas\u201d Got one of those for the grandson who is a Vegas baby. Checkout \u2013 Used the electronic checkout through the TV. Went smooth and with an efficient bellhop service we were out the door and headed home in no time. A few comments however. I do not understand how a western oriented resort does not have a country bar in it, this is just odd in my opinion. If you feel the need to party country style however Stoney\u2019s Rockin Country Bar is just a few blocks away and it is one heck of a place, look it up. The Las Vegas Outlet Center is very close and a trip to the Boot Barn right down the road is a must for any cowboy/cowgirl. Our overall impressions were very good. As I said I am a Vegas regular and I enjoyed my first South Point experience. In fact I enjoyed it so much this is where we will be staying for our honeymoon.

We also appreciated that the hotel is located a straight shot south on Las Vegas Blvd. - or we could take the interstate - a short trip to the strip either way. However, we ended up spending most of our time at the South Point (the slots actually PAY here!). I ***loved*** the bath products.

The curtains were lined and light-blocking but the light still creeps in around the edges.

We were stranded at the airport for 7 hours before our flight was cancelled. The airline gave us a vouchure for a \"cheap\" hotel room through their Stranded Customer Service program. So we got 3 rooms for $50 each. I am thinking we are going to be put up at a dive but at this point I didn't care. After sitting on the floor in airport for 7 hours, anything has to be an improvement. So we arrived at the hotel and were amazed at how nice it was. The check in was quick and they got us right into our rooms. I do have to say that the front desk clerk was a little short and unfriendly to us. We were traveling in a group of 11 and reserved 3 rooms. On the phone the rep only gave me one confirmation number and didn't tell us we needed 3 vouchures for 3 rooms. So she rudely told us, if you are getting 3 rooms we need 3 vouchure and 3 confirmation numbers. My fuse was already short from being stuck at the airport all day so I basically let her know that it was not my problem that the lady on the phone didn't do her job and we were in no mood to deal with her attitude. So she got us checked in after a few members our party happened to have a few of these vouchures in their pockets as they were handing them out to everyone on the flight. But the rooms were beautiful and big. Very clean. They had a bowling alley, movie theature, huge arcade and indoor swimming pool. If you are going to Vegas and taking kids or teens, this would be a great place. They had tons of video poker. The restuarant had a special at midnight. $3.45 for NY steak, hash browns, 2 eggs and toast. $15 for 4 of us to eat a steak breakfast. Can't beat that. The slots seemed to pay off quite well and a lot of us won. The casino is huge and well layed out. It is a classy place. It was a nice change from the Strip and all the people handing out \"girls to your room in 30 minutes\" flyers and half naked girls cage dancing all over. Even though it is out a ways from the strip, they have a shuttle for $7 for the day that will take you to and from the hotel to the strip. I will definately consider staying there when we go back.

Also, the cab from the airport to the hotel cost us $36 despite them telling us it's a $15 trip. They have a free shuttle but we were tired and didn't want to wait an hour. The clientele is older than most of Vegas and a lot of families with small children- though it's just as smokey. You can hear right through the walls of your room, but this was only an issue on Friday night. The Oyster bar is terrible. They only have one type of oyster and they are pre-shucked- so dried out and tasteless. The crablegs were also pre-cracked, very, very dry- VERY- and tasteless. Way over-priced. The Prime Rib place was decent- the Italian place was ok. hotdogs were the best part for 75 cents- though the lady at the cart seemed very bitter. the bartenders- every one we went to- were not friendly, nor attentive. Bingo was fun and the ladies there were very nice and helpful. the shuttle to the strip is nice to have but they stop at other hotels to pick people up- fyi. the bed sheets were uncomfortable and made us sweat as if made of some non-breatheable material. The SPA was the best I've ever been to for couples. The couples area was so nice and private and our massages were really good and well priced. I recommend getting a treatment together and then hanging out in the couple's area. you can order food there and make a day of it. It's nice because if you get a treatment- you get into that area, too- whereas just going into that area is $75 with no treatment.

Was it a fluke? Not at all! I returned to the South Point last Saturday and had a carbon-copy experience. I arrived early, about 8am, and the valet RAN to my car to open the door and welcomed me to the hotel. When he saw I had luggage, he asked if he could help or to call a bellman. I declined since I only had the one bag, and went to the front desk. I was cheerfully greeted by the desk agent, and when I asked if I could check in early, she said \"absolutely\" (so much for so many other hotels who insist on the \"3pm check-in time\" even if they have clean rooms, they make you wait anyway). The room was spotless, had a very fresh smell, and I didn't find a single thing wrong with it (although I must admit I'm still perplexed how a multi-million dollar resort with beautiful flat screen HDTVs in each room does not carry a single HD channel......took a little of the shine off what seems to be a flawless property). Food and beverage staff were friendly and very courteous, the casino staff - even the supervisors, all had smiles and welcomed you to their table. Sitting at a video poker machine, a cocktail server came over and asked me if I wanted a drink (as opposed to the other places where someone speeds past you muttering \"cocktails\", and you take your chances at getting their attention). EVERYONE was friendly, and it's the kind of place you don't mind spending your money, as you feel very welcome. Super family friendly - I saw many families about, and since the little ones can't go into the casino, the bowling center and multi-screen cinema upstairs is a delightful distraction. The pool was closed - not sure if it was because it was January and not that warm, or if they were remodeling, so that was a little disappointing, but in no way a deal breaker. You've heard about that word-of-mouth thing about when someone has a terrible experience they tell all their friends? Well I do the same thing when I find a place that gets it and understands how to take care of customers. I tell everyone I can about the South Point and how they need to stay there!

I had stayed there for 1 night before and I had a good idea of what to expect. The hotel is very nice. The room that I got for this stay was 505 so that is the room that I will describe. Previously I had a different room with a view overlooking the outdoor parking area. This time in room 505, I had absolutely no view. The view I had was of an exterior wall. I believe that I had one of the inner rooms. If you want a view, you might not get one with this hotel but that didn't bother me. I found the room to be very spacious for the price that I paid and it was very clean. Room 505 was a non-smoking room in a non-smoking floor but a few times I could smell smoke in the corridors when I left my room or when I was going back to my room. I've stayed in different Las Vegas hotels each year (MGM Grand, Golden Nugget, Monte Carlo, Stratosphere, and the Hilton) and I would say that the smell of smoke from the corridor.at this hotel was the most noticeable on a non-smoking floor. There were 3 conventions going on during my stay with the biggest convention being CES which was near the Venetian (on the Strip) so hotel prices jumped up dramatically for those 3 nights but I still found it reasonable. This hotel was hosting a motorcycle convention during my stay and I found that sometimes there were loud motorcycle noises when I tried to turn in early after an exhausting day of sightseeing. Another thing that I noticed when I turned in early is that I think that this hotel is somewhat close to a train station or train tracks since I remember hearing the train whistle a few times. I'm mentioning this but it was not bad. This hotel had a wide flat screen television attached to the wall with a variety of channels. I found that they had some 2 or 3 ethnic channels as well... the common Spanish but they also had a Mandarin Chinese channel which I found unusual for a hotel in the US. There were not a lot of Mandarin Chinese people that I could see staying at the hotel. For me, I could understand a bit of Mandarin so it was a somewhat pleasant surprise (although I watched mainly the US/American channels while I rested at my hotelroom). My hotelroom had 3 phones. I believe that previously when I stayed at this hotel last year (in a different room with a view), I also had 3 phones. There is 1 phone near the night stand by the beds, 1 phone near the table where you might sit to use your laptop, and 1 phone in the washroom/toilet. I didn't use the phone since I had my cellphone but I believe that all calls including local calls carry a charge. I ate at 2 of the restaurants at this hotel during my stay. I had a lunch buffet which was included in my stay (the tipping is of course not included) at Garden Bufft. I found the buffet to be quite good. The regular price for the lunch buffet is $9.99. I had dinner one night at Primarily Prime Rib. I found that the prime rib that I ordered was good. It wasn't the best that I've had but it wasn't bad. I would classify the service in both these restaurants to be very good to excellent. In terms of the Player's Club (Gambling and needed to use some of your coupons at the hotel), they did not have any promotion for getting a player's club unlike in some casinos on the Strip where they would give you credit for slot play with your stay or with the application of the card. I didn't spend much time gambling at this hotel. The coupon book that the hotel gave me showed expired dates. I checked in during the first week of January 2011 and the expiry dates on all the coupons were December 31, 2010. The person who checked me in did not automatically tell me that they were still good. I had to call or pass by hotel check-in later and ask them if they gave me the wrong book. The person who checked me in should have automatically told me when he checked me in that the coupons were still good and they were using it because the new books did not come in yet. They probably expect some customers to think that the coupons expired and not use them and/or not mention this. The hotel has a large parking area. You can park outside or you can park in a tier parking (they also have valet parking). I parked both outside as well as in the tier parking. The parking is not too far from the casino/hotel exit. The tier parking has an elevator which is connected to the hotel so you don't have to go outside (in case of rain) to get to your car in the tier parking. I was a bit disappointed with the housekeeping service during my 1 week stay. The lady who cleaned my room seemed to be more interested in her tip than replacing some of the items sometimes. I had used the ice cooler bag and threw it away after the first night and she didn't automatically replace it... nor did she replace one of my coffee cups. I left a note near the tip money and she didn't do what I requested. Also, when I placed 4 of the towels that I wanted replaced in the bathtub and left to do my sightseeing, when I returned to my room, she replaced it with only 3 towels. I was wondering whether I would be charged for the missing towel but the following day, she placed the correct number of towels for the room (she replaced the towel that she didn't put the previously day). The hotel has an indoor safe. I found it to be quite large and accommodated my laptop as well as a lot of my electronic accessories (camera, chargers, etc.), identification (passport and Nexus card), and money. I would say that this hotel is a great value if you don't mind not staying on the Strip. You will need a car (or be prepared to spend around $20 for transportation to/from the Strip). I had a rental car so it wasn't an issue for me. One last thing to mention is that the hotel charges ~$20 for internet for a 24 hour period for 1 device only... so let's say you and your guest each have a laptop and a mobile phone, if you want to use your laptop, that's one charge and if your guest wants to use their laptop, that's another charge on your room if both of you connect within the same 24 hour period. If you want to use your mobile smartphone for WiFi, that's another charge. This is the standard price that I see at the Las Vegas hotels that I've stayed at. Personally, I find the price to be quite expensive when I'm not in the hotelroom surfing all day/evening. I'm in my hotelroom for ~10 hours per day with 8 of those hours being asleep... so it is like paying $10/hour for internet. I would probably stay here again.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hooksett, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cNO FRILLS, BUT SOLID HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "fivedonahues", "ReviewID": "UR94830712", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel several times.

We had a car but the hotel has a shuttle with several stops on the strip and I think it goes about every 30 minutes with a reasonable $8.00 a day unlimited pass. Check in was easy and fast after parking in the garage which is free. There is also ample free parking in the front of the hotel which is outside. We didn't use the valet. The room was large and very clean with a big bathroom and comfortable beds. The casino was big and busy with any table game and slot machine that you would want, frequent free drinks and friendly people working there. The sports book area was huge. Friday nights offer any drink at the bar for $2.00. I had a huge delicious margarita. We received a free buffet coupon for each of us when we checked in and had lunch there. I'm usually not a fan of buffets but this was really good with fresh ingredients in small quantities and lots of selection.. The Asian grill part of the buffet was my favorite and you could pick out your own meat, veggies and sauce and they made it for you.

Of special note is the Spa which has fantastic packages, including 3 and 5 day spa use deals that we thoroughly enjoyed. The sauna, jacuzzi and pool in the ladies lounge area were great.

Especially when booked well in advance), and lastly, the Garden Buffet is not that great. When something is suppose to be hot, it was cold, and when it was suppose to be cold it was lukewarm. The food was so-so...PALED in comparison to the Bellagio's buffet (WOW). Anyways, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling here.

Here it is: Is it too much to ask for real cream with my coffee in the Garden Buffet? I mean, the Bloody Marys are a great idea for people who need at vodka drink at 7:00 a.m., but the rest of us, I think, would really appreciate REAL cream, not the non-dairy crap that is offered. I was very disappointed in that considering the caliber of your hotel. Now, moving on... I stayed at South Point for three days in the week before Christmas, lured by excellent reviews and a relatively good price. I want to make special mention of the friendliness of the staff: Everyone, from the bar to the buffet (who was literally unable to bring me real cream...oops...) to the check-in desk to the dealers were friendly. I only stay at hotels where the place has a reputation of being good to its employees, and South Point has an excellent reputation. This place is a lot like The Orleans: A very big place, kind of an oasis unto itself with nice rooms, full gaming, movie theaters, restaurants, bowling...I mean, it has everything but a trampoline and airport. And like The Orleans, this place is off the beaten path, about six miles south of Mandalay Bay on Las Vegas Boulevard. But no one should hold the location against them: If you can't live with it, stay elsewhere. it's also worth mentioning that by staying here on the South end, you are that much closer to Henderson, which also has excellent gaming and shopping. Alas, you are twice as far from old Downtown (I hate The Strip, and avoid it like the plague), which has excellent gambling. The rooms remind me most of ones I stayed at in Golden Nugget, with the same color scheme if I recall, though a little bigger. Nice big bathrooms and good beds. Very quiet on the 14th floor where I was. That's impressive since the main casino level is always humming with people. A light bulb in my bathroom was out. A phone call to the front desk remedied that in five minutes. The literature I had read before staying said there was a free shuttle from the casino to various spot - airport, the Strip - but the sign at the hotel said it was $8. Either the literature was wrong or SP \"updated\" their policy. On the other hand, there is not ridiculous \"Resort Fee\" like many other hotels have, which is just a way to jack up rates. In the end, South Point is a good bet.

I was traveling with Mom and was looking for a place for one night before heading out on a road trip. Seemed like the perfect opportunity to try South Point. At the time I was looking to make my reservation they were advertising an upcoming sale in a few days. I checked the rates for the date I needed; itwas $45 for the night. That was good price, but let me wait and see what the sale brings. Lo and behold the sale came and the rate was $45, although they claimed the rate was normally $70. I can understand if a hotel wants to limit the days they offer discount rooms. But it annoys me when they tell you they are running a sale on rooms they artificially inflate. My room was $45 before the sale, during the sale, and after the sale. I decided to \"splurge\" and spend an extra $10 not to be on a low level room looking at AC units. I Arrived about 5:00 and there was no line at check in. The man who checked me in was proficient in what he did, but not a single word of welcome or any kind of friendliness. I actually received a room on the 22 floor which is more than I bargained for. I requested a room close to the elevator and was given one only four doors away. I was pleased with the room assignment even though it was a less than enthusiastic beginning. There are many positive things to say about the room. It is very spacious, it must be over 400 square feet. The bathroom was also very roomy, although some may complain about there being only one sink. The bed was very comfortable. The room was very bright; there were many lamps and cieling lights that were helpful. (I only appreciated this later in the trip when most of our other rooms were so dark.) The room was also very clean. No complaints; I paid $55 for the room and I got a room worth $55. But then there were a few parts that just seemed to miss the mark. The most glaring shortfall were the towels. I normally don't notice the quality of towels. But these were the roughest, worn, and uncomfortable things I have encountered in a long time. They were woefully inferior to the quality of the bedding. Also I was surprised the room was as worn and beat as it was. Nothing overwhelming, but the carpeting clearly had high miles on it. In general, the furniture was scratched and scruffed up. But my biggest disappoinment was the overall decor of the room was, how shall I say; dull. The room lacked character; it was not modern or sleek, it was not classic. If ever you see one of those TV shows where decorators come in to jazz up a boring house, this was definately \"the before\" scene. I know its unfair to complain about decor, but it seems like a little imagination and a splash or two of color could really make these spacious rooms inviting and exciting. In a similar fashion, I also found the casino to be dull. It's hard to describe why but it just did not have a fun or upbeat energy for me. I planned on going to the spa, but after taking a quick tour I did not think the facilites justifed the $25 fee to use it. I had a decent stay and I have no regrets having given it a try. If I had to stay here again I would. But I am hard pressed to think of a reason to go out of my way to travel so far south to stay here again.

Over the last few years; I've had the privilege of visiting Sin City for work - and every time they've booked me here. Make no mistake - despite being a small company - these guys are fairly high rollers - and on average - they usually drop close to $100K in wagers in this hotel (if not more). I took my girlfriend here twice now; and she loved our last stay. I'm not a high roller by any means. I'm a simple guy. I've probably run at LEAST 20,000 points (dollars) through their machines - in the last 10+ stays - which isn't bad (I've had some luck). However - here's where the fun ends. My girlfriend and I were married this Halloween - on the strip. After staying in our suite at Treasure Island - she wanted to head back to South Point to relax (spa, etc.) from the hustle-bustle. Well - this has been a nightmare. First; the half-dead receptionist sends us to the wrong room type from what we'd booked 6 months before - and, to top it off - it was DIRTY (I mean - food and crap left behind - big time - like housekeeping thought the party they were tidying up after the guest was staying - not leaving). I then called the front desk - who told me that they'd hold the right room for us - and to give them a few hours (on their behalf - we arrived a few hours before check-in time - so no love lost). However; when we showed back up to the front desk - they acted as if they'd never heard of our issue - then said they needed to know who exactly we spoke with - and when (????). I wasn't taking notes when I called for the room. However; they eventually (rudely) fixed the issue and found the exact person. Sorry - I expected there to be notes on our account. Next; we booked a special on July 4th that gave us $10 in free slot play for our stay. We didn't have it on our player's club card - so we visited the members' area. Apparently - the ad was a scam - and we had to use the $10 before October 31st - even though our reservation was for November 3rd (WTF?). They wouldn't even give us a number to call. They just kept saying \"contact our promotions department\" (and yes - I carried a print-out of everything). Okay. I can handle all that. However; when gaming - the bartenders are now slow to bring you drinks (if at all). Before - I had no problem blowing $50 or $100 in a machine - if I'm in a good mood and drinks are coming regularly. Heck - even if we wanted to PAY for them - no one seems to want to wait on us here. Then there's the pool. A sign proudly reads \"OPEN FROM 8AM to 10PM\" (it's 80 degrees out). However, when we walked outside - we were confronted with 70+ people who were complaining the pool bar was closed. So - my (new) wife and I walked to the front desk for everyone to ask when it opened. Instead of getting a time, we received this response - \"Well - you shouldn't be out there any way. It's closed for season\". Then I apologized (like I had done something wrong) - and explained the sign stating it was open. Then she said \"That's because so many of you are out there they decided to let you use it\" (as if we were breaking some sort of unheard of rules). Sick of the poor, rude service, we smiled and left the desk area. Of course, in cheapo fashion - the pool was not heated. So - despite the hot weather - it was freezing. Real inviting. God - I miss the Golden Nugget. Stayed there last year this exact time of year - and swam every day. FINALLY - there's the \"Business Center\". Lovely. Everyone was complaining. Yes - they ship UPS - but only offer a metric scale (another WTF)? They actually acted as if we should know the exact weight of the boxes we just purchased (at $8 a piece) and packaged there. WHO IS A UPS/FED EX ship center that can't weight the item? They warned us of a $15 charge for incorrect weight. Just terrible. GET a scale. My God. They're $10. Even if it's not to the ounce - you won't be guessing - like the girl who worked there and just shook our package around and said \"feels like 20 pounds\". Bottom line - I always thought this was a special hotel. Something for the local gamers from the area that is hidden from the strip BS. However - we were wrong. My wife was going to visit the spa - but is now taking her business elsewhere. I understand Vegas is a busy town with lots of tourists - but; when folks have stayed with you more than 3+ times a year for the last few years - at least PRETEND they matter. This place sucks (only good food is The Oyster Bar and Deli - avoid ALL ELSE - aside from Micheal's - but it's $100 a head). Yes. We wanted to stay off the strip - but should have stayed at The Orleans or Silverton. You've been warned. Oh - and to the management - PLEASE - do not respond with a \"we're so sorry...we hope it doesn't detract you from staying here on future stays response\".

We stayed in a junior suite this time (birthday treat for me!) and it's fantastic - huge big bathtub, walk in shower and separate toilet; bedroom, living room. Lovely. Well worth it. 2. Much more friendly and relaxed place to stay than hotel on the strip. The staff are lovely, they really do look after you well. There are plenty of places to eat and drink on site, and a huge casino. The Italian and the steak house are as good as any you'd get anywhere - we love Don Vitos - best fettucine alfredo in the world! 3. Bowling alley, cinema, pool, spa, shop and casino (did I mention the casino?) Loads of things to do. Bottom 3 points: 1. Far from strip - you have to drive or take a taxi or shuttle to the strip. There's a small shuttle that costs $8 each way per person every second hour. Plenty of taxis, typically about $25 with tip, or the local bus to the station and transfer to the strip bus or other bus. Or your own car, of course. 2. Internet Access - $13 per day per device per room is really a bit steep. I understand they are probably locked into a contract with the providers, but it's time to push this one... 3. It's so far away from Ireland!

Now what I'd say is: a car is a must -even though there is a shuttle bus service, a car would be more practical. South Point is about 10 minutes drive from the airport and the strip,and is easy enough to find. We booked in without any waiting-it was about 8:00pm when we got there. When we got to our room we were slightly disappointed with the view from our window. We were looking out on to the parking garage roof. As we were staying for 14 nights we asked for a better view and we were told that as we had booked through Expedia these were the rooms allocated to them. We could however pay for an upgrade, but we didn't as it was quite expensive. Our room was on the 7th floor. The room itself was a generous size with a lovely king sized bed which was very comfortable. Everything was very clean, and uncluttered. One of the restaurants we went quite a few times was the Coranardo, where the service was very good and so were the meals. From 12 midnight to 6:00am they did specials so you could have steak and eggs for about $5. Because it was a busy restaurant there were times when we had to queue, but the staff worked very hard to get you a table as soon as possible. House keeping was really good,they kept the room to a high standard which we really appreciated. We only used the pool once in the 14 days as it tended to be very crowded. We went to the cinema but not to the Spa. We used the business centre to access our e-mails but found that quite expensive.

I've stayed at SP several times since 2008, and I've come away impressed with the hotel's quality and outstanding value each time. The hotel has grown a couple of wings since it first opened -- understandably so, as it must be doing well. What I like about SP is that the hotel has not been spoiled at all by its success, and it is meticulously maintained. Value: If anything, I paid a bit less overall for my last few stays than for those prior to 2009. Expedia and other travel sites offer great deals at SP, usually a bit better than what the hotel's website offers. I think the hotel's regular rooms are a great value at the regular $70/night rate, but I've always found them available -- at least for weekday stays -- between $30 and $40/night. For this price, you get a very comfortable and well appointed room that's about 500 sq. feet, with a 42\" flat-screen TV and, yes, my favorite hotel bath amenities in Vegas: Bath & Body Works Coconut and Lime. Location: Many TA reviews complain about SP's south-of-the-Strip location, but one would think they'd have considered the location before booking. I actually like the SP's location, especially since the opening of a new interchange on I-15 2 minutes' drivee from the hotel. SP is only a few minutes' drive south of the Strip (it's actually on Las Vegas Blvd., which is the Strip extended), and it's much easier to access and park at the SP. Both the garage and surface parking are plentiful and convenient. Food: Some reviews complain about SP's food options. Except for Michael's, which is reputed to be one of the finest (old-school) restaurants in Vegas, SP's restaurants are nothing special but provide plenty of affordable dining options. The main buffet restaurant is pretty good -- especially if you get coupons for free meals, as is usually the case with the coupon booklet SP gives you upon check-in. I'm a bit surprised that SP has slowly slipped down from the top 10 to no. 20 in TA's Vegas hotel rankings, but competition in Vegas is fierce. For my money, it remains the best hotel value in the city. I'll be trying a couple of new (for me) 5-stars on the Strip later this summer -- Vdara and the Encore -- but SP will remain my regular go-to Vegas hotel.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Needles, California", "Title": "\u201cHot Hotel for a cool price!\u201d", "Author": "MrDolby", "ReviewID": "UR74971078", "Content": "Excellent Off Strip Hotel & Casino & Resort!

On this occasion we were only going to have an overnight stop over between flights and decided based entirely on the TA reviews to try this hotel. How very disappointed we were. To me the hotel is exactly how I imagine a fairly down market Vegas hotel to be. Yes it is 4 star but this ranking can only be based on the range of the facilities offered and not their quality. To begin with the hotel is a long way from the strip (out taxi from the airport cost $34). The casino ( which as usual you have to go through to get to the room elevators) is very smokey and looks rather sad. The carpets in the corridor to our room had seen better days many years ago - they were worn grubby and badly puckered. The room whilst large and quite clean was very tired in appearance and the bed was awful. We wanted supper and having seen the Mexican restaurant mentioned in several reviews decided to give it a try. One look at the virtual fast food establishment made us change our minds pretty quickly and instead we went to the Silverado Steak house. This is obviously intended to be a cut above the other food outlets ( apart from Michael's). The service there was good and efficient but the food was mediocre at best and definately not worth the money. We had fun at the bowling alley but the pool area in the morning was ordinary at best and there were large numbers of families with young children . There were very long queues for breakfast and none of the options were particularly appealing anyway. Despite asking the concierge to order a taxi van to carry our family of 5 back to the airport after waiting for 50 mins one still hadn't turned up and we were obliged to take 2 at additional cost. The taxi driver told me that 5 seaters wouldn't bother going all the way to the South Point to pick up a fare beacause it was out of the way. We did not have that problem on the strip. Admittedly the hotel room was very cheap but do not be fooled but the 4 star ranking into thinking that you will be staying at an establishment that is only a little way down from a 5 star place. There is a world of difference both in the quality of the facilities and the overall ambience. Personally if I were to go to Vegas again then I would definately chose to stay closer to the strip and pay more to stay in some where that was a little special. I am sure that there are much better 4 star hotels around.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "El Dorado, KS", "Title": "\u201cGREAT VALUE; GREAT LOCATION for families\u201d", "Author": "KSScubaDiver", "ReviewID": "UR74505940", "Content": "The South Point Hotel is a great location for families.

So even if you are not in Vegas to gamble you could actually have a great vacation just staying at the hotel. The gambling and bingo halls would probably satisfy the gamblers too. We used the hotel as a base and drove the 15-20 minutes into the heart of the Strip were you would go to se the shows and the insane amusement park for grown ups and children alike called Las Vegas. We liked the free parking and that it is only a 5 min. drive to Food4Less, and disliked paying 13$ for internet (per unit per day) and 10$ for changing rooms. If you want to use the spa area and the training room, which we didn\u00b4t, you have to pay 25$ extra. But for the budget minded these extra expenses are avoidable and a hotel like this for just over 50$ per night through the weekend, is just incredible.

Checkin was quick and efficient. After having read some of the other reviews, we asked for a room higher than than the 2nd or 3rd floor and not facing a wall. We were told a room \u201cwith a view\u201d would be extra each night. We decided to forget the view, as we were not planning on sitting in the room looking out the window much while on vacation. We were given a room on the 22nd floor overlooking the pool and a great southern view spanning Las Vegas Blvd to past I-15. The room was spacious, with a sofa, table and chairs, desk area, flat screen TV, along with a king bed, which was just like Goldilocks bed \u2013not too hard, not too soft, but just right! Pillows are not feather, which is fine by me, as I am allergic to feathers and hate to be a pain for housekeeping to ask for non-feather pillows. The A/C was fully adjustable and was VERY quiet when the fan was on low or automatic. There are not one, but 3 telephones in the room, with one being in the bathroom next to \u2018the throne\u2019. Lighting was plentiful, with eco-friendly CFL bulbs (the hallways used CFL or LED lighting). The closet contained the iron and ironing board, along with an in-room safe, which is great to leave your winnings. ?;- ) The bathroom was not one, but two rooms \u2013 the toilet and bath/shower were in a separate room off the room with the sink and vanity. This is good since the coffee maker (also has tea) was on the spacious vanity, as was the hair dryer. Plenty of toiletries were left by housekeeping each day. The bath had a great rainfall shower head and there was plenty of water pressure, even on the 22nd floor! There was also a nice metal grab bar in the shower with a rough grip spot so if your hand was slick with soap, you won't slip. The rooms are very quiet \u2013 we saw a family with elementary school-age kids next door, but only heard them in the morning if they bumped into the wall. Security in the hotel was very good, with key check in the evenings before you get to the elevators. The swimming pool and hot tub were good. With the extremely high temps while we were there, along with a high school basketball tournament in town, we decided to use the pool immediately upon getting up in the morning. The hot tub, which is designed like a lazy river, was great. However the pool was a little cold, since the sun only hits it in the afternoon. Received coupon books upon checkin, which contained some good deals, including a free lunch buffet at the Garden Buffet on the 1st floor, which they also accept for breakfast. If you are looking for a fancy buffet, this is not the place to go. However, if you want good food at a very reasonable price (breakfast was only $6.99 with a Bloody Mary or Mimosa included), this is the place to go. We ate there once for dinner the night we checked in and twice for breakfast and were very pleased each time. Parking was plentiful, with some outside spots and a HUGE 7 floor parking garage which was great to help keep the car from baking when it was 110 degrees. The front desk people were very helpful \u2013 when I asked about using the points on my Player card toward my bill, they explained how to do that, along with pointing me to the Business Center when I had some items I wanted to ship home. Checkout was just as efficient. The only \u2018down side\u2019 to the whole trip was the long walk from the parking garage to the hotel room elevators, especially with luggage.

Oh yeah , the graveyard specials in the cafe.... Don't order a drink, cost $1.50 more than my whole meal...plain old OJ. To sum up do not stay here if you are not a local.

This was our first trip to South Point and we didn't know what to expect, but once we arrived - from check in to our room, we were treated with the greatest of service. All of the staff we came in contact with during out stay was pleasant! Even the housekeeping staff asked us BEFORE they cleaned out room if there was anything they could do for us while they cleaned our room. We've never experienced this at any other hotel and it was a great change to have the staff concerned about your stay with them. Our room was probably one of the biggest rooms I've ever stayed in. My jaw dropped in we walked into our room. Everything was so clean and well kept. There wasn't even that \"hotel smell\" in the room. I remember some gentleman on here complained about how the hotel didn't provide \"do not distrub\" signs - they do, its located on the desk and its a little square \"key\" you place in your keyslot on the door to your room. On the front of the key, its says \"service please\" in blue and on the other side is the \"do not distrub\" in red. Just incase anyone else would like to know where these are located. We did eat at the Garden buffet and it was so good! For lunch, its only $10 a person, a great deal considered a lot of the buffets on the strip are $25 dollars a person. The quality of the food was really good and the service was wonderful! There wasn't one food item that my husband and I wouldn't eat again - everything was so delicious! On Saturday night, we ordered a pizza from the snack bar by the bowling ally. It was soo good! They make the pizzas fresh when you order them and so once you get them, its nice and hot! It was so nice not travel outside the hotel to get delicious food at a great price! With the pizza, we were able to take it straight to our hotel room in no time! It was so nice to eat in our hotel room so we could relax. There was so much to do at the hotel that we were always able to find something to do. Which is great for those who have families! We even saw a couple of movies while we were there at there theather there. It was so nice and clean! The chairs were very comfortable and it was very nice movie experience. We even gambled a bit at the casino and won a couple of bucks. The only negative I can give about our stay was we weren't informed about the $100 security deposit before our stay. It was quite a surprise and we were out $100 dollars, so our trip plans had to change A LOT because of this. We were quite upset with this, but the staff did do their best to try to resolve this issue the best they could for us, even pulling some strings in order for us to do our deposit in cash. Other than that, our overall expierence was excellent! We are already planning our next trip to South Point within the next couple of months.

My one big complaint was the smokiness of the main area, which is where the casino is, so that shouldn't be such a big surprise. I also wish that the parking garage connected to where you can go to the rooms so you don't have to drag your luggage down the elevator, then through the casino, then back up the elevator. So if you need to bring in your luggage, go through the front doors. Which reminds me, valet parking is free. This hotel is only about 10 minutes south of the main strip so not far at all.

By our second night there, we knew we wanted to return for an extended stay. Our careers keep us nearly exhausted all the time. We knew we wanted a place where we could get away and just REST for a solid week and we knew that South Point would fit the bill. Since this was going to be our 3rd trip to Vegas together (and my 10th), we felt we had seen all we needed to see (excepting City Center) and wanted some place that would keep us entertained. We were greeted by the parking attendant with smiles and assistance. Check-in was a breeze and our room was just as we expected it - large and comfortable. We called for our bags and they arrived in a very short amount of time. The bellman asked if we had any questions or concerns before exiting. Shortly thereafter, I turned on the bedside lamps and discovered one was missing a bulb. I called the front desk and a member of the South Point team arrived IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES with a bulb. He also asked if we had discovered any other problems before he left. This man was so efficient that he didn't even wait around for a gratuity. We left a note for the housekeeper (along with a daily gratuity) asking for more towels and regular, not decaf, coffee. We always had more towels and coffee than we needed. Since we're from Atlanta and our body clock was still on Eastern Daylight time, we tended to sleep late. We were never disturbed by housekeeping during our entire stay. One day we didn't leave the room until after 2:00 and STILL found our room \"done\" when we returned at 5. The last week of May was a bit chilly by Vegas standards, so we didn't spend the amount of time we had planned at the pool. We had to resort to spending more time in the casino (oh darn).... and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. My wife's money management system proved to be a good one and we left after a week with a bit more money than we started with!! Everyone in the casino - from the gorgeous waitstaff to the cashiers in the booth - everyone was courteous and helpful. We enjoyed several bingo sessions during our stay and had a wonderful time in the bingo hall. We didn't win any bingo games but felt our money was well spent for the amount of enjoyment. We shared in the joy of someone sitting near us hitting bingo on the \"power ball\" or whatever it's called... and winning more than $5,000.00. Many on this site have commented on the smell of smoke in the casino. I must say that we did smell some smoke upon first entering on our first day. At no other time, however, did we have any trouble with smoke. We changed machines several times because we were sitting next to a smoker but that was not a problem and no different than in any other casino. Even though the bingo hall has an extensive smoking section, we never smelled any smoke there. We tried 3 of the restaurants while on property. The buffet was adequate and filling - as most buffets are. The food was of great variety and good value for the money. This is not a $20.00 per person buffet and we didn't expect the food to be of that caliber. The prime rib restaurant was outstanding, with a great atmosphere. The cafe food was always good and we ate there on 3 occasions. The service in all venues was great. We always use valet parking when in Vegas and never had to wait more than 5 minutes for our car at South Point. We visited MGM one day and had to wait nearly a half hour for the car. What a relaxing week we had. The weather warmed and we spent the bulk of our final 2 days at the pool. A waiter walked by about every 10 minutes asking if we needed any drinks. At one point, one of the lifeguards went around to everyone to check on their status, telling us to let him know if we needed anything. My wife enjoyed a wonderful message at the spa and reported that it was one of the best ever. We look forward to our next trip to Las Vegas and there is no doubt that we will spend our time enjoying South Point. We highly recommend this property. South Point is not The Belliagio and we didn't expect it to be. We enjoyed utilizing our money in other ways besides paying Belliagio prices.

The property is really only an alternative if you have a rental car, but they're so cheap these days in Las Vegas - and the hotel itself is as low as $42 midweek - that South Point should really be on your short list for a Vegas trip. Unfortunately, the hotel is beginning to show its age. The engineering staff hasn't learned how to stretch carpet, for instance - huge expanses of bumpy, rolling trip hazards greet you at elevator lobbies and down the long hallways. It's tacky and unnecessary. The casino itself is quite possibly the smokiest in all of Vegas - ventilation is quite poor and you'll find yourself holding your breath as you try to escape outside or into an elevator. South Point's poker room is a joke - it has never been finished and remains a wide spot near the escalators to the multi-screen movie theatre, with four forlorn flat screen TVs jerry-rigged on one wall. As with many large casino hotels, the powers that be have decided (wrongly) that, if they only have 12 channels of TV in the room, you'll go down and gamble more. As I guest, I have decided (rightly) that if you haven't joined the 21st Century on TV options, I'll downrate you and consider other options. The $12.95 daily charge for internet is smarmy as well. South Point's buffet is serviceable and has a very wide selection. When you check in you will receive a coupon book for each guest, and the first coupon is a free breakfast or lunch buffet for one - nice job avoiding the \"two for one\" or other slimy marketing caveats that other casinos foist on the public.

They have a hot tub with a small waterfall feature, a kids wading pool, and a large regular pool, cocktail service by a near by bar and also cocktail service by cocktail waitresses at/around the pool area. They also feature palm tress and free towel service. Silverado Steakhouse: 5 Stars, I shared a supper with one of the Casino Executive Hosts and we had a great meal. Prompt and polite effective service, an excellent steak, clean, comfortable, and classy--one of the true highlights of my vacation!! Actually, I came into contact with 2 of their Casino Executive Hosts, and I can honestly say that a full 50% of them were polite and decent/respectful towards me. Negatives: Many days before I was to arrive I made sure to request a refrigerator for my King-Smoking-Upper floor room. When I entered my room no refrigerator and no ash trays, this required me to go all the way back down to the front desk and stand in line all over again. Race and Sports book-Clean, modern and tons of viewing angles. Prompt cocktail service during the NBA Playoff games. Cocktail Service-Excellent, and some of the smallest uniforms for the cocktail service gals. \" Most \" red blooded American Men will appreciate this feature. The slots, at least for me tight, tight, and tight. Did I mention that the slots were tight. You MUST have a rental car to stay here as it is a good 5+ miles further south down Las Vegas Blvd South, But also much less traffic and crowds which I found to be a plus. Did I have a nice time on vacation at South Point, yes Would I stay again, probably Just a few minor things to get straighted out.

Our room (799) was huge,quiet and clean. Toiletries were wonderful.. The beds( 2 Queen) were very comfortable. We had a view roof which I would have requested a change if staying longer than 1 day. We had lunch at the Mexican which was good with GREAT service( can't recall his name).Also ate at the deli and had the BEST huge Corned beef sandwich for $10.00. Check in and check out were a breeze .Check out is 12 noon (bonus!) Hotel is close to the airport and car rental .So much to do without the hustle and bustle of the strip .Next trip will include an extended stay at the Southpoint instead of the overpriced and over hyped strip hotels.

The rooms are big, clean and extremely quiet. I can honestly say that this is the only hotel we have ever stayed at that we never heard any noise from upper or lower floors, neighboring rooms or the hallway. I never even heard the air conditioner cycle on. Service is excellent throughout the resort, and the good food and entertainment are enough to keep you on site for your entire stay. In fact, we only planned on a long weekend, but extended our vacation after the second day and stayed the entire week. And, we never left the property. This was the best decompressing vacation I have had in years, and with the extended stay, two evenings we actually watched a couple of season finales on regular TV, and we slept in everyday. One of things we really enjoyed was the 16 screen multiplex theater. At home, we never have time to go to the movies, and the ticket prices are outrageous. We just wait for the DVDs to come out. At the South Point, first run movies are $3.00 for seniors, before 4:00 PM, and we saw four movies during our stay. We would have added a fifth after checkout, but instead decided to eat at one one of the restaurants we missed, previously. Speaking of restaurants, the Garden Buffet is great for those who enjoy \"all you can eat\" fare, and the food is above average. However, after one meal and a free bottle of wine there, the better values are the numerous other restaurants on the property. In several stays, we have still not eaten at all of them. We really enjoyed Primarily Prime Rib, the Big Sur Oyster Bar, Don Vito's Italian, and the Coronado Cafe. The cafe is great for breakfast, and the late nite specials draw a big crowd. Who would think that you would have to wait to be seated after midnight, but the cab driver menu has some great specials! It is probably obvious by now, we aren't big gamblers, although we did walk away from the slots with enough to to buy dinner for two nights. We go for the resort amenities and have not been disappointed in several visits there. And, we will probably return again during the summer because of the mid-week special rates.

As mentioned, this stay was a total surprise, but I wanted to thank the staff at South Point for making our stay pleasant and bearable during a traumatic time for us and the 450 + BA passengers offloaded there! I won't harp on about the volcano or our personal issues with getting a flight re-booked, but would like to say that the South Point really is a great hotel; even though it was hard to stay positive in the situation we were placed. It is off strip, away from the hussle and bussle, but it is a little, (or quite large actually) gem with tons of amenities and a great atmosphere. The hotel has many facilities, bowling, bingo, restaurants, equestrian centre, games area, casino and a cinema complex as well as boasting a very nice pool with jacuzzis and pleasant spa area. There are many places to eat and a great variety of restaurants and a great shop which sells anything you may have forgotten or need. The rooms were very large, ours had two king beds, flat screen tv, nice lighting and a lovely re-fitted bathroom with seperate vanity area. The Bath & Body works amenities were lovely. Best of all - they have a tea/coffee maker - !!! a real bonus as you rarely find these in strip hotels. Houskeeping were busy bees and the room was always kept nice. The public areas were very clean and tidy. We only ate at the Garden buffet as this was included as part of our stay, due to our situation, (4 nights by the way). The food choice was great and plentiful. Breakfast was especially good with fresh juice, piping coffee and lots of hot and cold choices. The buffet was busy with long lines, (proving very popular) but we never waited long to be seated and were never rushed. If you stay, remember to check out the coupon book they give out, there are lots of great discount offers - we used one for a free bottle of wine with dinner - great. The desk staff were courteous and helpful and again, due to the influx of passengers from our flight, sometimes the the line was long, but we were processed quickly. Having checked the regular rates I would recommend a stay here - very good value for money and your $ will go much further than being on the strip.

The staff seemed friendly and the only complaints I have is that it was very smoky in the casino and their Internet access charge was excessive. The room was clean and A/C blew cool.

Not enough pillows either, i did not request more. Air worked fine and you could not hear it come on at all. As for the casino. Drink service is almost nonexistant. My husband and I received one drink the entire time we where playing, the cocktail waitresses are not very friendly and don't come around very often. We are not big gamblers so we don't spend alot of time at the tables or the slots. We took the shuttle to the strip one day, it was only $8 per person (if you pay cash). The shuttle drops you off at the fashion something mall. Which is fine but it was a bit of a walk to get to the strip, and then it is down on the far end near TI. The pool was the best part of the entire trip. Very nice and lots of sun and shade. there is a good size kids pool as well. If I where to bring the kids this would be the perfect place to go, very low key and lots of things for the family to do. I don't we will stay again but we did enjoy ourselves.

I really like as a Video Poker that they have a lot of decent VP machines. Yes I did leave some $ there, but at least I have a chance. Michael thanks for that. This may be the reason I stay my next trip all here. Silverton is doing the opposite. My host said I should be good for 4 nites. But I do hate playing the machines near the sports book.

I got a great Orbitz deal of $35 a night and got 2 free drinks, 2 free buffets, and free popcorn for the theater. I enjoyed going to the theater and sitting by the pool. The gaming staff was friendly and it was always easy to find a good table (blackjack, poker). The slots were pretty loose so I came home with some money. If this is your first trip to Vegas, you want to stay at Wynn or Venetian or something center Strip. If you've seen it all before, stay here. The buffet is pretty good and tons of selection but the oyster bar was absolutely delicious (try the lobster grilled cheese and their homemade chips). The DelMar Deli has cannoli - so good and their breakfast bagels were awesome! The hotel shop has a huge selection of good wines at very reasonable prices - you will have to buy your own corkscrew unless you can get one on the plane or in your luggage. The towels weren't as bad as the previous reviewer went on about. Pretty standard towels in my room. As everyone said before - the rooms are spacious and clean with nice amenities. Play in their evening poker tournament for a good tourney structure and fine starting chip stack. Small poker room but nice dealers.

Just to keep the facts straight, the South Point is on the strip and has a Las Vegas Blvd address. It is just located way down south on \"the strip.\" Hence, the name south point. The place is unglamorous but it provides the fundamentals very well. Some of the pros: Always speedy elevators Large basic rooms with quality room service No Resort Fees!!! Operates a clean and modern 16-screen movie theater for a fair price Has a large bowling alley and video arcade for the younger crowds Food and coffee is available throughout for a fair price Some of the cons: Air, air, and air. Zero fresh air throughout the building. There is nothing sexy and fresh about this place. Bowling alley becomes a baby sitter in the evening. Bottom line, I would recommend that you do not stay here if this is your first time to Las Vegas and you want to have that \"bright lights\" experience. Instead head central (TI, Mirage, etc). However, if you are a frequent visitor and, especially, if you drive to Vegas, then I would stay here. Get your fill of gambling, sleep, and food at the SP then take an afternoon drive to the central strip for the day. It is also closest to Primm which has the only Williams-Sonoma outlet store in the south west corner of the US.

If you are planning to stay at this hotel, you really must rent a car! And don't wait to rent the car while at the hotel - if you do, it'll require yet another expensive cab ride to wherever your rental car is. Best to pick up your rental at the airport. We didn't think to rent at the airport and ended up renting a car from Dream Cars located on the strip on day two. It worked out well - I would recommend Dream Cars for sure - but we did spent a lot of taxis until then.

This must be one of the last casinos in Las Vegas that is not charging that dreaded \"resort fee\". We found a deal on Expedia and paid $35.00 per night which came out to just over $39.00 in total. There was no resort fee!!!! How can you beat that price. South Point has a state of the art bingo hall, huge bowling complex, large theatre, and a very inexpensive convenient store that is open 24 hrs/day. We saw Avatar (3D) in their theatre and sat in comfortable leather chairs that rocked. How can you beat that? We bowled after midnight at a cost of $1.00/game. We bought cheap beer and inexpensive California merlot for $4.50 at the convenience store that sells everything from nuts to bolts. We were hungry one night and purchased delicous sandwiches for $3.00/ea. When we checked in we received a fun book that included one free lunch buffet ($9.95). The buffet is not the best we have ever had; however, it was good enough that we ate there 7 out of the 9 days. There are three outdoor pools (one being a large hot tub with tons of jets). One of the pools is for children and the other larger pool for adults. There is a walk up bar just outside the large pool. The rooms are very clean and the beds are made up with white sheets and a white down type blanket which were replaced every day. The towels were soft and not rough to the touch. We have no complaints whatsoever. Give South Point your consideration next time and let us help support their not charging a resort fee!!!!

In spite of its 26 or stories, South Point squats low about five miles south of Las Vegas -- assuming you're talking about the Las Vegas Strip most people come to visit, the south end of which is Mandalay Bay. If you have a car, that's no problem. Just understand, a jackrabbit would have to pack his lunch to walk to the Strip. And cab fare would kill you. South Point is too new to be run down. They keep the brass polished and the carpets vacuumed, but it feels a little downscale, nevertheless. OK, you want Bellagio, go PAY for Bellagio. At a Benjamin-or-so-a-night on a holiday weekend, it was a very good value. The room was large, the bed comfortable and the bathroom nicely appointed. Except for the towels. I did not want to dry myself with these towels. I did not want to put these towels on the floor to walk on. These towels appear to have been bought second-hand from the Bow and Arrow motel on the outskirts of downtown. You certainly wouldn't want to inspect them under UV light. The stacks of plump, soft, clean, white, absorbent towels folded just-so that live in my hotel dreams were nowhere in sight. What is WITH these towels? I live in Southern California, where there's no smoking, period. They've even squelched it on the beach. The smell of cigarette smoke in South Point would gag a maggot on a gut wagon, but this is Vegas and get over it. The restaurants are pleasant, the food well-prepared, waitstaff attendant, and there was a respectable bottle of Kendall Jackson Pino Noir to be enjoyed for $20. If you stay here, eat here. I can't comment on the hotel service, since I'm low maintainence and rarely ask anybody for anything when travellng. I'm an early-bird-gets-the-worm guy, and when I went down to the cafe for breakfast at 5:30 one morning, I ordered a cup of coffee and the $2.49 cabdriver special (eggs, hash browns, sausage, toast). When the check came, it was $4.99 plus tax. The coffee was $2.50 -- more than the breakfast. Gotcha! That's some weird level of cheap. But the real cheap stunt was at check-in. I had booked online through Expedia and when I arrived, I requested (I was very clear about this) a north-facing room with a view of the Strip near an elevator. The desk clerk said it would be a $10-a-night upgrade, so I bought in. But when I got to the room (23rd floor) it faced south, with a breathtaking view of northbound traffic on the I-15. When I called the front desk to inform them of their error, they said no, the NORTH facing view was an extra $20 (on top of the $10). I passed, since I refuse to be victim of a petty fleece. Besides, the strip so far away, there was no view of it, anyway. I had read in earlier reviews that the walk from the parking structure to your room makes the Bataan Death March seem like a stroll in the park. I found a space reasonably close to the elevators in the parking structure and decided to step it off. I counted 136 paces from my car to the elevator, and -- get this -- 367 paces from where I stepped off the elevator in the casino to the door of my room. That's roughly five city blocks, most of it past obese, elderly women sitting at penny slot machines and sucking on cigarettes. But, like I said, you want Bellagio, go PAY for Bellagio. Hey, Vegas is Vegas, warts and all. If you don't like it, don't go.

Bathroom had a coffee maker & Bath & Body Works travel sized items. They seemed to be stingy on the towels, so we had to request more towels. We had a view of the pool, but we only saw 1 person in the pool (in december?)The room was a standard room, no fridge, no microwave.

Stated we would pay but the chap said there was no charge. Had room 1969 which is the 19th floor and sort of looks NW out of Vegas. Nice view of the mountains etc. Room was clean, comfortable and met all our needs. My wife especially likes the Bath and Body Works products. Maid service was very efficient and the room was always clean and bed made up etc. We did all our gambling at the hotel, video poker and slots and found that our money lasted a long time. Hit some bigger wins on the penny slots which enabled us to play longer though we came equipped with cash anyway! Fantastic bar service and excellent cocktail waitress service on the floor when gambling, never had to wait long and they were fast and efficient, ok, have to say, the outfits waitresses wear are pretty awesome, my wife allowed me to stare if I wanted as we were on holiday! Dont know how they can wear that at 6 in the morning though!! Ate in nearly all the restaurants except for Don Vitos. Loved Primarily Prime Rib though I didnt realise they had a set christmas menu, still, had the prime rib and it was huge and delicious. Only place we werent enthused with was the Silverado, thought that the service was a bit rushed [trying to get us out of there, collecting plates while we were still eating] and was a bit over priced for what was really just an average steak. Still, if this was the worst meal of the trip then it was still a good bad meal! Yes the South Point is a fair distance from the strip but we had rented a car and the drive in and out of the city was a breeze.

Unfortunately, my trip was not what I hoped when I discovered the VERY STINGY payoffs for video poker and woke up to a nonfunctioning toilet on the first day of my stay. FWIW, the water pressure in the shower is also pretty weak. I was trying to be optimistic because the rooms are particularly large and clean if you don't look too closely. The carpet in the hallways is lumpy and stained in places, and there seemed to be some crusty substance on the decorative quilt on the bed. The bathroom seemed very clean. When I contacted the front desk about the problem with the toilet in my room, they said they'd send engineering up. I guess I was to use a public toilet in the meantime, especially not knowing how long it would take for engineering to show up. I politely requested compensation, and the front desk rep offered me two buffets with a rather unfriendly look on her face. I thanked her and said it was quite an inconvenience to be in a room with a broken toilet. I didn't notice the coupons were for breakfast, which we wouldn't be able to use, so I had to go back and request lunch, standing around for another few minutes while another front desk rep retrieved lunch buffet coupons. I ate in the Coronado Cafe, and the service was very friendly and fairly efficient. The food was cooked as I asked, but bland and unimpressive. The selection for casual dining is small, and I would have appreciated a bigger selection for the teenagers I was traveling with. I'm still at South Point Hotel as I write this, and I'm quite sure I won't be back. Hopefully, there won't be another problem with the toilet.

With a rental nothing is more than 10-15 minutes away anyway. I also would prefer there were no charges for the Internet and exercise room, but the fact is that is the norm in LV. I don't know of any property that offers complimentary Internet and gym access. Criticizing the SP for something everyone else does doesn't make sense to me. So we what it doesn't have, how about what it can offer. For my money, what little of it I need to spend to stay at SP, there is no better property in all of Vegas. During a recent stay I paid all of $100 for a 3- night stay. For that very reasonable price I got to stay in a large, clean room that would put to shame many room from higher-end hotels. The casino is a perfect size as well. Big enough to offer a variety of games, but not so large it had different zip codes. During my visit I had two fantastic meals - one at Primarily Prime Rib and the other at Silverado (there pretzel bread is the absolute best). Having stayed at SP before, but not having tried the buffet, I also decided to give it a whirl. It was satisfactory. I have nothing to either overly complain or compliment.

You can sit on the casino floor which I do not find relaxing or you can go upstairs and listen to a bunch of televisions in the Mexican bar. I recognize that the owner of South Point is not pursuing the Hip Hop demographic but a simple club would help. If that is not possible it would be a significant selling point if the resort provided a shuttle to the strip. Even if there was a charge for a 24 hour pass to go back and forth it would be preferable to being completely isolated and dependent upon taxi cabs.

There wasn't too much to look at, unlike some of the hotel/casinos on the strip. The room, however, was very nice.

The pool area was also extremely nice- there were even cocktail waitresses who brought around drinks to you in the pool or on your beach chair. We unfortunately found that the food at the hotel was nothing more than mediocre. The service was fine though. A few things I did not particularly like about the hotel were: -There was no refridgerator in the room- it would have been nice to keep some snacks or drinks cold. -There was a substantial charge to use the fitness facilities. I thought that was kind of tacky. I do like to use a gym when I travel, but I didn't want to spend $15 per day for that!

Any intelligent person is well aware that the South Point is not close to what is referred to as the \"Strip\". If you are not aware then I suggest you check next time. Almost NO casino hotel offers much in the way of TV channels. They do this on purpose as they don't want you sitting in your room watching TV. This is not just at the South Point. Charging for the Internet and gym/spa is standard for casino/hotels. If you want to have lots of TV channels and free Internet access then stay at a non-casino hotel.

The rooms were very clean and comfortable, and this was the quietest hotel in which we have ever stayed. We heard absolutely nothing through the walls or floors during our entire stay, except for running water during early to mid-mornings, and this was only audible in our bathroom. The in-room safe was a nice convenience, though we left our diamond studs and other expensive jewelry and bundles of cash at home (just kidding). The food was very good at each restaurant we visited, and of particular note was the prime rib at Primarily Prime Rib, the crab legs and clam chowder at the Big Sur Oyster Bar, the biscuits and gravy in the Coronado Cafe, and about anything in the Del Mar Deli. The turnovers were each equivalent to about one-half of a fruit pie, and I am embarrassed to admit how many of those flaky pasteries we ate during our stay. Also, their sandwiches seem a little high in price, but they are HUGE! The pools (and the whole resort) is family friendly. The main pool area is actually three overlapping/connected pools. If I recall correctly, the two on the ends are graduated and only about 3 feet deep max, and the center pool was only 5 feet max. There were a lot of families there, but we didn't feel crowded. One day, we spent most of the afternoon in the multi-screen theater (seniors get in before 3 PM everyday for $3, using their Club Card). It was a nice break from the casino activities. Also, there is a 60 lane bowling alley next to the theater (both upstairs over the casino floor), but there was some kind of tournament going on when we looked in, with bleacher seats set up and only two people bowling. Also, there is a small arcade right outside the bowling alley, which had a pretty good, but limited assortment of the usual games.

I had read some great reviews on here and decided to take the plunge because the price could not be beat. We had an excellent time. The rooms were huge (about 500 square feet) with a large bathroom. The shampoo and lotion were from Bath and Body Works, a nice touch. The bed was comfortable and the room was very, very quiet. We never heard a peep from the rooms on either side, and we hardly saw anyone in the hallway. It was lovely. The only thing I would have liked to see in the room would be a mini fridge for keeping drinks cool (instead we used the ice bucket). Other than that, the room was fantastic! Our room faced the freeway and the pool, which was fine. Although we didn't spend time in the pool, it looked really nice and well kept. There were plenty of towels and each morning the staff was out there hustling to get it cleaned up and ready. During our time at SP, we bowled on the cheap with a coupon they gave us at check-in. It was fun, and not crowded. We also partook in the breakfast buffet buy one get one free special, I think it was about $9 for both of us. The food wasn't super fancy, but it was fine and the service was prompt and pleasant. All of the hotel bars have a happy hour special from 4-10pm, $1 for any drink. Again, we didn't partake (we're not huge drinkers) but that's a good deal. The gym facility here costs $15/day I believe. Rather than pay that, we drove to the 24 Fitness right down the street and used our membership there. There were plenty of grocery stores and chain restaurants nearby if you want to purchase dinner out or get water or snacks to have in your room. Parking at the hotel was, of course, complimentary.

You can tell I'm from the east coast where everything is smoke-free. We loved the room, a king on the 20th floor overlooking the pool and mountains in the distance. It was very roomy including the bathroom. They must have some pretty thick walls because we heard nothing when sleeping at night. Again, why have elaborate TV's and offer no HD channels. Yes the hotel is a distance from the strip. However there is a lot to do here. The pool complex is nice and big. The second floor offers a movie theater, 60 lane bowling ally, bingo center and an arcade. Of course there is the casino and sports book. I can say we tolerated the smoke and participated in a little gambling ourselves. We grabbed a bite to eat at the deli. Kind of ironic that many of the restaurants are open on the casino floor, but ask you not to smoke. I guess they never heard of drifting.

The pool area was very relaxing, not overly packed like it was for some, and the poolside waitress kept the drinks coming! We didn't get to go bowling, but we did catch a movie at the Theater with some of our friends that were staying on the strip. I think they enjoyed that more than we did!

Pros: * Price * Fast elevators (2 banks) to rooms * Free in-room safe * Free coupon for some free slot play * Spacious bathroom plus couch and coffee table in standard room * Digital thermostat * Large windows (view varies) * Newer look/feel, with modern color palette in rooms * Rooms felt and looked clean Cons: * Always enormous lines at registration, no matter day or time * No electric, sensor-operated doors at front of hotel--you get the joy of wrestling them open manually each time, and they are heavy * A very long hike to and from main entrance to rooms, doubly challenging when dragging your suitcases, and each way you are forced to navigate through a casino thick with smoke (asthmatics beware!) * Limited hours for food vendors, and only Pepsi throughout hotel (yes, that matters to some of us) * Skimpy supply of thin towels -- one per person; we requested extras several times, but only received them once * We asked to borrow a bottle opener several times from room service, and it was promised every time but never delivered * Shower was very low pressure; water only lukewarm * Very few TV channels, and an odd mixture--many horse racing channels (for placing bets), Chinese and Spanish news channels, but not your typical CNN, HBO, Weather Channel, or anything useful * Our TV picture tube blew out on the third day, was reported but never replaced during our stay (not that I really missed my nightly dose of the news delivered in Chinese anyway!) * Business center had very limited hours and was very expensive--around $12 for an hour of Internet, and you could not save any of the paid time for later use * We had read the slots were the second loosest in Vegas here, but that was not our experience * The Garden Buffet was very disappointing. Food was poor to average at best. For dessert I chose a cheesecake which turned out to be warm Jell-O cheesecake (not the real stuff) and it had congealed fruit topping. It had been sitting out for a long time without refrigeration. Salad bar was limited and the lettuce was wilted.

First of all, let me please start with\u2026 Pros & What to do while staying @ South Point Casino 1. Use your coupon! You will receive a small coupon booklet as you check in. I personally used $25 Slot Machine Credit Coupon as well as Buffet coupon (2 for 1). And also, take the gift giveaway coupon to the small grocery store in the casino, and you will receive a key chain. Not very valuable one, but remember, it\u2019s free. :) 2. Buffet & Other restaurants Do not expect 5 star high quality dishes at the buffet, but certainly, it\u2019s not bad at all! Many different kinds available! At least, I found it delicious. And also, check out the other restaurants as well. 4 to 5 different restaurants available including Steakhouse & Mexican restaurant. 3. Slot Machines I only played slot machines rather than the table games and I actually saw some people hitting the jackpot. I saw a gentleman winning $4,000 playing Video Poker game. I personally had ups & downs but overall, they wouldn\u2019t just take your money right away. Just learn when to STOP playing when you earned some! :) In addition, ASK FOR LOCAL BEERs or COCKTAILs while gambling! They are all free! I was able to enjoy playing slot machines while drinking beers. Yay!!! 4. Family Oriented; Movie & Bowling We watched Transformer Two on 24th of June. We expected a lot of people, but it really wasn\u2019t bad at all. Get a free popcorn using the coupon!!! Right beside the movie theater, you will be able to see a huge bowling center. Again, use the coupon if your plan is to play bowling! Please be advised that I did not swim nor have a massage. I am not sure how the swimming pool or the spa qualities are like @ South Point. 5. If you have your own car, it\u2019s not a bad idea to drive away from Strip (Casino) area!!! I visited Hoover Dam as well as Red Canyon Region. It takes about one hour to get to Hoover Dam from South Point. Check out \u201cLake Mead\u201d too on the way to Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam definitely offers something to watch! Now, let\u2019s go over\u2026 Cons & Why South Point Casino cannot be Five Star Hotel 1. Smoky Smoky Smoky Casino. Yes, I am very well aware of the fact that all the other hotels are the same as well where we will have lots of smokers while playing games. At South Point Casino, I do realize that they have the air filter system; however, there are perhaps too many smokers or what? Compared to any other hotels on the Strip, you can definitely feel the low quality of the air. After spending about an hour playing slot machine, you will be able to smell the smoky smell from your clothes all day long. 2. Distance from the Strip You don\u2019t have a car? Then, I am pretty sure that your plan is just to stay @ South Point. It does take 15 minutes to 30 minutes (depending on the time) to get to the Strip. Other than these two, I really don\u2019t have any other points to complain about. As you see, I have more PROs than Cons; and therefore, I would rate this hotel as FOUR STAR. Overall, you are just receiving what you \u201cpaid\u201d for. You wouldn\u2019t be able to stay @ Bellagio or Venetian with the money you are paying in order to stay @ South Point, right? There\u2019re always reasons to have the rooms available @ very cheap price compared to the market price @ Vegas. Oh! well, at least, I personally was very satisfied with South Point after all.

Can't beat the price! In fact, I got a $45 a night room rate through Travelocity for the week days portion of my stay, which was lower than the supposed advance discount rate offered through the event that I was attending. For such a low rate, you get a big room, with all the amenities. While the style and decoration may not strike you as luxurious, everything is of a good quality. The carpet, wall treatments, molding, bathroom floor and tile, fixtures, etc. The room had a king size bed, sofa & coffee table, small round table with 2 chairs, plus a separate desk with a chair. And even with all of that furniture, there was still lots of open floorspace in the room. You've no doubt read about the bowling alley, movieplex, bingo hall and equestrian center. All are very modern and very popular. I ate a lot of meals off-site, so I don't feel qualified to comment on the South Point's restaurants. The casino had all the typical machines and table games, but was small by Vegas standards. And it was very smokey. Obviously one area where they saved construction money was by not installing a mega-strength filtering system, like they have at some of the higher end Vegas hotels. Is the hotel's location a pro or a con? I would say that you just have to be realistic about the tradeoff of off-Strip location vs. value. South Point is located far south of what is considered the southern tip of the Strip ... Mandalay Bay, Four Seasons, etc. You absolutely cannot walk to the Strip. Taxi is approximately $30 each way, more if you go to the northern area of the Strip. The famous Deuce bus that many visitors use to economically get up and down the Strip does not come anywhere near the South Point. At this point in time, the hotel does not offer a shuttle to the Strip. So if you will travel to Vegas by car, you won't have an issue. Otherwise, I strongly suggest that you rent a car, for a least a few days. I did that and was pleasantly surprised that having a car in Vegas was not a hassle at all. All of the Strip casinos have free self-park garages, and even if you use valet parking, the only cost is a tip to the attendant. Traffic wasn't that bad either, even on Las Vegas Blvd. Now some of the lack of parking fees and traffic may have been because the visitor counts are way down during the current recession, so if you are reading this review months later, you may want to investigate to verify that these factors are still true.

This is a great hotel that is family oriented. They have a large outside pool that is 4 feet deep but doesn't get to warm so during our stay it was weird that adults were in the kiddie pool and kiddies were in the spa/hot tub with no one really in the large pool. Also note that although it is family oriented, i noticed a woman laying on her stomach with her top off tanning, i saw this on at least two different days, no one complained.

The location, obviously, is not good compared to the strip casinos, but this should be obvious. My real problem was with the service. As I've seen others write, I had a long wait at check-in. When I finally got to the front, the lady at the desk did not apologize for the wait or even acknowledge me. I had to say, \"Hi, checking in\" before she even looked up. After that she said maybe ten words to me and sent me on my way. When I called down to the front desk later because of a problem, I had a ten-minute wait on the phone, and then they couldn't even solve my problem. The rooms are nice, I will give the casino that much. But the casino and lobby area is nothing memorable. It's basically one big room, and has nothing special about it. It's much smaller than the strip casinos, too, and doesn't offer nearly the same amount of restaurants and bars. Add all this together, and I was disappointed in my stay considering how rave the reviews are on this site.

Table minimums were mainly $10, but even on this holiday weekend they kept a few $5 tables open all the time.

The only complaint we could make was that the pillows were on the small and hard side. If you are driving in, bring your own. Nice flat screen TV, Great outdoor view of the pool on the 15th floor. Room smelled amazing, perhaps it was the great Bath and Body Works complimentary toiletries in the room daily. Very clean, important to us. Lots of families with small children and teen sports teams over the weekend. Not the same frenetic pace and clientele as the Strip. Used by a lot of locals, apparently. Easy to use the self-park garage, or valet. Food was more than adequate and the prices were so reasonable, my goodness, buffet breakfast was less than a meal at a popular fast food restaurant. Loved the Mexican restaurant upstairs. Surprise was the Deli, good food, but overpriced. All staff was very friendly. Pool was awesome, lots of room when we were there. Seemed much more family oriented with the bowling alleys and theatres. Plus large equestrian centre. Researched for a couple of months before deciding on this Hotel and we HIT THE JACKPOT.

So we got 2 rooms - one for the kids and one for the Mrs. and I - I tell you what, I was surprise at the cost $35.00/Room/Night - $70/night less than renting a toy hauler. The rooms were clean and big - nice to shower in a large bathroom after a day of riding. So here's a short list of: Pros - Great value for the money Coupon book with 2for1 buffet, and $25 slots (which I won $120 - not bad!!).. Clean rooms Large bathrooms Cons- Bed is not as comfortable - better than a toy hauler but not as nice as say the Marriott Casino has poor air circulation - but once in your room and floor - can't tell Hit and Miss Service - great a the cafe, poor at the cashier (need some happy pills for them!!)

If I wasn't choking on the air pollution, it would have been an good stay but since I can't hold my breath for more than a few seconds, I ended up miserable the whole time. When I first walked into the room, it was beautiful but the air was horrible. I looked into the AC intake filter and saw it was caked with years worth of crud. Called the front desk and they sent up a maintenance man to change the filter. A little bald headed chap with an attitude showed up, cussed at the 2 screws he had to turn to take the cover off, proceeds to bend the filter in the middle creating a crease that breaks any chance of a seal and stormed off like he had something better to do. The windows do not open so there is no chance for fresh air unles you take the elevator down and walk past a row of 30-40 ringing machines and step outside. Something i did several times near the end of my stay. The walls are paper thin I could hear people laughing shouting from 2 rooms away. I booked for a week as I was relocating to Vegas and spent most of the day driving around looking at houses for sale. But in the evenings I would browse online listing. By the end of the week stay, my internet charges added up to $90. Yep.. a cool $12.99/ 24 hrs A service that most hotels gladly offer for free. I guess they must be ashamed to charge for the internet cuz they say on the TV menu that \"only wireless requires access code, the wired internet is free. This turned out to be a blatant lie as I tried to connect with my own cable and it took me right back to the to the \"pay now or no internet\" page. When I asked the maintenance man what that \"only wireless requires access\" meant, he shrugged and rolled his eyes and pointed to the cable and repeated that it is $12.99 that requires an access code. The TV is nice. A big 42 flat screen hanging on the wall. You turn it on and it starts blaring ads for the casino. Ok, no problem, change the channel and find there are very few choices. Put it on something you want to watch and a few minutes later, it reverts back to a droning female voice suggesting over and over again \"what are you waiting for, click menu now for some porno. Titles will not show on your bill. Click menu now. What are you waiting for... aaaarrrrggghhhh \" Click!!! the TV is off. Over all I would not have complained about anything if the air was clean.

I moved to an extended stay hotel just down the street from this place. I can breathe, I am paying less than 1/2 of the other place. Internet is free. I am happy. I feel sorry for the people that have to work there all day long day after day. It would make me physically sick as I could hardly stand 1 week of it.

(See, I did think of a few nice things. ) Here is the rest: The staff was generally rude, no matter if it was restaurant or coffee shop or front desk or bell staff. Just rude, couldn't care less if you return to this hotel or not. We booked this hotel over New Year's because we got a good price, and were counting on the shuttle to the strip, which was cancelled without notice on December 15. I have filed a complaint of false advertising with the Las Vegas Better Business Bureau. We had to use taxis a lot to accomodate a handicapped member of our group, since the bus stops were too far for her to walk. A one-way trip to the strip with taxi was minimum $25. When possible, we used the public bus, but it took more than an hour to get to the strip that way. Our 14 year old son got food poisoning in the Coronado Cafe. The front desk supervisor, Tiffany Cox, refused to comp this meal or the resulting laundry costs. This would have been a good will gesture in the total amount of about $45.00, after we were in the hotel a week and spent a great deal of money there. But as I stated before, the staff at this hotel couldn't care less if they have guests or not, apparently. By the way, I also filed a complaint with the Las Vegas Health Department regarding the food poisoning. I could go on about this dreadful experience, but to be honest, I am starting to get a headache just remembering how bad it was.

Pros: 1. So much to do! Bowling, movie theater, large casino, lots of restaurants, arcade, equestrian center, shows, bars, night clubs, a very nice spa/gym - all right in the hotel! 2. The room! Very large, had a sofa, small table and desk, separate bathroom area from the sinks/vanity area. The bed was wonderful! 3. The view from the higher rooms are amazing. We were on the 17th floor, and had a million dollar southern view. 4. Price - Can't beat the price for the room - anywhere. 5. Staff - everyone was really nice. 6. Gift shop - we found out from an insider that the alcohol they sell at the gift shop is the lowest price - anywhere in vegas - and they were right. Really amazing prices on nice wine and premium liquor. 7. Breakfast buffet - great price for a lot of great food - be sure to use your coupon book! 8. We also really enjoyed the Mexican restaurant. 9. Cleanliness - the place is immaculate - the cleaning staff is really friendly and very efficient. 10. Very large flat screen HD TV. 11. Not far from anything - short drive to the strip and shopping. 12. We had a car - and liked being off the strip - keep in mind that all parking on the strip is free, so it's not that hard to get around down town. 13. Very nice spa and gym. (although you do have to pay to use it) 14. Great room service! Cons: 1. Paying for gym usage - this wasn't a big deal for me, it was 69 dollars for 5 days which included use of the spa - which was really nice, and worth it, in my opinion. The spa has a hot jetted tub, steam room, sauna, cooling pool, aroma therapy showers, a lounge with cool drinks, hot drinks, large flat screen tv, and plenty of places to relax. I would have like to see an option for just gym use - but again, it wasn't that big of a deal, definitely worth it if you are wanting to work out. 2. Internet fee of 12.99 per day. I looked around and most hotels in Vegas charge for Internet, I think they would get even more bookings if they offered free or reduced Internet, it is a great business hotel, and would be even better with free or reduced Internet. I can't think of any other cons - I would definitely recommend this hotel!

Also the safe was lower in the closet so I didn't for once have to get on a chair to see if I had everything out when leaving. The hotel gives a coupon book on check in that was pretty useful: a bogo breakfast or lunch buffet, a discount on the deli (huge sandwiches), free beads, free popcorn at the theatre ( great diverson) and bowling discounts. Free drinks at the mexican restaurant, and the food was reasonable and really good. The only day the casino was smoky was on the sunday of the nfl playoffs, otherwise not noticable. Parking is a bit far if you have to park in the garage, but I usually found a spot out front. Bingo was friendly and cheap and slow enough for mom to follow and I actually won $300! We requested at check-in a high floor and close to the elevator which was cheerfully honored. I played many of the slots and came home with more than I left with so a good trip. A friend joined us and it was no problem for her to get the free airport shuttle at 5:50 am, with only a phone call the evening before. I opted for a car rental from car rentals dot com with Payless for $118 for the week. Her room had 1 king bed and a sofa, ours had 2 queens and a table. All beds have duvet covers and there are alot of extra pillows. Hot water was really hot and instant. Really cool to see all the cowboys arriving for the bull riding weekend. Last tip is for shows, we booked Bette Midler at Caesars on a discount from travelzoo for $45 in the upper balcony, on arrival we were laughing coming up the escalator and the usher could see we were having a good time and upgraded out tix for free to the lower floor about 20 feet from the stage, $250 tix.

Their website does not lie and we found our room to be quite luxurious, compared to what we were previously used to. It was clean and everything worked just fine. The King size bed was very comfortable as were the oversized pillows. The bath products provided are really cool too. The shower aptly delivers. It\u2019s great to have a 42\u201d flat screen TV but the cable package is very (very) limited and not in HD so that sort of kills the deal a bit. The view from our room (5th floor) was a nice big cement wall. But we did not go to Vegas to stay in our room and watch TV so no big deal. Being away from the strip area is actually a plus because you\u2019re not stuck in traffic when you\u2019re heading back and it\u2019s quieter all around. The casino itself seems just like any other and we don\u2019t gamble so we can\u2019t really advise you one way or the other. We had brunch at the Garden Buffet which was OK considering we used the two-for-one coupon given to us upon checking in. But I would have been reluctant to pay $13 for that quality of food. We also tried the Del Mar deli and as reported, one sandwich is good enough for two \u201cnormally proportioned\u201d individuals. And satisfying enough for those with a BIG appetite. The convenience/gift/liquor shop is second to none for liquor prices. I had the opportunity to compare certain product prices with supermarket prices and South Point beat them by an average of 5-10% so there\u2019s no need to drive elsewhere to get your libations. They obviously understand the concept of one-stop shopping and apply it without taking their guests for idiots (compared to places who charge airport-like prices). Overall, we would definitely return to the South Point providing such advantageous rates are still made available. If you\u2019re renting a car, it\u2019s the best deal in Vegas! Tip: if you booked Cirque du Soleil tickets in advance for pickup at the venue, don\u2019t wait until show time to get them unless you\u2019re sure to be there more than an hour before. If like us you go to Red Rock Canyon for the day and your plan is to swing by the venue around 16h00-16h30 to pick up your tickets (for the 19h00 show), go back to the South Point to freshen up and make it back to the strip, you might have a surprise. Because of the heavy traffic and the time it takes to make it to the venue, park, queue up for the tickets and finally have them in hand, you realize you\u2019ll have no time to go back to the South Point, shower, drink a bit and come back.

This trip was my first visit to South Point, and the hotel room was free before I arrived. So I can't comment on the room rates. Location (poor). This is a locals hotel and casino. Yes, it is on the strip, but many miles south of Madalay Bay and the rest of the strip hotels and casinos. If you are planning to visit the \"real\" strip or downtown you will need a rental car. The good news is that cheap rental cars are easy to get in LV. The hotel is supposed to have a shuttle, but I didn't try it. I just rented a cheap car. Room (very good). Enough room and nicely appointed. I don't spend much time in my room (other than shower and sleep) when in LV. Maid service did a good job and everything appeared to be in working order. One very big negative is the internet (see below). Temperature controls were quiet. That's a big plus for me since I'm a light sleeper. Internet access (very bad). Like a lot of hotels SP is trying to grossly overcharge customers for internet access. Only the hotel's hotspots can be found on this property. Some center strip hotels you can access hotspots outside your hotel, but not at SP. Both the wifi and wired connections are unbelievably expensive. Stay away from it. I'd drive down the street to a Starbucks or McDonalds and use their wifi service instead. Gambling (good). I didn't see anything to call overwhelmingly great or terrible. Note, many LV casinos have significantly worsened their rules in recent years. In fact, LV is no longer my favorite destination for solely gambling purposes because so many places have worsened their rules. SP is ok. SP's cage and club are much too slow. I saw 2 hour lines that the player's club. Food (fair). Quality was good in the buffet and ok in the cafe. Prices were too high in my opinion. My meals were paid for, but I don't know if I'd go there without the comps. Atmosphere (cowboy). You'll swear your in the old west. A high percentage of the patrons walk around with cowboy hats, fig leaf sized belt buckles, boots and jeans. If you like red necks and cowboys, you'll love it. Note, they have many rodeo and similarly related events in the arena here. Family (fair). I don't like kids in a casino. Like too many LV locations you can't get anyplace without going through the middle of the casino floor: front desk, parking garage, room access, restaurants, everything goes through the casino. After going through the casino floor you can access the arena, movie theaters, bowling lanes. There are things for families to do here. But I don't like that the kids and strollers have to go through the middle of the casino all the time. Smoke (bad). Like a lot of casinos the smoke handling is rather poor. I'm surprised because a newer location like SP should have built in better smoke handling. On a Saturday night, it's bad. Parking (good). Easy access to LV Blvd (many miles south of the real strip), to I-15. Quick and easy getting to and from the airport. Much easier than center strip locations.

Coffee table along with the table and chairs by the window in their picture didn't exist.. Since we rarely spend much time in the room, it really didn't matter to us, but this is a LV first for us, a partially furnished room. The sheets and pillowcases were tattered, and the 42\" tv was mounted crooked on the wall. The bathroom was large but only had a single sink. The closet with a safe was nice (but we didn't sit in the closet or watch the safe). Went to Don Vitos at 8;30 (opens at 5) which wasn't busy (I later would know why) and were told they ran out of lasagne. Probably the busiest period in LV and they run out of lasagne in their Italian restaurant. Explain that. Service was terrible and phony. Waited about 10 minutes after salad for main course (I upgraded the salad to a Caesar for $1 as their menu suggested. The salad I got was the same as a regular, no additional items in it). Waiter suggested an alternative to the lasagne which I took, with regret expressed. The pasta had the texture of beef jerky, and the sauce and italian sausage tasted acidic. The waiter came by and asked if everything was good, to which I said 'no'. Without breaking stride he patted me on the back and said 'atta-boy'. Needless to say, little of this dish was eaten. When resaurant management was made aware of the food quality and service, their solution was 'come back and we'll comp the meal'. Like we would ever eat there again. That night, I got very sick, unable to even leave the room til 2pm the next day. Gee, wonder what caused that? The room's temperature was fine, but the rest of the property was terribly hot. Patrons, as well as staff, complained of this throughout our duration there. It was uncomfortable, and coupled with the worst drink service we have ever seen in LV, it wasn't fun to game. In 25+ hours of gaming, I was offered 5 drinks. Maybe the beverages were being shipped in with the lasagne. Ashtrays in the casino were rarely emptied, and empty glasses rarely picked up (although, there weren't many of those around as drinks were rarely offered). Bingo parlor was nice, big easy to read number boards. But the NY Eve bingo session wasn't a lot of fun. 600 people jammed in there, in the heat, for 4 1/2 hours. (There was one break). We drove, so we weren't stranded there. With no shuttle being offered anymore to the strip, your stuck (unless you pay $$$$ for a cab or opt for what looks like a long bus trip).

The Hotel was large with plenty of free parking ,it also had a very efficient valet check in service which we used as it was raining and cold ! Check in was very quick and the check in clerk very helpful in telling us about the facilities and how to get to the strip which is another story . The rooms we had were on a non smoking floor and cost us $107.90 for 2 nights INCLUDING 2 garden buffets ,free fitness center entry and 4 free cocktails . This is a promotion South Point Run and the offer code is BBFAVPKG. We had a super king bed in a spacious room that was all you would expect of a 3 to 4 star hotel . Had to say even tho i am not big at 190lbs the towels were tiny and made me think we had stumbled on a small persons bathroom ! One thing about Vegas that bugs us is how people smoke in just about every space , even the elevator ! Jerks... The food was nothing to write home about and we only ate at the Garden Buffet once and went out to eat . Since South Point is out of Las Vegas you can either drive in or catch the Shuttle to the Mandalay Bay . It takes 15-20 minutes dependant on traffic and was a pain in the butt . We are going to Vegas in Jan 09 and will stay nearer to the Strip at the Hilton .

Great view looking north across the city toward the strip. Upon entering room I was very impressed. Clean!! Large flat panel on the wall. Bed was very comfy with like 5 large pillows on the bed. Large clean bathroom stocked with Bath & Body Works products. If you like to talk on the phone while in the bathroom you can do it here. Casino has many slots, table games, video poker, a sports book, race book for parimutual races. I found the buffet to be reasonably priced and quite tasty. Prime rib on Wednesday was $15. Included an Asian station, seafood, mexican, bbq, italian, salad bar, dessert bar. Service was friendly and attentive. Hotel has several other restaurants, bars, gift shop, business center, movie theatre, arcade for the kids. I ordered room service once and it came in about 30 minutes. A little pricey but very good. I played slots and had good luck on the penny machines. Hotel was built in 2005 and is in very good condition. Housekeeping took good care of me and kept me in towels, made the bed and left bath products. About 4 miles south of the strip but an easy, quick drive if you have a car.

This event took place Oct. 2-6, 2008 and every single guest who stayed at the Southpoint enjoyed the facility.

(I was last there in July '08, and I'll be there again at the end of December '08.) I've stayed at many of Vegas's storied Strip hotels, from the Venetian to THEHotel and most of the big places in between, but for most of my frequent visits to Sin City, SP has become my hotel of choice. Why? My reasons are pretty much the same as those of my fellow TA reviewers: SP's excellent rooms, very low prices, and high standards of comfort and cleanliness. True, the hotel is only 3 years old, but it still seems brand new, no mean feat given its huge size and, er, less than high-end clientele. If you want glitz, glamour, and high prices, dozens of Vegas hotels can meet those desires. If, however, you want a spacious, very comfortable room that's quiet, relaxing, and well equipped, surf the web for SP's best room rates. (Hint: they're not usually found on the hotel's own web site, although SP promises to match any bonafide rate you find elsewhere; I had them make good on that promise once, and SP matched the rate I found on Expedia.) I've never paid more than $50 a night. At that rate, SP is a true Vegas bargain. A bit more on the rooms: at a minimum, you'll get a large room with a king or queen bed, a huge (42\") plasma TV, and a great bathroom with the best amenities I've encountered in a Vegas hotel: Bath & Body Works Coconut and Lime products -- they smell good enough to eat! The higher-floor rooms have great views over Vegas, the mountains, and/or the desert; SP's cottoned to the appeal of the higher-floor rooms and recently introduced a three-tier price scheme for its basic (\"Deluxe\") rooms, charging more for \"mid\" and \"higher\" floors. Again, I recommend booking via a website other than the hotel's and then making your room request once you arrive; I've had good results doing so. SP's location is also, at least for me, a strong point. It's a few miles south of -- but only a few minutes by car via either LV Boulevard or I-15 from -- the Strip, and it's very easy to access and park at the hotel, something you can't say for most of the Strip properties. Unlike most huge Vegas hotels, SP has no discernible theme: it's bland, but in a pleasant, welcoming way; and I find the decor a welcome relief after dining and gambling at the sequined palaces on the Strip. SP's casino is airy and bright, and while it has as many smokers as any other big casino in Vegas, it seems less smoky. Even when crowded, there always seems to be enough space between you and all of the other gamblers and blinking machines. In short, SP deserves its hundreds of rave reviews and high ranking on TA. Give it a try, and I bet you'll appreciate your time on the Strip more by staying at South Point.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cloved it\u201d", "Author": "catch2222", "ReviewID": "UR22356914", "Content": "Ok, so this is my second review now.

I would recommend doing it this way if you've never been it gives the opportunity to see the adjacent hotels and you don't feel like you're going too far from your hotel. Ok, now for the review. We arrived 3 hours early with the intention of gambling for a bit and then checking in. When we got to the desk checking in that early was NO problem. The counter staff was very nice and helpful. Make sure when you check in you get the coupon book for the hotel there are some great values in it. I think we used almost every coupon in the 3 days we stayed there, everything from buffet coupons, to bowling coupons. When we got up to the room we were amazed at the size and cleanliness of the room. We had a non smoking room, and to our surprise it didn't smell of smoke like the rest seem to. We had everything we needed in the room, a nice TV, a nice shower, and really nice beds. The view was not all that great as we were able to look at the building right beside, and nothing else but who goes to look out the window right? The pool and hot tub are just beautiful. Unfortunately they close at 5 pm so if you want to go for a swim make sure it's early. There were always clean towels out there, and I even felt safe leaving my stuff on a chair when I went to swim. The Casino is quite large and offered a nice variety of games. The service was really fast in the casino as well. Your drink was still cold when they got it to you. The gambling was good as well, some win some lose, I won I'm not saying millions, but I won enough to keep me in the casino and having a good time. The food choices are good, we ate the buffet which was probably the best we had all week in Vegas as far as selection and quality goes. We also ate at the deli, with a coupon from check in. Upon looking at the menu, it seems over priced but it's really not, the portions are just huge. We also did the bowling which was a lot of fun. With the coupon from check in 2 of us bowled 3 games for 13 dollars including shoe rental.

Our visit was nice and comfortable but there were some issues with the hotel, mainly with customer service. Hotel: The hotel is family friendly and nice looking, but don\u2019t expect the extravagant look of other Vegas hotels. It is new and absolutely okay-looking, but the d\u00e9cor is plain. The reason we chose it was the children\u2019s entertainment. They have a movie theatre, bowling and arcade. The arcade was lots of fun for the kids, but we never got to bowl \u2013 the wait on a Saturday night was about 90 minutes. The casino, pool and gift shop were good. Rooms: The rooms were clean and comfortable, and to our surprise, very spacious. That was good because the kids didn\u2019t feel too crowded. I agree with another reviewer \u2013 the towels were too small/thin, but the sheets were especially soft and luxurious. However, the furniture and d\u00e9cor were very plain and simple. We didn\u2019t care because we traveled with friends and were more interested in the company than in a fancy look. Restaurants: The first night we ate at Coronado Caf\u00e9. It was a disaster. Out of 11 entrees, only one was edible. Most of us didn\u2019t touch the food, which was cold and tasteless. The dishes didn\u2019t arrive together, the service was extremely slow and sloppy, and the waiters hardly understood English. They even forgot some of the items we ordered, which wasn\u2019t a big loss anyway. Prices were cheap, but what good is it if you can\u2019t eat your food? Don\u2019t waste your time there. In the morning we ate at Garden Buffet. That was a much better experience than the night before. For breakfast, it\u2019s completely okay, and not expensive. The selection was rich and food was good+. They have different sections (Mexican, Italian, American, Asian, etc.), and everybody can find something to eat - absolutely recommended for breakfast. Service was better than at the caf\u00e9. Then at night we ate at Primarily Prime Rib. It was nice. The only problem was that they couldn\u2019t accommodate such large group as ours (24 people), so we had to sit in two separate tables, but it was worth it. Although we experienced better food at other fine dining restaurants, this one had absolutely great food for the prices. The portions were big and the wine was good, the selection was average, and the food was good++, but not extraordinary or unique. However, no one was disappointed. The service was wonderful and extra quick, and the waiters were super nice. When my husband asked for jalapeno, which they didn\u2019t have, they ran to the restaurant next door to get him some. If you don\u2019t want to leave the hotel or spend big bucks at the other hotels, Prime Rib is totally acceptable for a nice dinner. Customer service: This is where the hotel needs the most improvement. Because of the size of our party, we had to make multiple phone calls/reservations. Every representative gave us different information about everything, and some were very unprofessional on the phone. They made an error and gave someone in our group the key to someone else\u2019s room. That was outrageous. Luckily, it was people who knew each other, but I\u2019ve never heard of an error like this \u2013 a stranger getting the key to your room! When the guests who originally had the room tried to get in, their key was deactivated so they were locked out. It took the front desk a long time to figure out the error and fix it, and they barely apologized for the mistake. We had to go to higher management for that. They should really train their staff better. To summarize, the hotel is nice and we recommend it, especially if you travel with kids, but keep your expectations on the low side and avoid Coronado Caf\u00e9.

The following are our observations and comments. Arrival: Shuttle was at LAS at the appointed time of 1:30pm. Our flt arrived early so we had to wait a bit, but nothing major. (will comment more on the shuttle(s) at the end of this review.) Check-in: Fast, courteous and extremely friendly. We were given a hotel map, coupon book, by a very personable woman. She gave us the feeling that she was really glad we chose South Point. (Unfortunately her name slips our minds) Room: Clean, spacious, nice view of the pool. The beds and linens were comfy. The bathroom was great, as the sink, mirror etc were separate from the toiler and bath/shower. The rooms were spotless every day. We were so impressed, we tracked down our housekeeper, and thanked her, and gave her a little extra spending money. Casino: Had most of the usual slots/games/tables as the other bigger casinos, but it was great not to have to walk too far to anything. We enjoyed ourselves, especially since we took \"their\" money home with us...woohoo. (and the cocktail waitresses are frequent) Buffets/Restaurants: We had no problem in choices of something to eat. If we found something in the buffet that was not to our liking, we simply tried another item. The deli makes a killler Pastrami sandwich, big enough for two. Also, the 75 cent hotdogs on Sunday football was a nice treat, with a cold beer. No complaints in the food department. Bowling Alley/Theatres: We had a look, but did not use. We both thought it would have been nice to have something like this when our kids were younger, so that they could cut loose on their own for a while. There were alot of kids there, but they were having a good time. Pool Area: We lay outside for a couple of hours, as the weather was nice. The pool area is nicely laid out, and the big whirlpool jetted spa was really relaxing. A couple of comments: 1. Alot has been mentioned in the reviews about the Shuttle service. We reserved the \"Airport\" shuttle 24 hours in advance for our pick-up. No problems. The same again for the return to the airport. This shuttle drops/pick-up in the main entrance to the hotel. The \"Mandalay Bay\" shuttle runs approximately on the hour from South Point. This shuttle leaves from the north side of the casino. Depending on traffic, it was no real problem. (note: according to the Mandalay Bay shuttle driver, this service will end December 14th.) We feel that the hotel should keep it, as its a nice selling point to be able to hop aboard and then catch the tram to the Excalibur. There are taxis, but they are gonna cost you about $45 return. 2. Smokey Casino. Much more than the casino at the Mandalay Bay. We attributed this to the casino being packed both Saturday and Sunday night. Maybe their system cannot keep up, but if you are a non-smoker you will notice. 3.Internet is not free. It will cost you approx $12 for 24 hours, but we looked around at a couple of other hotels and this seems to be the norm. Again it would be a nice selling point, if they didn't charge or gave you an hour free a day, or something like that. Overall we had a good time. We both agreed that the staff at this hotel was one of the more accomodating and friendly that we have dealt with in sometime.

The bathroom was large with a separate room for the toilet and shower/tub. A nice plus when travelling with family. The pool area is large and well laid out. The buffet restaurant was fine enough. Not spectacular, but still okay. We enjoyed the bowling as we never did this as a family beforehand though it was quite pricey. I did enjoy the casino experience as well. The down sides: 1) I was very surprised that any extra guests above the first two in a room, over the age of 5 , are charged as additional \"adult\" guests. I have never experienced this low a cut off in age and I have stayed at Westins, Ritz Carltons, Fairmonts etc. 2) My children were charged the full adult fare at the buffets. How much can my 8 and 11 year olds eat? 3) There is an extra fee to use the gym. I understand that the hotel wants everyone at the tables rather than the gym but still. 4) Internet charges.

Overall the stay was fine, and the impression I got was that the South Point was attempting to be a \"value\" resort like the ones on the strip, but for a much lower room rate, and slightly lower ameneties. Here are some specifics I noticed. Positives: \u2022 Very reasonable rates for a LV Strip style mega-casino/hotel. My room averaged $100/night over 4 nights. \u2022 Like the Strip hotels, there are many entertainment and dining options on-site, and of course a full casino. All three, however, are slightly limited compared to the on-the-Strip mega-hotels. There are bowling lanes and a full movie theater, a live entertainment theater and an equestrian/rodeo/dirt bike venue in the building. Negatives: \u2022 The South Point aims to compete with the Strip mega-hotels, but their d\u00e9cor and style are a little bland (which could be refreshing in Vegas). They have no theme, and while everything is clean and modern enough, it lack character, which is what Vegas is famous for. \u2022 The South Point is not on the Las Vegas Strip, and is actually further than it seems to be. A free shuttle is provided from the South Point to the Strip and to the Airport, but it is not as convenient as it should be to encourage more people to stay at this fine hotel otherwise. The shuttles to the Strip actually only run to the Mandalay Bay resort, the southernmost point on the Strip, from where transportation needs to be arranged to any other point on the Strip. The shuttles do not run very frequently (about once every 25 minutes, I think), and the last one back to the hotel is at 1am \u2013 which is not particularly late for Las Vegas. I would suggest that they run multiple shuttles at the same time, and stop at 3 locations on the Strip or so, and keep running until about 3am \u2013 at least on Friday and Saturday. The free airport shuttle requires reservations beforehand, and also runs infrequently. (Also note that this shuttle does not leave from the \u201cShuttle Stand\u201d, which I found out is only for the Strip Shuttle, after I almost missed the airport shuttle, which leaves from the front of the hotel.) \u2022 I did not see a prominent concierge desk at this hotel as I have at other LV hotels. Perhaps I missed it, or the front desk can provide similar services, but considering how busy the front desk is, a dedicated concierge is a necessity in Las Vegas, where so many people need assistance with reservations, activities, and transportation (especially being far from the action). \u2022 Exorbitant rates for internet access. I believe it was roughly $12 per day. I was traveling on business and needed access to my email, so I signed up regardless. My company paid, but I felt like I was robbed. I went to the Business Center to see if I could use their printer to print out my boarding pass, and found that I had to pay for a minimum of 1 hour of computer time, plus some amount for each page printed. Unfortunately, I think this is common to many of the hotels on/near the LV Strip \u2013 it was at the hotel I stayed on the Strip last year. \u2022 While I am sure that watching TV is not a common pastime in Vegas, I find it puzzling that the South Point TV does not offer even all of the basic cable channels, let alone HBO, Showtime, etc. Most people won\u2019t care about the TV, I guess, but if it is to be a premiere hotel, they should at least try to match the Red Roof Inn\u2019s selection.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat property!

The coupon books they hand out upon check-in saved me at least $25 over the course of my stay. When not doing conference related activities, I enjoyed the bowling alley, sports book and gaming.

I never seemed to wait more than 10 seconds for an elevator. Overall, I thought the food was good (both the buffet and the food served at the conference), but for a special night out something on the strip is still the best bet.

The bathroom was large and everything was decorated very nicely. I liked that the hallways were well lit and they have security officers at night checking for room keys before you can get on the elevators. The casino did seem a little smokier than normal but I think that is because there seemed to be a huge number of smokers compared to other casinos we visited. Very rarely could I sit at a machine without someone next to me lighting up. I didn't have this problem at the other casinos. I guess we just visited on a weekend with lots of smokers (I don't smoke, so I am very sensitive to it). The casino had a huge number of very fun penny slots. I like the penny slots because you can bet from 1 cent to $2.10 depending on your whim. I actually won some money this trip and there was a huge variety of machines to play on. The casino had a very fun vibe and everyone seemed to be relaxed and having a good time. The tables games were always pretty full and we were having fun with the slots so we didn't partake. We did play bingo in a really nice bingo hall and had a good time. We didn't visit the pool, bowling alley, or theatre, so I can't comment. We ate at Baja Miguels, which I didn't like the food at all, but my husband did. We ate at the buffet once and the coffee shop once. The food and service at both was good. My husband hung out at the casino bar while my girlfriend and I gambled and he had a great time with the bartenders who he said were very friendly and personable.

How's that for service and sense of welcome! Unlike the other hotels on the Strip, Southpoint was much better laid out, and the whole place seemed to be more spacious. I very much liked the decor, and the yellow/orangey lighting made the place brighter and more cheerful compared to the \"ever nightime\" feeling I got in the other Strip hotels. The room itself was superbly maintained. I wouldn't have thought that I'd got this room for the money that I'd paid. As for the casino itself, the games were pretty much standard, though I find the variety quite limited, albeit from an Asian perspective. Would prefer more dice games. The multi-storey car park was well within reach of the main building and lift lobby to the rooms, and there was plenty of parking space. Unless you are here to soak in the Strip atmosphere, the Southpoint is an oasis from the hustle and bustle of activities. It is a good place to relax by the pool, enjoy a few rounds at the tables, before taking up the option of hitting the Strip at night, an easy 10min drive northwards along Las Vegas Boulevard.

If you've ever stayed at The Orleans, you will know what to expect, as it is very similar, and used to be part of the same group. I'd score it higher than The Orleans on having a very straightforward layout, and, in particular, a much less smoky casino. I'd perhaps score it lower on the buffet, which I could only describe as average. I sampled a few other of the food places and found them all to be of good quality at very reasonable prices. There is a free shuttle to the airport and also to The Mandalay Bay, on The Strip. They don't really advertise The Strip shuttle and you have to find the casino entrance by the parking garage for the pick up point, but it did run every 30 minutes and was only about a ten minute ride. The temperature was in the mid nineties so I really enjoyed relaxing by the pool every day. Nothing fancy but very pleasant, clean and well maintained. The room itself was great. Very comfortable king size bed, nice bathroom, very quiet but efficient air conditioning and perfectly cleaned by the room staff every day. 42\" TV on the wall was good for watching the Baseball Playoffs (shame it wasn't in HD though). The only downer on the room (5th floor) was that my \"view\" was the wall of another building, so perhaps you should mention that when you book, if you do want to see something/anything out the window. The casino was well laid out with a good selection of games. I stick to slots and video poker and ended up spending only half my budget. It's worth joining The Players Club as I got back over $120 by the end of my week. A few reviews have mentioned poor service, but I can honestly say that I had no problem at all with any of the staff. They all seemed friendly and efficient. In general the place appears to be well run. The first half of the week there were mostly middle aged and elderly visitors with some families and children. Later in the week there was a Native American rodeo event at the equestrian centre. As a Brit I found this most interesting as many of them wore Cowboy hats (not like in those old movies) and also spoke in their own languages. As far as I could see, everyone from whatever background got on very well together, and had a good time in the nice relaxed atmosphere in the casino.

There are 2 trams. The inside one stops at the Luxor before heading on to Excalibur, while the outside one goes direct. Once outside off of the tram, you are a short walk to New York, New York, MGM Grand, and a few blocks away from Planet Hollywood, Paris, Ballys, Bellagio and Caesars. For an adventure, hop on the Deuce (double decker bus) on the strip, and take it up to the Fremont area. You won't be disappointed (make sure you hang around in the evening for the Fremont street experience). The Deuce bus ride is $2 one way or $5 for an all day pass.

We chose this hotel for the value and because we were going to rent a couple of cars for the group it was not an issue that we were 5 miles south of the Strip. This ended up being a very good choice and not 1 in our group had a complaint. It was nice to get back to the hotel at 1 or 2 in the morning and find a quieter place to sit down and get a drink. The big hotels on the strip were packed at that time and also the drink prices were double if not more. The room we had was on the 5th floor with a view of a brick wall. Other than that, it was well appointed and roomy. We tried the buffet and the cafe for breakfast, we went to the cafe for one dinner and also to the prime rib restaurant one night. All three places were great food at a great price. The Deli was also a hit for the lunch or late night snack. The location of this hotel is a little far from the action, so unless you plan on renting a car, or cabbing it back into town, there is not much else in the area outher than the outlet mall. Cars are cheap to rent from the airport and parking is plentifull and free in every casino so it was no big deal to drive to the strip and park and walk to a few casinos then move to the next block whenever you pleased and walk some more. The pool area was large enough and not crowded at all when we were there. The movie theatres are large and the selection of movies was like any large city and the bowling lanes were busy but there was always something available. I did not check out the equestrian portion so I have no comment. The only disappointing amenity I can think of is that the gym cost $20 but who needs excercise when you are walking all day long. A tip for everyone....when you check in they give you a coupon book....use it. There is a 2 for 1 for the breakfast buffet, if you are there on the weekend use it on one of those days because it doubles in price to $14. There are many other discount coupons to use within the hotel property so if you plan on eating and drinking there they will come in handy. The whole group of us went to see \"O\" by cirque de soleil and it was awsome. The girls had tickets to Cher one night but she cancelled and the guys went one night to Criss Angel Beleive but it was horrible and there were dozens of people walking out of the show before it was over so stay away from that one.

The South Point hotel/casino was much nicer than I expected and the room was a pleasant surprise. I had requested a King Smoking but they only had Queen Smoking when I checked in. Since it was just myself in the room I didn't really care and had decided that if I didn't like the room that I'd check later on to see if a King Smoking had opened up. As it was the room was just fine and I didn't change. For a smoking room it didn't have that stale, old cigarette smell that most do. Air conditioner was awesome and got the room really nice and \"cold\". The flat screen TV was huge and it was a nice touch that they had a coffee/tea machine in bathroom. Most Vegas hotels don't offer that any longer. And the best thing about the rooms is the in-room safe at no charge! I locked up all my valuables, dvd player and money each time I left the room and was able to do so with complete peace of mind. Absolutely the best feature of the room. The casino was very comfortable and I was estatic to see $1 minimum roulette!! It was a casino that I felt completely comfortable and safe on my own in. My only complaint is that the roulette dealers weren't very personable - would it hurt them to smile or crack a joke?? Needless to say I only leave a tip for the dealers if I have a pleasant experience and part of that experience is the attitude of the dealers. If it seems like it's a chore for them to have me at their table then it's a chore for me to leave them a little something something. Oh, and what's up with having beads hanging at the table, I assume to give to players to make them feel welcome, and not giving them out? I actually had someone who must work at the casino who was on their day off come up and play at the roulette table I was on and jokingly gave the pit boss a hard time about handing out some beads- then and only then- was I given some beads. Granted this seems like a stupid and petty complaint but it all adds to the fun & atmosphere of the casino. Didn't eat at any of the resturants so I can't comment on them. The Seattle Coffee Company was wonderful in the morning and the people working there were always happy with smiles on their faces. A real treat when trying to face the morning- kudos to the Seattle Coffee Company baristas! Pool area was small but pleasant. The astroturf was hotter than the concrete so don't fool yourself thinking you can walk on the fake grass without sandles! I can only imagine how crowded it was during the summer and with the 800 hotel rooms being added that is only going to add to the crowding at the pool. Overall I have to say the hotel & casino was very pleasant but without a rental car (which I did have) it would have been a real pain to wait on and take shuttles to and from the Strip and a real expense to take taxis. I'd definately stay here again IF there was no other option or if finances were tight but I'm a \"Strip\" kinda girl and would much rather be closer to the glitz and lights!

It was very nice. That's the nicest thing I can say about the whole South Point experience. The staff was incredibly rude and unwilling to take any responsibility for the services they provide. The shuttles do not run on the hour, so you can find yourself sitting at the pick up or drop off points for more than 30 minutes. If you're expecting to catch the last shuttle back from the strip at midnight, BEWARE! You must make sure you're standing in the correct location at Mandalay Bay, because the staff at Mandalay isn't familiar with the Share Point shuttle pick up location. There is seating room only on the shuttle, so if you're not willing to shove your way through the crowd, you may have spent your time waiting for nothing. They WILL kick you off and with no apologies or other options whatsoever. We ended up taking cabs nearly every night due to some awful experience with the shuttle. As I said, the hotel takes no responsibility for any issues with the shuttle. The shuttle service is contracted out the Bel Trans, and even though South Point's name is ALL over the bus, they could care less how rude the service was. If you're planning on taking the shuttle to the airport, have a back up plan. Again, this shuttle does not run on the hour and according to the hotel, you need to make reservations for the shuttle to the airport. This was not something the hotel made us aware of upon checking in. The security in the hotel is extremely rude, and inconsistent. We were only allowed 2 room keys, even though there were 3 of us staying there. Well, security chooses to do their job when it's convenient for them and requests to see your room key before entering the elevator area. If you're without a room key, they will make you show proof that you're staying there. This only happened maybe 2 times during our entire stay so be prepared for inconsistency. The vending machines for sodas do not have sodas in them, so be prepared to spend upwards of $4.00 per soda. The food is mediocre, so your best bet is going someplace else. The hotel is FILLED with cigerette smoke, so if you're sensitive to this, stay somewhere is. Overall, it was not a good experience...

Let\u2019s start with the good stuff. The rate was about $75, which was quite a bit lower than the major hotels on the Strip (for the days we were there). The room that we had was very spacious and very modern. The AC worked well and was very quiet. The bathroom had a separate section for the toilet and shower and the room had a full size couch next to the king-sized bed. Another great thing that you will not find in the mega-hotels on the Strip is that you can park your car right in front of the main entrance. (There is also a parking garage but we never had to go there.) With respect to the location, the South Point advertises that they are 7 minutes from the Strip\u2026. You will need in fact about 10 minutes to get to the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign at the beginning of the Strip but you must then budget another 10-15 minutes minimum to get your car parked in any one of the major mega-complex of the Strip. One way to shorten this a bit is take the truck road right after the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign. You will avoid all the traffic lights of the Strip. The South Point offers a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay resort but, again, this is the very first complex of the Strip and there will be a lot of walking to do if you intend to visit the other complexes further north. The disappointing points were as follows. On a nice Sunday afternoon with 108 degrees outside, the pool was closed for some \u201cspecial event\u201d\u2026.we were glad we were not traveling with kids\u2026 Also, beware of the extras. The WI-FI is $12.00 per day and the gym (which seemed quite nice) is a whoppy $15 per day (based on another experience, this is not uncommon in Las Vegas\u2026) Finally, we had a booklet in the rooms with a set of coupons. The booklet included a 2 for 1 coupon for the breakfast buffet, which is pretty good (but definitely not as good as the buffets on the major hotels on the strip).

She said that the room I has was the only room left, it was supposedly non-smoking, and then offered to send house keeping to \"spray something\" if I wanted. I told her that it smelled bad enough without then having to breathe more chemicals,etc. and that I wouldn't be staying there ever again. She said \"fine\". I won't be going back.

The rooms are clean, huge, and you get a nice big tv. The bathrooms come stocked with Bath and Body Works products which I love. My only gripe this trip was the maid service. When we arrived at midnight, our room door was open and we didn't have any soap or shampoo and conditioner. Our floor obviously hadn't been vacuumed since there were some sort of crumbs by the couch...but at midnight and after a full day of work and a 4 hour drive to Vegas, we just didn't care to make the effort to call the front desk. The next day when the maids came our room still wasn't vacuumed and they still didn't leave us soap or anything else. We aren't too high maintenance so it wasn't a big deal but it's still annoying. The drinks are cheap, 3 bucks at the bars. The buffet was the worst buffet I have ever been to and even with our coupon for a free buffet I wanted my six bucks back. I felt robbed.

The hotel is moderate. The pictures make it look like a glitzy modern hotel however its more like a standard Comfort/ Holiday Inn. The casino and pool are quite crowded tough to find a seat at the gaming tables. Seems to be filled with tourists and a large number of locals. We stayed in a King Room which was quite spacious but who needs tons of space when you are only in a room to sleep. Sleeping on the otherhand was quite an experience. The mattress is covered in some sort of plastic mat so everytime you move it crackles not mention it does not allow for ventilation. Making sleeping quite uncomfortable. The room was clean the hallways however leading to the room the carpet was filthy. Several stains throughout. There are several different options for dining we tried the Buffet for breakfast which was average and the Mexican Restaurant which was very good. The pool is nice but don't expect to relax. There was an unusually large amount of children for a Vegas hotel. The hotel allows floats so if you just want to take a dip to cool off its tough to find a spot to get in avoiding all of the pool games going on with the children. Aside from that they also allow guests to bring coolers to the pool so there is a large amount of trash and beer cans all around the pool. The Spa looks very modern although we were not interested in paying an extra $20 per day for use of the gym. We paid $89 per night for our room which is not bad but when you can get a room on the strip for the same amount or a couple dollars more I will stay on the strip. The hotel offers a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay but expect it to take about an hour from the time you leave South Point to reach locations mid strip such as the Bellagio and about 30 minutes longer to get to The Wynn. I would reccommend not staying here if you do not have a car and plan on doing anything on the strip. Overall if you want a bargain trip this is the place to stay just don't expect it to be anymore than a bargain.

Some of the amenities that normally are free are fee based at this hotel. Those amenities are not deal breakers though. For example the gym and internet are fee based. I normally skip workouts on vacation, but I did miss the internet a little. This place is massive with more amenities than the average hotel. My nine year old compared it to a mall and I agree. We were lucky to be the first to stay in a new wing that just opened two days before we arrived. The room was brand new. The rooms are very large with Thomasville furnishings and granite counter tops in the bathrooms. The room also has a 42\u201d LCD TV. The beds were a little too soft. The room being new had a minor problem. One of the walls did not have power and the engineers could not find the breaker when the outage was reported. The hotel immediately offered to send their staff to move us, but it was not a big deal to us. They fixed the problem the following day while we were out. The entire hotel also had a water outage that day, which was a big deal because it wasted some of our day, but that was fixed as well.

This hotel is waaaaaay off the strip, but tries to make up for that by having everything right there inside the hotel. We parked ourselves in the garage, and check-in was easy (although, hard to find, as in Las Vegas every hotel makes you walk through the entire casino before checking in or going to the garage). I asked for a room on a high floor away from the elevators, and we had a really quiet room on the 24th floor. This hotel is newish (2005) so everything is still fairly clean and modern. The room was surprisingly big. Two comfie queen beds, a sitting area, huge windows overlooking vegas, and a huge bathroom and separate toilet/shower area. Even the coffee maker was modern. There was extra room for us to open all of our luggage on the floor. Really nice, large flat screen tv. Bath & bodyworks lotion/shampoo (Coconut Lime Verbena--our favorite) was a nice touch. The casino takes up most of the first floor, amongst some restaurants and bars. The food was so-so, but we expected that. When we checked in we were given a coupon booklet--lots of free stuff, so we ate at the breakfast buffet, two of us, for 6 bucks. Has a huge movie theater (16 screens?) and nice bowling alley. Lots of stuff for the kids to do while mommy goes and gambles for a couple of hours. The pool area was big, full of kids and semi-drunk adults. Pool water looked filmy and cloudy, so, I didn't swim too long. They have shuttles if you want to go to the strip, but we didn't venture, as we were there just long enough to eat, sleep, watch a movie, etc. Overall, this was a great value. It's a good place for a family to stay for a couple of days, or for those with time to spend at the hotel and venture to the strip (it's probably a good 3 miles).", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Cloud, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, great value at The South Point\u201d", "Author": "ImPops", "ReviewID": "UR18446561", "Content": "Wife and I stayed at The South Point for two nights, starting on July 27. It was great. We were on the 21st floor, room 2154. It was the perfect place to celebrate my wife's birthday! Security was at the elevators every evening and checked room keys. There was lots of security in and around the hotel, on foot, in cars and on bikes. We felt very safe even at night in the parking garage. The casino was not too smoky. Check in went smoothly. The girl that checked us in, Nicole, was very friendly and helpful and saw that we had a non smoking room on a high floor, facing the hills, just like we requested. We checked in about 1pm and even though check in is not until 3pm they had no problem letting us check in two hours early. The room was VERY comfortable. We had a king size bed that was very firm but plush and the sheets were great. The pillows were very comfortable. There was triple sheeting on the bed. The blackout curtains worked very well and kept the room absolutely dark, great the next morning after a late night when we wanted to sleep in. We didn't hear a sound from outside the room, not once while we were there. Air conditioning worked great and was very quiet. The hotel supplied soap, shampoo and shower gel from Bath and Body Works and the wife just loved that. We even had a bottle of mouthwash! The lighting was good in the room and so was the water pressure. Wireless internet worked great from the room when we purchased it for one day. There is a huge safe that you can set your own code for. It held our 15 in and 17 inch widescreen laptops and my wife's large purse and there was still room left! There is an ironing board and iron in the room, and a couch and coffee table, as well as a small dining table with two chairs. It was like a mini suite. I see that some reviews mentioned power and water problems earlier this month, but apparently that has been fixed. Our water pressure was great the entire time, and our lights never flickered once. The 42 in plasma TV had a nice selection of channels, for Vegas, and we hooked up an S video to it one night and watched a movie using a laptop. The picture on the DVD was great too. We didn't visit the pool area this time, but could see it from our room and it looked very inviting. Next time we will visit it for sure. The buffet had a great selection for lunch and we had a buy one get one free coupon given to us at check in. It was a great value at $7.99. We ate dinner in the Coronado Cafe one night. Wife had the T bone special and I had the rack of ribs. Both meals were very good. The graveyard specials were good too, and very reasonable. We don't gamble much, we do more sight seeing while we are in Vegas, but we did play the slots a little one night, and they were pretty loose for us. We came home ahead. The waitress came by frequently asking if we wanted something to drink. Every employee we met on the casino floor was friendly to us, whether we were gambling at the time or just observing or looking around. We didn't meet any employees that were rude or unfriendly during our stay. We liked that the South Point is a little ways from the strip.

I found the South Point thru TA, and it sure paid off for us. We are not gamblers, so I can not report what the gaming was like, but there was a TON of activity in the casino every night, so some were enjoying it. We had just a run-of-the-mill non-smoking, king, but the room was fantastic. Very clean, bed was awesome (I stay in hotels probably 150 nights a year, so the bed is a big deal for me), and we had a sixth floor room overlooking the pool, so the view was great. The maid service was tremendous, room was always clean and fresh, and we never heard , saw or smelled anything \"untoward\" our whole stay. We only ate in one of the restaurants in the hotel during our stay (we drove out this time, so we had a car, which gave us freedom to hit some places we normally don't get to), but the one we did eat in, the steakhouse, was phenomenal. Everyone enjoyed their meals, and the service was perfect. If the other restaurants in the hotel are equal to this one, they all would be great places to eat and based upon the lines to get into them, they must be close). The only complaint I had (and it's minor) was the service from the bartenders at the many bars around the hotel. Getting a drink from any of the male bartenders was a chore, they were much more interested in attending to the cocktail waitresses needs than those sitting at a bar, or at one of the tables in one of the bar areas. While the cocktail waitresses were well worth watching, it is a little irritating to have to virtually reach out and grab a bartender in order to pay him $8.00 for a drink. Didn't have this problem with the female bartenders (bartendresses???), they were right there as soon as you sat down, and the service from them was on par with the rest of the South Point---impeccable.

Didn't care for the chinese food but I am comparing it to NYC Chinatown. Baja Miguel's - Not bad. Was better then some of the chain restaurants (Chevy's, On the Border). Big Sur Oyster Bar - Good. Crispy fried Calamari & chunky New England Clam Chowder. Casino: We lost but that's why they call it gambling. The drink hostesses were great, always coming around/fast service + cold beer. Overall the casino was clean and not very smokey. Check-Out: Waited in line for a couple of minutes. The only issue I had was a $15 per day charge for a room refrigerator. This was dropped b/c it was required for medical/medicine. I checked on this before I checked in but was something missed by the front desk, no biggie! Tips: 1. If you have a car and are heading to the strip use the I-15 entrance at the back of hotel. You can fly up the highway and get off at many spots along the strip. Time & gas saver. 2. They sell liquor in the gift store in the casino. 3. Graveyard specials @ Coronado's from 12:00 - 6:00am. Several dishes are $3 - $5. Things I would change: 1. $10 a day fee to use the gym 2. $12 a day for internet access 3.

The hotel is about 2 years old and the property is in good shape. Although advertised as \u201caffordable luxury\u201d (with the rooms at $53 it is definitely affordable), this is a 3 star resort and definitely lacks the charm of many of the strip properties.

So, this year we decided to stay off the strip as we always rent a car so that was not a problem. SP does have shuttles to the strip and airport. Check in was a breeze and we were given a coupon book plus we got extra points at the slot club since both our birthdays were in April and we stayed there during our birthday month. Plus they had a members promotion going on one day and we got 2 T-shirts and a nice Thermos set. The staff were extremely friendly and service oriented. We checked in early and they put us in a room away from the construction. Not much of a view but the room was quiet and like new with a large, flat screen TV. Another nice feature was that the bathtub/shower and toilet are in a separate room from the vanity/sink area so we could both get ready at the same time. The only negative was that the pool was closed due to the construction but it is supposed to be open for the summer. We used a coupon from the book for a 2 for 1 breakfast buffet which was good. We also shared a huge sandwich at the Deli one day which was very good. They also had gigantic pastries. The dinner buffet was just average. One morning we had breakfast in the Del Mar Cafe which was also very good. They also have a Steakhouse and Mexican restaurant which we never got to try. The Sports Book had 75 cent Vienna hot dogs. There are numerous bars with nightly entertainment. We had originally planned to go to the Bill Medley/Paul Revere and the Raiders show but had a change in plans. The casino has ample slot machines and tables with low limits. Quite a few times the whole place would be humming when we walked in from the parking garage and we would just have to stop and play and it paid off nicely a few times.

We travel on a budget and don't have 5 star hotel experiences to compare this to. We only ask two things of a hotel/motel. 1) It's clean. No bugs, rodents or creepy crawlers in the room. 2) It's safe and secure. We can lay our heads down on our pillows and not feel like we have to sleep with one eye open. We bring our own pillows from home and always bring a safety door look no matter where we are traveling. The South Point was the last stop on a 6 day road trip. This is a nice place to stay. As soon as we pulled up a bellman came out to get our luggage, and a valet was there to park our car. After days of unpacking and repacking and driving this was very nice. We did have a small problem on check-in. We had booked with Hotels.com yet the hotel did not have our reservation. This wasn't that big of a deal and was quickly corrected. Our room was large and comfortable. By far the best room we had during our trip. The beds were comfy, and the pillows nice and thick. The shower head was one of those \"rain\" type shower heads. I don't like these. By the time the water reaches my head it's a trickle. It makes it hard to get all the shampoo out of my hair. There was a large 42' plasma screen TV in the room. My kids loved this. As a horse racing fan I was quite pleased to see that we got TVG in our room. There was a single cup coffee maker in the room. Unfortunately they don't give you enough coffee. A call to housekeeping quickly resolved this. The shower and toilet are in a seperate area from the sink and vanity. This is nice when more then one person needs to get ready to go out. You have to pay for Wi-fi. $11.99 for 24 hours of Internet service. I didn't like this. I feel it should be free. Of course our lap top BSOD'ed and that was $11.99 down the tubes. I did like that there was plenty of light available in this room. Our last two rooms had very low lighting, so this was a nice change. There weren't many eating options in this hotel. I've stayed at other off-the-strip hotels in the past that had more choices in food. That said, the \"Del Mar Deli\" made a pretty good pizza, and a fabulous Black Forest Cake. The Garden Buffet served a really good breakfast. By far the best buffet food we had all week. The South Point is currently under construction. Except for the pool not being available this was not an issue. They have a bowling alley which would have been nice to use, expect that the one night we had available to bowl there was no open bowling. I was a bit chagrined by this. The South Point is off the strip, closer to Henderson, but it's an easy drive down Las Vegas Blvd to the strip. The hotel does offer a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay, but we found it very easy to drive. We were there mid-week so traffic and parking were easy enough. As for the people who complained about the smoke....come on folks it's Las Vegas. What did you expect. Yes the casinos are smokey, but it isn't that bad. I have asthma and I was o.k. I can remember being in Vegas as a kid (about 30+ years ago) and it was awful then. The smoke was so thick you could see it hanging in the air. They do allow smoking in the casinos, but they don't allow smoking near the eating establishments in the casinos.

After reading reviews I was also apprehensive about the smoke at South Point, but decided to book anyhow. We are very happy that we did! By late-afternoon the smoke in the casino was strong, and you do have to go through the casino to get to a lot of things. The only place that smoking is allowed at South Point is in the casino (like most hotels). This hotel makes a great effort to rid the smoke in the casino. Every morning the casino smelled fresh and clean, so we did our gambling at South Point early in the morning. There was not a scent of smoke in the guest rooms, cinemas, equestrian arena, bowling alley or restaurants. South Point is continuously cleaning (including carpets via a zamboni) and it shows. Our room was spotless, large and comfortable. Of all the restaurants that we ate at in Las Vegas, we agreed that the Silverado Steak House at South Point was our favorite overall for quality of food, wait staff, and atmosphere. There was a horse show during our stay that drew a lot of cowboy/girl guests. They were a very nice crowd of people...I can think of a lot of worse groups to occupy a hotel with! There was a scent of horse/cattle the nearer you were to the arena, but coming from a rural area ourselves, it did not bother us. It was obvious to us that the staff at South Point was happy; they were very friendly, smiling and helpful throughout our stay. Everyday that we spent at this hotel made us like it even more. We visited the big name hotels (Bellagio, Ceasars, Venetian & Palazzo) during our trip and they are more glamorus than South Point. But, don't get me wrong, South Point has some very tastefully and expensively decorated areas (some of the restaurants, guestrooms, spa, fitness center, convention center), but people stay at South Point for different reasons than the Bellagio's of the world. For $200 less per night than the high rent hotels, this is a bargain. The hotel is undergoing construction which caused some minor early morning disturbance, but not intolerable. We rented a car which worked very well for us to travel to the strip. Finding parking was never a problem at the hotel or on the strip.

I just love this Hotel. I don't know why people keep on complaining about how far it is off the strip. Yes it is far but before I book a hotel, I always check out where it is located and since almost everybody has internet it should not be a problem anymore to see how far it is off the strip. If you have a car it really is no problem at all to get to the strip. The freeway ramp is next to the hotel and if you know where you want to got on the strip you just take that exit. If you plan on cruising the strip you will have a problem no matter where you stay even if you stay on the strip because the traffic is awful. We just park our car somewhere on the strip and then walk the strip. The next problem people keep complaining about is the shuttle. It is only logical that the shuttle can never be on time since there is so much traffic. So if you don't mind waiting for a shuttle or spending 20$ for a cab or you have your own car than this is the perfect hotel. Then people keep on complaining about the smoke. I'm a non-smoker(used to smoke) and I can't say that the casino is that smoky, everywhere where there is a big room (orleans, palace station etc.)and a lot of people smoke it allways looks smokier than in a casino with a lot of walls and corners. (Mirage, Excal. etc). What i like about the south point is that the rooms are still pretty new and clean. I dont have to worry about walking barefoot on the carpet becaus there are some discusting stains or sleeping on a bed where there are sheets with little holes or stains. (Not yet anyway) Hope it stays that way. The price is also great for what you get. When we were there in september they were already having construction, we were up on the 17th floor facing the construction and the pool and the beautiful mountains. I am also a pretty light sleeper but i did not here anything from the construction. It is true that you probably dont spend that much time in your room except for sleeping but if i dont have a good night sleep because i have to worry about discusting stains or bugs or something like that, than my day and my mood won' t be as good. I'd rather stay a little OFF the strip (with a car)in a super nice clean room, than on the strip for a little or a lot more expensive room that might not be as new and clean and comfortable. So, I hope this review helps some people to make there decision.", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Il", "Title": "\u201cGreat spa, good hotel\u201d", "Author": "kbankatt", "ReviewID": "UR13907996", "Content": "The Hotel is lovely, very clean and busy. Eat somewhere else. The bueffet breakfast at the Garde Cafe` was mediocre at best. I had a very bad and expensive chicken sandwich at the deli $11.00 for sandwich, fries and soda. I did not eat at the hotel again during my stay. The staff at the front desk and bell station were polite, but not friendly. The house keepers and spa personnel were friendly and welcoming. The spa was excellent. Make sure you book before you go. If you wait you may not be able to get an appointment. I had the hot stone message with reflexology and aromatherapy and topped it off with a caba san foot treatment. I thought the spa prices were reasonable. There was a fee ($15.00 a day or 3 days for $39.00) for use of the fitness center, but it was well worth it as it also provided access to the spa facilities, i.e. sauna, steam, cooling pool, hot tub and more. Spa day was the best day at the hotel. The hotel shuttle which was supposed to run every half an hour was too unpredictable and more than once I waited more than 45 minutes for the shuttle. Additionally, though the strip is always up. The shuttle stops running at 1:00am. There is no convenient public transportation to and from the hotel. Although it is possible to take the Deuce and CAT from the strip to South Point make sure you have plenty of time and patience. The public bus stops running at 12:30am. A cab from the strip (Mandalay Bay) to South Point is no less than $20.00 w/o tip and typically about $24.00. Because of the inefficiency of other modes of transportation, you will probably wind up taking a cab on more than one occasion. The standard room with double bed was spacious and comfortable, not spectacular. Overall, I enjoyed my stay.

We drove down from Alberta, so being off the Strip was not a problem. In many reviews, people complain about it taking forever to get to the Strip hotels - maybe next time, check where the hotel is on a map before you go! Yes, it is about a $20 taxi ride to the Strip. Either rent a car, shell out the cash, or catch the shuttle (we never did - I can't tell you what that's like). Anyways, we were very happy with just about everything at the hotel. The casino and restaurants are very similar to most of the hotels in Vegas. The casino smells like smoke, but most of Las Vegas smells like smoke so we didn't worry about it too much. We checked in rather quickly, and our room was fantastic for the price. Nice big bathroom, lovely big bed, and plenty of space to spread out. No complaints at all. If I had to find something bad to say, it would be that the food was perhaps a bit sub-par. The breakfast buffet is good value, but don't expect gourmet fare. In general, the buffet and cafe food are like diner food. A lot of fried items, but generally we were able to find something to eat. Room service was expensive but still good. We ended up eating at the little Deli and coffee shop more than the restaurants. The spa was fantastic! They really treat you well, and the amenities are really lovely. I loved the cascading showers. If you have time, book a treatment and enjoy the facilities (including pool, hot tub, fabulous showers, exercise equipment, etc). In the end, I am glad we stayed at South Point. The rate was very reasonable (about $100 US/night) and we didn't have any major problems. If you want to be on the Strip and receive 5-star service, go stay at one of the the big hotels the strip and pay $500 a night.

Tub was nice with a wide ledge for toiletries and a rain shower-head.

It is a good 15-20 minutes from the strip(on the free-way). It is really far south. To go out to shows or sight seeing on the strip was either an expensive taxi ride ($30) or waiting for the bright blue South Point shuttle. My husband was attending meeting there and, even though free shuttle is provided, had to plan to leave in plenty of time to wait for shuttle and then the drive. It took us an hour to get to the Rio for a show (shuttle to Mandalay Bay and then taxi line and taxi to Rio). Luckily we left enough time to eat, but ended up settling for fast Chinese at the Rio instead of a nicer restaurant there. I have to say I did appreciate that there was security at elevator bay (night only) and you had to show your hotel key to enter the elevator bays. Again, if you are traveling with teens, this is a good choice. The rooms are huge but offer no mini bar or refrigerator. Our view was of a wall, granted a pretty yellow wall, but a wall nonetheless. The bed was amazing! The linens were high quality and the mattress was perhaps the best hotel mattress I've slept on. Room was clean but furniture cheap and starting to show wear already. Every room has flat screen on the wall. Bathroom also quite big, clean and nicely decorated. However, the towels were Motel 6 size and quality. Small and scratchy. I was surprised the lines were such different quality. If I had to choose, I'm glad they splurged on the bedding and saved on the towels. We ate at the Cafe in South Point twice. Once upon our arrival, we were tired and hungry, and then the next day for breakfast. Our dinner food was good but service was awful. Our breakfast service was better but the food was awful. How could bacon and eggs be awful, you ask. I don't know but it was! My bacon was just pure grease and no taste though my eggs were OK. My husband had the South Point special and said the sausage was like chopped up hot dog. He barely touched it. If I were traveling with children under 21, I would stay there again because it is so far from the strip, the security, and the bowling alley. If I wanted to go to Vegas to shop and rented a car, I might stay there again. There is a nice bowling alley there and I guess pool and movie theater though we never checked that out. Service was mixed. When we asked how to get to the cafe the first two people we stopped didn't even know!! One bus driver was quiet and somewhat surly, another friendly and helpful. The valet was super!! He showed us how to get where we were going (Hoover Dam) on the map answered lots of questions. One waitress never came back to check on us, another brought things we didn't even ask for. I thought the casino was one of the smokiest ones we went to. We are 50 years old and were on the young side of the average crowd, except for the several high school soccer teams staying there. I have to add the room was very quiet. There was absolutely no hall noise once inside your room. Even with high school soccer team on same floor. Several business associates also chose to stay there (same meeting) and several of them thought it was great. They liked staying off strip and having such big rooms and nearby shopping.

The buffet was very nice for both breakfast and dinner, and the casino held a nice variety of games with good paybacks. The problem was transportation. The South Point runs a shuttle to the south end of Mandalay Bay, but the service was sporadic at best. I waited a half hour on the evening I checked in before the shuttle arrived. The next morning, after 45 minutes, I gave up and paid the Vegas trolley for the same trip.

The spa facilites were wonderful....beautiful lounge areas and plenty of space. My husband and I both had Swedish massages. They were fine; not spectacular, but good. They do charge you a $15 fee per day to use the fitness center and spa. If you are having a service that day, though, it is free. We ate at Baja Miguel's when we first arrived. The taco salads were great and service was friendly and efficient. We ate at Don Vito's, which was also very good. They bring you warm bread with a relish that is absolutely fantastic. Very reasonable prices. We also ate at the buffet for breakfast and lunch, both had a large selection of food. The Coronado Cafe looks very basic, with a no-theme menu. I ordered the filet mignon with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. The Professional Bull Riding Competition was there the same weekend we were, but the hotel did not feel overcrowded....they handled the group very well with no sacrifice of service for the rest of us. One other thing that impressed us was the gift shop prices. Although some of their souviniers were expensive, it was nice to not pay $3.50 for a bottlle of water. Their drink and snack prices were very comparable to what you would pay at a 7-11.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Check-in was quick and efficient, the hotel clerk very helpful with my questions. Compared to other hotels, our distance from the entry to the hotel to our room was not overwhelming. Valet parking is available, and we always used it. They were very quick on retrieving our car at all times. There are also heaters outside while waiting for your vehicle. Our room was lovely. We had a very spacious bathroom, with a separate area containing the shower/tub and toilet. There is a phone in the bathroom, if needed. All tile and wallcoverings were appropriate for a bathroom. The sink area is large, with lots of counter space. There is a coffee pot/hair dryer/ice bucket/glasses located here. Plenty of thick, white towels. The entry to our room widened upon entering the door, where you can store your luggage, or put the items you will need each day for your adventures, and are out of the way as needed. There is a full length mirror here also. The closet has an ironing board/ iron and safe. Several hangers, though they could use more of them. A large shelf that goes the entire length of the closet, as well as one luggage rack. Plenty of floor space for a couple suitcases in the closet. The room has a very comfortable bed, several pillows, a pull-out couch, coffee table, wonderful flat screen TV mounted on the wall, 6 drawer dresser, desk and chair, and a table with 2 chairs. Two phones are in the room, one on the nightstand, and one on the desk. One large window. A nightstand on each side of the bed. I found the colors soothing, all various shades of yellow. The lighting was excellent. All things important to me worked: lights, locks, water pressure, plugs, TV remote, phone etc.! The heating worked very well, and we adjusted it several times. Housekeeping was left a tip every day and our room was spotless each day we returned. The hotel has a very nice, almost smoke free casino. Seems to have a lot of local business. Nice variety of restaurants. A huge bowling alley, though we did not partake. Theater. Equestrian Center, though no events were in progress while we visited. The hotel does have a decent store, but was the only shopping venue. We used the business center to print our boarding passes ($1.00 a page) and they were quick and efficient. Check-out was also a breeze, and they gave me an added discount I was not expecting. Overall, the hotel is an excellent choice if you want to stay off-Strip. You will need a vehicle if you want easy access to the Strip and other tourist areas. Takes about 10 minutes to reach the Strip. We appreciated the quiet of the hotel (floor 21-away from the construction), and there are many conveniences located directly around the hotel-gas stations, convenience stores, outlet mall etc. I highly recommend the South Point Hotel.", "Date": "January 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sledgey", "ReviewID": "UR12794448", "Content": "Very good hotel.

My emails to reservations were returned within minutes. Check-in and check out were quick. The prices in the liquor/gift shop were very competitive.

We booked the king room through Expedia and requested a high floor with a nice view, along with a rollaway bed and a mini-fridge for meds, as suggested on TA. The cost was just over $1000 for the 3 of us for 10 nights which we though was very good value. After a long day of travelling from Edinburgh via Newark with Continental (approximately $1000 each) and missing a set of golf clubs, we picked up our hire car from Dollar, a Chrysler Pacifica 4lt (approximately $500), and arrived at South Point late afternoon. The drive from the car rental pick-up was easy and took no more than 15 minutes (probably less). Check-in was no problem. They had the room we requested ready for us along with the rollaway bed and fridge. We paid extra for the additional adult in the room at the time of booking with Expedia, and then paid extra for the rollaway bed at check-out. We were given our book of vouchers at check-in and used amny during our stay. Within 2 minutes of arriving in our room, the rollaway bed and fridge followed. Golf clubs arrived from Continental the next day!! Our room was on the 17th floor with a view out over the pool towards the western mountains, beautiful at sunset. As has been said already, the rooms are very big and well thought out with a nice changing area, large TV, very comfy bed, couch, coffee table, table and chairs, desk, chest of drawers, good sized wardrobe, iron/ironing board, electronic safe, vanity area in bathroom and separate W/C and bath/shower. Good quality toiletries are provided. Towels could have been larger and softer but were plentiful. There is also a one cup tea/coffee maker on the vanity top. I like my cups of tea in the morning and at bed time so we bought a kettle and some larger mugs at the Outlets, then left them for the maid when we left. If we looked out the window to the right we could see the new wing being built, but it did not bother us at all, except for the pool being closed on the 1st November. We did manage to use the pool once and the spa/hot tub part was superb. I'm sure it will all be very nice again once construction is finished. We used the buffet each morning and found it very good value with an outstanding selection of foods. We also used the buffet most nights as well and really enjoyed the speciality nights of steak, prime rib and seafood. The buffet area is a bit open and does not have a lot of ambience but is nice and bright all the same. All the staff were very friendly and service was quick and efficient. Went to the steak house one night and had a nice meal, but nothing special. Used the coffee shop at 6am to get drinks and pastries before going off to golf. The hotel shop was well stocked and had a liquor store as well, with very good prices. Great choice of clothes and gifts as well. There was show jumping on in the Equestrian Centre while we were there so we watched a few rounds, which was great for a horse nut like myself. We used our vouchers for the bowling alley and had a great time. We did play a few slots but do not know much about gambling so cannot comment on payouts. Our friends won about $250 on the slots one night, so were quite pleased. The casino looked brighter than most we visited on the strip and was certainly a lot less smokey. There seemed to be lots of slots and tables. The drinks service was very efficient. We were a bit disappointed to find that the gym was not included in the room price, but was $15 per person per day extra. As we were staying for 10 days and there were 3 of us, that was going to be $450 extra, so we did not bother, which as a pity as we had intended to work-out each day to try to combat the food consumption!! South Point is in a great position for exploring the Las Vegas area with a hire car. The ramp to the interstate is right beside the hotel. It was very easy to get to the strip, either using Las Vegas Blvd, I15 or our preferred option, Dean Martin Dr. It was also easy to get east of the airport using Warm Springs Road and Eastern Avenue. Went hiking up on Mount Charleston which was so beautiful and peaceful and such a contrast from LV. Had a great lunch in the Ski Lodge on Halloween and all the staff were in costumes. They were all so helpful and lunch was so nice that we will go back there again some day. Also went hiking in the Red Rock Canyon, again a beautiful and interesting area, and saw the mountain sheep. Had late lunch at the Silverton buffet on the way back and liked the choice. The buffet area was nicer and more intimate than South Point but was much smaller. The choice of food was very good. The casino area was very dark. Loved the Pro bass Shop. Also went to Grand Canyon West to walk on the glass bridge. What an experience, I was terrified. But the trip was well worth the drive and we found the whole set up very well done and good value. Buses take you around to all the view points and sites. Our main reason for going to LV this time as the PBR World Finals at the Thomas & Mack Centre. We had booked our seats months in advance through Alliance Tickets/VegasTickets.com and had a great view of both sets of chutes from the end of the arena. The finals were superb, but over too quick for us. A big extra for us was the fact that an episode of CSI was being filmed alongside the PBR finals and we saw Grissom and Brass!! We booked Blue Man Group and Spamalot online before we left and had good seats for both. We really enjoyed the shows, but especially loved the Monty Python spoof (although it seemed that a lot of our US friends did not get the jokes). Had the buffet in the Wynn before the show which was really great with a huge selection. Just found the staff to be very aloof and not that helpful. Also had the lunch buffet at TI one day because we were hungry and happened to be passing. Nice selection of food, just a bit noisy with too many kids for my liking. As usual we went to Strip a few times and walked through all the hotels and shops. Fashion Show Mall is great as is the new one at PH. Loved The Forum at Caesars Palace and also the shops at the Venetian. Found a Zappos on Dean Martin just north of Silverton and got some great shoe deals there. We went to the LV outlets a few times which was not very far away from South Point. Prices were very good for us Brits so we bought lots. The guys played golf at Desert Pines and Royal Links and really enjoyed the courses. I had booked online in advance using our Walters Golf preferred card and got good rates. We also used the driving range at Desert Pines one day as well. Did the Heli USA night flight over the strip on the last evening which was great. We booked online in advance. Pick up was from Mandalay Bay and this was our only small niggle as they would not valet park at the main entrance, which was very difficult to find, as we were not guests. We then had to go round to the back to the West entrance and then navigate through the hotel to the pick-up point at the beach level doors. Went down to Fremont Street after the heli tour and enjoyed the experience, even though it was obvious that the clientele were different than at South Point and on the strip. The entertainment was great and the place was buzzing. We just felt that we had to watch our purses a bit more. So all-in-all we had a wonderful trip and would recommend South Point to anyone who hires a car and intends to do a bit more than just gamble.", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn off-strip oasis in Crazy Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "travelinpringles", "ReviewID": "UR11205003", "Content": "My partner and I stayed here for three nights on our first trip to Las Vegas in November 2007. I booked the hotel through a booking agent after reading the reviews here on Tripadvisor. The South Point is the cheapest out of the highest ranked hotels and represents the best value for money! We got a taxi from Macarran Airport which took around 15 minutes and cost around $25. Check in was great! Quick, easy and efficient staff. We were on the 23rd floor but this wasn't a problem as the hotel has several lifts. The hotel itself is immaculate, very clean and new. There are ice vending machines on each floor. Our room was enormous and spacious, with air con, a huge flat screen TV on the wall, two large double beds and an all important safe for valuables! Our room had a great view of the desert landscape and the room service menu was extensive. The hotel casino has a number of top quality restaurants including a steak house and our favourite was the 'all you can eat' buffet which served breakfast until 10am where you could have anything from cereals, eggs, waffles, pancakes etc. and for the lunch buffet a wide variety of foods: italian, seafood, salads, steaks and all for around $12 which was great value for money. Entertainment wise, the casino has an enormous bowling alley, games arcade, cinema and a luxurious health spa! I recommend the full body swedish massage!! There are also several bars open around the clock! The prices are great compared to the bars on the strip ($2.75 for a beer!) The hotel is set up so that you never want to leave! However they do offer a free shuttle bus which runs around every half hour and takes you onto the strip at the Mandalay Bay resort. Its about a 10 minute journey so its not bad at all. Vegas itself is crazy, we enjoyed wandering in and out of all the themed hotels but at the end of the day, we were glad to retreat back to The South Point for some relaxation!!

Clean, comfortable and quiet The only complaint I have is they charge $11.00 for WiFi hook up for your laptop. This was a geocaching trip, (What is geocaching? [--]) It would have been great to be able to use the laptop to log the caches we found. We ate breakfast at the buffet. When you check in you get a coupon book. There is a 2 for one coupon for the buffet. Good place for breakfast.. omelets made to order and anything else you desire for breakfast. If you get a \"Club\" card, they give you 1000 point, which equals $3.00. This can be used for food ect. Get a card and save $3.00 on the breakfast buffet. Pig out and you won't eat until dinner. LOL Also, with the \"Club\" card you get on their mailing list for \"deals\". The deal we got was $70.00 for one night, next night free. This was probalby the best deal in L.V.

When we did not feel like battling the strip traffic, we traveled via the freeway. The on ramp is RIGHT next to the hotel. Getting back and forth to a particular part of town was not a problem. MOVIES/BOWLING: My son and his friend saw a movie and then moved on to bowling. Both areas are very nice and located right next to the elevators so the kids didn't have to cut through the casino. GAMBLING: I'm not a big gambler, but my husband enjoyed playing video roulette and doubled his money UNTIL the weekend.

If you go to the South Point website, the picture of their hotel room was exactly what the room looked like, but the furniture is nicer in person. The room is large and has a coffee maker, and if you want more coffee in the morning just ask a maid. The room had a full length mirror, desk with chair, dresser and large flat screen TV and a table with 2 leather chairs. The bathroom has ceramic tiled floor (at least they appeared to be), large marble sink (at least it appeared to be) and a separate room for the tub and toilet. You also have a phone in the bathroom which I never used but I guess a nice touch. The toiletries are Bath & Body products. I just loved the bathroom. Restaurants: Buffet was very good. I ate breakfast and lunch. Lunch cost $7.95 and the menu changes often. There is a deli which is very good but expensive and a coffee and ice cream shop. The Coronado Caf\u00e9's food is tasteless.

The Bell Service was extremely helpful and friendly, very knowledgeable. The rooms are spotless, and the house cleaner service should be commended on how well they maintain the individual rooms. I cannot remember when I felt comfortable enough to walk around a hotel room bare foot. Also another note about the cleanliness of this hotel, one night after returning from an all day tour to the Grand Canyon, and nursing blisters on my feet from walking the strip prior to that trip, as I entered the lobby of the hotel, I had to remove my sneakers because my feet hurt so bad, so I walked from their front door, through their casino, through their entrance into the hotel portion, (which by the way in the evenings is manned by security and they check room keys), very secure feeling, unto the elevator to the 8th floor, down the hall to our room, and I could not believe the little, almost no dirt on my socks, that is how clean this hotel is. Very impressive! Only negative thing I could find is that due to their location you have to depend on a shuttle to get you to the strip, which eats a lot of your time, or you need to rent a car. They only have 1 shuttle to and from the Mandalay Bay, and our average wait ran between 20 to 40 minutes. Maybe adding another shuttle bus would help elevate that issue.", "Date": "October 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern CA", "Title": "\u201cNice, clean, quiet\u201d", "Author": "opieluvCA", "ReviewID": "UR10274626", "Content": "Stayed here for a bowling tournament a friend was in.

The Pros: Big room, housekeeping was great, beds extremely comfortable (best sleep we have ever had in a hotel). Good coupon book they give you at check-in. Breakfast buffet for $5.95 (including drink) can't be beat. The food of course isn't top of the line, but it was good enough and for that price you can't even get breakfast at Hardee's. The $9.95 Porterhouse steak at the Coronodo Cafe was also very good. I guess the thing that impressed us the most was how quiet the hotel was even though it was pretty crowded. We didn't have any noise problems. The cons: Even though we really enjoyed the stay, there were a couple of cons. First was the locals bringing their kids on Friday/Sat night and basically using the Ice Cream shop as a baby sitter while they gambled. We saw a couple of boys running through the casino playing football. Security needs to stop that. The pool was very nice, but cold (like most in Vegas) but the hours were too short, 10 am to 6 pm. the only other thing we didn't like (and you can't help this at any large hotel in LV) was the long walk through the casino to the hotel. One heads up. If you want a bottle of milk or a soft drink with your breakfast at the deli (not the buffet), get it at the gift shop, it will save you a little money. Something else that was nice was the fact they check your room key before letting you into the hotel elevators after 8:00 or so at night. I would also like to commend the front desk staff (Larry was his name). Check in (at 3:00 in the afternoon) took maybe 2 minutes and we got the type room we requested (up high with a view and away from the construction).

Two issues I had were that a used shower cap was left in our room hanging on the bathroom door and the wal to wall curtain in one room would not close properly due to broken hooks this let alot of unwanted light into our room early in the morning.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bothwell", "Title": "\u201cA big two thumbs up- greatv experience\u201d", "Author": "PDaddyBothwell", "ReviewID": "UR10028796", "Content": "Having been a Vegas fan for the last 15 years and having experienced the sublime to the ridiculous in terms of standards of hotel accomodation I would have to give the South Point a \"big two thumbs up\".

The quality and standard of housekeeping was very high and we found housekeeping staff to be very efficient. I would urge anyone considering a Vegas trip to think about this hotel. The only small negative is that it is south on Las vegas Boulevard away from main strip hotels. If you want to see the strip take a taxi to the Mandalay Bay and get on the free monorail which operates between this hotel and the Luxor etc and get out and walk onto strip. Alternatively take the Vegas monorail which serves some areas on and off the strip.

The location of this casino worked out great for us as we were in Vegas for a wedding in Henderson...staying 6 or so miles away from the main part of the strip helped us avoid all the traffic. We had rental cars so transportation wasn't an issue for us. *Check-in: was smooth and quick - recieved a room on the 8th floor facing the hills - front desk staff were friendly and helpful. *Rooms: Spacious and clean! We had a room with two queen size beds which were very comfortable, table with 2 chairs, dresser, closet with in room safe, iron and ironing board, 42\" Plasma TV, internet (fees apply) clock radio with IPOD docking, coffee maker and bath & body works toiletries (my favorite). *Casino: lots of slots and tables - didn't win any money, but still had fun. Never had a problem finding room to play at a table or at a machine. We enjoyed the lay-out of the casino floor as it was always easy to find the others we were traveling with. Not a huge casino. *Location: The location might not be for everyone, if you want to be within walking distance to all the other major casinos, this is not the place for you. They do provide shuttle service to the Mandalay Bay and to the airport but the last shuttle that returns from Mandalay Bay is 12:30 am and if you don't make that, you will need to take a taxi and it will cost you $20.00 to $30.00 depending on where you are on the strip. They do provide plenty of parking if you have a rental car or they have quick valet service too. *Restaurants: Many dining options are available from snacks to full gourmet. We tried the Garden Buffet for breakfast and lunch - both were good. We also ate at the Coronado Cafe, also good. The Oyster bar was the best - it seemed to be everyones favorite - clam chowder soup and crap legs were the best. We often met at Seattle's Best coffee shop for our morning or late night coffee. They also have a deli and ice cream shop and several other fine dining restaurants like, Silverado Steakhouse, Don Vitos (Italian) and Michaels...I heard great things about these three but I never had time to try them. *Construction: Yes, they are building more rooms and more restaurants - making it a bigger and better place but the only time we heard the noise was when we sat by the pool (but the weather was so cold and cloudy, which was strange for Sept., we only sat out for about an hour) - once in our room, we never heard it. We also picked this casino because we had many people with us that were in the age group of 16 to 20 so we thought they would enjoy the 64 lane bowling center and the 16 screen theatre, however, we were so busy, they never got a chance to do either...but for those traveling with children, I am sure that this is a nice added touch. I would recommend this casino to anyone interested in staying away from the crowded area of the strip - however, I am not sure if I would recommend this casino for a first time visitor - we have been to Vegas many times (20+) so staying away from all the action was a nice change for us. We had a wonderful time and the wedding, which took place at Dragon Ridge Country Club was fantastic - nothing could have been better!

When most hotels the shower is warm at best here it was as hot as you could stand. I know it is a little thing but those type of things add up. I'd put the floor of the casino similar to those in Atlantic City but not quite as cluttered. The low level limits were a welcome sight no matter what time it was. What some complained about in this hotel were its strong points to me. You didn't have the insanity of the strip itself, the congestion in trying to get anywhere. We went from South Point to Austin's steakhouse in about 15 minutes, try that from the middle of the strip! The gym had decent equipment in it, all Cybex machines which were nice to use. The only thing I could possibly say is a negative at all were the pool hours, they close the pool at 6pm, not quite sure why but I was busy golfing to really care.

First, I was really on the fence about renting a car, but I was very happy that I did. I can't comment on the shuttle since I didn't use it, but having a car gave me the freedom to be on my own schedule and there was ample and easy parking within the hotel's parking garage.

The place is very large and well appointed. I stayed in room 451 which had a window view of a wall. If a view is important, please plan accordingly and ask for something better. My main reason for writing this review is to warn people about the construction. They do not work around your sleep and will work during various times during the night. The sounds of the circular saws and hammering are deafening and you will not be able to sleep.

We had a car, so being away from the strip was not a big deal for us, plus there is a shuttle to Mandalay Bay. We checked in really late (1 am) and there was no problem with the 2 rooms we had booked. We were checked in promptly and our rooms were only 2 doors apart on the 12th floor. The elevators are directly behind the check in desk through the casino, not a far walk at all. Good security at the elevators at night, you have to show your room key to a guard to access the elevators. Rooms are fantastic, huge tv, comfortable bed, clean large bathroom, and bath and body works products in the shower, which are replensihed daily. Housekeeping was friendly and our rooms were always changed by the time we got back in the afternoon. My favorite part of the stay was the access to the pool and exercise facitlites. There is no charge to use the gym, like some other strip hotels. Plenty of exercise equipment and each station has it's own TV. The pool was also fabolous, it was open from 8am to 10pm. There is one large pool, one small pool, and a circular jazuzzi with rock waterfalls. Plenty of towels and chairs, even in the middle of the day. Food and drinks are avaiable by the pool. The only drawback was that there is construction behind the pool, so it was a bit noisy during the day. But you could not hear the contruction from inside the hotel. Only ate breakfast there, but there are many good deals. When you check in you get a coupon book, which includes a 2 for 1 buffet. Breakfst buffet was great, it was more like a brunch. There was many things including chinese food, omlete station, fruit bar, and dessert bar. The Calypso cafe also offers tremendous breakfast specials before 9am. A full breakfast for $1.95, how can you beat that. Went to Fever one night to check out the free entertainment and it was pretty good.

Going in, the place is massive. It's about 10-15 mins off the strip from Mandalay Bay with nothing really around it except a nearby outlet mall. When I went to check in, there were 3 attendants, and 12 stations. Needless to say, there was a huge line, and a wait over 15 mins. No apology was given, which was disapointing. Going to my room, there were A LOT of kids running around and it was not a clear path to the elevators. Once up in the hallway, the place starts to shine a bit. Very nice decor and quiet. The room itself is very nice and big. 42\" LCD on the wall, many lights and a huge VERY comfortable bed. If anyone's read my reviews before, you know that if everything else fails, if the bed is confortable, It's at least a decent stay. Well, bed was fantastic. The hotel has a lot of resturants, but only a few are worth the trip. Don Vitto's is the best of them, and a very nice intimate dinning expiereince. Michael's is a very high-end place, with great food. The Silverado Steakhouse is nice too. Everything else is not good. Service is slow, and food is VERY basic and bland. Pool is nice, but the hours change daily as they have a lot of events, so it's not even worth it. The Spa area however is the nicest part of this hotel. If you can afford the basic message, do it, as the expirence is really 1st class. Very comfortable and relaxing enviornment, and you have to expierence it to understand. I really enjoyed that. As you can see, this hotel is up and down. The good outweighed the bad, so I give it a 3 star rating, but barely. Because this hotel is up and down, makes it irritaiting. They're trying to be something they're not, and that's a strip hotel. They're trying to do WAYYYY too much. There's so much open space in the casino, that you feel that it's not even done. They throw slots in the hallway towards the room elevators. They seem out of place and cheesey. It's like a cross between downtown Vegas and the strip. What they need to do is stand on their own, and focus on the good things. The demographics are all over the place. Literally all walks of life stay there. That's fine, but it brings the place down a bit when you have nice dinning places, and kids running around the vast lobby. Too much ying and yang for me. If you want to stay off the strip, give this a try. They offer shuttles to Mandalay Bay, which is nice, but I'd recommend a car. But don't go in thinking you're staying in an off-strip full on resort like a Green Valley Ranch, or Red Rocks. They're try to be like that, but they also try to be like the strip. Then they try to be like an ecconomy hotel. My advice to South Point...Pick one of those styles, and stick to it. My advice to you, the traveler, if you don't expect much, you'll like it. But it's nothing that other hotels in Vegas aren't offering.", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWould Return\u201d", "Author": "metrocard", "ReviewID": "UR8471375", "Content": "Our stay at South Point was a pleasant experience overall, and we would return.

Internet was available in-room for a fee typical of those seen in most business/conference type hotels. Make sure to ask for the fun book at check-in if you are interested in the dining and entertainment options at the property, and a preview of the coupons can be found by searching the internet. As for food, the buffet was standard fare but was neatly laid out and had enough room to move no matter how busy it became.

The free valet service was hit or miss depending on the times we needed the car, so in the future we would tip the attendant and ask them to leave the vehicle above ground for easy, quick access.

We had read the reviews on Trip Advisor prior to booking and on our arrival we were not disappointed. Check-in was easy and the staff courteous. We received a Fun Book each which contained some very useful coupons. We had a non-smoking room on the 22nd floor which was accessed by any one of six elevators. At night before gaining admission to the elevators we had to produce our room key to a security guard which was reassuring and wasn\u2019t a problem. The hallways are long so if your legs aren\u2019t what they used to be, request a room near to the elevators. Our room was nicely decorated, aired and clean. The beds were comfortable. Extra pillows were requested and supplied. In the room there was a writing table and chair, chest of drawers, round table and chairs, bedside cabinet, two telephones [cheap to use for local calls] and a clock radio. There was also a built in wardrobe containing a safe, iron and ironing board. Mounted on the wall opposite the beds was a remote controlled 42\u201d flat screen TV with enough channels to keep you satisfied. After all who comes to Las Vegas to watch TV? The Air Con was integral, quiet and controlled by a digital thermostat. There were no opening windows but the view overlooking the pool area and mountains was nice. The bathroom comprised of two rooms, one with a bath/shower and toilet, the other with a hand basin, mirror, hair dryer and coffee maker. Towels, face cloths, complimentary toiletries and coffee were changed/replaced daily if required. We sampled room service on three occasions, [all between 1.00/4.00 a.m.] and the quality and quantity was above average. Compared to London hotels, the meals and drinks served were good value for money. Heads up: A service charge has already been applied so don\u2019t feel pressured into adding extra dollars to the blank \u201ctip line\u201d when the bill is presented to you. Within the Hotel/Casino there is a 16 screen movie theatre. $7 before 6 p.m. $9 at other times. We saw four movies. There was cathedral seating with some degree of recline in all of the theatres we visited. There is also a 64 lane 10 pin bowling alley. Heads up: Retain your movie ticket stub and present it to the bowling alley sales staff and they will give you free shoe hire and a free game. It\u2019s cheap anyway particularly after midnight when games and drinks cost $1 each. The swimming pool/Jacuzzi area is a great place to unwind but watch out for the sun, 112 degrees [July]. One hour and your good to go, fried sunny side up or over easy, it\u2019s your choice. Dining: Garden Buffet, Coronado Caf\u00e9, Michaels, Don Vitos, Silverado Steak House and the Big Sur Oyster Bar. Various prices and all looked good but the smart money was on the Garden Buffet, Coronado Caf\u00e9 and the Big Sur Oyster Bar. The Garden Buffet is GutBuster heaven. All you can eat Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner for $6.95/$11.95/$12.95. Sooo much to choose from. Bring it on!! Fun Book coupons for 2 for 1 Lunch and Dinner and a coupon for a complimentary bottle of wine of your choice. Monday\u2019s were steak nights \u2013 Friday\u2019s were seafood nights. Both were $13.95. The Coronado Caf\u00e9 is good for a change. Fun Book coupons for free graveyard specials [steak & eggs, toast and jelly, drinks etc.]. If you like ice-cream, Kate\u2019s Corner ice-cream parlour is the place to be. Large tubs [menu says three scoops \u2013 more like 6+] cost $4. Of course, there are Fun Book coupons for 2 for 1 so you can really chow down and get that brain freeze going! If coffee\u2019s your thing, give the Seattle Best Coffee bar a whirl [next to Kate\u2019s ice-cream parlour]. Naturally there\u2019s a 10% off Fun Book coupon to give that cup of Joe an extra kick. As for the rest, well we never got round to them \u2013 too busy eating/drinking in other establishments along the Strip. Likewise with most of the entertainment. The South Point is a great base for your vacation and a stepping stone to days and nights of fun along the Strip and beyond. A hire car is essential [in my opinion]. The South Point had plenty of open air and multi story car parking spaces. I preferred the open air parking areas. Allowing for heavy weekend traffic I would say that it is a 10/15 minute straight drive to the south end of the strip [Mandalay Bay]. I didn\u2019t find this a problem, indeed I was glad to drive \u201chome\u201d each night to the relative calm of the South Point. There is a shuttle bus service provided by the hotel but as we had hired a car I can\u2019t comment on it\u2019s usefulness. Plus Points: Newish Hotel/Casino [opened December 2005]. Friendly staff. Nice room, comfortable beds, quiet air con, free safe, free iron/ironing board, cheap local telephone calls. Hallways were quiet at night [no noisy neighbours]. Room service OK and cheap [$48 for three meals including drinks]. Casino was well lit, tables/slots spaced nicely apart, hostess complimentary drinks service was frequent and fast. Pleasant swimming pool/Jacuzzi and surroundings. Pool party every Thursday night. Spa and Fitness centre. Buffet/Restaurants/Bars/Coffee shop/Ice-cream parlour. 16 screen movie theatre/64 lane bowling alley. Games arcade. Equestrian centre [events only \u2013 no horse riding] Gift shop. Adequate car parking facilities. Minor Minus Points: Swimming pool water temperature, too cold. Hotel hallways air temperature at night, too cold. No fridge in room \u2013 Could hire for $15 per day [too expensive in my opinion]. No guest [coin operated] laundry. Best Las Vegas Tips: Treat gambling as another form of entertainment, set a limit and stick to it. Make use of Valet parking everywhere. Zero hassle for a $2 tip. Drive around the Red Rock Canyon scenic route \u2013 17 miles west of the Strip. Drive to Mount Charleston - 35 miles northwest of the Strip \u2013 Pleasant views and 30 degrees cooler [July] than LV. Visit Hoover Dam [aim to arrive before 9.30 a.m.]. A new bridge is under construction causing long traffic queues for late risers. Take the tour. Take a lunchtime paddle steamer cruise on Lake Mead. See Hoover Dam from the waterside. Fly over the Grand Canyon [also Lake Mead and Hoover Dam] either by helicopter or twin engine plane. Take a helicopter flight over the Strip at night. Before booking attractions, check for discount coupons online. Attraction brochures/flyers containing discount coupons are available from almost anywhere along the strip and beyond. Buy designer clothes from the Premium Outlet Malls situated at the north and south ends of the Strip for the best discounts. Tipping: Some restaurants we visited incorporated a 12% service charge into the cost of their food. When presented with the bill, no separate charge for service was shown or mentioned. Always enquire if a service charge has been included before adding extra dollars to the blank \u201ctip line\u201d or leaving cash on the table. Unless you love extreme heat [100 degrees+] avoid June/July/August. Smoking: As a family of non-smokers we were concerned that smoking is permitted in some public areas in Las Vegas. Although we found no unpleasant odour in the South Point hotel hallways or the room that we were allocated, breathing in second hand smoke could be a problem in the South Point\u2019s casino and surrounding areas. We found the odour at times to be mildly unpleasant but never overpowering. Whenever we encountered areas frequented by smokers we simply moved away. It is our opinion that Las Vegas would benefit by introducing a total smoking ban in all public places as the UK and other parts of the US have already done. Verdict: We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the South Point and provided standards remain the same, would most definitely stay there again. A good honest hotel/casino that we would seriously advise you to shortlist.", "Date": "August 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel for the Money!\u201d", "Author": "Hotti35", "ReviewID": "UR8461194", "Content": "We stayed at the South Point in Las Vegas and I was pleasantly surprised by the size and cleanliness of the rooms.

We made this hotel the last stop on the return leg of a trip from Yellowstone National Park. After a week of camping, followed by driving, we were ready for a break. Our GPS needed an update as it took the long way to lead us to the South Point Hotel. We found the parking structure and made the long trek through the casino to registration. They had beads for my daughter at check-in that made the process more pleasant. They confirmed we wanted the rollaway bed I had requested and we were off across the casino again to find our room. The room was lovely. The bed was roomy and comfortable. The d\u00e9cor was modern and undamaged. We had a nice view of the pool area and the rollaway arrived promptly. The pool area was strangely empty. I sent my husband down to investigate before preparing our little one for the pool. He returned with bad news, the pool was closed because of weather. I looked at the sky and thought, \u201c what weather?\u201d The sky was mildly cloudy. I called the pool to ask if there was hope that they would open during the day. Nobody answered. I called the front desk and they called the pool and then suggested I contact the pool. I mentioned I had tried that first without an answer. They admitted nobody had answered during their call either. This was an apparent dead end. I settled in for a shower to cool my frustration. While my husband played a ridiculous game of hide and seek in the hotel room, really not that many places to hide, I had a pleasant shower. The bath products smelled nice, lemon verbena and coconut. I found three products in the shower. I tried the shampoo and body wash first. In a fit of caution I checked the last product, lotion! I realized the lotion and the conditioner had been switched and made the soggy walk to the bathroom sink in the next room to exchange products. A couple of hours later the pool opened and we released the little one from the room. She was thrilled to follow the sun patterns down the hall to the elevator and finally the pool. As the pool had been closed they were not prepared to rent their floating mats at first. The managers graciously let us use the mat anyway to my daughter and my delight. The pool area was elaborate and clean. I would have enjoyed a drink if the poolside bar had been open, alas not. The hours for the pool were longer than I had seen at other Las Vegas hotels. I think this pool was open until 10pm. I noticed that the lifeguards were purely decorative. I spent some time watching a guard turn her chair from the main pool area and speak with an off-duty guard for 10+ minutes before the other, he, wandered off. I snapped a few pictured, as I was so amazed. Finally, she returned her lackadaisical eyes toward the pool but I had no confidence in the guarding policies at this pool facility. Prior to booking our room, I had investigated the horse facility options. There were no horse shows only a belly dancing conference. My daughter is a fan of horses so I was disappointed. However, once my daughter saw the belly dancers in costume, she couldn\u2019t rest until she saw them dance. We had a pleasant dinner at the Italian Restaurant and used our coupon provided at check-in. I was surprised at how reasonable this sit-down dinner was. We followed the dinner with an evening watching the belly dancing competition. My daughter had a blast and I was happy that she was so happy. We awoke early enough to use the late-night coupons for breakfast \u2013 good until 9am. Our breakfast at another hotel restaurant was good if hurried at bit by our server\u2019s frantic pace. After breakfast, we stopped by the gift shop for our free gift and my daughter received more beads, joy! We checked out via video checkout and we on our way home. This hotel was a great value even with the pool area issues. Finally, I should say that everyone we met was very child friendly to my surprise.", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed casino, housekeeping disappointing\u201d", "Author": "mefine", "ReviewID": "UR8396183", "Content": "Usually we stay at Treasure Island but prices there were higher than my husband's employer was willing to pay. After reading positive reviews TripAdvisor and other online resources we decided to stay at South Point. When we arrived at South Point around 10:30 PM there were a few people in line at the registration desk and we had to wait about 10 minutes to register. That process went smoothly and we were given the king non-smoking with a safe that we requested. When we asked about the safe we were told that now all South Point rooms had safes as they had just finished installing the last of them that day (previously only suites had safes). We were given room 616. Upon arriving on the 6th floor if it hadn't been so late I would have turned around and left the hotel and stayed somewhere else. The hall was a mess with food wrappers, cups, \u00bd a pizza, and other trash littering the floor. It looked like the aftermath of a frat party. There were teenage boys LITERALLY hanging from the light fixtures in the hall. In the room next to ours they were having a wrestling tournament in the room with kids standing in line outside waiting to get in. When we opened the door to our room there was a maintenance cart as well as tool boxes in the room. The room was obviously not ready to be occupied. My husband called down to the front desk to get a room change. We were told there were no more king non smoking rooms and that they could put us in a queen room. My husband asked about an upgrade and was told that they had no larger rooms available. They told us that our new room would be on the 21st floor so we took our luggage up there and I sat in the chairs available outside of the elevator lobby while my husband went down to get the new keys. When my husband returned he said he had good news and bad news. The bad news was that we had to move the luggage to a new floor. The good news is that they had upgraded us to a one bedroom suite. Our suite was on the 5th floor. It was at the far end of the hall from the elevators. At the very end of the hall was a door that had two room numbers. You swiped your key card and the door opened into a small entrance way with a door on the right and left. This was the entrance to the suite. Having the extra room was very nice. We had a living area with a sofa, chair, two person dining table, and big screen TV and closet. In the closet were a very generously sized safe (large enough for a 15\" laptop), iron and ironing board. In a separate alcove off of the living room there was an office with desk, fax/copier and lots of electrical outlets. The bedroom was a separate room with a door and had a triple sheeted king size bed, dresser, chair, and the second TV. The bathroom was very large and had a separate room for the toilet, a large shower, and large soaking tub. There were multiple sets of Body Works shower gel, soap, mouth wash, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion. In fact they were very generous with this stuff and even when it wasn't used they would put a new set out so I ended up bringing home a whopping 2 pounds worth of amenities! Our room looked out over the pool. One complaint I had about the room, and it was something that would be a continuing theme through out our stay, was that housekeeping wasn't up to par. The night we checked in the sinks were not very clean. They didn't seem to vacuum outside our room very often and room service items were left in the hall for over 24 hours. Inside the room cleaning was spotty at best. They didn't seem to vacuum once in the 7 days we were there. Some days they didn't clean the bathroom counters and they didn't clean out the tub after it had been used. It was a little disappointing. I found the hotel overall to be nice. Almost everyone I dealt with was friendly and welcoming. I ate at the Coronado Cafe several times and while it seemed to take a long time for the food to come the wait staff was professional and friendly. I never ate at the Del Mar deli but the desserts there were huge and looked good. We did get ice cream several nights at Kate's Korner and found it to be very good. I really liked the fact that the pool was open until 10 PM in the evenings and that the doors to get to the pool were right next to the elevators to the hotel so it was easy to go from the room to the pool and avoid the casino. The casino was a very good experience for me. I thought the casino was generously spaced so that it was easy to maneuver around and in between tables and banks of slot machines. Drink service was very good every day I was there and I was offered a chance for a drink about every 15 minutes at a .25 Wheel of Fortune machine. In fact, I have to say that it was the best drink service I have ever seen. The casino was clean, too. Empty glasses and overflowing ashtrays were no where to be seen. Smoking was not an issue. The casino didn't really smell like smoke at all and, at least while I was playing, I was rarely bothered by anyone smoking next to me. The only downside was that the hotel was overrun with teenagers. There was a boy's basketball tournament in town and several teams must have been staying at the hotel. A lot of these kids were very tall and I am sure I saw some future NBA stars. Unfortunately it seemed like there was very little adult supervision and some of the boys seemed to be taking advantage of that. I will say that I never saw any kids in the casino. But, like boys that age seem programmed to do, they were wrestling with each other in the halls and elevators, slapping each other, running, spilling food all over, yelling, holding the elevator up, etc. I heard more than one guest comment on it. The kids were a problem at the pool as well. The pool area was fine. Certainly not as fancy as Mandalay Bay or The Mirage but it had a shallow area for tots, a secluded hot tub, and a rim around most of it so you could sit in the water. There were a lot of kids at the pool. Some were considerate and some weren't. One kid stepped on me and didn't care when we complained. The life guard was too busy flirting with a guest to pay attention to the kids. About 6 kids under 10 years old were running to the hot tub, jumping in, getting out, running to the pool, jumping in and splashing around and then repeating the process. This was not safe and was really getting annoying to both the people trying to use the hot tub and those in the pool area. Finally one gentleman got up from his lounge chair and talked sternly to the kids and they stopped until he left the pool area. I struggled with deciding to rate the hotel average or above average but decided that the good points outweighed the bad and gave it an above average rate. I would probably stay here again but maybe not during the summer when the kids are out of school.", "Date": "August 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBest gaming; Clean, spacious, contemporary rooms; Good rates!\u201d", "Author": "PleaseTakeMe2", "ReviewID": "UR8392137", "Content": "My husband and I spent 6 days at South Point Casino recently for the third year in a row. As in previous years, we enjoyed ourselves immensely. We booked directly through the hotel and got better rates than we researched online with discount accomodations web sites. Rates for gaming is probably the lowest in Las Vegas--$1 min bets for roulette and $5 blackjack. We find the rooms at South Point to be very contemporary, spacious, and clean. We enjoyed the plasma tv. Internet access is available via ethernet cable for a small daily fee w/ a credit card. Housekeeping is efficient, but a little overzealous. Be sure to put out your Do Not Disturb sign if you don't plan to leave the room before 9 am. Our housekeeper was knocking and entering each morning at 9 am until we put the Don't Disburb card in the door card slot. The hotel provides Bath & Body Works products for its guest. Don't miss the Graveyard special at the Coronado Cafe nightly after midnight for less than $2 per person (with the hotel's coupon book, you get a two for one deal)---eggs, hashbrowns, sausage or bacon, toast or pancakes. The best deal for lunch is the Garden Buffet for $7.95 for two people with the hotel's coupon book --select American favorites (steak, roast, turkey, vegies), various seafood selections, Asian, Mexican, Salads, breads, fruits, and all the dessert you can eat and free beverage refills you can drink. We tried the Deli this time around----excellent buffalo wings--20 for $10 mild or spicy. Seattle's Best Coffee is delicious and Kate's Corner is the spot for ice cream. You'll need a car if you plan to dine outside the hotel. The hotel is on the most southern end of the strip. Plenty of fast food and shopping near the hotel, but not within walking distance. The hotel provides a Free shuttle service, but you will need to reserve a space early in the day to ensure a place on the van. We had initially reserved a spot on the shuttle from the airport to the hotel, but by the tme our plane arrived and we retrievied out luggage and reached the shuttle parking (11:15 pm) the last 11 pm shuttle had departed, and believe me, it departs promptly at 11 pm. If you plan to take the public transit from the airport, it's almost impossible to figure out and takes a lot of time and money. The Deuce double-decker bus runs along the northern end of the strip and then circles back to the bus terminal; it does not go any further than the outlet plaza on the southern end of the strip, which is quite a distance from South Point Casino. A taxi for $15-$20 is the best bet. We actually took the shuttle back the the airport on the second day of our stay and rented a car through the entirety of our stay for a great rate through Thrifty. Don't miss out on the outlet mall on the north end of the strip---Premium Outlets (Exit 41B off I-15N)--all designer outlet shops, including Hilfiger, Lacoste, Liz Claiborne, Perry Ellis, Polo, Brooks Brothers, KB Toys, etc---there is a food court in the outdoor plaza. Less busy during the week days; free parking, valet for a fee. Be sure you get your hotel coupon book at check-in to enjoy the discounts for food and drinks; don't worry if you missed out on your free souvenir--for the past three years its been seashell string necklaces or mardi gras bead necklaces---good to take home to younger kids just for fun.

We were attracted to the hotel in part because of their favorable room rates. Usually when we stay in Las Vegas, we spend little time in the room and roam around town. This trip we didn't leave the property for two days. The room was spacious, clean and featured an impressive flat screen tv and Bath and Body Works soaps. The room even smelled nice - which we don't always find even in higher end properties - and the bed was very comfortable. The restaurants were good, the bingo hall had a courteous and fun staff and our visit to the spa was outstanding. We were impressed that there is a movie theatre and bowling too. All the employees we encountered seemed to really enjoy their jobs, their employer and helping guests have an enjoyable time. But we're most impressed by the fact that when we left behind our new and fairly expensive digital camera with all of our vacation photos and a wallet with many credit cards in the room they were promptly turned into security by our housekeeper Doris. We were already half way home when we discovered our mistake. When we called the hotel, they quickly transferred us to security and we were able to make arrangements to have our items returned. We stayed at Paris and the MGM on recent visits, and while this property is a 5 to 10 minute drive from all the Strip action, we think it's well worth the value and look forward to staying at South Point again.

I even booked a room there for $330-$360 per night, but then agonized over the costs and the anticipated crowds, nickel and dime charges...etc. But alas, I came to my senses with the help of reviews about the South Point. I drove to LV from SCAL and was first impressed that the hotel was just off the freeway exit...before the north bound freeway was about to back up. The valet drive up was well organized and manned. It had an upscale/grand appearance. My car and bags were quickly attended to (Thurs at about 2:00pm) There was one person in the registration line, and three counter persons. I did not wait more than 2 min. My 18th floor (smoking) room overlooked South East LV. At night, it was wonderful with all the lights from the residential homes with the mountains as a back drop. I would recommend everyone request a room on the east side. The west side faces the pool and freeway. I thought the room was gorgeous and so roomy. I had a king bed, sofa w/table plus another table with two chairs. The full length wall mirror and bathroom decor was especially nice. There were 2 sections of elevators one for the lower and one for the higher level floors, and each section had 8 banks. Never a wait for an elevator. The food at the Italian hotel restaurant was very good and the service/attention was even better. Wee bit of a irritation with the housekeeper who wanted to clean the room 10min after I checked in (huh) and then came back about 8am the next day (double huh) Someone should issue them a list of the days guest. I did not like being disturbed so early after my first night in Vegas! When I left for afternoon, I told the housekeeper working right next door that it was ok to clean the room. When I returned about 4 hours later, the room at 3:30 was untouched and this time the housekeeper was directly across the hall. She apologized profusely and immediately started cleaning my room, generously issuing me many extra favorites like shower gel and body lotion. Thin walls\u2026.its true. But none the less, I will return and will recommend this desert gem. Although I did not use the SPA I wanted to...Getting to the Strip was quick and easy from the freeway... Hotel has great covered parking and plenty of security. Oh by the way....I did not win any money in their casino, nor did I hear any bells, cheers, or screams from anyone else winning that week.

We ended up sitting in the jacuzzi for about 20 minutes, and then sitting in the kiddie pool. I know that sounds strange, but the kiddie pool had a nice \"shelf\" that you could lounge in about 8 inches of water and stay cool.

The other guests looked like everyday folks, not the tan \"hardbodies\" you encounter at some of the other resorts. We didn't feel intimidated at all.

On this trip were myself (35), my husband (35), our daughter (5) and my Mother (53). We all really enjoyed our stay here. I originally went looking online to make our reservations for this hotel. The least expensive rate I found happened to be through a \"Good Buy\" with Travelocity. But they wanted the entire payment upfront and I just was uncomfortable shelling out that money to a travel site upfront rather than the hotel itself. So I called the hotel reservations line and they were a terrific help! The gal I spoke to honored the rate I had found with Travelocity and we only had to provide the first night as deposit. Great customer service! I called back to this line a few other times to put in specific room requests and what not and always received friendly and efficient service! As you may have seen in other reviews it is best to request a room here above the 6th floor so as not to be facing a wall. We were on the 22nd floor and had a wonderful view of the pool and the mountains. If you are looking for a glimpse of the Strip you may want to request a room on the front side of the hotel. The check-in desk at this hotel is fairly non-descript and not immediately noticeable when you walk into the front door. If you aren't looking for it you may walk right by (we did just that!). As soon as you walk in make a right just past the bell desk and it's right there. Check-in was quick and easy - we did not have to re-state any of our requests and we were quickly on our way upstairs. We of course also received our coupon book at check-in. I recommend putting this straight away into whatever bag you're going to be carrying around so that you don't forget it in your room and then find yourself somewhere in the hotel where you may need to use it (which is just about everywhere). We loved our room - spacious, and with everything we needed. The beds here are the best I've slept in for as long as I can remember - just about perfect! The complimentary toiletries provided in the bathroom were from Bath & Body Works and were a good bit larger than you'd find in most hotel rooms. I think we also received mouthwash here, which was a nice perk. The shower head was quite nice as well, larger than normal and just real cozy. Sinks have granite tops and the bowl is very deep. Housekeeping provided good service all week, with the toiletries consistently replaced. One other thing we were impressed with - the coffee pot! They should all be so great :) This pot makes only one cup at a time - you put in a single pod, place your cup underneath, and out comes a piping hot cup o' joe. Quite convenient. I have seen many reviews on here containing some skepticism on the location of this hotel. I will concede that if you are relying on hotel or some other form of public transportation this location may be a little more inconvenient. However, if you are renting a vehicle (which I HIGHLY recommend when traveling to this great city), the location here is quite lovely and within a VERY reasonable distance to the strip. We never had any trouble whatsoever traveling to and from. Strip traffic can definitely be horrendous, and it always seems worse heading North (the direction you'll be traveling in from the hotel), but the traffic really does not get bad until you approach Tropicana. We really found that we enjoyed being able to escape the hectic traffic and crowds late in the evening when we were ready to settle in. We utilized Seattle's Best for coffee in the morning several times (my Mom give's it two thumbs up). The iced, blended caramel drink was quite yummy also. The buffett at this resort/casino was fair. Certainly much better can be had out here, but there is a 2for1 coupon in the coupon book and so it can be tried out for lunch quite inexpensively. The breakfast specials at the Cafe are a definite must! You cannot go wrong - just get there before 9am. The only bad thing - eating this much everyday cannot be good for us! :) We enjoyed the $1.25 special, which included eggs, meat, potato and toast. My husband also ordered the strip steak special for $2.95 a few times and was pleased with this as well. Tip: These specials are only good for those of us over the age of 21, and are not valid on weekends. In order to enjoy the greatest savings, skip the refreshments in favor of ice water, particularly juice. We found the casino here to be fairly small, and really any more smoky than any other casino. It seemed to be the most busy around very late evening (11:00ish or so). We had the best luck on the penny machines on the wall of the walkway heading back towards the rooms (right by Michaels). Our daughter decided to try out the Kidz-Place one day (coupon available). The staff were really friendly and the play area quite large. Kids can also be left money by their parents to be allowed to purchase snacks. Tips here: bring socks, or you will need to purchase them for play. Also, out of state residents will need to either have an immunization record copy with them or agree to mail or fax it in within 10 days of returning home. Anyway, our little one stayed for an hour - there weren't a whole lot of kids here during her time and she was a little bored. The lady at the front desk was great about recommending the best time to bring your children in when there would be several others for them to play with. We used the pool everyday, and had great service here as well. The pool staff were really friendly and there was never a long wait for beverages (I HIGHLY recommend the bomb pop in the collectible coconut bank!). You can get a coupon for this as well, the pool gal led us to that. The pool size is great, and the hot tub was just awesome. We loved the waterfall. Well, I could just go on and on. We really recommend a stay here. The value for the quality is just wonderful and we had no complaints.

I was amazed at the rating that this place gets on TA (4.5 is really unheard of with this many reviews) - but let me tell you it is the real deal. First and foremost, know this, the South Point is called the South Point because of its location. It is basically the southern most location on Las Vegas Blvd - EASILY 5+ miles SOUTH of Mandalay Bay and the airport. That being said - if you have a rental car - this is a great place to stay. The drive takes 7 - 10 mintues to the Strip and Valet is free everywhere so you can easily use your car for transportation. Additionally, Vegas is usually an affordable city to get rental cars in. As for the hotel - the place is amazing. The facility is 18 months old, but looks brand new. It is a large place with a big casino floor, 1300+ rooms, movie theatre, daycare, great pool, equestrian center, events center, and many dining options. My wife kept saying that you really never needed to leave South Point. The hotel is very clean, roomy, and nice. The staff are friendly and nice throughout all aspects of the property. Dining options are not great and the pricing is so-so. Daycare is affordable at $6 an hour (limit 5 hours). Overall, we really liked the South Point.

The hotel was overrun with children at all hours; obviously this hotel is a local hangout for teens. The pool was mediocre at best with no monitoring of patrons using profanity, smoking in the pool, as well as around the pool. The smoke-filled casino was smaller than most in Las Vegas and the hotel had little to offer other than a movie theatre and a bowling alley. The room was mostly quiet although slamming doors and children running up and down the hallways were disturbing.

Very clean. Rooms are very large with nice decor and a large 42\" flat screen plasma TV. Service is fast and friendly. Restaurants are plenty. Enjoyed the Coronodo Cafe for an open feel. We even went to the Century Theatre on-site to see a movie to \"cool\" down with the A/C in the early afternoon,lots of options at this great hotel. Takes about 8 minutes to get to Mandalay Bay and of course 45 minutes++ to get down the strip. My only complaint was the $15.00 charge to use the gym.

The first night there was a cocktail party around the pool celebrating the hotel's oon to open Fever nightclub.....dancers, music, lights, band. Loads of people...yet it didn't feel crowded as it is a large pool area...lots of lounge chairs and tables! I can't comment on the shuttle as we rented a car ....took about 5 minutes to get to the Mandalay Bay intersection from the hotel. There is a large outlet center fairly close to the hotel on the way to the strip. Las Vegas Blvd is always choked with traffic between Mandalay Bay and the Fashion Mall...so you should get to know the other roads (Paradise, Koval, the I-15) to avoid this area...unless of course you feel like taking a slow drive and looking at the crowds and hotels. South Point has a gorgeous outdoor hot tub/spa...it snakes it's way around a center landscaped island and is raised up a level from the pool area and ringed with lounge chairs... one of the nicest I have seen and I have stayed at many hotels (2, 3, 4 and 5 star!!) The pool is large and was always staffed by 3 lifeguards....there was waitress service (the Friday afternoon we spent at the pool there was only one girl on duty ...but she managed to get us drinks fairly quickly!!) There is also a large shallow kiddie pool.... Our room on the 4th floor....was great....good size (desk with chair and large dresser...2 chairs with a small table by the window.... Two comfy queen beds with great bedding...Great 42 \" wall mounted lcd tv. Good setup to the bathroom...Nice size tub...curved shower rod......plenty of towels, Bath and Body Works products, marble in the separate bathroom vanity area. We knew we would probably have a view of the \"wall\" that other reviewers have mentioned, since we requested a smoking room. However, it wasn't bad...the \"wall\" is another building in the complex...painted a soft yellow/ochre and situated about 25 feet away....if you stand at the window you could see the palm trees by the pool area and there was natural light coming in the window. Who stays in the room much anyway was our thinking....so no problem for us! I was also amazed at the speed of the elevators. Never waited more than a 20 second wait.... The casino is large and bright....we didn't notice a smoky smell...actually it smelled like coffee ...there was a Seattle Coffee shop opening onto the casino. The valet parking was always quick...and the employees pleasant. There is a beautiful massage spa and hair salon on the premises which we did not have time to use...maybe next time! Never made it to the bowling alley or the movie theater either! There were no equestrian events going on the weekend we were there....so we didn't get to see the \"barn\"..... We did not have time to eat at the hotel restaurants (peeked inside Michaels which looked like very plush Victorian decor).

I like the fact that this hotel/casino isn't as large as other more popular properties located in Las Vegas. We have stayed at Venetian, Monte Carlo, Luxor, MGM, Tuscany, Imperial Palace, Flamingo, and more. South Point is filled with families, young couples, people close to retirement age, and just about everyone else in between. The spa facitilites were impressive. Our package deal included the use of the spa (2 admissions) and fitness center. Great way to escape without ever leaving the hotel! The room is clean, newer looking, and comfortable. LOVED the Bath and Body Works shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower gel, and mouth wash. Sure, Las Vegas is more entertaining without kids....but sometimes leaving them behind isn't possible. So, we went to the movie theater twice during our stay. The prices are fair (movies before 6pm) and it's a great way to keep everyone entertained. Bowling center is great, too! Keep your fun book (upon check in) and get deals on dessert (buy 1 sundae, get 1 free), buffet coupon, discount on child care ($5 per hour, instead of $6). We were at South Point on 6/29 and took advantage of the movie ticket stub/buffet special. Our ticket stub got us 50% off buffet price. The buffet is very good! Something for EVERYONE. Fresh salad, soup, Mexican, Asian, seafood, Italian, BBQ, desserts! And, the hotel isn't exactly in the center of the strip action. But, I saw many people taking advantage of the casino's transportation and/or the bus (stops right at the casino). We had our own car and it was easier for me to drive the kids around town than rely on a taxi. The Venetian is a beautiful property, but you don't get the same service and/or welcome feeling there as you do at South Point. And, to me that is worth a lot when planning a vacation.

Great plasma screen TV 4. Cute coffeemaker 5. Bath and Body works products- good choice- shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, soap and mouth wash 6. effective air conditioning- a must when it was 105 degrees in Vegas! 7. Very quiet- we never once heard our neighbours Cons of the Room: 1. Could do with a fridge for drinks etc, 2. No safe- we had to lock our money and passports up in one of our suitcases. However we did see and hear them installing safes in some of the rooms near ours so this must be on the cards for all rooms soon. Pros of the Hotel: 1. Pool open between 8am and 10pm which seemed very reasonable hours 2. Casino- although we didnt use it to gamble in- it was large and spacious and very different to many casinos in Vegas that are dark and dingy looking and cramped- it was easy to get to the room via the casino but without having to trawl around every one armed bandit 3. Bowling and cinema on site was a bonus and they offer a midnight to 8am $1.00 dollar a game for bowling 4. Buffet was OK- nothing spectacular but at $6.75 for breakfast and with a buy one get one free voucher in a coupon book they give you at check in I was impressed- lovely melon, cereals and omelettes to order. 5. Lovely ice-cream parlour and again free sundae with voucher 6. Easy parking- never had a problem getting a space and lifts were efficient 7. Staff seemed friendly all around especially in the buffet Cons of the Hotel: 1. There were at times lots of children but I think this was to do with some of the conventions that they hold there. Having said that they seemed well mannered and never really bothered us! 2. The video arcade was open at strange hours- I know we are adults and not kids but we actually liked the arcade! All in all we were impressed- the area is safe, it is quick enough to drive up to the strip and extra easy for car rental return at Mccarran airport. Note: i would not recommend this hotel if you don't have a car- its too far off and who wants to wait for a shuttle service- rent a car and explore Vegas- there is more to it than just the hotels on the Strip and you are missing out if you don't head out a bit further afield!

Booked the South Point after reading Trip Advisor reviews and because of a great midweek Expedia rate of $53(\u00a328). This was a one night layover after a flight from the UK and prior to setting out next day on a round trip to Wyoming. We were aware that the hotel was a long way south of the main Las Vegas Strip area. This may be a consideration for those having a longer visit and wanting to sample life north of the Mandalay Bay. However for us the hotel was a welcome oasis after a long flight and served our purposes admirably. Check in/check out were effortless and both completed rapidly. Our 20th floor Interstate 15 side room was superb. Fittings were of a high standard; in particular the bathroom with its separate shower/toilet area had been given exceptional finishes. In our experience noise from the Interstate was fairly minimal and corridor noise virtually non-existent. The hotel offers a wide range of dining/snack facilities although we can only comment specifically on the Grand Buffet. To anyone used to UK or European prices the latter offered exceptional value and a wide range of choices. A fairly discerning palate would be required to find fault. The various activities on site bowling alley, cinema, pool etc aside from the casino offerings should be suitable for most family visits. Staff we encountered were always polite and helpful.

Wanted to book on-line but found better deals on travel sites than on south points site. I called them directly and they matched the better price. HOWABOUT $30.00 a night and I did not have to pay the web charge. (Of course the Sunday night was more $90.00 but all casinos charge more for weekends.) . We always rent a car in Vegas so the South Point was really good for us but it is 6 miles south of the Excalibur on the strip. If you don't have a car they run shuttles continously. . Parking::Easy Self parking either out front or in covered garage. Valet quite fast. Since the casino is so far off the \"strip\" proper it is not crowded at all. . The room:::Excellent, very new and clean, I particularly liked the way they did the bed covers. a comforterter sandwitched between two sheets which gets cleaned every day. I hate the old type covers which we always throw in the corner since they only get cleaned occasionally. Large room with PLASMA TV mounted on the wall, thin as a mirror. HOW COOL. . The Bathroom:::large with a separate room for the shower and toilet. Nice large sinks and they provide: Shampoo,Mouthwash,Body oil,Hair conditioner,bar soap and body wash. The coffee maker was NEAT makes one cup at a time actually brewed, not instant. Provided two cups of Regular Coffee, Two cups of Decaf, and Two cups Of Earl Grey Tea.(all at no charge) . Pool:: Very nice and clean, also have live band on Thursday night in band stand at the pool. BIG young crowd on That nite (Us oldsters did not partake of this particular venue) . Casino::Large and airy, not crowded as other Vegas casinos. Not very noisy and smokey. Table games are excellent and the dealers quite friendly. Tremendous amount of machines and since the casino is quite new they are also. All have TITO (ticket in ticket out) so you dont have to handle all that dirty money. If we did not have a convention at the Vegas Hilton we would have simply stayed in the South Point all visit. We really enjoyed the place. . The drive:: staying on the Strip and going to the Hilton on the other end of it took about 40 minutes with the traffic. The entrance to I-15 just opened behind the casino and using the interstate to Sahara Blvd. only took 15 minutes to the Hilton. . Airport rental return:: Vegas has moved ALL the rental car companies to one central place. NO rental booths are still in the terminal. You have to ride the rental car bus to this facility )10 min ride) All companies are there in one place. thats where you have to pick up your car and return it. Really quite good once you get used to it. The facility is SOUTH of the Airport and therefore Closer to the South Point than ANY OTHER CASINO ! . Food:: WE ate at the Buffet twice, Really good, Inexpensive $12.95 great food and I particularly liked the Chinese selection. (YES, I gained 5 pounds, gotta lose it before I go again !) They have a Chicago hot dog stand in the sports book with 75 cent hotdogs during the day, great lunch with SaurKraut and doesn't take much time away from the tables. . Extras:: Big horse arena which holds equestrian meets. Huge bowling alleys up stairs, REally large BINGO hall. and a Kids corral where you can leave your kids all day so long as they are Potty trained. I wouldnt want THAT job for any ammount. . Bottom Line::: We have visited VEGAS every year for the last 25 years. We usually try to stay in a different place each year. We like the South Point so well that we WILL be back there next year !! . Our choices( remember, we are 67 years old !) Number 1 is SOUTH POINT, We liked the ORLEANS untill my wife AND daughter got food poisioning in thier buffet and they simply DID NOT CARE or offer any assistance at all. WE do not like the HILTON, Too \"upper crust\" they think. raise all the table games to $15.00 or $25.00 minimum each night. Rooms just average. . hope this helped some...No spell checker on here..

The most important thing for me when staying at a hotel is to have quiet and this hotel didn't let me down. If there is ever a nuclear fallout I want the South Point to be my bunker because this place is built solid. The rooms were very quiet and amazingly enough didn't smell like smoke (big pet peeve). Also when we were in Vegas there was two days where the wind was howling so bad that the north strip was obscured by sand but in our hotel you wouldn't have known it unless you looked outside. It's that well built. We were on the 24th floor looking out over the pool. I did have three minor issues with the South Point. 1) Parking is so-so. You either park in the lot in front of the hotel where you leave your car in the hot sun or you park it in the garage where you are lucky to find a spot on the lower levels. Why do you want a lower level spot? Because from some reason there is no direct access to the hotel from the garage. You have walk down stairs or take an elevator down to the bottom floor just so you can enter through a side entrance so you can then go up to your room. It becomes a bit tedious after a while. 2. To get to your rooms you have to walk all the way through the casino regardless of where you park. And it's a long walk. I don't mind exercise but when you are lugging 4 bags and are too cheap to pay for a bellhop then the half mile walk becomes looonnngg. Even when not carrying bags it's a long walk. The biggest issue for me was having to walk through all the cigarette smoke. Even for someone like me who has minor asthma the smoke was enough to make my lungs tighten up on me. I got used to it by the end of day 2 though. 3. If you like firm noisy beds then this is your place. The beds are indeed firm, so firm that my wife and I woke up sore in the morning with neck aches...and we even brought our pillows from home. If you are traveling with a child and have to get a room with two beds be prepared to sleep like sardines. And if you have a wife like I do who can snore like a sailor when the mood strikes her you better have ear plugs. To top it off the sheets are partly made of sand paper. You think I'm joking. I'm not. It was like sleeping in burlap. After the first night I just slept on top of everything (thank goodness I'm a warm sleeper). Everytime I or my wife rolled over the sheets made a swoosh, swoosh sound, like someone too big wearing a too small pair of corduroy's. The rustling of bed sheets was so loud in our quiet room that I feared waking our daughter up in the next bed. All in all it was a pleasant experience. We ended up buying a humidifier from the local pharmacy because it was so dry in our bedrooms. It made a huge difference. So if you get a room on the 24th floor that has a humidifer in the closet you'll know where it came from. I suggest you rent a car when visiting as everything is much more spread out then you'd think. $25 a day from Budget was well worth it.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value at the South Point\u201d", "Author": "Aimster77", "ReviewID": "UR7817188", "Content": "Stayed at the Southpoint 5/31-6/3.

We checked in with two teenagers in one room and my husband and I in another. (The rooms at this hotel rank as gi-normous compared to most hotels.) Yes, you do have to have a car. Using the hotel shuttle to get to the Strip, if that is your thing, is not convenient. Bite the bullet and rent something. So give in to the fact that you are staying a bit out of town and enjoy the view of the mountains, etc. The rooms have 42' flat screen tv's and if you were wise enough to bring your portable DVD player, bingo you can hook right up. The beds were reasonable but someone with back problems might find them too soft. The pool at this place is beautiful but crowded. Lots of clean towels, a fair amount of drinks available. The bartenders inside are a bit more attentive and of course there is the ever present go-cup available for your margarita. There was a live band with a pool party while we were there. My husband is a former rock legend (well ok, of the garage band set) and he really enjoyed sitting outside watching the band. Free food and of course tickets to get in were free for the band. Speaking of food, our other Coast hotel experience gave us free breakfast every morning. A great value when feeding two children who act like they've never eaten before in their natural lives. So to the buffet it is. The buffet food is just that, some of it is OK, some of it is below par. (I wouldn't have TOUCHED those tacos, personally) but there's alot of fruit available and lots of no sugar stuff for people who can't indulge. We have visited Vegas enough with our kids that we feel a bit like locals. (We go to some of the out of the way holes in the wall to eat, where they treat us like friends. Most of the wait/serve staff in these areas are very pleasant folks which is great.) Back to the South Point (Coast)...we tried to get into the Mexican Restaurant only to endure hour long waits. B ut we were tired of the cafe food and finally got in. The food was good, the service painful to endure. The margaritas...typical watery style. Ick.

We had a cheap rate room off the inter net ($48 week day/ $99 week end) and our room even had a canopy over the bed. It had a huge picture window with a view of a wall, but the room otherwise was clsoe to twice the size of a customary room. The casino is great. Cheap early bird deals in the coffee shop $2.99 NY steak and eggs over the night until 10 am. There was a specialty coffee shop, a fine dining place, oyster bar and a buffet. There is an IHOP a mile and half up the road if youre into a traditional breakfast. This place had an awesome pool spa area. Which leads me to my only complaint. It had oddball hours. They posted a sign by the elevators daily indicating closing time. It really should be open till 10pm daily. Some nights it closed at 5pm others 7 pm.

Large health club. All the reular spa accoutriments, facials, full massage ect. Expect to pay top $$ for these. They even had a day time shoe shine stand in the casino. The gift shop had the cheapest liquor that I found anywhere in Vegas. Cheaper than even the supermarket thats about a mile down the road. There is a large movie theatre above the casio running all the newest movies. It was reasonable too. There was a full 16 lane bowling alley above the casino that had dirt cheap prices $2.90 a frame and cheap snacks for kids. There was also a day time baby sitting/ daycare for kids. $6/hr. Bingo hall as well. Heres the kicker...this place has a full indoor riding equestrian area attatched to the back of the building. WOW. I can't wait to return to Vegas. This is where I'll be staying.

But a promotion by Travelocity for the South Point caught my eye: $35 a night for the post-Memorial Day week. It had to be pre-paid with a one night penalty for cancelling, but I couldn't resist. For people driving to Las Vegas from the south, the hotel couldn't be easier to get to. It's several miles south of the airport (and hence, several miles south of the Strip) at the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd. and Silverado Ranch Blvd. Take the exit ramp, pull into the garage, and you're there. The area is under development and the I-15 / Silverado Ranch Blvd. interchange is still under construction (north bound on/off ramps only are in operation). My comments: Rooms: Clean, very large, with spacious bathrooms. My room on the 9th floor faced west overlooking the pool. I had previously read what others have said about \"the wall\" and asked when checking in for a room that didn't face \"the wall\". The person checking me in chuckled and said \"you definitely don't want to face the wall!\" Comfortable beds and, as nearly everyone mentions, 42\" plasma televisions. Casino: In stark contrast to the low ceilings and dimly lit casinos of the Strip hotels, this casino is bright and (dare I say it) cheerful. The ceiling is high giving the room an open feel. While I often feel somewhat claustrophobic in some casinos, this one feels inviting. Some reviewers have called the casino\"bland\", but I found it refreshing. There is a lot of room to move about with the slot machines surrounding the gaming tables in the center. Gaming (slots): Their club program will pay you cash for the points you earn. I think I read somewhere (but I could be wrong) that you get 1 point for every dollar you put in. I ended up with almost 6000 points (I got $17 back). Since I only had about $500 to gamble with, that $500 stretched into $6000 \"reinvested\" into the slots. Most of the slots are either penny or variable denomination (penny, nickel, quarter, dollar). The penny slots are something of a misnomer since the machines typically come with 20-30 \"lines\" on which you can bet 1 to 10 \"coins\". So if you're on a penny slot with 30 lines active and 10 coins being played, you're really betting $3 per spin. I visited four Strip casinos during my visit, dropping $20 in similar machines at each location. I found $20 at the South Point lasted about twice as long when compared to the Strip hotels. Buffet: I ate at the dinner buffet twice and the breakfast buffet once. The dinner buffet is OK, but nothing to write home about. Other hotels have much better buffets albeit at much higher prices. The breakfast buffet is the best deal in Las Vegas. At $7 it has an astounding variety of breakfast foods, all attractively presented. And from what I tasted, all very good. Pool: It seems like a large pool area, but it's illogically laid out and thus feels much smaller. It's on the west side of the building so it gets noon and afternoon sun. Other activities: I didn't check out the bowling alley or theaters. Though they have 15 or so screens at the theaters, only 5-6 films were being shown (Spiderman 3 was on 4 screens, Shrek 3 was on 4 screens, and Pirates of the Caribbean 3 was on 4 screens, with other films on the remaining.) Entertainment. The Fever nightclub was still being remodeled so wasn't open. On Thursday, Fever had an outdoor party in the pool area. I didn't attend, but could see it from my room. And I could certainly hear it. It was so loud the windows literally rattled. Fortunately, it was over by 10 PM. Parking: It's a long, very long, walk from the parking garage to the hotel. Of course you have to walk through the casino to go from the parking garage to your room and vice versa. Service: I thought most of the staff were professional and courteous, but I found the ladies hawking beverages in the casino annoying, just shy of being downright rude. Gift Shop: One of the very few hotels of any kind that has food and beverage prices in their gift shop that are actually reasonable. I paid a breathtaking $2.95 for a small bottle of water at Paris Las Vegas compared to a large bottle (I think twice the size) for $1.99 at South Point. Wine, beer, and liquor were very reasonable (about the same as you'd pay in a grocery store). Transportation: The South Point is several miles from the Strip and a car is necessary if you're going to go there. There is a hotel-supplied shuttle service, but I didn't see many people taking advantage of it. Since the I-15 northbound ramp is in operation, it's a simple matter to leave the hotel and then get off on Tropicana or any other exit along the Strip and park in one of the hotel garages there. Getting back is a bit more problematic since the southbound exit ramps are still under construction, but I never found it to be difficult in the least. Bottom line: I found the South Point to be an excellent value for Las Vegas and it far exceeded my expectations. If being on the Strip is important to you, the South Point is not your hotel. But for the cost of a single night at a Strip hotel, you could probably stay at the South Point, rent a car, pay for your meals, and still have a few dollars left over. And you'd still have a good time!", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Youngstown OH", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased with the South Point Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "OhioDiane", "ReviewID": "UR7728967", "Content": "We arrived in Las Vegas on a Saturday evening and needed a hotel to stay one night before leaving for Zion Park in Utah.

What we read on Trip Advisor had our expectations high but we never expected it to be this high. The property on most sites comes in at 3 to 3.5 stars. It should be a 4 star resort. I think just a couple things are keeping it from reaching that level and they are minimal. Robes would be nice, a safe and toiletries such as Qtips and cotton balls would bring it to that level. Check in was rather fast even with just 2 people behind the counter and 7 people in line. The wait was no more than 5-6 minutes. When we made the reservations we were told the property was full and the only rooms available were the ADA queen rooms. We accepted, but were told all would be done to accommodate our request of a king bed. The request was granted with no problem and it was a 500 sq foot room on the 11th floor facing the pool. Of course with all Las Vegas hotels the rooms are a bit of a walk, but we had no problem parking in the covered garage as it had more than plenty of room, which was nice compared to other properties that take you around and around looking for spaces in the shade. When we got to the room the floor supervisor was just re checking the room to make sure that all lights, curtains, bath products, etc\u2026 were properly displayed and in working condition. We have stayed at some of the best properties in the world and have never seen or heard of this. WOW! That was our first impression that this was a properly run hotel/spa and nothing was over looked. There was a light out in the bathroom and the supervisor asked what time would be convenient to come back to change it as they did want to bother us. The staff was so professional and pleasant it really felt like a 5 star. The room itself had plenty of room and a beautiful LG wide screen mounted T.V. All the furnishings were Thomasville. High-end quality and service. The bath products were high-end Bath and Body Works products and Koehler sinks and shower heads. Wireless Internet service (for a fee of $10.99) was excellent and the simplest we have ever connected to. There were some top end restaurants in the hotel that we did not have time to go to but did have time to visit the Garden Buffet, which was of average quality, but what do you expect for $12.95 for dinner. The choices were plentiful and the lines were short and the food fresh. The property is a perfect place to stay if your one that does not need to be in the heart of the touristy strip. If you have a car, easy to get from strip and back, only 5 miles north to it. If no car, no problem. They provide a shuttle which works perfect. Make note that the south part of the strip is growing and becoming more populated at a very fast pace especially with the new and upcoming town center shopping mall just down the street from this property. I would not hesitate or even think twice about staying at this hotel. From the comfortable Sealy bed to the quietest rooms we have ever come across. You could hear a pin drop, that is how quiet. My only suggestion is a better quality of bath towel.

This place is so great for kids (and us) we have a 3 yr old and he just loves the kids pool, the spa (hot tub) which is a really nice temp, not to hot and has little waterfalls, not to mention the large heated pool also. And they are never crowded. We booked with expedia and got the room for $38 usd per night for 2 queen beds for all 3 of us. The buffet is great, food is nice and at $13 each (no charge for the little guy) its a steal, plus you recieve a coupon book that has a 2 for 1 deal for the buffet. B/fast is $7 each. There are a bunch of other restaurants, but when you have small kids its so much easier to do the buffet thing!! The Kids Tyme club is a $6 per hour per child and they must be potty trained, but again he loves it. Its a great cheap break for us non gamblers, with the movie theatres, bowling alley, spa etc - There's no need to go anywhere else..... Its fun tho to go for a drive at night to go see the free shows at Treasure Island, the light/water/fountain show at Bellagio, the indoor rain storm inside the Alladin mall and all the sights of the strip. The rooms are lovely, big, new, and clean. My husband loves the huge plasma tv's! They also have refridgerators on request.

Ask for a room on a higher floor, though, if you want a view. We got put into a room on the second floor facing the casino wall, which extends about 5 stories.

Also we had forgotten our room keys in the room and it was very quick to get new ones. 3.Not too busy like Strip hotels - It is nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the craziness. This casino was quieter, brighter and less smoky than any we have ever stayed at. 4. The Spa and Barber Shop - This is the #1 reason I love this place. The Spa is comparable to any on the Strip. The services are extensive and not as expensive as other spas in the area. The fitness room has top of the line equipment and very large. The barber shop is run by a talented barber from upstate NY and he really knows his stuff. My husband has never looked better. I want to go back just for this. 5.

We did not eat at the restaurants at the resort as we love to go on Strip for that (Side note: Eat at David Burke's in the Venetian - Phenomenal!!!).

The pictures of the rooms are exactly what our room looked like. Very clean, spacious, plasma television, etc. We had just stayed 3 nights at the Monte Carlo and the room at the South Point was larger, cleaner, newer, nicer. I had no idea how large the place was - it has a spa, movie theatre, arcade, bowling alley, casino, and many restaurants. The restaurants all looked decent with a few nicer than others and offering a bit higher fare. We ate at an Italian place and the food was good, plentiful, and no casino noise to be had (which was amazing since it was just outside the door). I signed up for a players club card and received two free t-shirts, wine glasses, coupons for various things (free dessert at the Italian place - wonderful!). Everyone was extremely friendly. Having said all of the above, there is really only one thing you must know about the hotel - its location. It is not near the strip. This can be a benefit or drawback. I think the place is perfect for older people who do not want to go tromping around from one casino to the next and for families who are looking for something for everyone in the family to do while remaining in a centralized location. If you're going to Vegas for the first time, this probably isn't the place because you're going to want to see what everyone talks about - the great hotels, casinos, and shows that are on the strip. Last, if you do find yourself needing a last minute hotel and you've already exhausted the strip, this really does provide a great night away from the fray while still enjoying what Vegas has to offer.", "Date": "March 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, AZ", "Title": "\u201cA Great Getaway for Horse Owners!\u201d", "Author": "TucsonWorldTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR7190787", "Content": "A great place to stay and especially great for horse owners and horse admirers!

The rooms are new and spacious with beautiful horse decor, a huge plasma screen tv and I never heard noise from anyone in the halls or my neighbors. The greatest point for horse people is the quick walk to the arena to the horse show (when I was there, a million dollar cutting horse competition was going on). If you don't feel like walking to the the live action, you can watch the activity from your room on your plasma. The casino itself was great too (I did win a little) and the restaurants I ate at were as equally good. This is a kid friendly place with a movie theater, bowling alley and child care services. Nearby is the Silverton casino which was also a great atmosphere.

That alone should speak volumes since I will be attending a week long conference and I could have stayed anywhere because my company is picking up the tab.

If you like to get into the mix for a while and then want someplace to retreat to and regroup then this place is perfect. It is every bit the hotel and casino as you would find on the strip but without the hectic pace and crowds. Our tip in February was for a conference my wife was attending. We spent the weekend at South Point and then she stayed at the MGM and I crashed at the Imperial Palace. My wife insisted that we stay at the South Point on this trip and I had no arguement at all. This place is only 2 years old so everything is well kept and clean. The dealers and pit managers were hands down the most generous and friendliest of the dozen or so places I gambled in on the trip. You can tell these folks want and appreciate your business. I probably spent more time gambling at Harrahs and didn't get anything for the donations I made. South Point gave us breakfast and dinner comps for the time we spent on their tables - a small price for them given our time spent but it spoke volumes to me and earned my return trip business. After about a five hour stint on a table at Harrahs I asked for a breakfast comp and they laughed at me. The front desk and all the rest of staff were very friendly and helpful to us.

We flew from London and landed in LAX at around 4pm, and after picking up our rental car, we headed off for LV. We have done this journey several times over the past couple of years, but we had never experienced anything like the amount of traffic trying to get out of LA. The journey was a nightmare and took almost 8 hours to get to the SP in LV. My recommendation to anyone thinking of doing this journey over the Christmas and New Year period would be \u2013 JUST DON'T DO IT!! We arrived at the SP at midnight and as expected we sailed through check in, and we were given a large room on the 12th floor (Room 1261). Our room was right at the end of a very long corridor, but in order to compensate it was larger than the normal King room (apparently). The rooms are larger than the average LV hotel room anyway, and everything in our room was lovely and clean, spotless white sheets and glistening bathroom. Even though it was after midnight and we were both completed shattered from the journey, we checked everything was in order with the room. The furniture was ample with lots of drawer space and lots of hanging space (but not many hangers for a couple of people staying for 9 nights). Unfortunately there wasn't a safe in the room, so we ended up putting our valuables in our suitcase and locking it in the wardrobe. The room also had a table and two chairs, as well as a sofa, allowing different places to sit within the room. The huge plasma TV was a bonus, and because the room was large it made easy viewing when we were sat on the sofa. The bathrooms were decorated in earthy coloured tiles, and the sink area was separate from the toilet and bath area, which is ideal when you are sharing the time to get ready on a morning. The products that were with the bathroom were OK, nothing special, and not worth using really. To my husband\u2019s delight there was a coffee maker in the bathroom, but it only came with one regular and one decaffeinated coffee sachet and only one supply of milk and sugar\u2026 so it was only really OK for one drink, but they did get replenished on a daily basis (but really the best thing is to go to the Seattle\u2019s Best Coffee shop). On the first day we ate at the Coronado Caf\u00e9 and had a lovely breakfast, very nice surroundings, nice and bright and clean, only one downside was the speed of the service, it was a little slow, and we watched people who had arrived after us being served before us. We also ate evening meals here, we had something from the Chinese Menu, and it was delicious, and this time the service was spot on! Baja Miguel\u2019s was open on the first few days we were in the hotel, but then it was closed and boarded over, it is being replaced with a new restaurant called Michael\u2019s, I think it opens in the next few months. We can\u2019t comment on the buffet as we didn\u2019t eat there, but all in all the food outlets were very well received and the food was always well presented and tasted great. The hotel facilities are great; bowling, cinema, equestrian centre, exhibition centre, spa, barbers, pool (which was open all the time we were there, except on one very windy day) and of course the casino. The casino was always busy, and seemed to favour blackjack, craps and roulette. There were lots and lots of slot machines, and we seemed to leave about even, so I wouldn\u2019t describe them as being tight. I played roulette a few times, and this worked well for me and the dealers were very friendly and polite. One negative about the casino was the lighting \u2013 it was so bright all of the time, and you couldn\u2019t get away from the lights. Normally there is a subdued lighting regime in casinos, but not at the SP. If you are trying to hide a few skin complaints in the dark, then the SP casino is not for you. This is a shame really \u2013 if it had been a little darker I think there would have been a lot more ambience, however this was lacking due to the level of light in the room. Parking was never a problem; we always used valet parking and never had a problem with it \u2013 very fast and very friendly. There was a huge car park at the front of the hotel and a multi level car park at the north side. The views from our room were of the east of LV, and we could quite easily see Green Valley Ranch Resort, and over to the mountains towards Boulder City. We saw some great fireworks for New Year, but didn\u2019t see anything of the Strip\u2019s fireworks. Having stayed at the SP we would stay here again, and anyone who is staying here in the future should really consider hiring a car. We always hire a car when in LV, as you never know where you may decide to travel to (we travelled to Area 51 this time around) and having a car means having the freedom to make the journey to the strip. We didn\u2019t have any problems when heading towards the centre of the strip, in fact the I15 was more congested than the strip! On average it took 10-15 minutes to get to Caesars Palace \u2013 not bad really. Overall the SP is a lovely hotel that offers lots of facilities, and is great for parties of all types - families, couples, younger groups. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family with the proviso that they hire a car and build in travel time to and from the Strip for any plans that are made at the major Strip hotels. Staying in a hotel that is a few miles away from the Strip isn\u2019t a hindrance, it is an opportunity to make the most of an area that is up and coming, and quite a bit more serene than the bigger Strip Hotels. We enjoyed it and we hope that you do too!", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Wonderful Resort.

It has to be the best value in Vegas period. The rooms are luxurious. The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. The large screen tv was a huge bonus and the washroom was very large, upscale, and had a wonderful sprinkler head on the shower. I enjoyed some great food at the buffet. The breakfast buffet was $4.95. lunch $7.95, and dinner $11.95. For those prices it was a steal when you consider that you get for lunch barbaque ribs, turkey, chicken, all types of chinese and italian food as well as a large selection of deserts. In addition, they give you a coupon book at check-in, which includes a free buffet, free cocktails, as well as several other free things and discounts. One of the every day deals that they had at their main restaurant was $9.99 for a 16oz prime rib steak dinner. That included choice of potatoe, salad, soup, and mushrooms. Since I stayed here before, they emailed me a special rate that worked out to be $20 per night during my stay. I must say that I would find it extremely difficult to find such a deal elsewhere. I always rent a car so the location was no problem. Don't believe some of the other reviews that say it take a half hour to an hour to get to the strip. It never took me longer than 10 to 15 minutes. However, once you reach MGM the traffic becomes very heavy and it can take a long time to drive from the MGM north along the strip. Renting a car is the best way to go if you want to see all that Las Vegas and the surounding area has to offer. There are great side trips you can do like to the Valley of Fire, Red Rock Canyon, or the Hoover Dam to name a few. In addition, there is another great Casino Resort that just opened up in Sumerlin called the Red Rock Resort and Casino. It only took me a half an hour to get there using the freeway from the South Point. In general you can discover a lot more about Las Vegas by not getting glued to staying on the strip. If staying on the strip is not your major concern, there is no doubt that you will be very happy staying at the South Point Casino and Hotel. It is a new gem in Vegas and I can tell you I will be making it back here to stay over and over again. In fact, I was told that there are plans for billions of dollars in development in this area that will lead to the area being know as the south strip in the future.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cStay here if you love smoke\u201d", "Author": "flexibleflier", "ReviewID": "UR6544007", "Content": "This is one of those brand-new, but character-free hotels. I'm not one who's into themes, but a little ambience would have been nice. The casino was the smokiest I've seen in Las Vegas. It lacks the sophisticated air circulation that's appreciated in many of the strip casinos. Our clothing reeked of smoke the entire week because of this place. Even though our room was non-smoking, the hallways had a smoky odor as well. As for the rooms, yes, they are enormous, and if you can get past the sandpaper-like sheets, the beds are pretty comfortable. We also liked the flat-screen TV and the extra large bathroom. However, we hated that the windows didn't open to combat the dry, stale air. The pool area is pretty bare and looks like an afterthought on the hotel's part. Think astroturf and a few baby palm trees. South Point apparently finds it necessary to blast (and I mean BLAST) top 40 music, so if you're hoping to read a book or enjoy a tranquil, poolside nap, this is not the place. However, the pool itself is large and seems popular with the kiddies. If you like to work out, be prepared to fork over a $15 per-day spa fee. You see, the exercise room is part of the spa, and they don't care if you only want to use the treadmill. I opted to take a power walk around the local neighborhood, and it was free. I would also avoid the buffet unless you don't mind having to get up from your table to find someone to take your drink order. The hotel's 24-hour restaurant is also very mediocre. When we wanted to dine on a budget, we opted for Subway up the street. We are going to stay at The Orleans next time we come to Vegas.

First off, the South Point is located miles away from the Strip, and the difference is like night and day. The South Point is surrounded by strip malls and completely lacks the atmosphere of the Strip.

The purpose of our trip to the US was to attend a conference on the East Coast but decided to transit in Vegas for a few days beforehand. My husband and I have been to Vegas several times, but this time we had invited his bosses to come along with us. Firstly, I must admit it, the location is a bit of a problem. Spending a good half an hour to get into the heart of the Strip each day was a bit of a time waster, but we had a decent car and the traffic wasn't too bad so we shouldn't complain too much. However, now we have experienced an off strip hotel, we definately prefer being in the thick of things. Upon arrival to the hotel there were no bell boys to help us with our luggage (we had 8 cases between the 4 of use). This was very different to an on strip hotel - bell boys come running when you arrive at the Paris, Venetian etc. Even after waiting a few moments no one came. We checked in and that was a breeze - the front desk staff accomodated my request for a low, non-smoking floor and provided us with the necessary information about the hotel. There is security at the elevators 24/7 so that is always comforting to know that not just anyone can roam the floors. Our room was extremely comfortable and very clean. The bathrooms were great and the water pressure was pretty good! The plasma is a nice touch! The gym was great - I purchased a 3 day pass (worked out cheaper than paying each day). There is plenty of equipment, water, towels and complimentary fruit. The spa was a bit on the pricey side so I didn't have any treatments. When we joined the Coast Club we were greeted by a man who told us about the breakfast that starts at midnight and runs until 9am! Old school Las Vegas breakfast. $1.25 for pancakes, eggs, you name it, it's there. We had to do it, just for the experience, and it wasn't bad at all. We also ate breakfast at the buffet one morning which was pretty good also. We used the 2 for 1 voucher from the fun book we were given at check-in. Slots were extremely tight - for me anyway. I did watch a few people having some big wins throughout my stay so they weren't tight for everyone! All in all, our experience at the South Coast was pretty good, however I doubt that we will return as we definately like the heart of the strip better.

That's exactly what we got - parking and check in were a breeze, we didn't have to walk 5 miles to get to our room, and the room was a pleasant surprise. Clean, comfortable and alot nicer than other Vegas hotels we've stayed at in the past. Only complaint - we could have used a safe in our room. We spent alot of time in the hotel's casino, which was uncrowded and well ventilated. We dined at the Mexican restaurant, the cafe and the steakhouse. All were good and inexpensive. Had a light dinner at the deli too, but suggest avoiding that one. Paid an internet weekday rate of $69 and $89. Would definitely stay here again - this is our new favorite hotel in Vegas.", "Date": "October 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "AnnapolisMD", "Title": "\u201cGreat family resort (now called the South Point)\u201d", "Author": "AnnapolisMD", "ReviewID": "UR6014857", "Content": "Stayed October 21-25 for a convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center. We chose this hotel because of Travel Advisor recommendations and we did not wish to be either in a chain hotel or a Strip hotel. 7 miles south of the strip and McCarran airport. In the center of newly built up area of nice strip shopping centers and condos and the outlets. Right off 15 on the southern extension of Las Vegas Blvd (the Strip). We booked two rooms at reasonable prices ($65 less per day Tuesday and Wednesday and $35 less on Monday than the weekend rate. It was also $90 a day per room less than the convention hotel's quoted rate. We spent our savings at two Cirque du Soleils and two great restaurants (Craftsteak and Bouchon). This is a family style resort that just happens to have a casino area. Decor is very bright reds and yellows and a lot of wrought iron in public areas. Earth toned large rooms with two queen beds, 42 in. HD TV in wall, adequate closet and drawer space, adjustable A/C. One room had a view of the high rise parking garage but absolutely no noise; the other was pool view and occupants \"felt the beat\" (whether they wanted to or not) of the band playing on the pool deck for a convention. Could not hear neighbors or hallway noise.Toilet and shower in separate room from double vanity helped with privacy for two unrelated women sharing a room for the convention. .Positives: It was built in December 2005 and was the most pristine establishment I have ever seen. The finish workmanship, from painting to carpeting, was super (from someone in the trades). Good buffets at $6.49 or less before using two for one coupons; $9.99 T bone and prime rib that are thick and cooked to order. $1.25 breakfast but watch those $2 juices and cups of coffee as it does run up. Bingo hall, child care, bowling alley, saw a movie on one of their 12 movie screens with a remarkable selection of snacks (including Starbucks and free popcorn). Free drink tickets for those who drink alcohol and assorted discounts on all other amenities. We were surprised to see an indoor equestrian center that rivals any smaller university fieldhouse: immaculate, and we got to see the Clydesdales and take in a Paint horse (like Tonto's) western riding competition with the participants in their sequined body suits and some phenomenally well trained horses (and it was FREE!). Highlight of our non-gambling trip! Great pillows, great sheets, great pool with huge jacuzzi, separate children's area, sand volleyball court; Seattle's Best shop and an ice cream parlor, and security that checks room cards before allowing anyone into the hotel section. (And also opened wine bottles with cheap corkscrews for two of our party!). Oh, and the Spa and Kevin, a super massage therapist. All staff, from the waitress in the coffee shop to Jaime in the buffet to the movie's ticket person and concessions cashier, bell desk help and the bartender in the casino bar were nice and helpful at all times (we even had great cab drivers). You get disoriented in big, bright casinos and they directed us all over. And everyone had recommendations about sights that were solidly good. All the tours can pick up at the hotel and our group really enjoyed the Hoover Dam/Lake Mead cruise and Ethel M (local chocolates--this is the home of M and Ms) visit. Negatives: Not enough soap for two people; no concierge service for tickets for things not at South Coast (there is a travel agency that can book and not sure of service charge but there was only one staff member and a line). We did not care at all for the surly personnel on the free airport shuttle (one kicked us off the airport shuttle and strode toward the casino saying he was calling Security when we got in the van, even while holding up our room key cards--we had no idea we needed reservations to ride--figured it was the SC's misguided adherence to terrorist levels). The shuttle to the Strip was slightly better but not everyone is interested in 20 minutes of Christian commentary and a driver who never even turned to acknowledge us, not to mention be pleasant). $25 fare (with trip) each way to the most southerly sections of the Strip (lotsa traffic but all the strip hotels have parking and it would be a lot cheaper to drive one's own car but maybe not so to rent a car). Limited TV channels for those who neither watch sports nor gamble and something was wrong with the in room movie set up. Hair dryer blew up but was fixed promptly. The day before we left the hotel was bought back by its creator and all the slot functions were shut down from evening until midday. Overnight all signage was changed. The staff seemed to like the previous owner and was very relaxed. However, I am sure there were people who had come down to hit the slots (there were lots of local people there) and it would have been disappointing to them. There must be a reason why it wasn't announced in at least a posted sign. This hotel offers great value for not much money in a perfectly safe and family-oriented area. I surely hope it is successful. We were amazed at the friendliness of all the Nevada residents we met and would surely recommend this as a fine trip for those who don't even gamble (check out the Neon Museum and the Atom Bomb Testing museum).

One nice touch was the clock radio that had an AUX connector to pipe your iPod through the radio speaker. Big disappointment with the room was that there was no in-room fridge. The in-room coffee maker had a \"disposable\" coffee filter tray, which I missed on Day One (I thought a part was missing from the coffee maker). Another nice touch: we got a coupon booklet upon checkin that contained free drink coupons, BOGO entree coupons, BOGO ice cream sundaes...we used a couple of drink coupons, but that was about it. It's obvious that they're marketing couples with kids, with the arcade, movie theater and bowling alley on site. We spent some time at the pool area (which had towels, a cafe, a jacuzzi, a wading pool, an outdoor shower, and a volleyball court). Unfortunately, they closed it early (at 6 pm!) for private parties on both Saturday and Sunday nights. Finally, the hotel itself was WAY further from the real Strip than the website leads you to believe. It took us nearly an hour from the hotel to the Paris on Saturday night, even though we set out for the Paris early - at 5:45 pm!

The hotel is very far south of the strip and the drive takes at least ten minutes or more to reach Mandalay Bay/MGM. They have a free shuttle to Barbary Coast and the airport but get to the shuttle stop early - it was always full (we did manage to get a seat each time). You need to make reservations for the airport shuttle by calling the front desk. The hotel isn't any particular \"theme\" and doesn't go to any great lengths on decor, so you can get lost in the sea of slot machines if you aren't careful. I wish they would have located the front desk of the hotel anywhere else except on the slot floor. We didn't have much of a wait during our check in, but it was 3pm on a Sunday. The room rate was very reasonable at $89.00. The hotel portion of the South Coast is great. There is a guard near the elevators checking room keys, and there are two elevator banks, one for lower floors and one for upper floors, so we never had to wait even one minute for an elevator. The rooms are a nice size and the beds/linens were great. The plasma screen TV is awesome, as is the huge picture window overlooking the mountains. The only thing I thought could be improved is the slightly cheap looking furniture (table.chairs/sofa), but it was typical motel stuff, not bad. The bathrooms and toiletry products were great. They have a shower head similar to the \"heavenly shower by Westin\". During our stay, the water pressure and temperature were fine. The South Coast has a wonderful pool and hottub area just off the elevator bank. The hot tub is warm and has plenty of jets - it is in a circle around an island, so you don't have to sit and stare at the folks across the tub from you - nice. The pool is very large but was too cold for an October afternoon. We didn't try the bowling alley or theater, but those are nice options if gambling is not your thing. We ate at Coronado Cafe and Don Vitos and both had good food with decent service. The Del Mar Deli had OK sandwiches, but they also had an awesome selection of desserts if you want a sweet treat. There is an ice cream parlor near the front door, next to the Coffee Bar (which closed at 9pm, a ridiculous thing for a casino). Most of the slots are new penny or nickel slots with a few dollars scattered here and there. Tons of video poker (we won a progressive Deuces Wild jackpot during our visit) and we played on the huge new Wheel of Fortune multi-player slot for hours without putting in more money. I saw many people playing on lots of credits, so I think the slots were pretty loose, although I didn't see any \"big\" winners. They have many $5 table games and a small poker room. The conference center was nicely appointed and the food was good. The management team seemed a bit disorganized, however, and we learned this hotel was recently sold and will soon be the South Pointe. They weren't really interested rebooking our small meeting again, even though the exhibit hall was completely empty Sunday - Wednesday, so I think the sales team here may be one of the reasons the hotel is considered to be \"underperforming\" by Vegas standards.

The hotel has a good buffet (lunch = $8) and service was good. Pool was small, but great. It had a nice atmosphere and a separate area for the hot tub.

On the website and in the hotel room South Coast mentions having a 24 hour fitness center, well the true was the fitness center was only open from 6am to 8pm AND costed $15 per day or $39 for three days to use (funny how that fee is no where in print). This was not mentioned until after we had been there almost a week and have been in and out of the fitness center many times. 2. Vegas is suppose to be cheap when it comes to eating a good meal, however, the food at the Garden Buffet, Del-Mar, and Baja Miguel's was pricey and substandard. 3.

Brought our kids aged 7 and 5 and couldn't believe how nice the stay turned out. First of all, the geography as background. South Coast is 6 miles south of the McArren International Airport. It was interesting that when we got on the taxi after the millions of other people seeking cabs, we were probably the only ones heading \"South\". All the strip, downtown, East and West casinos are North of McArren. Felt an interesting tinge of concern mixed with anticipation, as all the glitter that used to represent Vegas to me faded in the opposite direction and the open road unwound in front of us. The only other major casino down in that area is the Silverton which has a huge Bass Pro Shop attached to it. Think about that, other cities are sprawling away from their nucleus, Vegas is sprawling into the nucleus. The opportunities to do more out in the \"open space\" is fantastic. Witness the Bass Pro Shop at Silverton or the Orleans Arena at Orleans and it makes unbelievable amounts of sense for more of the big money to build resorts a little further from the strip. Currently, Wynn, MGM, Las Vegas Sands, etc. are pumping billions into that magnificent four miles guaranteeing that the strip will always be the strip or at least for the foreseeable future. Given the land availability you wonder how much longer until that changes, the Barnes and Nobles, Best Buys, PF Changs and Walgreens of the world are learning to use the open land to their advantage all across the country and build out the burbs. Vegas, which is always unique is the only city where all the new investment dollars are piling into this little strip, even if they have to build highrises, witness the new million dollar condo high rises on the strip. The reasons I provide this tangential background are twofold- to provide a frame of reference for the incredible things that an off strip property is able to do because of cheaper real estate and more room to do it with and particularly because they have to be better to get you to stay that far away from the rest of the action. South Coast (soon to be re-christened South Pointe) goes the extra mile to please. The rooms are very large and all have flat panel 42 inch TVs, the beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are spacious with a separate door area to the commode for privacy. How much did we pay for some of the best standard rooms in Las Vegas? They could have easily gone for $150 a night at center strip properties, but our rooms were $42 a night on Monday and Tuesday, probably more on weekends, etc. Pulling up to the property you can appreciate its behemoth size and nice architectural design. Ample parking everywhere and regular shuttles to airport, LV strip and Gold Coast, etc. The swimming pool was awesome with a unique lazy river hot tub and palm trees. When we got there they were running a promotion and gave us a whole bunch of free tee shirts. The bowling alley has state of the art computer equipment and is a blast, the kids arcade was a huge highlight for our two little ones. They also have a large day care center which we never needed because we were having so much fun with the kids, but would have been nice to take advantage of in certain times. Buffet was stellar, great selection and half off coupons in the fun book. Plus kids were half off. The four of us ate ourselves absolutely silly for a total including tax and tips of $20. They also had nice bottles of wine for $6 a bottle. Funbooks are great and have discounts on the food, cocktails, gift shop, bowling, etc. The fried chicken , sweet and sour chicken, salads, pastas, seafood, and deserts were all good. Later we went to the strip and had a blast seeing Flamingo, Bellagio fountains and \"all that jazz\" but to be honest most of our best memories of this trip were created right at the good old South Coast. The shuttle was easy to catch and a nice rest spot between walks. The strip has a lot of great stuff but to be honest is getting too crowded and congested. With Kerkorian, Boyd and company building all these condos (and these men are legendary geniuses of this city so they will do well) but the point being the crowded and noise factors of the strip will eventually drive continued construction in the South, Boulder Strip etc. as more and more people like us who love Vegas but get to tired trying to navigate the strip, find out you can have all the fun of Vegas at one third the price, just a few short miles away from all that neon. The one place that is the worst on the strip is Caesars Palace which has mind numbing arrays of shopping,entertainment, and so on and is unbelievable but consistently takes at least three hours (no exaggeration) to get from one end to the other of the property. This is another fabulous feature of the South Coast. You walk in and check out is right there, then the Casino, Seattle's Best Coffee all the restaurants etc. so amazingly easy to navigate and the bowling, movie theaters, child care ,etc. is right up one easy escalator. The people working at the casino are basically friendly and one guy from San Diego working at the Casino bar was very friendly and smiled the whole time. This place really makes you feel at home.

We were celebrating his 30th birthday and neither of us had ever visited Las Vegas. I had a ton of friends that had and they gave us recommendations of places to stay. I chose the SouthCoast because of the appearance via the internet. I thought the things they offered was a good deal. I booked through hotels.com and I didn't get the low rates that I see listed now or the other reviews have boasted about. In any case it was still worth it to me. I see that in looking at the reviews you have to be extremely careful because most people seem to pick apart every little thing. I would be curious to see some of the homes if they judge the hotels so critically :-).... The overall appearance was very nice and we found the registration attendants to be kind enough and everyone we asked for direction or assistance seemed to be more than willing to assist. Well, other than one of the shuttle bus drivers but maybe he was tired. No excuse, but I wasn't there to make friends with him rather to get a ride to the strip. I enjoyed the food at Baja Miguels and the Garden buffet and YES-use the coupons. I especially enjoyed the free margarita at Baja Miguels and everything we ordered was tasty. The pool was nice enough and while we were there the weather was GREAT... The room was huge (the King size bed) and the bathroom made 2 of mine here at home. My boyfriend enjoyed the fact that you really didn't have to leave the hotel for anything because the gaming tables were there and he was able to join in a poker tournament onsite. I didn't think to ask to be upgraded and I didn't know about getting a fridge in the room for an extra cost but I do now. In terms of transportation I would say that more shuttles should be added and definitely more available times. We rode the shuttle twice (to and from the strip) and then once on the strip we jumped on the bus (the deuce). Once we were leaving we found out the trolley was right across the street and an all day pass was only $6.50 which is not bad. The trolley goes all the way up to the north side of the strip which isn't bad at all. We could have rented a car but I think that would have been a waste. We are in the process for booking another stay for longer and at the South Coast. It truly depends on what you expect in a hotel and the things you would like to do. If you want to be near the action then SouthCoast is not for you. Personally all of those people would drive me CRAZY! I can't wait to go back to enjoy the spa and the gym (by next year those things should be available for use) and oh yeah (the hallway on my floor was freezing.

Needing a well deserved short get-a-way from So-Cal, it was either stay a night a two (on the strip) or stay for three nights at the South Coast. Well, at under $50/night we booked at the South Coast - priced well below \"better\" hotels on the strip. On check in, I casually asked if we can be upgraded to a \"suite.\" For $50, we were upgraded. I tried to negotiate that down but, they said due the low rate I got, it was $50. At first, I thought it was per night but, it was only $50 for all three nights ... still very cheap price wise. The hotel is nice and the best part; still new. We are not smokers and our child is never around smokers. So, the hotel did not have that smoke-filled aroma that dominates a lot of older hotels (we took the kid to the Nascar Cafe to eat on the strip and while eating everyone's eyes were turning red and burning due to cigarette smoke). The layout of the suite was kinda wierd to me. The flat screens were nice but, watching it in the seating area was not really comfortable as the screen is about 6ft from the couch (basically, it is to close because the area is narrow). The bedroom and bathroom are very nice. Just very clean and simple. But, you won't get the \"Wow\" factor by the decor as compared to the better hotels on the strip. The suite only had one bed so, we had to get a rollaway bed which was very small and NOT comfortable. The only way to get two beds is to have a standard room which in the end we may have been better off having vs upgrading. I did have issue with the A/C system. During our nights of sleep I was awakened by loud sounds coming from the A/C unit; it was very loud. Each time the A/C would kick on it would make loud sounds; something like someone was banging on something inside the air duct. The pool area did not impress me. The main pool is very shallow - i think the deepest part is 4'. The large hot tub is nice but, we noticed the water was comfortable on Sunday but, very hot on Monday since the waterfall part was not running. Also, it seemed like more people were in the hot tub than in the main pool so; I can only imagine how crowded it could be on a Saturday. We found \"service\" to be terrible at the pool. We were told \"someone\" was to walk around and take orders for drinks and food; we even got a menu from this area where you can get drinks (but, not food). Both days we were in the pool area not once did somebody come out and each time were in the pool area for 3 hours. Also, there is lots of construction going on so there was a lot of consistant loud banging and foot traffic from employees who I guess were setting up the gym/spa area; which was not open during out stay. The bowling alley did impress me. It was very large and not what I would expect. The only issue is that there are only a limited number of lanes at times because there is league bowling events. So, the bowling alley and even the cheap after midnight prices are open to everybody; meaning if you want to have fun bowling you don't have to stay there to do it. We were on the 23rd floor and one thing I did notice was that the same cigarette butt and wine glass was left in the hallway for two days. Also, on check in, the hallway was very hot. Even air blowing out the vents was hot. On the next days, the reverse happened, the air was freezing cold. They were also doing a test of the backup generators the morning of our checkout but, luckily that did not affect us since we drove in to Vegas and did not have to get up early to catch a taxi and/or plane at the airport. As everyone states do get the Fun Book. We used it to get a free drink, the two for one ice cream sundae, the free bowling games, and on check out we used it for the Breakfast Buffet which I actually thought was pretty decent with many options for the money; $18 for three adults and one child. The Coronado Cafe is good too. We had breakfast there one morning only. We tried the late night thing but, being tired we decided not to because even past midnight, there was a line of people waiting to be seated/get in! But, since the hotel is near the Las Vegas Outlets there are many outside choices to eat. There is even a Food 4 Less although if you want a fridge in your room it's $15/night. Personally, if we could spend $100-200+/night, I would have stayed somewhere else. The majority of our time was away from the hotel either on the strip or shopping. If staying somewhere else and had to the urge to bowl, I'd make a visit there to do it. Even at $100/night, if you get a room at the Luxor, Mandalay Bay, or MGM Grand, I think overall you'll be more satisfied vs. paying $50/night at The South Coast. If you have kids, Mandalay Bay or MGM just have better pools for them and the immediate area will have \"more\" for them to do.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cunorganized hotel\u201d", "Author": "enyioma", "ReviewID": "UR5717079", "Content": "My best friend, her boyfriend and I check into the South Coast hotel on Thurs. Aug 23,2006. The appearance of the hotel was nice. The casino was spacious with not alot of cigarrette smoke. The room was nice with a beautiful bathroom. I was upset about the gym and the spa not being available for me to work out and relax. I had to go to a local gym a few miles from the hotel. I asked them the reason and they told me that it needed to get it's final approval which would be at the beginning of Sept. On Friday and Sunday the electricity and the water was cut off I could not use the bathroom for at least one hour which was an inconvience for me. They did this to test the back up generator which should have been done before the hotel open up. On Saturday, we order for room service. They made a mistake and went to the wrong room. We had two rooms. They were suppose to come to my friends room which was across from my room. They came to my room and I was not there. Room service knew that we had 2 rooms. They did not attempt to try the other room across. They said that they knock on my friend's door, but my friend's boyfriend was in the room all day waiting for the food and did not hear anyone knock on the door. They threw the food away. We asked them if they could bring us another breakfast and they said that it would take another 1 hour. We decided to go to I Hop, located 3 miles from the hotel. On Saturday the hotel had a concert which was located at the pool. Everyone had to leave the pool at 3:00pm so that they could prepare for the concert. That threw my whole day off. When they started the concert you were able to hear it from inside your room. It was hard for us to watch TV. We complain to the front desk and they told us that they did not have any rooms available. My friend suggested that it is probably best if we check out and they say if we decided to do that then we have 5 minutes to check out. If they are going to have concert they should invest in some sound proof windows. They should also invest in another area to have their concert because it is unfair to tell people to leave the pool to have a concert. I feel that if you spent your money for an hotel room all the amneties should be included and not excluded to benefit the hotel management. The flat screen TV were nice but they need to use the money to better organize the hotel.

I travel to Las Vegas two to four times a year and for the most part always stay on the strip. This was a solo stay as I was working as a volunteer at an equesterian event at the horse arena for the weekend. I found my stay to be a really pleasant experience and I would stay here again in a heartbeat! Room: PERFECT size , not too small, not too big plenty of space for just me! I had two queen beds on the 24th floor with a great view of the mountains. Beds very comfortable, actual closet, great big plasma tv, excellent size vainity area with marble top and tile floor. The room was decorated in all horse themed paintings which was really fitting for me! Toilet and shower room was a little small but workable. Shower had a really nice huge water head and a curved curtain rod. Loved the soaps and shampoos (came in little \"jars\"), in fact housekeeping was very generous with extras when I requested. Extremely quiet floor, I didn't hear a thing outside in the hallway. Loved the color scheme and furniture. Food: Ate at the Coronordo Cafe twice, had the chinese food selection and that was decent, service a bit slow but friendly. Had a meal at the Mexican food place and it was very good, but the resturant is pretty small so a line forms quickly. Ate one dinner buffet, very average and not much better than say a Golden Corral paid around $14. Also ate one breakfast buffet, much better than dinner and paid around $7. Drink service at the buffets was pretty slow, I had to make myself noticed to get refills and get my plates cleaned away. One night I wanted room service but there was an hour wait for food and this was at 10 pm! Had several coffees at the Seattles Best and one ice cream at the ice cream stand which was ok. Casino: About a medium size, tons of video poker machines (I'd say at least half of the machines there wer VP). I play very little VP but did find some PENNY VP! Otherwise lots of newer slots, lots of pennies, nickles , quarters some dollars and a high limit area. Did not find the machines any looser than what I've experienced on the Strip unfortantuly!! No big wins here, just enough to keep me playing! Had the giant Wheel of Fortune Super Spin machine. Plenty of table games too. Cocktail service was about average to slow and drinks were really weak; don't order the margaritas! Casino was easy to get around and not very smoky at all; must have a good ventalation system. Clientele: My impression is that this is a locals casino with just enough tourist thrown in. LOTS of families, mostly middle class or working class folk, won't see the \"beautiful people\" here like at Belliago or Ceasars. There was a really nice laid back atmosphere to the place. There was a basketball camp going on the weekend I was there so that probably explained why the amount of kids in the hotel. Staff: Very friendly though not in much of a hurry a lot of times. Security was everywhere and your room key was checked all day and all night and these security guys took their job really seriously!! Good check in/out ; no problems with that. The shuttle buses ran on time, really on time! If the schedule said the bus left at 11 AM then yes the bus LEFT at 11 AM. Very effecient! I used both the airport and strip shuttle, which was a great service to have. Saved me $$ on cabs or car rental. I had very good housekeeping for the four days I was there. Suggestions: If you are used to staying on the Strip this casino/hotel is a bit south and is all by it's lonesome. NO other casinos within walking distance or resturants for that matter. However, all the properties around this area are being developed like gangbusters so it won't be by it's self too much longer. If you like to stay at one hotel, this is a nice one. If you like to casino hop, stay on the Strip. Arena: For horse people, the arena was really nice! It's totally climate controlled, in fact it was 110 degrees one day and inside the arena it was around 70! Arena is horse show size and seats about 4,500. Bathrooms easy to find and large but only two concession stands with average concession stand food and prices!! Very nice place for a horse show!

We had a regular king room that was fairly large. The bed was wonderful and the plasma incredible. we plugged in the ipod to the TV and just relaxed after the road trip. The hotel let us check in at noon and we were given a room on the 14th floor overlooking the pool. The service was excellent everywhere with two exceptions- When we checked the line was long and we got a little grumpy. When we got to the desk we found out the key making computer was down so they were having to code the keys by hand. So that was forgiven. In the breakfast buffet, we got there around 9:55. It stops letting people in at 10:00. So when we were winding down from breakfast, all the servers were busy changing out the tables and such so our waitress was not to be found. we had to hijack a bus boy for our coffee refills.

The facility was first class, as described by most of the other reviewers. The rooms were spacious, and nicely furnished. The plasma TV was nice, but we only watched it for about as long as it took to fall asleep each night. In my opinion, the money would have been better spent on other amenities. We play mostly video poker, and there were many machines available with 100% payback tables (if you know what you're looking for). The cocktail waitresses were always availabe when we needed a refill. The pool was very nice, with poolside bar service at very reasonable prices. However, we will probably not stay at the South Coast again. We like to spend time on the Strip, and the shuttle service did not meet our needs, so we spent over $200 in cab fares in three days. We could have rented a car, but then we would have had to deal with the hassle of fighting traffic and finding parking. If you like to go to Vegas and stay in one place, this is the place for you. If you like to spend at least part of your time on the Strip and/or downtown, you will probably be happier staying at one of the Strip hotels.", "Date": "August 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel for the $$$ on Las Vegas Blvd.\u201d", "Author": "Briannakristi", "ReviewID": "UR5529704", "Content": "My family and I stayed at this new Hotel and Casino for three nights.

We did have a rental so it worked for us. Checkin was easy however they need more folks at the desk as there was only 2 employees running the desk so I waited about 8-10 mins. It was 11:00 but this is Vegas! We were given room 1062 on the 10th floor and I was impressed to say the least. It was a suite and lovely!! For 59.00 internet rate off of their website you can not beat it. The room was clean and large. Soft bed, clean sheets, huge bathroom with walk in shower and a large tub not to mention the 2 flat screen tv's and a nice view. I called the next morning was given a late checkout since we got in so late which was super nice for us as we slept in a bit longer. We had a late dinner in the resturant and it was good. Now is it a 5 star resturant...no but it worked. We had lunch at the buffet the next afternoon and we both had lunch for 8.00 including drinks with the fun book coupon they give you when you check in. The buffet was good and for 8.00 I had no idea what to expect but I was pleasently suprised. After eating we went bowling at their in house bowling alley, it was huge! Maybe 26 or more lanes. They also have a 16 screen movie theater on site as well playing current movies. This place has it all with the exception of a spa however that is due to open at the end of summer.

That night we must have seen 20 cop cars on the strip (northbound?) between Mandalay & South Coast probably to catch drunk drivers, and parking was a nightmare because there was a lot of pedestrians and security milling around. I'd suggest checking out what events they have going on while your there so you know better what to expect. We had an interesting mix of crazy old school rock-n-rollers and laid back cowboys. Also, I wouldn't recommend their 24-hour cafe, the food is okay but reminded me a bit of cafeteria or school food (very bland).

I'm a bargain hunter so on past trips I've stayed at Bally's (4 times), Excalibur, Monte Carlo, and Stratosphere. For this trip, June 25-30, I thought I might enjoy something away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, especially since I planned to have rental car. I decided on the South Coast because it is new and also from the glowing reviews on Trip Advisor. Maybe I was expecting too much, but by the time it was time for me to leave I was ready to return to the Strip. Here are a few highlights: Location: yes, it is far from the Strip, a 15-20 minute drive to the Flamingo Road (Bellagio, Caesars, Bally's, Flamingo) intersection, longer if there's traffic, and when isn't there traffic? Check-in on Sunday afternoon was a bit slow - only 2 clerks on duty. But they were friendly and efficient. I've been spoiled by Bally's airport check-in so maybe I was just impatient. No problems with the reservation (booked online on the South Coast website for $69 a night). Room: as others have commented, my 14th floor room was very nice, as to be expected from a new property. Bed very comfy. Bathroom clean - nice touches included the curved shower curtain and a very nice shower head for great coverage. Also a comfortable mini-couch and table (for reading the Racing Form). Did not use the Internet access. Plasma TV was OK - the picture was not as crisp as other plasmas I've seen, but still nicer than the standard dinosaur-age TV's found in most hotel rooms. Fun book: disappointing. Others have commented favorably about the fun book, but I thought it was lacking. No match play coupons (boo!), and the 2-for-1 buffet deal was useless to me as a single traveler. Casino: smaller than most Strip properties (to be expeected) but the dealers and floor personnel were always friendly and helpful and it always felt like it was \"fun\" to gamble there. The atmosphere was lively but not overly raucous. Clientele seemed a bit more \"working class\" than most Strip properties. Race and sports book personnel were also very nice, as were the poker room staff. I played in 3 morning tournaments ($37 buy in) and although I didn't cash in any of them, had a great time playing. Food: the best thing I can say about the buffet is that it was cheap. And you get what you pay for. Quality and service were inconsistent. some food items were hot and fresh, others were cold and stale. Some servers were quick with coffee/drink refills, others disappeared for long periods. For convenience I ate the breakfast buffet every morning; I sure wish they had food court, just for a change of pace. I ate one meal in the cafe when I arrived too late for the dinner buffet. Had the chicken caesar salad and it was good (except for a couple of pieces of wilted romaine lattuce); service was also good. I did not try the specialty restaurants (Italian, Steakhouse, Mexican) but the prices at those seemed high (hey, I warned you I was bargain hunter). I did not try the bowling (I can bowl at home), the arcade (same), the pool (it was 110+ degrees every day, too hot to be outside for any reason), or visit the horse center (the only horses I am interested in carry jockeys on their backs). One complaint: when I tried to use a fun book coupon for a free drink at the casino bar, the bartender ignored me for what seemed forever, serving several others who sat down well after I did, before finally and grudgingly serving me a draft beer. I would have liked to have stayed for 3 or 4 more paid beers (and healthy tip) but Mr. Sourpuss's attitude chased me away.

We also played bowling at 7am for $1 a game!! The breakfast buffet is amazing value and the food is fresh and hot with plenty of choices, the Sunday brunch is good too.

The coupon book at check in for 2 for 1 breakfast buffet, free drinks and players club points was a very nice touch. The staff were all very friendly. No problems whatsoever in that department. The casino was nice and new. Drinks were cheap and they comp'd you like crazy. The slot machines were a tiny bit tight, but not at all like people have been making them out to be. Low table limits were very nice also (my girlfriend loved the $1 minimum roulette). The place had a pulse but was not over crowded by any means. Crowd was a good mix of ethnicity and ages. The 64 lane bowling center was very nice. The arcade is kind of weak, not that I care because you can't drink or gamble in there, but I figure its worth mentioning if you plan on taking the kids. The pool was nice enough, nothing to write home about but new, nice, and served its purpose. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants except for the breakfast buffet. The price was right ($6.95 for two people with the coupon they give you at check in), but was not all that impressive. Stick to the Omlette bar, stay away from the sausage, and you should be alright.

The pool was beautiful, there wasn't bugs flying around, a couple of reviews I've read here have mentioned about lots of bugs flying by the pool due to the houses next door, but when we were there, the pool area was very clean, the hotel must have done something to fix up the problem. Upon check in at the hotel, we received a coupon booklet, it has some good deals including two for one breakfast buffet or two for one lunch buffet. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus to and from the airport, and also to and from the strip. One of the reviews I've read here was written by a couple who had mentioned that they stayed at the South Coast and got a few looks by the staff and hotel guest because they are Asians, and they have noticed that most of the hotel guests were North American (Whites). It's very unfortunate that they had that experience. However, my husband and I are Asians, and we did not get any looks, actually during our week long stay at the hotel, we have noticed that the overall hotel guests were quite multi-cultural, it was a good mixture, and we are very glad about the multi cultural, we are from Toronto. The housekeeping staff were mostly very nice and polite, except for Emma - she is a very rude and terrible housekeeping staff, she has zero customer service, and personally I think she really needs to take a course in Anger Management. When I go to a new place, I have this habit of doing a general check-up on the room to make sure everything is clean and good, especially the bed, it has to be clean. So after we got into our room upon check in, I looked at the sheets and the pillow on the bed, I found several dark colored stains on the bed sheet, and a couple pieces of hair on the pillow, so my husband went to the hallway and asked a housekeeping staff to change the bedding for us. About ten minutes later, this housekeeping lady just rushed into our room, her name is Emma (according to her name tag), she did not even knock on the door, she just used her key card and came in, she did not even say hello or anything, the first sentence came out of her mouth was \"What's the problem with the bed? Where are the stains?\" So I showed her the stains and I also mentioned about the hair I found on the pillow, she said the pillows are all fresh and clean. Then she changed our bed sheets with an attitude. After that, I asked her to change our pillows for us, she said \"Why, the pillows are fresh and clean?\" Then I said to her \"I found several pieces of long hair on the pillow, how do you explain this?\" She replied \"Who knows, maybe it's from the air in the room.\" She then left our room with a very angry face to get the new pillows, then I realized that one of our light bulbs was out, so I followed her and mentioned it to her, when I was talking to her, she was facing another housekeeping staff, when the other housekeeping staff said to our rude housekeeping staff (Emma) that \"I think this lady is talking to you.\" Without even looking at me, all Emma said was \"I know she's talking to me, and I heard what she said.\" So then I went back to my hotel room, a few minutes later, our rude housekeeping staff Emma came back to our room and put the pillows on the bed, she then used our room phone to call the main housekeeping phone number and told me that one of our light bulbs needs to be replaced. Then without a word to us, she left and slammed our door. I then realized that the small bottle of lotion in our bathroom was almost empty, usually it should be full. So again I went to find Emma, she was just a couple of doors down from our room, before I even opened my mouth, she said to me \"I'm very busy, what do you want?\" I said to her \"Well, obviously I have another enquiry, otherwise I wouldn't be bothering you right now.\" Without even looking at me, she said \"Call downstairs, I'm very busy, don't bother me!\" I couldn't believe her attitude, her attitude went from worse to unbelievably worse! She just seemed to be a very angry person, she really needs to take a course in Anger Management! A couple of minutes later, we got a knock on the door, so I went and opened the door, this nice lady with a smile said to me \"I'm just doing a room check. I asked her who I can call to make a complaint about the housekeeping staff.\" She told me that she is the Supervisor of the housekeeping department, she said I can call the housekeeping Director about the complaint, and she also asked me if there's anything she can help me with. So I told her everything that had happened re Rude Emma's unprofessional attitude, after Supervisor heard everything I said, she apologized, and she made notes to what I said, she told me that she will forward this to the housekeeping Director. After that experience, my husband and I went to the front desk and requested to a room change, we wanted a room with a nice view, and personally I didn't want to deal with Emma or even see Emma again during the rest of my stay at the hotel, so we got a room on the 22nd, we were originally on the 6th floor. Other than the rude experience we have had with Emma, all the other staff in the hotel were very nice and kind, including the housekeeping staff, the restaurant staff, the front desk staff, and the staff at the gift shop. I would give this review a 5, however, due to the experience with Emma, I'm giving this review a 4. My husband and I would definitely go back to the South Coast Hotel the next time we visit Vegas, and hopefully the next we go there, we won't have Emma as our housekeeping staff again for our room.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cSouth Coast Rocks!\u201d", "Author": "shanshanjan", "ReviewID": "UR5394462", "Content": "My Sister and I originally booked at the South Coast for the cheap price.

The hotel / casino is perfect for anyone on a budget. There are low-minimum tables ($5) for Blackjack, Pai Gow Poker, Craps, and $1 Roulette. In addition, weekend room rates can be had for less than $100 per night (in our case it was $87 / night). The hotel also has a great selection of activities for non-gamblers, including a bowling alley, movie theater, pool, and equestrian center. The bowling alley was a lot of fun and reasonably priced - $2.90 per game and $2.50 for shoes. The pool area is large and features cocktail service. The room was spacious and the 42-inch plasma was great for watching TV. The bathrooms were also large with a long bathroom counter seperate from the shower / bathroom. Also, the rooms were very quiet thanks to heavy, solid doors that kept hallway noise out. Hotel service was acceptable. Employees were friendly and the in-room maintenance to fix a clogged sink reported in five minutes. However, requests for late check-out and rollaway bed in a room with two Queen Beds were denied. The room had plenty of space for an additional bed near the wall and this has been a permittable request in most hotels with even smaller square footage. The Garden Buffet is a great deal and the South Coast Funbook offers a 2-for-1 coupon for Breakfast and Lunch buffets. At lunch and dinner the buffet offered peel-n-eat shrimp, mahi mahi, roasted turkey, beef brisket, Mongolian BBQ, and all of it was great. For visitors staying on Sunday morning, be sure to save the 2-for-1 coupon for Sunday Brunch. It's 11.95 but adds prime rib to the selection. We also tried the 24-hour Coronado Cafe but were disappointed. From fries, to burgers, to strawberry waffles, the food was underwhelming, wasn't that cheap, and the wait was long. Also, the heavily advertised Graveyard Special Steak and Eggs for $3.95 is only available Mon. - Thurs. South Coast is a great hotel with enough action to keep many from heading out to the Strip. Great room pricing, gambling, buffet, and non-gaming activites make it an attractive alternative to more expensive strip locations.

A little tip... if you plan to utilize the shuttle going to the sister hotel Barbary Coast, make certain you are out and waiting 30 minutes before departure or you won't get on. These shuttles filled so fast! Also, make sure you check the airport shuttle times from the hotel so you book the best departure time out of Vegas.

It's a new hotel/casino so everything is clean and nice. They have a very large drive thru area to drop off or valet. However it was very sparsely attended but we did drive in at a ridiculous hour as there was some construction on the way from LA. There was plenty of parking out front of the main entrance so we didn't bother valeting. Check-in was easy (one good thing about early a.m. arrival). Room was average size and clean. large bathroom. Good temp control. Pool was nice and is very similar to Orleans with a main pool and a kiddie/wading pool but I liked this one better as I remember the Orleans kiddie pool was kinda tainted yellow and you know what that means... While the sun was out, it was kinda chilly there due to the breeze that kept flowing thru. I think since this hotel is all by itself, there isn't much protection from the wind as you might get along the strip with all those hotels bunched together. Kids had a great time swimming. Wish they had a slide or lazy river. Used the on site movie theater but didn't use the bowling alley with 60+lanes. We checked out the kids tyme area where they charge $6per hr per kid. We were hesitant on leaving our kids there but after touring the center and speaking to the staff, my wife let the kids play there, albeit with her sitting in the waiting area to keep an eye on things. Kids had a great time there too. There's a rock climbing wall, a very expansive human habittrail (like chuck e. cheese) with slides, a small movie theater (big tv w/ dvd library), craft center and snack bar where you can leave $ for the kids to buy things or preselect a snack for them. Best part was the staff to kid ratio...there were only 10 kids there and 4-5 staff at the time. They were the 'grandmotherly' type and assured us that no adults are allowed in the play area without an escort so it's safe. Food was just OK at the lunch buffet. Dinner at Miguel's was very good but service was very poor. We had a waitress that must've walked by our table 5 times when we were trying to get our bill. When we finally did leave to pay, another couple near our table had the same experience. Breakfast at the cafe was excellent. 24 hr steak special was very good especially since it was comped. I'm not a big $ player but they didn't have a problem comping me for the cafe for 4 of us so that was nice. We enjoyed our stay as it's a nice place to stay with kids. However, it is a ways from the strip or any other major casino/hotel. The only other negative related to that is there isn't a freeway exit close. Nearest exit is 2 miles before and after. Be nice if they had one that funneled right into the hotel.", "Date": "May 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reno, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cfantastic place to stay\u201d", "Author": "harrahs", "ReviewID": "UR5229162", "Content": "Stayed at the South Coast for one night before the journey home, the place is great from the service to the rooms, arrived on a sunday May 21.
