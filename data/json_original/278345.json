It does however have a major problem in that the rooms are not well noise insulated, We were in a room facing Via del Corso which was very noisy (nightly rubbish collection, groups of loud people etc) but we also had the misfortune to be located next door to the most inconsiderate couple who started their day around 7.30am with a huge row which went on for at least 2 hours despite my husband banging on the wall and me complaining to reception. They also chain smoked i their room and the smell came in to our room and the corridor via the air con - after 4 nights we were glad to come home. I am sure that this however does not happen all the time - but if we ever return to this hotel I would be quicker to ask for another room. The breakfast was chaotic between 9.30 and 10.15 - possibly due to the lack of anyone taking charge. The variety of cold food was adequate but since a lot of the guests were English, it may have been nice to have some hot food supplied as well, Having said that - it could make for more complaints as they didn't seem to be able to cope with what they are currently offering. There is a pleasant bar on the first floor which has a couple of computers for the guests to use, This is very useful as we could print off our boarding cards and check in on line etc, The downside of this first floor bar is that it is very close to the first floor bedrooms and I am sure that if they have the same insulation as we did, then they didn't get to sleep early each evening, We asked the hotel about a taxi to the airport and was told they had a special deal with a taxi company and would arrange one for 48euros, Since we only paid 40euros to get to the hotel we walked up to the Spanish Steps (3 mins) and got one from the taxi rank at 40euros", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGood choice!!\u201d", "Author": "pallinime", "ReviewID": "UR124375642", "Content": "+ A GREAT location in the heart of the city!

Being on the first floor, we did not get direct sunshine in, and the apartment was a bit dark, but keeping the curtains off it was ok. The apartment was just enough for 2 adults and 2 children. The kitchenette was small but workable, with dishwasher (take your own tablets with you), a refrigerator and a microwave, but we didn\u00b4t dare to use the gas oven as we are used to an electric one. There was no brush for washing the dishes, but we didn\u00b4t need one. There was a laptop with some restrictions in where it let you go (some pdfs weren\u00b4t allowed, such as a pdf of Roman tram routes), and a cell phone to use when you needed to contact the main hotel. There were 2 LCD TVs, one in the bedroom and one in the livingroom, and the latter one had a SKY connection, so there were plenty to watch in case of a rainy day (TV heaven for our children who didn\u00b4t mind that almost everything had been dubbed into Italian). The beds were OK to sleep, but the bed in the bedroom was a bit short for us (187 cm and 178 cm). The bathroom was very nice, but there was a tiny smell of mould there. But it had a fan to take the moisture off and an electric drying line on the wall. Being October, the floors were coldish, but we had slippers. The slippers were wery much needed, as the FLOORS were also DIRTY and DUSTY, which was odd as otherwise everything was so clean in the apartment (except for some cupboards in the bedroom which we didn\u00b4t need anyway) and in the main hotel. The towels were changed every day, and the dustbins were emptied. The location of the hotel and the aparment was excellent, with just 100 metres to the Spanish steps and the metro station there. Across the narrow street of Vittoria there was a music school, so at times you were able to listen to some excellent classical music played or sung. 50 metres down the Vittoria street there was a tiny Carrefour supermarket and everywhere there were bars, restaurants, pizzerias... Despite the central location it was very peaceful at night, not a sound outside until morning when the maintenance people started their work. The breakfast was great, every day the same, but with a lot of variety so you didn\u00b4t get bored. The ladies were so friendly there. Upon request it was possible to get a cup of cappuccino or some other special coffee. The service at the hotel desk was also very nice, they would do your bookings for you (to museums for example).

We visited all the obvious.. Colosseo,Piazza Di Spagna, Il Foro, Basilica Di San Pietro, Pantheon, Fontana di Trevi, Piazza Navona,as well as Basilica Di San Giovanni..Amazing!, Basilica Di San Clemente ( A Church built on top of another Church dating back 2000 years!) Bocca del la Verita' ( mouth of Truth) and the star in my opinion.. Galleria Borghese! Do not leave Rome without visiting this amazing collection of sculptures from Bernini and paintings from Carravaggio, Raffalele and Titian ( Booking must be made B4). All these places can be visited within walking distance. The Mozart may not be the cheapest Hotel in Rome but what you save in Taxi fares ( and they do add up!!) makes up for it.

The ONLY slight downside was that our beautiful window + shutters opened out facing a wall, also the wifi connection was very erratic. But these are small issues. I would have to say the best thing about these rooms was the fact that you feel you have your own apartment in the city, the rest of the building is made up of apartments and you share a gorgeous communal entrance which opens onto the high street.

The rooms were a decent size for Rome, seemed to have been recently refurbished with lovely shower rooms. We had problems getting the tv to work but I think that was us and not that it wasn't working as we eventually figured it out on the second day!

The laptop probably would have worked if we could have been bothered enough to speak to someone about it, but we didn't really need it so it was fine. They also have two computers for use on the 1st floor in Hotel Mozart which worked fine and even has a printer to print your boarding passes! The roof top terrace was a nice touch, we did go there a few times and the lady working there was really helpful and nice. This was my third time in Rome and without a doubt the best location, right in the middle of it all, and can walk to Colosseum in about half an hour if you can take the scorching sun at this time of year. The breakfast room in Vivaldi was very cute, the decor really matched the rest of the building and good selection of fresh fruits, yogurts, breads as well as cereal and cold meats. The home made cakes and cookies were very welcome! There were some really small things that could have been better, like the wifi working and the shower seemed to drain quite slowly, but this would definitely not stop me recommending this hotel whole heartedly. oh, and book a ticket for the Vatican museum - the queues are just too long!

We wanted more space than a hotel room since we were travelling with our seven-year-old, but we also wanted a homey place rather than something too fancy-schmancy for the same reason. The Vittoria apartment was perfect. It was very homey, like staying at grandma's in Brooklyn, rustic style wood furniture - but with free internet and Sky TV! (SpongeBob in Italian was a big hit!) There's a living room/dining area, kitchenette with a fridge, toaster-oven, and stove - but ask them how to work it 'cause we couldn't figure it out! (no microwave) A bedroom with major closets and drawers, and a bathroom with shower and even a bidet! There's a fantastic air conditioner in the bedroom, but the one in the living room stubbornly would'nt work - they tried to fix it and even brought in an electrician! But it was kaput, so they brought us a nice powerful fan, which worked out great. They even got us an alarm clock because the beds were so comfy and the windows kept the place so dark we never knew what time of day it was! The hotel front desk staff was AMAZING, as were the bellmen - they went out of their way to accomodate anything we needed, from fixing the AC, making a restaurant reservation, getting us Roma Passes, etc., etc. And always with a smile. I cannot stress enough how friendly and caring everyone was! Even the gals at the buffet breakfast - though busy, busy - were friendly. The food was replenished frequently so it was always fresh - even though we got there near the end! Coffee, tea, toast, croissants, quiche (yum!), boiled eggs, tarts, milk, juices, fruit, veggies, yogurts, cereal, cold cuts & cheese... and the breakfast room was lovely! And I should also mention that right across from the Vittoria apartment is a music school, so every day we were serenaded with opera singers and musicians practising - magical! The location is beautiful - a little cobblestone street just off the Via del Corso, surrounded by some terrific restaurants, shopping and sites. There's even a little grocery store just down the block - convenient for getting Cheerios and milk to take back to the apt! So here's the scoop: if you're looking for a super-lux experience, go to the Hassler, the Russie or the Excedra. But if you want an authentic Roman experience, the Mozart's Vittoria apartment is a great place to stay!

For further afield the Spagna metro is close at hand. We have visited Rome many times but now always stay at this apartment. It is very spacious, nicely appointment with plenty of starge space. A previous reviewer said there was no heating, this is not the cae, there is heaters in both the lounge and the bedroom, operated by remote control.

The breakfast is very good for this price of hotel & I always find it sets us up for the day. I like the home-made quiche & pastries they have. Not the healthiest option but we do walk it off all day! The apartment does not come equipt with a kettle or wine glasses. Both essential in my view. One of the breakfast ladies (they are ultra helpful & nice) quickly provided me with the wine glasses but it took longer to get a kettle although the front desk did set us up with one the next day. I have to say, I have seen a deterioration in the front desk staff over the years since the first visit. It's not bad but just that they were really good then but now it is a bit more of an effort. Also, I have to agree they do not acknowledge returning guests (or their special occasions, like special anniversaries, birthdays etc).

The Vivaldi Apartments is actually 1/2 a block away from the Hotel Mozart. When we first booked this room I thought this distance might be a problem but it was none at all. The best thing about this hotel is the location. Its very well situated on the Via del Corso. Right on a busy shopping boulevard and a short walk from the Spanish Steps. When the windows were closed, I had no issues with noise even though the apartment was only one flight up. The worst thing about the hotel is the attitude from the front desk check in staff. Any time I dealt with them I got the distinct impression that they felt they were doing me a favor to even look up no less help me. It made me feel very uncomfortable. That said, I didn't get that same impression from the staff I dealt with that came to our room for various reasons. So I pressume its just the front desk staff that have this issue. The room itself is quite nice and well decorated. The large bedroom and adjoining bathroom is spacious and well appointed. The second bedroom and bath is much smaller but large enough for our purposes. The middle sitting room serves its purpose to eat breakfast, etc. If someone were planning on using that as a bedroom, it would make eating there very difficult as there would be no common area so keep that in mind. The closet turned into a kitchenette came in handy. No stove to cook but a little fridge to store cold foods and drinks. There are televisions in both bedrooms and sitting rooms. There is a single sky cable box for the apartment which means only one of us got to enjoy any programming at one time. On the positive side there is a DVD player in each room so if you'd like some rainy day entertainment, you could bring or buy DVDs. Another issue we had throughout our stay was that the cable would go out every once in a while. Not a big issue except for the fact that the telephone and internet service would go down when that would happen. We found the internet connection to be virtually unusable throughout our stay. If it had been working properly, that would have been a nice touch. A nice breakfast of coffee, croissant, cereal and fruit was served to us each day.

Take that into account if you are carrying a large and/or heavy bag. Once inside, the hotel is very pleasant, but the room I asked for- a double for single use, overlooking an internal courtyard (number 322)- meant that one had to go up and down some small staircases, and without help from a bellboy, it would have been a bit difficult. Also, the courtyard was actually the back of a neighboring house. I was lucky to see a terrace covered with plants and flowers, but it could also have had laundry hanging out. The room was a decent size, had good hanging space, but one thing lacking was the absence of proper drawer space.Nor was there a full length mirror in the room, only 2 three quarter length mirrors. One other thing that was strange were the rather old fashioned telephones, which didn't allow for a flashing message sign or voice mail. Since cellphones do not work at all in the hotel, one must use the land line.Lastly, the lighting was not very good, so much so that one evening I selected a pair of tights thinking they were black, and only when I got outside did I discover they were purple! But now for the good parts: the room was generally comfortable,particularly the bed, which had an excellent mattress, though the pillows were a bit too soft for my liking. The bathroom, which had a laundry line in the shower, always a great convenience, was a nice size and had good amenities/ The hotel has a marvelous roof garden, open only in the summer, but I was able to see it, and enjoy the amazing view over the city.In the winter, there is a lovely lounge and bar available in the afternoon and evenings with comfortable couches, a tv, newspapers, internet point, and generally a very cozy atmosphere. There is also a little cafe/restaurant attached to the hotel, called La Luna d'Oro, which many people from the neighborhood frequent. It is open till 9 pm, and they give a small discount to hotel guests. The breakfast room is decorated in pale green and the staff even wear shirts to match, to complete the feeling of cool charm. The choice for breakfast is fairly good, but, as a vegetarian, it would have been nice to have smoked sliced salmon and not just sliced meat available.By Italian standards it was a very nice breakfast, with fresh fruits and vegetables available besides the usual bread, cereal and pastry fare. What was very nice was the fact that at the buffet table each person could fill a whole tea/coffeee pot and take it to the table, thus having enough without having to bother to get up or ask the staff. The hotel also provides another room in the basement with 3 internet points, all for use without payment. The one thing that is confusing is the separation of 2 different elevators for different floors. The staff was courteous, but I cannot say that they went out of their way to be extremely helpful, and that despite the fact that I speak fluent Italian and have no problem of communication.

We actually like the hotel and location very much, but have decided that the snooty front desk people are just inexcusable. This has been a complaint from many people who have reviewed this hotel in the past, but we always chose to excuse their behavior because we loved the hotel itself. We just returned from a week long trip to Tuscany and stayed at The Mozart for two nights before our flight home. During this and our last several stays, we have stayed in the Vivaldi Suites, which we like very much. They are always spotless and the bathrooms are very nice and modern. The first thing we always do is turn on the air conditioner and this time, we found the motor sounded like a jet taking off. We decided that this was not acceptable and called the desk to see if there was another room. They replied that they were totally booked, but would send someone to check it out. We didn't leave the room for several hours and as far as we know, no one ever came to look at it. Once the room cooled down, we kept it on low and it was better, but still rather loud. I must admit that we have never found the front desk help overly friendly, but as long as they did their job and we liked the hotel, we tolerated their aloofness. When we arrived, our room was not ready and they said it would only take twenty minutes, so we waited right there in the lobby where they could see us. After half an hour, my husband asked if our room was ready and the guy looked at him like he didn't know what he was talking about and asked what our name was. I think what has always irritated me the most over the years, was how they NEVER once acknowedged that we had stayed there before. Most hotels say, \"Welcome Back Mr. and Mrs. so and so,\" but they have never said a word. I actually think that is very rude, especially after half a dozen stays or more and the terrific reviews I have given them on Trip Advisor. Lastly, when we were checking out, my husband asked if they could give him change for the driver and the guy said in a very rude manner, \"I don't have change.\" I think that nailed the coffin shut as far as we were concerned. Let me add, that almost every single one of these people has worked there for as long as we have stayed there, so these aren't untrained people. I think we have probably stayed with them more than any other guest, so a little warmth would have been nice. So, when we return to Rome, we will no longer consider The Mozart.

When I complained, they put us in a room in the hotel. Next, I realize there is a tub only and the shower nozzle was completely broken. I went right back downstairs to complain again and they looked at me like I was crazy and said \"you mean to tell us that you wanted a room with a shower?\" I said YES!, I want a room with a shower. So now they put us in a room below their rooftop bar and assured me that it wouldn't be too noisy after 12:30am because the party being held there should be done with by then.

The Hotel Mozart was a lovely hotel with lots of charm in a perfect location just round the corner from the Spanish Steps and Metro station. We could walk to most attractions from there. Getting around was easy. We bought a 3 day pass for Metro which also allowed us to use buses in that time. Taxi's can only be got from Taxi ranks, but these are in all the popular spots. Rough guide cost wise : It cost us 8 euros from Spanish Steps to Termini Station. St Peters Square to Hotel was 12 Euros. Our room was clean with well equipped bathroom. a little small, but not enough to bother us. Room had kettle and vrious teas/coffee facilities. Also had a stocked mini bar, TV with Sky (some channels were able to be switched from Italian to English language-some not), DVD player and various toiletries. Continental breakfast included , with cereals, toast, pastries, meat,cheese, fruit, yoghurt etc. Reception staff very friendly. would recommend. one little tip - we were a bit wary at first for fear of being ripped off, but if you go to the Vatican, take advantage of a tour when they come up to you in the queue. the tour was fantastic and our guide, Mike, was great. it cost us 40 euros each, but we cut the queue and went straight in, had an Australian guide and live audio guide all the way round-not pre-recorded. if we hadnt done this tour, we would have just wandered round not knowing what we were looking at and also got lost as it's huge in there! well worth the money. one more thing, when eating out, they give you a bread basket. if you eat any of it, you will be charged, but if you dont, you wont.

Additionally, the floors in the room and the halls are tile making every footstep and conversation audible to all residents on the floor.

A car picked us up from the airport (arranged by the hotel) with no problem. A previous poster was right about the check-in - not overly friendly. usually i don't mind however after a long flight and in a foreign country, you want to feel welcomed at your hotel. Upon entering the room, there was a horrible smell of ammonia (i suppose from cleaning the room). we had to leave the windows open the whole day in order to get the smell out. The room was an okay size, small by american standards but i suppose okay for european rooms. the first night i wanted to use the computer to notify family that we had arrived. well, the computer would not allow sign in to any email accounts. i asked the front desk and he said the technician wouldn't be back until monday (this was saturday). later that evening we asked again, and we were told there is another computer room downstairs with 3 computers... and those worked fine. it would have been to know about this room when we checked in, or told about it when i complained about the other computer not working. we also had a problem with the shower. the drain would not drain and kept clogging up, so that every couple minutes in the shower i had to turn the water off to let it drain and then put it back on. We notified the front desk several times, several times they told us it was fixed, however it never was (nor was there any evidence that they came or fixed anything). This was a bit annoying, as after a long day of touring i look forward to a nice long shower, and this could not happen without flooding the bathroom. At breakfast, the selection was typical - rolls, croissants, jellies, some fruit. However you had to ask one of the women to order a cappucino, and i felt you had to flag them down as they were running around the breakfast room. they didn't seem thrilled when you asked for one, and they do not ask you if you'd like anything when you arrive. the first day we were polite and waited to be asked, and then realized that no one was going to ask us so we had to get their attention ourselves. The hotel's location is probably the best thing it has going for it - minutes away from the spanish steps and right on via del corso. however be careful, because our room faced via del corso and it was pretty noisy all day (if in the room) and at night as well. i suppose they have rooms that face the back but we weren't in one of those. the front desk was helpful once you started talking to them, but not overly friendly.

We arrived around 11am and room was ready. Check-in was professional but not overly friendly. Bell-man took us to the room which was on the top floor. He then promptly brought the bags up after. We booked a Deluxe Room. Room was very spacious with two beds pushed together into one, forming a king. There were two balconies, one huge one off of the bed area with a table, two chairs, umbrella, and two lounge chairs. (One lounge chair had a broken arm though and the umbrella was completely ratty and worn out.) It looked down onto the Via Del Corso. The other balcony was smaller off of the bathroom and had the rear view from the hotel out to the Villa Borghese. There was central A/C, a large plasma/LCD type TV with satellite channels and DVD player (PAL not NTSC), mini-bar, in-room coffee/tea set-up, and ample drawer space and large closet. Bathroom was large with multi-head shower/jacuzzi tub and bidet. Room was clean save for a line of mildew that was growing at the top of the shower. Bed was very comfortable and A/C worked well. The only note with that is the room's power is controlled by your room key. When you leave, you have to take the key out of the outlet which turns off all power. So you may come back to the room being hot and have to wait for it to cool off again. Hotel has an odd layout. You have to take an elevator or stairs up one flight from the lobby, then cross over through the lounge to find a second elevator to get to higher floors. It seemed like it might be difficult for a handicapped individual to get around. Breakfast buffet is included and it was okay. There were breads, cakes, pastries, fruit, and some meats and cheese. Some hot items would've been nice though. You can also get room service breakfast for an additional cost. There is a large two-level roofdeck with wonderful views. We didn't use that often since we had our own balcony. There was a bar on the roofdeck. We had a free welcome drink included with our room so we went up one evening to use it. We had been up before and it was a very relaxing atmosphere with nice background music and people relaxing and chatting. This time though there was a surly young man working the bar who had music blasting. He seemed annoyed by the presence of hotel guests and barked at us when we went to redeem the drink coupon that it was only good for the house drink (we already knew that since it was printed on the coupon). We were fine with that and the drink was a mimosa. We didn't stay long due to his attitude and the loud music. We went down to the lower level of the deck and the music could not be heard as much there. We noticed other guests clustered in that area. Normally everyone crowds to the top roofdeck area from previous stops by we saw, so I assume they were bothered by the music like we were. Internet service is available for free. They have a few computers you can use. . You can also go wireless and use your own laptop with a password they issue you (expires every 24 hours), but only in the public areas like the lounge. It will not work in guest rooms. There was an issue with this though. The passwords for the internet are printed at the front desk and can only be viewed through the print out. The printer broke while we were there so we were unable to get a second password after the first one expired so we could not get access through our laptop. The hotel is located in one of the better areas of the city, near The Spanish Steps. There were numerous shops (many high-end like Tiffany, Chanel, Armani, etc.) and restaurants around. Desk clerk made a restaurant recommendation one evening for a nice little place called Op La just a few blocks away. Food was pretty good, but it was pricey for what you got. It was also funny because nearly all the diners in the restaurant were also staying at our hotel as we recognized them. I would guess that the desk clerk is getting a nice kick-back. We actually had a better meal at a nice place called Ristorante Alla Rampa, closer to The Spanish Steps. Hotel arranged an airport transfer for us in a private car which was there promptly. Cost was about 60 Euro. Overall this was a very nice property and based on the prices in Rome and current exchange rates was worth the price.

I knew from experience that hotels in Europe are usually quite small and not what we are used to in Canada or US.

This place was nicer and more comfortable than home!! The staff really went out of their way to make our Christmas away from home memorable. They offered to make reservations for us for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day because many restaurants were closed for the holidays. They made sure to send us to a nice enough restaurant, but one that also was family friendly. The suite (room 612) was very large, one king size bed, one day bed and one decent size cot. All very comfortable with nice linens. The bathroom was to die for!! Better than any master bath I've seen in some posh homes!! Robes, slippers, wonderful bath products. There was a nice sized desk with a laptop computer with free internet access 24/7. The huge plasma satellite TV across from the bed was my husband's favorite feature. The breakfast served every morning was enough to feed a family of 10. On Christmas morning, the breakfast was even more lavish than usual and the woman who served it to the room had included candies and chocolates for the kids. You cannot find a better location. It is right on the main shopping street, with the Trevi Fountain, The Spanish Steps, and all major tourist attractions about 5-10 minutes away. There was a small grocery store across the street, down a small alley way that we went to some nights to get quick snacks and drinks for the kids. The Turkish Bath (steam room) was down the hall from our room and my husband loved it. Everything in the place was pristine.

I'm not sure which was worse, the surly staff (including the rude bellman) or the filthy room. We have traveled to Europe multiple times and since the Mozart was charging us $275 Euros for a \"superior\" room I expected something spartan but clean. Not so. The room stank like cigarettes - as if no one had aired it out in centuries. It was filthy - there was a thick layer of dust on the bedside table, along with several strands of hair. And the staff was unhelpful. We asked to move that first day but were told there was nothing comparable available for the first night. The surly desk seargant told me we could move to another superior room the next day. In the morning, I asked to be moved but was told by a different surly receptionist that there was nothing available. The only thing available was a suite at the \"luxury\" Vivaldi Suites across the hotel. Aha, I thought. This would be great. A better room at the same price. I could barely keep up with the bellman as he sprinted around the corner to show me the room. It was horrid. There was a dirty ashtray in the middle of the bed with cigarette butts, it stank to high heaven and it was darker than night, even though it was 8 a.m. We did not move. We could not find other accommodations because everything was booked. We left the windows open and hoped that the room would smell better after airing out for a day and being cleaned. Not so. It smelled horrible that evening and the hairs were still on the bedside table, along with the dust. We have just returned home and ALL of our clothes smell like cigarettes. I have stayed in many European cities and am used to smokers, but I find it inconceivable that a hotel would let its rooms stink so badly and that it wouldn't employ maids to sweep dust off one of the TWO tables in the room.

So much so, that this October 2006, I will again be staying at the Mozart. The hotel stay included a welcoming drink on their rooftop terrace, and a generous help yourself varied breakfast. Mozart is situated down a narrow side cobblestone street. It's a few doors from the Via de Corso, (Rome's trendy shopping area) which closes to cars in the evening for pedestrian traffic. We saw all the normal wonderful sites and did so by walking. So the Mozart is in a perfect location. For the experience, we chose to take the bus from the airport to the hotel. We wanted to see what life was like for the local Italians. This trip involved two buses at 1 euro each bus, as compared to the return car ride back to the airport at 65 euros. The first day the three of us (one 35 y.o. and two 60 y.o.) walked to the colosseum, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, etc. Day two St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Museum. The Pope can be seen (if he's in town) on Sunday at noon, or Wednesday mornings at 10 (if it's real hot) or normally at 11 o'clock. We did eat at Edy's (recommended in a Trip Advisor review) one night and found it very disappointing. The second night the hotel recommended a restaurant close by (can't remember the name) which has a wall with three shelves full of antipasto, in which you can help yourself or order from a menu. The staff here was wonderful as was the food. The pizza is to die for - very different from what we call pizza, as is the gelatto.

(very small - approx 9' x 10'). The bedspread was so stained and disgusting that we used a shoe horn to remove it from the bed. The pillows were as thick as few dish towels put together. We immediatly asked if there were any other rooms available and were told no. We asked to have the room cleaned and the bedspread replaced and we were ignored. We had to get out of there, not only for some fresh air but were hungry and figured that would give them some time to clean. Nothing was done and the personel were very uncaring. Needless to say, we did not sleep well at all!! We are a well traveled family and have been to Europe many times as well as the UK, Canada, and various tropical islands etc..etc.. We expect to see very small rooms since the history of most buildings in Italy, France, Ireland or wherever add to the charm and site-seeing shold be your main agenda anyway. What is revolting about this property is the lack of cleanliness, the snobbish disregard for customer service and a breakfast that was a bowl of canned pineapple, coffee and bread. What a buffet !! By all means - skip the Hotel Mozart completely. Other reviews talk about location, location, location but given the hundreds of other opportunites of places to stay in the Eternal City - Look Elsewhere. We traveled throughtout five regions of Italy during 2 weeks. Venezia, Firenza, Tuscany, Positano and Rome. All our hotels were within 220.00 and 250.00 euros. All our accommidations (which were rated 4 stars), except for the Mozart, were really wonderful so it is very possible if you have the right planning, to have spacious rooms, friendly personnel, and a terrific breakfast to start your daily experience.

The Hotel was just three or so short blocks from the Metro station (with a great Pizza place right outside of the entrance on the Metro... Soo good!). Just the walk from the Metro to the Hotel was great. Walking down old cobblestone streets with outdoor cafe's and high-end shopping stores was beautiful. The Hotel entrence itself is located down a little side street. A very nice lobby, with very friendly staff brought us right up to our room. We had a large room in the front looking over the street below. Two big windows with woden shutters opened up to the sights and sounds below. The noise was not a problem as we are city people, however, I must note that there is a Hospital right across the street. You will hear Ambulance sirens. This could be disterbing to people who are light sleepers. This was not a problem for us, and we laughed at the uniqueness of the sirens. Our room was big, beautiful, and comfertable. The Bathroom was all marble, spotless, and big! The large plasma TV was great, and the free internet lounge downstairs was always empty (Three terminals, plus printer). The breakfast was the normal fare, some breads, some jams, some meats. Though we really are not breakfast people we stopped by to see what they offered. The rooftop bar was beautiful, as we had a welcome cocktail before we headed out to dinner! My wife and I spent three wonderful nights of our Honeymoon at this hotel and would love to return someday!

We booked the Vivaldi Suites on the basis of the Trip Advisor reviews so thanks everyone!! We have stayed in Rome before (on a tighter budget!) and our room at the Vivaldi Suites was miles better than the non-descript Best Western we stayed in before near Termini Station. As it was our honeymoon (and we were staying for 3 nights) we got a free upgrade to the Prestige Rooms which we understand are more spacious. The room was lovely, modern (with some traditional touches), clean and the bed very comfortable. We were not facing Via del Corso but an inner courtyard with absolutely no view. That was fine as we spent most of the day out anyway but the room was quite dark and as it was only on the first floor (2nd to the American readers) didn't get much natural light even with the shutters open. We had no issues with noise from outside or the corridor! Our bathroom was of an equally high standard - very clean, modern and uncluttered with a separate shower cubicle. The jacuzzi bathtub was very welcome after a hard days sightseeing! Like some other reviewers our laptop with free internet connection didn't work. I reported it to the hotel reception on the Saturday and got a rather disinterested reply suggesting nothing could be done about it until the Monday anyway. It was never fixed and I made the observation again when we checked out on the Tuesday. It wasn't a big deal as we were on honeymoon and glad to be away from things like that (my husband wanted to check the soccer scores!) but I commented to the reception that if they are trying to use that as a selling point for potential guests then they need to make sure it works properly. One of the things we liked about Vivaldi was that you really felt you had more privacy than in a regular hotel. It felt more 'real' and as you came in and out every day it felt like you were going into your own apartment just like the locals. Breakfast delivered to the room was a nice touch although we wouldn't rave about the standard - by day 3 we'd had enough of the predictable slices of cheese and ham and some very sweet sickly pastries. The location was unbeatable and although very busy on via del Corso, a more Roman experience than many other tourist hotels in the ugly areas around Termini Station. We walked absolutely everywhere including to the Vatican and the Colesseum. Forget the metro! Lots of good restaurants close by to satisfy every taste and budget. We found a couple of good modern type pizzerias on Piazza Augusto Imperatore (Gusto and Recafe) - probably not to everyone's taste but good value and not at all touristy. There is a supermarket just round the corner from Vivaldi on via Vittoria - forget using the mini bar, we stocked up on water, beer and soft drinks from there instead and as you have a kettle in your room you could get coffee and milk as well. If you are looking for somewhere more informal than a standard hotel and something a bit less chintzy and more modern we'd definitely recommened.

Our recomendation is to arrange a taxi transfer arranged by the hotel on arrival(expensive granted but when 2 hrs delayed they were there to meet us)and take the metro and bus back which is incredibly cheap and balances the cost. Back to the hotel-our only use was to use the rooftop bar which is lovely with scented flowers but unfortunately this closed last day of Oct so we only had 1 night up there , I was a tad annoyed that on a balmy evening 1st Nov they would not open it for us.

When in Italy, if you are in your room, be sure to put the \"Do Not Disturb\" (Non Disturbare) sign outside your door.

This was our favorite hotel of our 12-day 11-night trip through Italy. The Vivaldi Suites are away from the main hotel, a short walk down the street in an apartment/condo type building. They are entered via two large wood doors between a couple of shops. It was neat - like we lived there! The room was wonderful, wood floors in the bedroom, large plasma t.v., couch, desk w/laptop to the Internet (although couldn't check our email in the States - don't know why). The bathroom was beautiful, too - enclosed shower, jacuzzi bathtub, elegant fixtures (had trouble getting hot water a couple of times in the shower, though). It was nice & quiet with the windows and shutters closed, but it didn't have a balcony and just overlooked the street (which was better than our other hotels which overlooked walls :) The rooftop bar was nice, the breakfast tray was big & served in your room just a few minutes wait after calling (of course, our room was right next door to their kitchen). For a couple of mornings, I had to use my limited Italian since the room attendant did not speak English, but that was fun, and she was nice. British Airways had lost our luggage on the way there (Rome was our first stop). The front desk clerks were very nice & helpful. They helped us call the airline a couple of times. My husband received his bag after the second night, but I did not receive mine until we got home - it had been three weeks since I had seen it last! My advice - carry on all luggage!! Most of the salesclerks in the shops were VERY unfriendly to me - which was disappointing, since I could have used a smile as I was very sad at not having any of my clothes (luckily, I had all of my non-clothing personal items in my carry-on bag). Anyway, I think a good rule of thumb is what another tripadvisor said - don't buy the cheapest room in a hotel - go at least midway or live it up with the most expensive.

The long windows opened into the internal courtyard so the room was very quiet and we didnt hear all the sounds of the Via Del Corso. The Vivaldi Suites are very close to the main hotel (literally a minute walk) which has a wonderful roof top garden where we had drinks before dinner each night (the first night drinks were on the house). Breakfast was delivered to the room about 10 minutes after the call and the tray is beautifully presented with fruit (never saw such a large peach in my life), hard boiled eggs, meats, cheeses, yogurt, and wonderful breads and cookies. You can ask for cereal and eliminate of course those items that you dont want. And dont forget the cappucino! The location of this hotel cannot be better. You are minutes to the Spanish Steps and very close to the Trevi Fountain and some wonderful restaurants. Suggest that if someone recommends the Porto di Riappeti do not go! Specializing in seafood (they say it is fresh) we were very disappointed in the food (flavorless to bad) and the service (dont let the owner fool you, he does a great sales job but once he is gone the waiter is very unfriendly). On the other hand had a great meal at the Brasserie de la buvette on Via Vittoria (a block or two from the hotel) and another at a hotel recommended restaurants on Via Riappeti. We tried the much touted San Crispino Gelati near the Trevi Fountain and were disappointed.

Sadly, this was my least favorite out of the 5 hotels we stayed at on our trip. When we checked in the first night, we were given an extremely small room with a queen size bed. We had booked a room with two twin beds, but were told they had no more rooms (by the way, it's room number 310 - okay if you're travelling alone, or don't have a lot ot luggage). The gentleman working at the front desk was not very nice, and treated us like we should have been happy with the room we got. Luckily, the next day another gentleman was working at the front desk, and we were moved to another larger room with twin beds. The room was okay, but loud because of it's location (room number 304) which was right over Via del Corso street. It was definitely better than the first room. Good points about this hotel: location (near the Piazza di Spagna and the Piazza Del Popolo), good buffet breakfast, nice reading room, rooftop bar, and free internet service. Bad points: service was iffy (one front desk staff member was not helpful and condescending, the others were fine), room and bathroom were not that clean, rooms need to be updated. We based our decision to stay here from the reviews on this website. I've read more bad reviews lately, so I guess it's just the luck of the draw. Overall, I don't think I'd stay at this hotel again when I go back to Rome. Recommendations: *EDY restaurant about three blocks from the hotel (they can give you directions at the hotel) - great food and service (not touristy) *Ristorante Barberini - at Piazza Barberini (Via della Purificazoione 21) - wonderful, family-run restaurant - great food and service *Il Gelato Di San Crispino (Via della Panetteria 42 - near the Trevi Fountain) - fantastic gelato! *Get reservations on-line for the Galleria Borghese and the Colosseum at the SelectItaly.com website.

As for location, via dei Greci is a very quiet street (especially in comparison with via del Corso) and it is not a \"long dark alley\" as someone has described it. If you wanna go shopping the location is great (all famous boutiques are situated in 5-10 minutes walking distance). But if you plan to go sightseeing a lot, maybe it's better to choose a hotel closer to Panteon and Pl. Venezia (it would be easier to get to Vatican, Trastevere and some other districts).

The rooms were very clean, quiet and it was great to have the laptop and the plasma TV. My teenagers were fascinated! WHATEVER YOU DO IN ROME DO NOT TAKE THE 110 TRAMBUS!

I can't say anything about the main hotel (right off the reception area). I should also inform you that in order to get to one's room you must hike up a few flights of stairs. I did not mind, in fact I much prefer. I did see a small elevator, but it looked to me more like a service elevator. The breakfast tray that the nice housekeeper's bring to your room is a decent way to start your day.

We stayed at Mozart for four nights at the end of July, the first stage of our honeymoon. We were dropped off by our taxi about 15 metres from the front door of the hotel and were quickly met by the concierge who took my wife's case from her and into the hotel. Admittedly arriving in the dark, the hotel doesn't look great from outside - however once inside all is well. The staff were very nice and were keen to help. They recommended an excellent little restaurant - Op La - which was only three streets away and did some wonderful food. We stayed in room 506 on the fifth floor. We did have to get two lifts and walk a little to get there, but it was more than worth it. The bedroom was simple but very nice, with a great Plasma screen TV (Didn't really get watched, but looked the part!), mini bar and rather nice Alessi kettle. The air con was excellent and very very welcome relief from the city heat. The bathroom was a good size and had a jacuzzi and excellent shower. There was also a door off the bathroom onto a small terrace. The best bit about our room was the main roof terrace. Two sets of French doors opened onto this private balcony, which was well equipped with two sun loungers, table, chairs and a parasol. The terrace was a lovely way to relax late afternoon each day following a hard day touring the sites. This was finished off perfectly by the busking saxonphonist whose music drifted onto the terrace each afternoon. Breakfast was served in a nicely decorated room, and the offering was very good, with a good selection of bread, cheeses, meat, juices etc - a good standard all round. There was a small issue about the close proximity of the tables and there was a risk of sitting facing another couple, however this only happened to us once and the fact they did not speak English was a bonus as it meant we didn't have to speak to them! The roof terrace bar was excellent. We started each of our evenings here with a glass of Chianti, watching the sun setting over the church across the road. The lady working in the bar was very nice to us, and was always offering crisps/nuts etc with our drinks. Drinks were fairly reasonably prices for a hotel in the centre of a capital city. The position of Mozart is perfect - it is right on the Via Del Corso and is right in the middle of the main sites; the Vatican is a short walk one way and the Colosseum a shorter walk the other. The internet point in the lounge was also helpful, although it proved expensive for me as it told my wife when Tiffanys was open!!

We weren't there 4 hours until the elevator went out and stayed out the entire time we were there - 3 days. After a long, hot day of walking in Rome, we dreaded going back to the hotel. Our room was dirty, dark and smelled consistently of sewer gas, especially the bathroom where we could barely breathe while dressing. We had to leave the windows open, which made for much noise, some bugs and was unsettling. The room safe was a loose box in the bottom of the closet. I suppose we could have used it, but then someone could have easily just carried the box off. We consistently reported these things to the staff who just looked at us, shrugging their shoulders.

It really was that good !!!!!! Believe the reviews First, I recommend getting the airport car pick up. It was a little more money, but it was worth it after a long and hot trip. A cab was about 50 Euro to/from the airport ( what some people we met on the rooftop bar told us ) and the car was 65 to pick us up and on the return to the airport it was 53 Check in was pretty easy. The porter was tied-up so our favorite guy at the Desk ( Cesidio ) sent us up to the rooftop bar for our welcome drink, and we decided to stay for a few more since the view at 6 PM was so nice. When we came down our bags had been delivered to our room. Later that night we met the conceriege at the restaurant he's recommended. Can't remember the name of that particular restaurant but the guy there was called Mr Georgio. It was a nice restaurant. I really enjoyed the fettucini with truffle sauce. GREAT ROOM !!!! We were in 610 which overlooked the via del corso. Really big ( and very clean ) bathroom. Actually it was bigger than most bathrooms in US hotels, and much nicer too. Great hardwood floors with a big plasma. The bed was nice and actually comfortable. AC made it as cold as you wanted. The best part was or course the laptop in the room. The internet connection was fast, like computer modem speed but about 10% slower. Still it was the fastest I saw in all of Italy. I even posted a few times on this forum, and when I had a question about left luggage at FCO I posted the question from my room right to TA forum and had an answer when we returned from dinner and drinks. Very nice to be able to have that feature. Breakfast was OK. The pastiries were hot. THe butter was cold and the juice was fresh and cold.the coffee was good too. I saw some people complain that it got boring after a few days. Ok go downstairs to the little snack bar, which has the exact type of coffee and pastries for 10 euro! We stayed out so late every night that we slept through two breakfasts ( or was it three ) The cute girl that delivered it was just as fast as I had read on this forum ...about 7 or 8 minutes from when we called. It's nice to have your food delivered to the breakfast table by the window, especially if you are too tired to venture out MY ONE COMPLAINT which has nothing to do with the Mozart ( it turns out that this was in all 4 hotels we stayed at in Italy....must be an Italian thing ) was no ironing board or iron in the room. Try landing in a city where you like to dress up at night, and have wrinkled clothes! Might I suggest taking a travel steamer to Italy. Still we were able to get stuff laundered or pressed ( for 5 euro which was pretty standard price ) Our maid did our clothes and had them same day. She was really great. I spent about 3 months on various forums looking at places to stay. While in Rome I had a chance to wander around and check out a few of the other hotels I had looked at. Basically, we'll stay at the Vivaldi suites for every other trip we take to Rome. They were really perfect, and awfully cheap considering the 10% discount we got for booking 5 or more nights. 5 minutes walk to Piazza del poppolo and spanish steps. 10 min to pantheon and Giolitti. I can't comment on the main hotel except for the rooftop bar. The rooftop bar was really nice. Great view of some big bassilica nearby. Drinks were nice. I had read on one review that a person had recommended dinner at the rooftop of Valentino's hotel because the rooftop had great views. Well we went up there to valentino's for a drink one afternoon and that view ---- compared to the view on top of the mozart. BEWARE IN ROME : Not much in terms of late night dining.

There is also a nice Piano bar downstairs to Valentinos with live music and dancing.... but watch out for the drinks prices! first drink 15 Euro! and then 10 Euro a drink after that.

Her costs were competitive with the big companies, but it was nice to be 4 in a Mercedes mini-van with a guide who personalized the experience. Marina used drama to make the tours interesting. she even stood in the Vatican line and had us to arrive later so we didn't have to wait.

We took a Vastour recommended by Hotel Mozart one night and it was awful....not to say almost $200 for the 4 of us for 2 hours. When the guide was not talking with the driver, she seemed to be reading from a script, only she left off several important details, like the entire Trevi Fountain. She couldn't tell us when it had been erected or for what purpose. We calculated that in realiy the tour really last about 45 minutes when you factor in pick up, pay, load bus, delay the start of tour, circle the same monument 3 times, spend 5 minutes walking to Trevi fountain, 15 minutes there with no details given, 5 minutes back to bus.

The location is ideal and within alking access to the major sites.", "Date": "October 19, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cVivaldi Luxury Rooms: PERFECT!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2755951", "Content": "We stayed in a suite in the Vivaldi Luxury Rooms, everything in the room was fantastic. Well decorated and proportioned bathroom. The bathroom had a Jacuzzi tub and separate shower. The room itself was spacious, with a King bed, lounge sofa, desk and a small table for breakfast. A plasma screen was on the wall. The breakfast is served in the room each day within 15 minutes and was always on-time and fantastic. We even ordered breakfast at 12 noon the day after we arrived!!! How is that for service. There is also a roof terrace bar which is perfect for having a beer at the end of the day and watching the sun go down. Hotel location is also perfect, very close to the Spanish steps. There is nothing I can fault about this hotel and would definitely stay again.....", "Date": "October 18, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Princeton, NJ", "Title": "\u201cVivaldi Suites - best in Italy\u201d", "Author": "TravelingPro", "ReviewID": "UR2755131", "Content": "Just back from a 16 day trip to Italy with (3) days in the Vivaldi Suites. As others have stated, these accomodations are simply the best you'll find in Rome for the price paid. Truly 5 star quality for a 3-4 star price. A private enclave of extremely well appointed rooms within walking distance to most attractions. Only suggestion would be to avoid the Ristorante EDY that the friendly front desk recommends. We asked for a good local trattoria that wasn't touristy. . . we ended up dining with the other guests of Hotel Mozart as this appears to be an extension of the hotel. The night we were there, the front desk clerk sat down for dinner at the table next to us and was obviously a frequent diner there. Much better local restaraunt (without many tourists) is Osteria St. Ana at 68 via del Penna near Piazza del Popolo.

In Rome to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary, so we splashed the cash and stayed in the Vivaldi suites. Expensive, (even with a discount) - but worth every penny. From the Jacuzzi bath to the steam room (practically right outside our door) every aspect of the hotel made you feel special - especially being out of the main hotel in our own private enclave. We overlooked the Via Corsa, so we people watched as we ate breakfast (served in bed - on a silver salver) and slept with the blinds closed and the windows open so we could still hear the sounds of the city.

We stayed in room 610 at the Vivaldi Residence, and it was really much better then I expected, I am usually in 4 or 5 star hotels, but since I had read so many positive reviews I decided to give it a try. our room was very spacious, with plasma screen and a marble spacious bathroom, with separate shower and separate jacuzzi, which was great... the sink was big, there was a bidet, lots of little beauy products from the hotel and plenty of towels. The breakfast was served every morning in our room by a very friendly girl and the breakfast included croissants, rolls, cake, cookie, marmelade, juice, yoghurt so even though you don-t get the buffet breakfast at the vivaldi residence, breakfast is just perfect. we had a very good airco, which kept our room very cool (needless to say it was extremely hot in Rome, 34 degrees.....)

A true find in Rome! It is a renovated 1 BR apt in a neat building on Via Vittoria, a beautiful cobblestoned street lined with exclusive boutiques. The apartment was a little dark but had every ammenity including a full kitchen (there is a supermarcato down the street), 2 flat screen TVs with DVD players, a cell phone, a computer with DSL hook-up and incredible air-conditioning which is a big plus in Rome during the summer. My family of three stayed there for 176 euros a night which included free airport transfers and a very nice buffet breakfast at the Mozart. The rooftop garden of the Mozart is beuatiful and a great place to have evening drinks. The lobby of the hotel itself is a little run down, but the rooms in the new wing were large and nicely decorated. The best part of the Vittoria Suite was it made you feel as if you were living in Rome, not that you were a tourist.

We stayed in rooms 618 & 620 and there was 7 of us all together. The rooms were very elegant, clean, big and had climate control, plasma screen TV, and very comfortable huge beds. The bathrooms were very elegant and modern with slate black tiles with white and crome. There is also radio that is great in the bathrooms, and massaging jets in the bath, as well as an excellent shower. The staff were very curteous and Antonio was very helpfull indeed. They would do anything to help. The Motzart Hotel itself has an amazing roof terrace, which is very tranquil. You get a free cocktail on arrival too. The breakfast was served to your room and it was silver service. This was very handy. The ladies who serve it are very curteous as well. We were 5 mins walk from the Spanish Steps and facing the Via del Corso. We are going back again this year and staying there again as we were so impressed. We usually stay at Gleneagles Hotel, and although Vivaldi was not that standard it was a very good attempt. We would only stay there on any return trips to Rome as it is also just like having your own privacy of an apartment.
