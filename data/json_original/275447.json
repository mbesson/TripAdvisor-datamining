It is closer still to Pimlico tube station which is on the Victoria Line. The Victoria line takes you to Green Park where you can change for Piccadilly and Liecester Square or stay on for Oxford Circus. Pimlico Road is great for high end antique shops and 'Harrods' at Knightsbridge. The hotel is in one of the many, at one time, 'grand' Regency town houses that dominate the area. On arrival our room was actually ready at 11am and we were given the keys. If this had not been the case they would have allowed us to leave our luggage. The triple room was comprised of a double and single bed. It was clean and the beds fairly comfortable. The washroom was also clean and there were adequate towls. However there was only one pillow per person and further pillows were not available. The decor of the room was very 'tired' and scruffy. There were no tea making facilities or anywhere to buy something to drink which was disappointing when returning late in the evening. A big minus for us was that breakfast was only available (at the house further up the road) between 6.30pm and 8.30am and after a late night out with friends, we were unable to make such an early time. We wasted the cost of breakfast which was included. We were asked if we would like a paper for the morning but when morning came there weren't any. Finally, St. Georges Drive is quite noisy and the windows were only single glazed. In addition, there is a major building project directly across the road, (affordable housing project) and the work started before we were awake and therefore woke us up. It was very noisy from drills etc. At 90.00 pounds for the triple it was not expensive but we did not feel it was worth the money.

Very hot and powerful. The bed was relatively comfortable with adequate bedding. The TV in the room had a few channels that came in handy in the morning when getting ready. There were doubles wardrobes with mirrors, which were big enough to hold our clothes and luggage. Our room was on the top floor of the building and I must say the view we acquired was spectacular.

But I found this hotel to be perfect for my needs, which were: well-located, clean, private bathroom that worked well, affordable, wireless internet availability, breakfast included. The St. George's was all of that. Sure, the hotel has no elevator--and believe me, tramping up six STEEP flights of stairs wasn't great for this 58-year old! But it was excellent exercise and in a way I enjoyed the challenge. (They delivered my huge, overpacked suitcase to the room for me, thank goodness.) The maid was thorough and very accommodating to me and my friends who often slept or hung around the room late in the mornings and threw off her schedule. Extra towels, if we needed them, were readily available, as was a better hairdryer. Breakfast is served very early but it was absolutely fine, and the coffee was FABULOUS. Eggs are cooked to order, the staff is very accommodating and sweet (I don't know what else they could have done that they didn't.. It's a family from Colombia and they seem sincerely interested in serving and making guests comfortable.) There are some things that aren't great: the beds are not good, very worn and not supportive. The carpeting everywhere is old, too, and makes the place look sort of dirty even though it isn't--the maid is thorough about vacuuming it everywhere. The triple room we stayed in for a few nights (and then we moved to a twin after one of our party left) was so small that we had to really re-arrange stuff to be able to walk out of the place in the morning...suitcases sometimes had to be on the bed or blocking the bathroom door. But heck we paid only L33 each per night for the room with private bath (and there was another very nice shared bathroom on the hall which was nice but not really needed except for retrieving more towels or toilet paper in the middle of the night when we were up late talking!) WHAT DO YOU EXPECT IN A PRICEY AREA OF LONDON??? I am no expert on London accommodations but if I had to choose a somewhat nicer b&b farther north or west, say, versus the St. George's which is a tube stop or two from everywhere and which has nice restaurants nearby and which is CHEAP, I would choose the St. George's without question.

Instead we were delightfully surprised - don't be scared off by the low price or bad reviews (there are other St. George's hotels in London -- maybe some of these reviews were linked here by mistake). The hotel, on St. George's drive, is spotlessly clean, in a charming and safe location (Pimlico) with public transport nearby and easy access to passing cabs. We found the staff friendly & helpful. Yes, it would be great if breakfast could be later but the reason they schedule it that way is very obvious - it's clearly a family running the whole operation and they don't have enough staff to extend it later & still get the rooms cleaned up & other tasks done. They probably should switch to a less labor-intensive buffet-style operation. The lack of staff led to some comic situations - at one point I was opening the locked front door for guests because all the staff was so busy serving breakfast. My advice would be, either plan to get to breakfast by 8:00-8:10 or just skip it -- there is a beautiful Italian deli halfway down the block on Lupus St. where you can get a delicious latte & roll very cheap, and it's like stepping into a foreign movie (the owner singing in Italian, his beautiful daughter serving at the counter & being flirted with by customers). There are also great restaurants nearby within walking distance (Goya, Grumbles). Also, remember this is London and most of these family-run B&Bs are converted old houses, with the corresponding old plumbing -- the toilets refill very slowly so you have to plan out your flushes if you have a roomie as I did. At several points we used the extra bathroom on the landing & were grateful to have it. Our bathroom was otherwise updated with tiling & fixtures and looked gorgeous. Oh, except for the built-in hairdryer, from the early 70s, which was hilarious, and worked ok but at a 1970s and not a 2010 standard - no big deal, i found it charming. And, yes, the stairs are very steep & narrow, the rooms are small and there are no elevators (again, both very common with this type of a London B&B), so if this is a deal-breaker for you don't go here or any other B&B. On the plus side, we got exercise without having to schedule it & all lost several pounds on the trip!

I thought that it would be fine, as Eurostar thad it listed as a favorite. I am having a very hard time understanding why anyone would list St. George's as a favorite. And, before I go on, please understand that I am familiar with London, and with the type of hotel this is--I have stayed in many in the same category, in the Victoria and Bloomsbury areas, as well as in other parts of the UK. I did not want, nor did I expect, anything but a clean room, polite innkeepers, and a breakfast if it were promised. I was not expecting the Savoy, in other words. First, I called the hotel the day before our scheduled arrival to make sure all was in order, and to ask if we could keep our bags there until check in time. The woman on the phone was not only rude, but hung up on me. I called back, and she said she did not have a reservation for us (I had a confirmation from Eurostar, and had already paid for the room). I asked her, politely, to please double check, as I was sure there had to be a mistake. She just put the phone down and yelled to someone else. The second person got on the phone, and I started the whole process over. I gave her my surname, the Eurostar reservation confirmation, the works. She said they did not have it. At this point, I asked if they had any family rooms available, even if they could not find the reservation from your company, as reckoned I could straighten it out later. She said \"NO!\" I continued to hold my frustration at bay, and said I would call back. Next, I called Eurostar, and the rep was polite and helpful. She asked me if I minded being put on hold while she investigated, and said she would call the hotel. About 3 minutes later, apologizing for the wait, and said she had called and that we were all set. Just to make sure, I called the hotel again, and the very same woman now told me that they had our reservation. Huh? She did not apologize, nor did she offer an explanation. I have no idea what the problem is with the staff at the St. George's, but there is definitely a problem. My husband asked for the \"free\" internet access code, and was charged 4 pounds. It did not work until the night manager came and reset it. So much for that. The next problem with them came at breakfast. By this time, I had looked for reviews on the web of this hotel, as well as it's own web site (something I wish I had done before booking in they were not good, to say the least) The hotel has two buildings, and one small breakfast room. The tables are so close together, that my daughter (age 10, slim) could not pull her chair far enough away from the guest behind her to fit. We asked if we could move. The very curt, rude woman (who had also been at the front desk) sighed theatrically and then just said \"There\" in a loud voice. We moved, but the next thing we saw was her telling a single woman (of a certain age) that she had to sit somewhere else than where she was sitting. This lady was booked in because her husband was in hospital nearby. The staff did not ask her, they TOLD her to move. She was near tears. I did not hear one \"please\" \"thank you\" or anything of the sort from the entire staff. Of course the guests were the only polite people. The second day, the very rude, curt woman pointed my family and I to a table whose chairs were backed up to a wall with about 3 inches of space between them and the table. I thought \"Well, she may have to move us AGAIN\" and pulled out the chair for my daughter. It was so close to the wall, that it made a small nick. The woman said \"Oh my God, see what you did!\" by this time I had had it with her. So I replied \"Oh my God, maybe you should get tables and chairs in your breakfast room that actually fit\" , She moved us, to another 4 person table. Why she did not seat us there in the first place remains a mystery. AND the breakfast was extremely stingy. My 7 year old son had looked at a photo of an \"English Breakfast\" and was very excited to have one. Well, not only were they not \"full\" but Breakfast was only available between 6:30 and 8:30 am. In fact, we were told to get there by 8, or we would not be served as \"we stop cooking at 8:30.\" In all the B and B hotels in which I have stayed, this has never been the case. Also, there was enough room for all of the guests, and refills of juice, etc. if wanted in all of the similar type hotels I had been in. And they did not require that one is down (in line--we were early, and by the time we left each morning around 7:15 (we wanted to get out as soon as possible) there was a queue up the stairs of guests trying to get their promised (and paid-for) breakfast. There is more, but I have gone on enough already. I write this because I know that many of your customers have never been to London, or have not stayed in this type of hotel. Also, you are a trusted company, and if you list it, it implies that the customer can trust that it will be at least a decent experience. The people who run this hotel are rude, and they don't care at all about their guests. I don't people who run this type of place to be super-nice, they work very, very hard, and they don't really have the time. Also, they are inexpensive. BUT there is no excuse for downright rudeness, lying, and general ill-will toward guests. I am asking you, PLEASE remove St George's Hotel (St. George's Drive, Victoria/Pimlico, London) from your \"favorites\" or preferred list. Or at least that that you don't promote this hotel.

It was about a 15-20 minute walk from Victoria coach station. It cost us \u00c2\u00a375 a night, including breakfast. We stayed in the \"115\" building, which is where the Reception was located. We arrived only to be greeted with: \"Weren't you supposed to be here yesterday?\" I said no, and brought out the email confirmation I had from the hotel confirming that I was arriving on 2nd July for two nights. Even then, they still seemed skeptical. They said they had made a mistake with my booking and already charged me for one night as a \"no show\" penalty fee. I was less than impressed with this. The credit card I had used to guarantee the room had since been reissued, so the payment did not go through as they no longer had up to date details, and the manager got very snooty about this and actually told me off about it! There was no apology for the fact they had made a mistake with my booking. Luckily the room was still available for the two nights. My friend and I were on the very, very top floor in a twin room (room 19). We counted one night...there are 9 sets of stairs to climb. It really put us off nipping to the shops as our legs just couldn't handle so many steep stairs... and we're not exactly unfit! It was during the heatwave and our room was a sauna. We could only open the window a few inches so we were in for a very sweaty visit. The room was okay... definitely a bit \"tired\" looking, and very outdated facilities. We were lucky it was too hot for blankets... the blanket was horribly scratchy. There was a stain on the cover of one of the beds. The room itself was very clean besides this. There was one single bed and one double bed, with a bedside table in between and a desk with two chairs, and a large mirror, and a very old fashioned hairdryer fixed to the wall. The TV was fixed to the wall. It advertises itself as 'satellite TV' but what this actually means is regular channels 1 - 5, BBC News 24 and a couple of foreign language channels. We used the TV once just fine, went out for a few hours, came back and the TV no longer worked. Luckily my friend managed to get it working again (we couldn't face the journey down to Reception again to ask them to fix it!). The alarm radio did not tune into any radio stations clearly. The bathroom was small but adequate. The plumbing was bizarre - if one person used the toilet, the other person could not use it again afterwards for a while or the flush would not work. The toilet never flushed fully. The taps/shower was the same - if it was used once and then turned off, they would not work again next time you turned them on. It took about 5 minutes for them to work again. Very frustrating. There were a few bars of soap on a high shelf in the bathroom, next to a spare toilet roll and two very water-marked glasses. I had to wash them before using them. There was no kettle in the room, and the hot water tap barely got lukewarm. I tried running the tap for a while but the sink filled up - despite the fact the plug was not in!! There was no bin in the bedroom, only in the bathroom. The room was cleaned on the second day of our stay. We came back to find it very neat. However, they had folded our pyjamas and put them under our pillows - a nice sentiment but it took us absolutely ages to find them!! They had also closed our window again, which we had left open due to the unbearable heat. We thought we were coming back to a lovely cool room but unfortunately that was not the case! Breakfast was rather poor. The menu stated: \"Orange juice OR cereal\" - which I realised after the waitress had already come round and offered us juice. She did not mention the fact you had to choose between this or cereal. Tea and coffee was served. I ordered coffee and it came with cream, which I thought was a nice touch. There were a choice of four different types of egg plus \"bacon and sausages\". What this mean was your eggs (I ordered fried and received 2 of them) plus one rasher of bacon and 1 very thin, very small sausage. Breakfast looked a bit lost on the big plate! We also got a tray of toast which was wafer thin and hard as a rock. I was not very impressed at how they skimped on the meal, though the food itself was cooked okay and tasted fine. We also got told where to sit, rather than picking the table ourselves - I noticed that other guests were told where to sit as well. Very strange. The housecleaning staff were friendly and would say hello. What a shame the actual owners of the hotel were not as friendly!!! I have stayed in a total of three different guest houses in Victoria and while this one was by far the cleanest, I have had enough of the sub-standard conditions of guest houses and will be investing in a proper hotel in future!!! I would certainly never stay here again.

This was a pain every time we left or came back. The price paid included a full English breakfast that you had to sign up for beforehand, so we did. We sat waiting at the table for even the woman to come over at all for about 25 minutes (but it's free, I'll wait). Then she did come over and it was the same one who checked us in and who we also saw cleaning rooms later during our stay; I think she's the owner or something. She would just put our food in front of us without saying anything and then when we tried waving her over to get more juice, which took another 10 minutes, she said our glasses HAD to be empty so she refill the ones already used. My friend was looking for an iron and went down to asked the same miserable woman for it. Her response was, \"oh, we have one but it's in another room.\" That was it. We needed an American adapter for the outlets and their only response was, \"we used to have a lot but now we have none,\" so we had to spend another $20 at a store for one. The rooms were TINY! Ours had 3 twin beds in a row and we had to put our luggage in between our beds because there wasn't enough room anywhere else in the room, making it very hard to walk around. The shower door was broken and wouldn't close all the way so it was open a little every time. One day, we had no toilet paper and they didn't even refill it. I went down to the desk and there was an 8-or-so-year old girl there, of whom I asked some toilet paper from. She called someone twice on a phone and it was the SAME woman as all the times before. I just repeated that I needed toilet paper for the room because no one had refilled it. She didn't understand that the T.P. was all I wanted and then made faces at ME because she was interrupted from what she was doing and thought we were checking out (which we did about an hour later). We used a calling card and made a few calls back to the US while at the hotel. When checking out, the same woman handed us a bill for approximately $76 USD for calls made...we actually fought with her and her only response, which she kept repeating was, \"well there's nothing I can do!\" Umm, yes there is!

The owner disagreed and would not accommodate. The owner wouldn't let us stay the night unless we paid the extra \u00c2\u00a375.
