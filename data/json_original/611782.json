There are lots of nearby restaurants and bars, short walk to the tram, and not a bad walk from Central Station. The reception staff spoke good English. WiFi was an effort because you had to sign in with username and password anytime you had been off for 15 minutes. Breakfast was very good. It was served to you at your table (not a buffet) but consisted of the typical Dutch breakfast elements. However, if you were in a hurry, there was no real way to speed up the process. There was no good view from our room, but things were quiet. Our room was much bigger than the standard Amsterdam hotel so it was nice to be able to spread out a bit.

It was one of the nicest all around travel experience I ever had. When we arrived, we were warmly greeted by Pascale and were offered breakfast while our room was being cleaned. We had a complimentary breakfast consisting of of eggs, toast, cold meats, cheeses, juice and all kinds of jams and butters for the toast. Also, Bart (super friendly) makes some dam-good coffee and the cafe was downstairs from the lobby and was very nice. This was the first time I was really able to relax since we arrived. We left our bags and took about an hour walk, came back and was greeted by Mo (forgive me for my incorrect spelling), who was also super friendly and gave us the rundown by map on where to go, what to see, hot to get around and how to access the security door to enter the hotel. We felt very safe and secure. Tram's are everywhere and run constantly, very easy to get around. Our room was ready and we were very pleased. We stayed in room #5, above the lobby, and it had a huge bathroom, great shower, toilet, double sinks, 1 double bed, 1 single bed, 4 chairs a table, coffeemaker, tv, closet with drawers, balcony and was clean. Our linens and towels were all fresh washed and the balcony overlooked the street down to Leidseplein square, which was an awesome location. The room was cleaned regularly and provided fresh towels. We would stay here again for sure. Not only was Amsterdam one of the best places we ever visited but, the Hotel Freeland played a big part of how good our trip was. Friendly, clean and professional is how I would describe Hotel Freeland and when we return, it will be the place we stay. Thanks a lot.

We arrived very late in the evening (after managing to get on the wrong train in the opposite direction from the airport), the guy on reception was a bit frosty at first and told us we should have called as reception was closed but after our rather pathetic excuse he got a bit more cheerful and showed us to our room! The room itself was a decent size, a double and single bed (was room number 5 on first floor), we had explicitly asked for a quieter room as had seen on trip advisor that the front rooms can be noisy as the tram passes outside the front of the hotel and there are a couple of lively bars across the road! The room was indeed quiet, with a large window, large shower room that was fairly powerful and always had hot water! Very comfy beds as well! A huge radiator which we could turn up and down as we wished. Lovely warm room. The only noise we experienced which was a bit frustrating was from the 3 16year old boys who were staying in the room above us who sounded like they were throwing the furniture around at times! But there's not much the staff could have done about that! Breakfast was cheerful and definitely set us up for our days wanderings. Loads of toast, boiled egg, hams and cheeses as well as a range of spreads. The location was fab. Round the corner from the Leidesplein tram stop and walkable distance from everywhere really! It was freezing while we were there yet we still managed the walks in minus temps! We found the staff to be extremely kind, friendly and helpful. They gave us suggestions of where to go, what cafes we should visit and directions! It really helped having free internet on their computer as well to suss things out and pre plan our days.

Man, it was great. Our room was small but had a lovely little sun room - threw all the big bags in there and we were good. If you go to Amsterdam to sit in your room all day then this is not the place for you. If you go to see the sights and something other than lounge, then this is it. It is where you want to be and you WILL NOT find more helpful people. When I thought my husband was MIA Pascale was right there with me ready to wage war in finding him until Manual gently stuck his head around the corner and said, \" I just looked at the ticket...he arrives tomorrow\". Maps, advice, it is all there. A bit noisy at times but if you get in late enough at night, and you will, you will fall back asleep. I can't say enough. It felt like home away from home.

Firstly I arrived very early, took the Connexion bus from Schipol to hotel vicinity [which Manuel was kind enough to advise me:] Obviously I stopped at the depot instead of the bus stop in front of the hotel and had to walk a few minutes and not knowing the direction, I decided to call the hotel to ask for directions...Pascale, answered the call and in a very welcoming voice said she will go out onto the street and wave at my direction and upon arriving, she readily helped my with my heavy suitcase up the stairs. Apologetically she said that my room was not ready, but asked if I want coffee and even guide me to a few places.... overall, I find my stay very comfortable, very welcomed and even though its not a 5-star hotel, the service and the friendliness of the staff Pascale, Manuel and others were very helpful. I was lucky to have the single room on the ground floor at the back and it was quiet and slept well. I would admit that its not glamourous or anything but basic and clean and that is good enough for me and for that price [as hotel rooms in Amsterdam is expensive] and the location so close to Leidsplein is really a bonus ....with so many places to eat and shopping....so I highly recommend Freeland Hotel - however, if anyone who expects to have a 5-star hotel environment, go stay at Marriot...I would say that this is like a 'Marriot' amongst the 3-stars [better than some other 3-star hotels nearby].... so you pay what you get and remember if you are not going to stay at the hotel the whole day and dont want to spend too much $$ - then Freeland is just the place for you....and last but not least, its really like a home away from home.

I was lucky to have room 7 coz it was the 1st room on the 1st floor. I was even luckier as the receptionist has helped me to take my 24kg-suitcase up to the scarily steep staircase. The second day of my trip I felt tired at the morning and I hanged the little \"do not disturb\" sign at the door. Then they didn't clean my room. At the evening I found that I was running out of toilet paper and towel, I ran to the reception to get some, the receptionist immediately gave me new towel and toilet paper and said sorry about that, while actually it's ME hanging that sign on the door. The location is superb. A few step next to Leisplein. You can take bus no. 197 to Leisplein and then walk to the hotel in 2 minutes. It's much easier and cheaper than taking the train to Amsterdam Central Station then tram no. 1/2/5. There are shops and fast food restaurants opened til midnight. The only thing that can be improved is that, the heat doesn't work quite well. The hot water was dripping inside the heater for the whole night, and it's not very warm.

Although the hotel is round the corner from all the action the street it's on is relatively quiet. Perhaps the front of the hotel gets some street noise but I had a room at the rear and I heard nothing. The reception area has a couple of tables with chairs (like a little caf\u00c3\u00a9, perhaps) and free tea and coffee are on tap all day. There's also a selection of books, magazines and DVDs to borrow. In the hallway there's a drinks vending machine (beer, coke, etc.) and a computer with free internet access. Wi-fi codes are also available free from reception. The hotel is decorated around various flower themes and may not appeal to everyone. But clearly a lot of work and though has gone in to the d\u00c3\u00a9cor and everything matches and co-ordinates. I had a single room on the second floor (Room 11) and it was a 'rose' room. I've uploaded a couple of photos. Although not particularly large, the room felt spacious enough. There was a single bed, bedside table, a little chair and matching stool, one of those folding things you can put your case on and a wall cabinet with a hanging rail below. There was a TV/DVD combo, bedside light and fan. The en suite bathroom had a toilet, sink and shower. Although not particularly big, it didn't feel claustrophobic, either. Everything was very clean and the room was serviced daily. Breakfast was typically Dutch - bread and cake with jams, hams, cheeses, hard-boiled egg, orange juice and tea or coffee. All very tasty and nicely served. The staff were friendly and helpful but not over-friendly; they happily answer questions and offer advice but don't tend to ingratiate themselves - if you like your hosts to interrogate you on your previous day's adventures and your current day's plans this isn't the place for you. Like I said, they're friendly but not \"in your face\". Minor issues are dealt with promptly - a blown light bulb was replaced immediately and a jammed DVD player, when reported as I was leaving for the day, was repaired by the time I returned late afternoon.

This is a good choice if you are looking for a reasonably priced option and are not expecting the ritz.", "Date": "August 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Sussex, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, pity about the stairs.\u201d", "Author": "Roger-in-Peacehaven", "ReviewID": "UR7974313", "Content": "I had a week or so's holiday due to me from the part time job which I do in our local supermarket in June 2007(my Easyjet money as I call it!), and as I had never been to Amsterdam before, I considered that the city would be a interesting place to visit for a short break. Upon researching the internet beforehand, I was disappointed to find that Amsterdam is quite an expensive city in which to stay, and being a budget traveller, I had to spend much time trying to find accommodation at a price which I could afford, but which on the other hand was not too grotty. At this point in time I must make it clear that without being a prude I was not interested in 'Red Light' districts, weed or space cakes because at the age of 64 I am really past all this old nonsense!! - in fact in my time no doubt I've tried it all anyway! My only requirement regarding my hotel was that it needed to be cheap,clean and safe,offering a good breakfast, and easily accessible to the city centre too. Getting to and from Amsterdam from where I live in Peacehaven in East Sussex was no problem, and I managed to do this cheaply by booking seperate return coach tickets over the internet on the National Express(Brighton-London, Funfare \u00c2\u00a34 return) and Eurolines coaches(London-Amsterdam; Netherlands special \u00c2\u00a337 return fare)which as you can see only cost me \u00c2\u00a341 in total from Brighton to Amsterdam and back. At these prices I just had to go! - even the cheapest return Easyjet flight from Gatwick to Amsterdam at the time of booking would had cost me \u00c2\u00a355, and I would had to additionally buy a return coach ticket from my home to Gatwick Airport to get to and from the airport. and I must say that I do consider that the extra airport taxes imposed by our wonderful(?) british government in February 2007 are absolute greed to say the least,(whatever blurb they may give you about global warming to try to justify this extra taxation !) and I do feel extremely sorry for the budget airlines such as Easyjet who do such an excellent job, and with whom I've have previously had many satisfactory flights, but who potentially stand to lose many passengers as a result of these extra taxes, as people such as myself on limited incomes have no option other than to seek out the cheapest fares, which in this particular instance turned out to be by coach. In any event part of the fun of going away is finding yourself a 'cheapo' fare! I would add also that upon arrival in Amsterdam the coach terminates at Amstel Station, which is very conveniently placed about a couple of miles or so away from the city centre, and from which point it is cheaper to gain access to the city than from Schiphol Airport ever would had been - in fact I walked it! The only downside to the coach trip was that it was an eleven hour through journey each way between London and Amsterdam,and as a point of interest my outward journey was made via the Dover-Calais channel crossing, and the return trip was through the Channel Tunnel, and I must add that the 'Eurolines' direct coach service between London and Amsterdam whilst hardly of five star quality was in fact quite an acceptable and convenient service. My chosen hotel was the Hotel Freeland, 386 Marnixstraat, Amsterdam which in the event turned out to be very conveniently situated for the Leidseplein which was around five hundred yards away at the most, and this is a popular tourist area with many restaurants, bars and shops and it is located fairly near to the city centre which is within walking distance if you so wish, and there are excellent tram links to the city taking around ten minutes or so. I booked the Hotel Freeland directly over the internet beforehand,([--]) and my single room cost me \u00e2\u201a\u00ac65 per night which I considered to be expensive compared to hotels in other european cities in which I had stayed previously, but in fairness to the Hotel Freeland this price seemed consistant with the current Amsterdam prices allowing for the fact that this hotel was so centrally situated, and I noted that many other Amsterdam hotels seemed to be charging up to double this amount, and according to internet reviews which I had perused beforehand I had noticed that whilst there were cheaper hotels available, none of them had particularily brilliant reviews from their guests and it seemed to be that they were either infested with mice or fleas, which prompted my decision to stay at the Hotel Freeland where previous guests' reviews were quite favourable. Upon my arrival at the Hotel Friendland I was immediately made welcome by an extremely pleasant lady called Barbara who seemed to do everything from man the reception desk to serve the breakfasts each morning. However, the hotel presented me with a problem straightaway insomuch that my room(a single room,No.12)was located on the third floor of the building, and as I've already mentioned I am in my sixties (I also have a back problem which cost me a year off work just over two years ago) and I did find it extremely difficult to take my suitcase up to the third floor of the building as the staircase was extremely steep, certainly nothing like any staircase that I had ever seen before in England before. However I am told that this is quite normal for dutch buildings, and whilst I do not wish to appear negative, I must mention that it was still very difficult for me to negotiate the stairs even without any luggage during the course of my stay, and so I would suggest that if you do consider staying at this hotel I would recommend that you agree beforehand when making your booking that you ensure that your reservation is for a room located on the ground or on one of the lower floors should you have difficulties climbing steep staircases - otherwise you may well live to regret it! I do feel that in view of all the foreign visitors who visit Amsterdam and probably this hotel, that perhaps the management could well use this situation to its' advantage and point out to potential guests that this is an authentic and beautiful dutch building in which they wish to stay, but through necessity it does however retain many of its' original features including the steep staircases, and guests who for any reason feel uncomfortable about climbing steep staircases are recommended to reserve rooms on the lower floors - This would be a good public relations exercise for the hotel I feel, and it would not draw unneeded attention to a negative aspect of the building by potential guests.. I was a little disappointed with my room(bearing in mind that it had cost me \u00c2\u00a345 per night) - it was very small - and the private loo/shower smelt, and it seemed to me that the extractor fan located above the shower head was not functioning. However on a more positive note, the bed was comfortable, a couple of cushions, an extra blanket and spare loo roll were provided also, and there was constant hot water too, and I found that the whole hotel including my room was kept clean and tidy - so it wasn't all bad news I am pleased to say. A bedside lamp and a fan were provided in the room, and there was also a television set with nine channels in the room seated on top of a fitted cupboard, but this was so high up due to the lack of room space that watching television was uncomfortable and neck ache was envitable should you had wished to watch television for any length of time. My room had a pleasant view overlooking the road and a canal, and there were two bars on the opposite side of the road to the hotel which didn't close until 3am, but luckily they were not too noisy; however, you could be woken in the middle of the night when they closed at 3am, but the efficient double glazing in my bedroom did eliminate the street noise when the bedroom window was closed - but then in June I did need to open the window a little otherwise my room would had become too stuffy! Should you be a young person and want a night life finishing at 3am - I think that you would be very well suited here - and my comments really do prove that we are all individuals who have differing needs and priorities when booking hotel rooms - but for me, no thanks! ... ... ... ... whilst I enjoy a drink, I still need my beauty sleep!! Breakfast was served from 8am to 10.30am, and comprised of three varied slices of bread served with cheese and sliced meats. A toaster was provided for guests to toast their bread slices, and butter, jam and peanut butter was provided also. Tea and coffee was supplied, although the tea cups provided were very small - next time I'll bring my mug from home! A boiled egg in an eggcup also was provided - but every morning the egg was hard boiled, which rather spoilt the otherwise reasonable breakfast provided by the hotel - perhaps egg timers haven't been invented yet in Amsterdam! I stayed for four nights at the Hotel Freeland, and everybody with whom I came into contact with was courteous, polite and helpful....especially Barbara the member of staff who really couldn't do enough for you. A public telephone, a Coca-Cola vending machine(\u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 for a can of coke)which was handy, and most usefully free internet access was provided in the hotel lobby so that one could keep up with their e/mails. Basically I came away fairly satisfied - the hotel is extremely conveniently situated and it is clean and warm. However as I departed I took one last look back at the Hotel Freeland, and I said to myself, \"thank goodness I won't ever have to climb those stairs again!\" Summing up I feel that the Hotel Freeland is reasonable value for money at today's Amsterdam prices, but I do consider that it is really a hotel better suited for younger people - not for old codgers in their sixties like myself suffering with bad backs and the like, although had I known about the steep staircases and requested a ground floor room when I booked my room it may well had been a different story - but then its' so easy to be wise after the event!", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Islington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery good value\u201d", "Author": "FatChris", "ReviewID": "UR7711017", "Content": "Booked this hotel for a friend and myself, when we turned up we had been allocated a double bed rather than a twin bed.

This is typical dutch building, tall and narrow, and because of this has plenty of stairs!!! If you have problems walking I would suggest contacting the hotel to request a ground floor, the breakfast is served in the basement so there would still be the stairs to go down there but at least you would not have to climb to go to your room. Rooms are clean and tidy and ours both had en-suites which were basic shower rooms, again these were clean and tidy, clean towels are provided and any dirty ones you leave on the floor will be replaced daily as the rooms are cleaned and beds made. The staff are very friendly and are on hand to provide help with anything you need to know about Amsterdam.
