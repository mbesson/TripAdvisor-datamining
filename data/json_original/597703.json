It is beautiful, but at the same time comfortable and \"homey\". And has a wonderful garden for chilling out. The service is correct, friendly, and attentive without being cloying. I was on an unusual trip, which I had originally booked for four days. The Villa was so great that i extended for three more and hired a car (thru them) to take me to my out of town meetings rather than change hotel. I have stayed in most of the top hotels in London, Beijing, New York, Tokyo, and Bangkok over the years. I would not rate ANY of them higher than my stay here.

The wonderful things included the courteous and attentive staff, the morning breakfast in the dining room, the beautiful public spaces (as a converted mansion, it's as if you are staying in the home of a Rich, VERY RICH, Italian friend--there is a richness and authenticity to the spaces which is remarkable), the very, very secure neighborhood, blissfully powerfully air conditioning and the walking distance to Trevi, Parthenon, etc...(remember, you walk a lot more Europe and it's good for you!). The apartment is not in the main building; it's in a building about 100 feet away, which contains business offices and whatnot (must have also been owned by the same rich family)--and on a high floor. It has a full kitchen, a living room and two bedrooms and two baths. The one bedroom has two twin beds and the other a king. The mattresses are firm and the housekeeping immaculate (no room service in the Apartment, however; and the WiFi never worked correctly while we there). One cautionary note to ANY visitor to Rome who plans on sleeping at night at any point before 2-3 AM---It's a loud City (you knew that) and the primary offender is the sputtering cavalcade of scooters that carry young and old alike to and fro through the City. This means that even in the private rented apartments of apparently wealthy Romans---there's noise at night from the street. Earplugs are your friend. Nanny reported that the main hotel's bedrooms had the same issue. Of course, if we had been going out until 3:00 am ourselves (with the 4 and 7 year old, hmmm, is this a bad idea?), we would have never noticed.... Also, although I would stay in the Apartment again with children, I am not sure that the main hotel building would be a good fit---far, far too many antiques of ancient (and expensive) provenance left casually on the walls and whatnot that could be nerve-wracking.

The room rate includes a bar fridge filled with beer, water, soft drink and spirits; all you can drink. The breakfast room is divine with lovely china and table wear. You can choose from the Continental breakfast which is laid out from 7 am to 11 am (very generous), or you can ring a bell and have something cooked fresh. (This is much better than the standard hot buffets, where everything ends up cold and chewy.) The hedged garden is very nice, especially in the early evening when complimentary bar service runs for a number of hours and it\u2019s very pleasant to sit and relax after a hard days touring on comfy lounges and just enjoy the fresh air. There\u2019s also a roof top area with lovely views, more lounges and water on ice for guests\u2019 use. The downstairs area is decorated beautifully and has lots of quiet reading areas, or just places to relax and chat. It\u2019s very centrally situated; walking distance to many of the sights and the staff are very friendly and happy to help with taxi\u2019s, tour bookings and restaurant recommendations. While not exactly cheap, the website is a true depiction of what your money buys (unlike some sites where they make the rooms look huge and they\u2019re the size of a closet). It's quite luxurious actually and I cannot recommend this boutique hotel enough.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201c***THE Place to Stay in Rome***\u201d", "Author": "vancouverfamily6", "ReviewID": "UR118709966", "Content": "We stayed at the Villa in mid July for 5 nights.

I also called the reservations agent in Rome to let them know, more than three days before we were to arrive. Our flights were cancelled multiple times because of the hurricane, causing us to lose several days of our honeymoon. :-( I was informed that Villa Spalletti management would need to subsequently rule on our case as to the deposit. After an extended delay, I was informed that our deposit would be non-refundable, despite the clearly beyond-our-control circumstances of our inability to begin our honeymoon as planned, and the substantial efforts we had made to show good faith and communicate the circumstances to them in as timely a manner as possible. I had very much looked forward to our stay, and am surprised that such a fine hotel would treat us in this fashion, when the cause of our change of plans was very clearly and publicly out of our control, and we gave them ample opportunity as soon as we could to put the room back up for reservations.

This was unlike anywhere I have stayed for several reasons: The refrigerator in the room is stocked with miniature bottles of liquor, all of which are free. In the evening a sideboard in one of the drawing rooms is set with Prosecco, ice and every other liquor you could want.

The only concern we had was trying to communicate with the hotel before going. For some reason, they couldn't email us and we had to call to confirm everything. That made me worried about their internet and I almost cancelled. I am so happy I didn't. We traveled all through Italy and this was our favorite hotel.

It looked like we were at the door to someone's house, which Villa Spalletti was before being transformed into a boutique hotel. When you ring the bell, which you will do each time you return to the hotel, someone answers immediately. The interior of the Villa Spalletti is beautiful. It was obviously remodeled, but it has kept its old world charm. Our \"family apartment\" was two adjoining rooms sharing a single main entrance. Each room was surprisingly spacious for Rome, with king beds in each. Each room also had a full size bath with double sink vanities, seamless glass showers, and every modern amenity you could possibly want. The well-stocked minibars were complimentary, and a nice way to end a day of sightseeing in the hot August sun. The staff was great. Most of the people working the desk were young (under 30) and very fluent in English. It's a very small hotel, so the staff is readily available. There is no concierge as such, but whoever is at the desk is happy to help with directions, reservations, taxis, etc. You can't beat the location.

It was the most amazing and enchanting place to stay at - on Quirinal Hill. Check out the hotels website for particulars. It is situated on Via Piacenza across from Piazza del Quirinale, a quaint one block sized city park. The hotel is just 1 block away from Quirinal Palace, Italy's White House. The neighborhood is extremely quiet due to the many government offices and lack of tourists, rarely would a car or scooter pass by. We slept with the windows open during our stay on the second floor (American 3rd floor). Since it was winter, we didn't bother turning on the AC and never used the heat due to the room being warm enough already. The hotel did stay warm in all common areas and would also fire up a fireplace nightly. The fireplace would give the hotel a warm woodsy smell. Seldomly, you could hear a small dog barking during its evening walk. Once outside the hotel, whether you made a right turn down Via Parma or a left turn down Via Della Consulta you would arrive at Via Nazionale, where you would find some action. The hotel is 10 minutes away from the Trevi Fountain. The Colloseum is a very long walk down Via dei Serpenti. The front door of the hotel is rather unassuming, until you enter the foyer with it's dual spiral staircase. The foyer is very impressive. The front desk area is small but adequate. We were asked if we wanted anything to drink. \"Of course\" we said and we were presented with the most fabulous cappuccinos with fancy cookies. We were handed one key with a leather key tag, very impressive. After passing through the double wooden doors, the room awakens once the key is inserted into the light switch. The fully stocked minibar is complimentary and has an awesome assortment of spirits, liquors, beers, sodas, juices, mineral water and spring water. The bathroom is extremely luxurious with a large glass enclosed shower with a detachable shower head, a marble double sink vanity, a heated towel rack, a vanity mirror, a bidet, a toilet, a tub and REN toiletries. The towels were soft and thick. The safe was located in the left closet. There were two roomy closets and a chest of four drawers. The room had a very tall window surrounded by two comfortable arm chairs with a small table with a basket of Unico chocolates and interesting reading materials. The large LCD screen, maybe a 42\" screen, had several hundred channels of Sky Tv. Also in the room were a desk & chair, a superbly plush kingsize bed with two nightstands. All the lights were controlled via a box on each nightstand with six buttons. Our room had the green color scheme with a soft fabric wall paper and an immense antique map on the opposite wall. The only drawback is that there was no internet access in the rooms but complimentary wifi downstairs in the lounges. Awesome room overall. Breakfast was very complete with specialty yogurts in glass jars, fresh fruit juices, numerous cheeses, two different prosciuttos, several breads and whatever hot beverage you desired.

Well, for starters we booked theleast expensive room in the hotel, myself and my husband. The room was excellent, linens high quality, bed of good quality (and I am picky) ac great, bath with shower sep tub, bidet and 2 sinks. Heated towel rack a great plus. Lots of fluffy towels, robes, good bath ameneties, and yes, washcloths -a rarity in Italy. The complimentary mini bar was a nice touch, although we were only interested in the mineral water there was beer, pop, alcohol. Hi gh speed internet worked well. Great lighting. Decor made a bright, cherry room. We heard absolutely no noise at night, windows had thick wooden shutters to block out light and sound. Is there anything I can criticize?.........I need to find something, or I will have found the perfect hotel (which I am sure cannot exist) The only clock was small and on the TV, couldn't see it well from bed and I could not find an alarm on it. I carry my cell phone ( clock and alarm) so it was no bother. You can get a wake up call from front desk. I think none of the Italian hotels I stayed in had an alarm clock. That was the room. Now, the other ameneties. Breakfast was top notch. Its worth explaining since I read a previous review that felt the breakfast was less than perfect. What a spread. Cappucino, latte etc made to order, just press the bell by the door and an attendant will come to take your order ( if she is not already there greeting you !) Choice of breads and rolls, jams honey. Pasteries and cakes. Incredible yougurt. Cereal and granola. My personal favorites, cheeses and sliced ham and salami. Of course, fresh fruit and juices. There was probably more, too. All served on fine china with real silver. Somehow that makes it taste even better. Oh, did I forget the beatiful sunshine coming through the windows which overlooked the beautiful gardens? Breakfast was served late as well, until 11. That came in really handy when we overslept on our fist (and very jet lagged) morning. Well, what else can I say....location is in a quiet part of Rome, a real plus as Rome is busy with cars and noisy on the main streets. There are still plenty of places to eat and bank machines etc nearby. The location is indeed central to most Roman sights....which brings me to some advice for getting around. Rome is spread out, it is big and hilly. If you want to walk, get in shape before your trip. The metro stop is still a bit of a walk (10min-maybe more, we walk fast) from hotel, but the metro stops in general are very spread out. I actually used a cab to hotel upon arrival from airport (good service, Roman cabs get my stamp of approval) and upon departure to train station. I feel that one of the best ways to experience a city is on its public transport and by walking, but with limited time I would indeed recommend a cab in Rome for certain trips, to save time and your feet! We had done our homework so didn't need much help with planning, but any questions we had were expertly answered by the hotel staff, they recommended excellent restaurants for us. In Italy, supper is not before 8pm. Its quite nice, really once you get used to it. You leave our key at the desk when you leave ( a custom we lack here, in North America) Its a nice personal touch. The staff know when you are gone, and housekeeping goes in and cleans your room, like magic its done when you get back. No \"do not disturb\" sign needed, although there was one available. I really liked the fact that you rang a bell to enter the hotel, I felt very secure because of this feature. We did not have time to use the spa/exercise facility, as we were busy sight seeing all day, but I am sure it would have been excellent judging from the rest of the hotel. There were complimentary drinks and snacks before supper hour in the lounge area, alcohol, mix, pop, prosecco........very nice touch. We had a drink and read a bit before going out one evening, very relaxing. Another helpful tip or 2...there is a travel agency just around the corner. Buy your train ticket there in advance to avoid line ups or impersonal machines at staion. The hotel has only a small sign out front and is on a side street. I gave the cab driver a map I had printed out from the hotel's website and he had a GPS (which yes he was typing into while driving us... I give Roman drivers much credit, I could not drive in Rome) but when he dropped us at the far edge of the hotel, I still think that neither I nor the driver knew exactly where the hotel was. I had remembered a photo onTA with the white steps going up to the park across the street, so when I saw the steps I knew we were at the right spot. Thanks to the TA member for that photo! Overall, the best there is in Rome, don't stay anywhere else. Downside, the Villa Spalletti Trivelli spoiled me for the rest of my Italy trip, it made my relatively adequate Venice hotel ( where I stayed next) feel like a hand me down....", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Perfect\u201d", "Author": "dms422", "ReviewID": "UR69224602", "Content": "We could not have found a more perfect place to stay in Rome!

With respect to all the superb Tripadvisor reviews we reserved our stay for a couple of days in the Villa. We booked in advance directly with the Villa Spalletti over their Homepage and later by E-Mail. Everything worked well in advance, we paid a non refundable deposit and got our booking confirmation by the same day. Fine! Currently we're back from our several days trip from the capital of Italy. Thankfully we had amazing days in Rome, but unexpectedly we were nearly but not 100% satisfied in the Villa Spalletti. If you like, please find our pros and cons below; it's our personal impression after 4 days in Rome: Pros from our point of view: ------------------------------------- - the geographic location is amazing; you can reach all major sightseeing places and local hot spots of Rome by foot (if you like) ... or taxi - the whole Villa is in an excellent condition, well refurbished and like \"a home of a wealthy knight / nobleman in the mediaeval times\" - need to say in other words again: the guest rooms, the living rooms, the corridor: everything is very noble and build with high premium quality - the hamman is very generous and authentic designed. Nearby (in the Villa) is a well invested fitness room. - all materials in our room were selected with high value as well: the king size bed, the bed-linen, Flat- TV, the nice wooden floor, the exclusive bath-room with a shower, bath tub, 2 washbowls, a bidet, the exclusive free cosmetics... - the complimentary minibar service was highly appreciated as well: we had a daily refill, the choice of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks were broad. Only wine and champagne is not inclusive. - in the afternoons and evenings we had very tastefully and complimentary tea- times in the living room. Very nice atmosphere near to the fireplace. Gorgeous! - if the weather is nice you shouldn't miss the well-kept garden from the Villa Spalletti ... what a nice place for a short break - regarding the fact that the Villa only offer 12 rooms everything is in a very convenient and private atmosphere Cons from our point of view: -------------------------------------- - with respect to the 5 star quality standard of the Villa we experienced a staff with appreciable english language problems - we're not english native speakers as well but we had multiple \"language challenges\" with different people of the Hotel regarding their lack of normal english skills. Beginning with conversations problems with the front desk during the check in at our first day, continued twice in the morning when we order \"an omelette with vegetables and mushrooms\" e.g. - due to the information on the Homepage of the Villa Spalletti the Fitness room and Hamman has been closed: \"We inform you that our Wellness Center and Gym won't be available for the time being. Normal routine will be restaured shortly\". This was the reason for us, that we left our sportswear at home. Locally I learned that both rooms are already opened for weeks... the staff member informed us \"that we've forgotten to update our homepage\"... yes, what a pity! - our room had only one window - this is owing to the fact that it is an old building of course, but we like bright rooms at day time - the room had no isolated window. Of course, the Villa is located in a more quite side street, but we heard many sounds in the night, inclusive a loud and long conversation on the street at our first night. Calm is something different. - the room had no modern heating system, we discovered a bad moulding in colder nights with the thin blanket. Because of the fact that you need to use a fan, it wasn't silent in the room during the use. - we are frequent travellers, but when we compare the breakfast to our other 5 star Hotel experiences in this price range... the breakfast in the Villa was a disappointment. They only offer white bread, at one weekend day the bread was dry as well, and a very small range of alternatives. The rest of the daily breakfast offer was not impressive too. Overall, this was not worth the place, additionally the service has forgotten the ordered cappuccino on two different days as well... - in the room you will find a modern TV- System. Very modern; I hope and think that I have good technical skills, but for the beginning a remote control with empty batteries, a never seen before SKY televison modem and all information in italian language only were really challenging... additionally we found no information in the room how to call the reception from the room (\"9\")... later we learned that we can find it in the map with the room information - unfortunately (at least for me) only in the foreign language I cannot speak... - our experience with the front desk was not impressive too: during the check out process the staff member answered a call and didn't ask something like \"Did you enjoy you stay?\"... Our summary: -------------------- We had good and nice days and nights in the Villa Spalletti Trivelli. But as you can see above we experienced some things we didn't like as well.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWhat aWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jen2606", "ReviewID": "UR58643372", "Content": "There is nothing that could be said to change my mind from stating that this is an outstanding hotel.

We arrived early morning our first day and they immediately made us feel comfortable, giving us breakfast (fantastic espresso, much needed after the overnight flight) and even access to our room to rejuvinate and freshen up. Of course, this may not always be possible depending on time of year and guest load but you have to love a place that makes it happen when it can.

Situated two blocks from the Presidential Palace, security and peaceful evenings are guaranteed, plus a wonderful selection of pathways to virtually all of Rome's wonderful destinations. I don't know the ratio of staff to guests, but it has to be among the highest among 5-star properties, and the attitude and treatment are royal and genuine; no obsequiousness here, no snotty waiters, no condescension. Truly lovely people who love their work--making you totally happy. We were so delighted with our stay, that I am now sending my sister and her son on a first trip to Rome so they, too, can experience this Villa.

Other reviewers are telling the truth regarding the richly furnished guestrooms, large marble bathrooms, complimentary minibar and cocktail hour, excellent breakfast buffet, and the attentive, professional but not-at-all snooty service. Our cab driver did not know how to get there, but I loved the location, on a fairly quiet street across from the Quirinale palace but only a five or ten minute walk from the Fontana Trevi or Piazza Venezia. We usually would not spend precious time in Rome on spa treatments, but our package included two excellent massages in the villa's basement spa. One mild disappointment was the dinner included in our package: while professionally presented and served, the food was more like \"banquet food,\" and not quite up to the high standards of everything else at the villa. (Of course, Rome is a city of excellent food , so it's tough competition.) This hotel is expensive, but worth it if you can afford it.
