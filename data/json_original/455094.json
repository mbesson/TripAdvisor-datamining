There are many problems due to change of management of this hotel. As I have been told, personnels are not paid so most of them are not helpful. Breakfast and lunch are tasetless with limited choices. Most of the restaurant mentioned in their website are closed. There is a night club which plays music loud. At the chekout they wanted to charge us 92 Dhr for mini bar while we never used it. We talked to another person and he didn't ask anybody to check our minibar and we checked out. I think there is no clear rule in this hotel and staff request charges as they want. The only positive point about this hotel is that it is clean. The location is far from deira and you have long distance to restaurant or shopping centers in deira.

We were staying with Xclusive apartments in Dubai and had plans to go to Abu Dhabi after that. However, we changed our plans and stayed in Dubai. As Xclusive did not have the room available so we had to make a last minute booking in Ramada. And this was our worst decision. Rude and arrogant staff, did not bother to keep us waiting for this long at the reception although we were a family of 4. We had taken 2 rooms for 4 adults ( 2 couples) but they gave us rooms with 2 single beds each !!! We requested them to change but nobody helped. We called for Kettle so that we can heat some water as had sore throat and did not want to drink cold water. Reception said we do not have kettle, if you want hot water we can give for 10 dirhams. That was crazy money for a 3 glasses of hot water ! We called for room service. Most of the items listed on menu card were not available in the kitchen. I requested them to cook it as I can wait. But they refused to cook. We finally ordered Indian curry, got the food which tasted good. I called room service to send some mint sauce or pickle (a usual thing given with all Indian dishes), but they said they have it but would charge 10 dirhams for it. That was the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I said no to it. When we checked in the hotel they kept our passport saying they will return them after scanning them, But when we called next day they said they will return only when we check out. I said I want it, but they denied, saying that it is our policy and cannot return it before checkout. WORST THING - on the second day morning when we reached the restaurant for buffet breakfast they stopped us from eating saying, sorry it is not included in your package. But we said that we had it yesterday, on which they said it was by mistake. And now we need to pay. By that time we were so disappointed with them, that did not even bother to check out booking details to see if breakfast was included or not in the room rent. When we were leaving, we wanted to give them feedback and mentioned that we had stayed with Ramada earlier, in other countries, and it has always been good, unlike this one, so why the difference in service. On that, reception simply replied with a smile, sorry we are not the same.

Not all TV channels were shown despite having them on channel list of hotel.

The first thing you need to know is that there are massage services on the top floor and if that makes you suspicious, it should. There are also many Russian women in the bars and they're not there to promote Russian business interests. Of course, that may be what you want and if it is then look no further -- you've found it. I know no other Dubai hotel that tries to hold on to your passport until you check out, but this one does. If they try to keep yours, do what I did and demand it back. The law in the UAE requires them to take a copy of the page in your passport that has your entry stamp on it but it does not require that they keep it and there may be times on your trip when you need it. The food is not good at any time but breakfast is awful. The hotel has an unpleasant smell about it and it's the smell of dirt. The towels in your bathroom will be old and grey, the bed will be hard and the pillow will not help you to sleep. On the plus side, it's close to the airport; on the minus side it's a long way from main shopping and business areas. On the other hand, there's a Metro station right outside. It's cheap, but it isn't THAT cheap -- if you haggle before you arrive you don't have to pay much more to be in the Five Star Murooj Rotana and, if you want to be close to the airport, the Al Bustan Rotana is almost the same price (Yes, I'm a Rotana fan and I have a Rotana Rewards card but I'm not a Rotana employee or stooge).

Upon arrival, realized I'd stayed here the last time with tumultuous results. 1st Trip: My colleague and I arrived in Dubai after 14+ hours in Economy, from NYC. Had a few beverages at Blues and Cues (Sports Bar) on the Mezzanine Floor. Which, unfortunatley I happened to be staying directly above the bar. Loud, base felt in the bed, while sleeping. Ugh, breakfast included, but not until 6am, left at 5am. Horrble experience 1 Star. 2nd Trip - Inadvertant Reservation Booked 'em the 2nd time, because I didn't think, and didn't reckon it was the same place. They offer a shuttle service from the airport, which I highly recommend, saves you the 40+ DHM from the airport taxi, and they meet you right after customs in the arrivals hall. Check in was a pain, I'd reserved on Ramada.com, and got the $132 inclusive rate for Internet, Airport Transfer, and Breakfast, unfortunately most hotels charge you 100 - 125 dirhams for the Internet access, poor wireless at that. Argued that it was inclusive with my reservation, which I had to prove, rather than included in their reservation system. Watch out, they charge you for everything. After sorting out the Internet Challenge, and assuring a \"quiet room\" everything was smooth. No airport transfers before 6am, but a taxi at that time of the mornng is inexpensive comparatively. All in all, I'd rate the Ramada a 2.5 out of 5, C rating. Give you the basics, rooms are old, but clean, and the staff is nice.
