The deck clerk was rude when we checked in - I stood beside the only person checking in and the clerk snapped at me to \"get in line\" like there were dozens of people waiting. I would strongly suggest that you spend a few dollars more and go somewhere that was more welcoming.

The rooms were clean, had great comfortable beds, and the usual refrigerator and microwave. We also had small outdoor balconies. You can see from the photo that it is an older property, but it has been nicely renovated. We checked across the hall and saw that some king size rooms had a nice view of the marina that was across from us. Other reviews have commented on the elevator, and I agree it is small, but we managed just fine and often used the stairs. I noticed that there were accessible rooms handily located on the ground floor. The breakfast was cereal, make-you-own waffles, pastries, yogurt, toast, that sort of thing. Denny's is a short walk away if you want bacon and eggs. The breakfast room was well maintained. Here I saw families, older couples, and a few businesspeople. There was an outdoor pool area with lounge chairs but it was a little bit too cool outside to try, but it looked appealing and would be popular in warmer weather, I imagine. The neighborhood, which I think is called Point Loma, has small restaurants, stores, and the marina all just outside. There is a huge shopping complex a short cab ride away. I thought we might be isolated from all the sights, but since we've been to San Diego before it didn't bother us.

Other than that, the room was very large we thought. There were 2 double beds, the view wasn't the best but who cares really. We were next to an exterior door that stated it would be locked overnight but it wasn't at all. Room had a very nice size fridge and microwave.

Coupled with an off-airport car rental at Enterprise (R), you won't find a better alternative in SD at the price. I was able to secure a very competitive rate for the stay directly through Ramada site (although sourced initially through Priceline.com). Staff (especially co-manager, Juyita) was courteous, helpful and accommodating. Rooms are large enough, but oversized furniture and interior design don't maximize spatial quality. Room 202 had nice alcove adjacent bathroom, but not much of a view. Wet area (including dressing alcove) nicely outfitted (granite flat surfaces, including vanity). Fridge and microwave in room with adequate access to restaurants and grocery. The hallways are the most notable detraction - need updating, and hall lights at night shine through under door. Neither of these should otherwise deter guests. Rooms are clean and housekeeping staff is attentive to cleanliness. Breakfast is adequate - nothing spectacular - and self-serve hot waffles available. I did take the opportunity to pass on (via private forum) a few business \"tweaks\" to management, primarily guest room space utilisation and healthy menu offerings for breakfast.

What we liked: you could open the windows, there is a microwave and fridge in each room, the bed and pillows were awesome, really comfy, high speed internet, free parking, great housekeeping, and greatest asset of this hotel: location! What we didn't like: smell, small details such as scratches or stains on the wall and on the door, the bathroom vanity (I can't even describe it, but it was weird - see the photo), rusty hinges, small holes in the bathroom wall, show lack of maintenance. The bathroom is in great need of an upgrade, the towels were clean but old and worn - they need to be replaced. The continental breakfast was good, there were several choices: cereal, pastries, fruit, yogurt even waffles on Saturday and Sunday. The breakfast room, though, is quite small, only 4 tables and it gets hard to find an empty table after 9. While it was not perfect, it was ok, we didn't spend too much time in the room anyway during the day. And we booked it through Expedia, so we paid a reasonable price (even though a month ago, for the same money we stayed at Hampton Inn and there is no comparison!). Would I stay there again? Probably not! There are so many choices for the same money.", "Date": "August 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cgreat location but room had thin walls and needs some work!\u201d", "Author": "Nichobemo", "ReviewID": "UR30130284", "Content": "The people were very friendly and the breakfast (waffle iron) was very good.
