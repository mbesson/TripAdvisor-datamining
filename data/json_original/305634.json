We new it could not be this building as it was just a concrete shell, so we started looking at the other hotels close by. None were the Grand Savur, we went back to the shell to see a small sign with the words Hotel Grand Savur on it, our hearts sunk, after approaching a Turkish builder a representative of the hotel came out and explained that the hotel was under complete refurbishment and we were being transferred to the St Shopia (a hotel in the same company group). The transfer was fine and the rep of the Grand Savur could was extremely helpful. From what we saw every thing is being replaced with new and as said before it has taken back to just a concrete shell, new windows, doors and everything. If you go this summer you will be in a brand new hotel, so all of the previous comments about the rooms will no longer be relevant.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edgewood, Maryland, United States", "Title": "\u201ctwo weeks stay\u201d", "Author": "Shahpour T", "ReviewID": "UR119889561", "Content": "The worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Dirty, nothing works. Shwer wals were so stained, It grossed me out. towels were torn on corners. rooms very small. shower very dirty. after our room was cleaned, the old soap and was still left with out being replaced. from 4 outlets in room only one worked which TV was pluged to. you couldn't be on your laptop or charge your phone or ETC with out unplugging the TV. . very expensive . for same price hotels around there offered Sona, turkish bath and massage. staff expected to be tiped even for smallst requests. no room service. if you stay there, don't use drinks from the frige, cause you will pay 4 $ for bottle of water while you can get it from corner stor for 50 cents. smelly rooms and hall ways. internet was down 3 days cause of rain. .

The location is in walking distance of attractions. In our first day we managed to walk to the grand Bazar, Spice Bazar, Blue Mosque and on to the palace from the hotel. Now the rooms are the average rooms of any three star hotel. I in no way came across the dirty rooms like other reviewers have mentioned. The bathrooms could use work. Everything works but they do look cheap. But the greatest thing about the hotel is the night staff they will go out of there way to help you. the young receptionist is both funny and very helpful. The bell boy is great for help if you can get someone to translate. Night manager helpful and willing to take time to just talk to you. Bar staff is great. If you are staying here take the time to talk to the bartender Farhod he is very friendly and more the helpful but mostly just chat with him while your having a drink. He and the rest of the night staff are definitely what make the hotel great to stay at.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cQuiet to Rest, Convenient to Tour Around, Helpful Staff in All Ways.\u201d", "Author": "JennyWongHK", "ReviewID": "UR25560228", "Content": "As a female asian individual traveller, I stayed in Grand Savur Hotel between 31/1/09 and 3/2/09. It provided a very safe, clean, comfortable & quiet environment for me to rest after each day of fascinating but tired tour. Internet service keeping me in touch with my friends. The nearby transport, especially the tramway, is so convenient that I get on everyday to the 4 towers, old city, Grand Bazzar, Eminonu ferry dock, Spice Bazzar, Domabache Palace, Tasim square, the old defence wall.........It just took 10-20minutes to different spots. The hotel is in a central spot of shopping streets(5min. walk), restaurants & money exchange(4min walk), tram & bus stops(5min walk), Aquaduct(7min walk), Cami(6min walk), police station(2min walk). The staff team was helpful in every question I asked, arranging airport transfer............If Turkish bath is needed, it's just round the corner. To get a glimps of the local residencial area, take a 10 min walk to the Aquaduct. Grand Savur Hotel is a good choice.
