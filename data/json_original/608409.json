It was a real discovery for us, and \"Honeymoom\" hotel lived up to its name. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at the companion hotel's restaurant and discovered how wonderful dining with the locals can really be. We enjoyed very comfortable accomodations, comparable to the luxury feel of a Westin, found our way around the safe and well-lit residential neighborhood nearby without any trouble, and enjoyed the close proximity to the U-bahn and S-bahn routes. Hotel reception was absolutely charming, and made us feel like old friends returning after a long time away. It was only a ten minute walk to the colorful pedestrian zone and a memorable stroll down Unter den Linden to the Brandenburg Gate, and we engaged a knowledgeable guide to show us the historical sights and memorials throughout the eastern sector on our second day. Perfect location for a visit to Berlin, especially if you plan to see much of the old East Berlin historical sights, the Stassi prison site, the majestic parliament (Reichstag),and stroll through the Tiergarten.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cvery charming\u201d", "Author": "joop1", "ReviewID": "UR99843333", "Content": "This is a very special place.

The phone itself in the room had to be rented (although once rented there was no charge for local calls). The suites were located on the 3rd and 4th floor (actually the 4th and 5th) with no one to help us up with our bags.

There's no dinner but there are some fantastic restaurants nearby, including the \"other\" Honigmond round a couple of corners.

Hegel. From my suite of rooms on the third floor (no lift! good exercise! incredibly peaceful!) I looked down into the delightful oasis of the hotel garden: its pebble paths wind past trees and flowering bushes, a bridge crosses a small fish pond. Oskar the cat keeps an eye on fish, visiting birds and hotel guests. The rooms are bright, clean, and furnished rather theatrically, with an eclectic mix of history and humour. Falling asleep I had the choice of focussing on a large gold-framed painting of a high-seas battle between pirate ships or watching the wide-screen TV. There was a generous bathroom, a small but well-equipped kitchen, and a charming sitting area. The breakfasts were excellent, the staff extremely helpful, there's a computer for guests in the reception area, and a big bowl of chocolates. In some ways the Honigmond - the name means \"honeymoon\" - offers a little less than expected (rooms without telephone, and private internet access had to be purchased) but in important ways it offers much more.

We had a large apartment one floor above ground level overlooking the garden/courtyard. The apartment was pleasantly quaint/eclectic; the recently remodeled bathroom was first-rate. The staff are exceptionally nice. The garden is a treat...we enjoyed breakfast outside every morning except when the weather forced us inside. Breakfast features an excellent selection of pastries, cereals, juices, fruit, breads, meats, and cheeses. The apartment was quiet...like silent...throughout the evening and night. The Honigmond experience was nearly flawless (assuming that kind people, good food, quiet, and a beautiful garden meet your specifications for \"flawless\"). The clientele (during our stay, anyway) was predominantly German. This observation may relate to my only criticism of the Honigmond Gardens. No credit cards; only cash or one of several EU (only) debit cards. For an international visitor this was a pain in the behind; I wound up transferring the entire amount of a 14-night stay in advance to the Honigmond's bank (at E165 per night). I have no regrets whatsoever at having done so; it just was aggravating to manage the relationship between the Honigmond; the Honigmond's bank; and my bank. This is the only downside of staying at this privately (and excellently!) managed property. And I should note as well...the location is just about perfect: at the north side of Mitte a short walk or tram-ride from Prenzlauer-berg. If, like us, you're not a great fan of traditional German food but thrive on inexpensive, international, fusion-type food, you can't beat Prenzlauer-berg.", "Date": "July 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dresden", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel, Friendly Staff, Fantastic Breakfast!!\u201d", "Author": "MissKim77", "ReviewID": "UR8689031", "Content": "This hotel is worth every penny!!

As we were there during world cup fever, the prices were much higher than usual, but less exorbitant than some of the chain hotels in the city. At the normal rate, this hotel offers excellent value for money. The location is great too, near Oranienburger strasse with lots of good restaurants and bars (try Thai Good Times restaurant at no 1 Chausseestr. which was excellent), and easy access to tube, tram or walking distance to friedrichstr. and - if you don't mind walking a bit further - the brandenburg gate.

The last night we had to move to a smaller room on the third floor. This was altogether different - I noticed that all the furninture in this room was cheap, standard IKEA. But the weakest point of the Honingmond is the service, which I found rather confusing and unprofessional.
