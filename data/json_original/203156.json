It is not a bad hotel, just that some of the rooms are old and in need of upgrade. The first visit we had a recently renovated room and it was a solid three star room. The second visit we had an older, smaller room, but it served the purpose of an overnight stay before heading home. Breakfast are not great, corn flakes, stale cheese, baloney, and no eggs. Coffee was good and plentiful though. All the hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. We left our key in the door by mistake one evening, returning many hours later and found nothing disturbed.

We booked online for one night at the Hotel Europa, a sister hotel of Hotel Nizza, and on arrival we were told by the receptionist at Hotel Europa that we were staying at Hotel Nizza and she then proceeded to give us directions to Hotel Nizza without explaining why we could not stay at the hotel we had booked. I questioned this as we had clearly booked Hotel Europa and there was nothing in the Terms and Conditions stating that they could transfer us to another hotel. The receptionist said she did not know why we had to go to a different hotel and only when pushed she went to discuss with a colleague, whereupon she returned and explained that Hotel Europa was full. Then why did their website accept further bookings? So we trudged across Rome with our luggage to Hotel Nizza, which looked a bit shabby from outside and in the main reception, but we were tired and just wanted to get out and enjoy the last night of our honeymoon in Rome so we agreed to stay at Hotel Nizza, and the receptionist demanded payment upfront. We questioned this as we had given our credit card information when we booked Hotel Europa online. The receptionist assured us that we would not be double charged and stated that we were getting a bargain paying \u20ac68 for a room at Hotel Nizza as they normally charge \u20ac170. So we were pleased with this, if a little dubious, and he gave us the key to our room. It subsequently transpired that this was a complete lie, as looking at the Hotel Nizza website, the most expensive room on offer was around \u20ac80. When we got to our room, not only was it the pokiest, shabbiest hotel room I have ever seen - it had also not been cleaned since the previous guests had left. So i returned to reception to remonstrate with the receptionist, and I told him we were not staying at the hotel and I asked for a refund of the cash paid in advance. Firstly, the receptionist assured us that there is no way we would find a room at another hotel as they would all be fully booked on the Saturday night we were there. Whilst debating this, he sent someone up to clean the room. I said that I would take my chances finding a hotel elsewhere, and that I really didn't want to spend the last day of my honeymoon in Hotel Nizza, and asked again for my money back. The receptionist said that it was not possible to give a refund on Saturdays because the administration team did not work on weekends, and we could not therefore obtain a refund until Monday. Now, I am no expert on credit card machines, but we disputed this at the time as being complete nonsense - if he can take a payment on Saturday he can also issue a refund. We have subsequently spoken to a number of other people who have confirmed that his assertion was absloute nonsense. So I left my wife in reception whilst the room was being cleaned and went off to another hotel at which we had stayed previously in Rome - Hotel Oceania, just around the corner and contrary to the receptionist's nonsensical ramblings we managed to get a room at Hotel Oceania no problem. I then returned to Hotel Nizza to collect my wife and explained to the receptionist one last time that we were not staying at Hotel Nizza and that i wanted my money back. He maintained that a refund could not be given until Monday, and I said that was no problem, I would wait for the money back so instructed him to refund the money on Monday. He said that he would do this. When we returned to England on Sunday, I emailed Hotel Nizza reminding them to issue the refund, and six weeks down the line, several emails and telephone calls later I have still not had my money back. Hotel Nizza have offered me a free night's stay as compensation - which is laughable as it is a ghastly hotel which would be my last choice of a place to sleep, and it would involve travelling to Italy again to take up their offer!! So whilst, they have basically admitted they owe me, they still refuse to issue the refund and when I threatened them that I would take the issue further they accused me of blackmail and refused to discuss the matter further. I await a detailed response from them as to: 1) Why their receptionist lied and told us that his machine could not issue refunds; 2) Why the receptionist lied and told us that he would issue the refund on Monday; 3) Why the receptionist lied and said that all other hotels in Rome would be fully booked; and 4) Why the receptionist lied about the real cost of the Hotel Nizza rooms. They refuse to answer these questions, hence the reason I have decided to leave this review. Normally, I would not leave feedback on these sites, but felt it my duty in this case, as the lack of service received from Hotel Nizza is shocking and I would really like to prevent other people from visiting (assuming all the other poor reviews on this site do not do the trick!!) I urge everyone reading this site to boycott the hotel which is shabby and completely lacks service quality. The only thing I can't fault the hotel on is location, as it is very convenient for the train station and local eateries - but there are many much nicer hotels in the area surrounding Hotel Nizza.

After reading some of the reviews on here I was dreading it. I think people need to remember when they go abroad, thats what they are doing, it isn`t like England or America. When we arrived we were early, we were greeted by a perfectly pleasent italian woman who spoke impeccable english. We asked to check in early, they were just finishing our room so we had to wait 15 minutes in the lounge area. Yes it was dated and could do with a lick of paint but was filled with lovely italian furniture which was old but in keeping with the style of Italy. We were quickly asked if we would like a drink and were given some nibbles, within 15 mins we were given our room, up to now I`m thinking what on earth are these people moaning about.

There were a few maintenance issues but nothing we couldn`t live with. The staff were pleasant and attentive, I was interested to meet the grumpy night porter but he too was perfectly pleasant with a big smile when we said hello. At the end of the day why are people so concerned with size of room, whether they had a chair, a grumpy porter etc. etc. when they are in Rome for heavens sake. Why on earth would anyone come to Rome and spend a great deal of time in their hotel room. It is a base, somewhere to sleep and wash, whats the problem. The aircon wasn`t brilliant but we just opened the windows. Yes it was slightly noisy in the morning but hey who wants to lie in in a city with so much to see. Also it is near the termini and major travel links if you don`t like noise don`t pick a hotel so close to the main station!! The breakfast left a lot to be desired but hey there are plenty of eateries and stalls very nearby. Considering the location - Its about a fifteen minute walk to many of the major attractions in Rome - and the price of the hotel what were people expecting, as far as I`m concerned if you want to have the best you pay a premium especially in Rome. This hotel is perfectly positioned for sightseeing, eating etc. as its a short distance from 3 of the main roads in Rome. If you tried to get a hotel this well positioned in London for example you wouldn`t pay less than 200 pound a night which is nothing close to what we paid for the Nizza.

Nizza Hotel is possibly the World\u2019s Filthiest, Most Disreputable Hotel! Hotel Nizza Rome is an unethical establishment that is grossly misrepresenting itself to consumers with false room pictures (aka \u201cbait & switch advertising\u201d). The rooms are filthy and ALL of the staff I spoke with could not have been ruder or less ethical. I booked two nights at Nizza Hotel, Rome through the Hotel Club website. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by a surly Reception Clerk who requested the Hotel Club voucher, our passports & the FULL payment for both of the two nights of our stay. We were then given the key to Room 119 which backed onto a dirty alley and had all the appeal a crime scene. The walls had not been painted in at least 20yrs, they were heavily watermarked with shoe print marks; the carpet was filthy with nail clippings, dirt & plaster chips all over it; the furnishings were old and tattered; the 1970\u2019s air-conditioner didn\u2019t work and bathroom fittings were falling off the walls. The room looked NOTHING like the pictures on Hotel Club (NOTE: I believe that the \u2018bait\u2019 pictures on the websites represent only a few rooms, whilst the majority of rooms are completely different.) We immediately went back to the reception desk to complain and asked see another room. I was given the key to Room 113. This room was even more disgusting than the other as it smelt of smoke, was smaller & darker. I returned this key & told the Reception Clerk that I wished to cancel my second night's stay at the hotel. I would have left immediately had I not been forced to pay for all nights up front. The manager said that I would need to speak with the Hotel Director, Alessandra who would be in reception the next morning. I asked him to make a written note of my cancellation (so that I had given the hotel adequate notice). Later that evening I went to an internet cafe to confirm my cancellation with Hotel Club as per the booking conditions. Upon returning to the hotel I informed the Night Reception Manager of my intention to check out the next morning and desire to be refunded for the second, unused night's accommodation. He was also hostile and told me that he didn't think it would be possible as the room was discounted. He also told me the Hotel Director would be in the next morning. We reluctantly went to back to the room and didn\u2019t sleep under the sheets as there were strands of hair in the bed. Yuck! The following morning we went to the reception to speak with the mysterious Hotel Director (Alessandra) who not surprisingly wasn\u2019t there. I informed yet another Reception Clerk of the events & my desire to check out that morning & be reimbursed for the second night\u2019s accommodation (which would go unused). He was very unhelpful. I asked when the Hotel Director would arrive. He said that she may not be in till the afternoon. I told him that I wished to check out that morning & resolve the matter by being credited one night's accommodation. He said that it was \u2018impossible\u2019 as the credit card machine couldn't credit funds back onto customer's cards (WHAT A LIE!). I told him that they could. He flatly refused. I asked him to call Alessandra. After much heated discussion, he phoned someone, spoke in Italian, then told me that he couldn't do it. Not because of any conditions of stay, but because of the credit card machine. This was an outright lie!! I told him that I would happily accept the refund in cash then I'd be on my way. He wouldn't do this either. I asked for the surname of Alessandra (the Hotel Director) which he said he didn't know (HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE??). Finally I told him that he & the hotel were disreputable & unethical, and that I would purse the matter through Hotel Club (aka Flairview Travel). After lodging a written complaint with Hotel Club one of their Quality Assurance Supervisors stated that they were not accustomed to dealing with such unprofessional behavior and lack of cooperation from a hotel and that their management was seriously considering the hotel's tenure on their website. Regrettably five months later Hotel Nizza is STILL listed with Hotel Club and still rated 3 stars. CRAZY! (*3 stars are defined on Hotel Club as, above average quality and range of facilities and services. All rooms will offer a good standard of comfort and equipment.) Nizza Hotel definitely does NOT meet this standard. As a goodwill gesture Hotel Club refunded my prepaid deposit and booking fee but was unable to get Nizza Hotel to refund me for my second (un-used) night\u2019s accommodation. In the words of Hotel Club, Nizza Hotel have proved to be most uncooperative. In my opinion, Nizza Hotel grossly misrepresented itself via bait & switch advertising and acted unethically. I gave both Nizza Hotel and Hotel Club adequate cancellation notice and was unfairly denied a refund. A government organization like romaturismo or turislazio, or even somebody like Enrico Gasbarra, should investigate this business & shut it down. PLEASE do yourself a favor & DON\u2019T stay here!

I could see thick dust on the dressing table, also the wardrobe was no good for hanging long garments, dresses for example as the bottom part of the wardrobe housed the mini-bar. The bath had a shower but no curtain so I usually ended up with water all over the floor. The staff were ok, not very talkative though. All in all I won't be staying in the Nizza again.", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Location": "4", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "seoul", "Title": "\u201cHorrible!!

This is an OK hotel guys! Traveling on my own to Italy for the first time, I was really scared to go to Nizza after having read the terrible reviews on this site . However, the stay proved to be surprisingly pleasant. The room was neat, spacious and clean. The room had a conditioning system and an ensuite shower/WC. The hotel itself has a beautiful, ultimately Italian, period interior. The notorious night guard proved to be a rather reserved though very pleasant and helpful man. Generally the Italians working in service sector smile half as much as the Americans/ English. If you are not ready for that, do not go to Italy, you'll come back home devastated :). However, if you do not take it personally and be polite and respectful, you will get the same in return. The only thing that was slightly disappointed with was breakfast. Compared to the English continental standard it was quite modest. However, again, keeping in mind that Italians normally have as little as an espresso and a piece of pastry for breakfast, it was quite ok. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. The location of the hotel is excellent. It's only 5 minutes walk from the train/bus/metro station and you are literally 10 minutes away from almost anywhere in Rome. If you are looking for an ultimately Italian experience and do not want to spend a fortune on the accomodation, there are good chances that you will enjoy your stay in Nizza.", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cWorst Hotel Ever!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5411610", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel last June 22 and yes all the staff are extremely rude.

When we enter the room I was very surprised because the room was very big. Bathroom is also very good with lots of towel's and they change them every day, they have hair dryer and very big mirror .You can always find hot water butt faucet is a little bit strange and it takes time to understand how it works. Just adjust temperature and let water to go for a while and you get hot water.T he hotel is at extremly good position to all metro and bus stations and all historical places, butt I sugest you to take a walk and to see all things in Rome simply just by walking because everything is very near. Breakfast is good butt after couple of days you can find it is boring. Maybe I can give a better mark I think it is betwen 3 and 4 balls. The working people in Hotel is very pleasant and always with smile.
