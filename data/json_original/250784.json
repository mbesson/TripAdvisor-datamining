Very nice, Clean and great breakfast. Well located Hello,I selected the Hotel Medium Confort for a four day stay in Barcellona (first time). We booked 3 double rooms online at the hotels website. Tip: Book directly on their website as in doing so we got a discount and free breakfast (usually 11,00 Euro each). Not knowing Barcellona I wasn't sure about this location but it is a fantastic one. Near the end Passeg di Gracias which I can only compare to walking down 5th Avenue in New York and two metro lines it is in a very nice high class residential area (similar to Greenwich Village) area. While a lot of people told me to stay near the Ramblas which is considered the center I'm really glad I didn't take their advise... that area (sorry for all the NY comparisons) is similar to staying in a Spanish version of Times square... one block is nice and the next is not with lots of tourists and tourist traps. This hotel is very nicely located and we were very pleased with everything that had to do with our stay. You have a fridge in your room and right next door is a fully stocked supermarket so we were able to get some snacks and drinks to keep in our room. The rooms were spotless as were the sheets and linens (I'm a bit picky about those things.) and the staff was very helpful. All 6 of us thought it was a great deal. Would highly recommend it!", "Date": "Nov 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR486872826", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "liveinItaly"}, {"Content": "Not central but still works Some reviewers have noted the location of the hotel as a problem but you can make it work for you. We took a two day pass for the Bus Touristic which has a stop nearby on Avinguda Diagonal and the bus can be used for transport as well as sight-seeing. There is also a metro station on Avinguda Diagonal although that is a bit further away. Perhaps not appreciated, the hotel is within 30 mins walking of Casa Mila, Casa Batllo, La Sagrada Familia, Nou Camp and Diagonal shopping. Also, there are many good restaurants and cafes close by. The coffee shop on the same street a short distance along (towards Avinguda Diagonal) was a highlight.The standard and quality of the hotel is very high and worth more than two stars. Breakfast is particularly good value. The staff are very helpful and attentive. Guests should make use of the safe/security box available at reception.

The friendly English speaking reception staff were helpful and the hotel is well maintained. Our adequately sized room faced the road but this was quiet at night and the walls seemed to be well sound-proofed so we were not disturbed by noise from adjoining rooms. The cold buffet breakfast was good with the opporunity to eat on the terrace in fine weather.We often used the Diagonal Metro station at the top end of the Passieg de Gracia which is 10 minutes walk from the hotel. This gave us cheap  quick access to anywhere in the city. The Gaudi sites of La Padrera  Casa Batllo are near this statiion and there are fine shops, restaurants  bars along the Passieg de Gracia .We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who would like to stay in the quieter, more upmarket Gracia area.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR643762361", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Bath_Rob"}, {"Content": "Lovely Hotel I thought this hotel was lovely.
