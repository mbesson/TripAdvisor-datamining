The location are very good, just some footsteps from the metro station, and this is the green line, which is the best one for seeing Barcelona attractions. That was very convenient. The biggest problem, and the reason we only rated with 3 and not 4 stars, was the restaurant and the lack of choice in the menu and some lack of quality of the food. The lack of choice was greater when they have a weekend menu (that they applied also on holidays) that only have sandwich and some bad spaghetti and only one option of desert. We had bought half board before we go and were so sorry that in the last day we went to Mac and prefer to loose the money.

Breakfast was included, and was generous for a european hotel with plentiful coffee, and fresh OJ which we americans seem to have soundly renounced in our own country.

Don't go here for the atmosphere though, it's very pleasant and relaxing to lounge in, but definitely not the place of your looking for Saturday night excitement. While you may have to signal for the bartender during slow times, once they know you are there, service is always provided with a great smile and a generous pour.

In fact, the hallways smelled a bit antiseptic, but hey, better clean than other smells! The rooms (we had a double) have windows that open to let in the breezes, great air conditioning, a full bathroom replete with every type of amenity, and a trouser press, which works as an iron for just about every article of clothing wrinkled in your suitcase. The beds are very firm. Pillows are basic hypoallergenic - no down available, but happy to give you as many as you want. The rooms were impeccably clean. Nicely laid out as well, with two single beds, a desk, place to put your luggage, an in-room safe (free), closet and nice size bathroom with shower and tub. The service was friendly, free wi-fi in the lobby (ask at the front desk), the front desk employees spoke decent English and were happy to help with everything requested. A buffet breakfast is available in the hotel. We opted to eat light and headed across the street to the local bakery, where the service sucked but the pastries were good. The hotel had better cappacino though. We ate one night in the restaurants near the hotel, but never actually ate at the hotel, so I can't comment on their food. The drinks were reasonably priced and the bar tenders happy to make a virgin pina colada for my son nightly. My son and I were very happy with this hotel, and since it took only 10 minutes by metro to get into the heart of the Ramblas, the price differental makes this hotel a true find. Plus, no noise to keep you awake at night. The metro was clean, and while everyone tells you to be careful, hold your purse in front of you (mailman style) etc., neither my teenage son nor I were bothered at any time. We found the metro to be clean, comfortable, fast and easy to figure out. The area around this hotel is filled with restaurants, a laundry service, 2 ATM's, and some stores. Nothing of major interest to \"see\" in the area, but safe enough to walk around. It's also only a few short blocks to the main train station should you want to visit Monsterrat or are heading say to Madrid. If you are going to the port, just ask the desk to call you a cab. Price from airport to this hotel ran around 25 Euro. I definitely recommend this hotel as a great place to stay.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSuper Customer Service\u201d", "Author": "Seavapor", "ReviewID": "UR114899123", "Content": "This hotel was included as part of a tour.

The access to the metro is nearly in front of the hotel. The taxi from the airport to the hotel cost me around 26 EUR. As I had no luggage, the taxi driver has offered me to leave me in front of the hotel and not at the door. I just had to cross the street. The reason is that many streets in Barcelona are one way, so if you have a lot of luggage the taxi would need to go around the neighbourhood for leaving you at the door. This will make your journey a bit longer and a bit more expensive. I have nothing special to say about the lobby of the hotel, the receptionists were friendly efficient and helpful. The room was nice but the bathroom had some bad smell that has gone after I have used the shower. I must say that I was surprised by the power of the water supply. I have never seen such a power in any hotel. It was like from a pipe filling in a swiming pool. But as the taps are good it was not difficult to adjust. So if you want a good shower, this hotel is definitely for you ;-) The mattress was comfortable, usual for Abba chain. Good quality bed linen, aslo usual for Abba. As I have stayed in this hotel only for one night and did not use any of the services, I can not say a lot more. I would say that this is a good option for those who need a reasonably priced hotel close to Plaza Sants. There are many hotels in the area, but on my opinion this one has one of the best one price/quality relationship.

Good cafes across the road but good quality meals are cheap in Barcelona typically 3 courses with wine 12 euros. Even late at night the area appeared safe - we never were aware of any hassles. The Hotel staff are friendly, polite and very helpful and the modern marble decor thoughout was spotlessly clean. Our standard double room was a king size bed with loads of space and a well appointed bathroom. Breakfast was magnificent with a buffet for as much as you wanted. We were from Scotland on a FlyGlobespan deal and could not rate the whole package any higher. If we ever go to Barcelona again it will be back to the Abba Sants.", "Date": "June 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cTry the Irish Coffee!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4955276", "Content": "The Abba Sants is not in the most obvious location in Barcelona - you're not especially close to the Ramblas or any of the other main attractions. However, it's right beside the underground and the main train line so it's incredibly easy to get around. In essence, it's a business hotel and we didn't see a great number of tourists there. The rooms have that 'business traveller' feel: they're well appointed, and definitely classier than a travelodge, but there's nothing extraordinary or special. The service was exceptional. The staff were efficient and friendly, despite our broken Spanish. At times, we felt the business clients got preferential treatment in the bar, etc, but it was hardly a problem. Particularly when they served such spectacular Irish Coffee!!! A great hotel for those visiting Barcelona on a budget. We'd certainly go back.", "Date": "April 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, Wales", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "ehm612", "ReviewID": "UR4464079", "Content": "We stayed here in May last year and it exceeded all expectations, very clean, well presented rooms, friendly staff and conveniently located next to the Metro.

There is an internet shop one block away. I paid 40 cents for fifteen minutes to check my emails. The subway stop stairs are right out the door of the hotel.

Our ages ranged from 24 to 58, so finding the right hotel that would suit everyone's tastes and expectations was going to be a challenge. The Abba Sants Hotel proved to be the perfect choice. The hotel was stunning. It was immaculately clean, the bedrooms were freshly decorated and the staff were so helpful and polite, even when it was quite obvious that we had had one to many champagne cocktails!! I would highly recommend this hotel, and would seriously consider booking again either for a romantic weekend away or for another girls weekend.", "Date": "August 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "rutland", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "RutlandKatie", "ReviewID": "UR3746448", "Content": "Just come back from a 2 night stay at the Abba Sants. Hotel in a good location for travelling from the airport and for getting around the city - the main train station (20 mins direct train link to the airport) and metro are virtually on your doorstep. Rooms are clean and functional - not what I would call 4 star, although the bathrooms are nice. We didn't find the beds that comfortable. Felt the hotel was lacking in atmosphere - had quite a 'corporate' feel and we didn't find the staff particularly friendly or helpful. The breakfasts are excellent with plenty of choice. This is an ideal hotel to use as a base for exploring Barcelona and would recommend it for a weekend stay.
