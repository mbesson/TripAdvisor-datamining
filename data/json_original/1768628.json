This hotel in my oppinion is great for over night stay, business travelers or for someone who wants quite location away from touristy areas. The rooms are modern, clean, stylish decor (very nice and unique shower) confortable beds great to relax....nice desk to work, safe;.... in general \"very nice rooms\"; also remember the AC hotels offer in their rooms conplementary frige w/ water, sodas and beer. Pros.....confortable, modern contemporary decord in all areas.... great rooms w/ modern decor good for over night transit or business travelers,....near Atocha.

AC Hotel Atocha proved particularly good value for a weekend in June - and the hotel quality certainly turned out to be a very good deal. The hotel is down by the side of Atocha station, Madrid's transport hub. Its neighbourhood,though, is more local Madrid and that bit away from the tourism maelstrom - lots of local bars and restaurants, at local prices and perhaps offering a better insight into the heart of Madrid than are maybe found in the more well known areas of the city. Hotel itself is quite new - clean and designer chic. The bedrooms are in a separate building, joined to the lobby area by a walkway and gardens. If you need time out, the garden and terrace provide a beautiful and private area where you can relax, read, have a drink or take the sun - a mini oasis, but only a stones-throw from downtown Madrid. The bedroom. What is the focal point of any hotel bedroom ? In AC Hotel, it's clearly the shower. A stylish, glass-walled shower sits proudly in the middle of the open plan bedroom, providing a divider between the bathroom area and the bedroom / living space.

Whilst the wall-to-wall wood / laminate flooring in the bedrooms looked \"modern\" it transmitted every noise in the room and acted to just amplify every sound - doors slamming, people wheeling suitcases, snoring, coughing, talking etc. The road outside the window never quietened down and refuse collection took place very noisely outside at 3am both mornings. I had little if any sleep on both nights as a result. In the lounge the next morning, a colleague and I wanted coffee whilst we were working - this wasn't available whilst breakfast was being served (until 11am) which isn't great, Alot of business people having meetings in the lounge at 9am would probably have been happy to have had the option to order a coffee.

This is literally a 5-7 minute walk from the Mendez Alvaro Exit of the Station. If you use another exit you will have to walk all around the station to find the hotel. As MR platinum I received an upgrade to superior room. Larger room with couch, floor to ceiling windows along one long side, large outdoor patio (no chairs for enjoying it though). Hotel and room decor is very very attractive but sometimes impractical. AC seems to be trying to emulate the Starwood W brand. Others have noted the glass shower in the center of the room. Lovely but very impractical for 2+ persons sharing a room if they are not intimate. Room had a safe, bathrobe, slippers. Open closet. Proper hangers. Only one electrical outlet near desk. Lighting subdued and difficult to read/see when you are working at the desk at night. I asked for a standing lamp or another desk lamp and my first request went unanswered. I asked again and the maintenance man brought up a stronger bulb but it was not much stronger. I stopped pushing and just lived with low lights. Platinum amenity was a jar of nuts, a jar of candy (i think it might have been chocolate covered nuts--not sure) or 250 points. These were same offerings as other ACs so it may be standard. I think Marriott could do better. I took the points. Internet was good for a hotel but they do inhibit streaming so I was not able to access my Schwab Edge account. Not sure if that would affect streaming on other sites. Skype worked ok--not great but I've had worse. Internet was free for me as platinum--I believe price is 20euros for 24 hours but the time does not have to be consecutive. There is free internet in the lobby for all. I did not see a hotel computer for guests to use. Breakfast was great. Large selection, freshly squeezed juice,typical spanish breakfast which I enjoyed very much. Free minibar was a nice touch although I tend to drink a lot of water so I still had to lug water from the grocery store. Minibar included 2 small still waters, 1 sparking water, 1 each peach juice, orange juice, tonic water, fanta, coke, coke light, San Miguel especial beer, a non alcoholic beer. I think if you ask at the desk they will stock minibar with your preferences each day but I did not ask. Things I wish the room had: --alarm clock or any kind of clock. --coffee or hot water pot (rare to find at all but 5* hotels in spain) --better lighting near desk (see above) --this room (5th floor) had a huge terrace. In better weather I hope they put chairs outside for people to enjoy the terrace. and lastly: -- As AC is now part of Marriott more and more Americans will be staying at their properties. I stayed at 3 AC's on this trip and none had an English newspaper (even one on a pole in lobby would have been better than nothing). All had only BBC and CNN which to me are useless stations. I think it's time for AC to add CNBC and/or Bloomberg particularly if they are trying for a business clientele. Also, they need better English speaking front desk clerks. We could barely communicate. They appeared to understand me but in view of the multiple error in info I received and on my bill I don't think they did. And someone changed one of my nights which was booked at a weekend rate to an award night without my requesting (or wanting) such. I don't know if he misunderstood something I said or did it by accident or why. My bill had multiple errors when I checked out. And when my Marriott points posted only points for one night posted even though 3 of my 4 nights were paid rates.

It was near Atocha , as we were coming in on the AVE from Barcelona later in the evening & leaving for the airport in the morning 2. They had a good price 3. I figured with Marriott brand name you can usually be guaranteed a decent bed & shower. I have to say this is a weird hotel - It is actually in 2 buildings , we had a room in the one furthest from the main desk- You go in to the lobby then have to switch lifts, walk through a conference center, outside then to another set of lifts. It was kind of a hassle with the large luggage we had. It would have been great to have at least an exit to the street from that building. The d\u00e9cor is very masculine & austere- to say the least. All black /grey, metal\u2026I like modern, but this was cold. The real tipping point for this place with me was the shower. I see others mention it but it really doesn\u2019t do it justice. .. I don\u2019t know what they were thinking . I guess you could call it a \"show shower\", yes that would be appropriate. It seemed like it was designed for Tokyo Love Motel ( not that I have been in one ) but it just seemed more peep show /hourly hotel than a 4* hotel. The shower is encased in clear glass smack in the middle of the room. \u2013 they could at least provide a curtain or something . Also the floor of it was gridded metal , which hurt my feet - after 2+ weeks of walking Madrid. Lisbon & Barcelona my feet were a bit more sensitive than usual and this was not welcome. This hotel IS close to Atocha Railstation but not that close to the Metro. There was a lot of noise in the hallway, and our window was broken from the outside when we woke up.

It is simple to get to from the airport (about a 45 minute Metro ride) and has lots of dining around the hotel. It is also close to the Prado and about a 20 minute walk to the Puerta del Sol (although we are fast walkers). We stayed in the hotel for five nights using my Marriott points. Our room was in the annex building that meant you had to take the elevator down one level, walk outside and then take the elevator in the second building to your room. Although many of the reviews talk about balconies and leather couches we had neither. Our room was small but clean, neat and modern. It was nice having the free mini bar in your room full of refreshments and it was restocked daily. The king bed was comfortable and had nice linens. The reason I marked this as a three star was this because the second night of our stay the hotel became very noisy at night/early a.m. Running, slamming doors and yelling in the hall at all hours. I did call multiple times to complain but did not get any relief from this early morning noise until our final night when at 3:30 a.m. there was a girl kicking the doors in the hall and screaming for someone to wake up and come out and party some more. This time I when called the desk and they did come up and stop the noise but it was annoying having this issue for days and never have a manager acknowledge that they were sorry we dealt with it night-after-night. Another thing was the front desk was only mildly helpful with directions/suggestions and the hotel did not have a concierge on duty during our stay. We sought other resources to get answers and suggestions to our questions during our time in Madrid. One last note worth mentioning is the shower. It is clear glass to the room. This would definitely not be suitable if you were staying as a family in the room or with friends who you don\u2019t want to parade around in front of naked.

We stayed just one night but the walk from the main reception/building to the second building was one of the most of memorable parts of the night. Dark hallways, but with bright lights highlighting modern art pieces the whole way through. And the room! Monochromatic to the core, but the design just works. And not to bury the lead, but that transparent shower is a trip and half. It is COMPLETELY transparent. There might be a switch or something to make it opaque, but like most every hotel in Spain, none of the light switches are labeled. Not that we looked for it... The point is, this is for single travelers, or couples. Not with friends or family.
