Don't stay here if you prefer large, sterile, multi national chain hotels. We stayed here for three nights and really enjoyed it. The hotel was quiet and the beds comfortable. Breakfast was your normal, basic European effort but good enough .... and for the money ... excellent. The public transport system is fantastic and this hotel is extremely close to one of the subway stations (Guntzelstrasse). You only ever have to wait five minutes for the train and after one change, you're in the heart of Berlin within twenty minutes. Buy one of the \"Welcome Cards\" for easy, very cheap travel.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMy worst hotel experience in Berlin\u201d", "Author": "silkroadmedia", "ReviewID": "UR100044488", "Content": "After eight years visiting ITB i was unlucky to book this hotel. First of all i was overcharged for 30 Euro and it just a beginning. on website it says that they accept card payment but in relalyt i was asked for cash payment which cost me additional time and foreign withdrawal bank charges. Talking about utilities: TV had no remote, Shower was not working properly, Room has no phone, NO WI-FI in hotel or internet at all. Breakfast was poor with no hot food at all. Staff useless with poor English :( Will never stay there again. Russian owner has several similar hotels in Berlin which i afraid my have same problems.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Pension Spree", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d514535-Reviews-Hotel_Pension_Spree-Berlin.html", "Price": "$46 - $98*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Trautenaustrasse 19</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10717</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "514535", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/6b/1f/6b1f42ee454ee6a5dd52d0cd7439f4895large.jpg"}}
