We took the Alilaguna water taxi from the airport to the Rialto bridge stop and, from there, it was about a four minute walk to the hotel. We arrived at around 1pm and were greeted very warmly and showed to our room right away. The staff, without exception, were very nice, helpful and professional. The hotel and room were immaculate and the whole place was obviously very well cared for. The rooms are typical for Europe in size, but very opulent. We had a King bed with high quality linens and drapes, and ornate, polished decorations like Murano glass wall mounted chandeliers. The bathroom was huge and even more lavish than the room with, among other things, towel warmers and a 12\" diameter shower head. I was surprised at the quality of the place because I booked it through an online tour company and it was an upgrade that cost only a little more per night (about $25) than the bargain rate place, located on Lido Island, suggested on the original itinerary. I should also mention that the package included the hotels buffet breakfast which was excellent; fresh food and plenty of variety. I don't spend a lot of time in hotels when I travel, so all of the stuff I just mentioned was just a bonus to me. The location of the hotel was the best part of the experience for us. It is a perfect base point to make any destination on the island comfortably accessible by foot. My wife and I walked everywhere in Venice from that hotel and did this at quite a leisurly pace. It is minutes, literally steps, to the Rialto Bridge where you can cross the canal on foot, or jump on the water taxi. Minutes in the other direction and you will be in San Marco Square and everything that has to offer. On two evenings we walked from the hotel to the Cannaregio*** for dinner and the walk back was just right to help get the blood flowing again after a great Italian meal. If you don't wish to wander too far from La Commedia, there is shopping, dining and entertainment ( Teatro Goldoni) in the immediate vicinity. One evening we saw a bit of Vivaldi performed by a small string ensemble in a church around the corner from the hotel, which was very enjoyable. If I return to Venice any time soon I would, without question, stay at La Commedia. ***I highly recommend the Cannaregio, by the way, if you want to get off the beaten track and venture where few tourists ever seem to go. Here you will find restaurants and cafes along the Fondamenta Misericordia and Rio di S.Girolamo that are the real deal and frequented by locals. If you go during the day and early evening, it's very peaceful. Later at night (after 9pm), some of the places get very busy, so plan accordingly.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Yorkshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Place to Stay in Venice\u201d", "Author": "Steve7887", "ReviewID": "UR128214407", "Content": "We booked through Citalia, flew with Jet2 from Manchester, and used the Alilaguna water bus from the airport to Rialto. The directions given on the hotel's website were very clear and it was easy to find - literally a two-minute walk with no bridges to cross. The greeting could not have been warmer, with a very efficient reception. A member of staff took us up in the excellent lift to our room on the first floor. The room was an elegant gold and cream, very tasteful and restful. There was loads of space, with a desk, table and two easy chairs as well as the canopied bed. The bathroom was well appointed with plenty of space around the washbasin, a bath with both a hand shower and a fixed overhead one, and a bidet. There was good drawer and hanging space, certainly adequate for two people for a week. The cupboard contained a large electronic safe. There was also a well stocked mini-bar, with no restrictions on keeping your own water in it. The room was at the back of the hotel, with double-glazed windows overlooking a normally quiet lane. The room was cleaned and tidied each day, and bedding turned down in the evening, with a couple of sweets left on a card with the next day's weather forecast - a lovely touch. The bar was friendly, warm and comfortable, with plenty of atmosphere. The price of drinks was not excessive when compared to the usual high cost of alcohol in Venice. Breakfast was the usual continental mix of fresh fruit, yoghurt, cold meats and cheeses, with a variety of cereals, breads and crackers. There was also scrambled eggs and bacon - we didn't ask for anything extra, but I guess they would have cooked eggs to order. Tea or coffee was served at the table (the coffee, of course, was excellent)! La Commedia is perfectly situated, being two minutes from Rialto and 10 minutes from St Mark's Square. There are plenty of restaurants and shops on the way to Piazza St Marco. The staff were friendly and helpful at all times, and spoke excellent English. Checkout was smart and efficient, with no delay. I have no hesitation in thoroughly recommending Hotel a la Commedia for any length of stay in Venice.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, IN", "Title": "\u201cGreat luxury for our last stop in Italy\u201d", "Author": "Stephen S", "ReviewID": "UR127999954", "Content": "Our travel agent, Beach Bum Lisa, picked the La Commedia for us as our last stop on our first anniversary trip thru Italy.

The front desk staff was as expected, very nice and knowledgeable, and even helped us save a little money by arranging a group gondola ride with other guests at their hotel. La Commedia was very well kept and met all of our expectations, even exceeded them with the gold inlay in the bathroom floors. I don't know why, but that still sticks with me even after our entire trip through Italy. I guess it was just symbolic of just how much La Commedia personified luxury, even though we tried to travel on a budget.

I paid for the airport to hotel transfer as I had saved for a long time for this trip and was doing it in style. The trip from the airport to the hotel was fantastic - private water taxi surfing the waves and throwing up spray all the way - it was so exhilarating. Then coming in under the Rialto Bridge and being met by a hotel staff member to lug my suitcase and show me to the hotel. On the way back to the airport they took me through the Grand Canal so I could get a last look at the beauty of Venice. The transfer is very expensive however and it is unlikely I will utilise it again. Also, the hotel says that included in the transfer are some guided activities - a gondola ride, a walking tour. They actually aren't included though, the hotel will get you a subsidised rate. I ended up taking part in none of the activities and they should ensure they cease giving the impression that these activities are going to be free. This is my only issue with La Commedia and is solved by me not using the transfer service again. Everything else was wonderful. They upgraded me to a Junior Suite on arrival and it was lovely. Spacious, clean, well appointed and plush. There was a turn down service every day which left me a chocolate and tomorrow's weather report - very handy. The bathroom was large, clean and had an overhead as well as handheld shower option over the bath. Fantastic for an Aussie traveller. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and I was given a stamp for a free drink in their bar. It is just a small area in the foyer but it was perfectly nice and provided a good place for me to write up my experiences at the end of the day. (Unfortunately the rooftop bar only opens in Summer). The breakfast room was nice and the breakfast provided was everything I needed and more. Cereal, pastries, fruit, tea etc that I partook of, and extras like eggs and bacon for those that prefer a more hearty breakfast. Again the staff were very attentive and helpful. The restaurant next door to the hotel whilst outside of my usual price range provided a lovely last evening's meal and the waitstaff there are fantastic. If I manage to save enough money to be able to afford high luxury again on my next trip I will definitely be staying at La Commedia.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Venice\u201d", "Author": "Linda0z", "ReviewID": "UR127695927", "Content": "A hidden gem and possibly the best city centre hotel I have ever stayed in.

It's down a side street, so don't expect views. Also, most of the hotel is situated above ground floor shops and bars, so if you are given a room on the 1st floor, make sure it is not above the snack bar Torino (parts of room 115 definitely are). We had this room on the first night of our 4 night stay, and were kept awake well into the early hours of the morning with very loud music. The night receptionist's response felt scripted and well rehearsed yet the management's response the next morning when we asked for a change of room was that it was an unusual occurrence. Whether the bar usually plays music so late may be debatable, but they certainly were playing loud music when we passed by later during our stay so if you want to retire early after pounding the streets, ask for a room on the upper levels and/or near the breakfast room. That said, the rooms were well appointed (excellent beds) and extremely clean and the breakfast provided was of a good quality. To get to the hotel from the airport we took public transport (vaporetto - Alilagune linea arancia). With hindsight, we should have taken a water taxi...we had to wait 30 mins for the departure and it took another 60 mins to get there, stuck inside a hot, stuffy cabin with a limited view.

We chose this hotel after reading the fantastic reviews. First of all we had been undecisive about how to get to the hotel, whether to book a water taxi (at \u00c2\u00a350 one way for a shared boat it's not cheap) or whether to wait for the Vaporetto (water bus) - we decided to arrive in style in the speedboat water taxi option and I'm so glad we did - what a way to arrive into the city! The water taxi was waiting for us with 2 other couples and we sped straight off! The hotel is literally a 2 minute walk from the Rialto Bridge which is where we got dropped off and is really easy to find. We were upgraded to a suite which was a nice surprise - the rooms are gorgeous and spacious with a lovely bathroom and very clean. The cleaner also turns your bed for you at night and leaves chocolates and the weather forecast for the next day on the bed. We were on the third floor and the room was really quiet both from outside noise (and there is a constant stream of people walking by) and from other occupants of the hotel. Breakfast is a great start to the day, fruit juices, tea/coffee, cereal, cold meats, cheese, fresh fruit, yoghurt, scrambled egg, bacon, croissants, bread rolls, biscuits. San Marco square is a 5 minute walk away. We also went on a gondalier ride which we caught at the back of San Marco square for 80 euros - obviously very expensive but well worth it for 40 minutes. Be sure to haggle as the original price started at 120 euros! We ate at Hard Rock Cafe the first night, bottle of wine, starter between us and 2 mains cost 65 euros and the second night we ate at Da Mamo which has also been recommended on Trip Advisor. We both had pizza which was delicious but we weren't that keen on the environment as the tables are pushed so close together you feel like you are having dinner with the couple next to you - food was tasty though and at reasonable prices.

Perfectly located around the corner of the Rialto bridge were the water taxi drops you off. The room was very pretty and well decorated with beautiful fresh white linen. The bathroom is all marble with double sinks it seemed like it had just been renovated, with bathrobes, toiletteries, beautiful towels etc. The hotel is located in the heart of all the shops and cafes, and a 5 or 6 minutes walk to Plaza St. Marco. The staff was very efficient, and polite as well as very helpfull, with any questions we had. The breakfast was included and was excellent, with beautiful china and cutlery, and crisp white table clothes. The food selection was just what you needed fruits, cheeses, cerearl, croissants, danishes and the regular scrambled and boiled eggs, bacon etc and all very nicely presented . Of course espressos, cappucinos, and all kinds of teas are served as well. It's not a sumptuous hotel like the (Ritz) but on a smaller scale it's an excellent 4* with pretty rooms and great amenities. The only negative if I have to mention one is that there is no great views from the windows. All the buildings are close together, so there is no landscape views. The staff was very sweet, on our last day we had to checkout early because of our flight, they prepared us 2 breakfast bags full of food, we couldn't finish half of it.

Venice is a fantastic city at that time of year. Hotel is very well located as noted by other reviewers. We received good directions to the hotel from the Cruise Ship port. It did take a while to get there though. Immediate help with luggage and good advice on places to eat and visit from the front desk. Lorenzo and others were very friendly - be specific on what you want & they'll give good honest answers and advice. As others have noted the \"Free water taxi to the Murano Glass factory\" is an arrangement to have the glass factory sell you glass. Liked the toiletries in the Bathroom - but it is \"BYO Conditioner\". Also no coffee maker or iron in the room. WI-Fi connection was solid. I told them I needed to be on Wi-Fi for much of the time I'd be there because I was working and they comped me 48 hours of wi-fi.Bed was not too hard but firm; AC worked and was not noisy. Room was fine- not too small not overly big either. Maybe 3 channels on the TV in English. No Workout room - but you will walk plenty in Venice. Free Breakfast was nice- serve yourself except for very good (strong) Italian Coffee . Waitstaff is professional and efficient at cleaning tables and bringing coffee. Excellent Croissants, cold cereal, yougurt and fruit, juice and breakfast bars. Really all you need. Also many great coffee and pastry places and bars within 2-3 blocks. It wasn't cheap - about $330 Euros/night. Ate a true Venetian meal at Bistro De Venice nearby one night - expensive but worth it for a treat (about 170 Euro for two with tip). There is no good pizza in Venice - we looked! But many other better options for snacks and meals. Hotel provided help with luggage and arranging a water taxi to the airport (70 euros). If the weather is nice buy an all day Vaporetto pass (16 euro) and take Vaporetto #1 up and down the Grand Canal and around the island from the Grand Rialto stop near the hotel. Hotel was very clean - public areas and your room.

It's well located, perfect for Rialto and St Marks Square, only a few stops on the vaporetto from the bus or rail terminal (get off at Rialto stop, hotel is situated just behind, through a very narrow alley). Very clean comfortable rooms, although the beds are a little on the small side - they were too short for tall guests. We stayed at 4 star AD Place previously and the beds were huge in comparison. No information book in our room which would have been useful. Poor bathroom toiletries, bath foam in a room with only a shower for example. Lift to each floor which is a bonus in Venice. Wifi is free for 30 mins but then charged after. This is a joke in a 4 star hotel, plus the signal kept dropping. Instead, take a short walk to Devil's Forest Pub, order a drink and get the wifi code - it's free so better value than the hotel, plus it's a great little place to relax. Hotel has a 'no iron' policy meaning if you don't iron all your clothes before travelling, you'll be walking around Venice looking like you slept in them! We requested an iron from reception only to be told 'it's a Venice security policy, no irons in the hotels'. What a load of nonsense! (We had an iron at AD Place the previous year). The staff were professional enough, but not as warm as other hotels we've stayed in. We got caught out by the 'free trip to the Murano glass factory' tour, but it's actually a sales event rather than a genuine factory tour. You meet at reception, get guided to a water taxi which takes you to Murano free of charge (warning bells should have been ringing at this point - water taxis always get paid somehow!). You are met by sharp suited salesmen who take you to watch the 'masters at work' (overweight bored looking chaps with cigarettes hanging from the corners of their mouths), before being directed to the merchandise where another salesman splits the selling duties. Some of the glass is beautiful, but the prices are eye watering! In fact, you will pay a 3rd the price buying the exact same glass elsewhere - don't get conned! I appreciate this isn't the hotel, but it is the commission earning hotel staff who will push the tour to you! Anyway, back to the hotel review - breakfast is good, limited hot choice of eggs and soggy bacon, but the staff were pleasant enough. The rooftop bar was closed when we visited, but the lobby bar is a nice place to relax, with leisurely service (the barman seemed to always be elsewhere in the hotel and needed to be summoned to do his job?). We didn't dislike the hotel, but didn't love it either. It may seem picky, but this is an expensive hotel and it's the little things that count (like free wifi and ironed clothes!). There are so many hotels in Venice with those services so we won't be staying again.

It's best to just avoid and let it stay in your mind as this romantic, clean place where the people are nice. In reality it's a dump that quickly brings you to the realization as to why it's such a terrible idea to build a \"city on the water\" with no roads. But this review shouldn't be about Venice, so on with the hotel ... The hotel property itself is actually quite nice. Sure there are no views, but I don't think there are many views to be had in this city in the first place (as already mentioned!). The room was very expensive, but you probably already knew that when you started reading this review. But the room was very nice, very spacious. However, there's so much more to a hotel than just the room and the property ... The staff really ruined this place for us. We didn't understand the whole parking-at-the-airport, taking the bus into the train terminal area, and then getting on the dumb water bus thing to get there in advance (all our fault for not doing homework), so it took us a very long time to get there (in a heat wave of about 95 degree heat with 80% humidity). If you can picture it, we were sweaty, tired, and a bit frustrated by the difficulty one has navigating a city with no streets (and instead a hodge podge of alleys). But we finally arrive, and immediately the upselling starts. We ask about where to find the best pizza in town (not knowing that Venice is not really known for pizza). The gentleman behind the desk (an overweight Joey Fatone, you'll recognize him if you go there!) immediately breaks into an annoying sales pitch - \"well, pizza in Venice is no good, you see ... I like to recommend my personal favorite restaurant ...\" as he slides open a drawer with probably a couple hundred business cards all from the same restaurant. Needless to say, the hotel was getting a cut on this. Then he proceeds to tell us \"perhaps you want to take a gondola ride in the canal, I will make a reservation for you with my personal favorite!\", followed by \"Americans love to go on a tour of the local glass making island (Murano), I will arrange a fabulous trip!\" Basically, this guy didn't realize it but he was doing an anti-sales job with us. We wanted nothing to do with what he was selling us. And because you have to leave your key at the front desk (it's one of those places), you're bound to have many encounters with them trying to sell you everything. Last, before I go, let me plead one more time with you to avoid Venice altogether. There were beggars everywhere, human feces in the alleys (when a beggar's gotta go, a beggar's gotta go!), and it's an absolute nightmare to get around. All for what? There really aren't even very many things to do in Venice, unless you're really into buying touristy stuff made in China. There's no beach. The reason people go to Venice is because \"it's a city on the water\" and as such it's a novelty for that. But it's a bad novelty. It'd be like going on a vacation to a Turkish prison, just because it's a Turkish prison. There are far better places to go in Italy, and - better yet - there's a relatively unknown gem about 2h30m away ... Ljubljana. I can't say enough positive things about that city and that country.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murfreesboro, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service!\u201d", "Author": "LZeisloft", "ReviewID": "UR118658304", "Content": "Stayed at this great hotel for three days this September and had a very enjoyable stay!

Room was beautiful, we stayed in a room which had a separate lounge area. Very spacious even if it didn't have a lounge area. Turn down service is twice a day. Marble bathroom is a good size with great shower. Buffet breakfast had a great selection, it's cold breakfast which is the norm in Venice/Italy.

Although the reception staff were polite but perhaps somewhat unfriendly, not sure if it was because we refused the offer of the trip to Murano and the shared gondola ride. Breakfast was ok but have had more variety at other hotels and quite often we had to ask for jugs of juice or the basket with the croissants to be refilled and the service was slow and the staff forgetful. The staff seem to multi task, one day waitering, next security,and another day reception duty. Venice is expensive but many resturants have a tourist menu and there are plenty of sandwich bars. Obviously Venice in July is crowded and hot but didn't smell as we thought it might and we never saw a mozzie but lots of people had bites on legs and arms.

As we were traveling with our adult daughter we had a junior suite and it was more than large enough for the three of us with room to spare. The bathroom was luxuriously large and we loved the large, thick towels. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and more than enough to satisfy our tastes. Our room was well appointed and very comfortable. The location of this hotel, as mentioned in previous reviews, is perfect. Only a short 8 or so minute walk to St. Mark's and the Doge's Palace one direction and just steps from the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge in the other direction. It's very quiet and away from the huge crowds, something we truly appreciated. If I may say a word about Lorenzo at the front desk. What a treasure he was, and such a help to us! If you go, listen to his restaurant recommendations - they were spot on and just exactly what we were looking for each of our three nights. The hotel also offers transportation to Murano and a tour of a glass factory. We did this and were extremely happy we did. We were NOT pressured in any way at the factory to buy and very much enjoyed the tour. If we are ever fortunate enough to go back to Venice we would never consider staying anywhere else.

The Grand Canal is less than 2 minutes walk from the hotel if you are arriving from the airport used the Orange line Aliaguna water bus its 25 Euro return and stops at the Rialto the walk is about 200 mtrs to the hotel. To see the Grand Canal on a budget buy a 12 hour pass( 16E) and sit on the No 1 water bus it tours the Grand Canal and takes in each stop eventually taking you to the Lido you can stay on and return and see the canal again. You can use this pass to take you the the Islands as well as all the Venice area its great value. If you have the time take the LN to Burano you won't be disappointed.

We were not disappointed. We had previously arranged a private water taxi from the airport and were dropped off at a jetty not far from the Rialto Bridge. The hotel was between 50 - 100 metres from the jetty and also very close to many lovely shops, including the only Department store in Venice and lots of cafes and restaurants. All of the staff were very courteous, pleasant and very helpful with our numerous queries. The rooms were clean, beautifully furnished, well maintained and (very importantly) nice and warm as the weather was cold for the duration of our stay and snowed in the middle of our visit). Judging from the dining room at breakfast time, the hotel was pleasantly busy during our stay. Only one morning we had to wait for a table for four, but that was down to selfish couples sitting at tables for 4 as there were spare tables for 2. I see from some previous reviews that some people weren't happy that cooked breakfast was an additional cost, but the buffet was more than enough for each of us in our party (various cold meats, cheeses, hard boiled eggs, fruit salad, fresh fruits, rolls, croissants and a nice (but very sweet) almond tart. Whilst there were only 2 waiting staff, they made a good job of replenishing teas, coffees and the buffet itself. By the second day we had acquainted ourselves of the San Marco area and, whilst distances seemed further on the map, it was only taking us around 7 minutes to get from the hotel to St Mark's Square if we were running late for dinner, but longer on the way back when window shopping in preparation for the shopping expedition the next day! On our departure we could have taken the Vaporetto to the airport but decided to take the water taxi again. The hotel booked it for us and it picked us up from the Vaporetto stop as the jetty was still very snowed up. It was more than 30 years since I had last been to Venice and I can't wait to go back again. When I return I certainly plan to stay at La Commedia again.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London,UK", "Title": "\u201cPleasant, efficient, brilliant location\u201d", "Author": "MikeS00", "ReviewID": "UR91192929", "Content": "A couple of minutes from the Rialto, direct link to airport and vaporetto services in the city.

We took a private water taxi from the airport as there was a group of 4 travelling and the departure time of the Alilaguna boat meant that we would have had to wait 40-45 minutes for the boat and then make a number of stops on the way to the Rialto which at this time of the year in the freezing cold is not a good idea. We paid 100 euros which I must say I didn't think was bad as within 15 minutes or so we were at the landing stage at the bottom of the little alley that leads directly to the hotel and which is probably only 80 - 100 yards away from the canal. The hotel is a great choice in terms of position, minutes from the Rialto Bridge and by the time we were due to leave we had found a way through to St Marco which took us 5 minutes (at night) although during the day a lot longer due to window shopping and menu reading outside establishments. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the rooms were lovely, all decorated in shades of cream and gold with canopies over the beds and choices of lighting from the tiniest of reading lights through to canopy, overhead and table lamps either separately or all together. There was plenty of hanging and shelf space, desk space and a small table and armchairs if you wanted to take your breakfast in your room. A nice large bed and although I am definitely a duvet person the blanket was not too heavy and there was spare pillows and blankets in the cupboard. There is a C.D. player in the room, hairdryer in the bathroom and a minibar and whilst there was no Wifi in the room it was not a problem for us as ours was a social visit and not business. We couldn't increase the temperature in our room but as soon as we told the reception that we had a problem they were able to confirm that the room temperature did not match the figure that we had requested as they have some way of reviewing it in the reception. When we came back in the evening it had been resolved and the room was really very warm. Breakfast every morning was just great, I don't hold with the need for bacon and eggs etc, after all this was Italy and a continental breakfast done well is a nice way to start the day. I actually found the choice of food excellent, there were 3 types of cereal, a couple of juices plus large jugs of water and milk. There were hard boiled eggs, at least 6 types of cheese, speck, mortadella and ham as well as brown or white bread rolls, 2 types of croissant and biscuits for cheese etc. or sweet biscuits. Assorted fruits were available either as a fresh fruit salad, pineapple and kiwi plus a large tray of apples, bananas and oranges. Yoghurts, marmalade, jams, honey and Nuttella spread were also on the buffet. The service in the dining room was immpeccable, the 2 members of staff kept the table filled and served you with as much tea, coffee and chocolate as you wanted. When they found out it was my birthday a small gift was even forthcoming. The reception staff were friendly and welcoming and the bar was very cosy. It was a great choice and thanks to the people that posted their reviews and pictures. Would I stay there again, yes without a doubt, I loved the area which was so central for everything that we wished to do. Having stayed previously closer to St Marks square, I much prefered the position of the A La Commedia which gave quick access to San Polo and Dorsoduro as well as Castello and Canneregio.

The front desk staff were generally fabulous -- especially Frederico and Roberto, who were extremely knowledgeable and helpful.

We disembarked the boat and took a free shuttle back to Piazzale Roma. We thought about taking the vaporetto but decided to walk (we only had two light bags). It took about 20 minutes with stops to take photos and get drinks. It wasn't a bad walk since it was early in the morning, cool and not crowded at all. We crossed the Rialto bridge and 4 minutes later, we arrived at the hotel. The room wasn't ready since we were so early and the concierge told us that they were awaiting some checkouts. We registered and left our bags and went to explore the area. St. Mark's square (San Marco) was very close. We walked along the canal and found some neat places to eat lunch. We love the location of the hotel! We walked back to the hotel at 3pm (check in is 2pm) and we were given our key.

Free buffet breakfast was adequate (cereal, croissants, deli meats, bread, jams, coffee, teas, juice, and water--- you can pay for mor ecooked foods like eggs). We took the vaporetto at the Rialto Bridge to Piazzale Roma for 6.50 Euros each and then paid 3 Euros (get tickets at the bus terminal not at actv) to take a direct bus (D2 bus waiting area) to the airport. It took us about an hour from hotel to airport (but we didn't have to really wait for water bus or express bus). But we definitely recommend this hotel!!

My husband and I just returned from an awesome stay at the Hotel a la Commedia and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to Venice. Here are the details of our stay: ROOM: The rooms are exactly as pictured on their website. We booked a Junior Suite which could easily accommodate 5 people. It was a spacious, elegant, tastefully decorated room with a King size bed and walkout from bedroom to balcony, a reading light on both sides of the bed, 2 large mirrored closets, sitting area with pull-out couch, 2 flat screen tv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, mini-bar and in-room safe. The room also had a huge bathroom fully equipped with double sinks, hair dryer, magnifying mirror, toilet, bidet, deep soaking tub with rainshower showerhead and also hand held shower, clothes line, heated towel rack, stool, bathrobes and slippers. We had no problem with the water pressure or getting hot water. Entry to the room was by electronic key with a huge gold tassel on the end, not a magnetic card! Something we have never seen before. HOTEL: The lobby contained a small entrance area with a two person check in desk on one side and a bar with seating area on the other side. Hotel staff were friendly and efficient. The small elevator up to the rooms was awesome with dark smoked glass mirrors and a roof that mimicked a starry night sky. Something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen anywhere else. The hotel also had a rooftop bar where you could go to relax and have a drink. Unfortunately, it was closed during our stay due to bad weather. Our room rate included a buffet breakfast, which included cereals, cold meats, pastries, fresh juices, cookies and fresh cut fruit. Eggs could be ordered for an additional 3.50 Euro - a far cry from the 50 Euro charged for breakfast by other hotels. Breakfast was served in their elegant breakfast room. The Front Desk also arranges one way trips to Murano as well as gondola rides. We took the trip to Murano and it was well worth the trip. The hotel arranged a private water taxi ride to the island where we watched a demonstration on how they create their glass masterpieces. From there we were taken to the factory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showroom where all their pieces were displayed. No high pressure sales pitch ensued. Their unique masterpieces on the second floor were out of this world and so were the prices. But one thing for sure, the quality was far superior to that of the other factories on the island. We also took the gondola ride arranged by the front desk. That in our opinion was a bit of a rip-off. We were charged 30 Euro each for a 40 minute ride and shared the ride with four other hotel guests. The ride itself was great, with the gondolier pointing out various points of interest and providing historical details. We later went back to the same gondola stand to inquire about rates which we found out was actually 80 Euro for the boat for a 30 minute ride. Advice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the two of you traveling, spend the extra 20 Euro and get a nice romantic gondola ride for just the two of you. LOCATION AND DIRECTIONS: Hotel a la Commedia is conveniently located close to Rialto Bridge and all other tourist attractions as well as within 10 minutes of Piazza San Marco. It can be reached either by ACTV line 1 or 2, but line 1 is your better option. When we first arrived in Venice, we took line 2 which seemed to be an express waterbus to Rialto. However, when we got off at the Rialto stop, it was further away from the hotel. Although it was no more than a 5 minute walk, we had to drag our luggage over a small bridge with steps on both sides. We later took line 1 and found that the Rialto stop for that line was closer to the hotel (only 2 minutes) with no bridges to cross. Just be careful NOT TO GET OFF AT THE RIALTO MERCADO stop. That stop is on the opposite side of the Grand Canal and you would have to drag your luggage across the Rialto Bridge or get back on the ACTV to get off at the next Rialto stop. All in all we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay at the Hotel a la Commedia and would return again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "Title": "\u201cHotel simply superb\u201d", "Author": "Mr_Mrs_G_Thompson", "ReviewID": "UR65031386", "Content": "Booked a few days in the romantic city of Venice, as a wedding anniversary celebration.

We chose A La Commedia because of all the great reviews not just on tripadvisor but on expedia and other review sites. Plus the pictures of the hotel and rooms looked impressive. I don't know if it was just our badluck that we've been given a room where it did not live up to expectations. Compared to the first hotel (palace bonvecchiati) we stayed in on our first trip to Venice this was no where near that. We chose 2 nights in the classic standard double, though not all is bad and I do want to give a fair assessment so onto the good stuff first - Staff Very friendly and on hand to make us feel welcomed. They mustve checked our records when they took photocopies of our passports because on my wifes birthday, one of the staff popped up to our room and gave us a complimentary bag of cookies. Now that is being thoughtful. Location and Value In an excellent location just round the corner from the Rialto Bridge and only 10mins walk to San Marco square so this would be dead center in the tourism attraction areas. It is probably one of the cheapest 4* hotels you will be able to find in that area. Design & Decor It is nice clean hotel and the decor is very \"Venice\". It has a gold theme throughout which makes it feel quite luxurious and prestigious. Ok so my review looks all good so far, but most importantly is the experience with the your room and unfortunately, this is where its starts going wrong - No bath tub! I dont know how many rooms in the hotel actually has a bath tub en-suite but we was unlucky enough to be given one with a shower ensuite. Thats a no no for me as there would be nothing better than to relax in a bath full of water after a long day's walk in Venice. Maybe because of the no bathtub thing, I then started to get a little critical about the room. - The room size was actually very small - No kettle in room hence and no complimentary coffee/tea sachets, for a 4* hotel this should be easy - TV Channels was just local, probably 1 or 2 english channels but there was no menu for hotel premium channels such as movies or internet - Hotel Info folder that you normally get with the usual hotel services or local info. This had nothing in it but the do not disturbed/make room tags. Why call it an info folder when there is no info in it? - Ok normally in the bathroom you get real glass cup for toohbrushing right? We got a couple of clear plastic cups! I know these are small things I'm moaning about but for a 4* hotel, these small things should be super easy. For me, this hotel was more a 3* and does not deserve to be hyped about. Once in this hotel is enough for me, I definitely would not revisit.

Those who like a hot breakfast can ask for one to be prepared for a fee. The front desk staff were always polite and helpful. They even organised a gondola tour for 25 euros per person, although this meant having to share the gondola with other hotel guests. Venice is a beatiful place but can be very hectic and expensive, so finding a hotel which you can happily return to at the end of a tiring day is priceless. If the hotel could improve on something, it would be to open up the breakfast room for evening dining. Despite this very minor issue, I would happily return again!", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cperfect spot for 3 days in venice\u201d", "Author": "goodcookie", "ReviewID": "UR51537103", "Content": "what a gem! lovely hotel, just a block or so from the vaporetto #1 stop and a very short walk to St. Marks Square.

The servers at breakfast (they serve you coffee or items off an additional cost menu which was expansive and reasonably priced), were very professional. Rooms were excellent - large, expansive marble bathroom, flatscreen tv, etc. The bed is a European bed (two twins put togehter t create a king size with a king size blankets and linens.) The mattress was hard and pillows low and hard. This is a typical Europen setup, so I cannot fault the hotel. One recommendation is for the hotel to designate a few rooms and have softer pillows and matresses there for American travleers and just charge more for those rooms ( a good night sleep is priceless.) Location was perfect (extrememly close to the Realto bridge as well as St Marco Square). The fact that there are no canal views is not a problem, a you see them all day long and being set back allows the hotel to be a bit quiter.

I booked for seven nights and based on that longer stay and my previous experience with very small rooms in European hotels, I decided to pay extra for a larger junior suite. I even confirmed this reservation with the hotel a week before arriving. When I checked in around 9:00 a.m. the desk clerk confirmed that I had a Junior suite but the room would not be ready until around 2:00 p.m. This was OK with me since I did not expect the room to be available that early. When I returned to the hotel later in the afternoon, the clerk said my room was now ready and a bell person escorted me to room 403 on the top floor. Although the room looked very nice and large enough I immediately noticed that it was definitely not a junior suite. I know that I should have immediately gone back to the check in clerk and rectified the situation, but I was so tired after the long airline flight and the room actually looked very nice and was plenty big enough for one person that I decided not to pursue the issue and get my trip off to a negative start. I never did find out why this happened, but my assigned room was so nice that I let it go. I only mention it here so that others are aware of this possibly happening to them, particularly if they are a solo traveler. In addition to this service issue, I also purchased 30 minutes of internet time for 8 euros. The wireless connection in my room worked well the first night, but then would not connect the next day. When I reported this to the desk clerk he just replied that the internet worked OK at his desk, but made no effort to fix the problem in my room. The internet was not crucial for me so I let this go also.

Venice is a beautiful city - although it is slightly faded elegance in parts - and this hotel stands out partially because it isn't faded at all (it is only about 5 years old - a rennovated bank building apparently) and partially because of its ideal location for all tourists. We had been recommended this hotel by friends and we weren't dissappointed (the trip advisor reviews were all positive too!) It isn't a cheap hotel but then no hotel in central Venice is! We booked online directly with the hotel website, and It really is worthwhile - they offer an 'early-bird' discount which was substantial and only available on their site. You had to agree that you couldn't get a refund if you cancelled and that you would pay for the room immediately on booking, but effectively we paid (for an upgraded deluxe room) for three nights only slightly more than the tariff rate for a standard room for one night. Breakfast is included in the price and is served in their elegant little breakfast room - I recommend the croissants! The location of the hotel is perfect, it really is less than a 5 minute walk away from the Rialto Bridge water bus stop (perfect is you have cases!); 5 minutes from the Rialto Bridge itself and about 10 minutes( depending upon how lost you get!) from St Marks Square. The hotel, other than the entrance, is above a street of designer shops just beside a lovely little square that has the best bakery imaginable! My recommendations for Venice are: * take comfortable shoes because you'll need them as you walk everywhere all the time! * forget about smart clothes to change for dinner because no-one does; * Try the spritz (it's the venetian speciality drink - you'll see everyone drinking it!); * try the bellini (peach & champagne drink); * if your budget will stretch (and I do mean stretch!) then go on a gondola ride, earlyish in the morning if you don't want your photo taken by everyone, it really is worth the money; * take a trip to Murano either on the waterbus or even better the glass factories will offer you a free water taxi ride out there if you loiter around St Marks Square(!) and then you only have to pay for the waterbus back - it is very beautiful island and if you love glass take your credit card! * If you are limited in time visit the Rialto Market early morning to see the fish & vegetable markets then onto the Basillica; have lunch in the Stable Bar in the Doge's Palace and finally go to the top of the Campanile for amazing view of Venice and the mountains on the mainland. Touristy I know but its the highlights of the city for those only there for the weekend; * Finally and most importantly take lots of money! Venice is not for those on a budget - we walked everywhere and maybe things were inflated in price because of the carnival but you won't get change of of 10 euros for two cups of coffee anywhere (make that 20 euros in St Marks Square!)", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, wonderful location\u201d", "Author": "beazerChicago", "ReviewID": "UR26117544", "Content": "My husband and I just loved this hotel.

With spacious, comfortable and well appointed rooms, this hotel is highly recommended. BIGGEST COMPLAINT: Poor recommendations from the front desk staff for dining, directions, etc. Dining recommendations were very pricey and touristy. Directions were often confusing and not what we asked for (ex. asked for vaparetto stop, given different boat service stop). ROOM: We stayed in a junior triple suite that was very spacious and comfortable. The room was exceptionally clean and nicely decorated. We had lots of windows to let the cool Venice air flow through. Housekeeping and turn down service were great. The bathroom was the most spacious we had in Italy, with a nice tub/shower combo. AREA: Safe, well lit area with lots of shopping and restaurants close by; although you will have to walk a bit to find the non-touristy restaurants, grocery stores, etc. It's a short walk to the Rialto bridge, St. Marks Square and other attractions. It's off of a pretty quiet side alley, so noise wasn't an issue for us. SERVICE: As mentioned, housekeeping and turn down service were nice, but we were dissapointed with the front desk staff. We didn't like their recommendations for dining, or their directions for getting around (we did better just using a map and time tables). FOOD: Complimentary breakfast bar was good, but not much variety from day to day. GETTING AROUND: Be prepared for lots of map reading, Venice is quite complicated to get around. Walking wasn't really a problem, but the vaperetto routes and stops are confusing at first. Signage is very poor and the employees were not so willing to help out. VENICE RECOMMENDATION: Two days is more than enough in Venice. We had a 4 night stay, and by day 3 we were sick and tired of all the crowds, overpriced food and lack of things to do (besides site seeing).

Downsides - we stayed in a standard room which was two single mattresses pushed together and there was no tea and coffee making facilities available. Cost of water taxis from the airport have gone up to 95euros so be prepared to haggle!

Here are my top observations: 1) If you arrive by train take the water taxi (6 euros each), stop at the Rialto Bridge (not the Rialto market) and walk away from the bridge in the opposite direction. You have to carry your bag(s) over that step bridge but once over you'll come to an alley, walk down and the hotel is two blocks away in a small courtyard. 2) Hotel is new, beautiful, clean, well appointed and very comfortable. 3) Hotel is very expensive (especially if your reserving two adjoining rooms) but hey..your in Venice! 4) The staff is outstanding in every regard. Great English, very friendly and they treat you with real coutesy.The referred outstanding restuarants and made the reservations, walked us to the water taxi. Took care of everything. First class in every respect. Great place for families. 5) European breakfast buffet included which is very handy for maximizing your day. 6) 7 minute walk to Saint Mark's square. Again, the location is perfect. Surround by shops and stores and Gondola's they whole deal. 7) Great bathrooms, showers with good water pressure, the whole works.

There was an ATM, pastry and small market (water, cola, etc) a few steps from the entrance. The hotel boasts of modern rooms and bath and they deliver with the added elegance of an old world feel. The bath had beautiful tile, gold mosaics, a tub with two shower options - handheld and rain head. The bath was deep and perfect for a soak after long days walking, Plenty of storage space, safe and mini fridge with reasonable prices for a hotel in Venice. The service at the front desk and breakfast area was above average. We booked a triple jr. suite for my mother, me and 11 year old niece. We had room 622 at the end of the corridor with two twins and a full size sleeper sofa which was very comfortable. The twin beds were comfortable however the pillows were very hard. The room had a desk and two chairs plus a long, narrow balcony overlooking a small quiet street. The balcony did not have a table or chairs which would have been a nice touch but we found ourselves looking over the ledge to the street below and rooftops. We paid $349 Euro per night plus tax inclusive of breakfast for three. We felt the rate was very reasonable for the space and amenities. Breakfast was ample with fresh pastries, yogurt, cheeses, meats, cereals, juices and an option for hot plates such as eggs, bacon and sausage (again, very reasonable costs). Coffee and hot cocoa was excellent and the service was fantastic. The staff treated my niece like a princess and applauded all of her efforts to speak Italian with the few phrases we taught her before leaving. We had very enjoyable meals at Aqua Pazzo and their sister spot a little further down on Piazza Santa Stephano which was a short stroll and felt so much more local than the other areas. We happened upon a music academy and could hear music from the windows and watched children at play on bikes and scooters as we enjoyed a light snack at a little cafe. We have stayed at much more expensive hotels in Venice....having stayed at La Commedia we have found a \"home\" in Venice. I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend this little gem to other travelers.....wonderful, wonderful stay. My only regret was not staying longer.

The hotel may say Four Star Deluxe, but the service is Five Star, with a tremendously gracious, classy, professional group of gentlemen behind the front desk. They speak excellent English, and are very helpful and nice. They even confirmed all of the dinner reservations I had made before we arrived from Tuscany. We stayed there with another couple, us in a junior suite, they in a deluxe double. Both rooms were quiet, very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The beds are firm (which we like) and the bathrooms are spotless (the shower is to die for). Be sure to have a cocktail at the rooftop bar or in the lobby, the bartender is a great guy.

Excellent value for money, well recommended. Recommend an evening drink upon the terrace bar on the top floor of the hotel. Although it lacked atmosphere as there were not many people using it at approximately 10pm we felt it was relaxing to have a night cap and take a look at the roof tops of Venice, which was an a different view to what you see when walking around during the day. Extremely minor recommendations would be to include bath robes and change the DVD on the film channel which was the same for the whole three nights we were there.

However, first of all arrived at the airport and thought blow the budget we will have a private water taxi what a great way to arrive in Venice absoulutly a must do and worth every cent of the 90 Euros you feel like a film star as you zoom under the Rialto bridge. Hotel is ideally placed for everything 2 minutes from the Rialto and about 5 from St Marks provided you dont get lost which of course you will do repeatadly, but this is all part of the charm of Venice. We stayed for 3 nights in the Hotel and it is fantastic the staff are brilliant and the terrace bar stunning, HOWEVER.............on our 2nd night the bar underneath room 114 was a little loud but nothing in comparison to the following night when returning to our room at 11.00pm it was like being in a nightclub......the walls were vibrating I kid you not!..........in addition there were around 50 people standing in the square singing and dancing and the bar also has some sort of car horn going as well....phoned reception and was told Hotel was full and so cannot move you it will stop around 2am!......tough.......phoned again at 1pm and 1.30pm and the hotel apparently told them to turn it down................3am it eventually finished!...............spoke to the manager the next day and blew my stack after no sleep, he assured me it was a rare event to go on so late and as a token wrote off our 90 Euro bar bill. However the Torino bar is directly under rooms 114, 115 and 113 and 213, 214 and 215 etc going up the hotel, if you are allocated any of these rooms refuse it unless you are going to the bar or an Insomniac..............for the 2 nights after we left the bar was advertising music till 2am so this is not a RARE event it is a regular event. Other than that Venice is as you expect it to be beautiful and timeless but so expensive..............Hotel will offer to book you a Gondola for 120 Euro you can get it for a around 75 if you haggle and restaurants there are 100s probably 1000s and we didnt have a bad meal. Coffee in St Marks Square is as you would expect a wallet clinching experience but one that has to be done so don't fight it, we went to Florins as its the oldest one in the square the waiter was miserable and 2 coffees and 6 biscuits was 35 Euros! St Marks Bassilica is stunning as is the Doge's Palace. There are lots of beautiful squares to have coffee and people watch, we also went to a Vivaldi concert in San Stefano Church which was amazing. We walked everywhere as the weather was great and its the best way to see this fantastic city. So enjoy the experience and don't worry about what its going to cost you have to do it all regardless of the cost and what's more they know it!", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkshire", "Title": "\u201cBreathtaking Venice and lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "CherylBerkshire", "ReviewID": "UR8756049", "Content": "We left for Venice on 10 Sept and I did have a few misgivings about my holiday that week from reports I had been reading - silly me! After a smooth flight from Gatwick we arrived at Venice Airport and were waved through by immigration and through the arrivals hall after collecting our one suitcase (travelling light pays off) and approached the Motorscafi desk just opposite on the right and booked a water taxi with a quote of 100e which included the bus to take us down to the dock. We decided to walk down with our case under a covered walkway and it was only 5 minutes - this was 90e. It's really so close so just walk down. We gave over our ticket and boarded our James Bond motor boat and were exploded from the dock - you have got to enter Venice this way; it was thrilling. As we approached Venice I got a bit misty eyed to see this sight after so many years of longing to - so different, so old and so lovely with the gondolas which were bigger than I had imagined and the gondoliers in their navy striped shirts and boaters - just magical. We docked at the Rialto Municipal stop and although I was worried that the hotel would be far away it was a mere 30 metres to the right then turn left and 20-30 metres at the Calle del Carbon and the hotel is there. The hotel is a 4 star and some have suggested it should be a five star but I think it's a really nice small 4 star. The reception was very friendly and helpful (not to mention good looking) and we were shown up by a bell boy to the second floor where our room faced the front of the hotel. The room was bigger than I imagined and all done in gold and cream with a huge queen bed and canopy above. The bathroom was reported as being huge - no it wasn't but was adequately fitted out with a great shower that had a head the size of a dinner plate and therefore, made you feel as if you were under a waterfall. The roof terrace on the 4th floor was absolutely lovely with new black cane furniture, a bar and barbecue all surrounded by geraniums and a view of San Marco's campinile in the foreground. Lovely place for an evening drink. Breakfast room was pretty and continental breakfast was adequate and hot stuff extra. Wish they did just plain croissants without apricot and chocolate inside - and some toast wouldn't go amiss either. Staff seemed slightly stretched and a bit forgetful at times although it was busy. Nice times from 0700-1030 lots of scope. We went out for a light lunch straightaway and started to wander up and down bridges, down alleyways with washing hanging overhead and people everywhere! It was crowded especially around the Rialto Bridge area which we always tried to avoid and had much more fun wandering the back streets and coming across new squares and churches and markets and a real taste of ordinary people's lives. The hotel had offered us a trip to Murano but when I said that this would only be a one way trip if we didn't buy anything he realsied that I was aware of this. We took a boat trip to Burano on the BURANO ferry itself and it was a lovely one hour trip to a very pretty multi coloured fishing village and famous for its lace which I must say isn't my thing but the peace and tranquility after Venice was welcome. We had a lovely lunch and in the small fish restaurant met a fellow Brit who had decided to actually live on Burano and loved it although he still worked somehow for the BBC - would be a bit quiet and cut off for me. We got used to the ACTV line and all the stops along the grand canal and decided to take the boat bus over to the Ferrovia train station and catch a train to Verona. The fare was 12e each and the ticket people quite helpful. So unusual to take a boat to the train station steps and get on a train going everywhere. There was a fast train, slow train, Eurostar and the Orient Express. The trains are efficient and clean and only delay was on the return journey which was unusual. Verona was lovely and like a smaller version of Florence. We went to see the 2,000 year old amphitheatre where the Verona Opera is held - last one on Sept 1st. This is second to the Coliseum in Rome and was a magnifent structure of ancient times. Went and had a nice lunch with the best white wine so far and strolled and sat for coffee and strolled some more. Suddenly turning my head left I spied the famous Romeo & Juliet balcony and we took a snap (it's only a myth you know). When you come out of Verona station you have to take the 11,12 or 13 number bus into the city centre. I have to admit we just jumped onto a bus with the crowds as we were'nt sure where to get tickets from. Verona was lovely and again a break from Venice. The food in Venice is mostly fish based which I love but my partner doesn't so we had to compromise although on the whole the food was great and only one bad experience (for me anyway) and it had to be a pizza! When my ordered anchovy and black olive pizza was brought to me I thought what's that, where's the anchovies? The base was rock hard and I only managed to eat the centre and that was hard work. When he came to collect the plates I felt like putting my ring of pizza over his head like a halo! One restaurant that was nice and peaceful and good service and food was Anonimo Veneziano, Calle del Fruttariiol nr. Campo San Marco Tel: 041/5289730. This was good old fashioned service and the food was good and reasonable 63e including wine and beer. San Marco square itself is magnificent but those pigeons I can do without-they shouldn't encourage them by feeding them - s and feathers everywhere - wait till the evening to go there much more romantic especially walking down to the sea and the entrance. I had had my eye on some Murano glass goblets which were in a little shop past the Hotel Bonvecchiati which was near the Commedia, They were a good price and the chap inside very helpful without the hustle. He displayed them for me and I chose 3 gorgeous colours (red not being a colour I like in anything), all edged in 22 carat filigree. He wrapped them up so carefully for the flight home and I was very happy with the purchase and the service. The Bonvecchiatti is a lovely 4 star hotel too larger than a la Commedia and quite plush and the dining terrace they have with piano playing looked really nice to have dinner there. We treated ourselves to dinner at a pricey restaurant on the third night and this is Do Forni on google for details I know. Part of it is designed liked the Orient Express but we choose the main dining room which was lovely and we were led to our table by the maitre de. The whole menu looked delicious and the flavours were wonderful. The service was immaculate and the head waiter was first class. However, things happen and the very nervy trainee waiter under the watchful eye of the head waiter picked up my bottle of wine from the ice bucket and proceeded to pour this into my partner's beer! Boy did he get it in the neck - from the far side of the room by the head waiter! Apart from this which was funny really and the drinks were replaced, the ambience and food etc were great - the bill came to 160e for a beautiful fillet mignon buttery peas and dauphonoise potatoes and a whole grilled sea bass with buttered asparagus with parmesan followed by an especially large piece of lemon merangue for my partner (to compensate for his beer having wine added to it) and my creme caramel which was sublime. This restaurant was worth it and well recommended especially by my work colleague - he was right. We roamed everywhere so ladies comy shoes and those pretty thonged sandals could be murder on the toes after a few hours, How to dress- well I'd say stick with pretty and cool - only jeans and trainers if the weather isn't too warm but even then I wouldn't wear them in Venice. The Italians are so stylish and the way they wear jeans and a white shirt and their shades and lovely shoes, will outdo anyone. Just be comfortable and take lots of rests for wine or coffee. Now the last thing I had to do was hunt down Campo San Barnaba as this was where the 1950's film Summer Time was filmed by David Lean with Katherine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi and I did find the little antique shop where they met etc and it was just the same inside almost but now a mask shop. Brilliant old film which captures Venice so well and my quest was complete. The lady in the shop had a dvd running of the film and made the most of its film connection although some Americans in the shop didn't have a clue about its background even though they were of the right age, The owner however remembered Rossano Brazzi well (Richard Gere of the 50's) and I don't think it was all for his acting!! I agree with her. Well, Venice surprised me and delighted me all at the same time and I hope one day to go back. I felt I didn't want to leave as we sped away in the motor boat (100e booked by the hotel with the bell boy taking your suitcase down to the waiting taxi for you). Pure class and as I sat in bed watching the latest James Bond movie with the closing scenes set in Venice and knowing that I was actually in the real set at that moment - well just fantastic. Any questions just fire away and please don't put off your trip anymore just book it and experience a world apart in just 2 hours.

We were shown to a beautiful room, number 114, overlooking Campo San Luca. However on returning to our room at 10:30pm we could not believe the level of noise in there. It was as though there was a live band playing in our room! Because we didn't know where it was coming from, when looking through the windows, which were tightly shut, we assumed that it was one of the locals with their stereo turned up very loud. The noise, which was impossible to block out even with ear plugs, eventually stopped at 3am. The next day we discovered that a bar called Torino @ Notte was directly underneath our room and the bar displayed a sign to show that they play live music at night until 2am. We asked at hotel reception if we could change rooms, but were told that the hotel was full and that \"that bar is usually a quiet bar\". We endured a further 2 nights of excruciatingly loud music and on returning home discovered that Torino @ Notte is one of the few places in Venice (La Serenissima?!) that is known for loud music. Well that is the bad bit. The good part is that the hotel room was beautiful, though we had no safe due to the room being so recently refurbished. Everywhere in the hotel was lovely and clean. The breakfasts were excellent and it was no trouble for the waiter to bring us a Macchiato, when asked, to go with them. Because we arrived relatively late in the evening on our first night, we asked for a recommendation from the hotel of somwhere to eat. I had read, on the internet, about a place called Bancogiro, but the receptionist said that he did not know it and advised us to go to Trattoria alla Scala, about 10 minutes away. When we eventually found alla Scala, the food was pleasant, though the scallops were a little gritty, and the few other diners there also seemed to be from A La Commedia. The next day we walked over to the Rialto market, which was less than 5 minutes from the hotel and there in Campo San Giacometto was Bancogiro and also another highly regarded restaurant Naranzaria. We ate at Bancogiro on the 2nd night. The food was of excellent quality and very good value. Staff were very friendly. Bancogiro's location is also great, because you can eat outside overlooking the Grand Canal! For those of you who have seen the latest Bond movie, Casino Royale, these 2 eateries are where the scene where diners get up from their seats in shock at the sight of the building opposite crumbling into the water were filmed. On our last night we ate at Osteria da Alberto in Cannaregio and can't recommend it enough - great food and, once again, very friendly staff. Try the Fragolino and Venetian biscuits. Also worth a visit is Al Bottegon, a little old fashioned bar near the little bridge in San Trovaso, opposite a Gondola workshop. They serve great cicchetti and drinks or coffee. There is standing room only, but it is a real Italian experience and we were grateful of it when we ran in out of the rain on our walk around the Accademia area. We would stay at A La Commedia again, but only if we could be guaranteed a peaceful bedroom.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cPerfection!\u201d", "Author": "Spicerd", "ReviewID": "UR7952831", "Content": "My family of five just completed a two night stay at Hotel a La Commedia and absolutely loved it!

As has been repeatedly mentioned, the location is great, with easy walking access to everything...no canal view, but the canal view we have had in the past (at the Bauer) is so straight down, it doesn't really lend itself to a relaxed looking out over the canal... so, we didn't miss the canal view at all...

The hotel is situated in a great location, about 1 minute walk from the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge, and about a 5 minutes walk from St Marks Square. Although you do not have a veiw of the canal, and the views are not spectacular, this does not disadvantage the hotel. It is situated amongst the designer shopping centre, close to the theatre and the concert halls, and restaurants. The hotel is very modern, exceptionally clean, and because it is quite small has an intimate feel about it. Our room was quite compact, and was in red and gold and felt very opulant. The bathroom is ultra modern, and cleaned twice a day. The chambermaids are very discreet and due to the electronic key system, they know when you are out of your room, so never disturb you. The bathroom was big, with overhead shower, and hand shower, marble decor will all modern fittings. The room had LCD T.V which has about 3 or 4 channels in English. Not that you have time to watch TV when you are in Venice! My only complaint about the hotel was the bed. The kingsize bed was actually two singles joined together, and the mattress was extremely hard as were the pillows, in fact it was like sleeping on concrete. We probably should have asked to change rooms and I am sure that would not have been a problem,as the staff were excellent. My baggage had gone missing and the airline did not deliver my case until my last day. The hotel staff went out of their way to help me, and contacted the airline veryday by phone and email to chase the missing baggage, all at no extra cost. They were helpful with everything you asked for help with, and always pleasant without being over the top. As they had been so helpful we did not pursue changing our rooms, which we probably should have. The breakfast room is delightful in red and gold, again giving the feeling of opulance, and the breakfast is buffet in style, with a range of cereals, fruit, croissants, rolls, ham, cheese etc. The waiting staff were very smartly dressed in uniforms, very attentive and helpful. Overall it is a good hotel, and I would recommend this to anyone visiting Venice for a short break. Have a look at their website before booking, as the pictures of the amenities are a true reflection of what the hotel is like.", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, excellent customer service\u201d", "Author": "2random", "ReviewID": "UR7704260", "Content": "This new hotel is well situated near to the Rialto Bridge and within easy walk of Venice's many attractions.

They even gave us a small gift for my birthday. The hotel does not have its own restaurant, but this is not really needed given its location.
