You do only get what you pay for. This is neither the Meridan or the Rotana, both of which are within a stone's throw from the Rose (and if you want a decent pub in which to drink, go across the road to Nelson's in the Rotana) But to business. This place is almost brand spanking new as I write this in March of 2012 and I have stayed there 3 times so far because my company office is across the road. It is in Tecom C which is not, by any stretch of the imagination, finished. So, anywhere you walk, including getting to the Rose on foot or sallying out of a night involves ploughing through acres of sand (and there is no shoe polisher anywhere in the hotel). The staff of the hotel are just downright substandard. For example, booking in, after I received my room key I asked if the room was a smoking room. Three times I received the answer yessir. However, there is not an ashtray to be found in the room and the record for getting a cheap glass ashtray delivered to my room is currently 4 hours. This is partly due to the fact that when i rang housekeeping I had to embark on a chain of 'phone calls, being deferred from one person to the next, each denying that the provision of an ashtray was within their scope of work. Ringing reception didn't help......................they never picked up the 'phone. As far as smoking is concerned, I really don't think they have a policy so non-smokers beware! There is some wierd dining rule in the Rock Bottom cafe involving payimg 100 dirhams for the privelege of gracing their premises and/or getting a rubber stamp on your hand. As far as I can gather, the rule come into force at 8 of an evening although I have yet to get a word of sense out of the Filipino receptionist. The alternative Sports bar is absolutely the place to be if you want to be ignored by a Filipino waitress. I have not yet been brave enough to try the Bollywood and Rocky's bars.The breakfast is just downright unpalatable and definitely does not cater for European tastes. But....................if you know the Ramee group, its origins and its business, all of this should be now surprise. As I said, the place is new so the rooms look good (although don't look under the bed which hasn't seen a vaccum cleaner since the place opened and in my last room, the bedside lamp was already hanging off by its wires). Quite what this place will be like once it has had a few years' wear and tear is anybody's guess but this traveller thinks that its one saving grace will also have disappeared. A place to stay if you want relatively cheap business accomodation, fine. For anything else, forget it.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Experience\u201d", "Author": "Sarosh D", "ReviewID": "UR122350833", "Content": "We were apprehensive about this hotel but in reality, it was a great place to stay.

In case you call the reception for any assistance,be prepared to call back again or else wait.A lady by the nam ecathy at the reception,very rude!The hotel has its own pubs,restaurants etc.We only had breakfast at the hotel.As there is a metro near by,you are well connected to dubai. The room that we were provided was spacious.The doors of the cupboard were broken,the dustbin lids were broken.Reast everything was perfect,comfortable bed and clean bathroom.Whiel checking out i did ask cathy for a feedback form...twice,i never received it!Also,the hotel has an option for 150 AED for an airport pick up & drop,do avail of that as if you were to take a one way taxi on your own,you will end up paying minimum 100 AED.

No complains about the room, was clean and good value for money. But here it comes the best part: an annoying piano music was being played on the corridor. After calling 3 times to the reception, I had to go down personally to ask for the music to be off. After check out (extremely rude FD agent, again) an e-mail arrives from Booking.com saying that I have not showed up to the room, so a cancellation fee will apply.

You would probably be better off munching on one of the hundreds of rats that hang around in the various noisy building sites surrounding the hotel. I don't think the hotel has been open long, and maybe it will improve, but why risk it, there are much better hotels in Dubai in much better areas that charge less.
