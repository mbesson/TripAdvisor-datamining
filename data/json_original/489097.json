I found it rather strange that the more nights you stay in this apartment the less service you get! In most hotels the more nights you booked they give you more service.I have to be fair about the comments re the cleaning services, when i booked direct to the Apartment they did say cleaning only on the 7th day after you check in,luckily I am quite a tidy person. I enquired on the 3rd dayif they would clean my room, and i was spoken to by a very rude (Chinese) girl, without a name badge, behind the reception saying in a very rude tone that I had not read the contract which I had signed which stated that the room would only be cleaned on the 7th day.! This girl should not be working in the front office with such bad PR. If I have known I would not have taken the studio as I could stay in the Grace hotel nearby for about the same price and with breakfast, and with room cleaning every day. Special mention must be given to the duty manager Henry who was very polite and knowlegable about Sydney. Do seek him out if you need any help. The corridors to your apartment are quite narrow and dingy. Sound proofing of the doors is quite bad as you can hear the sound quite clearly when someone open and close their doors.By the way the airconditioning has been programmed to switch off automaticaly after 4 hours, so in the middle of the night you will wake up sweating. So you have to get out of your bed to switch on the aircon again if you want to be cool . The whole place looks rather run down and tired ! Definately would not stay in this apartment again.

Unfortunately the standard of the deep cleaning ie Inbetween guests needs review as on closer inspection the oven hadn't seen a proper clean for some time and inside wardrobes needed cleaning. Apartments are showing signs of wear and tear and this is a shame. The biggest problem for us however was the street noise as we could hear cars until 3/4am ( on the 39th floor!) particularly weekend nights. If staying again in Sydney I wouldn't stay in CBD area again, better option is to stay elsewhere and use trains to get to harbour and shopping districts. Also a warning to those paying the reception for the shuttle bus to airport. We paid 14 dollars per person for one way and given voucher. Unfortunately unbeknown to us there are several shuttle buses providing the service. We travelled with 6 other guests to the airport and it wasn't until we arrived that the driver created a bit of a fuss because we had unintentionally travelled on the wrong shuttle! He obviously wasnt the shuttle service the reception staff had booked on our behalf but we hadn't realised this.

We have stayed in a 3 bedroom and 2 bedroom apartments at Pitt Street on different occasions and both are fine for families. Where Pitt Street really wins is location and size. Location - Pitt Street is right in the centre of Sydney. Its location meant we didn't get the car out of the car park once. Shopping, dining, parks and cinemas are all within 200 to 300 metres. Size - Pitt Street is quite small compared to say World Tower. This has benefits in less people at shared facilities like the pool and spa but most importantly less lift wait time. The ability to cook saves real money and with 2 supermarkets within an easy stroll accentuates this benefit. Staff were helpful and cleaning staff obliging. Yes the air conditioning is different with the 4 hour switch off but you get used to it - to be honest if the weather is good you can sleep with the windows open anyway! The only strange thing with the 2 bedroom apartment was the placement the both bathrooms next to each other even though one bedroom was at the other end of the apartment. Pitt Street would benefit from a bit of a paint in the common traffic areas in the apartment but it doesn't detract from the quality of the stay. To be honest a cold beer on the balcony looking towards the Sydney Harbour Bridge as the sun sets is pretty awesome!

There was even a decent sized dining table with comfy chairs. The bathroom was more than sufficient with a bath, and a laundry area concealed in a closet.

The wifi was decent in the lobby but we were only allowed limited free access.

There is also a Gym and swimming pool but I never got the chance to use it. There is a metro stop next door but I never used it. I walked everywhere. It is so accessible. When you come out of the hotel you turn left and follow the street and it brings you directly to Circular Quay, turn right and this will lead you to Darling Harbour. The city is so easy to get around. Circular Quay is a buzz of restaurants and bars and comes alive as the sun sets. It was an amazing feeling to be there and just soak up the atmosphere. Just to sit back have a drink and people watch. I did the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb. It was amazing, it is expensive but totally worth it. I had booked it in advance but you can just turn up on the day and book it. I took the ferry to Manly cost about $15 return, there is free wifi available onboard. Another great day out. I went surfing with Manly Surf School. I booked a lesson as I wanted to be within a group. It was $60 and good value. I learnt so much and the instructor was excellent. I took the bus to Bondi.

You can get some concessions and also there are group tickets you can get for various attractions which will save a few dollars.

Centrally located at the junction of Pitt Street and Bathurst Street, it's 15 minutes on foot to all-time kids' favourites like Sydney Aquarium and Wild Life Sydney at Darling Harbour. To buy groceries, a major Woolworths outlet at George Street is just 5 minutes walk away. Transportation wise, Town Hall train station is less than 3 minutes walk away, which gets you to major attractions like the Rocks, Harbour Bridge and Opera House in just 2 train stops (alight at Circular Quay). Empty taxis whizz pass Meriton every few seconds (maybe that's because taxi is an expensive mode of transportation). For shopping, getting to the factory outlets at Birkenhead Point is a breeze - you can buy a Prepay ticket at the 7-Eleven located just outside Meriton and take Metrobus M50 from Park Street (near the junction with Castlereagh Street). M50 takes you to Bondi Beach as well if you travel in the opposite direction. If you wish to get to the airport, you can pre-book an airport shuttle bus from the reception before your departure date for just AUD$14 per adult. And yes, I forgot to add, the receptionists I encountered were also friendly and most helpful. In terms of accommodation, we took a one-bedroom apartment at Level 18 (note: the ground floor lobby is Level 11). The apartment is well-kept and well-equipped. The kitchenette has all the amenities that allows you to do basic cooking - a stove, sink, oven, microwave, dish washer and all the utensils. Dishwashing liquid is also provided. For laundry, both a spin dryer and washing machine is provided within a small ensuite laundry room (to keep out the noise). Again, laundry detergent is provided. Other than the occassional sirens from the streets we hear at night, the bedroom is quiet and comfortable. This is testified by my one-year old baby who slept through the night, every night, without stirring, for 4 consecutive nights. Attached to the bedroom is a balcony which we did not make use of. Internet service (wired and wireless) is also available within the room at a rate of AUD$18 for 24 hours. The only downside is probably the absence of any view out to the city (despite a large balcony at the bedroom) since we were staying at a low floor and surrounding us were all buildings.

The check in procedure was seamless and within minutes of verifying my details, we were in our two-bedroom apartment and for the (sale) price I paid, this was excellent! Usually the pricing of these apartments are $600+ and even I was amazed at the price I got this for. The apartments were clean with the furniture modern and almost brand new; it was the comforts of simple living. We had great views of the city and our Balcony had a great backdrop of the sunset behind the Sydney Tower. We had a great night out with a couple of our friends who had joined us. We were playing music, watching TV and playing board games whilst having a great laugh. It felt as if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lived there as usually the next door neighbours would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve started to complain that we made a lot of noise.

Yes, there was road noise if the doors were open, but this is inevitable for a central city location and not overwhelming.

(weekends a few hundred more) I wanted to give this place a glowing review because I know they did try hard to make the penthouse an unforgettable place to stay, but it was just lacking that \"something\" First impressions were not too good. Called up to make a booking and was the staff sounded as though they did not want to work there. Upon arrival however, the girl at the front was friendly. Bear in mind that this is not a hotel, so I did not expect exceptional service. Expect to take all your bags up yourself with the trolleys provided and the lobby is very small so it was hard for me to manoeuvre the damn thing. The staff saw me having trouble but don't expect staff to offer to help! There are only 2 lifts for all the apartments and there is even a sign to tell you that there are usually long delays. So we waited and waited for the lifts to arrive and at last I clumsily dragged our bags up to the penthouse on level 51. The penthouse at Pitt St was extremely large - 3 bedrooms with 3 bathrooms. The living area was very spacious but the bedrooms were surprisingly small. It did however, fit 3 couples well. The kitchen was well equipped and there was also a laundry. The apartment had all the things we needed but it was nothing special as the furnishings were like the other rooms at the Meriton (we've had relatives stay at the 1 bedrooms before) and nothing was overly \"luxurious\" about the place. 4 stay, maybe but not 5 star. I think I expected too much because it was a penthouse suite. I could not sleep well either because my room was next to the air con exhaust vent. Location was excellent though - Woolworths only 3 minute walk away and most of Sydney's CBD attractions within walking distance. There is no free parking in the complex.

They also arranged for a shuttle bus to the airport which picked us up out the front and was only $14 each, so practically the same as the train fare but much more convenient. I highly recommend this property and hope to stay there again. I have no idea what the previous reviewer is talking about and find it hard to believe that any of the Meriton's rooms are run-down.

It's actually on a side street and this isn't clearly shown. Also, you can't really park out the front and drop your bags off (or if someone is dropping you off) 3) Rooms are average at best. The beds are comfortable, but not anything to write home about. They are also all very dark, and look straight into office buildings over the road. I don't THINK that any of them have proper balconies, but I could be wrong on that. 4) No room service to speak of. You can order from some local restaurants (which are very good) but it's pretty limited hours and a couple of the restaurants in the hotel guide no longer service the building. You also can't charge back to your room, so you need to pay each time. The location is very handy (particularly to my office), but there's definitely better apartments and hotels in Sydney.

Tons of bars and late-night places open which might be great if you're younger and looking for that sort of thing, but which wasn't really a comfortable fit for a business traveler. The elevators as others have mentioned, were a horror show. I think I waited 20 minutes or so at some points for a lift. Checking in was also pretty annoying. I had just flown in on a 9 hour flight and was absolutely exhausted on check-in. I received no help with my baggage and was pointed to a trolley I could use myself if I wanted to haul my luggage to my room. How helpful. I had to wrestle the trolley with my bags through all of the young party-goers hogging the lift to go out at night. All in all, it took me probably 45 minutes to just get into the room. On my own. In the middle of the stay, the dishwasher broke down and spewed water all over the carpets which was disgusting. The housekeeping was a bit hit or miss. At first they were coming daily. Later it seemed they just came once a week. I called to check on it and they said it was supposed to have been 2x a week. Also? The oven in the apartment was INCREDIBLY confusing to use and there were no instructions on it in the apartment manual. And, the rates for using the wifi were outrageous.

The apartment is roomy, clean and well appointed. It's nicely located near Queen Victoria Building and Hyde Park with plenty of shops, grocery store and cafes nearby. Kitchen and bathrooms were updated and modern. We splurged for the \"sky view\" (I think that is what they call it) which guarantees a high level floor with a view and balcony. The major downside of staying here is their policy of locking the doors to the balcony on Friday and Saturday nights. This was a big disappointment for us since our 4 nights stay included both Friday and Saturday. Apparently they have had problems with \"partiers\" throwing objects off the balcony. Which I can understand being a problem but not sure why everyone needs to be punished for the behavior of others. There has got to be another way to handle, especially when renting to a bunch of calm 45 + year olds from the states that are in bed by 11 ;-) The only other slight negative is that we found ourselves always heading up to the rocks/opera house area of Sydney which was quite a hike especially after a long day. The free #555 bus that runs up and down Elizabeth Street from circular quay was helpful but it didn't run past 5ish. Finding decent accommodations similar to the Meriton in that location was not easy for the price point we wanted to pay. Another tip for travelers with luggage, don't take the air train, although it's fast and convenient there are no lifts and LOTS of stairs to get up to the ground level from the train stop.

Also the hotel policy of the Air conditioner switching off after 4 hours was in operation. Sydney was cold on the nights we were there. Only thin duvets were on the bed, and no extra bedding was in the apartment. We in fact put on clothes to keep warm. Before the 2nd night, we requested that the blankets and extra bedding provided. These were duly delivered and the room service attempted to reset the control for the air conditioner. The extra blankets and duvet were appreciated on the 2nd night. The maintenance personal checked out the air conditioner of the 3rd day, but on returning at 8pm, found that he had left a note to say it was faulty and needed a new part. On phoning reception to ask what it meant, their initial reply was the room was warm when he had gone up there. We requested a further blanket and explained that this was not a cheap backpackers place to stay. After an hour, he phoned back and said he would refund approximately a third of the cost. Have yet to see this credit, but it was a form of recompense that was not asked for. The 3rd and last night was just as cold--thank goodness for the extra blankets. The central heating system is switched off after 4 hours to \"save the environment' Obviously if the system had worked in the first place it may have.

This place is ideal for those with more than three kids who need three bedrooms at a reasonable price. This is keenly priced but is not low rent in its upkeep. It has everything a family trip would need. The washer and dryer are great so yu can leave with no huge bag of dirty laundry. The beds a little hard but not the end of the world. The view from the 44th floor is great but even up there Sydney has one noisy group of cops who seem intent on playing with their sirens all though the night which is strange as Sydney is not a problem place for crime on anyones map. The locals when you find them away from the Chinatown area and tourists are very typical capital city types (yes we all know the capital is technically canberra but who goes there!). Mostly young, high disposable income want to show off in restaurants etc. Lots of those at the beaches even in the dead of winter. There is a serious issue with drink driving in Australia so if you hire a car and drive outside the city take care. The police can and do stop anyone for no reason to breathalyze them with good cause. Australians are also very aggressive when in a car. They will drive you off the road if they think you are too slow yet their road manners with respect to speed limits couldn't be better. Again the police and due to the low crime rate they are retentive about traffic offences and totally stupid about parking. Don't try talking to rangers. Firstly they will likely be immigrants and speak fractured English, second they don't ask for nor respect apologies so don't waste your breath, save it for the breathalyzer, you will get one of those too. The hotel has good underground parking but it is very expensive at 35 AUD day. On balance its worth it of you need to travel out of Sydney. Be very careful with the TAG system for the freeways. They levy HUGE fines if you don't phone in to pay within 48 hours. Again no flexibility and stupidly no way to pay by cash. Totally stupid system and very typucaly Australian like the cross city tunnel that cost a fortune and no one needed It's a North South city dummy!! Places to go well you ca walk to most from Pitt Street. It is a gorgeous city if a little over the top with its own wonderfullness. Don't bother looking for news as you won't find any. If you like a laugh look a the TV ... it's hilarious for five minutes. No wonder everyone lives outside and pays a fortune to see the harbour. Central Sydney can be seen on foot in a day and you can finish it off by taking a ferry to Manley for dinner and back. Avoidthe observation tower, a total waste of cash as is the comedy monorail but strolling around you can see darllng harbour bridge; wildlife sanctuary and opera houes; botanical gardens in one walk. Do NOT use the city convenience stores which appear to be a huge rip off but this block is right next to Woolworths (not the UK/US place but a simple supermarket shop with food etc). Its a great city and this is a great place to stay. One caveat, he gym is atrocious (no air con and I can't imagine what it smells like in summer) and the pool is tiny.

There are some excellent reviews on here based on larger appartments which are higher up in the building which I'm sure may have been a lot nicer. Right now to our experience. We were here on our honeymoon, and for our first Xmas and new year in Sydney. The reviews on here were very good so we based our booking on this, but the hotel fell short in so many ways. Apparently 1 bed appartments are not any higher than the 34th floor, so forget about all the amazing views people have commented on, please do not expect any of this in a 1 bed appoartment. On arrival we were given a 1 bed appartment on the 34th floor. What a treat we had in store, when on turning on the tv, we found a lovely porn dvd playing in the dvd player from our last guests, oh how generous of the hotel. Our room was also overlooking a big vent, which you could here at all times, but the noise magnified if you ventured out onto the balcony. Our room was also quite clearly a disabled room, with handrails on the toilet and the sink being below my waist. There was also no bath (but apparently this is not something they guarantee on booking your rooms). The rooms were also not cleaned well at all, each time our towels were changed they were replaced with dirty towels with lovely stains on. We returned from the beach one day early on in the stay so were a little sandy, and this sand remained on the floor for a further 4 days! We complained to the staff, who were not interested in the slightest, telling us this was not a disabled room and not even offering us any explanation or apology for the porn dvd (perhaps it was one of their own?). The manager on duty handled the situation very poorly, not offering any apology but sticking to the hotel line (some customer service training here would have been useful for all the staff at the hotel we encountered, except the last manager on the last day who did apologise profusely). They did offer to move us, showing us two of the smallest 1 bed appartments (without balconies) they could find on the lowest floors, and said they would try to move us as soon as possible later in the stay (of course we never heard from them again!). One positive is the location, as everything is within easy walking distance from the hotel, and Town Hall station just 2 minutes away. But there are lots of apparthotels on Pitt Street, which have exactly the same location, so this should really be a given. With the poorest service anywhere on our month trip of NZ and Oz, I would not reccommend these appartments to anyone staying in Sydney.

Get the bus or a taxi to Bondi and do the walk from Bondi to Coogie Beach. Start at the back of the icebergs to the right of Bondi as you look at the sea.

He also did not even bother to drop us near our airline at the terminal and told us to just walk the rest of the way instead even though it was at the other end of the terminal and he was going to drive by it anyway. Once we tried to check-in for our flight, they told us that it had been cancelled and they had booked us on an earlier flight.

However, anyone with kids,, luggage or any sort of physical limitation will find the lifts infuriating. Minutes, as in up to 10 minutes, waiting for the lifts was a common complaint heard from other guests. Gripe number two will sound picky and probably unwarranted; however, one reason we stay in an apartment is that we feel like we're living there (albeit short term). We have never stayed in an apartment where the rooms were cleaned every day. We eventually told housekeeping to wait until our stay was over. The room did seem to let in a lot onot so much from outside noise - it is the CBD so there is noise from traffic but it did not enough to keep us up at night.

The apartments are huge and perfect for a family, the views were to die for. We were on the 42nd floor (really the 31st as the ground floor is the 11th - go figure) and had views of Hyde Park, Darling harbour, Harbour Bridge, the city, Sky Tower and more. The furnishings are basic but very nice and the place was spotless with fresh towels and little toiletries brought in daily as well as rubbish emptied daily and basic tidying done. Other than that you have to do your own cleaning but that's fine and to be expected with an apartment. The dvd player was a huge plus with little ones and we rented dvds from the Woolworths around the corner which was also handy as toddlers don't really do well at restaurants so easy access to a proper grocery store (rather than a 7 11) was great. The major complaint was the lift which took forever. It was honestly silly and got to where we would factor in an extra 5 minutes or more just for \"lift time\". Another complaint is the street noise. Despite being so high up you are right in the middle of Australia's largest and busiest city and so there is a lot going on and you can hear it all through the night. The apartments themselves are quiet and your neighbours are quiet but there is traffic all through the night. It didn't disturb the kids at all but I'm a light sleeper so didn't do well. Nevertheless, it's to be expected in a big city and the location is fantastic, we could walk anywhere even with the little ones. It was literally 5-15 minutes to all attractions so didn't have to do taxis or trains at all (although we still took the Monorail for fun). there is a pool and fitness centre but we didn't use or even look at either. There isn't a restaurant but honestly, you're in the middle of several hundred so just walk out the front door and take your pick. Alternatively, several local restaurants will deliver to the apartments and there is a menu folder in each apartment so you can order take away.

The location is fantastic for exploring Sydney. Its a 5-10 minute walk to Darling Harbour, for those that aren't up to the walk or when it rains you're a couple of minutes from a monorail stop that will take to there (although its quite expensive). Circular Quay is a bit further but still very walkable. Pitt Street runs parallel to George Street which is the main shopping area. The Queen Victoria Building is just around the corner and is bursting with fabulous shops for all price ranges and is worth a visit itself . QVB has lots of beatiful original features such as enormous stanied glass windows and as its not like any other shopping arcade i've ever been to, truely spectacular. Within a 5 minute walk there are bus stops for all of the beaches as well. The reception staff will point you in the right direction. Our apartment was clean, roomy and comfortable. There were however four small things that bugged me - 1. We had paid for a 1 bed apartment with kitchen so we could cook some evnings. The room came without a cooker and just a microwave which meant no cooking. Not a massive issue as we ate out instead but they should probably make that clear when booking. 2. The room we rented shared a main front door with the apartment opposite (you do have your own front door as well). This would normally mean great sound proofing but not so here. The person in the opposite room had a habit of coming and going at 6am which meant everytime they shut and opened both doors we were woken. Again, not a massive issue but a little annoying if you are on holiday for a bit of relaxatoin. 3. Our room was on the 19th floor which is actually only around 8/9 floors up. The only issue with this is if you get one of the lower floors they are very dark as all the surrounding buildings are very tall. Our room had a balcony but there were no views at all just more very tall buildings. I guess this is quite often the issue if you're staying in a city. 4. The lifts in this building are a nightmare. They seem very concerned for security for some reason. You flash a fob in front of the keypad in the lifts and they will only take you to your floor. Sounds ok but this means that the lifts won't stop once they've set off. So when they pick people up from the basement, they go past the lobby (where you're waiting) and won't stop until they've dropped the basement people at their floor, it could be 20+ floors up. Then if someone on that floor gets in and goes to the basement, they again won't stop when they go past. So in a really tall building you sometimes have to wait 10 minutes to get a lift. Although I've rated on about these 4 points the apartments were a great base, very comfortable and I would definitely stay there again. As we'd not intended to stay here I'm sure we didn't get the most competitive rate but even so, it was around the same price as a decent hotel and you get lots more room and of course can wash your dirty socks & pants rather than having to pay for them to be cleaned elsewhere.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood location but not impressed with the room\u201d", "Author": "pride", "ReviewID": "UR27782278", "Content": "It has been 4 mths since we came back from our stay at the Meriton (29 Dec-03 Jan 09).

There was everything you needed for a cuppa when we arrived, although the coffee wasn't very nice so if you have a favourite brand maybe you should pick up a jar on your way through pitt or george st as there are plenty of shops that are open all night. I think the tea was twinnings!! This apartment block had a sauna, swimming pool and gym and they all looked modern and very clean. I can't comment anymore on these as i didn't actually use them as i was too busy exploring the city.. The balcony had really comfy chairs and the view of Sydney light up at night was amazing.. From here we had full view of the Sydney Tower, which is worth a trip up as the views are fantastic!! This is an ideal place to stay as it is really near the train station (called town hall station i think) and from there you can jump on a train for a short trip to get to the harbour bridge and opera house!! There is also so many different places to get food from and the choice is unbelievable!! Pizza hut is not far and for about $14 you can eat what you like, including dessert! and they do a mean chocolate cake :-) The apartment was equipped with a combi washer/dryer which i could get to work so i had to rely on my butty to work it, ( and as he is a man it was a little embarressing..lol) i had an amazing stay here and would recommend to anyone!!", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, pity about the noise.\u201d", "Author": "naasboy", "ReviewID": "UR23208896", "Content": "Stayed at the Meriton serviced apartments on Pitt St, Sydney, for 5 nights in December 08.

The location is great - we walked to Darling Harbour and the Rocks, but the monorail line is close by so you can always catch that. The Town hall stop is very close too, so you can catch the airport train - we didn't do that as we had too many people to make it worth while - taxi cost about $50+ from the airport. The following review only applies to the apartment we stayed in - I don't know about any others: The view we had was great - glimpse of the Harbour Bridge, Anzac (?)bridge, AMP tower, Kings Cross Coca-cola sign, Hyde park. Lots of places within walking distance for breakfast. And close to main street for catching taxis. The master bedroom is spacious with an ensuite. The two other bedrooms are a good size but we did have to move some furniture out so we could get into one of the wardrobes - all rooms have their own big wardrobes (masterbedroom has a walk-in robe). There are two bathrooms, three bedrooms, lounge and dining area, kitchen, a little office, a laundry, one large balcony and a smaller balcony for one of the bedrooms. The place was clean. The beds were made daily and toiletries replaced. There were enough towels, but they weren't replaced daily so when we took them to the pool we would wash them in the apartment laundry ourselves. As with most hotels, in my experience, there was never enough toiletpaper, but we just bought our own from the Woolworths nearby - stayed open until midnight every night we were there. The facilities include a pool, spa, sauna, gym - 2 treadmills, 1 cross trainer, 2 bikes, weight station machine and some mats - cannot remember anything else - tv and water fountain in there too. The carpark for hotel guests is right at the bottom and you need to drive down a tight spiralling road to get there, so be prepared to get dizzy. The elevator does take forever as it skips levels even though they are on the way. If you are waiting in the lobby to go up, it can be quicker to catch an elevator going down. I tested it - I went down to the car park, then beat my family going up to level 41 as the elevator didn't stop at level 11 (lobby) on the way back up. One odd thing - the apartment could sleep 6, but there weren't enough coffee cups or glasses for everyone - guess previous guests broke some and they were never replaced. The kitchen had most things that you needed (no frying pan though) - microwave, fridge, stove, cooktop, dishwasher, toaster, kettle, and even a garbage disposal unit. There was tea, coffee and sugar.

They did surprise us on Sunday when they came in at 9am. We said no thanks to the service that early in the morning. The lifts is my biggest annoying issue with the place. They only have 3 lifts and it can take a while to get up or down during peak times (morning and evening). One of them seems to be constantly occupied by house keeping and the other two fuzzy logic. A few times the lift bypass our floor on the way down and we had to wait for another. A couple of times we stopped at least 7 times which is annoying.

If you buy weekly rail passes (which entitle you to use the ferries and buses but not the light rail or monorail), take advantage of the buses which goes up and down Gearge Street.

Great location, great staff and great rooms. The location is central Sydney and you can easily walk to Darling Harbor or to Circular Quay. The monorail is right next to the hotel as well and an all day pass is good value at $10. There are a host of coffee outlets, caf\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, restaurants and bars and importantly as this is an apartment with cooking facilities, supermarkets. The front desk staff are wonderful and helpful. Full of knowledge of their city and what they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to know they attempt to find our or find for you. The room staff were all exceptionally pleasant and would do small requests straight way (we broke a glass and needed help with the bits and replacement and we needed a room service menu). The main point is how they all seemed happy and that is to me a biggie. There is nothing quite so bad as arriving at the front desk or being greeted by room staff with a morose out look on life it can make a real downer to your day. We used the room service menu a couple of times this is provided by some local restaurants and they were quick, courteous and the food arrived hot. The rooms are big comfortable and well laid out. Might not be as luxurious as the Hilton or Westin but are easy to live in. When I say not as luxurious this is not a slight on the apartments, everything is in good maintenance, clean, functional and very comfortable. There is room to spread your self out and relax. A good size lounge, dinning and kitchen separate bedroom and separate bathroom. The kitchen has all the normal facilities of oven, microwave, dishwasher, cook top and the pots, pans plates, glasses etc you would expect. A decent sized fridge and freezer not one of the little tiny bar fridges. You can get more than two cans of drink into this one. A washing machine and drier are provided per apartment and while doing the washing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t high on the agenda when on holiday it means a smaller case while traveling. My children are all grown up but I can remember the days of being in hotel rooms with small children who want to get toys or colouring pens out to play. There was never enough room. The Meriton has that space. The lifts which others have complained about and other residents of the apartments were complaining about are a bit of a nuisance. Best approach is don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave it till the last moment if you have to be down on the street at an exact time. Just stroll out and nonchalantly wait the lift will eventually arrive. It gets a bit disconcerting to watch the lifts go up and then go straight past your floor on the way to the lobby. Apparently the lifts are weight rated and when they reach a certain capacity don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop at any more floors. Having been told that I appreciated the wait for a lift. How many times have you been on a lift which is full, it stops at another floor and another family believes they can just squeeze in or load several large cases in.

Maid service was provided daily. The bed was very comf and the unit had a good sized desk - my only complaint about the desk - and this goes for all hotels please listen! - is the lack of plug space. The available receptacle was under the desk and required me to unplug something else if I wanted to plug in more than one item. These days we all have a laptop and a cell charger so why not make it easy by at least providing a power bar instead of having us rummage around under the furniture looking for power? I ended up using the outlet on the stove. Back to the Meriton Pitt - although I was in the CBD and next to the monorail my room was quiet - very quiet. Even the revellers in the streets for Mardi Gras seemed muted. The location is great for business - I attended many meetings and visited many clients and all but one were within a 5 minute walk. Circular Key is maybe a 10 minute walk. There are several places to eat and drink but the higher end restaurants are further down Pitt toward the water.

We wanted something 4-5 star, in the heart of the CBD and with a proper kitchen and separate living/bedroom areas. We had seen a heap of glowing reviews on the Meriton Rialto (Pitt St), and so felt fairly confident in finally making the booking. Ok, so we arrived and it IS in a really good location. For some reason not even known to myself, I've always preferred the southern end of the CBD (Circular Quay, Wynyard, anywhere south of the Pitt St Mall basically) and so this wasn't QUITE there, and some of the areas around were a little dodgy at night, but there was a Coles and also a Woolworths on 2 corners right nearby, George St where all the buses go from is around the corner...and Pitt St Mall is only like, 2-3 blocks away. It's also quite a lovely 15 minute (but doesn't seem that long) walk to Circular Quay and The Rocks and stuff...so yeah, it really IS a great location. Another good thing is the noise level. Despite being in the middle of probably the busiest city in the country, we really couldn't hear anything much in the day or night...hardly any real traffic noise...obviously if a siren goes off or a really loud truck or something goes by, you'll hear it but otherwise, nothing. There was some sort of protest right outside Town Hall the other day and we heard absolutely nothing! Now, check in went smoothly. We arrived at a very busy time it seemed, as there were a million people stuffed into the foyer, but then luckily most of them were lost and actually wanting one of the other Meritons (very close proximity, the other 2 properties) so they left. When we first went up in the lift to our room on the 25th floor (but not really, as the ground floor is actually the 11th floor for some reason...so we were more like the 14th floor I think), we had no idea the issues and dramas we would have in future with the lifts...I know people have mentioned them in previous reviews, but I never expected what happened... Anyway, so the room was nice, but a fair bit smaller than expected...just based on the website photos and other similar hotels/apartments I'd stayed in (like the Sebel, Quay West, Medina, Quest, etc), and the windows weren't the floor to ceiling ones I'm used to, but small narrow/thin ones...the bedroom was very small (like, when the door wasn't completely open or closed, you couldn't get in the room unless you climbed over the bed) and the cupboard wasn't mirrored, which wasn't a problem except that the only longish mirror was on the wall that when the door was open, you couldn't see, so whenever I got dressed or did my make up or hair or whatever, I had to have the door at least partially closed. This is a minor thing and I wouldn't even mention it except for the other things... The balcony mentioned on the website...well, basically it was non-existent. You could open the door, yes, but we found it quite funny actually, when reading the Meriton information/rules, where it said that if you were going to smoke, you had to do it on the balcony with the door closed behind you. This was amusing because you simply could not do this without plummeting the 14 or so floors to your probable death on the street below. There was no room for even a very thin, small child to fit on this balcony with the door closed. I am a small woman and I had to stand with one leg on the balcony and one leg, and half of my body, in the apartment. So...yeah. I noticed the floors way above had proper balconies though...I guess we just weren't lucky enough to get one of those rooms. The shower door wouldn't shut...the toilet roll holder was bent downward and so the roll, when a full roll, kept sliding off to the floor...and the cleaning staff who made our bed and brought more towels, etc, though lovely, always came at 5pm...which is sort of annoying because it's often a time when you've either just come home from a busy day and you're exhausted and just want to relax, or you're trying to get ready to go out...and sometimes both. We found it annoying that we'd come home sometimes to find people in our room and we'd have to wait around before we could do anything... The air conditioning was so loud we couldn't have it on. It wasn't so much the air itself that caused the noise, but the force of the air, even on a low setting, was so violent that it caused the vents to rattle incredibly loudly and we ended up just sort of being a bit hot and stuffy alternating with a bit cold (the a/c apparently was always on, but just not the fan part which was the loud bit.) On the first night, I noticed 2 mosquitos buzzing around so we killed them. (We had not had the balcony door or window opened at this point. We actually assumed they'd been locked by hotel management, as I was told prior to arriving that they locked the doors on Friday & Saturday nights...we later found this was not actually the case). Later that night, it was about midnight, I was lying in bed kind of daydreaming and noticed an increasing number of small dots on the ceiling above...I sort of wondered what they were, but didn't think much of them as I was tired and sort of assumed they were those little tiny bug flies...they aren't any sort of bother, so it didn't matter to me, and I turned off the light. However, soon enough, after the lights were off, I heard multiple buzzings in my ear, and turned on the lights to see all these mosquitos floating around the room. I freaked out, as I HATE mosquitos and bugs in general. I went to the bathroom, thinking I'd be safe there, but no. Another 2 were in there. The lounge also was home to several mosquitos. I couldn't sleep like that and I was worried they were breeding in the air conditioning or something, so I ended up going downstairs to reception at 1.30am to find out what could be done. I half expected they would let us move rooms, which I wanted (also to get a room with a proper baclony), but they gave me a can of fly spray, which did the trick anyway and thankfully no more mosquitos appeared for the whole week. I don't know how they got in though in the first place. Ok, so the last thing is the lifts...ohhhh, the lifts. The night I had to go down at 1.30am to get the fly spray, I waited...15 minutes for the lift to go down. The next day I was meeting friends who were going to phone me when they were outside for me to come down to bring them up to store their bags in our room for a few hours...they ended up coming up by themselves as I just simply could not get down! I waited over 20 minutes while the 2 working lifts (normally there are 3) just kept going past my floor every single time... Every day, whenever we went out, we would waste over 15 minutes...this added up to about 30-45 minutes each and every day of the week we were there, just hanging around waiting for the lifts!! It was ok going up from reception. They were slow, but just normally slow, not ridiculously slow. It's not just that they're slow, to clarify on others' reviews. I assumed from those that they were just slow because of the number of guests and maybe the lifts themselves were old or something, but noo...they are actually fast lifts. What causes the incredible slowness is the way they are progammed. Most lifts go down from a floor, picking up people who have pressed the button at their floor on the way...but these lifts don't do that. If a lift is 2 floors above you, it'll go right past your floor on its way to the very floor you're trying to get to. Then it'll go up again, also ignoring you, before coming back down again, not stopping at your floor a second time. It is INCREDIBLY frustrating. Anyway, that's it. We did have a wondeful time and overall the Meriton IS a good place to stay. These issues (except for the lift) weren't a big deal, but I wanted to mention them as everyone else seems to think it's this absolutely amazing, perfect place, and in my experience (which may have been bad luck or unusual for the hotel), it just isn't.", "Date": "February 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Perfect!\u201d", "Author": "shan31667", "ReviewID": "UR6811794", "Content": "My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights over Chinese New Year weekend and couldn't pick many faults with the place.

Our stay did not get off to a good start when we arrived around 7.30pm on a Friday night and were given a fairly small apartment on level 23 (ground floor is level 11), on the corner of Bathurst and Pitt Streets. This corner suffers from the obvious traffic noise in a big city, together with the frequent whooshing and clanking of the Monorail which passes below. There is NO double glazing. Along with the noise which kept us awake, we were also sleeping on extremely hard beds! However, as we had prepaid for 8 nights and had, in fact, requested a quiet apartment, we felt that some consideration should be given to our comfort for the remaining 7 nights and the next morning we asked to be moved. There was some initial reluctance, but we were eventually moved to the 35th level, on the side of the building. This apartment was HEAVEN compared to the previous one : only a distant murmur of traffic could be heard. Additionally, the beds were very comfortable in this apartment. The soundproofing between apartments is excellent. We could hear people getting in and out of lifts, but once their apartment doors were closed, not a sound could be heard which was wonderful. This one bedroom apartment was clean with a good sized lounge and good kitchen facilities. Lacking was the provision of bowls for soup/pasta etc. The bathroom basin didn't have a plug and we asked for one, which never materialised. Housekeeping was erratic. Some days dishwashing liquid/powder was left, other days it wasn't, but all in all a reasonable job was done. Rubbish was always removed. As previous reviewers have said, the location is superb - so close to everything. I would stay at Meriton again. I feel that management should ensure that people who have prepaid for a number of nights be allocated the quieter and more comfortable apartments.

The member of staff dealing with our booking informed us that our room was still occupied and would not be ready until 2 pm. She then did everything she could to find us an alternative apartment, which she duly did, and we got into our room before 8 am, very helpful staff through out our stay. The questions highlighted by other reviewers on the length of time it could take to get a lift. We have to say we found them ok never had to wait more than 1 to 2 minutes. The only exception to this was when we booked out, our friends had to wait about 9 minutes. They have an excellent security system in that you can only enter the apartments at night by using your room key, which has a security tab on it, which you use to gain access to the apartments lobby, you also have to use the same fob to gain access to your floor when using the lift (added security). The apartments are of a very high standard well equipped and tastefully decorated, the bedrooms were both of a high standard king size beds in both rooms, rooms with double beds in both rooms are very hard to find in Sydney and Australia in general (well it was for us) the master bed room had on suite facilities, and the other bedroom had a separate bathroom / shower room with easy access off the main room. The kitchen facilities were of good quality, which we used for our breakfast daily. The apartments laundry facilities included a washer and tumble dryer and also a dishwasher. The view from our window / balcony was over the city could have been better, but having said that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Sydney to sit our apartment. Would not hesitate in using these apartments again or recommend these apartments to anyone who is looking for an apartment rather than a hotel whilst in Sydney. The location gave us easy access to all parts of Sydney, which we wanted to visit, all locations are within walk distance or short taxi rides, which are reasonable, priced. One tip it can take a long time during rush hour in a taxi so we would recommend that you walk at these times.", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sevenoals, Kent", "Title": "\u201cRave about the Rialto\u201d", "Author": "BigTaps", "ReviewID": "UR5037937", "Content": "Just returned from a great week in Sydney. 5 of us in the family including 3 boys (14, 10 & 4) Yes, believe the reviews - this is an excellent place to stay.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment which we got for a really good value rate. The apartments are very newly decorated/modern and our apartment on the 43rd floor had a nice view out towards Darling Harbour and beyond to I presume some of Sydneys suburbs. The 2 bedroom apartment had two bathrooms (one en-suite) and pretty much a full kitchen. For some reason our apartment didn't have stuff like a frying pan but when we contacted reception they brought it up promptly. The location of the Rialto is superb. Five mins from Darling Harbour and about two minutes from the Queen Victoria arcade and the start of Sydneys very impressive shopping district. 15/20 minutes gets you to the Opera House. The staff were fine although we only needed them to open the luggage storage room really. There are very prominently displayed signs describing the No-Party policy. This policy must also be signed at checkin. We got the impression that there is a problem with some rowdy guests causing hassles on weekends . Other signs warn that some of the balconies are locked as previous guests have been throwing stuff off them ! We noticed that on Saturday night there were a few people getting into lifts who looked the worse for wear. Sun/Mon nights were totally quiet.. The only complaints I had were that the lifts are pretty busy at weekend which made getting down to the local bottleshop a bit of a pain. I would absolutely not hesitate to stay in these apartments again.

I cannot believe that in a 54 story highrise they only have 3 elevators, and the programming and scheduling of them is completely illogical. One morning, we waited over 20 minutes just to get to the lobby as two lifts were parked on the lobby while the other was packed with guests and luggage coming down for check-out. 2) our room was infested with dozens of Bogon moths flying about. The staff said they were migrating and take refuge in any high-rise, which may be true, but they said nothing could be done. There must be a hole in our room somewhere, because we would finish getting rid of them (I killed over 30 moths one night) and the next morning they were back, flying everywhere and invading our luggage, bedding, toiletries, and food. It made our stay VERY UNPLEASANT. I'm sure other hotels had much better means of dealing with them than the Meriton Rialto.
