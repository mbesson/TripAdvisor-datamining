The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful, and the hotel is quite posh looking. Our room contained two beds, and it was decorated in a modern and fun fashion. For example, we had lollypops waiting for us on our pillows instead of the usual chocolates at night. Additionally, the room contained a safe, toiletries, and a hair dryer. The free wi fi in the room was also greatly appreciated. Location-wise, the hotel was very close to Las Ramblas and the Cathedral. Thankfully, the hotel was on a side street, which we found to be quite quiet and peaceful compared to these areas. The hop on/hop off busses were nearby - we thought this bus was a necessity given the huge size of Barcelona and the distance between the main attractions and sights. We went back and forth regarding whether we should stay in another area (the Eixample, etc.) or stay closer to Las Ramblas. I am happy with the choice that we made. The only negative is that the hotel was incredibly expensive compared to our other stays in Spain. Of course, we picked the one weekend when Barcelona was playing Madrid for football, so perhaps that led to the high room prices. I can't say that we received a room that was comparable to the money we spent.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Godalming", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best\u201d", "Author": "steve c", "ReviewID": "UR128045643", "Content": "You couldn't find a better location, central to everything going on, with just enough privacy to escape the masses.

We passed on the expensive breakfast, but my wife enjoyed the upstairs pool area in her downtime whilst I watched the multitude of channels dedicated to Lionel Messi. Barca is a big city whose attractions are spread far and wide, so a judgment on location is particularly subjective. For those looking to be close to the old Gothic Quarter, and close to La Ramblas without being fully immersed in its chaos day and night, this is the perfect choice. Tucked away in a side street near the old Cathedral, you are close enough to the action that you can walk to your destination, but also get a good night\u2019s sleep.

Superior double on the first floor (which is really the 2nd floor). 950 E. On the corner, view of an interesting, natty little piazza with a Vietnamese restaurant that's got outdoor tables, orange umbrellas, heat lamps. The windows very solid so only heard noise of revellers a bit on Friday and Saturday nights, but not enough to prevent sleep. The main sleeping area is boxy, floor-to-ceiling windows, and not huge, but not tiny for two people who like each other. Beds extremely firm. Bathroom large and comfortable--lovely pressure in the shower (but had no hot water one a.m. when we got up late!). Breakfast served in a serene, lovely space with lots of windows. Pros: Location. So nice to be in the barri gotic, but NOT on La Rambla, and in an out-of-the-way alley that is not out of the way at all. Easy walk with luggage to Catalunya, and steps from the old cathedral. Public areas--restaurant, lounge, lobby--did not see pool area--all comfortable and attractive (modern, lots of glass, light fabrics, greens and purples). Staff--helpful and pleasant, though we did not ask much of them. Room--felt like a small oasis; really enjoyed the view--lots of people come and go through that alley, but not all at once, and the scene at the Vietnamese place was interesting and festive (great food, by the way). Cons: they charge 10 euros per day for wireless, which is annoying (fortunately they have 3 computers in the lobby for guests, which were usually pretty easy to get on to--then again, I imagine it could get very busy during high season). The breakfast was OK but not amazing--included in our room price. If I had been paying 22 euros for it, I wouldn't have been too psyched. In all, I felt this was a great hotel in the neighborhood--I would definitely consider returning to this hotel, or finding another in a similar locale. My one suggestion to the management would be go ahead and offer free wireless--it will make your guests very happy.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plymouth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel, great location!\u201d", "Author": "enidblyton_11", "ReviewID": "UR121086220", "Content": "Stayed here with my other half for 3 nights, as a Birthday treat... for me!

I would agree with virtually everything people have said. It is a good hotel in an excellent location, and overall the staff are equally excellent. But to nit-pick a bit I would mention the following three things (and I do this because it was not a cheap hotel to stay at). 1. We were thrilled to see they had tea/coffee making facilities. BUT you had to pay for your tea bags - as we only wanted tea and it was packaged with coffee, we had to pay 1.5 Euros to get two tea bags. We felt this was meanness. 2. You had to pay for internet access in your room - ever so many places these days offer free access. THEN to compound things, you couldn't just buy an hour or two access, you had to pay for 24 hours. We felt this too was meanness. There were 3 free computers in the lobby, but on two occasions two of them were not working - and not only we found this. 3. You can't get your room until 2 p.m. Fair enough - this is the policy of most hotels these days. However, we turned up at 1.50 p.m. and thought maybe our room would be ready. BUT no. We had to wait till 2 p.m. They offered to look after our luggage and told us to go and have a coffee/drink in their bar. We noticed quite a few people doing this. Anyway at 2.02 p.m. we noticed nobody had approached the counter, so my husband did. He said, could we now have the key. \"Certainly\", they replied and handed it over. This then caused a mini-rush from all the other waiting people. The room would certainly have been ready at 1.50 p.m. and again I think it was meanness of their part to make us wait 10 mins.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manhattan, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Peggy593", "ReviewID": "UR118696566", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for one night prior to our cruise, and wish we could have booked it on the way back.

The rooms were also quiet which was nice but we didn't spend most of the day in there. The only issue I had is that the shower again had half a door, that must be a popular thing in many European hotels but I hate that because water gets everywhere in the bathroom. The Host and Hostees at the front desk were completely unhelpful and actually ruinned one of our days. We asked them how to get to Cardonia which was 2 hours outside of the city, we wanted to see the country side with a castle in that area. They gave us the wrong information, first they told us the wrong bus and the wrong time. We asked if the Castle was open on weekends because usually they are limited hours or closed on weekends...they told yes. After we got to the bus station on Sat. we were told we were told the wrong bus, we found the right bus but they didn't leave at 11am like we were told they leave at 1pm and the last bus coming back to Barcelona leaves at 530pm, giving us 30mins to look at the castle and country side. We decided not to do that which runined our whole day so we went on the double decked tour bus again which showed us the Sagrada Familiar that from our travelling book looked lame and we decided not to do it but from the tour bus when we saw the real thing it was absolutely amazing. The Host & Hostees didn't have any info about how to get where or what there was to do, they were completely unhelpful. If you decide to go to this hotel it is right next to the Catherdal church and several resturants around the corner and a 2-3 block walk to Las Ramblas with shops,resturants, and bars. Also do the Flamenco dancing show which is right on Las Ramblas. I was told the beach was at the end of Las Ramblas...that is a lie, the end of Las Ramblas will take you to the pier where there is a couple of resturants but you will have to walk about 5miles to get to the end where the beach is. We made that mistake in believing our hotel again. The beach is not like jamaica's beaches, it looks just like american beaches...light brown with trash on it but its packed when you go. The metro was a block away from our hotel which was nice and the Picasso Museum was a few more blocks away from our hotel about a 15min walk. The location was great because we were in the Gothic part of town which had a lot of old looking type buildings. I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you need suggestions from the front desk. Go to this hotel for a convient stay but make sure you find out all the information about where to go on your own because they will give you wrong information or just say they don't know. No airport transportation but they will call a taxi for you in advanced and you can just stand in the taxi line to get a taxi there. they have a small refrigator but only room for one thing because they have drinks already in there that will be charged to the room if you open them.", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bratislava, Slovakia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel in the heart of Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "jackkk1", "ReviewID": "UR117117573", "Content": "I chose this hotel based on the positive reviews it had received and I have to say it was a good decision.

Despite all this there were some downsides, too. There is not very much storage space in the room and the bathroom door doesn't isolate noise at all so you can hear almost everything. Breakfast was delicious, however you have to order breakfast (except for sweet things and drinks) and there wasn't enough staff to deliver it so sometimes we just ate some croissants and pastries and left without being noticed. The sweet thing were really delicious, though. There are 3 computers in the lobby if you need to connect for free, otherwise you have to pay for the internet.

From day 1 it was obvious that the hotel management & staff were going to be very easy to deal with. Nothing was ever a problem for them, no matter what we asked. We booked almost 100 rooms in the hotel for 4 or 5 days around our wedding and the professionalism from each and every one of the staff was second to none. I dealt alot with N\u00faria, the receptionist, who looked after all of the initial bookings. She was excellent. I also dealt a lot with Susanna, the hotel's commercial director, who helped us plan a drinks reception for our guests the night before the wedding in their stunning & spacious terrace. Susanna too was brilliant and nothing was ever a problem for them. They were always just so pleasant to deal with, which made our lives so much easier in the build up to the wedding. For us the highlights were the friendly & helpful staff, the amazing breakfast, the quietness of the hotel despite its central location (right on the shopping street - Port del Angel, and directly opposite the Cathedral & walking distance to the Borne) and the swimming pool facility on the roof. As you can imagine with so many of our guests staying in the hotel we placed a lot of demands on the hotel staff both in the months leading up to our stay and for the duration of our stay. They went out of their way to facilitate us in every way. We will definitely choose to stay in this hotel whenever we return to Barcelona (which will be a regular occurrence) as will many of our guests...in fact, a few of them have already been back there and told us how great it was again.

The cab took us right to the Hotel and the security guard on duty for the nights & early morning, let us in & we took our bags inside to check them in until we could check into our room later that morning. Really liked the idea of having a security guard monitoring the ins & outs of people at night. The Gentleman at the desk asked for our information & told us that they, in fact, had our room ready if we would like to go ahead and check in. We immediately said, \"Yes, please!\" and within minutes we were in the elevator headed to our room. It was still shy of 7AM so we dropped our luggage, crawled into bed and took a nap! When we awoke at 9AM, we had a chance to check out the room. It was nice, clean & large, with a large bathroom and soft towels. I could tell they wash their towels in a solution of vinegar & water sometimes because while drying off after a shower, you could smell a faint whiff of vinegar. But it was not overpowering and it did not linger long. The sheets were nice & the mattress was firm but all of the mattress' we've slept on in Europe have been firm and not very uncomfortable at all. In fact, after waking up in the mornings without a sore lower back, it made us think that we may need to get a firmer mattress for our bed once we got home. You could make coffee in your room for 1euro 50cents for each cup used but we decided to walk less than 50 yards to the nearest cafe for a cappuccino or 100 yards for a Starbucks coffee or cappuccino. Later that day, we decided to use their free internet to check into our flight the next day. They explained that they do not have a printer on the free computers but to save the boarding passes onto the desktop, then access your e-mail, attach the passes to the e-mail & send it to the hotels e-mail address then they print it out in their office. Well the browser functions are in Spanish so when I got to that point, one of the nice gentlemen at the desk came over to help me. It wasn't sending the barcode to be scanned at the airline gates so he tried it on his own with the same result. So the other gentleman at the desk said that since I was already checked in for the flight, that he would go ahead & use my confirmation # to access the passes & print them out directly. He did that for us and in a few minutes time, we had our boarding passes in our hands for our flight the next day. They were extremely helpful and went above & beyond what they needed to do in order to help us & we thanked them both for their time & help. The location of the hotel is fantastic! You walk out the sliding glass doors, turn left and in 100 feet, you are at the Cathdral square. Then the next block to the right of the hotels street, you walk down there and within 2 blocks you are at the Las Rambla. And the noise was really not a factor in our location. We faced a small side street but the traffic and pedestrian noise never got loud at all. We cannot comment on the restaurants since we did not eat at any of them but with the location, rooms and price we would look into staying at this hotel again if we return to Barcelona.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ctop class hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Louise023", "ReviewID": "UR106989673", "Content": "we spent 5 nights at this fabulous hotel.

Although I specifically asked for a room with a double bed, we were given one with a twin bed. I immediately called the reception to ask for a change of room and they told me that they'd look if there was another available but in the meantime I wasn't to touch anything in that room! OK, it was a reasonable request but it still sounded funny. We were shown to a room with a double bed but the floor looked like it hadn't been swept for a while and the loo like it had been used and not cleaned afterwards. There were distinctive spots on the floor right in front of it... Too tired to make a fuss, I cleaned it myself! Also, the closet space was tiny. Enough room to hang our jackets and nothing more. In every room there are informative brochures about the hotel's services and in one of them I read that the hotel provides guests with complimentary bicycles upon request so in the evening I asked the receptionist if we could have two for the next day. The lad on the desk wanted to rent them to me but when I pointed out that in the brochure it said that there was no extra cost for bikes, he said that he would have to talk to \"somebody\" about The particular \"somebody\" came and gave us the bikes for no extra cost. After that, they kept them in the store room behind the front desk every night because we used them during our entire stay. Very nice of them. Breakfast was alla carte and with not much variety so after a few days it became boring. Upon check in, the young lady at the front desk forgot to give us a map of the city and had to ask for one myself, not sure whether there was extra charge or not. On our check out day, they accepted quite eagerly to keep our luggage for us until the afternoon which was really helpful but when we asked for directions to a place that we couldn't locate ourselves as Bari Gotic is quite complex, the guy at the front desk didn't know and looked it up on the internet. I could have done that myself. Should they have more detailed resources? In the end, he didn't find what we were looking for. The staff didn't seem very professional or knowledgeable of their city.

We could not have been more pleased. We got to the hotel at 8am or so, and even though check in was not until noon, they had a room ready for us in under a half hour. When we first walked into our room, the staff had set up a bottle of champagne, two glasses, and a nice note, welcoming us as honeymooners. The room was newly renovated and very clean, comfortable bed (though firm, which is my preference anyway), gorgeous large bathroom, and ample closet space. The room had its own safe, which was extremely helpful as we never wanted to carry around credit cards or passports (for fear of pickpockets). The location was superb, on the main square of the old historic cathedral. We loved being in the middle of the action of Old Barcelona, but sometimes it was noisy at night becuase of bars in the area (which we didn't mind, but I assume would bother some people...when the window was closed, it blocked the noise quite well). There was always something going on in the square outside the hotel, parades, people dancing, antique sales. The location was very centralized, with 3 metro stops close by - we were able to take the metro everywhere with no trouble for very cheap cost. The AeroBus, which is a bus that takes you to and from the airport (there's a bus for each airport terminal, be sure to get on the right one), has a stop at Placa Catalunya, which is a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and was very convenient. We were there when it was 50-60 degrees fahrenheit, so we would just open the window in the room if we needed air, and didn't touch the thermostat. We loved the roof deck and would go sit out there and drink wine, but it was too cold to swim. We also used the computers downstairs which were very convenient for internet access....we could usually find one open, so we didn't do the in-room Wifi. We didn't eat at the 4 Capellans restaurant downstairs or do any room service, because it seemed expensive and we found some wonderful pastry places nearby to grab something and go.

The Hotel is a fantastic location only about 5 minutes walk from the Placa Catalunya which is where the Blue Airport bus can drop you if you so wish. From the hotel you are really close to La Rambla and the old Gothic quarter which is great for restaurants & bars in the evenings and for exploring during the day. You're probably about 10 to 15 minutes away from the Port / Marina area too. Metro's are close by at Placa Catalunya and Liceu (on Las Rambla) from those you can get to everything else you want to see in the city. Back to the hotel. The guys on reception where great, spoke English (which is great with my very poor Spanish), and where really helpful. We couldn't check in until around 1pm and having arrived at 11:45 ish we decided to sit back and have a beer in the courtyard than at around 12:30 the guys from reception remembered us and checked us in. Not difficult to remember us, but we didn't have to ask, so a tick in the box. The reception area downstairs was pretty comfortable with a little lounge area and the outside courtyard with some comfy sofas. The room was very nice and clean with a good size bathroom and wardrobe for clothes etc. There was a safe in the room (free), TV on the wall & a great big double bed. There were Tea & Coffee making facilities, but you had to pay 1.50 Euro to open the pack, so we didn't bother. On top of this was a stuffed to the brim minibar - it wasn't cheap but it was nice to have the option.

We asked for another room thinking the AC wasn't working but they sent the maintenance man instead. He stuck a thermometer in the AC vent and waited 10 minutes before telling us the AC was working fine. We're very experienced travelers and yes the AC in Europe very often is not like the AC at home. However, the AC in this room was barely working. Too tired to make a scene, we took a nap. We woke to hear music from the hotel lounge below. With the window closed, we could hear the music in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Strangely, we could also hear the toilet flush from another room. The room was small; no lounge chair just footstools and a desk chair. The room was clean and mattress average/hard. The lighting in our room was very dark; there was no overhead fixture. Just spot lights above the bed and a desk light. If we hadn't been exhausted from touring around, sleeping would have been a problem between the lack of AC and noise. There was one front desk attendant that was very helpful, the others not so much.

If you're someone who likes a very large spacious room then you might not have been so comfortable. The roof terrace was nice, but it wasn't possible to swim in the pool as it was freezing cold (in fact, so cold that 3 pigeons were drinking the water when we arrived!). I think the most frustrating issue was that the hotel charged for tea and coffee in the rooms. I stay in a lot of hotels (usually the big chains) for work and have never once been charged for making myself a cup of coffee in the room. In my opinion, this cheapens the hotel - why would you ask your guests who are paying 150 EUR a night to pay an additional 1.50 EUR for coffee in their room?

If you don't present the customer with your best from the start, all other aspects of the service you provide will be clouded. But first let's talk about the positives. A perfect location for first-time visitors to Barcelona. Located across the street from Catedral de Barcelona and one block from La Rambla which will get you on your way to the port or Placa de Catalunya and L'Eixample. The hotel is clean and modern. There is a bar and lounge just off the front desk, a computer room and dining area. The top floor has a pool, though it is rather small (more like a lap pool) and cramped. The rooms are moderately sized with the usual amenities and fairly comfortable beds. The air conditioning, however was a problem. We had three rooms and really only one room had adequate a/c for the two days we stayed. The hallways were quite hot, so I am assuming there was no a/c out there. As with most hotels if you want to eat breakfast at the hotel it's going to be quite expensive. This was the same here. However, if you do take the breakfast, it is quite good with much to choose from and the wait staff were very attentive. Having said all that, now comes the problem area. I booked the hotel directly through the hotel after trading e-mails with the staff ironing out questions and requests that I had. There was 5 of us in our party: 2 adults and 3 minors. So we needed three rooms with two adjoining. The hotel said this would be no problem and we settled on that. I had also told them that we would be arriving early and that if it was possible to check-in earlier than the 2:00 pm check in that would be great, but if not we understood. So we arrived at the hotel and were told that the rooms weren't ready and come back at 2. We stored our bags and began our sight-seeing. When we returned to the hotel a little before 2, tired, hot and jet-lagged we were told our rooms wouldn't be ready for another 1/2 hour to an hour. We argued the point that check-in was at 2, but to no avail. They said that if we hadn't booked adjoining rooms we could check in now. The only solace we were given was that we could get a drink in the bar. 20 minutes later they came back and said one of the rooms was ready. So five people with five suitcases moved into one room. As it turns out, the rooms aren't adjoining, they are across the hall from each other at the end of a hallway. They then added two doors that can be shut so you can walk across the hall in privacy. However, these doors which use the card key to get in are so flimsy that even shut and locked you can still push them open without the key. We eventually got our rooms, but without any recompense or offer of any kind from the hotel.

We enjoyed a lovely breakfast each morning which had both cooked and continental options. Everything was freshly cooked to order and the fresh fruit selection was delicious. We were very impressed with the staff who were efficient, friendly and helpful. The room we had was very quite with a large double bed which was very comfortable.

We had the breakfast included and it was totally worth it. We enjoyed it a lot. The lunch restaurant was also very good. We had lunch once there and for 18 euros we got a three course menu that was one of the best that we had on the whole trip. There was usually some local business people eating at the restaurant. The location is absolutely perfect. Right in the middle of everything and still on a quiet side street. Right from the hotel started huge shopping areas that continued for many kms.

I had high hopes for this hotel since it was rated #18 on tripadvisor. I have to say I was a little dissapointed. This hotel is four stars but I would say it's closer to three stars. When we arrived (with a young child), we were automatically given a smoking room, we were never asked for our preference. In today's world, a hotel should not presume (and I believe few do) that a person would prefer a smoking room unless otherwise specified. We went right back to reception and asked for a non-smoking room. We were told that the hotel was very full but they would get us a non smoking room. Now, you either have the non smoking room or not. Why the lame excuse? We got to our room and it was really hot inside. The air does not come on unless you are actually IN the room and have the key place inside the holder adjacent to the entrance! It took a few hours to cool the room down but even then, the AC was not very powerful at all. In addition, the hotel is so cheap, as soon as the sun goes down, they turn off the AC in the lobby and general hotel areas. When you arrive back from dinner to your hotel, be prepared to be just as hot inside as it was outside. A couple of more odd things. The room did not come with a \"do not disturb\" sign. We called the front desk and a security guard (?) brought us a sign. The following morning we left the room as kept the do not distrub sign up as we did not want housekeeping to come into our room. They came in anyway and they removed the extra key from the slot that powers the room so we once again arrived in a hot room and waited a few hours for it to cool down. We advised the front desk of this and hoped for better the following day but yet again, same scenario. The final blow was the day we checked out. We packed up our stuff walked to the elevator and waited, and waited for the elevator to come. Mind you, it was early and the AC was not really running in the hallways yet and we just stood there sweating. My husband finally walked down the stairs to see what was going on. We were advised that the elevator was broken. I understand that this happens, but a sign advising guest of this and a little help down the stairs with your bags would have been nice. Now, what I did like about the hotel was the location. It is centrally located yet it is very quiet. Since we traveled with our toddler, it was also nice to have a hot water boiler in the room. The rooms were clean and the staff were pleasant enough. If this hotel was selling rooms for 80 Euro's a night, I may have been able to deal with these mishaps, but when I'm paying 130 Euro's a night, I expect more.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cunaccomadating\u201d", "Author": "FabF0urTravelers", "ReviewID": "UR38022090", "Content": "We really wanted to stay at this hotel because of the great reviews.

The lobby was cool and retro and there were plenty of working computer terminals available to check email and browse the web. Alex at the front desk was extemely helpful with finding a great place to eat. The location of this hotel is both great and horrible at the same time. The location is great because it is located right in the heart of the gothic district which means you can easily walk to great restaurants like The Four Cats, and Caracoles, and great museums like the Picasso museum. However, the hotel location is bad for two reasons. It is very difficult to find even for the taxi drivers for one. And second, the Gothic district is the pick-pocketers headquarters so you must be on alert as soon as you leave the property which is very tiring. Be sure to wear your backpack on your front and carry as little of value as possible while exploring the Gothic district. It is full of punks who work in groups to pickpocket travelers.

The hotel was situated in a fantastic location in the old city, almost right opposite the Gothic Cathedral and within a 5 to 10 minute walk to La Ramblas or the Harbourfront. The rooms were soundproofed and it was generally very quiet for a hotel considering its location. The service at the front desk was always helpful and smiley, one member of staff in particular seemed to be able to switch from fluent spanish, to english to french all in a matter of seconds! The room itself was spacious, the bed seemed to be exceptionally firm which took a bit of getting used to! I'm not sure it needed to be quite as solid as that! It had a kettle and cups which was important to me, although you have to pay to use their teabags or coffee. So we knew this in advance and brought our own (I tend to drink other types of tea anyway). It's got a modern slick feel to the hotel and there were a couple of things which were not finished very well in the room, one of the cupboard doors didn't open fully because it stuck on the floor and in the bathroom the shower door wasn't flush on the edge so we had to make sure the door was inside the shower else the water went all over the floor! The shower was great though, nice and powerful. I had a bath one night and it filled up very quickly. The lights by the bedside were touch and you could alter their strength which was handy. We didn't eat at the restaurant, they offered a breakfast buffet for 18euro but we decided to find other alternative options (some great thick hot chocolates and churros!) They were a bit outside or our price bracket. They had a nice outside seating area where you can enjoy a drink though, although we never really saw anybody doing that. They do have a lovely pool upstairs with a tiny gym, it had a nice feel to the pool and is a decent size, it was too cold for us to make use of it though. I noticed after using a cremer in the room that the maid didn't replace it, so I used the other one and she didn't replace that either, not sure if that was because we hadn't paid for the tea packets? Seemed a bit strange to me. They do have Wifi although we didn't bring a laptop so there are the option of the three computers in the lobby which were really useful if you want to check location or opening or timetables! It's not as close to the Gaudi stuff although if you take their metro its really efficient and quick. We walked and it was a great way to see more of the city. There tend to be queues to get into the gaudi houses so its best to try and plan for less busier times of the day if you want to see inside La Pedera and Casa Batila(think thats the name), although La Sagrada Familia is easier to get into there is a queue to go right up and that is well worth the hour wait and extra 2.50Euros each! The room had a mini bar and a safe, we didn't use the safe and the mini bar wasn't included so it was (as most are) pretty pricey.

The pool area was also very small with a limited number of loungers (circa 8) which was not sufficient for the size of the hotel, and on one occasion (out of 2 visits) we had to sit on the wooden decking because no seats were available. Staff were friendly, although discreet. Final bonus was the free wireless internet, and the 3 computers in the lobby for the guests use. We used these to check emails, cat on MSN and to checkin for our flight home. However, there was no printer so we couldn't print our boarding passes which in fairness was not a big problem.

We had a really nice room overlooking the street, we had two single beds instead of a double but it was no big deal, although the beds were quite hard!

It was really warm and the air conditioning unit made little difference even when it was turned down to 5 degrees!

There are plenty of bars nearby though, we usually ended up in Taverne de Bisbe in the Cathedral square for our last drink at the end of the night. We also tried the restaurant next door to the hotel called Nonell, which looks really nice from the outside, with a lovely outside dining area, however my boyfriend had a really bad meal there and they didn't have the wine we wanted so we accepted their reccomendation for a more expensive one which wasn't great either! We always seemed to find nice places to eat in Placa Reial, which you can get to just off Via Ferran.

We chose it from reviews on this site and for its great location. We stayed for 5 nights early April for a city break. It's a great looking hotel inside. The foyer is beautifully designed and immediately restful after the bustle of the streets. You can sit and read in the comfy chairs of the foyer or have a drink from the bar. Reception staff were very pleasant and professional, spoke excellent English and responded to any requests willingly. We chose not to stay in our first allotted room, a lovely room but with a bit of noise from the lift shaft and there was no fuss about changing us. Our room was on the 2nd floor overlooking the courtyard, spotless and modern with some nice design features (funky lights, wall-mounted flat screen TV). The bathroom was very spacious in beige colour stone and suited our needs perfectly. It had a good powerful shower over a large white stone bath. The view from our room, over the hotel courtyard or covered chillout area (! their description) was of the back of the hotel facing the square, so not very pretty, but the room was very peaceful and we werent there that much in the daytime to let it bother us. But I guess that is the toss up - do you ask for a room overlooking the side street with a better view but a bit more noise or do you enjoy the peace and cope with looking at the balconies of the building in front...The only moan about the room was that it lacked a full length mirror and that the girls were very tight with replacing any toiletries that were finished. Also there was no tea after the first lot was drunk but we were warned and bought some more from the bar downstairs along with a jug of milk that we kept in the minibar. You may also have to ask for soap, they provide bath/shower gel, but there was no great problem, reception being happy to send some up. We ate all of our meals out of the hotel. There are plenty of places for breakfast nearby - much nicer to sit and eat watching the world go by and considerably cheaper too. We had a couple of drinks at the bar and outside in the chillout courtyard ( a pleasant decked area covered with tarpaulin to keep off the sun and lined with bamboo plants. Tables and chairs or low sofas to choose from - friendly service). The restaurant didnt operate in the evenings, only at lunch time - something that we werent told beforehand - so we ate out every night. No great hardship though it would have been nice to know there was no \"home\" option before we went. There is room service but only til 9.30pm. We sat on the roof terrace once at the end of the day with books. It's nicely done, with comfy loungers and painted walls. The view is over neighbouring rooftops. The long, thin pool was freezing when I dipped my toe in, maybe it gets warmer as the months go by into summer. We used the gym 3 times. There is one treadmill, one sit up bike and one cross trainer, some free weights, a bench, some wall bars - so small but functional. Again it is newly done with a great view through glass panels over the rooftops. Luckily no one else was interested in using it whilst we were there (I wonder why!) otherwise it would have been a bit of a squash. All in all a great hotel that I would recommend to anyone.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, England", "Title": "\u201cGreat central hotel\u201d", "Author": "James M", "ReviewID": "UR14650836", "Content": "We chose this hotel based on the reviews on this site and we were not disappointed.

It is a very convenient location, so no complaints there. Would I stay there again: no. There is no shortage of good accommodation in the city, so I would choose elsewhere.

My friend also left her cellphone in the room safe, and they worked with her over the phone and sent it to us at our hotel in Madrid. The hotel itself is new and modern. Our room, which was the standard room, was a good size by European standards, and the bathroom was spacious and pristine. Our room faced the street, and although late at night there was some noise, it was nothing to lose sleep over. There was a new flatscreen TV which offered a few stations in English, as well as a mini bar (that is a bit pricey) and room safe (that camouflages cell phones - beware! ahahaha.) If I had one complaint -- it would be that at times, we could hear the guests in the adjacent room. It was not a huge deal though. In the lobby there are computers for your use, and there is a very comfortable outdoor lounge. We did not use the restaurant, so I cant comment on it. They did offer a breakfast for about 18-20 Euro ($30!!), but there are plenty of places to pick up a bite to eat just steps from the hotel, that are a fraction of the price. It was too cold for the rooftop pool, although it looked great, and they also have a small gym. In terms of location, you are 30 seconds from the Cathedral, and about a 5-10 minute walk to the metro, Las Ramblas, the Picasso Museum - everything. Truly a central and practically perfect location. I booked using the hotel website, and it was quick and convenient. I got a rate (roughly $200 USD per night) that i thought was very competitive with other hotels in its category (4 stars) and location.

At the time of booking we didn't realise that it was in fact the Festival of the Three Kings in Spain and so were slightly worried that it would be very busy. This was certainly not the case. On the eve of the Epiphany the streets became crowded with families watching the parade but apart from that it was pretty quiet for the rest of our stay. Despite the fact that it was a public holiday, all bars and restaurants were still open for business too. The hotel seemed quiet although we did use it as a base only and had all our meals out and about. We were very impressed by the size of the room. The room was spotlessly clean and we had fresh towels every day. Huge, super king size bed, the down side being that it was extremely hard and uncomfortable. The bathroom was large too with extra toiletries if needed. There is a hairdryer supplied in the bathroom but the one in ours didn't work although I'd taken my own so it wasn't a problem. Again, a slight criticism was that the tea & coffee supplies are for your arrival and not topped up during your stay. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful too. We flew to Gerona airport and then arrived in Barcelona by coach so on our departure, the reception staff very kindly printed out a timetable for the Gerona coaches so that we didn\u2019t miss our flight home! The location of the hotel is perfect. You are a 5 second stroll from the Cathedral Square and only 5 minutes from Playa de Catalunya and La Rambla. Probably only a 20 minute walk to the Barcaloneta area and the beach which is well worth a visit. We did the cable car ride which has the most amazing views over the city. We also purchased a one day tourist bus ticket (in hindsight should have got a 2 day!) which we used to explore the north of the city. Stopped off at Sagrada Famillia and Park Guell which were amazing. We were very lucky with the weather whilst in Barcelona too. On arrival in Gerona it was raining but then you are close to the mountains. Once in Barcelona we had our first day at about 16 degrees and then the last two it was 20 degrees and sunny still at 4:30 in the afternoon! We did feel very strange though as for the locals this is still cold. So whilst we were wandering around in jeans and t-shirts, they were wrapped up in thick coats and scarves!

For the money and after traveling much of the world, this is a pretty good deal if you are on a Euro budget, or want to consume more wine or tapas (which is myself), but if you have an excess of Euros, and want something a little grander, you may be disappointed. Although the bed looks lovely, the mattress and pillows are rock hard and in serious need of replacement. The walls are paper-thin and I could hear the TV and conversations in the next hotel room. Lastly, a good majority of the rooms face the alley and unless your a hard sleeper or hard of hearing, you will hear all of the end of the night goodbyes.
