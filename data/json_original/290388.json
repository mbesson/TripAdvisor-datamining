We read about 10/12 reviews regarding the hotel and all were very positive, so we took the plunge and booked in for 4 nights in April. We were not disappointed in either Berlin or the Hotel. The Hotel location is spot on Checkpoint Charlie, which during the cold war, formed a very significant part of Berlin's more recent history. We had a small but spotlessly clean room on the 5th floor which of a night was wonderfully quite as this hotel is positioned slightly away from the more active part of the city. However the local underground station (line U6) is literally across the road and from there you can travel anywhere within Berlin's historical city. We included the breakfast in our booking and with a mixture of hot and cold food, along with fruit and cereal, was more than adequate for any palate. The staff are astute, helpful, intelligent and very informative regarding Berlin's tourist hot spots and lucky for us spoke perfect English as our German leaves a lot to be desired. We never actually had an evening meal in the hotel however the menu look extensive and the price was reasonable for a City hotel, with even a two for one offer over the weekend. We both enjoyed our visit to Berlin and if we ever returned would have no hesitation in booking the Angleterre again. Lastly if you have time, spend a few hours in Potsdam which is about an hour away from Berlin by train (line S7). A wonderful German historic town on beautiful lakes and rivers, very relaxing.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bergen norway", "Title": "\u201cexellent choise for Berlin\u201d", "Author": "BergenNorwayJog", "ReviewID": "UR127459024", "Content": "just got back from a 4 nights easter trip to Berlin. flew to sch\u00f8nefeld airport..( old airpot... but the new one Brandenburg is opening in may) took the S- bahn to friedrichstrasse station( ca 30 min) and a taxi from there to Angleterre hotel.

The hotel is nice, clean and unfussy. We didn't really have much interaction with the hotel staff other than check in and out but they were pleasant. Breakfast was great; one day was continental with a great selection of cheese, meats, cereals, yoghurts and fruits. The other days there was also a hot breakfast too. It is buffet style and certainly sets you up for the day. The rooms are quite plain and also unfussy but importantly they are spotlessly clean.

I asked if there was a treadmill or any cardio machine, and the guy just shook his head and said \"no no no, its not very good\".

Maybe it was because the hotel was fully booked, but it looked like the staff struggled to keep up with the amount people they had in the restaurant, so food items where not being replenished quickly enough and there always seemed to be a lack of crockery, and i had to ask each morning for cereal bowls. Maybe the management should look at the staffing levels in the kitchen/restaurant which would hopefully sort this out and take some pressure off the staff, so that the hotel clients would be getting a better service.

Reading lights, for example, are rather far from bed and not adjustable, so reading by night is almost impossible. Bathroom amenities are limited to dispensers of cheap soap/shampoo. And, worse for a working traveler, wifi is only available in the lobby (for a hefty charge unless you use the one available computer post), and rooms only have an old-fashioned USB cable that did not fit my Macbook. They charge extra for everything: internet at 3 EUR per hour or 15 EUR per day, gym and sauna for 10 EUR, breakfast for 17 EUR. All in all, this hotel leaves you with a sense of a slight rip off. On the up side, reception staff is really nice, and location is very convenient - the Kochstrasse U-Bahn is right at the door, and you can hop on it and get to Under den Linden in five minutes.

The architecture may be confusing. Internet access is available through a media company. \u20ac15 / day for Ethernet access at the room. \u20ac3 / hour. Absolutely inappropriate for business use. The hotel issued a disclaimer about the service, re-directing the customers to the media company ( that also offers the pay TV etc. etc.) The only English speaking TV stations that you will find is BBC News and SKY News. No way to see something different than news in English unless you pay for \u20ac15 for a B or C class movie.

We arrived slightly early so our room was not ready but the reception staff were more than happy to look after our bags until it was ready. The hotel is very clean, rooms nice if a little dated but ideal for a mini break. We booked for \"the best room available\" which excluded breakfast but included a 10 euro a day per room voucher which we chose to use in the bar before eating out each evening. Breakfast at 17 euro each was a little pricey but if you come out of the hotel and turn right and walk for on a couple of hundred metres there are a few cafes which served a nice breakfast for only 4 euro's - we went there each morning - stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. The hotel is ideally located and close to all sites - the reception staff were always willing to help you and give advice on directions etc - you could not fault them - very polite and efficient. We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food other than the hotel restaurant looked decidedly quiet when we took a peek one night. We chose to eat near Friederick Strasse station and in particular a very nice vietnamese restaurant which served great food at a reasonable price - 6-7 euros for a main course. Cannot remember thename of it but if you need directions let me know. I would stay in this hotel again - definitely - drinks were a little expensive - 2 beers 9 euro's but came with a bowl of nuts - i guess usual hotel prices - much cheaper away from the hotel but nice to visit the bar for a drink before you venture out for the evening. Friendly staff in the hotel bar too. Top tips - take a travel kettle as there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the room - especially if you do not go for the breakfast option. Also buy the Berlin welcome card at the airport when you arrive it allows free travel for the duration of you stay ie 24 48 or 72 hours depending on what you chose. Also but it at the airport and not on the plane as we did as you have to queue to redeem the voucher the airline sell you - no queue if you just buy it at the airport itself. Not sure how the buses train and U Bahn make their money. We purchased our ticket and it stayed in our bags until we got home. It was not checked even once.

We travelled to the Angleterre Hotel from Berlin-Schonefeld airport via train to Friedrichstrasse station and then changed to the U6 subway for the short remaining journey to Kockstrasse. The journey takes less than 1 hour and can be made using an 'ABC' ticket which costs just over 6 Euro or you can buy a Berlin WelcomeCard for travelling throughout Zones ABC for periods of 48 or 72 hours. The Berlin WelcomeCard can be bought at the airport and makes travel throughout Berlin on trains, subway, buses and tram really easy. The Berlin WelcomeCard also provides discounts on many tourist attractions. I would recommend buying one if it is your first visit to Berlin. On arrival at the Hotel, we found the hotel staff exceptionally friendly and very willing to help with our basic tourism enquiries in addition to questions about the Hotel. We upgraded to a comfort suite by paying an additional 10 Euros per night but we were lucky enough to only be paying 55 Euro per night anyway (a Bargain!). The facilities in our room were excellent (even if we were paying twice the room rate I would say that) and anything further that was required such as extra pillows were provided for by reception without hesitation. Broadband was 3 Euros per hour or 15 Euros for 24 hours and could easily be switched on and off by connecting your laptop to the network cable in the room. For those without a portable device, broadband is available through the TV too. We did not have breakfast at the Hotel as we prefer to find alternatives elsewhere when in a busy city.

We arrived Tegel airport and searched for bus 128 to take us to Kurt-Schumacher's U-Bahn station that eventually took us to Kochstrasse station, 50 metres from the hotel. That was much appreciated on the snowy city. Kochstrasse station was one stop away from Stadtmitte, so between shopping it was fast to stop by at the hotel. We bought straight off the three-day card for public transport (some 23e each). Only on the last trip back to Tegel we were asked to show our tickets. Berlin's public transport is based on trust and let's respect that. The hotel itself was easy and good value for money. Friendly staff. Room was spacey, a bit worn, but nothing that really mattered. Pillows could've been better though. Our window was towards the yard inside, so perhaps what we lost in the view, we gained in sleeping quality.

Firstly, we flew into Schonefeld airport, which a few miles out of the center. We decided to get the train (opposite the airport) and head into the center of Berlin and then proceed to the hotel. There was approx 6/7 English people at the train station all wanting to get to Alexander Platz (most famous train station in center) and we ALL managed to get on the wrong train! None of the signs are clear, there is no information center and not one member of staff to let you know where to go. Because of this, we got royally lost for 2 hours, switching from train to bus to tram and finally taxi!! Eventually this took us to the hotel. A taxi from this airport to the hotel is about 40 euro which is MUCH more expensive than the train etc but if you get lost easily and don't know anything about the public transport, this may be the best option for you! Public transport on a whole was very confusing. You buy a ticket at the machines, stamp the tickets yourself in one of the red boxes and then board the train. After buying a ticket and noticing no one had checked we had one, and there was no need to show you had purchase one when getting off the train, we saw a window of opportunity! Beleive it or not we did not pay for more than 1 train/underground ticket while we were in Berlin! This may have been just luck, however Germany obviously puts a lot of trust in the German people to buy tickets etc...we gathered we were English so we didn't count :P Bargain haha! The hotel is located right in the center of Mitte (center) just down the road to Check Point Charlie. East Berlin is the most cultural side of Berlin so the hotel is in a perfect location. Although I have noted the benefits of public transport, everything in Berlin is well within walking distance. We did an English speaking Walking Tour and we saw everything there was to see and they were all within a few blocks of each other. Would highly reccomend a walking tour also, as many of the points of interest you would just walk past and not notice, yet these were the most important and interesting things we saw whilst in Berlin. As noted before the hotel has a perfect location, and if any English people want to take advantage of the public transport there is an underground station opposite the hotel. There is also plenty of restaurants and shops near to the hotel. The cuisine in Berlin was not the best, and looking back, we did wish we would have researched some places that were good to eat before we went, so this would be a good hint for you before you go. I have no reccomendations as there was no where I particularily liked. The hotel reception and exterior are very impressive, and did live up to its 4 stars. The rooms were all spacious and the beds were VERY comfortable however not the biggest. They charge you to use the TV and the snacks in the rooms are NOT complimentary, however the room has everything you would really need. The bathroom was ok and very clean with bath and shower and then a hair dryer (so no need to pack that). The only toiletries were a squirty thing in the bathroom that you use for both shower gel and shampoo....didn't use this haha so take your own. Also, the shower glass seperator leaks so be careful! Reception staff were helpful and they showed us how to get to alot of places. Some places of interest for us was The Jewish Museum, Walking tour which will cover most of the historical important stuff, Check Point Charlie Museum, Haulocaust Memorial and museum and the Christmas Markets. The Christmas Markets were SO pretty however extremely over priced! Nice to have a look at though. Every one in Berlin kept telling us that we should come in Summer instead because it was better so this maybe something to consider. The German people were (I hate to sound like a typical English complainer...) somewhat abrupt and was reluctant to say \"please\", \"sorry\" or \"thank you\", so as you can imagine being typically English it was SO FRUSTRATING!! In fact, me and my friend joked that Berlin had been created to be everything an English person would hate...not a chip in sight on any menu (haha), pushing in, everything written in German and no translation in English, no sauces other than mustard (yuck!) etc etc etc...however don't let this put you off. It gives you an excuse not to be obnoxious without feeling guilty :) Overall though, very nice hotel, very clean and in excellent location and very reasonably priced. A very good choice.

Despite the fa\u00e7ade, this is a modern hotel. On arrival at 8pm, and despite booking months ago, we were told that no standard room (as booked) was available. They put us in a \u2018superior\u2019 room on the 8th floor \u2013 if we wanted to remain in this room for the whole of our stay, then it would be an extra \u20ac40 per night. This was a no-brainer having paid not much more than this per night for a standard \u2013 so we opted to move the next day. It was irritating that a standard wasn\u2019t available, and that we had to move rooms - we wondered if this was some sort of ploy to get us to pay more! The standard room was absolutely fine and the only difference appeared to be a larger hall-way and a tea & coffee making tray, but everything else, including the bathroom was exactly the same. Other than this niggle, we had a great stay here. The room was spotlessly clean and despite our being there during the World Cup, we never heard any noise. The bathroom is compact, but functional. Shampoo/shower gel was from a wall mounted dispenser (not posh stuff, but it did the job) and a soap dispenser for the sink (not seen that before!). There\u2019s also a pretty decent hair dryer in the bathroom. As other posters have said, it is next to the U-bahn Kochstrasse station (U6 line), which gives easy access to the rest of the (absolutely brilliant) public transport network. Breakfast was part of our deal and was good and plentiful , everything being replenished promptly as and when required. All the staff that we encountered, including the front desk and breakfast staff, were charming and helpful. As mentioned above, the Berlin public transport system is something we can only dream about. Fast, efficient, clean and cheap \u2013 we used all of it \u2013 U Bahn/S Bahn, bus and tram for getting around. We would recommend that you purchase the 48 / 72 hour tickets (depending on length of your stay), which are a bargain. We purchased the Berlin Welcome Card 72 hour card for \u20ac25.90 (for zones A,B & C), as it gained entry to some museums etc as well as all of the public transport, including from the airport \u2013 Schonefeld, Zone C. We reckon we saved a fortune \u2013 go to Berlin tourist website for more details. It\u2019s also easy to get from the airport to the hotel using this card. We bought our Card at the airport, then caught the Airport Express. If you are staying at the Angleterre, you can catch either the RB14 or the RE7 train at the airport \u2013 signed \u2018Airport Express\u2019 \u2013 and it takes around 20 minutes to get to the centre of Berlin. We got off at Friedrichstrasse, and then changed to U6 line (get on U-bahn train with destination Mariandorf) and get off at Kochstrasse \u2013 hotel virtually next to the station. Much better than spending many Euros on a taxi and so easy.

What we got was a modern, very clean hotel with friendly and efficient staff who seemed to take please in helping us in every way. On arrival we were given a local map of the area and were recommended areas to eat and drink. Our room was on the 8th floor which can be accessed by the lift using our door key (card), which itself turned the lights etc on and off as we entered and left the room (so no worries about leaving the iron on, etc). The room was very tidy and clean with a safe and hairdryer as promised, the bathroom was again spotless and the shower was easy to use and hot/warm or cold was easily mixed. The room opened onto an internal courtyard, (with sliding doors and a balcony rail), which was very quiet at all times, in fact we never heard anybody and only saw signs of life when in reception even though the hotel was busy. The room had aircon, which if I was being fussy was slightly loud but we got used to it very quickly. When signing out we were asked if we had bought anything from the food/drink cabinet in the room (which we didn't) and we were told everything was fine and thanked for our visit. As our flight was not until 3.45pm and the room was to be vacated at 12pm, the receptionist allowed us to store our bag, without charge, in a designated room until later which allowed us a few more hours in Berlin. The hotel also booked our taxi to the airport. Also, very importantly, the hotel is opposite a police station. We never heard or saw any trouble whilst we were there, not just because of the poilce station but because its just a great, friendly place were we walked the streets at midnight without worry. Finally, as I mentioned it being a great location, if you turn right out of the hotel and walk 250 metres you end up at Check Point Charlie and the underground which takes you anywhere in the city very efficiently and safetly. The shops, coffee bars and pubs are superb with english speaking staff who again are friendly and efficient. I would recommend Maximillians pub on the Friedrichstra\u00dfe (the road outside the hotel leading towards and past CPC), just look for a large statue of a fat man in lederhosen! Great beer and food - try the currywurst. One last thing, go on a boat trip. You will see loads of beautiful buildings and it will give you ideas where to visit as there are lots of 'hidden' bars along the river that we did not see from the main road. 10 out of 10, for everything.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bristol", "Title": "\u201cCentrally located, convenient for sightseeing\u201d", "Author": "george7mc", "ReviewID": "UR37718124", "Content": "We arrived very late as our flight was delayed.

To call this establishment a 4 star hotel, takes a considerable imagination. I booked a deluxe room, so was expecting it to be a bit special but the room was bland and the furniture tired, it looked as though it had not been updated for 15+ years. Instead of having a double bed as I requested, it had two single beds joined together, each with their own single duvet (which was only the width of the bed, so sleeping without the duvet coming off was a bit of a challenge). So, was unable to actually cuddle up to my husband on what was supposed to be a romantic weekend break. It also had only 1 desk chair in it, in a room clearly designed for two people. If this was their deluxe room, I shudder to think what their standard room was like. The Room description also said it had a city view, but the view was actually of a car park again a big disappointment. The bathroom was reasonable modern, but had none of the accoutrements one would expect in a deluxe room at a 4 star hotel. No bottles of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel or soap. Instead it had a soap dispenser by the sink and in the bath/shower, the type of arrangement you would expect at a budget hotel such as a Premier Inn or Holiday Inn Express. The room we had on the first night smelt musty, in fact the whole area on the 3rd floor had that smell. The carpet had some large black stains on it, the walls were marked and the curtains dingy. When we had a word with the reception staff about it after our first night, they changed the room to one on the 4th floor. This room was slightly cleaner, had an additional chair, but still smelt musty as did the entire 4th floor corridor. On the Plus side the room had very high ceilings and the staff were very helpful and friendly.

The room was brilliant - quite typical 4* to be honest. Our \"Double Room\" did consist of two single beds pushed together with single bedding to match, however the free bags of haribo left on the pillows began to make up for that! The maid service was so unobtrusive that we never saw them despite them clearly having been in every day! The location is relatively central - excellent for Checkpoint Charlie, the Wall Museum, Jewish Museum etc. The Reichstag building and Gendarmenmakt are both walkable if 15 - 20 minutes isn't too far for you. The u-bahn is very easily accessible anyway (there's a lift for wheelchair users at Kochstrasse too). We didn't use the hotel bar or restaurant, as (similar to what other reviewers have said) there are a wealth of these all around the local area and the rest of Berlin. The red fronted cafe directly over the road to the left is perfect for breakfast, and there's a Starbuck's on the corner in the other direction if that's more your thing. Very nice and very inexpensive restaurants - \"Appetito Italiano\" - turn right after Checkpoint Charlie as a previous reviewer noted (thanks for that!), or a little further away walking is \"Cafe Mohring\" on Charlottenstrasse at the Gendarmenmarkt. The hotel staff were friendly throughout our stay; we were greeted every time we were passed in the corridors and lifts. When we asked about where to buy stamps for postcards the receptionist charged us for stamps and took our postcards to post himself.

Online the Angleterre was cheap and looked really good. We paid 69 Euros for a single room (we each got a room). Our only hesitation was that it wasn't in the neighbourhood that we wanted and seemed that it was in a very commercial part of Berlin. The cab ride was quick enough. The hotel lobby was simple but nice with wood accents. The staff was a bit reserved but friendly enough. The rooms were really excellent. Single rooms had two single beds side by side. The room is all wood and the bathroom is slate floors that are heated. It is all new with very clean appliances. There was also a wall of sliding doors to store your luggage with a safe, again all in wood. I felt in the lap of luxury. A friend we met who was travelling as well came over for a drink and couldn't believe how nice the place was and the deal we had. We like that kind of reassurance ;) About the area: The subway is right across the street and it is very efficient. We loved the subway in Berlin and wished it were like that back here in Chicago and Toronto. Stuff like time display showing the time for all in-coming trains, motion censored escalators, no huge power sucking lcd screens, the fact that you can drink on the train and they sell beer and wine right in the station, the list goes on and on (I digress) The point is that you can get around until about 12:30 a.m using the subway, and later on the weekend (I believe 2, but maybe later) And there is also an all night street car that brings you close to the hotel, but I dont remember much from that night so no details. The food in the area is bad, do not go to the touristy cafeteria down the street. The mexican place was good and the restaurant hotel is good (but expensive).

I stayed for 5 nights in total and after a couple of days, i decided to let it go and try and enjoy the city and hotel. But my god, is it difficult to get a smile or even hello out of anyone in the hotel. Afteranother couple of days i gave up on that as well. I only ate in the bar one eveing, it was fine.", "Date": "March 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottingham, uk", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "janpan", "ReviewID": "UR6011320", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at this hotel; it was very clean, modern looking and the staff were friendly and helpful.

I agree with other reviewers that the hotel is in a good position - Checkpoint Charlie is just down the road. We arrived from Shoeneberg airport, and got the train direct from there to Friedrichstrasse main station. From there, get the underground to Kochstrasse station. The hotel can be seen from either exit. We would recommend this hotel to our friends.

I was a little concerned because I had read some reviews about the staff being a little rude, however, we thought they were great! The hotel is located a few blocks up from Checkpoint Charlie and is in easy walking distance to other great sites. Our room was rather large and very clean. The only drawback, as someone else has mentioned, is that in order to make a king/double bed, they pushed two twins together, so I kind of fell in the middle a few times... Other than that, it was great! We booked through ---- and as part of their service we received a complimentary drink in the bar, plus we didn't have to give a credit card in order to reserve the room since we arrived before six pm. That was another great thing- we arrived around 11 am and they had a room ready even though check-in wasn't supposed to be until after 2 pm. Highly recommended and very good for the price.", "Date": "October 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "merseyside", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "oscarfogg", "ReviewID": "UR5937775", "Content": "Great Hotel, nice and clean, rooms average size for a city hotel.

The location of the hotel is ideal - just by Checkpoint Charlie and within easy walking distance for all the major sites - Brandenburg Gate, TV Tower, Reistag etc. The Hotel is also situated on one of the most fancy streets in East Berlin - loads of designer shops. Berlins underground (U-Bahn)and S-Bahn are easy to use if you don't fancy walking. Get a city tourcard as this works out cheaper if you intend to use the underground a lot. The locals were all very friendly and welcoming. Make sure you visit Gendenmarket (just by this hotel) and sit and have a beer early evening. Also don't miss the chocolate shop just by Gendenmarket - amazing !
