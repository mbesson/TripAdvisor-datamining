We stayed 2 nights here. The Building itself is quirky, the very narrow steep typical staircase of the houses in Amsterdam. The bar is extremely well-kept and although we did't breakfast here (pretty highly priced) I can imagine that the food tastes pretty good and is also of good quality. The huge Mac PC's are a great thought, and are free to use! very big plus! The desk staff was EXTREMELY helpful!!! He answered every question I had, helped mark the way on a map, and ordered us a taxi for our early flight. The only complaint I have about the whole place is that I feel a little mislead by the pictures posted here. Our room was clean, but the overall appearance wasn't that great. But if you're not a luxury traveler, there's really nothing to complain about here. ALSO, the location is really good. Within walking distance of bars and pubs (but still a quiet stay), very close to a WONDERFUL street market that we loved, and not too far from the Heineken experience.

The staff were friendly, and gave good recommendations for dinner. Something that concerned us though, was security. We had to get buzzed in to the hotel from the street, but the staff didn't necessarily know us when they allowed us in. Then we told the staff member our room number and they simply handed over our key (which we had to leave in the office when we were out), not asking for a name or anything. Anyone could have said they were in our room, which made us a little uncomfortable. Of course, we never had a bad experience, but it was a concern during our stay.

The hotel took the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd payment out of my CC + 4% CC charges. Then I was charged another 85 Euro security for the first night from my CC. This security should not have been charged since full payment was already taken. So instantly I was out of pocket 85 euro, a simple mistake on their part that I thought could be fixed on arrival. On arrival I asked if I could pay in cash, this was refused. I was lumped with the 4% whether I liked it or not, full payment was already deducted. All Amsterdam hotels charge an extra % on CC, but they also give you a choice to pay in cash, all except Aalborg. Secondly they refused to refund my $85 which was their mistake!! The staff said the bank would reverse the security (reserve) after 1 week. When I explained I was short in funds and needed that money for my last couple of days stay, I was still refused and disregarded, being treated poorly. I approached 4 different staff members on this issue of the over charge, including the managers/owners, only to be told it was not possible. I contacted my bank, Aalborg can and should have reversed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reserve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of 85 Euro. This is poor form on Aalborg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part, they failed to deliver here and it was an easily reversible mistake on their part. Rooms in Amsterdam are noisy, but Aalborg would have to be one of the worst I have been in, there was constant noise from the rooms.

My favourite boutique hotel located in the Jordaan district [Hotel Van Onna] was fully booked for the time of my stay. Hotel Aalborg is located south of the old centre of town, overlooking Sarphatipark. It is easily accessible by tram from Centraal Station. Tram #25 passes the door. The tram #4 stop is about 200 metres away. Travel from Centraal station takes about 15 mins. You can walk to Dam Square in about 30 minutes and to the Rijksmuseum & Van Gough Museum in about 10 minutes. Reception was courteous & professional. My room was located on the 3rd floor at the rear of the building, facing south. It was light and airy with sunshine all day. There is a lift to all floors, which is much better than using the very steep, small stairs that are so common in Dutch buildings. Whilst the room was very small, it was clean & tidy and had everything needed for a single traveller. It included a small wardrobe, table & chairs, clock radio, phone, small wall-mounted TV and heating. The recently renovated bathroom was adequate with good towels & toiletries. The unusual half-sized sit-down bath, made showering very difficult. The tall sides also made it difficult to set in and out, particularly if you had limited mobility. There were no tea or coffee making facilities. Breakfast [additional EU9] is available downstairs adjacent to a fully stocked bar which is open 24hrs a day. Drinks can be brought to your room if required. The only negative was the poor soundproofing of the rooms.

I booked at the last minute online while sitting in Berlin Hauptbahnhof waiting for the night train to Amsterdam, and got a decent price compared to many other hotels near the center of Amsterdam. I believe it was 65EUR/night or about $100USD at the time. For what I paid you could say I expected expected more from this hotel. My roomo was about the size of a closet, not very large at all. While I can manage small spaces, many people cannot, and this would be an issue. I had read many different perspectives on the staff before checking in, and I from my experience they were nothing but professional. I stayed on the second floor and you have the choice of taking the very small elevator or the very steep and narrow winding stair case to get to the other floors. The stairs were often dark, and i could easily see someone falling down them (I however had no issues--YMMV). Back to the room. Yes, it was very small, but it did have everything your needed. Bed with clean linens, a heater at the end of the bed, desk, phone, tv, full bathroom, etc. The desk is so close to the bed that i never bothered using the \"chair\" and just used the bed as one. On the note of the bathroom, I will say that mine had what I shall term the death shower. I noticed that it had an incredibly high wall and was intended to be one of those bathtubs where you can sit one end elevated. This unfortunatley can make taking a shower a bit of a balancing act, and yes I did slip a few times. Getting out, just as getting in, could be problematic for some, with the height of the tub (especially with wet feet!). There is a continental breakfast and it is rather standard and nothing to write home about. Also, one must relinquish their key each time they leave the property. You simply just have to ask for your room key when you return. However, I noted that they dont check who you are, so theoretically it could be easy for a thief to gain access to your room. I did not see any evidence of this during my stay, and I did not feel like this would happen to me, but as a precaution (and this goes for any hotel), leaving valulables out in the open in your room would not be the best idea. Location wise, this hotel is convinently located within the same tram zone as central Amsterdam, with a stop just 1 minute walking distance away. Also, across the street is Sarphatipark, and nearby are several markets. If one really wanted to, one could easily walk to central Amsterdam and just take the tram back.

Upon check-in, he disclosed an additional cost for credit card payment. I had called him twice in advance to tell him my credit card number, but he had never told me about the extra charge. I was going to pay the charge, but I just wanted to tell him that customers usually want to know those hidden costs in advance, so that other customers would not feel bad in the future. Surprisingly, he became defensive and yelled at me, \"You never told me that you were going to pay with a card!! So I don't have to tell you about that! ALL the hotels in Amsterdam charge extra for credit card \". This is not true. I had stayed at another hotel in town the night before, and that hotel did not charge any. When I said that, he became very excited and blasted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am going to call another hotel (to prove that), hotels charge extra!!! But I am not going to call the hotel you stayed last night! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Do you work for hotel industry? I do!!! I never had a problem with my guests!!!! Look, I wasted 20 minutes of my time when you called me over the phone.\" Then he started to intimidate me, \"You must get out of this hotel if you do not want to pay. We will charge you anyway! \" I told him that I had never said I would not pay, and asked him why he was making up a story, like I did not wish to pay. Then he said, \"then why do you put your card back to your purse. (I never put my card back to my purse, by the way.) Do you want a room, or not!!?? If you don't pay, get out of here!\" Then even after I paid, he humiliated me, saying I was probably on a drug or should go to a mental hospital. So I told him that he was unbelievably rude and nasty. At this point, as other guests came over to listen to our argument, he suddenly smiled and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Ok, I am rude, OK?\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Then he told me to leave the reception area immediately, or otherwise, he said, he would call the police. I told him that I did not have to leave because I had paid already. Then, amazingly enough, he really called the police and said something to the police in Dutch to scare me. Anybody can imagine how scary it can be when a person of that country calls police and communicates a false story! You could get arrested even if you are doing nothing wrong! So this guy resorted to this nasty technique to scare me. This really shows what kind of person this guy is. After all these horrifying, dreadful experience, I reluctantly stayed at this hotel because I did not want to waste any more time or money only because of this pitiful, pathetic man. The man insisted that all he was saying was right because he was \"studying marketing\", but I really feel sorry for him that he has no ability to understand customers' needs and minds. His character of easily losing temper and blasting to customers, and the fatal lack of compassion, is a proof that there is no way that he can make a good, or even modestly good, marketing person. Anyway, you should stay away of this hotel. Don't go. The rooms are tiny and overpriced, as other reviewers have described. But more importantly the staff described above is rude and nasty. (I don't know about other staff, but if this guy sits in the reception, you could get into a trouble.) When there is no problem, he might seem a nice guy, but you come to know true personality of his when something happens. If you complain, he will never apologize or help you, but, instead, will intimidate, threaten, harass, scare and insult you. So, again, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t repeat my mistake, and stay away of this hotel, forever!", "Date": "July 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cnice and friendly at good location but small with suicide shower and hidden fee\u201d", "Author": "CXX", "ReviewID": "UR8206745", "Content": "I liked the design, the garden, the 24h service, the breakfast.

The shower had a very odd curved floor which made it nearly impossible to stand, it was a half-sized sit-in bathtub. They had a shower mat in there which upon first use slipped away and nearly killed me. Without the mat showering was still a struggle, and I couldn't dare to move.

On arrival, we were given room 35, which was a the back of the hotel, in a most pleasing and quiet area. the room was very adequate, bathroom was large enough, room spotless and I am told, that the fold down bed was very comfortable. The girl at check in was most helpfull and the hotel appeared very nice. Breakfast, although not a huge spread by any means, was nice and we left at 10AM to travel back home All in all, a lovely hotel in a quiet part of town, away from the hussle and bussle of the centre and at a most reasonable price.

This should have been a single room - whatever you do if you do stay here make sure you dont get room 23. If the room had been renovated it had dodgy laminate flooring and new curtains - the walls looked very dirty and in need of a lick of paint. The double bed was pushed up against the wall, no bedside table - well there was at the end of the bed. There was very little space to walk around the room and the bathroom was a hazard. You could barely stand in the \"toddler\" size bath to have a shower and when you did you just soaked the rest of the bathroom - it certainly wasnt a power shower. The bed was changed and comfy - but i really felt the rest of the room was dirty - i didnt like walking around in bare feet. The staff were friendly enough. We tried the breakfast on our first morning but not again - it was a real episode and you had to keep asking for the breakfast to be replenished. There wasnt anywhere to sit but luckily we managed to get a seat and the table from the previous guests was not cleared. Maybe if the room had been nicer the breakfast hassle may have been acceptable. We didnt complain about the room as i had guessed we were the last people checking in so thought if there was a better room surely they wouldnt have put us in that one. Even though everyone says it is in a good location i do think it is a little far out especially for first time visitors to the City. It was my birthday while i was over there and they put a card and half bottle of champagne as a surprise when we returned to the hotel - a very nice touch but i wouldnt stay there again.

You can take the number 25 tram from almost right outside the door to the city centre as far as central station although you can get to Dam square in around 20 - 30 minutes on foot (this way you get see a few extra sights that you may miss). The staff at the hotel are (as with most people in Amsterdam) very frendly. The hotel also offers a bar and breakfast room.
