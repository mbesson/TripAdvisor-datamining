We stayed here both before and after a Caribbean trip. It is part of a \"complex\" of Marriott hotels including Courtyard and Marriott. The hotel is well maintained with one of the better RI breakfast buffets--but still way to much use of Styrofoam. The evening social was okay with a couple of healthy options but no wine or soft drinks, only lemonade and beer. The other Marriott hotels have dining options including a Starbucks. Unfortunately, there really isn't a grocery store within a reasonable walking distance. The staff was very nice and the room itself was fairly spacious and clean. You have access to a nice size pool at the Marriott and a very decent workout room at the Courtyard. There is free wifi and a computer in the lobby to print board passes. The airport shuttle is free and very convenient. It runs every 15 minutes from very early in the morning until very late. The location of the hotel is great for the airport but not anything else. You can take the bus into Miami but its a long ride and a taxi is around $40 one way. There are a few restaurants within walking distance but nothing very good. There really isn't anyplace to walk or run. My only complaint is that I left a shoe in the room. When we returned after our trip I expected it to be very easy to retrieve but somehow it was nowhere to be found.

We were originally looking at hotels on the beach. The Residence Inn rate was half of what the beach front hotels were charging and we got more for our money. The free airport shuttle picked us up and took us to the hotel in less than ten minutes. Our room was very nicely furnished with a kitchen, dining room table, living room section with a 42 inch flat screen television that swiveled around to face the bed or the loveseat, and a desk for the laptop. The queen sized bed had a new mattress and was very comfortable. Everything was clean, the room was quiet, and there was Wi-Fi access with pretty good bandwidth for watching videos. We had no complaints and had a pleasant stay. We rented a car for a day at the neighboring hotel on the property which we were able to leave in the hotel parking lot before we left for our cruise. South Beach, Coconut Grove, and the Dolphin Mall are all within easy driving distance. There is a central swimming pool for the three hotels located between the Courtyard and the Marriott. As other reviewers have noted, you can catch a shuttle from the hotel to the cruise terminal for about ten dollars per person. At the conclusion of our cruise we were unable to get a shuttle back to the hotel from the terminal and wound up flagging down a taxi. As far as the free breakfast goes, it was very basic but did the job. The buffet items included scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, toast, bagels, muffins, cereal, coffee, milk, juice, and yogurt. We went early before they ran out of anything. The neighboring Marriott has an upscale restaurant with great seafood dishes, the Courtyard had a Champions Sports Bar, and there is a great Cuban coffee shop with very reasonable prices about one block away.

Free airport shuttle ran frequently, gated parking was 15 $ a day. Had dinner at \"Cane Fire Grill\" which is located in the Marriott right opposite the hotel and it was fine. Now the ***major*** downpoint: breakfast! This hotel caters to large pre- and post-cruise groups, so one should think, they should be able to handle high breakfast traffic - they are not! When we came down on New Year's morning at 09:30 a. m. (as everybody else did, because - not surprisingly - everybody wants to sleep as long as possible that morning), the buffet was empty: no decaf, no mugs, no china, no silverware, no youghurt, no pastries - nothing! And that stayed this way until the only breakfast attendant around (a young girl who ran front desk otherwise), mercilessly shut the doors to the buffet area at precisely 10:00 a. m. OK, we thought, special day, I will work out better the following days: it did not. Decent restocking never took place or they brainlessly restocked items which were still available, while other \"sold out\" items were not restocked for ages. The whole breakfast area was dirty, tables were not cleared or cleaned - this breakfast ruins the whole impression of the otherwise great hotel. At present, I am staying at Hyatt Summerfield Suites Miami Airport and they know how to run a breakfast buffet: 2-3 breakfast attendents around, instant restocking and cleaning.

Over our past few trips we have learned one important thing: If you are willing to stay near the airport, you will get an infinitely better hotel than on the beach. This was re-enforced when we stayed a week at the Residence Inn by Marriott Miami Airport South. For a $57/night Priceline bid and $15 per day parking we were able to get a large, comfortable room with free internet, a kitchenette, free hot breakfast, and free manager's reception on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evening. By comparison, most of your bottom rate hotels on North Miami Beach (far from the action of South Beach) will charge you at least $80/night before parking with no free food. The room is of worse quality as well. This hotel was a very pleasant surprise. Since we split our time between the beach and family & friends near the University of Miami campus it is the perfect location to avoid traffic on I-95/US-1 as well. We were very pleased with our stay and would definitely return. I even normally think it should be illegal to charge for parking anywhere on the planet, but when you factor in the free breakfast and managers reception (with booze!) it more than makes up for it. The breakfast is even of excellent quality with scrambled eggs, waffles, sausage, oatmeal, fresh fruit, cereal, and many more options.

This property is very convenient if you are visiting someone at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. The hospital is a short 10-15 min drive depending on route and traffic. Traffic in this part of Miami was never bad - unless you get caught by an opening draw bridge! My single complaint occurred upon check out. My relative and I wanted to split the bill between us so we asked the front desk and they indicated it wouldn't be a problem and rung it up right there. Later that day my wife called asking why Marriott charged $1100 to our cc? Turns out Marriott didn't do as they said they wood. The charge issue is still open, no resolution yet.

It was initially a bit confusing as there didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any specific bus stop, and lots of other airport buses were whizzing past. (The shuttle also serves the Marriott and Fairfield Inn hotels on the same site as the Courtyard) Flagging the bus down the second time it came around did the trick! The reception/lounge area was bright and spacious with a modern Mediterranean feel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c warm earthy tones and contemporary design. The reception staff were young and professional - check in/out were both dealt with efficiently. I booked a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom suite. As you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from a quality American hotel, the bedrooms were spacious with large comfortable beds, and well equipped \u00e2\u20ac\u201c free wireless internet and a widescreen TV in each of the bed rooms, plus the lounge area too!

The bathrooms were also spacious, with good shower pressure and plenty of hot water. We were on the ground floor, with a view of the car park. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue given the length of time we were staying, and the room was well sound proofed and had effective black out curtains. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a restaurant in the hotel but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Starbucks and a couple of restaurants in the Marriott hotel on the same campus.

Of the three hotels, the Residence Inn is farthest from the highway, which I liked. Despite being close to the airport (5 minutes by shuttle) I was not bothered by noise from flights, which was a relief and a little bit of a surprise considering the proximity. RI properties have a free get together some weeknights. The food was pretty dismal when I was there (badly made chili, likely from a can and an anemic salad), but it was gratis. My room was standard issue Residence Inn. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. It was nice having the other Marriotts so close-by as I drank in the sports bar in the CY and ate dinner in the M. The staff at the CY bar an din the RI hotel were fairly indifferent to customers. It was a little surprising and is an area for definite improvement. That being said, I would stay here again,primarily because it was so easy to get to the airport and also get to Miami Beach cheaply. From the hotel you can ride to the airport every 30 minutes and then catch the 150 bus on the hour and half-hour. Given that the hotel has the same schedule, this gives you 10 or 15 minutes to get from the airport arrivals to the bus station in the airport (take escalator down from the E concourse, cross over traffic, and locate bus station on other side).

This is a very new (2009) property located in a \"campus-like\" environment, along with a Marriott Hotel and a Marriott Courtyard. The property is about 1.5 miles south of the MIA entrance. A nearby Fairfield Inn & Suites is visible nearby, but is not within this campus. The grounds are well maintained. There is a large swimming pool serving all three properties, as well as a fully equipped central workout facility. The workout facility rivals most membership health/gym clubs I've encountered. There is also a mini workout facility located on the ground floor of the Residence Inn. The recent construction activity is nearing completion, with little sign of any major activity remaining to be performed. The main workout center is now built-out and should satisfy most everyone. The staff here is friendly, competent and welcoming. There are three (3) staff members who have the first name of LaToya. One works in housekeeping and the other two work at the Front Desk. The two LaToyas working at the Front Desk are an absolute delight in their attitude and customer service skills. Other Front Desk staff were also helpful and friendly. Our accommodations were spacious and clean. Housekeeping loaded the dishwasher each morning and when we returned to the room we were ready to again use the plates and utensils. The room had a large flat screen TV on a turntable, making the TV viewable from either the sitting area or the bed. There is a work desk in the room with a phone and internet connection. There is also a two-chair dining table. The bed was up to the usual high standards we've come to expect at Marriott properties, and included a selection of bed pillows that should prove adequate for nearly everyone. During our stay, we visited Champions, the sports bar and watched football games and enjoyed our adult beverages and snacks. The service here was very good. There is also a Starbucks located within the campus, as well as a restaurant, in the other hotel buildings. At the conclusion of our cruise, we again used the Residence Inn for a one-night stay before flying out of Miami the next morning. There is a frequent, free shuttle to and from the airport. The first shuttle to the airport is at 5 a.m. If your have a very early flight a taxi to the airport terminals runs about $8.00 in fares. Keep in mind, as the location of this property states, it is the Residence Inn, AIRPORT South. As such, you WILL hear airplanes taking off from MIA into the night and starting early in the morning. While the property seems well soundproofed, and the windows are dual-glazed, there is little that can be done to silence the noise of aircraft completely. Take that into consideration if you decide to stay here. We did not find the aircraft noise to be a major problem during our time here. The Marriott campus is located on the Miami Transit bus line which you can take into the airport if you wish. At the airport, there is a bus waiting and transfer facility. You can transfer to another bus and ride either into downtown Miami or to South Beach. One point to keep in mind with the Miami bus system is, after Oct. 2009, they no longer issue on-board transfers. Each time you board a bus, the fare is $2.00 for adults, so if your travels take you onto more than one bus, keep this in mind. If you plan to use the Miami bus system you can purchase an \"Easy Pass\" (one for each traveler) through the Miami transit on-line web site and load it with any amount you choose. Then, you can transfer from one bus to another without paying the $2.00 each time. You should try to purchase your Easy Pass on-line before arriving in Miami if possible. We did not purchase an Easy Pass before arriving in Miami and, at this point in time (Nov. 2009), the locations to purchase them are not convenient. While you would think there would be an Easy Pass vending machine at the Airport bus terminal, you would be sorely disappointed. The Easy Pass program seems to have been implemented before sufficient vending machines and sales locations are in place. There is a Hertz Rental Car desk (in the Marriott Hotel) where you can rent a car during your stay. You should also be able to drop off the car at other LOCAL Hertz locations without drop off charges, but ask about this before renting. The entire Marriott campus charges $12.00 per day for parking, so if you have a vehicle, or rent a car, be prepared to pay for each 24-hour parking period.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ljubljana", "Title": "\u201cVAU\u201d", "Author": "Zdenka37", "ReviewID": "UR49428805", "Content": "The best hotel on our trip.
