Ideally located next to the Metro, but food options are not as comprehensive. Customer service is warm and helpful *by Parisian standards*. On my first night I did not have a room available so they reaccomodated me into another hotel. Not very nice, unfortunately but was upgraded to the Superior room for the remainder of my stay. There are a couple of niggles, apparently the air conditioner stops working when one opens the window and then never worked again for the rest of my stay. The hotel did not replenish my free minibar and then charged me when I asked for a refill. And the shower in my room does this weird thing where it's intensely hot for 5 seconds and then warm for a good 30 seconds and then crazily hot again for 5. All in all, very all over the map, but probably the best hotel I've stayed in in Paris for the price in a while to be very honest.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York, USA", "Title": "\u201cToo average\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR124780922", "Content": "Although the front desk help were very helpful for Parisian standards and the breakfast was good for the price, the hotel itself wasn't what I expected from Accord at this price range.

So exactly what I would hope to (but rarely do) find - all at a reasonable price.

I didn't know much about Paris but seemed like it was near some sites like the Notre Dame and other site seeing destinations. Not knowing anything about the subways, buses and not having any Euros on us after a redeye flight, we got off at the Chatelet Les Halles stop after taking the train from the airport. And boy, it was quite a long walk from there to the hotel. We checked with Ernesto, from the hotel staff, who was very friendly and initially helpful except for one minor but important error. When I asked if the breakfast was complimentary, his answer was \"yes, complimentary breakfast\". This came back to haunt us on check out. The hotel was very clean, modern with a recent renovation we read about on Tripadvisor. The room was a bit small but within the norm for Europe. Quiet stay with minimal street noise. Breakfast served each morning was delicious with good service, but expensive (16 euro/ person) and NOT complimentary. Our main gripe with the hotel is that they charged us for the stay even though it was pre-paid thru travelocity. Hopefully just an error.

After going back to the front desk, I finally made it to my double bed room, extremely small, but at least, unoccupied. The receptionist did apologise 'as he was new to his role'. The wireless did not work properly and I had no desk to sit at, just some sort of small table from which I could work on sat on the bed, in a rather uncomfortable position. The bathroom was clean.

Don't really want to tell everyone about the hotel because we don't want it to become so popular that we can't get a room next time!
