The hotel feels like a large gracious apartment from a bygone era. It is utterly charming- the decor is authentic down to the aged telephone and antiques throughout (although thankfully the bathroom was modern, if a bit small). One can feel the history all around and I was reminded of childhood trips to a country manor. The pension is situated up 2 flights of stairs in a townhouse (a word of warning to those unable to manage the steps- there is an elevator too, accessed through a side door and with a key- might be a good idea to inquire before arrival!) Our room (number 22) was huge, and beautifully decorated with original furniture and fittings from Art Nouveau to 1950's. Obviously the furniture showed its age somewhat, but not in a negative way. The ceilings must have been at least 4 metres high. As already mentioned the bathroom was very small, but adequate. A hairdryer was found for us and a needle and thread for a quick repair-job. The beds were very comfortable and the towels were plentiful and changed daily. The staff were extremely nice and left us completely in peace. We were always last to leave the breakfast room, but they still refilled things even after breakfast time and never made us feel we should be moving on. The quality of the breakfast and coffee was also good. Water and beer can be taken from a fridge in the hallway at any time for a moderate price. The location is excellent, it could hardly be more central- yet Fasanen Str so quiet that we slept with open windows without being unduly bothered by street noise. Also the value for money was unbeatable, and included breakfast, wifi and taxes . We really enjoyed our stay and would certainly go back, and I do recommend it. However, be aware that it is not a standardised Hotel \u00e0 la Hilton or similar, and has quirks and personality. Don't book if you want room service at 4am and a bellboy and flatscreen-TV (in fact there are no televisions at all in the hotel!).

One arrives on the ground floor into a grubby smelly lobby,poorly lit to be faced with a vicious flight of grubby marble stairs partly coverd by worn and tatty linoleum.At the top of this flight of stairs there is an ancient lift that one needs a key for and as there is often no staff present there is no way of getting this key.The alternative is yet another flight of even more dimly lit wooden stars coverd by a worn ,dirty cord carpet with dangerous holes in it which could catch a heel and cause a serious fall. The entrace door to the hotel on the second floor is grubby and a stale smell pervades. On entry to the hotel through a scruffy unpolished door there is a long narrow hallway with a grubby carpet covered over by various assorted mats and runners. My room which had a sink and free standing shower cubicle in it had no toilet. Under the shower cubicle was a patch of unevenly cut grubby linoleum laid on top of a badly worn and long neglected parquet floor.The walls were covered by wall paper, I would estimate about 30 /40 years old and not the best then! Skirting boards all round the room were literally filthy with built up varnish and possibly polish from some past attempt at housekeeping and considerable amounts of dust in corners.Woodwork was all cream ,chipped and dirty especially the window.The curtains,unlined, and of the variety found at jumble sales many years ago, hung from old ,noisy and sticky curtain rails and a ghastly pelmet. A standard lamp with a dirty shade with its trim hanging off did little to pierce the gloom. Two arm chairs in grubby pink draylon with bits of the upholstery hanging off and a selection of non matching dark and badly treated furniture completed the image. Bedding was clean and of white cotton but was never changed in 9 nights! Towels ,white, and replaced daily were a little tired but adequate. Apart from liquid soap at the sink no complimentary toiletries provided or even a box of tissues. As one had to cross the hall to get to a toilet it might have been nice to have a robe provided but this would be too much to expect from this establishment. No TV /radio/clock or free internet connection. As floors creaked and noise insulation is poor one is aware of,and woken up at all hours by ,other guests coming and going noise from adjacent rooms and the office telephone ringing. Breakfast was unimaginative and basic with no fresh fruit juice and no hot food apart from boiled eggs -someimes soft sometimes hard at luke warm temperature. An indescribable jug of brown luke warm liquid is called coffee. A tatty display about the silent movie actress Asta Neilsen does nothing to justify this establishment trading on this tenuous claim to fame. Incidentaly she only lived in part of the current hotel and apparently only for about 18 months in the 1930s. It feels as if the whole place has received little care and attention since then. There is quaint, bijou ,characterful and well kept , loved and polished and then there is tired,unloved and frankly knackered and this excuse of a hotel falls into the latter category. It is obvious that the place is busy with good occupancy rates and that much is being taken out by the owners but that very little has been put back in for a very long time.Never again!", "Date": "March 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWill be back again soon to Pension Funk,\u201d", "Author": "maddogs3", "ReviewID": "UR13531639", "Content": "Myself, my husband (both mid 40's) and my friends (both mid 40's) and the husband on crutches due to a broken ankle were thrilled witht he location.

When we arrived dead-tired from our flight from the US (my sister travelled from California & I from New York) our room was not available. We had to climb two flights with our luggage. We were given a small room with two beds and private bath. The stall shower was the size of a broom closet -- not designed for the stout or for anyone desiring to was his/her feet. After check-in, we were given a key for the elevator which would have been useful for getting our luggage up to the vestibule. There are no arrangements for getting the key from the street level and their is no intercom to signal for help. Breakfast was very good and staff very accomodating and friendly. Beds fairly comfortable -- down comforters and pillows. No TV, radio, etc. Everything is neat and clean. After two days, we were given a different room in another wing of the pension. This room was an improvement, not in size but because it had a separate WC and shower arrangement. We arrived back after a day of sightseeing and dinner at 10:45 PM one night to discover that the entire section where I second room was was plunged into darkness. I had a flashlight with me -- we were able to find our way back to the main vestibule and copy down emergency numbers. We were able to call these numbers and leave messages only. We made five calls and left as many messages. Finally, after more than an hour of frustration, we got through to a live human being. We went to sleep and in the middle of the morning, the ceiling light came on. The other lights in the room were repaired the next day. This old pension (1895) came highly recommended. I will not stay there the next time I go to Berlin, but will find another place in the same great location (near the KuDamm, the Bristol Kempinski Hotel, Ulandstrasse U-Bahn & bus stop).", "Date": "February 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cwarning for older travellers\u201d", "Author": "travelling_granny", "ReviewID": "UR5979314", "Content": "This is a charming place, though a bit primitive. Older travellers or those who cannot walk 2 flights of stairs should go elsewhere. Also, there is no one at the switchboard from about 8:30 PM to 8 AM local time. Service is extremely limited. Definitely not for business travellers either. I took a taxi at 6:30 AM to the airport from the hotel, and the driver had to walk upstairs to get my suitcase downstairs for me, as there is no one in attendance at that time. I would recommend it for younger travellers who seek an authentic 1920s Berlin atmosphere. The rate is reasonable and there is a good breakfast included in the price.
