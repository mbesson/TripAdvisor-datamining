As the other reviewers have commented, the property is well-appointed, clean, and elegant. The hospitality of the owner is terrific. My two children slept on the pull-out sofa bed, and found it perfectly comfortable. The kitchen is well-equipped with everything you could need for a short stay (and then some). The bathroom has a Jacuzzi shower (but our room had no bath tub, if that matters to anyone). The location is perfect, and we walked almost everywhere. It's close to a bus stop, if you want to ride up to Fiesole (which you should by the way) for a great view of the city. The owner was helpful in every way. As an added bonus, Ernesto -- the owner's black cat -- also showed a great deal of hospitality to my children. We departed early morning for a drive to Siena, and the owner gave us two pieces of delicious cake for the children. What service!

The location, right across the street from the Accademia Museum (home of David), was ideal -- not too crammed with tourists, but not too far away from the sights. We walked up a few flights of stairs to a quiet and gorgeous apartment (the San Marco) with dramatic, high ceilings, luxurious draperies and colorful frescoes on the ceiling. The bathroom was pristine and modern with a great shower -- no small thing in Europe! Best of all, perhaps, was our attentive and friendly hostess Francesca -- she was so helpful and lovely.

Francesca, who looked after us was lovely and even organised tickets for us to see David and to enter the Uffizi Gallery.

My husband and I spent 4 nights at the Palazzo Alfani. All I have to say is that 4 nights was not long enough! This little apartment residence, located directly across from the Accademia, is an absolute gem. There is no lobby, no concierge, no bell boys...which in my opinion adds even more to it's charm. What you will find is a warm, inviting apartment, lovingly run by Francesca and the Alfani family who will look after your every need without hesitation and with a smile to boot!The Alfani has an amazing location...directly across the Accademia and an approx 10 - 15 min walk to the Duomo, Piazza della Republica, etc. It is the perfect location to explore. There are also several restaurants in the area. Francesca has some of the most amazing recommendations...I highly recommend you try one or all of them. Our favourite was the 'Accademia' Enoteca which was just around the corner from the apartment. The apartments are very well appointed. We stayed in the Santa Maria Novella suite which overlooked Via Ricasoli and the entrance to the Accademia. The line for the Accademia is long and starts early...if you are sensitive to noise, recommend a room that faces the inside courtyard garden. We actually did not mind the noise from the street...it added charm and actually forced us to wake up early to head out and explore.Each apartment has its own kitchenette (equiped with everything you need) as well as a lovely sitting and eating area. The rooms are immaculate! Not to mention the high ceilings and impressive decoration! There is a small grocery store only a few steps away where you can get everything you need...including wine!What else can I say? The Palazzo Alfani is an incredible find in amazing Firenze. If you are looking for accommodation that is a little more under the tourist radar than a typical hotel...look no further. The apartments at the Palazzo Alfani will make you feel like your home away from home...and Francesca will go out of her way to help with anything. She is amazing!Francesca...Thank you so much for making our stay with you our most memorable in Italia. We look forward to staying with you again soon...and I look forward to recommending your residence to all my clients! John and Tricia...your friends in Canada.Oh...and if you are looking for something off the beaten path to do while in Firenze...I highly recommend the 1-day Bike Tuscany tour with ArtViva tours...it was fantastic and the highlight of our trip (aside from the Palazzo Alfani of course)...", "Date": "Jun 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR902736795", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "born2travel3"}, {"Content": "Apartment Living on Vacation Rather than staying at a hotel on my last trip to Florence, Italy, I decided to rent an apartment. Palazzo Alfani al David is so conveniently located and is literally right across the street from the Academia and around the corner from Piazza San Marco. My expectations of the apartment were throughly exceeded. It was bright, airy, very spacious, immaculately clean, very nicely furnished and I immediately felt at home. Huge windows in the living room/dining room combination opened to a beautiful courtyard, as did the bedroom window. The bathroom was very large with all modern plumbing and a fabulous shower. The kitchen was furnished with a refrigerator, stove, microwave, coffee maker and coffee! There was a large flat screen TV and very high speed internet access that simply required being plugged into my laptop. Florence is such a fabulous city that you want to walk it over and over again....it is truly a walking city. It was wonderful to return home to my apartment for an afternoon rest after all my walking each day. And then out to dinner. I even had two occasions when I had a delicious meal that I couldn't finish and I took home a doggie bag that I was able to heat in the microwave another day!

We stayed at the Palazzo Alfani, a small family run establishment, with a series of self-contained apartments.The Alfani family, who run it, were absolutely brilliant, they were so kind, and would go out of their way to be helpful and left no stone unturned. We can\u9225\u6a9b praise them highly enough and we would definitely recommend this as a place to stay.The location is second to none, right opposite the Accademia Gallery with the Duomo at the end of the road, which sadly we didn't have time to queue for, but was stunning and surreal to look at, and it\u9225\u6a9a no more than a 10 minute walk to the Santa Novella station. The rooms are recently refurbished (we were lucky enough to be their first-ever guests), they are traditional, yet modern, clean and bright with well-equipped kitchens. However, we did have a room overlooking the Accademia Gallery (which houses Michaelangelo's 'David') and it does get a little noisy at around 8am with queues of people. Not a problem for us, but if you prefer something a bit quieter just request an apartment overlooking the pretty garden.If you do want to go to the Accademia Gallery, it's advisable to get there no later than 8am, otherwise you could end up queuing round the block. Alternatively, you can always queue in the morning and get tickets for later in the day, which we found useful. Be warned, it is closed on a Monday. Tickets are around 9 Euros.We also visited the Boboli Gardens, which were gorgeous, they had sculptures and the higher you go the better the views of Florence are. We got some lovely photos. Queues are long, but they go down quite quickly, so it's worth waiting. Tickets were 6 Euros and included in that you get entry to some of the Museums on the site, which consisted of costumes, pottery, paintings, and sculptures.The Ponte Vecchio was well worth visiting too, it had lovely picturesque views and to get there from the town centre you encounter a quaint little street with more jewellery shops than you can shake a stick at! Also nearby (a block west of Piazza Sante Croce), there is a fab little ice cream shop called 'Vivoli', it's difficult to find, but worth it when you get there! They have so many unusual flavours and each one we tried was delicious.Depending on what sort of shopping you like we were amazed with the markets, they were all willing to barter and you can get some real bargains, such as beautifully soft leather bags, pashmenas, t-shirts and costume jewellery. However, the sales people can be a bit overbearing. If you were looking to go to a shopping outlet, we do not recommend Barberino, even though it is only a 30 minute bus journey, we were unimpressed. The items were hardly discounted and the shops were rather understocked. For us it was a wasted afternoon.On the whole Florence was one of the best short breaks we have been on, and we\u9225\u6a9de been on quite a few now. We recommend the Palazzo Alfani apartments with no hesitation. In fact, we're hoping to stay there again later this year, but this time we'll certainly join that queue for the Duomo!", "Date": "May 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR333154821", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JLorettaB"}, {"Content": "Un autentico Lujazo, ya que se...   showReview(16726555, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR945127678", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "El apartamento ha sido mucho...   showReview(16724507, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR790395777", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Nochevieja en Palazzo Alfani       Habitaci\u8d38n 2, apto.
