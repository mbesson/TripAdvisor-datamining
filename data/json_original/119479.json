It was unnerving. Things did get better when the day-shift crew came in and the usual shiny, happy attitude returned, but by then the damage was done. By then the once charming hotel was exposed as an over-priced, over-hyped motel on Fairfax. At least \"Tart\" the attached restaurant is as good as ever.

This is so different from a chain hotel, it doesn't make sense to try to compare it to one. If you want a sterile, cookie cutter, \"same as I stayed at in.....\", you will be disappointed. If you want unique, friendly and trendy, this is the place to stay. We were attending the 2011 Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival at the near by, New Beverly Cinema and wanted to stay in the area at a boutique hotel. We were not disappointed. The Farmer's Daughter Hotel appears to have been designed as a quintessential \"motor court\" in the 50's or 60's. It has been redesigned and they have done an amazing job of working with in the constraints of the original structure. We stayed in room 101, located in a quiet corner of the property. I don't know what the other rooms look like so this is unique to 101. The room is decorated with copper counter tops and accents throughout the room and includes a subtle continuation of the farm theme in the bedding and wall mural. The bedding was very comfortable. The faucet was style like an old fashioned sink pump. The shower was simple but included an adjustable rain style head and there was plenty of hot water. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. They made every attempt to accommodate us as we dealt with the logistics of visitors. They helped us find a great place to eat - \"Animal\" - just up the street. It didn't matter if it was midnight or 8 am, there was always a smile and helpful attitude. Over all I cannot say enough about the facility and staff.

It is, like many similar boutique hotels in other cities (Ace, Clarendon, Rumor, etc), a property that was previously less reputable and not constructed as a modern hotel, but which has been retrofitted and renovated in order to serve a class of customers who don't mind trading off some big hotel amenities in order to get a more interesting and distinctive hotel experience. Like these similar boutique hotels, Farmer's Daughter can't entirely hide its flaws beneath good design, but overall the experience usually outweighs the drawbacks. There are two very appealing aspects of the Farmer's Daughter. One is its concept and branding. The entire place is decorated using a farmhouse theme. Think lots of yellow and blue, including plaid/gingham curtains, denim bedspreads, imitation whitewashed plank flooring, large beds, and lots of whimsical paintings of animals and farm life decorating the rooms. There are, of course, many of the usual expected amenities, from flat screen TVs with cable to in-room safes and refrigerators, to an in-house restaurant (TART) that also provides room service. All of these are coordinated with the Farmer's Daughter iconic imagery. You can even buy the official t-shirt (\"Do It At The Daughter\") at the front desk. But you can also get free cookies and lemonade at the front desk, so it's not just a gift shop. The second appealing aspect of the Farmer's Daughter is its location right in the middle of everything interesting in West Hollywood. If you're trying to get on a CBS game show, the studio is across the street. LACMA and the Petersen Automotive Museum are very close. So is the farmer's market, and a variety of local eateries, some of which are famous (Canter's 24-hour deli). You can see the Hollywood sign from the sidewalk, and you can reach most places from Beverly Hills to Pasadena in a reasonable amount of time by car. Of course, parking stinks. So if you're driving into the Farmer's Daughter, either take advantage of the valet parking (currently about $18/day), or get familiar with the neighborhood and try to find street parking (but beware of street-sweeping exclusions!). Given these two appealing aspects of the Farmer's Daughter, there are probably good reasons to overlook some of its less appealing elements. But not everyone will be able to do this, so I should point out two things that might eliminate the Farmer's Daughter as an option for your next trip. One is that, like every other retrofitted boutique hotel I've ever stayed in, the Farmer's Daughter is loud. Part of this is that LA is loud, especially with traffic noise and external construction. But a big part of it is basically that Farmer's Daughter has thin walls and a lot of activity that causes noise, whether it is A/C units kicking on and off, cleaning machines powering up, or construction noise (e.g. jackhammers in the pool at 9am). It is sometimes difficult to sleep through the night, and light sleepers will not enjoy their Farmer's Daughter experience. The main building is quieter, but this is relative. It is never actually quiet. The other thing that might put off travelers is that the overall condition of the property feels less well-maintained and polished than a large hotel. You're not always sure that the toilet will work (though it does), and large parts of the bathroom seem to be held together with paint. I did not have any problems with maintenance issues, and everything worked completely fine. However, if you are expecting the same level of fit and finish as the W or Four Seasons, you may find the Farmer's Daughter a bit shabby. Ultimately the good far outweighs the bad at Farmer's Daughter, and if you are looking for a charming and unique boutique hotel in a great location, this is about as good as it gets. Light sleepers should look elsewhere, and you shouldn't expect that the physical property will be as perfect as the branding and identity materials. But if you want to remember your stay in Los Angeles, check it out. You'll probably be glad that you did.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBest location in LA.

The hotel's first asset is its location in West Hollywood. This being LA, one of course has to drive to many places and the hotel conveniently sits in the centre of the city, within short driving distance to Hollywood, Sunset, Melrose or Beverly Hills; and reasonable distance to Venice, Santa Monica or Downtown. What is more unusual is to be, like Farmer's Daughter, within walking distance of some major attractions: the Farmer's Market just accross the street is a large and sheltered food court with all possible options for casual dining, where one can not only grab a bite but also hang around and relax; the Grove district, also across the street, is a large outdoor mall, complete with fashion shops, Apple store, Nordstrom, Barne's & Noble's and a multiplex. These remain lively day and night, and seem to be drawing families and people from all age and social groups. This translates into a nice feeling of local life, remote from the tourist trap that is Hollywood Boulevard. The streets surrounding the hotel host a variety of thrift stores, lifestyle and health shops. Three blocks further down is Los Angeles County Museum, which hosts permanent collections as well as world-class exhibitions - the one during our stay was featuring the works of Tim Burton. The hotel appears to be a renovated motel, extending on both sides of a parking lot. It oozes charm, in a falsely rustic but actually very cool style. The ambience of the lobby and the common areas made us feel at home from the start. Nice touches in the room decoration also differentiate nicely from standard hotel chains. The rooms are not huge by US standards, but decent in size. We found no fault with the clean bathrooms, constant hot water, and free broadband wifi. One minor uncool detail: drinking water is provided at a charge in the rooms, free would be nicer. To complement the hotel amenities: a fine restaurant called Tart, with a pleasant open courtyard; a swimming pool too small to be useful: and obligatory valet parking, not strictly necessary given the layout of the hotel, but always quick and friendly. The hotel rate of about US$250 per night in mid-summer appears to be at a moderate premium compared with other hotels in the same category in LA, which we found justified by the location and style of the place. Our big disappointment lied not in the hotel, but in the reservation services offered by Hotels.com. The website confirmed to us a rate of US$180, no condition. We found out upon check-in that this was predicated on membership of AARP (American Association of Retired Persons - not a US citizen, never heard about it before). According to the staff at reception, \"not the first time that Hotels.com uses AARP codes to secure a preferred rate and forgets to inform its client about it\"; we only got the hotel's side of the story. It was late, the hotel offered to maintain that rate for one night, and revert to US$250 thereafter. We have tried to contact Hotels.com to obtain an explanation and possibly a refund: first phone call unsuccessful after an hour's wait; second phone call taken after half an hour's wait by an employee who knew nothing about rates; two detailed emails to Hotels.com have remained unanswered after 3 weeks. I have been a regular user of Hotels.com services for years; that will cease now.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLaid back, comfortable and friendly environment.\u201d", "Author": "Jess288", "ReviewID": "UR116400557", "Content": "I loved the farm style d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the hotel.

During the mid-afternoon (Friday), we were about 20 to 30 minutes from the airport rental car locations in moderate traffic. The Wednesday morning (8:30) commute took maybe 10 minutes longer to get back to the rental car place. Let's start with the room. It was very clean, and we found the room decor kind of charming. They're not very big rooms, but we didn't stay in the room very long so we didn't mind it. The coolest thing - and mind you this may seem silly - I noticed was the bathroom sink fixture. It was made like a little outside pump you might find on a farm. Coming from Wisconsin, we still thought it was unique. The beds were on the firm side and the air conditioning unit worked well. We slept well every night except one, which brings me to my next point. The walls are a little thin if you're unfortunate enough to get some noisy neighbors. We were awakened just after 2AM (presumably club closing time?) and the noise continued for about an hour - hollering and just loud voices in general. We didn't call the front desk so I'm not sure how they would have handled it. Once the noise subsided it was fairly quiet again. Another thing we noticed was that every night there was an emergency call as either fire trucks or an ambulance went past the hotel with sirens blaring. But again, you're in the heart of LA so it's to be expected. Their service was outstanding. The rooms were cleaned well with our only complaint being that we didn't get more soap bars. Luckily we had some other soap with us. Caramels on the folded down blankets every day when we returned were a nice touch. We also needed some toiletries and another pillow, and we had everything delivered within 10 minutes. The front desk people were the best I've ever met. Extremely friendly and very helpful. They seemed genuinely excited to see us and were interested in how they could assist us with our plans for our stay. Valets were always courteous and prompt. The one drawback of the hotel is that the valet charge is mandatory to park there (in their secure lot) and nets about $21/day after taxes. But in LA we quickly found that you pay for parking everywhere so you might as well get used to it. We didn't swim in their pool, but it looked a little small and didn't seem to be used by anyone. They offered ping pong tables too. The lobby offered warm and chewy chocolate chip cookies, fresh lemonade, and fresh potato chips every day. The best thing about the hotel was the location. It is near everything we wanted to see. CBS was across the street in case you want to see a taping of a show or go to The Price Is Right. I believe you need tickets at least a month in advance to get into that one though, and there was always a big line of people for the show. One thing I found was that there are shows from other networks filmed at CBS as well, so if you're interested take the time to walk over to one of the studio gates and ask what's being taped that day. Oftentimes you can get tickets for a same day show, depending upon it's popularity. We went to The Grove. It's nice, but a little ritzy for us. However, their parking structure is great for viewing the city. Take the elevator to the top floor and walk out there to see the city in every direction. Very nice photo op up there. No cost to enter on foot either. We found The Farmer's Market to be a good place for lunch as it offered many different choices as well as the typical fresh fruit, nuts, etc. you might find. The more we went over there, the more we liked it. And we stayed at the hotel for five days, so we ended up visiting it at least four times. Hollywood Blvd is only 10 to 15 minutes away, which is where the Walk of Fame and Grauman's Chinese Theater can be found. Park in the parking garage and go from there for easy access. The Sunset Strip and Melrose were even closer. Santa Monica Pier was about 20 minutes in late morning traffic. Venice not far from there. Malibu maybe 20 minutes from Santa Monica on the Pacific Coast Hwy. Suggest doing them all in one day to save time and miles. Universal was less than 10 minutes. Pink's Hot Dogs maybe 5 to 7 minutes. In all, our trip to LA was fantastic and it all started with the location of this hotel. It was so easy to get everywhere and quick too. We only had to travel the freeway a couple of times, and if you choose the non-rush hour traffic it goes quickly. The one thing I will mention is that Disney is 45 minutes away with little traffic, so if you're trip is centered around Disney you may want to stay closer to that attraction. I hope this helps.

(2) Room service didn't tend to make it around to our room until very late in the day - which is fine for the days were out and about, but one day we returned to the room after lunch to just relax, and realized it hadn't been cleaned yet so felt like we needed to leave again, so they could get to it. However, we didn't bring it to the front desk's attn, so if this is something that was a big deal to you, I'm sure they could accommodate. (3) I was not a fan of having to valet park every time we were in/out. I knew about this ahead of time, but having to pay to valet + tip every time you get your car isn't ideal. Plus, the attendant would sometimes be MIA and we would have to wait awhile, then wander around the lot, looking for him.

We loved the cookies, spiced cider, chips and lemonade all available for free in the lobby. The location was very convenient to everywhere we needed to go. The bus trip to Hollywood Boulevard was only about 10 minutes. On this trip we stayed in several hotels but Farmers Daughter was by far my favourite. There is really nothing at all negative I can say about our stay.

The only complaint I have is that the bathroom tub could have been cleaner. There was hair in the tub. Also they provided no bath soap just face. Location: It was a short fare of about $15.00 to go to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The reason on why you would stay here is to attend a taping of The Price is Right. It is located right across the street. It is right across from the Farmers Market. (I had a good breakfast at Du-Pars) The Price is Right Seminar: The hotel provides a seminar hosted by Ted in the lobby. It starts around 10:30. It is quite informative on what to expect. He has a lot of knowledge. Even if you are a friend and true of The Price is Right, you will enjoy this. Other: The Staff went out of there way to make your stay more enjoyable. They printed my boarding pass when the lobby computer had trouble. Also they store your luggage when your across the street at The Price is Right. No problem calling a cab for you as well. Overall: The hotel is in a great location for The Price is Right. I did find it on the expensive side of $189 for the night. It was worth it just for the location alone.

She was knowledgable of the area and pretended to care about our vacation! We made it up to our room on the top floor (3rd floor) of the main bldg. which was suppose to be a bit noisier then the \"barn\" rooms because it was attached to the lobby however we had no noise complaints at all and for a friday night that is saying alot! Before our concert we ate at the hotel restaurant TART. We were greeted and seated right away. It is a tight squeeze inside but nice and there is outside seating in a private area between the hotel lobby and the restaurant doors. The staff was very pleasant with great customer service skills. Many people were working in order to keep everyone happy on a busy friday night! OK, this is where the mostly good service comes in... We were out until about 2am, after the concert we ate at a great little 24 hr restaurant/deli not too far from the hotel. On the way back to the hotel I called to make sure valet was still aval and of course it was 24hrs but was told to come to the lobby because the valet was also security at this time. We tried to use our room key to open the doors that connect the parking area to the lobby and they had bolt locked it. So we had to walk around front (which even though it is an ok neighborhood I would rather not do at 2am anywhere) it was a bit frustrating. Then when we got to the lobby the staff was very unpleasant (the lady working the desk and the security/valet) They were rude and some what bothered by us disturbing their naps (?) We then gave him our key and started to our room. We heard him rev the engine a few times in the process and squeal. We were able to view him parking the vehicle however and satisfied that he didn't hit anything along the way we decided to go to bed. There were plenty of comfy pillows and the bed was very comfortable too. The room was very cute and a good size.

I had one of the most unpleasant experiences that I have ever had in staying hotels anywhere around the world. On the whole the service was good. But in one day the manager - who seems to respond to posts on here - was able to destroy all of that good will. Having taken one payment off my card successfully, the manager wanted to immediately authorise a future transaction in advance but the card declined it - presumably as I was abroad (I had informed the bank) and the fact that the same place was running a second amount through within seconds. I reiterate, the first payment for several days stay WENT THROUGH NO PROBS. The manager didn't try to be helpful or understanding. Instead he was aggressive and deeply rude from the moment he first spoke to me. If I didn't have a thicker skin it would have been very embarrassing, as there were other people in the foyer. He said he would lock the room and wouldn't let me back in until I had a valid card (said cards were in my room and I couldn't call the bank as it was 1am in the UK). I wanted to get back into the room to use another card or my internet banking - he said he would only allow that if he came with me and sat with me whilst I accessed my account. As a professional person traveling with work I was made to feel like a child. I should add that I was staying for another week at this point. Once we managed to sort it, he asked if he could buy us a drink. Really quite a strange way to run a hotel - I didn't want a drink, just some common courtesy and politeness that should be run of the mill to a hotel guest. As this was going on we saw the same manager interact with another guest who had merely come to ask for a street map. And he was equally unpleasant and unhelpful in his dealing with this man, who in the end said 'You know what, forget it, I'll sort it out myself'. The final thing that really upset me with this hotel was the tiny bird cage in the foyer that housed two budgies. I really am no EcoWarrior type, but if there's something that upsets me it's seeing birds in a cage. Now that's my beef and it might not bother you. But what did concern me though was that one of the poor birds had a very long beak that had overgrown, it was clearly in distress - its partner was having to feed it. For God's sake, ignore my comments about the management but please take your sick bird to the vet! Regarding the rest of the place, it's a great location. The rest of the staff, bar one other, were really friendly. The manager should take lessons from the two girls on the desk. Tart serves some good fodder. BUT it is definitely overpriced. As other people say, the decor is tired. I can see what they're trying to achieve, but rather than being a pastiche design finished to a high standard, it's a redecorate done on the cheap with a marketing spin on the skimped finish. On a point of principal I wouldn't stay here. But also from an objective perspective I still wouldn't stay here - there are better boutique hotels in this price range.

The only thing to note will be that the Air conditioner was located on the main room and it took a while to cool the bedroom, but once it was cooled it was fine. Also with kids in the next room, you really have no privacy because the master room does not have a door lock and if you close the door you loose the AC.

Located directly across the street from the Farmer's Market, it's an old-school motel that's been remodeled in a kitschy, yet fun country style, with a touch of the newer, hip stainless steel touches of a more modern hotel. We stayed in one of their suites, which was a pretty large common room which had a futon of sorts in it that was comfortable for our four year-old to sleep on as well as a small kitchenette with refrigerator, sink, two burners and pots and pans to boot (strangely, though, no microwave). The bathroom was nice and clean with a cool rain shower head. The bedroom was pretty small with a very comfortable king bed (that I think had one of the memory foam mattress topper on it). We had a great night's sleep. Both rooms had large flat screen TVs and the one in the common room also had a DVD player that we used and looked great. Just outside of our room (#200) there was a cool open air patio area with some nice outdoor furniture and a coffee table. It's a nice place to relax at the end of the day. They have valet parking that they charge for (I think it was $11 a day) but it's very convenient. and it's easy getting in and out.

The 'farming' theme is quirky and charming, the rooms are very comfortable, there is free wifi (that was reliable and reasonably fast) and the staff are all very, very friendly and helpful. When I stayed there for the same visit last year the lady at the front desk very kindly rang Delta to chase the suitcase that they'd lost on my trip in while I slept, and made sure that they'd got it to the hotel by the following morning. On this visit, the staff in the restaurant didn't hassle us while we chatted and finished up our drinks long past closing time, even though they must really have wanted to close the place up and go home. The organisation whose meeting we were attending booked and paid for the rooms for us, and so I can't comment on or give a rating for value. The location is great if you have a car with you (it was about 15 minutes' drive to our destination close to Ivar and Sunset) and the nightlife at the Farmers' Market complex opposite is definitely a plus. No need to drive home, and therefore worry about alcohol intake during your evening! But if you don't have a car and you're visiting for Hollywood tourism, you're looking at some long walks or hefty taxi fares for your daytime activity. My only two negative reactions were that the hotel's restaurant not opening until 8am rules out having breakfast before leaving for a meeting at the start of the working day, and is a bit of a downside for business travellers. There are plenty of places to eat at the Farmers' Market opposite the hotel that are open early, but this is less convenient than just being able to get a quick breakfast inside you in the hotel restaurant and head off. Secondly, the valet parking charge levied in addition to the room charge (which is not optional: if you want to park at the hotel, you have to pay it) was substantial ($38 for the three nights I was there), and with public transport not really being an option for guests at this hotel, should have been incorporated into the room charge in my opinion.

When I needed to meet with some clients in the hotel, the hotel would not let us meet in their courtyard or lobby.

The last review I gave wasn't very good, but it was an honest review based on experience. We were going to the taping of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson across the street at CBS, so if nothing else, this hotel is convenient for that. It was just the one night stay and we had been at the Disneyland Hotel for the 3 nights prior, so I knew we would be arriving there early and requested that since I needed to be at CBS before 3:30 pm, would they please block a room for me if one becomes available by noon and the front desk graciously gave me a room ready to check into at 1:30 pm. I did purchase the package of room, breakfast for two at TART (the on site restaurant) and valet parking, which cost less than the price of the room, so if you decide to book this hotel, explore that option. The parking valet was very helpful when we arrived, even helped us with luggage and the front desk clerk was smiling and welcoming and of course, accommodating with that early check in. (Don't be afraid to ask for an earlier check in, they are happy to oblige IF the rooms are available) This time our room was nicer than the prior visit, both bedroom and bathroom.

Last time I was there, I was on the phone with tech help for 1/2 hour before I was finally connected, but when I got home, from all their reconfigurations, I couldn't connect to my home network.

It's a 20-minute walk to Museum Mile: the Los Angeles County Museum/Broad Gallery, the Folk Art Museum, and the Petersen Automotive Museum. I believe that the Hammer Museum is not much further away. Another 20-minute walk in the opposite direction puts you on Melrose Ave., home to the Groundlings Theater (improv home of Phil Hartman) and the Silent Movie Theater (the name says it all), and trendy--UGH--shopping. You can even get to the Beverly Center in about 20 minutes. In other words, fun hotel, absolutely unbeatable location.

The room was nice and a little rustic. Size of the room was reasonable and the bath/shower was fine along with television. Internet access was around $10 and they had the normal make your own coffee pot. We ate two meals at the restaurant (Tart) and they were a little expensive but very good and probably for the area, the price was reasonable. Of course the main reason to stay here is location, location, location. It is very convenient for attending the Price is Right show as you just go across the street at 6 a.m. to get your order of arrival tag, then at 8 get your ticket changed and 9 get in line for the 1 p.m. show. Since you'll be there all day, it's nice to have the hotel just across the street. For the Dancing with the Stars show, you have to walk to the other side of the CBS Studios but it would be the same as if you parked either at the Farmer's market or Grove since CBS has no public parking. The Farmer's Market has changed to basically a cacophony of fast food restaurants so you can virtually find anything you want to eat there. We ate twice at McGee's deli where the corn beef is just exceptional. In addition, the new Grove shopping center is a real upscale mall along the line of Disney's \"Downtown\" with a free tram which runs back and forth through the shopping area. I would go back to Farmer's Daughter hotel because of the convenience and would recommend that others wanting to attend shows at the CBS studios consider this place. If you've seen enough of LA and are there just for the shows, it's a great place as you can find everything you need by just walking.

We were greeted by all employees we encountered with a smile. Quick to respond to special requests.

Also no noise from the open sided restaurant on the first level. All rooms are non-smoking. There is a well maintained open-air lounge area outside the 2nd floor rooms where smoking is allowed.

Firstly, the Farmer's Suite is located right next to the elevator, so that people waiting to go up or down are waiting/talking/laughing/shouting right outside the front door of your room. Second, I echo the concern about no hand soap. Yes, there is a shower bar of soap, but nothing for the hands. The sink area was a little small. Third, there are no blackout shades in the room. I am not a heavy sleeper, and so I was awakened at 7:00 each morning by the sunshine. A nice touch if you want it, but I had fully intended to get some serious rest on this trip and the brightness of the room made that impossible. Fourth, the comfy couch that is advertised is anything but. It is small, with one large pillow, not at head level, and no armrests or throw pillows. It was very uncomfortable to watch TV on (at 7 AM after being awakened). Fifth, the TV and movie selection was quite subpar, and with great plasma TV's, one might expect a little better programming.

This is a converted Motel on a very busy street in Los Angeles but the location makes it a desirable location for contestants on \"The Price is Right\" as well as visitors who like the proximity to the Grove and Farmer's Market across Fairfax Avenue. There is a good deal of street noise and a busy alley behind the main building faces an auto repair shop that gets banging pretty early. Trash removal by a dumpster service also makes a racket at dawn a few days a week. We always pack ear plugs. Because there are communal areas on the ground floor pool patio and an open air second floor furnished lounge, it is best to request a room away from the action as people meet to chat and smoke and drink into the wee hours. Contestant meetings for the game shows are also held in the lobby in the evenings which makes it rather awkward to use the computer or congregate if you're not on a show. When we visited last year, the room rate was a little more than $100 a night and parking charges had been upped to $10 a night (mandatory valet parking is the only option). Use of wired internet was free in the room and the hotel offered no food service save a coffee pot en suite and a small fridge for anything you might bring to your room. This year, much to our dismay, the rates on the hotel website were closer to $200 a night. After shopping around awhile on the web, we found a $139 weeknight/$149 weekend rate and booked using expedia.com - a service requiring full payment for the entire stay in advance (yikes!). Upon arriving at the motel, we were impressed to see their new restaurant TART had opened and seemed busy with trendy Angelinos. Perhaps because there is increased traffic at the cafe, parking rates were hiked to $12 plus tax/tip and the small valet stand is very busy. Cars were backed up in front and into the driveway which made check in a little difficult. The desk had trouble locating our reservation and we feared there was a miscommunication with the prepaid discount rate or the booking site. The desk staff are always very pleasant and helpful and they worked it out. Once we got to our room, it was pretty much \"Same Time Next Year.\" Nothing changes year in and out in the rooms, but towels, rugs and furniture are definitely showing signs of wear and tear. The bathrooms are original to the motel and have gotten a little dingier with time. Our shower head was damaged and sprayed the entire bathroom each time we used it... These inconveniences are all minor when one is paying around $100 a night, but to be fair - this is not the quality of a $200 hotel room in Los Angeles. Times change and prices rise, but there is stiff competition for moderate hotels in the area and the Farmer's Daughter needs to update their facilities if they expect return guests. Free internet is gone as well. We logged on the first morning and found the service is $10 additional a day. There is a terminal available in the lobby for the same day rate or $4 an hour. We used a small safe in the room to stash valuables. We have never had a problem with articles left in our room. Our stay was just under a week's time in mid-July 2006. Housekeeping came in daily to change the well worn towels and make the bed, but did not change the linens. 2 small blue area rugs on the linoleum floor were never cleaned nor replaced. They were a little dusty all along. Chair cushions and slip covers were spotted and worn and the walls could have used a fresh coat of paint. To be fair, the Farmer's Daughter is quaint and funky and located in the midst of lots of shops, cafes, and the superTrendy Grove Mall. It is easy to walk around to pick up a quick meal at the Farmer's Market, to run to the drug store, or to check out the nearby shops and museums. Be aware that there is an active homeless population on Fairfax and walking alone late at night can be a little daunting. We have always enjoyed the Farmer's Daughter over the years but feel like the facilities could be spruced up as the rates are quickly increasing.

How many other \"motels\" have on-site restaurants? It IS annoying to pay for valet parking when for most rooms you have to walk through the parking lot anyway but I understand why they have to have it. The lot has fewer spaces than rooms and valet parkers can park cars closer together to save room. Also, they needed to have valet parking in order to get the liquor license for the restaurant. Also, in order to get into the parking lot, you have to go through a gate which closes off the rooms to the street. The valet parkers have some sort of remote that opens and closes the gate. Having the gate there makes me feel safer. We've stayed in the No Tell Room which has a king size bed, a wet bar and a mirror on ceiling. I liked it but found it was a little dark.

For the price, it is a great find. It's a cute, boutique-y hotel. The rooms are clean and very cute (the pictures online don't really do it justice).

We didn't have any problems and got the lowest price I could find by going direct. Many people seemed to have issues with the parking, but honestly ... EVERYWHERE in LA is valet parking. It's part of the culture there, and probably much more practical for the hotel. It was the cheapest valet parking anywhere around. Not much to really complain about there. And, the valet guys were great. The only downside is that check in was a 4 pm and we arrived very early. Luckily, we had somewhere to go, but some of the other guests were put out. Most places have an earlier check in or will let you check in sooner. We even let them know when we booked that we were arriving early and would appreciate getting checked in early and they still wouldn't let us in earlier than 3 pm.

The guys at the front desk were very nice, except for one who looked down his nose at me when I asked for a pass code to use the wireless Internet. The night before a pass had been given to me without extra charge (you need a new pass code every 24 hours) and when I asked the following night, he looked up my account and said that because I booked through Expedia, we couldn't have free access. I told him that it was included in my room rate and that I had had a free pass code the night before, but he wouldn't budge. I then went up to my room and had to call Expedia customer service to help me, and they confirmed that the Internet was included in my rate. I then had to go back to the guy and tell him what happened, but he said he'd have to check with someone else.

On checkout it hadn't been added to our bill, so we pointed this out and paid but when we got home we found they had taken the payment from our credit card again after we had left.

My boyfriend and I are both from LA, but just wanted a change of pace for our anniversary weekend. I used to live in the area and always remembered how they had revamped the hotel in recent years. I loved the name (its always stuck out in my head) and jumped on the opportunity to finally spend a night there! One of my favorites about this hotel is the location--across the street from the tasty delights at the Farmer's Market! It was a great treat to wake up and walk over to our favorite crepe stand in the market! It truly was a boutique experience! The hotel itself was clean, fairly modern, and completely cutesy. I was surprised to find a stereo in the room and found the houty-touty LA magazines that were provided great fun! The rocking recliner and portraits of cows and hens were a nice touch! Everything in the hotel is nicely branded as the Farmer's Daughter silhouette could be found everywhere--from the front of the hotel to the notepads in the rooms to the copper elevator interior. The weird part was our bathroom--it was completely plain white, non-descript and didn't have any farmer/country/color theme to it at all (unlike the rest of the hotel.) It seemed a bit unfinished, but it was clean otherwise. After reading reviews where people complained about noise, I was worried. But I have to say it was really really quiet when the windows and doors were closed. My one concern was the reservation system. I had asked for a room that would accommodate a dog when I made the reservation. The woman at the reservation service (a separate service from the actual hotel) told me that it was no problem and that I would just have to tell the front desk. Luckily I confirmed my reservation a few days later just to make sure everything would go smoothly. UNFORTUNATELY, the hotel told me that they only have two rooms that are pet friendly and those are generally booked up way in advance. I was then forced to find a sitter for my boyfriend's dog. It kind of put a kink in my original plans, but was my only gripe with the hotel. I imagine that the main issue is the disconnect with a generic reservation service and the hotel staff.

Check in was easy, the location is fantastic (we had meetings all over LA and it was central to everything), parking was reasonable ($10 a day with in&out), and the staff was nice. The kitschy theme of the hotel is fun and one they're really committed to -- I felt like we were in the next to-be-discovered hot spot in LA. One fascinating quirk of the hotel is Ted, front desk clerk and in-house \"The Price is Right!\" specialist. If you're around some night at 10:25 p.m., DO NOT MISS his treatise on how to get on TPIR as a contestant. It is a hoot. And it works! The show films at the CBS studios right across the street, so it's a convenient tourist activity for folks at the FD. I suspect they will soon have pilgrimages of people desperate to be contestants who will stay here... There are dozens of pictures in this lobby shrine of all the contestants who have won stuff on it, with his tutelage of course. I might have not believed it, except when we were checking in, a girl was on the phone in the open air lobby (very cool!) telling her mom that she'd just won $7000! Funny, and sweet. The open air lobby was really cool and aesthetically appealing & the pool looked clean and inviting, but it was cool during our visit and not really swimming or hanging outside kind of weather. The only drawbacks to our visit -- and these were minor inconveniences -- were that the free Wifi signal was very weak and spotty in the room, we had better luck in the outdoor seating areas (but as I mentioned, it was kind of chilly). They had a total shut down one day, so perhaps they were working on the system. Also, there was construction happening for a (needed) bar/restaurant on the premises. The banging was kind of a drag, but never before 9 a.m. and we weren't in the room much anyway. Having a restaurant right there would be a perfect addition to this funky cool spot. And the Farmer's Market across the street (and The Grove shopping complex) was just fantastic. We walked over for a number of meals and had great inexpensive food every time. (Oh -- except one morning we went to Cantor's, a 24 hour legendary deli a few blocks north -- an experience, to be sure, but not one I'd ever repeat. Try the Kokomo? Cafe on the South end of the Farmer's Market. KILLER Pancakes and great southern inspired dishes.) Another terrific place is the \"Authentic Cafe\" on Curson & Fairfax, 1/2 block north and a few blocks west of the hotel...this was a FANTASTIC dinner of south american cuisine -- herbed chicken with rice & beans and plantains, etc -- gorgeous food for a good price, about $60 with wine and tip.

Overall, I feel that the room amenities could be a bit nicer, considering the thought and nice finishings they put into the public areas of the hotel. I'm not one to be picky about beds, but the mattress was incredibly HARD, like it was the cheapest one they could find. The yellow wooden lattice that serves as a \"headboard\" of sorts behind the bed had a homemade look to it, was in need of sanding and had a couple nails sticking out of it. The floor has no carpet, just some kind of synthetic \"wood\" vinyl flooring, which made the room lack warmth. The TV, stereo are cheap brands, not fancy like the shiny brochure and webpage would lead you to believe. And the refrigerator looked like they got it from a garage sale.

That was especially true once the three of us moved from a room with two (small) double beds to a room with a king and a rollaway. The hotel refused to put a rollaway in the room with the two double beds, arguing--probably correctly--that there wasn't enough room. I liked the decor, I don't think it did much for my wife or daughter, though my wife noted the cleanliness value of hardwood floors. The bathrooms were very minimal, a tight flourescent lit space with a toilet and bathtub, though the sinks with their \"waterfall\" faucets were outside the bathroom. There were two main clerks on duty during our 3 days there--one was fine, the other seemed to come from Slacker Central Casting. Darkness at night--good. The soundproofing was so so, especially when we moved to the larger room closer to Fairfax Ave., but we ran the fan on the heating system and that drowned out traffic. The bed comfort was good, though the rollaway was a bit too springy. My wife was unhappy that the first room had only one chair--the second room had a chair and a rather steeply canted rocking chair. The location is good. The Farmers Market is right across the street and has a bunch of places to both buy fresh food and some very good stands selling prepared food--restaurant level places. You can walk to some other places in the Fairfax, such as the enormous LA County Museum.
