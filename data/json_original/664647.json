{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Budget Hotel I just spent one night at the Ginza Presso Inn, and it was great! The website is very accurate when describing this room--it's small. But there's room for everything, including luggage. The room is very clean, the staff are very friendly, and most of all, the room has a soft bed, soft pillow and is quiet! Compared to sleeping for a month on hard Chinese beds, the bed and pillow were wonderful!The Presso Inn in Ginza is only a block away from the world-famous Tsujiki Fish Market, and is conveniently located next to a world-class shopping district. A wonderful Buddhist temple is located a block away in the other direction. Everything is within walking distance, including the subways, and the Tokyo Station is a short cab drive away. The Presso Inn Ginza is a short cab drive from the last limosine bus stop from Narita Airport, which is at the Marriott Courtyard. The bus counter is by the customs exit at the airport. Just show the map printout from the Presso Inn's website when arriving at the Marriott to get a cab, and be sure to take the Presso Inn's phone number to help the cabdriver (most cabs now have GPS, so can get you right to the Presso Inn by entering the number).I highly recommend this hotel for travelers and businesspeople. Because of it's size, it's probably not a great place to hang out inside, but then, you're in the Ginza District! Go out, explore and have fun!", "Date": "Jul 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR740479572", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "detzine"}, {"Content": "\u7039\u5908\u4eb8\u9287\ufe3a\u5054\u9289\ue0fe\u5046\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(20564744, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR782871587", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u9287\u5098\u4eb1\u9288\u64b1\u4f16\u9287?> \u9287\u5098\u4eb1\u9288\u64b1\u4f16\u9287?</a> </div>"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066444-d664647-r8118563-Keio_Presso_Inn_Higashi_Ginza-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "664647", "Price": "$119"}}
