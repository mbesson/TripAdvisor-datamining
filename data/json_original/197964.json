Here is my opinion of the property: The Good: The hotel's location is terrific. Literally 2 minutes to walk to my office, and within 10 minutes walk up Rue d' Washington you emerge on the Champs Elysees, somewhat in the middle across from Louis Vuitton. I met at least 6 different front desk persons, and all spoke English well and were friendly and helpful. The room was very small--but I know Americans are used to much larger. I was alone; it would have been challenging for there to be more than one person and suitcase in the room. Not sure where they got the pictures on the website-- my room was nothing like those! The bathroom was good sized, updated, and very clean. Nice quality towels, no washcloths. There is a decent hair dryer but is the kind where you must constantly depress a button to make it work. Is there really a problem with people leaving hair dryers running while they are out of the room? I don't understand the need for those. I didn't sit and eat breakfast, I just grabbed a chocolate croissant each morning to munch while I walked. They were excellent! Another plus was the number of power outlets in the room. There is a mini bar, which is just a small refrigerator, which is good if you wish to buy water or soda and keep in your room. There are several little shops to purchase drinks and snacks up both Rue d' Artois, Rue d' Washington, and the boulanger next door. The Not-So-Good: As a business person traveling many time zones away, WiFi access is crucial to communicate with home, and to keep up with my work. I did not have good luck with the hotel wifi. It would literally disconnect every couple of minutes, and became very frustrating. My iPhone was never able to connect. I went down to the front desk for help, and another guest also commented that it was quite tricky to connect and quite finicky once connected. The last night there the internet was not functioning at all, not even for the front desk. This must be addressed, it is a big problem. The room was also very hot-- I even turned the radiator off (no wall thermostat control) but still had to open the window in the mornings after my shower. Speaking of showers, there is no shampoo and conditioner provided, only lotion and \"hair/body gel\" in a dispenser on the shower wall and by the sink. I would not use this on my hair, fortunately I had brought my own. Also, the shower water temperature would not stay steady, rather fluctuating between cold and scalding. I was constantly trying to adjust it. Took some of the fastest showers of my life because of this! The hallways are very small and very dark. There is a light you can turn on as you enter the hall (took me 2 days to find) but it is still very very dim and, as a female alone, I was scared at first. It was difficult to even find my room it was so dark. The television only got a couple of English speaking channels, CNN and Bloomberg. Because of the WiFi issue I couldn't download anything to my iTunes to watch. Worth advising is that there is a card in the lobby offering a shuttle to the airport at a reasonable price. I asked them to make a reservation for me, but the shuttle would not accommodate my time-- either 30 minutes earlier, or 20 minutes later than I felt comfortable with, given that I would be the \"last stop\" and therefore wasn't confident that it would make it on time. I then asked for a taxi, and they said that if they call a taxi it may be 10 Euro more because they travel to come to the hotel to pick you up. Rip off, but did it anyway. Fortunately I didn't notice that it was more expensive than my trip from the airport to the hotel. None of these transportation issues were the fault of the hotel, but thought I'd make everyone aware.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cWill definitely return\u201d", "Author": "francetraveltrekker", "ReviewID": "UR121872617", "Content": "The hotel is in a decent location and truly is easily within 10 minutes walk to the Champs Elysees.

We went in and the receptionist couldnt speak English, i had to point to our booking on her computer screen, she gave us a map and pointed us on our way.

Good points; The hotel is centrally located and 5-10 mins walk to the Champs Elysees and has a number of bars and cafes nearby to choose from. The room itself was clean and tidy and the price we paid for a central Paris hotel bedroom was not expensive at 129 Euros for the night with breakfast included. We found the receptionists helpful and we were able to store our luggage with the reception after we booked out so that we could wander around Paris without suitcases, we picked the luggage up at around 4.30pm with no problem. Bad points; The hotel is located off Boulevard Haussman which is a busy main road with noisy traffic starting at 7am. Although the double glazed windows shielded most of the noise it was still loud when closed. Our double bedroom was located on the first floor near to dining room and I was woken by staff at around 4.30am preparing the room loudly. I am a pretty sound sleeper and they must have crashed about a bit to wake me! Although the room was clean and tidy the bathroom and toilet were divided up which rendered the toilet being the smallest that I have encountered in a hotel. I just about squeezed into the room and although I'm tall, I'm not a lardy! Then there was the bath, if you're over 5ft it's small, my wife is of average height and she felt cramped, I looked plain mad in there. I appreciate that continental baths are conventionally small but this was bijou to say the least! The wall between our room and next door was pretty thin to the extent that we could almost make out what our neighbour was saying during his phone calls. We also had a strange wardrobe which had thin white string instead of wardrobe doors! Lastly, breakfast was ok but no better than that. All in all, the hotel is ok for a quick visit staying two nights at the most. If the hotel had been just a few doors down into the nearby side street attracting less noisy traffic and the staff didn't clatter about making as much noise as a Salvation Army band in the early hours then I could have overlooked the other minor negative points.

I had a room on the first floor, next door to the breakfast room. It was quite small - although ok for me alone, but since it has a double bed, it is obviously used as a double room as well. If I were with my husband, we would be short of space a little. But the room was nice, cosy, clean, with big TV, nice small closet for clothes, good sized bathroom. Everything quite new, tastefully decorated. Breakfast was quite disappointment, very little choice, almost nothing available besides pastry. I don't eat musli, so it doesn't count for me. It is good that we had coffee breaks during seminar :-) But coffee was very tasty and the lady servicing the breakfast room was nice, friendly and welcoming.

The hotel is nowhere near the standard I would expect for a 4 star: The rooms are only slightly bigger than the bed The bathroom facilities were reasonably good, but not clean - our toilet was stained beyond cleaning for example. Also, we found the staff difficult and rude - for example, we had booked a non smoking room and got allocated to a smoking room and they were difficult about moving us - it took us 20 minutes to persuade them to change the room we were in. Also, there was building decorating work going on which meant that there was no running water for whole days. We have no discount for this. The only positives I have are: 1.

This hotel is only worth staying if you are going to Paris on a low-low-low-low budget and with equally low expectations.", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Verona, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeat-up, not-so-nice Parisian hotel\u201d", "Author": "BenjaB", "ReviewID": "UR5545186", "Content": "I stayed here for 5 nights on a business trip, and was not impressed. No lobby to speak of, a front desk that was NOT helpful (forgot wake-up calls, for example), a tiny room with a stringy curtain over the closet rather than a door, a broken light fixture in the room, and located on a rather noisy street. I have been to Paris on business many times, and usually stay in a Best Western Parisian hotel, but compared to the others I cannot recommend this one. The only reason it gets a \"neutral\" rating is because I got a good rate on the room -- this was a business trip, after all, not a vacation.", "Date": "August 2, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Plaza Elysees", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197964-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Plaza_Elysees-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$171 - $450*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">177 Boulevard Haussmann</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75008</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "197964", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/3a/b2/8f/best-western-plaza-elysees.jpg"}}
