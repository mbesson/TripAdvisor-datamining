The location, an easy walk from the major sites, yet on a very quiet side street, was superb. We stayed 5 nights. The hotel itself is adequate at best. The guys who run the place are nice, helpful enough, but always seemed exhausted and low on energy. The rooms are small, that's okay, but stuff didn't work. Our \"double\" bed was two singles side by side made up with one set of sheets. SIngle size sheet and blanket, not adequate. There was no hot water one day, they went down the basement and flipped a switch I guess, but we lost 20 precious vacation minutes waiting for the water to heat up before we could take showers. The air conditioner is on some central energy saving system, it would run for 2 minutes, then be off for 4, then on for 2, etc. The room never got cool until our third or fourth complaint, then it blasted and we froze on our last night. The cleaning was mediocre. We were in a ground floor room our first night, the guy apologized even before we complained and promised to move us when another opened up the next day. I looked in the shower and thought \"what a great idea - black caulk so you can't tell if it's dirty.\" Closer inspection revealed that it was black with crud. Breakfast was a typical Turkish breakfast, cold buffet of yogurt, cheeses, olives, some scary looking meat, cereal, canned juices and tea. There is free WiFi and an available computer in the lobby (an iMac running Windows). The best thing about this hotel is it is in Istanbul, a great city that keeps you away from your room most of the time. There are many hotels on the same quiet street.
