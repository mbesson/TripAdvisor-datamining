Bus stop just down the road for service 249 that will take you to the Zoo station. Also Hohenzollernplatz metro station on the U3 line. The only problem I has was the lack of cleaning. The communal bathroom was not cleaned in the week I was there or my room bin emptied. Apart from that it was great. I would defiantly go back.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cClean, not expensive, but noisy\u201d", "Author": "saulejanusonyte", "ReviewID": "UR96126242", "Content": "Very nice hostel.

The room was quite big, not luxurious but very clean and with a lot of light. Big, clean bathroom - and I didn't notice the others that I shared it with. - The staff was helpful all the way. - Big free breakfast with bread, different cerals, jam, nutella, coffee, juice etc. More than satisfying. - Only 20 m. or so from a U-bahn so very easy to get into the center. And very handy and convenient when you arrive home at night. Uhlandstrasse is also a great street with shops, restaurants etc. - Very good value for the money. - Nothing really negative to say - hmm.. maybe ... I couldn't make the elevator work but I didn't even ask, so :) - I can't really believe the other negative reviews here - I wouldn't certainly go again.", "Date": "May 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent budget accomodation-not luxury but comfortable\u201d", "Author": "NA1960", "ReviewID": "UR27974242", "Content": "i stayed here Easter 2009, staff helpful + friendly.Booked single room 21Euros on booking.com. Was in room 8,washbasin, comfortable bed, sat tv + clean, small yes but good value. Buffet breakfast plenty to eat ham,cheese,jams,rolls,cerals,juice,tea+coffee. I suspect the toilet could get dirty if inconsiderate guests left it in a mess as the staff go early afternoon, but I found the toilet quite acceptable. didnt use shower as I went to the europa thermen day spa. Free wifi worked 100% + good bandwidth was able to watch my home slingbox no problem. Location excellent 3 minutes walk from hohenzollen platz (U3) which seems to run most of the night. Slight annoyances - plumbing from nextdoor ladies loo rattles/gurgles occasionaly.
