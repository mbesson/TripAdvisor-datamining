The room was nothing special, in need of an updating for sure. The lady at the front desk was rude and unhelpful. When we asked her where to park our vehicle and if there was any underground parking in the vicinity, she just gave us a flat no. We had park outside and either pay $20 or wake up at 6am to put more money into the parking machine. The washroom had a half-used roll of toilet paper and the water in the shower came out as a trickle, even turned on full-blast. The room we had was beside a staircase and you could constantly hear people walking up and down the stairs as well as hear people walking around in the rooms above. Check-out was at 11am, and when I called the front desk at 10am to ask for a later check-out, no one answered. I kept calling until finally, someone picked up at 10:50am only to tell me that yes, late check-out is available, but the fee was $25. Even for an extra 30-60 minutes! There are much cheaper hotels that always give you a late check-out if there is no one else checking in. And on the day that we were checking out, I'm sure there wasn't a stream of people waiting to check in to this hotel. Just giving us the proper customer service was all that was needed, but that was neglected.

However, once we closed the window to our room, it was actually very quiet and the room was lovely. I would definitely recommend Madison Manor for travellers in their 20's-30's and those who are looking for a charming, clean, urban B&B who don't mind a little noise.

Where to start? The incredibly rude woman who checked me in refused to allow me into my room before 3pm even though this had been previously agreed and the room was empty. When I did finally get into my basement room I rather wished I hadn't. If I stood on tiptoes on the bed and clung onto the windowsill to peer out of the window (which was 1m by 30cm at most) I could just see the gutter outside and the wheel hub of a car parked outside - not what you would call a good view. The room also smelt strongly of bleach and chlorine, giving me hope that there might be a swimming pool but no - it was just the smell from the laundry room next door. The hotel is right next to the Maddison Pub (the clue is in the name!) and so when the pub closed at 1am that night the guests were all kicked out onto the street outside where the proceeded to hang around for the next hour shouting and swearing at each other and setting off the alarm of the car parked right outside my bedroom window. The next morning when I asked the receptionist (the same incredibly rude person from the previous day ) she told me it wasn't her problem and there was nothing she could do. She told me to shut my window and turn the air con up to drown out the noise - given I couldn't even reach my window it hadn't been open anyway and this wasn't really an adequate solution. She couldn't have been less interested or apologetic if she had tried. The second (and final- thank god!) night I came back to the hotel late (to avoid the late night noise!) only to discover the cleaners (who I had had to request come to my room at 3 as they still hadn't come by then) had left my bedroom door wide open - in all likelihood it would have been open for about 8 hours. Again I complained and there was almost no apology from the same incredibly rude woman on reception. So if you want to be treated like you have no rights to privacy, peace and quiet or value for money this is the place to go but if you have any standards I would strongly recommend giving this place an incredibly wide berth - there are many many hundreds of places in Toronto that have to be better and the Maddison doesn't deserve anyone's business.", "Date": "July 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cFabulous and Affordable\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3544698", "Content": "We were very impressed! Our orignal reservation for our trip was at a hostel, but then we found out that for only CAN$10 more a night than a private room at a hostel, we had a small, but clean and comfortable room with a shower, tv, air conditioning and breakfast! Not only that, but we didn't rent a car, and when we got off of the subway, we literally walked a half-block, turned left and walked another block, turned another left, and we were there! The transportation in Toronto is AWESOME! (I wouldn't know what its like to navigate by car around there though...) We stayed for four nights, Wed-Sun and only faintly heard the pub next door (Nothing that the air conditioner couldn't drown out). We felt comfortable and relaxed. The breakfast isn't super fancy, but for the price we were very happy! (Simple bagels, cream cheese, juices, muffins, apples, etc...) The Madison is only about two blocks from a grocery, for those who want to save a little cash on food for their vacation. Toronto is a beautiful city, and we were able to enjoy it because of the combination of the excellent location of the Madison, and our willingness to walk and use public transportation. Its two blocks from the Bata Shoe Museum, about two blocks to the subway and street cars, however I recommend walking down beautiful and historic Bloor at least once during your stay!
