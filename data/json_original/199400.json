Having read many fantastic reviews on Trip Advisor I have to admit that my first reaction upon checking in to the hotel was one of disappointment. The professional photos of the hotel are very flattering. The staff on check-in were very efficient but not overly friendly. The room that we were allocated was a good size but was quite dated and stank of cigarettes. The bathroom was one of the biggest hotel bathrooms I've ever seen. Both the room and the bathroom were very clean. Having got over the initial disappointment that the room was not quite as modern as we expected, we discovered that its saving grace was its location. Hecker's is the perfect location for exploring Berlin and while it is located in a very busy area it is extremely quiet. We had 3 days of exploring the city and 3 nights where we didn't hear a peep from anyone in the corridors or outside the hotel. This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel is within walking distance of some great restaurants and is close to both the tube and the overground train station.

They recommended restaurants, made reservations, helped with directions etc. There is also a very good restaurant at the hotel - we had a very fresh sole one day for lunch.

The hotel is in Rick Steve's tourgide. It is in West Berlin right off a main shopping and dining street. The hotel has parking in the rear. The hotel is modern and clean. The staff was freindly. Our room was large with king bed, walk in closet, a little air lock that provides two doors to the hall which helped with noise. We did not realize that there was no air conditioning but we arrived late on a cool evening after a long drive from Munich. We asked for dining reccommendations at the desk as Rick says there are plenty of resturants at a square by the S-Ban station, however the desk clerk said we should not go in that direction. We were all over Germany and never felt un-safe but we were more concerned in Berlin, probably because it was our first time there and the way American's think about \"Berlin\". We opted to leave the hotel and go right to a main street with several resturants. Some resturants were closing and after being in Germany for a least a week we were getting tired of pork and potatoes. We found a little Chinese resturant back an alley way off the main street. It was called \"Hole in the Wall\" in Chinese. Food was great, don't order an entree for each person unless you are really hungry. It was late and the staff sat down and ate at a large table in the rear towards closing. It looked like a family operation. We were glad to see they did not order pizza delivery!.", "Date": "October 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cjust like the brochure\u201d", "Author": "Lisdar", "ReviewID": "UR18719933", "Content": "Good hotel excellent location,turn right 30 yards to the Ku dammstrasse turn left to a lovely leafly square full of great restaurants,and bars,close to railway station and around the corner to Berlin Zoo Lovely large room nicely decorated but with no air condition we colud leave the windows open due to us being to rear of hotel which was quiet would have liked tea/coffe making facilities but no major problem as it has a restaurant which we highly recommend overall would stay here again as the location and quality says it all", "Date": "August 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Link\u00f6ping", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel!\u201d", "Author": "CamillaLink\u00f6ping", "ReviewID": "UR10732567", "Content": "Great hotel with very large rooms, nice bathroom and a walk-in closet!

The curtains totally blacked out any light from the window which meant not waking earlier than intended, a great thing for new years day. The bathroom was a gorgeous Italian style marble tiled one with a great shower and tv.

I researched my stay on trip advisor before traveling, and decided that this is where I wanted to stay in Berlin. Combined with a decent price from hotels, I sprung for the deal. When I arrived, I was told that due to a problem with the internet (whatever that means) my reservation had arrived too late, and they were over booked. I had made my reservations over a month in advance and found out on my arrival, so this didn't make too much sense: but what was I going to do. I was taken to their sister hotel, the Domus Hotel which semi-decent, and did not ruin my trip, but the Domus is something like 2 and a half star hotel, instead of the 4 star Heckers that I was expecting. The Heckers staff were sympathetic, but offered no compensation and it really seems like this whole thing should never have happened. The moral of this story, is either to avoid the Heckers, or to avoid hotels; or at least the combination of the two, as good things have not resulted for me.
