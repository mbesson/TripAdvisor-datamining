The location is perfect right in the middle of taksim it is also 5 mts walk from istiklal street which has all the restaurants and shopping centers. The breakfast was good..not a wide range of food but it was good. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful with our tours. We ended up taking tours which the hotel helped us book in a daily basis. Much recommended if its your first time in Istanbul. The only issue which needs upgrading is the cleaning service. Our rooms were only tidied neveractully cleaned..bathrooms were not properly cleaned and bedsheets were not regularly changed. The size for triple room was comfortable. I feel the price was too expensive for the service but I enjoyed my stay since we were outside of the hotel most of the day.

Drab, little room to walk past the bed on the way to the bathroom. We were able to get upgraded to an Exec level room for the rest of the stay -- it was far better-appointed, didn't reak but held a constant 25-27 degrees C (= 77-81F!) despite our repeated requests for repair. Staff was hardly service-oriented and could offer no recommendations on restaurants, etc. The best things I can say are that they had a very plentiful and tasty breakfast buffet (included) and the area is convenient with shops, eateries and transportation from nearby Taksim Square. This place would likely meet the standards of European travelers seeking comfortable Tourist Class accomodation, but would not please more finicky Americans (like me).", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cBe careful w/ this place--there are two different types of rooms!\u201d", "Author": "shigglediggle", "ReviewID": "UR43377586", "Content": "We were a group of six who booked the Madison Hotel through a package. We paid extra in the package for a \"four star hotel\". Be aware that there are two floors of rooms that would pass as four star rooms, and then several floors of rooms above those that would barely pass as a two star room. This hotel seems to see if they can get away with putting you in the two star room, no matter how much you paid. The six of us were put into three rooms in the two star type rooms. They were miserable rooms, with bed covers so faded and worn they looked like they were from the 70's, they reeked of smoke, the A/C didn't work in one and the toilet didn't work in another, and the small TVs barely worked either. We thought maybe we got screwed by the travel agent, but instead we went to the front desk to say things were not working, and these were not four star rooms and that we paid extra money for a four star room. The management obliged and changed all of our rooms to the much better, newer rooms just a few floors lower. Everything else was fine except for trying to put us in awful rooms. I would not recommend the hotel based on this because it just seems downright sneaky to say that a place is a four star hotel and then try to get away with putting people in sub-standard rooms, with the actual four star rooms acting as the \"model rooms\".", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location, good spa, pleasant hotel\u201d", "Author": "akivalondon", "ReviewID": "UR34852213", "Content": "Put off a bit by negative reviews which proved entirely unfounded.
