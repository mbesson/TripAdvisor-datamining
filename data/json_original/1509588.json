Must say the gardens here are spectacular, very relaxing and alot to see. Rooms very simple but adequate, didn\u00b4t get back until late and then off again sightseeing in the morning again so all you need is a bed and shower!! Staff very friendly and helpfull. Breakfast was simple but when considering the price of the hotel (hostel) one can\u00b4t complain.

With excellent rates and very kind people at Reception, the residence is not in the centre but it has a tube station near. Don't expect any frills: no soap in the en-suite shower-rooms, no TV in room, very small bed and only a wooden table and chair. But if you just want to read, to walk around Barcelona and to have wonderful views -please choose the rooms at the top floor!- the Resid\u00e8ncia Salesiana Mart\u00ed Codolar is just it! They also offer meals, at a good price and very filling, with plentiful rations and very kind service as well. So all in all, no luxuries at all, very good budget accommodation!", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "happyguest200", "ReviewID": "UR119960934", "Content": "This is a great place to stay in Barcelona. The subway station is relatively close to this location. I agree that the rooms maybe small, but I didn't have any complaints. The breakfast was great. Criossants/coffee/juice and much much more more. Lunch and dinner were also included. Wine is served in huge jugs (not surprised). The \"hotel\" has a nice courtyard if you like to spend outside. All meals are served at very specific times, so if you are late you may miss out on the food, and will have to eat out.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cVery basic but has free parking\u201d", "Author": "Tanitka", "ReviewID": "UR118053986", "Content": "We (2 adults with a kid) stayed here for 3 nights.

It's that bad. I believe it's student halls (poor students) so the whole place (once you're inside) feels like a neglected school. We stayed in a three person room, the third bed of which is actually in the corridor (with a shoddy wooden wall separating you from the public walkway, complete with moulding pipes in your room. The two bed area is barren and all the beds are no more than (very old) camp beds and squeak loudly when you turn in your sleep, or one of the others turn in their sleep, or when next door do the same (the walls are less than paper thin). Do not expect a good nights sleep. The bathroom is unbelievably small, dirty, has an open drain (which smells awful) and the shower door is mouldy and, in our room, does not shut. On top of all this, it is not signposted at all from the outside so you would need to know exactly where it is to find it. Not that I would recommend that you bother. It's a good long walk to the metro station, the receptionist will not give you directions only tell you he has maps for sale. You have to go to the metro if you would like to see ANYTHING of the city except for the slum like area that the hotel is located in. It's not even cheap (apparently it is for Barcelona but in the grand scheme of things it isn't) we paid 70euros for one night for three people. We paid 20euros in Madrid (again for three) and received a much higher standard of accommodation. If I could give this 'hotel' no stars I would. DO NOT STAY HERE.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUnbeatable value\u201d", "Author": "oxenholme", "ReviewID": "UR78998280", "Content": "The hotel is based in the Montbau area, roughly a 15 min train journey from the centre of town. It won't win any prizes for being the best looking or most luxurious hotel in Barcelona, but for those looking for value will not be disappointed. PROS: 1) PRICE - The total cost was \u00a325 per person per night. I spoke to some people staying in a youth hostel that were paying more than us. You will save money by staying at Codolar. 2) Breakfast included - This made us very happy. Every day there is a buffet with croissants, bread and a selection of fillings. There is also a coffee machine and bottles of water. 3) Location - 5 min walk from the station, 10 min walk from supermarket. 4) Customer service - The staff are friendly, and everyone we spoke to had a grasp of the English language ( a rarity in Barcelona). For example, we needed some new towels and they were delivered within a few hours. CONS: 1) NO air conditioning in rooms - It reaches 27\u00b0C at NIGHT in Barcelona. So you can imagine, a lack of air conditioning was a major disappointment for us when we arrived at the hotel. Sleeping was difficult the first few nights, after that we adapted to the temperatures. 2) Location - The hotel is not in walking distance of anything. You will need to take a train daily to see Barcelona. This will cost \u20ac1.40 per journey. You can also buy 10 journeys for \u20ac8. 3) No Luxuries - For this price, we didn't expect much. There is no swimming pool, however there is a fountain with turtles swimming in it.
