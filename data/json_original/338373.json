We stayed for just one (Saturday) night and paid \u00a3150 for a double room, en suite, including a full English and continental breakfast. Other hotels were double the price. Considering this was the Saturday before Valentine's Day when lots of people visit London's restaurants, this was excellent value. We booked on the Grange Hotels website and got the best price. I received a confirmation e-mail from the hotel very quickly, answering a question I had raised on the booking. All very impressive. We booked an en-suite room and ended up in the basement in room 6. The room had a view of a backyard, but we weren't there to admire it and it really didn't bother us. Here's what we liked: location - only a 10 minute brisk walk from Covent Garden and 15 minutes from the West End theatres and London Euston station, friendly, helpful and efficient staff on Reception and the breakfast room, decor: a nice balance between traditional style and modern ameneties, cleanliness, a modern and secure room key system, reasonably sized room, comfortable and warm bed, small but very nice en-suite bathroom, traditional, snug decor in the room, choice of food at breakfast and your ability to decide whether to pay more for a cooked breakfast, or stick with the continental options, which were plentiful, and finally, being able to leave our bag before check-in and after check-out for free so we could enjoy London without trundling our luggage behind us. There was nothing we didn't like, but be warned: rooms on the front of the hotel are at the mercy of noisy lorries passing through this small street. To ensure a good night's sleep either ask for a room facing away from the street or take ear plugs and turn up the volume on your alarm clock. It was a very cold weekend and there was an icy blast through the old window frames, which you only felt if you stood right next to them. The thick curtains kept most of the chill out, but unfortunately the raidators were belting out heat right behind them! Only a minor problem though.

Trust me, I wouldn\u2019t be writing this review were it not for the fact I paid $200 a night for a hotel that promises to be MUCH more than it is. The only pros that I could come up with were that the location is decent, the rooms weren\u2019t especially dirty, the bathrooms aren\u2019t bad, and the staff was not unfriendly. In other words, a place I might be willing to pay $80 a night for. Other than that\u2026..it\u2019s an overpriced pretentious little rip-off place. 1) There is NO internet access in the rooms and NO WIFI access anywhere in the hotel. This for a hotel that claims to be suitable for the \u201cmost discerning business traveler.\u201d But if you want to connect to the net, you do have two options. You can use the wired internet in the lobby with no privacy (and the screen facing the lobby)\u2026..or I kid you not: you can pay the staff 10 pounds a day and they\u2019ll connect you to the wireless access from THE HOTEL ACROSS THE STREET with some kind of secret code they have \u2013 they type it into your computer and won\u2019t let you see what they type. Dodgy at best. Incidentally, even with this connection from the hotel across the street, it only works in the lobby also. One has to laugh reading the note from the MD in the hotel guide book that says the rooms have the \u201clatest technology.\u201d I guess he must mean that they do, indeed, have flush toilets because that is the only \u201ctechnology\u201d I saw that was the latest. 2) A number of rooms are in what they call the \u201csub-basement\u201d which is a horrible little area below street level. Naturally, my room was there. I can\u2019t think of anybody that would knowingly spend $200 a night for a BASEMENT room. Since the rooms at this level are generally airless and hot, you are forced to open the virtually viewless window \u2013 and therefore concurrently suffer the indignities of people looking directly down into your room \u2013 only a few feet away from the street. And since it\u2019s so close, you also have to listen to mostly drunken conversations periodically all night long. Getting your bags to this \u201csub-basement\u201d is another ordeal. Of course no lift; nobody to help with bags; and you have to navigate a very dangerous, steep, curving, and narrow set of stairs to get to that level. No handle for the first four or five stairs on the top either. Bit scary actually. 3) The rooms are tiny. I suppose about 140 square feet with absolutely NO place to put a suitcase (because there isn\u2019t even room for a suitcase stand). Remember you\u2019re paying about $200 (129 Pounds a night) for this - terrible value \u2013 even by London standards. Very claustrophobic \u2013 and even more so because of the view from the sub-basement. 4) There is a direct dial telephone in the room, but as you might expect, usury rates. About $6.00 for a 5 minute national call to the UK. A real rip off. 5) Breakfast is not included in the rates \u2013 or at least wasn\u2019t in my rates. A very simple cold buffet goes for about $18 and an \u201cEnglish Breakfast\u201d for about $25.00. This is not gourmet dining\u2026..but simple, ordinary, and tired fare. Not bad food, just another rip off from this rip off hotel. You\u2019d do much better (and get at least comparable quality food) going to even McDonalds. 6) The TV is about 20 years old (or so it seems) \u2013 maybe a 15 inch screen \u2013 6 or 7 channels from which to choose \u2013 and in my case, a remote control that did not work. 7) The in-house hotel guide promised free newspapers (and magazines for that matter) in the rooms. Of course during the whole time I was there \u2013 none. Asked for a newspaper \u2013 and was directed to a nearby newsstand by the gal at reception. Had to laugh. Not her fault, of course. London is notorious for vastly overpriced hotels. This one is one of many. Highly suggest you find another place that isn\u2019t so outrageous. Lots of hotels nearby that are equally lousy, but at least they aren\u2019t as pretentious (claiming to be what they are not), and most are about 50 or 60% of the price of the Lancaster. Good example is the Tavistock about 5 min walk away. Rooms are equally dreary, but 2 big differences. First is the price is about half. Second is that price includes a pretty good all you can eat hot breakfast. Another added plus is free internet in the lobby. Its as least as good as the Lancaster \u2013 and you\u2019ll save a lot of money.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Surprise\u201d", "Author": "In_My_Opinion76", "ReviewID": "UR121642008", "Content": "After reading some poor reviews I was a bit nervous about booking this hotel, but once I got there I was pleasantly surprised by the room, the high standard and the staff.

It was only an overnight business trip, but I have to say I was highly disappointed by this hotel. Having already had to phone three times to get the correct name on my booking, I was greeted at the hotel with a room completely different to the one I had booked. Instead of getting a double room with its own en-suite, I was given a single room with no bathroom. Pretty different really, and considering the price my company had shelled out it wasn't a good start. The room was absolutely tiny, and was so hot it felt like a sauna. That was, until you opened the curtains, the windows were very drafty indeed. Nevertheless, despite being too tall for the tiny bed, I managed to get some sleep. The next drama came at breakfast, having already booked this I wandered into the breakfast room to have something to eat. \"Sir, you have not booked breakfast with your room\" I was greeted with, however I drew out my booking to confirm the fact I had purchased it. I was then made to stand in the corner of the room, like a convict almost, while the waiter spent 15 minutes discussing with reception whether I had paid or not. They still didn't believe me, and I was forced to sign several forms before being able to sit and eat. Honestly though, with the poor standard spread available I wish I hadn't bothered and had gone to Starbucks for a coffee instead. All things considered, I was left feeling very disappointed by this hotel, which is a shame as The Grange White Hall had left me with such a good opinion of the group.

Eventually I found a very decent rate (\u00a370) for a single room with shower (but no toilet) at The Lancester. Firstly, it is very nicely placed in Bloomsbury very near to both Holborn and Russell Square, and therefore close to Covent Garden, as well as not too far from Kings Cross/Euston and Leicester Square. It is also a stone's throw from Russell Square and the British Museum. The central proximity had me assuming that I was going to be staying in a bit of a pit, given how much I had paid. Actually, the hotel is perfectly nice, and a great deal cleaner and welcoming than a lot of the cramped hovels around King's Cross. The room I was in was really very large - it seemed much more like a double, as did the bed, which felt more like a small double than a single. When I checked with the front desk, they confirmed that it was definitely a single. There was decent toiletries available, and a powerful hot shower in the room, plus a TV that actually worked, good tea and coffee facilities and a comfortable and very clean bed (perfect for self-pleasuring). I was unsure about the fact that I had to share a toilet, but I never saw a single soul and when I emptied my bowels on the morning of departure (which mainly consisted of the vegetable dansak I had consumed the night before on Brick Lane) I was delighted to find that the toilet itself was very nice and extremely clean.

I spent 2 nights at the Lancaster hotel in Bloomsbury. In short this is what I think of the hotel: On the down side: * we booked this hotel via our travel agent in March 2010, we specifically requested an en-suite room (so with toilet inside the room) because we had read on Tripadvisor that most rooms are only semi-suite. I do not like to wander the corridors at night in my PJ's. Upon check-in we learned there was no en-suite room available. We could check-in The Clarendon across the street (same hotel chain), but there would be an extra charge. We of course refused, it was booked half a year ago and confirmed by our travel agent! The receptionist asked us to wait in the lobby while she called the head of reservations. Through all this the receptionist was very polite and professional. 5 Minutes later she told us everything was fine, we could have an en-suite room in the Lancaster. * there were only 2 sockets in the room, both in use. So when we wanted to charge our cell phones and cameras we had the pull out the wires. This is just a minor detail!!! But it might be interesting to know if you're carrying a lot of electrical equipment that needs charging. On the plus side: * so eventually we got our en-suite room. It turned out to be a triple room on the lower ground level, located at the end of a corridor, no other rooms in that corridor, so we were very private. The room and bathroom were huge! We were only 2 persons, so we had all the room we needed. We had two seperate beds, a sofa, a writing table, a normal table, a tv, a wardrobe, a smaller closet and a table to put our luggage on. Since we were on lower ground level we had no view, we were looking at a wall, but we were only in our room in the morning and in the evening. The shower was in the bath tub. The beds were soft and comfortable. Room temperature was a bit chilly but that's just what we like. For your info: it was room 008. * baggage can be left at reception * every morning The Independant was delivered. The hotel staff put it in front of our door. Very attentive. * Staff was very friendly, helpful and professional. Even during our check-in, when we were surprised not the have been allocated an en-suite room, the receptionist handled the situation in a professional manner. On our second day (in the morning) we wanted to check the weather forecast (the previous day there was a printed sheet on the reception desk with the forecast). The sheet wasn't there, the receptionist immediately printed the forecast for us. Also on our second day (in the evening) we had to use the internet in the lobby (\u00a3 3 for 15 minutes), because we needed to check the Eurostar website, there was a strike in Belgium. We only used the computer for 3 minutes and when we wanted to pay the receptionist told us we needn't pay because it was so short. Twice we ordered a cab. It took less than 2 minutes before the cab arrived and the concierge escorted us from the lobby to the taxi, holding open all of the doors and carrying our luggage. * Breakfast was superb. There was a certificate on the wall saying that the hotel won the Breakfast Award in 2009. It was continental buffet breakfast, but you could also order English breakfast if you wanted. Within 1 minute there was someone standing at our table asking if we wanted to drink something warm (tea, coffee or chocolate milk) and if we wanted toast. Another minute later our order was delivered to our table. The buffet itself consisted had croissants, sandwiches and several other pastries. All kinds of jam, 4 kinds of cornflakes, milk, fruit juice, water, a lot of fruit, cheese and ham. An ideal way to start your day. I didn't need food until 2 pm after having had breakfast in The Lancaster! * Good location! We walked from St. Pancras to our hotel, a good 15 to 20 minutes walking. Most of the time we used the tube system of course. The tube station is Russell Square, 10 minutes walking from the hotel. The Lancaster is located in a quiet street between two parks. Several other Grange hotels are located in that street. So overall: - friendly, professional, helpful and attentive staff - good location - spacious and clean room with comfortable beds - superb breakfast I would definitely stay in this hotel, and recommend it to other people.

Furnishing in the rooms is cheap but looks fine. But there are some small things that over a few days became annoying. Lack of wi-fi is the main one. I was travelling for business so it was particularly irritating but surely most people travelling nowadays need access to the internet to check flights, details, schedules, etc. There was one common computer downstairs but it was usually busy. I thought almost all hotels, even cheap ones, now had wi-fi? Its an easy thing to fix but I would not stay here again unless it was available. Also, the rooms were far too warm. Temperature in London was very high but there seemed to be heat coming from the floor below and one of the windows would not stay open properly so it was very hard to keep the room cool at night.

The location was perfect for what we were using it for \u2013 a gig in Camden and generalised tourist wandering. The hotel is in close proximately to Tottenham Court Road, Holborn and Russell Square tube stations and there are plenty of buses that pass in and around the area. There are so many amenities and tourist attractions within walking distance including banks, mini supermarkets, bars, restaurants and the fantastic British Museum. Once arriving at the hotel, the hotel reception staff were pleasant and efficient. We were given the general hotel policies and were offered help with baggage. We\u2019re used to stairs in our apartment building so it didn\u2019t bother us that there wasn\u2019t a lift service (that we could see). We received wake up calls and The Independent newspaper was delivered daily, which was a treat whilst drinking your morning cup of tea. The room itself was quite large by London standards. Our room was a Semi-Ensuite, which as you probably already know by now is a shower and wash basin in your room and shared toilet facilities outside. Don\u2019t let this put you off though, we never had to wait for the toilet facilities and it was cleaned and replenished as required. We had room number 105, which was on the first floor and facing the road. The room had two very large windows, which opened completely, which in hind side we were totally grateful for. Expect a little noise during delivery hours in this room\u2013 you are in London, not in the middle of the countryside. The weather was glorious on the days we were staying in London and the hotel unfortunately doesn\u2019t have any air conditioning. The room was absolutely stifling on occasions. However, the windows came into use and there was a small desk fan in the wardrobe that you were able to use. The general d\u00e9cor of the room was quite bog standard for England. The room could benefit for some slight renovations or aesthetic amendments for example, the sheet on the bed had seen better days, the wardrobe door never closed properly and the TV channel opportunities wouldn\u2019t really suit the foreign travellers who want to keep up with general affairs. However this is a three star hotel; there were opportunities in the Grange Hotel range to be upgraded to a higher star hotel in the same area. We paid \u00a3188 for two nights (inc. VAT/Room Only) and were quite pleasantly surprised. The only downside to the room itself was that the shower and wash basin area could probably benefit from tiling. Around the shower area the carpet was starting to smell musty and was looking worn from the water damage. We used one of the towels provided as a \u2018bath mat\u2019, which grated on me for all of about 5 seconds. The room was cleaned down daily and replenished with towels and tea & coffee items. We requested ironing facilities during our stay, which was awaiting use on our arrival. There was also a welcome pack including maps and general hotel/London information which came in handy whilst figuring out what tourist attractions we wanted to visit. We never tried breakfast/room service facilities; there are just so many restaurant and bar options in and around Central London. I believe the hotel were offering breakfast at \u00a317.50 for full English and \u00a315.50 for Continental if you have booked at a RO basis. We also never tried the hotels laundry, driver or internet facilities, so I couldn\u2019t comment. However I did see the one computer in the main lounge area which could be used for e-mails etc (at a fee I suspect). All in all \u2013 I would go back to one of the Grange Hotels.

Room is small but adequate (we were there only to sleep). No air conditioning, but they do provide a fan and in-room coffee/tea. Continental breakfasts were ample and quite good.

The room was a bit more spacious than I expected, with a lovely little coffee/tea service station. The staff was extremely accommodating (they even found us a complimentary mending kit at a sister hotel and brought it over!) and there were no hidden charges upon check out. Internet was expensive (and not wifi), so we went without that. Though the weather in London was pretty perfect (just around 70F most days, I think), the room did get very warm the first day/night. THEN we figured out how to open the huge windows, and did so each time we returned to the room, and the temperature was fine for the rest of the trip.

There are no elevators in this hotel so I had to drag my suitcase down the stairs but it wasn't that bad. Having booked the hotel prior to reading the reviews I was ready for the fact the loo was outside the room but to my surprise I got a room with both shower and bath and a loo :) The room was big and spacious with a queen size bed, TV, work area, there was a ventilator, ironing board and coffee/tea making facilities. It was a great treat for a solo budget traveler and the location made it even more wonderful ! Althought in general everything was great , there are two spoilers that bothered me a bit . The first one was the strange noise I kept hearing which I figured out to be the noise of the tube on the Piccadily line that apparently passes right under the hotel :) but still it wasn't that bad as I didn't spend the day in the room and I was so tired at night that it didn't really bother my sleep. The one thing that did annoy me more than that was the fact that the hotel doesn't have a luggage room. This was especially annoying since my flight back was at 22:30 and the hotel staff weren't really keen on helping me , they could only appologise and say it was \"company policy\" so I found myself dragging my bags to Euston station (in case you would like to use this option it costs 6.5 Pounds per bag).
