After reading some of the reviews I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. Our room was in the building next door to the main reception and was accessed on a buzzer system. Our room was at the top of the building (51 steps, and after a full day walking around I felt every one them) and was facing onto the rear, so despite its proximity to the railway we were not overly bothered with noise. The room was quite spacious and although very basically furnished was spotlessly clean and the beds were comfortable. The toilet/wet room was a little on the small side but again adequate with good sized towels provided, although the waste under our sink could do with fixing as it leaked. They could also do with a mirror in the bedroom as there is only one small one in the bathroom.There was a t.v but as there is only Italian programs on was of no interest to us. The continental breakfast provided was good with a choice of cereals, bread (toaster provided) jams and croissantes with good coffee, tea (bags) and fruit juices. All in all, for the price, a good 2* with friendly staff and well placed, being only a 15 minute straight walk from Termini. I would certainly stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who just wants a clean basic room.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade, null, Serbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and hotel\u201d", "Author": "Krzysztof G", "ReviewID": "UR121738527", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews on this site I didn't expect much from this hotel however, on arrival we soon realised the bad reviews were most definitely incorrect.

Unfortunately, there was extremely weak wifi connection in room, I had to constantly sit at the lobby and the breakfast area downstairs, and it was extremely cold than. Breakfast was continental, crossiants, toast and a wide variety of preserves, and not forgetting espressos which will be served upon request. Despite it was merely 600metres away just straight down the left road of the termini, I had difficulty locating it. I must say I am a pretty good navigator, but my overall bad rome experience had impaired my navigation intinct. New Year day, a \"police\" whom drove passed me while I was heading back just merely less than 100 metres away from the hotel door. This \"Police\" flashed his badge and kept it almost immediately, demanded for my passport. As in doubt, I requested to see his \"Police\" badge again and he pull over his vehicle in the middle of the lane and got down. He started going through all my belongings as I refused to let go of my passport. The thing which made me real in doubt, this \"Police man\" started to sniff my wallet and my bag, took out my debit card, cash, accusing me that I am a Japanese and if I have cigarettes on me. His weird actions made me puzzled, just as he was holding on to my belongings, out of now where my courage started overcoming my fear. I snatched my things back from him and shouted \"YOU ARE TRYING TO RUN AWAY WITH MY THINGS RIGHT!\" The conjested traffic which was caused by his pull over vehicle started honking. He jetted off. I returned to Hotel Midi, told the guy who was tending the reception about what happened and understand that this \"Policeman\" is probably an imposter. First, Police should be driving a police car and not a private car. Secondly, Police always travel in pair. At last, this Policeman whom I met is not an italian. Lesson learnt after this encounter, never hand over anyone your belongings, offer to WALK to the nearest police station if this happens to me again. Nevertheless, I must thank the Reception guy whom had cleared my doubts, in order for me have a piece of mind for the rest of my remaining journey.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Raz86", "ReviewID": "UR102611325", "Content": "After reading a number of negative reviews of this hotel, I was a bit apprehensive about my trip to Rome. It was my first time there and I wanted everything to be perfect! We arrived at the hotel at night and the surrounding area looked dirty, unfriendly and a little intimidating. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by the Midi Hotel. We were buzzed in at the door which made us feel very safe, and upon entering we were delighted to see a very clean and open reception area with a staff member who spoke perfect English. Our room was on the first floor, overlooking the conservatory for breakfast, and the garden. We had a balcony, which was great for sitting out after a long day of walking, and also very handy as my partner smokes (ash trays are provided). Our room was small and compact, but very cosy and comfortable, however the bathroom was tiny and the toilet was awkwardly placed and hard to use. There is a bedet, in the centre of the room and the toilet is between the shower and a wall and is very cramped. We are both tall so it was a little awkward, but this is only a minor issue. The shower was small, with a fixed shower head and a detachable one, and the water pressure was great. The corner of our shower had a leak, so afterwards we put a towel down to dry up the water, which wasn't much. We didn't use the TV or mini bar, we really just wanted a place to sleep. The bed was very comfortable, and there wasn't much noise at the back of the hotel, so if you don't like noise I would recommend asking for a room at the back. The room had shutter and glass doors that lead onto the balcony, and it was nice to leave the shutters open as it was quite warm at night (even in March). The breakfast was pretty basic, bread that you had the option to make toast with, pre packed croissants, cereal and juice. We only ate breakfast one day of the four we stayed, not because we didn't like it but because we were either out quite early or we slept in a bit. The location of the hotel is great, close enough to the Termini station and within walking distance to many sights. We got Roma Passes on our first day and would recommend them for free entrance to two museums or archeological sites,and free travel on all metro, bus and tram routes (they cost \u20ac25 and are valid for three days). We used the metro a lot and it was very easy to find our way around. There is a great restaurant, a street away on Via Manzoni called RED, and we ate there every night. The food is seriously nice, and very reasonably priced, and the staff are very welcoming and friendly and speak English as well as Italian. They really love to hear a few words in Italian, as do most other Italians. They seem to make more of an effort to help you if you make an attempt to use their language. Overall, the Midi Hotel was a fantastic base for us over the four days we spent in Rome. The location and price were perfect, as well as helpful staff, some of whom went that extra mile to help us. I had an excellent time in Rome and I can't wait to go back already. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is lovely, really!!!\u201d", "Author": "Ashleybradley", "ReviewID": "UR80281318", "Content": "Having read all the bad comments regarding this hotel before I travelled, I wasn't looking forward to going there.

One member of staff was very helpful, polite and personal, always remembering me and my room number. Breakfast was simple: cereal and toast, but with all that pasta and pizza to be had later it was enough for me and again, not bad at all. The only quibble was the location. The trams outside didn't seem to go to the city centre so had to walk to Termini for the metro but again, not a tremendous issue. One thing to remember when reading reviews, people are different and expectations are different. Since all I wanted was somewhere to crash at night, I found it more than adequate. Had I expected anything more, then maybe not but I was pleased with it, very pleased with all aspects.

On the possible negative sides: - a previous review stated that they had an issue with water leaking from the last floor that they are building on top of the building. Well they don't seem to have completed the works, so that might be a cause of trouble - to enter the hotel you need to ring a bell and the receptionist will open the door from their desk. On my first night a guest was ringing that bell at least for half an hour before someone appeared. - the reception staff changed many times throughout my stay, at least four or five different people attended me during my three night stay, which seems far too many for a 10 room hotel. - the hotel next door \"Hotel Center\" seems to share the reception with the Midi, in fact their customers plus other Hotel's customers on the other side of the patio had breakfast at the Midi, all comunicatiing through the Patio.
