No. This is not a hotel.\u201d", "Author": "TAS84", "ReviewID": "UR119645790", "Content": "A hotel is a somewhere you go to feel comfortable during the overnight hours of your vacation/business trip or get away. In this case, Montreal for the weekend with my significant other. \"Hotel\" Dorion, is not a hotel. The only way in which it resembles a hotel is there are rooms with 4 walls made up of physical matter and filled with oxygen. (Oxygen with a, lets say, unique, smell to it.) There are 1000 reasons to not stay here, I'll present them in logical order. Upon arriving, you'll quickly learn there is NO parking area. You have to park on the street surrounding the hotel. Not an uncommon thing in Montreal, although in this case, you get to feel a bit uneasy about the young men standing on the corner of Rue Dorion running his \" business\" watching you unload your suitcases from your vehicles at 10:00pm, hoping that your vehicle will still be there in the morning. When you make your way to the entrance, you will then get to \"buzz in\" to gain access to the \"hotel\", nothing makes you feel more welcomed as a guest then having to buzz into your hotel. If you're granted access, you walk up the staircase which is basically an apartment building up to the 2nd level where \"reception\" is. Get use to my quoting of words, as what you traditionally expect from a hotel, you won't find here. So when you get upstairs to check in, the front desk worker basically verified we had an reservation, confirmed we had prepaid for it, ( which if it hadn't been, we'd have turned around a left before even seeing our \"One bedroom suite\". ) So he hands us a key, says your room is this way, and off we go. Strolling through this apartment building style \"hotel\" wondering what we've gotten ourselves into. We arrive at our door, look at each other, and just stake our heads, as we know what to expect just from our first impression of Hotel Dorion. (3 minutes since we got out of our car) So we open the door to find,.. why don't I just summarize to save you some time before you begin looking for another hotel as you sit at your computer. (I beg of you) - The smell hits you in the face. - Room is tiny, bed in the middle of the room, night stand. Old beat up TV. Lamp. Nothing more. - Bathroom off that room, door is one more opening away from falling off the hinges. - No soap in the bathroom. - Towels, while folded ( bravo ) look 15 years old. - The toilet itself, lets just say its a squatting situation. - The carpet in the room is filthy. kept our shoes on. - The Bed sheets. Yeah, we didn't find out. One look at the bed and I was infinitely thankful my significant other packed a sheet. We laid it over the entire bed, and slept on that, arms at our sides because it still felt so dirty. The bedspread was stained, again, 15+ years old. - Old, old, stinky, dirty, old, old. Yuck. That's basically how it can be summed up. We are a younger couple, we don't have extremely high expectations of hotels, as we don't travel much. A holiday inn, best western, totally fine hotels. $100-$140 dollar a night range is totally fine with us. ( This was $85 ) However, there are SIMPLE. BASIC. Things anyone would expect from a hotel that this place simple CANNOT provide. Comfort, BASIC amenities, cleanliness. Dorion has none of it. We had unfortunately booked for SEVERAL days, a couple hundred bucks we gladly flushed down the crapper that is Hotel Dorion after the first night. Our flight was in late that evening, and really just needed to crash. ALSO: Please, please, please know. That the positive reviews on trip advisor are CLEARLY phony. Most definitely created by an employee/owner to create a rouse so people will give Dorion a chance. People have said they'll only stay here when traveling to Montreal, clean rooms, friendly staff ( they weren't unfriendly, but the whole business lacks any customer service. ) All of it is complete crap. I mean this with no disrespect, but if I were homeless, I would SERIOUSLY consider the street over this establishment. A few things in closing. You can read some reviews here about the hotel being above a strip club. Fact. Also it is used regularly for prostitution. While we saw a few \" candidates\" who were checking in right behind us, likely for the \"hourly\" rate that is clearly advertised right at the front desk, I can't confirm this, but it's a safe bet. We obviously did our best to basically lock ourselves in our room to avoid seeing anything else that would make us cringe. We eventually went batshit crazy in our room laughing about the whole situation, and decided there and then that we'd be writing this in hopes of saving other unsuspecting people their money, and time. In closing, we rolled the dice and used a third party site to book this hotel (expedia, hot wire , etc ) SHAME ON THEM for advertising/partnering with an establishment like this. For real? I understand there are such things as 1 and 1/2, and 2 star hotels, but that's not what this is, it's a dump. That third party site lost our business for all future travels, and I planned on contacting them formally as well.

The staff at Dorion are wondeful,and the manager of the hotel was incredibly helpful at setting things up for me. Dorion is easy to get to by the Metro (Subway) once you get your bearings coming in from the Montreal train station, get off at Papineau stn, BUT look for Rue Dorion on the left side of the subway exit and you will see a Metro grocery store. The rooms are clean mostly quiet and very no frills especially on the 2nd floor as it is an older part of the hotel.

Also, the location was literally across the street from the Metro and there was almost no noise coming from the strip club under the hotel (even though my window was directly above the club).
