The doors do not insulate for noise at all and a neon lam in the room blinked when turned off. Breakfast is average,ok if you like everything with too Much sugar.

The staff, especially Carlo are welcoming and happy to make my visit all it can be. Located on Via Nazionale it is a walkable distance from the train station, and 7 minutes at most, by taxi. Rooms are clean, generous and some have larger bathrooms due to their location. Above the 4th floor are private apartments, so I request a 2nd floor to minimize possible noise from 'family time.' Rooms are equipped with a desk, a free safe and there is stocked refrigerators charging reasonable prices for water, wine and snacks. Giolli is rated 3-star and its rates are very reasonable, especially for the city of Rome. Breakfasts include juices, hard-cooked eggs, fresh croissants, rolls, tarts, cheese and Italian cold cuts. There is a barista too, who will serve up your morning cappuccino or espresso. The location of the Giolli couldn't be better to visit all of the historical sites Rome offers. From the front of the building you can see the Vittorio Emmanuel 'wedding cake' building and it is a short walk to it and all of Rome's historic sites. To visit the Trevi Fountain, so you can toss in your coins & return, you just cross the street (Via Milano) and walk through the tunnel, take a left and you're there. Across from the hotel is the Exposition building which offers changing exhibitions, including free photographic exhibits, a cafe and great book and gift store. A taxi stand is directly across from the hotel and in the blocks nearby are several good trattorias and restaurants. Several buses run down Via Nazionale and with the bus signs that list all of the stops, you can't get lost unless you want to! Flying back to the West Coast USA means a hideously early airport departure. But to let you know how thoughtful the staff is, a breakfast is set up for me to eat before my car arrives to take me home. Reading some of the reviews that mention some problems, I'd would like you to give the Giolli Hotel another visit and you'll find, as I did, that the staff are really warm and professional.

We were celebrating our 29th Wedding Anniversary in Rome. We had booked our trip through Airmiles, but after booking we attempted to upgrade our room through the Giolli from a standard room. Unfortunatley this was not possible but we were very kindly presented with a bottle of sparkling wine on our arrival by way of apology. We were initially disappointed with our standard room as it was very small and the view, as described in previous reviews, was onto an outside space and other windows. But the room was spotlessly clean and in reality how much time do you want to spend in your hotel room when you have Rome on the doorstep! And quite literally there was so much on the Giolli's doorstep. Fantastic central location which made it very easy to get around and see all of the sights - make sure that you have comfy shoes! So many lovely restaurants very close to the hotel. Highly recommend the pizzeria Ricci - Est Est Est - just round the corner! The Giolli's breakfast was fairly basic but certainly adequate enough to kick start your day. The staff were all very efficient but not overly friendly.....we certainly weren't greeted with friendly smiley faces at any point but we were happy to settle for answers to any queries that we had and we certainly got this.

Our a/c unit didnt work very well, we did mention it to reception but didnt get any assurance as to whether someone was going to look at it so as a result with the Roman weather it was quite stuffy at night. Our safe was also broken so we had to leave valuables inside a locked suitcase. It also has the tiniest lift (elevator) you have ever seen which kind of added to its quirkiness but probably not so good if you suffer from claustraphobia!

Carlo, our evening desk clerk, really made our Rome stay fantastic. Not only is he delightful and friendly, he gave great suggestions for reasonably priced restaurants (with courtesy welcome drink coupons) and great suggestions for a Pompeii tour and how best to get to the Vatican (subway). He helped cultivate my primitive Italian, and compared it to Spanish, which I can speak. Carlo is a definite 10. Carlo warned us about pickpockets in crowded areas, especially on public transit. Nevertheless, my husband and I got separated by the crowd getting on the Metro. We were both on high alert, keeping our wallets in front packs, with our hands on the zippers. My husband ignored the distraction of someone tapping him on the shoulder a couple of times, but was blocked exiting. One guy blocked the door, holding the handrail, forcing him to squeeze through. On the platform, my husband's front pack zippers were unzipped about 2\", up to where his hand was. Nothing was taken from the pack, but someone did pickpocket his front jeans pocket.

The gentleman who works the front desk during the day (until 3) did not greet us, did not smile and was generally extremely unpleasant and unfriendly. This week was a week of 85-90 degree temperatures and the remote for the air conditioner was not in the room. When we requested it, this man at the front desk argued with us and told us that it was central air and he couldn't give us a remote for our room. We persisted for 10 minutes and he agreed to call someone to find a remote. After waiting 30 minutes, we went back to the front desk and asked a young woman if she could assist us. She did and we finally got a remote so we could use the AC. Unfortunately, it was very weak and did not cool the room adequately. We could not sleep. Next, our room was not cleaned - when we returned to our room at 3:30 p.m. we asked if anyone would be cleaning it and we were told it should have already been done. We told them it wasn't and they said they would have it done immediately. We left again and returned at 8:00 p.m. to find that it still hadn't been cleaned. Carlo at the front desk had one of the housekeepers clean it immediately, offered us a free cocktail and sent us a bowl of fresh fruit ,which was very thoughtful. The next day when the housekeeper came to clean the room we were still there and asked her to clean it \"pui tarde\" which I believe means \"later.\" Again, we returned that evening to find it had not been cleaned. We returned to the Giolli for one night after our Tuscany visit. We had hoped to book a different hotel after our awful experience the first 4 days but were unable to do so. We were again met by the unpleasant, rude front desk employee. He did not even say good morning, hello, welcome back - nothing. We were given a much larger room (which we later learned was due to Carlo marking our reservation as VIP). While we were checking in we asked if the remote for the air conditioning was in the room. We were told it was. We asked again and also asked if it was working and we were told it was. We went to the room to find that there was no remote for the AC. We went back to the front desk and again asked for the AC remote. We waited 30 minutes and were finally given the remote. It was worse than the previous room and did not cool the room at all. We were awake the entire night. The elevator is so small that we could only fit the luggage and one of us in it. The room smelled like cigarette smoke and the beds were hard and uncomfortable. However, the rooms were clean, the breakfast was adequate and the hotel is in a great location. I would rate the hotel as a 2 star, not a 3 star. Then, there's Carlo. He is pleasant, thoughtful, knowledgeable, and extremely helpful. He should be working at a much better hotel where his talents would be appreciated. He made excellent restaurant recommendations and generally treated us with respect and kindness. If it weren't for him our Rome visit would not have been as pleasant as it was.

I had checked out prices and locations prior to the trip but it was a last-minute deal and we were flying standby so we didn't want to book anything and lose a deposit. We were very pleasantly surprised at our find and the good value price we received especially considering it was Holy Week (week before Easter) in Rome. We had a little trouble locating the street and hotel from the directions we were given but it is a reasonable 10-15 minute walk from Rome Termini train station. We arrived at the hotel around Noon and they were able to let us check in right away. The room was clean and efficient with just enough space for the two of us. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom large and clean. The hotel is very well kept and the reception is on the 2nd floor of the building. There is a tiny 2-person max (typical) lift in the stairwell that will be useful for those on higher floors. We wound up on floor 3 so often it was easier to use the stairs. The hotel desk staff was quite helpful and accomodating to show us locations on maps and recommend sights and restaurants nearby. The breakfast room and sitting lounge is just off the hotel desk on the 2nd floor. The breakfast was a good selection for a usual European continental service with cereal, yogurt, breads, pastries, cold meat and cheese slices and various juices and coffees. They also will serve espresso and capuccinos to order. The breakfast room was often quite busy but we were always able to locate a table right away. The hotel is located midway between Termini station and the Victore Emmanual Monument. Most locations for sightseeing are within a 20-30 minute walking distance and a bus stop for various lines is nearby on the street (Via Nazionale) to take you to Termini or any other location. There are a number of shops and banks along Via Nazionale along with several restaurants located on the street and various side streets up and down the avenue. A pharmacia is only a block or so away and a tourist info center is across the street. Overall I highly recommend the hotel and felt it was a great value.

Additionally, the air conditioner was ineffective and the room, although clean, was dingy and depressing due to poor lighting, and a broken (literally, hanging off the wall) lamp that was not fixed for the entire duration of our stay - 8 nights! Breakfast was typical of Italy, however, sometimes we were charged for capaccino and sometimes we were not. I requested an additional room key and was told I could only receive one key because they were unique, however, other guests (though, not all) did receive duplicate keys.

One day we arrived for breakfast 10 minutes before closure, (yes we overslept that day but still in time for a croissant and coffee) and the girls turned the coffee urn spicketss away from us as we approached and quickly moved the croissants behind the counter. The final straw was after checking with the desk clerk the night before about calling a taxi for us in the morning, the next morning we were instructed to fetch one in the street as \"they always come by\". Needless to say we had to drag our suitcases to the train station as no taxi would stop. We just caught our train and will never go back to Hotel Giolli.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Billerica, MA", "Title": "\u201cclean, safe, great location\u201d", "Author": "capt_nutso", "ReviewID": "UR5369372", "Content": "My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Hotel Giolli. Carlo welcomed us and provided much needed info on the city and it's people. The hotel was clean. The rooms are small by American standards, but most European hotel rooms are. It was still big enough for us - we weren't in Rome to spend time in our hotel room! The continental breakfast wasn't too great either, but again - it's par for the course. The hotels we stayed at in other Italian cities had very similar breakfasts. The best feature of the hotel is it's location. We walked to all the major sites in Rome from our hotel - the Colosseum, the forum, the Vatican, the Pantheon, the Trevi fountain,... it was great! Very close to Quarinale, Trevi, and Trajan's Market. I would highly recommend Hotel Giolli!", "Date": "June 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gulfport, Mississippi", "Title": "\u201c3 Stars\u201d", "Author": "gpd132", "ReviewID": "UR4521594", "Content": "Excellent value for the price. At the last minute we needed a hotel in the center. We checked with Hotel Reservations (yellow sign with black writing) at the Rome Termini train station. They arranged a room for us for 80 euro. The room was a nice size and clean. Bathroom was clean. Good water pressure and lots of hot water. The AC/Heater was not working so well but was not an issue. It was cold out and the heat only came on and did not adjust by the dial. Also the shower head was not working so I used the euro style hand held shower which worked great. The TV was small but you will not use it in Rome. Breakfast was typical continental and good. The staff was very friendly and held our bags after checkout so we could walk around. Much of the staff were foreigners, mostly Russians I think, and that may account for what some reviews take as being rude. I think their enlgish is not so good so maybe that is why, but I found them to be polite. It is very close to everything and yes, its better to walk than to go by vehicle, traffic is terrible at all times. There was street noise always but the location and price and cleanliness of the hotel overcame all the low points. I would recommend it for a few nites and would go back for sure.", "Date": "February 26, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Giolli Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d203198-Reviews-Giolli_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$121 - $251*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Nazionale 69</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "203198", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/20/6b/44/room-with-view-on-street.jpg"}}
