We checked in with a girl who spoke fantastic English, she wasn't overly friendly, but got the job done. (there were other members if staff who were more than happy to help us out). Our room was on the 6th floor with a huge bed (enough space for 4 people!), a small stand-out balcony and an incredibly powerful shower. At night you could hear traffic etc outside, but not nearly enough to keep you up, or wake you up. The hotel itself is slightly out of the centre of town, but no more than a 10 minute walk to the busy main streets of Passeig de Gracia and La Rambla, where you will find all the best restaurants and designer shops. (is also very easy access by train from the airport) The Sagrada Familia is also only 10-15 minutes walk from the hotel and a brilliant sight to see. There is also a zoo, maybe 40-45 minutes walk from the hotel, definitely worth a visit. It is possible to get a metro to all of these places, but with such beautiful weather and surroundings, we found it best to walk. The hotel lobby as a selection of leaflets etc, we found one with a map and we used it to plan our days, it was fantastic. The PortAventura theme park is also only 90 mins away and so easily accessible by train from Passeig de Gracia. We purely used the room as a base to shower and sleep and it was perfect for that. The bed was so comfortable and the bathroom provided more than enough amenities.

We were left alone to enjoy the city at our own pace. The only issue i have is that the room prices on easy to book are shown in Pounds and when you pay it is converted into Euros at a not very favorable rate so a 4 night stay was about \u00a325 more expensive than we anticipated. The hotel is away from the tourist centre of the Ramblas and is a little cheaper.

Quiet was of paramount importance and we got a room facing a school courtyard, which was great since school is out, and a view of the Sagrada Familia.

It was clean, each room had a toilet, sink & shower ensuite with shower gel, shower cap, toothbrush, toothpaste, soap & sponge provided - useful to know if you are taking hand luggage only. Each room has air con you can control, a tv (mainly Spanish!), haridryer and a fridge mini bar, with a desk & chair. The window opened which was nice to have some fresh air, and the rooms we had were at the back of the hotel which overlooked a childrens football pitch. There isnt a bar, pool, gym or anything but its a great base camp for being out & about in the city. I slept really well and found it quiet - other guests seemed to be mature and fairly quiet although one of my friends was next to some very excitable chatty girls who kept him awake. We didnt have breakfast as it was quite expensive even at discounted 9 euros - there are cafes nearby but we got bits from the supermarket opposite and had croissants etc in the room, there was spare space in the fridge for ham & cheese.. The only thing it lacked was tea making facilities which we British love, although one of my friends had a travel kettle with him! The area the hotel is in is residential and reasonably quiet, its not a main road although there are shops, cafes etc Its a short walk to the metro and within easy walking distance of the main town - its all flat and in blocks so you can follow a map fairly easily. I think if you wanted lively nightlife it s bit away from the action. The staff were very helpful & checking in & out was quick - just ask if you need anything - I borrowed an iron and got them to order a taxi and they were very efficient. Taxi to the airport was 33 euros. They were happy to store bags after checking out, until we picked them up later that evening. There is so much to see in Barcelona its hard to decide - we took a Tourist bus tour for orientation & to see the range of places to visit. The main Gaudi attractions are so popular and quite pricy that we decided to just do La Pedreira (fantastic!), and got up early to be first in the queue at 9am, if you leave it later the queue will be very long, same with Casa Batllo & Miro museum. Dont bother with the museum of modern art - it was a big building but there wasnt much to it. Parc Guell is great but very busy indeed & up a steep hill. We loved the Museu de ceramica which is out of the main centre, near the University, but also houses a textile museum & interiors museum in a fabulous building, cheaper & much less crowded but fascinating. We loved all the narrow streets in & around the Ramblas, Ribera & Barri Gottic, especially the big market with amazing food.

I had a single room (which is in fact a double room). very spacious and comfortable. the hotel staff are very friendly and gave me very details instructions to places that i want to go. they speak very good english which was very important to me. i did not take the breakfast from the hotel and instead opt for the cafes near the hotel. the cafe con leche and croissant or spanish omlette are something hard to forget. the hotel also offers free wifi. for about 65 euro per night, i am very happy with what i go. i will definately stay there again if i visit barcelona again.", "Date": "March 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cNice bathroom\u201d", "Author": "BookingNextTrip", "ReviewID": "UR23533535", "Content": "Room was a little on the small size for what we paid, although it did have a very nice bathroom and shower.

There is a metro station about 10 minutes walk from the hotel (Tetuan). The room is OK, but the bathroom a little strange with a glass door (between the room and the bathroom) that does not close very well...

Supermarkets and internet centers are walking distance. Las ramblas are a 20 minute walk from the hotel but I would highly recomend you take the turist bus for 48 hours it will only cost you 26 euros and it will give you the opportunity to visit all the main atractions for 48 hours, hop on and off all you like. Dont take the breakfast its too expensive considering that for the same amount of money you can have a beter breakfast outside the hotel.The hotel was a great experience but unfortunately my personal opinion is that barcelona lacks tourist attractions, most attractions only center themselves in Gaudi projects. For youg people that like to party its an excellent place due to the wide variety of discos and bars that offer Las Ramblas.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood price and good location\u201d", "Author": "Kazlet", "ReviewID": "UR11690449", "Content": "The Hesperia Carlit is conveniently located 5 minutes walk from the metro, and 15 minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia.

I would highly recommend this hotel, the staff were helpful and professional, and the facilites were nice too. Its not the Ritz, but it is surprisingly modern and well decorated. By the way, if you fly to Barcelona from Bristol with Ryanair, you dont land in Barcelona, you land in Varedero - a good hour - two hours away. there is a bus service from the airport, but it is not directly linked with Ryanair, so check if there will be a bus for you when your flight arrives.

There are several Metro stations near the hotel for those who would prefer not to waste time walking. The staff were very friendly and helpful and, despite our best efforts to speak Spanish, they spoke excellent English. The room was immaculate, we had aircon, an ensuite bathroom with a shower and our own balcony. My only issue with the hotel was that as breakfast was not included in our package, we had to pay for it... that would have been fine except that it cost 11 Euros per person, per day- which I think is a bit dear. There was a range of food on offer however, pastries, breakfast cereals, fruit and the like. Based on how you book the hotel perhaps you'll be lucky enough to have breakfast included in your package (then you won't notice how expensive it is!).

The bathroom was clean and quite large. The staff was also very helpful, and most of them spoke well english well enough to get along. We took the breakfast buffet one day, which was o.k., but we didn't really bother because we'd get some snacks during the day.

Our room had no external windows, and only a window onto the internal courtyard. This was fine with us, as the room was very quiet.
