It's definitely very easy to hear through the walls, but unless you're a light sleeper or a perfectionist that can be very easily overlooked considering the price of the rooms. Breakfast was okay, but the coffee was pretty awful. The area itself looks a little run down, but it's not the flea infested pit that some reviewers have described.

Neighbourhood scary, dirty and unsafe: dirty streets, many homeless people, be carefull: everywhere on the streets are dog's fences and trashes. It is about 20 minutes of rather quick walk from Termini: even during the day it is - walking along the Via Giolitti to Termini - hard experience. During the night or very early in the morning - only if desperated. The closest metro station is Manzoni: about 4-5 minutes of walk. But not nice after dark. Hotel: staff rather nice. Room was cleaned everyday, towels were changed too. And it is all about good sides. First but the most annoying disadvantage is that the walls are made probably from paper :). You can hear every single word from the rooms next to yours. You can hear, when other guests wake up, use the toilet or shover, watch tv or open the window. In my case there was at this time a school group - about 40 people, who completely turned my staying there in horror. Laughing, speaking really loud, walking between the rooms - for two nights I could not close my eyes, my kids of course too. Staff did not react. Third night I started to hit the wall and it helped, but only a little. Very loud flush in the toilet: you are affraid to use it at night, because it seems that all guests must wake up. On breakfast it were the rolls and horrible bread, 2 kind of hams, cheese, honey and jam. Cofee, juices, tea and some yogurts (disgusting) from machine. But it was hard to drink anything from it: when I saw, that the clean hot water from this machine is dirty yellow... I did not want to know, what was in cofee or juice. Staff did not clean the tables regulary. Of course, when I went for breakfast after the school group I have to wait for food, and often not everything was filled. Generally, after all my experiences (it would take too long to write it here) I would not recommend it in any case, maybe exceptionlly if you are teenage and you don't care about sleeping and eating. Maybe the cost are low, but when you go for hollidays you need to relax yourself and you have to be relaxed to walk for whole day. In my opinion in this hotel it is not possible.

It was important to us to be able to walk to the hotel from Termini Station even after dark - about 8:30pm. Pleased to say the walk was okay, took about 25 - 30 minutes with roller bags, but because street runs parallel to the tracks, we could feel the shadows watching us along the way. No problems though, we are happy to report. The man behind the desk at the hotel was efficient and did speak English, bonus for us. The room we were assigned was not a three star but everything worked in budget Italian fashion - small room, high cielings, long drapes, a recessed window, tiny bathroom, quiet. We asked about restaurants nearby and were given a couple of recommendations. Mmmm delicious - pasta in Rome with candlelight and red wine on a perfect evening - how can you get better than that? We were so happy from the fun at dinner that we overlooked any shortages in the hotel. Breakfast room was busy and although not outstanding, the food was adequate.

Unfortunately on this occasion that was not the case. When we booked the room we were made aware that we would be in the annex, this was not a problem to us, we were happy to walk to breakfast and if anything we thought it might be a bit quieter than the main hotel, how wrong we would be. When we arrived and checked in the two gentlemen behind the desk couldn't have been more friendly, they spent ages showing us all of the sites on a map, including transport links and recommendations of places to go and eat, this information proved to very accurate and invaluable, we used that map for our entire trip. We were then greated by the receptionist from the annex who collected us from the main reception and escorted us to the annex, she again was very friendly and recommended a restaurant for us to eat at just around the corner which ended up being the nicest and best value for money restaurant that we ate at. On first impression we were happy with our room, it was a good size with one double bed and bunk beds (we had booked a twin room) and an adequate sized bathroom with shower, we also had our own little terrace outside which we liked. There was a problem with our safe which we reported to the staff and they sorted out promptly. Unfortunately when we returned from a meal on the first evening and went to bed we found our main problem, our room was right next to the reception and the wall was very thin, probably only a partition wall, we could hear every person who came in and out all night and at 6am the recption staff changed shift and stood in the recption area talking loudly for over half an hour, eventually I had to go to reception in my pyjamas and ask them to be quiet, they apologised but continued to talk quietly and let the door slam on their way in and out. The second night was even worse, there were a group of male students staying in the upstairs rooms, they shouted laughed and moved furniture round until 2am when again I had to go to reception in my pyjamas to ask them to do something about it, then once we finally got to sleep at 6am we were woken again by the reception staff changing shift who seem to have forgotten all about my request from the night before for them to be quiet. By the morning we were very tired, two nights with poor sleep was ruining our trip as we were too tired during the day to make the most of our time here so I went to the main reception and complained. They eventually reluctantly agreed to move us to another room, although they were fairly unsympathetic and at no point did they ever apologise to us. We were moved to the second floor of the annex and I would like to say that was the end of the problem but we were put into a room right next door to the students and whilst it was a small improvement on being in the room underneath them the noise and the broken sleep continued, despite us purchasing ear plugs in the pharmacy! On the last night I had to open the door in my pyjamas yet again to ask 4 male students who were stood right outside of our door having a conversation to be quiet. The breakfast was also very disapointing, again I had read previous reviews on here regarding the quality of the breakfast so I wasn't expecting great things but for me the most annoying thing was that they would constantly run out of cups, plates,glasses, cutlery etc so even if there was any breakfast left after the teenagers had taken huge platefuls of food there was nothing to eat it or drink it from. Overall this hotel was very disapointing, yes the location was quite good for termini station and sight seeing and some of the staff were extremly friendly and helpful but this was about all it had going for it and the lack of sleep that we experienced over our 4 night stay ruined our overall enjoyment of the trip. It wasn't an expensive hotel, and believe me I am the first person to moan when people pay budget prices for hotel rooms and then complain on here because it wasn't the Ritz but I do not feel that this hotel represents good value for money and I would not stay here again.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide", "Title": "\u201cBit noisy, but not as bad as all the reviews say !\u201d", "Author": "Nybor123", "ReviewID": "UR118806165", "Content": "Very clean and comfortable.

We also had a few bad experiences with noisy guests but this was rectified by the receptionist. Breakfast was by far the worst we have ever experienced, with only a selection of two cereals, milk, bread (not toast), rolls (hard) and ham and cheese. There is a hot drinks and a juice machine. The staff only appear to clear the tables and fill up the food and plates. Because the selection of food and plates was so small, it quickly run out and the guests soon became like vultures fighting for the food. On the plus side, the hotel is situated approx 15 mins walk on the same road as Termini, the main train station which did provide us with excellent access to the train station. Be wary of getting a taxi from the station to the hotel as we were greatly overcharged and taken on a tour of the center!

Location: The Hotel is located ov via Giolitti, 10 minutes walk from Romes train station Termini. From the airport there is the Leonardo Express train, 20 minutes non-stop for 11 Euros. The area is typical train station area, not too good, and lots of Graffiti. But we never felt unsave although we walked back to the hotel every night. There are two underground stations closeby and lots of buses and trams. In 15 minutes you are at every sight. Hotel: The hotel consists of two buildings, quite old but very well maintained. The lobby looks very nice, hotel was speaking basic english and was very friendly. There are two vending machines with water, drings and snacks in the lobby. The breakfas room was in the basement, breakfast was included in our rate. For italian standards it was very good, sausages, cheese, white bread, marmelade and butter. Cerials and two machines, one for coffee (we did lot like it) and juices. But we did not care, there are plenty of cafes around for good coffee. Room: Our room 237 was on 2nd floor with a view of a silent back street. Room was small but very clean. Comfortable bed and a small bathroom with a perfect shower. Strong water pressure and all amenities. There was also aircondition but we did not need it. At the last day we could put our luggage in a locked luggage room until we left for the airport. Tipps: We bought a Rome pass before we went to Rome. With it most sights can be visited for free. Also got a 3 day pass for public transport, highly recommend that. The best is, to walk around a lot, most sights are in pedestian areas. Be careful, some restaurants, especially in downtown area around Fontana di Trevi rip you off. We found some very nice restaurants in TRAVESTERE area. This is a district with lots of small bars and restaurants where he local people eat. Pizzas from 4 Euro, had gread fish for less than 50 % compared to downtown. Great area to wlak around, real italian atmosphere with little streets and shops. Overall: We would stay there again and recommend it to everybody not expecting a luxury hotel. It was definitively worth the money.

We felt very safe walking between the Hotel and the Colosseum - taking in the sights, smells and savouring some delicious pastries along the way. There was a choice of restaurants around the corner from the hotel for Dinner and we were not disappointed with our selection (suggested by the concierge). Our hotel room was just beautiful.

Yes, the bathroom was small but lovely (much smaller shower than we're used to but no problems here). We even had a small tv in our room.

However, we walked this path several times very late at night and during the daylight and did not feel particularly unsafe. The area is populated and there are a handful of restaurants & shops along the street. This is obviously a lower end commercial district without much residential population. Location aside, the hotel is charming. We stayed in room 231. We had a very high ceiling (nice to muffle noise) and a lovely view of a courtyard (a bit under-repaired). The room was mostly quiet (but you did hear the trains going down the tracks a block or so away). We had a full size bed (a rarity in Europe) and the bathroom was recently updated. The shower was tiny. Probably only 4 foot by 4 foot square. Our room had two plug-in outlets (one in the bathroom, one by the bedside). The TV was very small and only carried Italian language stations. We suspect the hot water situation has a great deal to do with when you shower. We had no problem with hot water in the evening, before 7:30 in the AM or after 9:30 in the AM. We did find the lukewarm water to be a problem when we got up at 8:30 AM.

We don't speak Italian. They made it very clear that Americans are not welcome and will be treated like garbage. The hotel that we had to stay in was a filthy matchbox with leaky toilets, twin size fold up beds, and no telephones in the rooms. And the bathrooms were almost in-room port-o-lets with two-feet square showers.Please do not endorse this practice by advertising for them.", "Date": "November 30, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianola, Washington", "Title": "\u201cClean, but not as expected as per description\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1492774", "Content": "Arrival: Easy walk from train station. A clean facility with pretty entry and breakfast room. The tv had quite a few channels, but not one in English. There was a phone in the room with instructions to call using Visa. Could not even call the desk on it. Clerk, when asked how to make a call, stated \"Oh, it doesn't work. It is best to go to the Termini (train station) to make a call\". This was at night and not a very good neighborhood. The day clerk did know how to do it! No drinking cups at all in room. Shower head fell off in my hand. The description states the hotel is just behind the Piazza Vittorio, actually it was at least a 20 minute walk. Breakfast consisted of Orange juice, coffee hard rolls and a few bisquits.", "Date": "November 19, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Tempio Di Pallade", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d281806-Reviews-Tempio_Di_Pallade-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$79 - $182*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "281806", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9c/17/9c1704647ce95a8d4022b8c09321fc083large.jpg"}}
