Unique and beautiful interior with above average service. Room is very clean and spacious. Location of the hotel is not bad, only a few mins walk to metro station (if you are going to Universal Studio, the easiest way is taking the metro heading North Hollywood direction for 2 stops and there is free studio shuttle tram taking you to the theme park.) and about 20 to 25 mins walk to Highland Center and Kodak Theater. Be aware if you book their Highland Flats type room, you will be sleeping beside a night club and you WILL hear and feel the music base all night long. My husband couldn't fall asleep till 5 in the morning for the first night and he had to use ear plugs for the other two nights. If you are a light sleeper, spend more money and book the more expensive room that is facing the court yard instead. Also there are no view from this room type. We are on the 5th floor (the top floor) and all we can see from the window and balcony is the concrete side wall of the night club next door. Another complain I got is the water pressure of their rain shower head. the water pressure was so weak that i feel like I can never wash off the bubbles on me. The kitchen inside the room is amazing. There is an actual stove you can cook on and the pot and pan are all prepared for you. Living room is large and comfy, and I love the turntable record player. We played it every night before sleep and in the morning when we were getting ready. This is our first wedding anniversary trip and I wish it could be more perfect, but sadly the night club ruined it for us.

The room: Very nice, the room was as it appears in the photographs, large and roomy. The bed was soooooo comfortable as was the bedding and pillows. The bathroom was large as was the shower, but there was too little pressure in the rain shower head that the water barely dribbled out. I did ask for the room to be away from the nightclub nearby, but we were situated on the same street and it did get very noisy late at night, not so much from the music but from the clientele of the club outside while lining up to get in and when leaving the club. We had a balcony which faced Vine Street and a view of Capitol Records. A continental breakfast was included in our booking, but not worth it as it only included a coffee and a piece of toast or a muffin. There is a house car which we took advantage of for a trip to Universal Studios and a trip to the open air mall. The staff: The staff were nice, particularly Ellis who was lovely, very helpful and obliging and very polite. Location: I was concerned at the location before booking as it was a 10-15 minute walk to most hotels and restaurants and all the action but booked anyway based on reviews that the distance was no biggie. The 15 minute walk did grow a bit old very quickly, particularly after walking and touring all day and then venturing out again for dinner. More particularly at night when walking back and there were a couple of undesirable looking groups of people wandering about.

Place to drink: 'Five 0 Four' bar on Hollywood Blvd Tip: Take one of the open topped van tours around Beverley Hills and Rodeo Drive, a bit kitschey but a lot of fun Conclusion: While we liked the Redbury, I probably wouldnt stay there again, I would probably look at the Renaissance Hotel or the Roosevelt Hotel for a more central location for convenience only.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cFantastic rooms, pleasant , but confused front desk\u201d", "Author": "glu", "ReviewID": "UR126944061", "Content": "The Redbury is perfectly located at Hollywood and Vine! A stroll down the street puts you right in all the kitschy Hollywood action. The decor is a very lush with a hint of musk in the air. The rooms are spacious flats with a well stocked kitchen, wide kitchen bar, funky furniture and a great mattress. The valets were the nicest, most helpful young men, especially when we misplaced our cell phone. The front desk staff was extremely pleasant, but were clueless regarding the package we had booked. We are part of the I Prefer group-which is the reason we chose the Redbury. The front desk totally bungled our room type, our rate, our included breakfast, and early check-in/late check-out benefits. After several different clerks, and multiple phone calls, it all was fixed, but exhausted us. Then our room had a broken clock, broken safe, a non-functioning deadbolt, and a set of blinds that fell on my son's head. Room service was noted to be 24 hours, but you could not order your breakfast the night before. And when we tried to order at 7 am, no one was in to take the order!?! Our food arrived promptly, but without napkins. All of this was fixed with each front desk call, but we began to worry that the hotel was more focused on the trendy look, rather than good service. After the first 24 hours, the remainder of the stay was without a hitch, until the bill came and charged us for our free internet. It was promptly corrected.

We stayed in the 'base' flat (not sure what one?) and it was really spacious! It is open concept with the only door being a sliding door that separates the toilet from the rest of the bathroom (which was actually nice for 3 women sharing / trying to all get ready at the same time!). We did have to call the front desk a few times as the toilet kept getting clogged with nothing but toilet paper or kleenex in it. The shower also had a glass wall that faced the bed, which could be weird depending on who you're staying with! The record player was great and a really fun feature. I also LOVED the decor and the art was all very interesting. The kitchen had just what we needed - a sink, a few burners, a lot of counter space, and lots of drinking glasses. The mini bar was not so mini! We didn't take anything, but it was reasonably priced (I actually think the $7 Heineken was more expensive at a restaurant we went to!). There were only 2 coffees (keurig - yum!) so we called the front desk and they brought us up more right away, and the cleaning staff refilled it with 3 which was nice. There was not, however, any laundry soap. We probably could have just asked for it but we decided not to bother as we were just getting ready to go out for the day. The King bed was SUPER comfortable (which I shared with my mom) and we got a cot brought up for my sister. So not ideal sleeping situation for 'non couples' but we made it work. We had a spacious balcony (for a hotel room) that overlooked the courtyard, which was nice as my mom is a smoker. It DID get quite loud at night so if you can't sleep with background noise than this might bother you. I bring earplugs when I travel so I used those and had no problem sleeping. My mother and sister didn't have earplugs but still slept no problem. It was like having the radio on as you fall asleep... :) The staff was really friendly, the location was good (about a 10-15 minute walk to Hollywood and Highland / Grauman Theatre etc) and just around the corner from Pantages Theatre. If you want to have a true Hollywood experience, then stay here!

Of course all this comes at a price (overnight parking is $37!) and the rooms come at around $320-$350 a night, but in a way it is excellent value for money and nothing here is done on the cheap. There is even a washing machine hidden away in one of the cupboards. The one draw back is perhaps the noise. Avoid the rooms that give onto the club next door on the North side.

I got the 2 bedroom suite and boy was is huge! Its true... size does matter. But not only was the size of the room amazing but the decor was chic. Leather sofas, flat panels in every room, king and queen size beds that were ultra comfortable. The record player was a nice touch but was skipping when I first turn it on. I quick call to the host desk and they immediately sent someone to fix it. Service. Service at Redbury is probably the highest reason why I was so please with my stay. I am not a night owl nor do I know any hollywood nightlife. So I relied a little bit on the hotel on their recommendations. First of, they recommended a restaurant called Saint Felix, which was absolutely fabulous, when the restaurant below couldn't accommodate our party. Then knowing that it could be difficult to get around and get in at some of the venues, I again turned to the hotel hosts (one of which was TJ who was the most accommodating) and ask for suggestions and they gave me some recommendations and they made some calls and they got my group in with serious VIP treatment. My boys were out for a good time to spend a night with a certain gentleman who will be taking his vows to be with the woman he loves. Redbury made the difference and made it a night that we will always remember.

Leaving the hotel with a very handy map and directions of how to reach the nearest CVS and supermarket (Trader Joe\u2019s) I was on my way. From the hotel it is a very easy walk into Hollywood to see the sights and have access to an abundance of tour companies to take you further on your sightseeing desires. There is a Trader Joe\u2019s down from the hotel on Vine Street where you can buy delicious fresh food to fill up your mini fridge and cupboards. The Redbury doesn\u2019t have its own spa; however, it is a quick 5-minute walk to the Bliss Spa attached to the W hotel and that is a great spa for a few hours of pampering. The house car is a blessing and I used it over two days to take me to the Beverly Centre and The Grove. They don\u2019t usually do pick up, but you can ring the hotel and if the car is not busy they will pick you up for a return trip which I was very lucky enough to secure on one of my days. Otherwise there is an abundance of taxis around to bring you back to the hotel, but be warned very few know where the hotel is and will ask you for the address so have it handy!

A sitting area and balcony, mine had a view of Capital Records, comfy bed, great sized bathroom and shower and a washing machine/dryer which I found to be very handy as a traveller with limited clothing selections and a stay of 5 nights. The only downside I found with the hotel is the street noise it really is an issue. I used the knowledge of other reviewers and asked for a quite room away from the nightclub, which stopped the thumping music noise; however, the street noise once the nightclub has closed rages on past 3am in the morning. I was on the third floor facing Vine Street and the street noise was terrible, perhaps it might be a little better if you have a higher floor or are facing away from the street. I returned one evening to the nightclub ablaze with flashing police lights and an extended police presence. The nightclub was closed for whatever reason after the police presence and what a difference in the street noise! I had two uninterrupted nights of sleep. Great hotel with excellent service and friendly staff who are knowledgeable about the surrounding areas and are more than happy to help you in anyway they can. Downside is the terrible street noise!

The rooms are spacey; 750sqft minimum for each room as the property was originally built to be condo units. Great amenities from washer/dryers in each room, 2 flat screens per room, available complimentary I-Pad uses, amongst a plethora of other great treats & treasures. In it's first year of opening, prices were much more reasonable; as of late, the price increases seem to be a little much but the quality of rooms & service still makes it one of the best values in LA. The off-putting things about this property are that room service comes from the in-house restaurant Cleo and next door's Katsuya (both great restaurants); both charge a delivery fee in addition to the hefty gratuity which is odd since Cleo is in-house? I can order to-go, travel down 5 floors (the hotel is only 5 stories total so it's not far no matter which floor your room is on) and just bring it up to my room rather than pay that delivery fee: it's more like a \"if-you-are- -too-lazy-to-come-get-it-yourself-expect-to-be-charged\" type of fee. The ice-machine is a pain; there is only 1 ice-machine located on the 4th floor but I consider a small price to pay for traveling through the hallways in discovery of neat features this hotel has to offer. Quiet sleepers beware: the property sits next to Avalon Nightclub which is known for their ongoing heavy bass electronic music after-hour parties (yes low frequency bass waves travel through walls): Friday & Saturday nights this club will go strong until after the sun comes up which should be more of a reason why they should consider keeping the prices slightly lower for the weekend because if you are stuck on the Avalon side of the building you might not be getting much sleep or if your neighbor in the room next door just so happens to be that world famous DJ that just got off his set from the club and decides to continue the party in their room for the night. Since it's opening the hotel has done an excellent job in keeping it's cleanliness but with so much detail involved you can see a little wear starting to show finally. A chipped tile in the shower; scuff marks on some of the hallway and room walls but nothing to complain over since again, the value of this property is still one of the best deals in LA. Small renovations every year should be mandatory given then amount of detail and traffic this place sees. Overall, the best times to truly enjoy this property is on the week-day nights when their aren't so many party-goers involved; walking through the dark halls provides a plush but eerie feeling of being transported to a different time and place where you'll be more than satisfied that you have this place to yourself for the night.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cSpacious and good design\u201d", "Author": "sdcdd", "ReviewID": "UR121704896", "Content": "Stayed here for several days with two teenage daughters.

It's like being in a Scotch-sipping private members club of yesteryear. I read that a renowned photographer helped design the place and it shows -- the lighting is perfect! My room (The Hollywood Premiere Flat) was also pleasantly different. It's designed like an apartment, complete with open-plan kitchen, washer-dryer, large four-poster bed and lounge area. There's a walk-in shower and large vanity area. The balcony has a nice view. My favorite touches included the very-well stocked kitchen (food and alcoholic beverages amongst other things) and the old fashioned record player with its assortment of twelve-inch records!

The rooms also have very good sound-proofing - you couldn't hear the faintest murmur of my party from outside in the hallway! I would most certainly stay here again.

Ellis took the time to ask what our plans for the next few days were, then suggested and arranged a hire car for us to drive ourselves around.

Suzanna helped steer us in the right direction for some amazing outlet shopping not too far out, and was always very friendly and welcoming. Location wise.. Brilliant!

A metro station, Trader Joes, a decent Coffee shop (at least the best I found in Hollywood) and no shortage of restaurants, and bars.

I vacillate between anger at my horrible customer service experience and actual ways the hotel can improve so this review will try to be as levelheaded and fair as I can make it. I hope that the good and bad will be taken as ways they can improve their service in the future! Let's start off with the good! The Good: -Beautifully decorated and huge! A real rock star meets old Hollywood vibe.The smallest is 750 square feet! The bed was soft and comfortable! -There is a DVR in each room so I was able to tape my normal shows and watch them in my vacation downtime! -Location Location Location! It is a one minute walk to the Hollywood and Vine metro station and only a block away from Trader Joe's! -Delicious smelling lotion and shower gel! The Bad: The Cleaning Crew. The maid service times were very sporadic! One day it was finished by 10:00 am other days it hadn't been started by 4:00 pm. I'm quite sure my sheets were not changed every day and the last three days I was missing a top sheet! Other than that the one time I was in the room while she was cleaning-she was efficient and courteous. Individual Coffee Machines. -I understand these are popular nowadays...but really! A six ounce cup of coffee had been almost drained by the time I went to enjoy it on the balcony. I know I used at least 3 coffee pods every morning. A coffee maker would be a lot easier and much more economical! Speaking of coffee... I requested splenda and coffee pods everyday from the cleaning staff (underneath the note I left a generous daily tip) and everyday it was ignored (even though they sure didn't forget the tip) LOL I had to go get the coffee pods myself from Cleo and the front desk every few days. Just a suggestion... only having Bold and Decaf is not the way to go! There are entirely too many flavors to only offer sleepy time tea, decaf and bold coffee! The Bathroom -The rain shower is nice and all if you don't mind the lack of water pressure but the water never got steamy hot...more like luke warm. (I was in 312) -The sink is one of those really sleek flat ones that looks like it needs to be a prop in a sexy commercial. It's completely flat with small beveled edges.Would have been perfect for doing a line of coke in a music video. Not actually conducive for washing your face or brushing your teeth! My room not ready or properly checked! -The day I checked in they hadn't itemized the room properly and as I was unpacking two men (they were quite apologetic) came into the room to check out the minibar and such. -I had to return a DVD that someone had left in the DVD player. There was a vinyl record missing from one of the covers and an open bottle of your water sitting one of the end tables by the couch. Technical Issues! -The lighting system is ridiculous! Every night around 3 am the pot lights over the bed would come on and wake me up. I finally figured out how to fix it...after almost a week of staying there. Not to mention you need a diagram to keep track of all the light switches and what they turn on and off. At least 4 different sets in the kitchen and living room alone! The DVR and remote is way too complicated to work-and I'm a bit of a techie. It's one of those universal remotes and it's just confusing! (see picture) No Car Service as stated on the Website! -The car service...(one of the reasons why I booked The Redbury) was not available. That was a bit annoying but I was told that they would give me a voucher for a cab. Not exactly what I was hoping for decked out to the nines to go to a red carpet event but I didn't have much of a choice. Well I gave them the time and date I would need the cab and I get to the front desk and when I arrived they had no record of it. Sigh:( Luckily the cab company was \"right around the corner\" and it literally took a few minutes to get to Graumans theater but I ended up paying for the cab myself. The floor to ceiling Windows must come with a disclaimer! -Just a note for the single traveler and non exhibitionist couples...The white sheer shades that filter light so beautifully during the day...are completely transparent at night. I realized (around day five) (when the hotel filled up a bit more) that I could see entirely inside the rooms across the courtyard from me. Like everything! Yes, I'm talking to you certain couple. If there was a light on at all-I could see straight into the room. Please let people know that they might want to draw the black out drapes at night in the rooms facing the courtyard. I wish I would have realized this before traipsing around my room in my underwear or reenacting the entire end scene from West Side Story. (don't ask) A Billing Snafu Times Two (or Three) -The staff tried to charge me twice for internet access even though the terms of my booking offered \"FREE INTERNET\" -It took three weeks and a call to their billing department for them to release the 1050 (150 a day for a week ) hold on my card. They were apologetic about it but the excuse was that \"sorry that week hadn't been batched out properly\" -My last billing issue was the straw that broke the proverbial camels back! The Management! UGH! I was locked out of my room on a very early Saturday morning after being at a film fest for almost 16 hours. Long story short. (lol too late?) The manager was rude and treated me like a criminal. I told him that I had been billed that previous Wednesday for the entire amount of my stay (almost 1800 dollars total) and that I had checked my credit card balance that morning like I always do. He said their computer system didn't have any record of it and asked to see proof. (Really? Wow! What happened to the customer is always right?) I had to call my credit card company at 1:00am for them to say... Yes, I had been billed the full amount even though the hotel's computer was showing otherwise. The manager wasn't even apologetic! One faulty computer system and a very tired and embarrassed me later.... I finally got back into my room. The next day I considered leaving-but I figured the refund would be more hassle than it was worth. I even saw that same manager coming out of the Cleo restaurant the next day and he just looked right through me. The management was terrible, and if that situation had been handled with a bit more finesse I wouldn't have left with such a bad taste in my mouth! I expect MORE customer service at a smaller boutique hotel... not less! That manager really cast a pall on what would have been a lovely vacation and first time to Hollywood. On the bright side...all the front desk attendants were nice as they could be. I just wish things would have been handled differently! Well, that was my honest Redbury experience. I still have yet to receive a return email from management which makes me think that due to the amount of glowing reviews they just don't care about the few people who really had some major customer service issues! I hope this is not the norm and I my email was lost or something. Hope you can make an informed decision from this. Customer service is paramount to me so as a consumer you have to decide if style is worth more than substance! The bottom line?

And the Vinyl player in the room was especially cute. The bathroom had a very large shower and again, was very clean! The room also had a huge kitchen and washing machine & dryer. Now, to the cons. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT get their basic room. On the first visit, we got a room with the capitol record view. It's pretty much a view of the street which was fine for us. We loved sitting on our balcony and watching the passing traffic and people. However, on our second visit, we decided to save some money and get their basic room. What a Big Big mistake. The room faces a dirty alleyway, opposite a concrete wall which appears to be the outside of the club. Not only was it super loud, it was also very smelly on the balcony. Our room is probably not even a couple of meters across the concrete wall which makes the whole place feel depressing and claustrophobic. We desperately wanted to change room but the hotel was fully booked. So we sucked it up, kept our curtains closed day and night and checked out the next morning. Service: The service at The Redbury was very mediocre. The workers weren't rude or anything but they didn't seem to make that much of an effort. Other: The valet parking was expensive, but I think it's like this in most hotels in LA. We had Japanese room service on one night, small quantity, very average food and extremely overpriced! There is also no fitness centre on site. i think you can get a free pass to a public gym which is very inconvenient. Location wise, I think it was great for us (We are in our early twenties) but it's definitely not a place for family with kids or people who just wants to relax. It can get a little bit dodgy at night. Overall, the hotel didn't wow us.

It was also great to be able to go out to where we needed to go and walk and not worry about drinking and driving or getting a car service or cab. If you have a party at one of the clubs in this part of town then this is a great place to stay. The one knock on this place in my opinion is the neighborhood itself. Despite the city's attempt to clean up this part of town it can still be a bit gritty especially at night. I would not recomend this place for families. Also the cleaning crew had not swept off the balcony from the last guest and there were cigarette butts and ashes so we had to call to get that cleaned. They did come quickly and took care of it however after we called I must say. If staying here I would definatly recomend a walk down the street for dinner at the legendary Musso and Frank.

Our one-night stay at The Redbury met our requirements with some caveats. We're glad we tried it. CITY GRIT: Accept that in this part of Hollywood, you're always within six giant steps of something grungy. Between The Redbury and scrumptious Juicy Burger or the Pantages, expect to step in a little pee and expect a couple of requests for a buck or a smoke, both within acceptable levels of city gritty. That said, even if you didn't book a view room (see CHEAPEST ROOM), you shouldn't have to expect in-your-face grit when you sit on your balcony. It felt like we could reach out and touch the adjacent Avalon, with its crumbling fa\u00e7ade and stinky, noisy ally. Hey, Redbury - how about collaborating with the Avalon for a quick pressure wash and paint job? No? How about something well within your means to mitigate: (1) Add two more privacy panels to the two already hanging on the balcony and (2) clean up the pigeon poop on the balcony floor every now and again. CAB-RIDE CLOSE: This is a terrific base for concerts and theatre. The house ride was available when we were ready to head out to a concert at the Greek. Superior. GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP: No complaints about the mattress or linens, nor did we experience the noise others did, possibly because we stayed on Sunday night. The too-low lighting and the bed's platform\u2026 not a match made in heaven, and I have the bruises to prove it. Redemption came in the form of superb quality blackout curtains on the windows and roller blind on the patio door. Nighty-night, sleep tight! CHEAPEST ROOM: Having booked the smallest size suite AND requesting super-early check-in the morning after a sell-out, I got exactly what I expected (thus the ugly balcony scene). The great thing for the budget-minded is that but for the balcony and square footage (ours was 700+ - who needs more?) the experience (amenities, service) is pretty even across the board. Queue up a little Dark Side of the Moon on the easy-to-use turntable, crank up the AC and the well-positioned ceiling fan, poke through the ample snack baskets, and settle in for some pre-event R&R. Every staff interaction - with valets, house car driver, front desk staff, barista - resulted in engaged, efficient service. NOVEL VIBE: With the exception of the front entry area and Cleo, this is a relentlessly dark space, with deep browns, reds, and blacks competing to dominate dimly-lit public spaces, and in so doing, hiding some really nice appointments and people (gosh, sorry, didn't see you sitting there in your black t-shirt on that brown couch under that 10-watt bulb). And where was the genius hand that dressed Cleo when it came time to do the suites? You know your suite is dark when even the long expanse of butcher block, glossy white kitchen cabinets, and crisp white bed linens can't make a dent. Unmitigated murk is a novel vibe, and we enjoyed it for a little while. Try it for a night.

Now, while we were looking to go out and sample the nightlife in Hollywood, we didn't want it in our room! I had brought ear plus with me, as staying downtown, I assumed that there would be some traffic noise. However, ear plugs cannot drown out the bass noise of loud dance music. We tried for about half an hour to get to sleep, but it was no good. We then had to get dressed and go to the hotel reception. There we were told that they could do nothing to help us, we could potentially upgrade, but at considerable cost and not that night. I was very upset, as this was supposed to be a swanky hotel and give us a great start to a special holiday. We contacted Expedia who we had booked the hotel with, and they were brilliant. They liased with the hotel and ensured that we were refunded for the rest of our stay, we booked out the next morning and checked in to the Beverley Hilton instead.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lakeland, florida", "Title": "\u201cWas looking for a \"nonchain\" experience.

The advantage of the room location however was that it was away from the potentially noisy nightclub next door. Subdued lighting seems to be part of the overall design of the hotel. Attractive hallways and reception area in deep burgundy colour with large illuminated portraits of classic Hollywood starlets at the ends of the corridors . Our flat was large and well appointed with amenities and technology including mood lighting. Went to the trendy Cleo restaurant one night for dinner which was very nice with predominantly great mezza style food and very good service. Breakfast was basic, but the granola was very good.

He said, \"It's the coolest new place hands down!\" We ended up finding a great deal on Hotels.com... $209 per night for the highland flat I believe it was called. We were happy to have found a deal, and excited to check this place out! We left for LA earlier than we had planned so I called ahead to find out when check-in was and to then make sure our room would be ready by the 3:30 check-in time... We were assured that it would be. When we arrived at 4:00, we were told that our room was not ready and that we could wait in the library or on the couch in the \"lobby\" (more appropriately called a dark corner in front of the elevator), neither of which being inviting places to sit and wait. After a few long minutes I began to become aggravated, considering I did call ahead and was told our room was ready. I went back up to the front desk to ask if ANY room was available. After fumbling around on the computer and asking someone for help, the front desk guy gave us keys for a different room on the 4th floor. We were told that we were given an \"upgrade\" because apparently the room that we were originally getting was going to be on the 3rd floor. I don't see how this mattered because when we got to our room we discovered that our windows faced a brick wall looking down to a trash ridden alley way. Although not ideal, this was something that we could have handled as we could draw the sheer drapes and not worry about the view... We weren't planning to spend too much time in the room during daylight hours anyway. What we couldn't handle was the nauseating stench of cigarette smoke that gave me an instant headache. I specifically requested a non-smoking room when I booked our reservation, and when I called down to ask to switch rooms I was told that this was a non-smoking hotel, but that if we came back down they would get us switched to a different room. We then lugged all of our stuff back down to the front desk, never once offered a bellmen or any assistance with our baggage, and were given another key to a room on the 4th floor. \"Ok, whatever... Shake it off!\", we were thinking. We had dinner reservations and then tickets to a show after that. We just wanted to enjoy the rest of our one night stay in LA. We had reservations at Katsuya, which is literally a half of a block from the hotel, and also owned/operated by the SBE group. Dinner was great, but we regretted not having dinner at the Redbury's own Cleo restaurant... We heard nothing but great things about the dining experience there. Anyway, the rest of our night was great. We returned to the hotel around 11pm. We were happy, tipsy and ready to pass out. The beds were extremely comfortable... Beautiful pillows and linens. The rooms have a very homey feel, set-up more like an apartment than a hotel room. We fell right asleep and got approximately 2 hours of great sleep. Unfortunately, this was short lived as we were awoken around 1:30am by the loud thumping of music. We turned the TV on to try to drown out the music and eventually fell back into a restless, unfulfilling sleep. We were up at 8am the next morning kinda groggy and ready for a good coffee and hearty breakfast, but were again disappointed to find that the hotel didn't really offer much more than a continental breakfast. We decided to just pack up and check out... We'd grab something to eat at Waffle's which is great and just a few blocks away. So, upon check-out we were giggling because we saw one of the guys from the Travel Channel show \"Ghost Adventures\" which I like to watch before going to bed at night. He and his wife, with newborn baby in tow, were complaining to the front desk because he said that someone came into his room at 7:30am to take stock of the records for the record player in the room. He thought it was highly unusual and very disturbing at that hour. The girl that was helping us check-out was listing to their conversation and inadvertently re-charged us for our room, which was already paid for in full. Whatever - She apologized, reversed the charges and we were outta there. In short, the Redbury is in a great location, right off the 101 on Hollywood and Vine. It has a hip, funky vibe with dark crimson walls and giant illuminated pictures of starlets from the 40's and 50's... Not my style, but I'm sure it would appeal to others. The rooms are large and equipped like apartments with kitchenettes and washing machines. The restaurant, Cleo, is said to be very good. The layout of the hotel is kind of bizarre... No real lobby besides a cut-out of the wall at the top of the stairs. The staff and level of service is lacking, but I do believe that they have potential. Would I recommend the Redbury to a friend?

I hate almost everything about that vapid city. Unfortunately, I work in TV so that necessitates travel to Loathe Angeles several times a year. Double unfortunately, we mostly have to stay in Hollywood. That being said, the Redbury makes all those things more than bearable. First off the rooms are huge. We stayed in the smallest room available and it was 750 sqft. Giant kitchen, living room and a super comfortable bed with awesome sheets. The hotel itself is trendy and super designy but not in an obnoxious way. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful making us feel right at home. We normally stay at the W Hollywood across the street and while the rooms are nice there, the hotel as a whole is so sceney and obnoxious that every time you walk in the door you have to show your key and the doormen look you up and down. Not so at Redbury. It's just a super cool, low key (for now) place to call home when you are in LA. The food at Cleo's is awesome too. While the drinks are expensive, they are delicious. I highly recommend the Clemintina. I miss it. We also managed to get a stupendous rate, which I hope will not change much for our future travels. Are there some glitches...yes...the rooms aren't dark (as some other reviewers have mentioned) it's just that finding all the light switches is a little difficult. It took us about 5 minutes when we walked in to figure out where all the switches were and how to turn them on. And, yes, it can get a little noisy. The first night we were there the club next door was pretty loud. Luckily, the noise stopped at around midnight and our jetlag lulled us to sleep. There's no doubt in my mind (if the rates stay the same) this will be the only place I rest my weary head when I am reluctantly dragged in to the city of devils.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "WA", "Title": "\u201c\u201cMany A Slip Between The \u201cde-cafe\u201d Cup and the Lip\u201d.\u201d", "Author": "PerthMovers", "ReviewID": "UR92749101", "Content": "My Grandfather use to say, \u201cThere\u2019s many a slip between the cup and the lip.\u201d It means I think, just when you think you\u2019ve sealed the deal something goes wrong to upset it. The Redbury Hotel on Hollywood and Vine at the moment falls under this truism. My wife and I spent 10 nights at the Redbury over the Christmas/New Year holiday. We chose the hotel based solely on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor. We read with anticipation about the \u201cexciting and eclectic d\u00e9cor.\u201d The \u201chip and funky beat of the place\u201d all of which to a greater or lesser extent (depending on your point of view) are true. But after your eyes adjust to the soupy cool darkness of the room you begin to notice the first of many slips \u201cbetween cup and lip.\u201d The room we had was on the 5th floor and can best be described as New York loft meets LA bravado. On the wall is a clock last seen in one of two locations either around the neck of \u201cFlavour Flav\u201d or tucked uncomfortably into the breast pocket of The Mad Hatter. Right away you know that this place is trying hard to be something different. But what is it trying to be that is the question? Is it a hotel? Well no, not yet. Not a 5-star one. Most people after they have dropped their bags in the room, had a look at the bathroom, switched on the TV and bounced up and down on the bed a few times (purely as a means of testing comfort level) then turn their attention to information. Information on the hotel, the location, hotel restaurants, hotel breakfast facilities, important telephones numbers (ie how to contact housekeeping) and the like. There is not a single scrap of information in the room that pertains to any of this. And when you ask why this is, the answer you are given is quote \u201cWe are working on an I-Pad that guests can hire in the future that will have that information on it\u201d. Most 5-star properties have already beaten Apple founder Steve Jobs to this technical issue with old fashioned \"I-Paper\" in booklet form with the information written in it (Slip number 1) Slip number 2: (and the most important as far as my wife is concerned). When you ask the question after 4 days, \u201cHow often is the bed linen changed?\u201d You are told matter of factually \u201cevery 5 days\u201d \u201cOh, but it can be changed sooner if you ask\u201d Ask? Why should I have to ask? Again, most 5-star have this one sorted too. If you want your bed changed on a particular day, you place a little card on the bed. If you don\u2019t, then you simply leave the card off. Every 5 days is not what I would consider the definition of a 5-star hotel! A serviced apartment yes. A 5 star no. If the Redbury wish to pitch themselves in the serviced apartment market that\u2019s fine (but I doubt it), and if it is, let perspective guests know. Also, as stated above, hotel information guide in the room would inform you of this. Slip number 3: De-cafe coffee. I know that LA see itself as the health and body beautiful capital of the world. You only have to listen to the ads for huge burgers paradoxically followed by laxative commercials on TV to know how serious they are about it. However, despite repeated requests to reception for some real coffee, every time we returned to our room there they were. Like a scene from Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cThe Birds\u201d. De-cafe coffee pods multiplying at an alarming and malevolent rate. Eventually a note to housekeeping written in blood did the trick. Slip number 4: The House Car: We were told that the house car was available to take us on short local trips to say The Farmers Market or Beverly Centre et-al. In the 10 days of our stay the house car wasn\u2019t available once (no matter what time we asked). It was either \u201cout\u201d, \u201cnot sure what time it was due back\u201d or towards the end of our stay (and my favourite) \u201cin for service.\u201d If you are going to offer this \u201cservice\u201d to guests and one car isn\u2019t sufficient to meet demand- buy a second one. Slip number 5: A General Air of Detachment from Guests. Now this is only a personal opinion, my take on the ambience of the place. Nobody was rude. Nobody was offensive. Our questions were answered in an efficient and professional manner. But there was no warmth. The place is new, hip, funky (do people still say funky?) and \u201cmoody\u201d in a d\u00e9cor sense. As are the staff. There isn\u2019t yet the maturity of hospitality service that we found in a place like the Langham of New Zealand (where we also stayed on this trip). I\u2019m sure however with time that will come. Where the hotel is in a class of its own is its restaurant Cleo\u2019s!! My wife and I dined there twice during our stay and it was outstanding. I can think of no more daunting a task then opening a restaurant in LA. All those jaded pallets, always wanting something new. Before moving on in bovine boredom to the next \u201cbig thing.\u201d Jenny and the rest of the staff in there do an outstanding job! If in a relationship one partner is stronger than the other, then in the marriage between The Redbury and Cleo\u2019s, its Cleo\u2019s that wear the pants in this union. The food is some of the best of its type we have ever tasted. The beef cheeks, the lamb shank, and the pork belly (make sure you try that) coupled with the hot breads from the wood oven all signify a team of men and women at the top of their game. It an orgy of flavours for the mouth and frankly put, the most fun someone can have with their clothes on. So where does that leave us when summing up the Redbury? Many have reported here how dark the rooms are. So what the Redbury need do is turn on some more light not only in the rooms but in themselves and try and illuminate what they are trying to be. Are they a hotel or a serviced apartment? Perhaps they should have a few more business meetings over dinner in Cleo\u2019s and see how it\u2019s really done. At the moment the Redbury is a concept in search of direction. As you leave Cleo\u2019s and press the lift to the 5th floor, upon alighting, on the wall is a photo of Marlene \u201cThe Blue Angel\u201d Dietrich at her most melancholy. You turn to your room and immediately know the reason for the sad face, you open the door and there they are, more de-cafe pods.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St Louis", "Title": "\u201cFabulous service, fun rooms but dark spaces\u201d", "Author": "JillStLouis", "ReviewID": "UR88871519", "Content": "The concierge staff could not have been better.

With a full kitchen, a long island, large open space and balcony, it is the perfect room to entertain a small group in (5-12 people) or stay in for an extended period. I really can't say enough about how gorgeous the hotel is. I've just never seen a hotel go so bold from an architectural and decoration standpoint. The bed is a good one with fantastic pillows. Wasn't crazy about the bathroom products and the air conditioning was a little powerful while on the bed. These are very minor points though as everything was just about as perfect as you could wish for. My only real suggestion is to stay during the weekends on the south side of the hotel if you want complete peace and quiet and stay in once of the rooms on the north side (next to the club) if you plan on entertaining. The service was first-class. From the valet, to the front-desk, to the bellmen...perfect, perfect, perfect.
