Our room was on the top floor - BE WARNED! There are no lifts! - and it's a bit of a struggle to drag heavy luggage up 3 flights of stairs. The room was clean enough, but we discovered what appeared to be blood on one of the curtains, a cigarette burn in the cover of the futon (this is the second \"bed\") and after sneezing relentlessly for two days I opened the cover of the a/c unit to find the filters completely blocked with dust. I realise that it's basic, but it would have been nice to have had at least TWO of everything in the cutlery and crockery. One teaspoon was a bit silly. We had a constant battle with cabbies trying to find the place.

I was quite dubious about staying here because of some of the reviews I'd read on this site, but it turned out okay. We didn't have any trouble with the reception staff, in fact I found them to be very pleasant. We also didn't have a problem with noisy neighbours or traffic, but that might have been because we were on the ground floor on the city side. The room seemed secure enough, and the air conditioning worked, which is good because the room is smallish, and got very stuffy very quickly. There was a handy kitchenette with a microwave in our room, which made self-catering breakfasts and late dinners doable. Everything in the kitchenette was clean and reasonably well looked after. The room was generally clean, and the beds were very comfortable. I shared a room with my Mum; my sister had another room with her young daughter and our cousins. They were reasonably comfortable, too, and had a small balcony over Chalmers St. The only complaint I would have would be in regards to the bathroom. The shower cubicle wasn't cared for: there were mould stains (possibly still live mould) in the cubicle, and the lime build-up on the shower door was so bad that the door was actually immovable, with the rubber seals being quite rotten, it was a sliding door that wouldn't run on its track. It took 10 minutes of coaxing (forcing!) to get the door to open. That was pretty ridiculous, but as it was after 10pm there wasn't anyone around we could call. The bottom of the shower was stained, and though it was probably cleaner than it looked, was still a bit unpleasant. The hotel is an easy 10 minutes walk from Central Railway, and there are also buses that run along Chalmers St (a bus stop is practically out the front.) There are several places to eat just around the corner in the Cleveland street area, and also at least 2 supermarkets within 10 minutes walk (I don't know what people were complaining about when they said there's nothing close by, I guess they object to having to walk to get their dinners!) Overall, you get what you pay for here. Not a terrible experience at all, and I *might* consider staying here in future if I was with several people and we were all on a tight budget.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alicante, Spain", "Title": "\u201ccentral railway hotel, sydney\u201d", "Author": "xjenniex", "ReviewID": "UR120895290", "Content": "in August 2011after a long flight from London to Sydney I arrived at the Central Railway Hotel.

Bed was very clean and comfortable and bathroom, although some might think it needed updating was very clean and fine for my needs. The shower was really good and the water very hot. It is situated in an older part of Sydney but not too far from the Opera House and other tourist attractions.

I had been booked into this for a week at the start of November however only stayed 4 nights and moved to another property. The location is not too bad. It is a short 10 minute walk if that to Central Railway station. There's a woolies about 5 minutes away and a couple of conor stores locally as well, however there is not much else in the area. The area seemed plesent and safe. Check in was not as easy as some. I was told to call the number on the door as i would be arriving late, however when i called i was berated by the manager for calling (8.30pm) and told to ring the bell until the staff on location came to the door, which they did. Some confusion over the pre paid nature of my room when they wanted to charge me for it again however easy enough to sort out. The room itself was quite big, which was nice however my room was number 5 and faced onto the main room and was very noisey all the time. The bed is in a bad location right next to the Window and this made it impossible to sleep well. The bed was very uncomfy and when i finally got the Air con unit working which was directly over the bed, it belched out black soot all over the sheets and continued to do so. There appeared to be no housekeeping. I had a new set of towels placed on the floor of the room by the door on the 3rd day, but no bed service or any other sign of housekeeping (bins etc) however on the 2nd day i started to get eaten alive by something on the bed. I asked for the sheets and Blanket to be changed and by the 4th day i could not take it any more and checked out and found another hotel. The staff seemed very disintrested. It is a shame really but i would not touch it with a bardge pole again. A little bit of money spent doing it up and some new beds and linens would go a long way here. I would really say this is more of an upmarket Backpacker type place then a 3 star hotel, which is fine if your happy with that but for the cost of the room i did expect a little more or at least clean sheets.

The owner couple is rough, casual friendly to me. I saw the arguments sometimes with Indian family. It was not very nice at the entrance. The reason I booked was I like calm and quiet. And I read reviews on this site. But people walking around in the hotel and staff talk early morning to night. (no lift, hall way with tiles) Other people smoke outside of my room.

When we stayed here on the way back we had a first floor room which wasnt so bad with the luggage! Again it was very clean and comfortable.

We stayed over a weekend, and found it to be pretty quiet. The courtyard outside is a nice area to sit and eat your dinner or to have a ciggie and a beer. The coffee bar nearby makes great coffee and has a good range of food too. There are also a few restaurants within a few minute walk, plus a pub which serves great value pub meals.
