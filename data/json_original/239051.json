When you are sitting in the restaurant you feel as if you are able to touch the water. We only had the continental breakfast which was more than adequate so cannot comment on the hotel food in general. The Lido has few restaurants so can be limiting if you are looking for variety; may be best to eat in Venice before making the journey home across the water, although most of the meals we had on the Lido were good value for money. Don't miss the sunsets! The rooms are suites and are really clean and inviting although the bed for us was somewhat on the hard side! We do have to say that the staff were really polite, helpful and knowledgeable. The waterbus is virtually next door and the journey to San Marco is around 10 to 15 minutes but we felt this was part of the holiday. Some of the waterbuses have outside seats both front and back, take advantage of these in order to see the stunning views; you will need to be first in line! The No.1 takes you up the grande canal. You will need to get a water pass as this is much cheaper than paying for single trips; cheaper to buy online 7 days in advance of your trip. TIps: if you are going to the Doges Palace you need cash as they do not take credit cards. Also, don't bother with a gondala 70-80 euros for 15 minutes; a complete and utter rip off - treat yourself to a nice meal. If you don't want to pay 4 euros for a cup of coffee, look for the lovely cafes that do take out (the menu will list both sit in and take out prices). Some only have tall tables (no chairs) where you can have a good cup of coffee for 2 euro - ok no view, but 2 minutes later you can sit on the canal side and watch the gondalos coming and going at no extra cost!", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDream hotel overlooking venice\u201d", "Author": "Rumb", "ReviewID": "UR124565314", "Content": "I have just rebooked this hotel for the third year in a row, it is one of the highlights of my year.

We arrived on a rainy late October evening in total darkness on the Alilaguna ferry from the airport. The hotel was only steps away from the ferry dock and the lobby was bright and welcoming. Just turn right as you exit the ferry terminal and walk for a few minutes along the sidewalk, and you can't miss it. The front desk staff were all extremely friendly during our 3-night stay and went out of their way to answer our questions and show us maps, etc. One man even made a phone call to San Servolo for me to check opening times and tour information. When we came downstairs the first morning and walked into the breakfast room I was stunned. There was no one else there and the room was absolutely beautiful. The whole one wall is windows with a breathtaking view of the lagoon and Venice in the distance. The breakfast itself is very good with a wide selection of beverages and food. There was fresh fruit, cereal, all kinds of breads and pastries, yogurt, ham and cheese, and fresh fruit juices, still and sparkling water, and tea and coffee. Venice is about a 15-minute boat ride away. It pays to get the ACTV vaporetto pass from the airport. You can get them in various time increments (I think we did 36 hours). The pass is good for all of the ACTV public vaporetti (Venice's public water bus system), which includes the boat from Lido to Venice. We never had to worry about buying individual vaporetto tickets; it was literally hop-on, hop-off the whole three days. I think we booked the cheapest room. We were on the street side and the room was very small, but that wasn't a problem for me. There was a TV but we didn't use it. There was a fridge which actually had some space for us to put our own drinks in. The bathroom was fine and everything functioned well, and I thought the toiletries provided were really nice. The one problem that I had was that the street was VERY noisy. Usually I don't have any problems with street noise but this was beyond anything I've ever encountered. It sounded like there were trucks going past all night long. There are many restaurants and cafes (mostly pizzerias) within walking distance from the hotel. They mostly seem to be located on the main street that goes straight out from the ferry terminal, the Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta. I would most definitely stay at the Villa Laguna again.

While the hotel was pricey to start with, this was to be expected as the whole of Venice was a bit pricey. However, what was a bit frustrating was the added extras - my girlfriend got charged for a full three course set meal in the restaurant, for example, despite having only two courses from the a la carte menu. And paying 5 Euros for wi-fi in the rooms which was supposed to last an hour but actually only lasted 45 minutes (twice). When you pay for a hotel like this, I think it would go a long way for little extras such as the above to be free. And the charge to watch the redentore fireworks on the Saturday night over dinner was 140 Euros!

The vaparetto station is very close (maybe 50 yards?), so getting to and from the other islands is very easy, plus the public beach on the Adratic Sea is only a ten or fifteen minute walk from the hotel.

Therefore, knowing very well the resort, I feel entitled to state that, probably because of its proximity to the city, restaurants are a lot but almost all are either tourist-traps or restaurants of de luxe hotels, good but extremely expensive. That's why I cannot say anything about the hotel Villa Laguna where obviously I have not stayed, but I can say that I have tried its restaurant which has been a pleasant surprise. The location is absolutely unique, with a magnificent view over the lagoon and the city of Venice, not only in summer when, on the terrace,you can have dinner after a drink sitting in very comfortable armchairs, but also during the winter. The menu is not particularly large, but includes some typical Venetian dishes and some international dishes, plentiful and well prepared. The service is excellent: very professional,quick and thoughtful. But the main surprise is at the end: a bill absolutely fair and unexpected, above all considering that Venice is supposed to be the most expensiove Italian city. In conclusion, during my last wekend at the Venice Lido, I have had dinner at this restaurant for all the three evenings, always to my great satisfaction. Just to complete my account, I have to add a minor, unfavourable remark, for which the management is to blame only in part: I acknowledge that the Venice Lido is a resort and that the Villa Laguna is not a de luxe hotel, but even foreigners should know that Venice is not in Africa and that the restaurant guests ( mainly the male ones ) should avoid coming for dinner wearing shorts and barefoot sandals which, at least as far as I am concerned, spoil the beauty of the place.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cYou'll be delighted with this hotel\u201d", "Author": "bonvoyage30", "ReviewID": "UR113867686", "Content": "The view from this hotel is magnificent with the skyline of historical Venice a short vaparetto ride away.

However, very happy with our choice. The Lido is the 'real' Venice, filled with Italians and not with hordes of tourists. Plus, it is only a short 10 minute vaporetto ride from Piazza San Marco and the vaporettos run very frequently, until quite late at night. The hotel itself is very traditionally decorated in Venitian style - not our tastes exactly, but it all added to the experience. We were in Room 2 I believe on the ground floor, with doors opening into our own private bit of grass right on the lagoon with a little table and chairs. The room itself has four very small rooms - a very small living space with couch and TV, a small bedroom, bathroom and kitchen area (which we didn't touch). I think they could probably make a better use of the space by knocking through the wall and having one big bedroom, but still nice. The bed wasn't the most comfortable (the usual two twin beds pushed together Euro-style affair) but passable. Hotel breakfast was ample with standard continental offerings - cereals, fruit, meats, cheeses, hard boiled eggs and breads. There seemed to be an outdoor area for drinks in the evening that wasn't open whilst we were there because the weather was pretty terrible (rain everyday). The Lido had a great selection of places to eat in the evenings, some very busy! Recommend the Roxy, which had a set menu offering that was very good and reasonably priced. After a couple days battling the tourists on the main island, we spent a day just exploring the Lido by bike, which is recommended. As it was May, the beaches were still closed but got to see the Hotel des Bains (under construction), Excelsior plus miles of lovely coastline before heading back to Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta for some ice cream. Overall, I am really happy with our decision to stay at Villa Laguna and on the Lido. After a day amongst the crowds in Venice, it was a welcome calm and gave us some real insight into the local people and culture.

This is a charming property and we had a spacious suite for 4 people. We had an additional room for 2 other people in our group. Their room was on the bottom floor, while we were just one floor up. Would have preferred rooms next to each other, but as this is a small property is wasn't really an issue. Both rooms were very clean and kept clean throughout our stay. The living room portion of out suite had a small balcony outside with chairs and a pullout sofa where my 2 teenage boys slept. Also a small table and chairs and a large sofa type chair were in this room. There is a kitchenette also, if you ask for the key to open it up there is an additional charge. We did not use it. We loved the spacious accomodations and appreciated having separate sleeping rooms for the 4 of us in our suite. The room for 2 had it's own little private sitting area that faced the lagoon...very nice. There is an adequate breakfast spread...cereals, fruits, pastries, meats, cheese, etc. And the hotel serves dinner in their restaurant. We did eat there one night just for the convenience of it. It was a very good meal, but it a little pricey. They have a bar outside in the evenings, though we did not utilize it. The location is great...right on the lagoon and a very quick walk from the vaporetto. The vaporetto ran regularly, but it could take some time to get across to St. Marks Square...depending upon how many stops there were. We enjoyed the Lido very much as it was nice and quite, but we did spend some time getting back and forth from Venice. This would be the only drawback of staying here. That being said, I would stay here again, as it was a very nice property with friendly staff. We did purchase the 72 hour vaporetto pass, and this came in quite handy for the trips back and forth as well to go to Murano and Burano. Also to just hop on in Venice to get around when we were tired. My only negative comment about our rooms would be the TV's...we had 2 in oiur suite...we couldn't get one to work at all. And the other worked but didn't get many stations. I don't think the TV in our room for 2 worked. This wasn't really a problem, as we were not there to watch Italian TV...just turned it on while winding down in the evening. But we also had the same issue at our hotel in Rome later on this trip. Overall, we had a great stay and would recommend this property. Also...I had emailed the hotel a couple of times before our arrival with questions...both times received very prompt and friendly responses.

It was very easy to reach from the Marco Polo airport. Follow the covered pathway to Alilaguna (just after the water taxis) and for 26 euros each, the boat will drop you at Lido, less than 200 meters from the hotel. (note: pay in cash for Alilaguna as its parent company is a casino so you you get hit with a cash advance if you pay with credit card). Turn right and you will see the beautiful red building. We stayed in the suite which was very large and had a kitchen which we didn't need. (it was extra for the kitchen if you used it) It had lovely rustic beams and a good size bathroom. We loved the character of the room. The only downside was that it was right over the vaparetto stop so it was a bit noisy with the boat engines but not enough that we wouldn't stay there again. The young lady on the desk was extremely cheerful and full of lots of good advice. The breakfast was lovely and the view of Venice and all the boat traffic was very entertaining to watch while eating. It was a very large breakfast and usually we didn't need lunch. Other reviews have mentioned how expensive the restaurant is, they offer a lovely welcome dinner for your first night for only 28 euros which is a real deal and the smoked fish was wonderful. The vaparetto stop is right there so it is easy to get to Venice, the train station, Murano as the vaparettos come by every few minutes. We got the 72 hour pass so didn't have to worry about getting tickets. The weather wasn't the best while we were there so we didn't go to Lido's beach but would like to come back to see it.

A 12 minute boat ride away from the main shops and museums and on the direct service from the airport. The hotel is no more than 2 minutes walk from the boat so no worries about lugging suitcases up and down the bridges and cobbles in central Venice. We did notice some noise from the boats during the night but I challenge anyone to beat the view from the breakfast terrace. Bed wasn't the best but by all accounts that's quite typical in Italy. Staff were very good although they didn't seem to keen on people leaving breakfast too late. They say up till 10.30 but started to clear a bit earlier. Typical continental breakfast but plenty of choice and quality was fine. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant for reasons other reviewers have mentioned. It's about 3 times more expensive than the wide range of local restaurants on your doorstep. One supermarket within 5 minutes of the hotel stocked soft drinks and everything you would need for snacks etc at really good prices but was always packed with long queues at most times of the day so sometimes, it's worth paying a bit more not to waste time doing what we can do back in the UK! Best advice for anyone going to stay on Lido is buy the 48 or 72 hour boat pass and make full use of it.

So the Laguna enjoys the perfect location across the lagoon on the Lido which lies just to the south of Venice. It also enjoys one of the most fabulous views in the world across the Lagoon to St. Marks Square. > > We have stayed at the hotel several times over a number of years and with heavy hearts watched it decline in decor and standards. Now under new ownership and fully and superbly refurbished, we have fallen back in love with the lovely Laguna. Sitting in the breakfast/dining room looking across the Lagoon frantic with boats of all descriptions, St, Marks gleaming in the sunshine across the water, is our own small heaven. > > Because we often stay in large, hopelessly bland, boring hotels for work, the Laguna is a perfect size with around 20 rooms. For the best views across the Lagoon, ask for suites 317 or 318 on the third floor ( there is a lift). And another tip is always ask for rooms facing the Lagoon. > > For us, a long leisurely breakfast is one of life's simple pleasures and the breakfasts at the Laguna are splendid and sufficient, plus that stunning view! Staff throughout on our last visit were thoroughly helpful, courteous and kind. > > The Lido is really Venice's hidden gem and one of the reasons we love the area so much. Its ten minutes from Venice by waterbus but with its own entirely separate character. The architecture is still ravishing, the pace is calmer, the restaurants informal and inexpensive, the long beach on the southern side stylish and chic. Renting beach tents and recliners is expensive, but we join the locals by the sea-shore or the jetties in front of the private beaches. There is also a long stretch of public beach just beyond the Hotel Des Bains. And blissfully there are few English accents and no radios, as well as a real family atmosphere. > > Our advice to people visiting Venice is simple. By all means enjoy St. Marks Square, the Bridge of Sighs and the Rialto Bridge but then walk away from the milling throng of tourists. You can always be away from the crowds in a matter of moments and wander the by-ways and canal-sides for hours.
