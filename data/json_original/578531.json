The hotel is modern where one can relax and enjoy a cocktail by the poolside or enjoy the surf of the beach which is 50 meters away from the pool. Although the staff is professional they are quite distant with regards to American staff. One must continue asking questions in order to find out more about the area or things to do around Gava Mar. There isn't much to do unless, you are into running, exercising and enjoying a peaceful weekend or for a special event then it is ideal. The rooms are average size but convenient and have a wonderful view of the vast park and poolside as well as the sea. My idea of staying at a hotel is convenience so Gava Mar is a place that I recommend. Nevertheless, it does have its inconveniences such as boisterous children who are accompanied by families during the high season. Unfortunately, they are not well versed in being in a public atmosphere where they scream around the poolside or dive in the pool with such vigor that many times I left to the beach for rest and relaxation. I highly recommend that they have a person survey this area since it is important to have a peaceful stay. Also, they should clean the poolside area more often as it tends to become less attractive when guests leave their towels, newspapers, ashtrays around. The reception area is quite large with a wide screen television and seating to watch the news or football matches. Also, they have WIFI so its better to work there than in your room as its spacious and people rarely go there. The restaurant is nothing to rave about since we had dinner there once... it was disappointing. its better to go across the street to the famous tapas restaurant a few hundred meters away to the right of the hotel. The breakfast room is small but one can find a buffet style breakfast with everything so that is a plus. Again, if you want scrambled eggs, you must ask for it. It's a bit noisy since it has a combination of family/convention/couples as guests so either get up very early or very late to avoid the rush and noise. Overall: Rooms: Clean and practical Minibar: free orange juice, bottled water and coke/beer...great! Bath/toilet: clean and spacious Spa/gym: one must go to a facility that the hotel recommends that isn't too far off but its quite busy. The hotel should build one on its vast property for its guests. Pool: good size but should build a children or family pool on the opposite side of the park. Price: between \u20ac230-350 for a night which is pricey outside of Barcelona Restaurant: I recommend eating out Breakfast: \u20ac15 (all you can eat) buffet, a bit pricey for Spain. Location: near the airport but in a peaceful residential area Staff: Professional but need to be more friendly towards guests Recommendation: Have the staff survey the noise (noisy children), which is impossible. Anecdote: Gava Mar is an exclusive residential area where television hosts and football stars have a secondary home (near the airport). Its a nice place and will continue to frequent Gava Mar!", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cVery nice out of town hotel\u201d", "Author": "G V", "ReviewID": "UR125275016", "Content": "The hotel is very nice with modern style rooms.

The buffet breakfast is a bit expensive and was extra, but was free for our 11 year old, having said that, the breakfast was very good. There is a very helpful tourist office up the road, and there is a bus stop only 5 minutes away, which has a bus that brings you directly into Barcelona - cheap and very efficient! The only negative I would have is the availability of restaurants in the immediate Gava Mar area, there were very few - although there is one restaurant - Torreon, which is just a hundred metres from the hotel, that was very good, although a little on the expensive side for Spain, but worth it.

We spent the night her after a cruise before flying back to the US. I was about to book the Renaissance BCN when I noticed this came up as an option on Marriott.com (AC Hotels are now a part of Marriott but you cannot earn points etc until later in 2011) and booked instead. The hotel is in a pretty quiet beach area about 10 minutes from BCN but has gorgeously landscaped grounds with a great pool and is feet from the beach. After a few nights in downtown Barcelona followed by the week long cruise it was the perfect option for a relaxing one-night stay (at a great value as well- app 80EUR). The only problem is there are no really good connections to BCN or Barcelona with the exception of taxi. There are also only a couple restaurants in the area so I wouldn't recommend more than a 1 or 2 night stay . The hotel itself is very modern yet functional. They say every room has a sea view but I think the ground floor rooms can only see the beautiful grounds/pool and not all the way to the beach. We were on the second floor and had a decent ocean view. The rooms are large and what you would expect from a Marriott associated hotel. Nice perk is the free mini-bar...There were a few bottles of mineral water, fresh juice, sodas, and 2 bottles of San Miguel (one of which was non-alcoholic). I'm not sure if it is daily but when we were there on a Sunday they had set up an outdoor cafe by the pool with an extensive buffet (25EUR) and other options for sandwiches etc. The cheeseburger was actually quite impressive. I'm sure that AC becoming a part of Marriott this hotel will gain in popularity but hope they keep their current service standards.

The views from the bedrooms across the large well tended hotel garden are very relaxing; overlooking both the hotel\u2019s private sumptuous swimming pool and about 50 metres beyond, the beach and the Mediterranean Sea. When the sun is shining, as it often was for us (in Apr \u2013 May), the sight of the waves was very enjoyable. The hotel cleaning staff were very good. The restaurant nearest to the hotel was superb; all the others we went to during our stay were very good. We enjoyed our stay. However\u2026 Most disappointingly, the hotel maintenance electrician was not competent. When we arrived, whilst investigating why the TV did not work, one of the mains power sockets fell out of the wall exposing lethal voltages. The hotel Manager called hotel maintenance. The hotel maintenance man came, screwed the socket back in to the wall and said it was now safe, but it was not. After he left, the socket fell out again. Mostly, the hotel staffs were very responsive. One of the receptionists later in our stay was very helpful, going out of her way to assist us in providing light bulbs. However, I had never got the room heating control to work \u2013 advice from a receptionist early in our stay was dismissively \u201cyou won\u2019t get cooling until next month\u201d (I had sought her advice because the printed room guide, amongst a number of deficiencies, said nothing about how to get the heating control to work). I did not get the room heating/cooling system to work in \u201cthe next month\u201d (May) either. After the first night with the room becoming too hot for me (27 Deg C) I vacated the room at 4 in the morning, for a cooler time in the Hotel lounge. Subsequently, I opened the room sea-ward door to provide cooling - this proved effective, even if the window mosquito nets did not; my wife suffered 8 mosquito bites over our last 3 nights. After we had first reported the electrical problem, the hotel manager had arranged some gifts to be placed in our en-suite, after our second complaint, and us being moved to a new room, the gifts failed to materialise. We had to wait at reception on our arrival. We then had to move to a new room as the first was unsafe. I then had to return for the third time to reception as the second room was deficient a pillow.

The chairs around the pool were very comfortable and they even had lovely cabanas (at no extra charge) that had pillows, blinds, etc. If you wanted to hit the beach instead, access was right next to the hotel- but we preferred the quite and cleanliness of the pool. It is literally a 7 minute drive to the airport and is really ideal for a quite day or 2 either before or after exploring the city. There are planes often going overhead but you don't hear it in the rooms at all. Ensure that before you get into a taxi that you have the directions to get there as some taxi's don't know anything outside of the city. we ended up paying 35 Euros as our driver had to keep getting out to ask for directions. This is a definite gem and we will most certainly return there again if cruising out of Barcelona.", "Date": "August 24, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "AC Hotel Gava Mar by Marriott", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d578531-Reviews-AC_Hotel_Gava_Mar_by_Marriott-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$148 - $185*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">C/ Tellinaires 35</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">08850</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "578531", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/55/9b/559b25181c4a239c303afd95bdf46faa8large.jpg"}}
