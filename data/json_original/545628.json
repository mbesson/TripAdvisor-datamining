Arriving at the hotel, you can leave your car in the entrance where a personnel member will move it to the free hotel parking. The personnel is very pleasant, helpful and quick while their English are quite okay. Room size at least in my case was standard and very clean. View was nothing special as I did not get sea view but the buildings are not next to each other - space is quite open. The mattress was not exceptional but good enough to sleep well. Bathroom was spacious, clean and elegant. I chose a smoking room and they gave me 5th floor. Breakfast was served from 7 to 10. The selection was quite big (fruits, cheese, hams, eggs) but I think it could have been a bit more \"europeanised\". Hotel location is excellent as Baghdad street is 50 meters away. You have a wide range of shops - in most cases luxurious brands - a lot of restaurants and a few bars. Overall I do recommend this hotel if you are going for a few days.
