I would highly recommend purchasing a few snacks at the grocery store as everything at the hotel is of course crazy high. The coffee bar/gift shop was outrageous! We ate at the lobby grille for dinner and it was okay for the price. The Rooste is pretty cool but I wouldn't say the food is to die for or anything. The water park was great as always and this time they didn't search my bag when we came in. Last year they did and confiscated my sunflower seeds! The worst thing was when we tried to watch a movie in the room. It was $16.99! I knew it would be high but that was over the top.

After 5 minutes, we left. I was in the Sedona building in a very large room- no complaints, yes TVs are dated but no big deal to me.

They got my order wrong the second time but I didnt' have time for them to fix it. - The hotel bar is pretty bad. - The gym is quite nice - good facilities, clean, good hours.

The resort itself is beautiful, from the fountains to the grounds, to the golf course, the lobby, all very pretty. The rooms are clean and very spacious, bathrooms clean, my only complaint would be the TV's which are very small and very old. But again as many have said, most people are going here to sit in their rooms and watch TV. There are nice flat screens in the lobby bar to watch the big games. Golf was enjoyable although it is a difficult course with target golf being the order of the day on the back nine. Definitely worth playing a round. The waterpark was a blast, slides are fun, beware the high speed tubes will beat you up a bit from the impact at the bottom. Lazy river is great relaxing fun. Wave pool, etc etc etc. All a great time and plenty of chairs no matter what time of day you get there. I think most of those bad reviews were spring break time in which case what do you expect.

When we arrived at 2 PM we were told our rooms were not ready but they would put a rush on them since we had an early check-in and for us to call in an hour. We called every hour and they told us they are working on our rooms, however, it was not until after 6 PM when they were finally ready. The front desks response when we went to get our keys: \u201cWell we\u2019re busy today\u201d. No apology, just attitude which surprised us for the type of resort this is. We were off to a bad start but we were looking forward to a great vacation. The room was large and fairly close to the water park, in fact none of the rooms are very far from the park, which is nice. The following day we got to the water park shortly after it opened ; it seemed crowded but we did not have any trouble finding five lounge chairs together. The food at the park is traditional water park food with typical pricing (expensive). The food and drink service was responsive and quick. We stayed until 6 pm when the slides and river features closed figuring we would get cleaned up and go out to dinner. When we got back to the room, it had not been cleaned. We waited another half-hour to get it cleaned; to management\u2019s credit, they were responsive when we called this time. The following day the power went out in the building. Later the same day the water was turned off to the whole building without notice. When we called the front desk to ask when the water would be turned on we were initially told they were unaware of a problem. Subsequent calls we were told, \u201cThe water will be on within the thirty minutes\u201d. The water finally was turned back on around 7 PM. The following morning at 8:30a.m. housekeeping was knocking on our door to clean the room. Really, they could not manage to get there on any other date before 5:00p.m., unless we called. We spoke directly with the Manager on duty, in person, regarding the hotel's promise to honor a 4p.m. check out time, due to our inability to get in our room until after 6p.m the first day and he promised to honor it. Imagine our surprise when our key failed to work at 2:00p.m.!!! Problems with the room aside, the water park is enjoyable and well kept. Food and drink service is fast and efficient. The wave pool did not appear to be on the entire time we were there and the area was constantly filled with floats from the river feature. There was not a line for the \u2018big\u2019 slide and a relatively short line for the shorter slide. Note, when you slam into the water from the big slide it hurts\u2026 I guess that is why there is not a line. Overall, with a Management shakeup and the hiring of additional housekeeping staff this could be a 4 star hotel. The water park is most suited for younger kids, 12 and 13 year olds lost interest in the park after a few hours. This is a nice \u2018quick trip\u2019 if you live close, but the Arizona Grand is certainly not a destination and we will not be back.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surprise", "Title": "\u201cAmazing family get-away.....\u201d", "Author": "cambridge101", "ReviewID": "UR128194977", "Content": "My family came last summer and will be coming once again May 5th!

You can tell rennovations have been made in certain parts of the buildings. Be aware, since it is such a large facility, a large ammount of walking is required! *Rooms- The rooms were comfortable, and had old charm.

Televions needed exchanging, orand a slightly bigger bathroom would have been nice. Overall, good rooms. Bed's comfortable, pillows AMAZING. *Oasis Water Park- Fun for all ages!

The kids ran off, and we spent the entire day there. The water is excellent, and the lazy river's exceptional. Tip: If unable to find a lounging chair due to hortage, ask a staff member! *Food- Considering we were on a budget, we did not eat at all around the resort. Instead, for dinner we drove up the hill to a fun, western restaurant called Rustler's Roost. The slide into the dining area welcomes you, and the saw dust on the floor added to the effect. Don't be afraid to try Rattlesnake... tastes like chicken!:) *Extras- If you are on a lower level or have a bad view, some portions of the buildings have stairways to the roof. At the fall of dusk we went up one of the stairways and found not only a fabulous phoenix view, but lounging chairs!

The friendliness and service was quite good, and most people were very approachable. Front desk service was very good as well. The good: there was something for everyone there. There are multiple pools and hot tubs on the resort, and the adult pool offers an area away from the hustle and bustle of the water park. The spa is great for relaxation as well. The entire resort was very safe feeling and very comfortable wherever I went. The not so good: The key cards for your room REALLY need to be updated. I had nothing but trouble with mine, and ended up making 4 or 5 trips back to the front desk just to get into my room. The housekeeping staff are on the job quite early, and in some cases were knocking on doors before 9 in the morning (I found this disturbing). I also had housekeeping just walk into my room without knocking at all. The resort offers a few different choices of restaurants, but I spent the most time in the \"lobby grill\". The food itself was great, but I found the staff had some \"weak\" servers. Sometimes I would be taken care of better than ever before, and other times I would have lengthy waits for any attention at all. I found this frustrating at times, and can even single out who was good and who was slacking. In addition, the room doors and outside walls do not offer much silence. I was awoken a few times by screaming children or even the sound of a suitcase being pulled across the stone walkways. Overall: It was a good experience. The atmosphere here is perfect for families or couples, but I wouldn't recommend it to singles, as there were virtually no other people here that were like me. 90% of the time, service is fantastic but there were one or two servers in the kitchen that need to be helped. Room quality was good, but the key cards desperately need to be updated to something a little more reliable. If you are going somewhere with the kids or your significant other, I highly recommend it.

The moment we arrived, we were greeted at our car by the concierge who welcomed us and pointed us to the check-in desk. After our check-in, the concierge drove a golf cart leading us to a parking spot close to our room. He took in our bags and helped us get oriented to everything offered at the resort, so customer service was extraordinary upon check-in. Perhaps we were there during a slow week, but we had no trouble finding chairs after the waterpark had opened. Eating at the Oasis Restaurant was way expensive though - I paid $44 for a cheeseburger, hot dog, chicken wrap, fries, and three small drinks. Ouch. My kids enjoyed the dive-in movie, although it was the same movie each night we went. The food overall at the resort was pricy. We ate off the property for the majority of our meals. There's a Waffle House just on the other side of I-10 and an In 'n' Out Burger south of the resort on the Ray Road exit in Chandler just a short drive away. We stocked up on breakfast items and snacks from a grocery store to help save money. Our room was in the Sedona building, room 255. It had a king size bed and a pull out sofa bed which my son used. He had no complaints about it. The bathroom was very big. Housekeeping did a great job of tidying up and changing our towels each day. Our stay was overall very quiet with the exception of several people congregating in front of our door late one night. As a single mom, I felt safe at the resort and my kids felt that there was plenty to do and hold their attention (ages 13 and 9.) We enjoyed walking around the beautiful grounds and exploring the area. As many have mentioned in their reviews, the tv's are dated but my kids never once complained. We weren't on vacation to watch tv, but I understand that a flat screen is a nice touch. The $40/day resort fee was a tough pill to swallow when you don't use the services each day. I was disheartened to read another reviewer say that locals got in by claiming they lost their wrist bands. There definitely needs to be better attention to detail with that because the rest of us staying there paid our dues to take advantage of the facilities. Lastly, I would like to see more cleaning throughout the day at the waterpark. By late afternoon there was garbage scattered around and the wind would blow dead tree leaves and blossoms into the pools and lazy river making it yucky. And the stairwell where you had to wait to go down the waterslide pooled up with murky yellow/brown water that you had to stand in because there wasn't a drain. Gross.

We travelled with our 3 kids (ages 11,11 and 13). The reason we picked this hotel was because of the Oasis Waterpark. The resort is nicely located, easy access to restraunts and shopping. When we arrived the employee at the check-in desk wasn't as friendly as we expected and was not clear to where our room was located. We ended up finding it on our own. We booked the Resort Queen Suite which was big enough for our family. The only down side about the room is that the bathroom sink is located on the outside of the bathroom that is adjoined to the bedroom. The bathroom itself was a bit small but our family of 5 managed pretty well. Housekeeping did a pretty good job cleaning the room everyday. Now one thing I have to point out is that some room are actually adjoined by a door. When we arrived the door that adjoined our room with the one next door was actually unlocked. Thankfully the next door room was empty and we locked the door. For some families this may be a safety concern so if you stay at this hotel double check that the door that adjoins your room with the room next door is locked. Overall our stay was pleasent the concierge staff were espescially friendly and the waterpark is a nice addition. If you're family is looking for a cheap affordable place to stay in Phoenix this in not the hotel for you. For our stay of 4 nights we ended up spending about $1000 just to book this hotel not including meals. There are lots of other hotels that offer a great rate plus breakfast. But if you're looking for a nice resort aimed at a family vacation and are willing to spend a little more then the Arizona Grand is the right choice.

AAA missed the mark on this one...\u201d", "Author": "wendypel", "ReviewID": "UR127822317", "Content": "In a continual quest for the resort that can meet our 11 twin boys' expectation of fun and our need for comfort with a splash of luxury, we selected the Arizona Grand Resort because of it's water park and 4 diamond rating. It turned out to be a disappointment for all. Here are my few pros and many cons: The Room: Pro: We stayed in a Deluxe Queen Suite and had paid to be in a building near the waterpark. The room was large enough for the 4 of us. The beds were comfortable and the amenities were nice. Con: The carpet was wet...we are hoping it was just cleaned? I guess we can take comfort in the fact that they do clean the carpets, but it gave the room a really musty smell and a general sense of unease. The bathroom door was warped and required a contortionist move to close it. The bathroom was extremely small and dark. The TVs were from last century and very small. The sofa bed could hardly be called a bed - the mattress was so thin - and squeaked all night. The Water Park & Pools: Pro: They have a water park and they have lots of pools. Cons: Our boys were bored with the waterpark in under an hour - and my kids love water parks. Maybe if you have younger kids - and/or less adventurous kids - it might work for you? You have to wear a bracelet to get into the park...it's a little annoying as an adult. All the reviews are right that there are not enough chairs. And we found that was more the case at the pools away from the park. For a 4 diamond resort, the pool towels are small, thin and simply awful. Food & Beverage: Pros: N/A Cons: Other than an order of fries, we never ate at the hotel...not for lack of trying. The wait staff at the park walked by us no less than a dozen times and never once asked if we wanted anything. The ice cream machine at the park was broken. The restaurants at the hotel were so far away from our room (and 4 Diamond expensive) that we would have needed to take our car anyway, so we went out for dinner. We did attempt to catch lunch before our flight at the Lobby Grill - at 11:00 when they said they were open for lunch - but were told we had to wait until all the breakfast guests had finished before she could even seat us. We left. Other annoyances: 1) The hotel staff uses loud gas-powered golf carts to get around. They beep when in reverse. The staff drives them on the paths in front of the guest rooms - until late at night. 2) A plus for some, but an annoyance for us, they have a kiddie DJ in the waterpark that goes from 6 - 8 and the volume is loud. If you have pre-tween or tween girls, this is probably a big hit, but it was a primary reason we fled the hotel for several hours. 3) The whole place just seemed tired. My husband commented that the place needs a good pressure wash. 4) There always seemed to be housekeeping staff in the halls (who had a fabulous knack for leaving their carts blocking passage), but there also seemed to always be dirty dishes and linens in the halls. 5) It is right off the freeway - which is convenient, I guess, but it really doesn't give you the sense that you are \"getting away from it all.\" So, our quest for the ideal vacation resort continues. I guess I am most baffled by how this place has a 4 diamond rating.

We were surprised that the package only came with four water park bracelets and that there would be an additional charge for the fifth bracelet. Thankfully, one of the front desk staff took care of us and simply gave us the fifth bracelet for the water park. I think that if the resort allows you took book rooms with five, you should expect the same number of bracelets for the water park. Our room could have used a tv upgrade.

The biggest thing that everyone going here should be aware of is that if you are not in line at least one hour before the waterpark opens, you are not getting a chair at all until around 3:30. The park opens at 10:00 and by 10:15 there is not a single chair available. People begin lining up at 8:30 am. After 10:15 you will have to find a patch of grass and even concrete in the corner to set up camp for the day. Also, they search your bag everytime you enter the park. You are not allowed to bring ANY outside food or drink in. I was forced to throw away my water that was 2/3 gone. After being searched several times at the airport on the way there (normal procedure) it was offensive to have to then get searched daily at my \"relaxing\" resort. Then there were SEVERAL little things that just added up eventually. For example, had to call everyday for coffee in my room, one day my room wasn't cleaned at all and when I called at 3:00 to inquire I was treated like I was asking for a million dollars. Finally, the staff, including management, never wanted to hear about any complaints. Just an overall feeling that they really did not care one way or another.

The suite was very tastefully decorated in a modern, fresh taupe and cream palette with wicker accents. It was very clean with the exception of a couple grease marks on the carpet from a previous occupant's wheeled suitcase. The suite contained a bedroom with two queen beds, a built-in closet, a TV, and the bathroom. The bathroom was TINY (the door barely cleared the toilet) with the sink and granite make-up counter/mirror out in the bedroom area. I personally dislike this design due to lack of privacy for the person getting ready. Plus, turning on the lights above the make-up counter to see wakes up anyone still sleeping. The beds were comfy with pretty white linens encasing a feather comforter. We had four pillows per bed although they were tiny (about 1/2 the size of a normal bed pillow). The bath towels were thick and fluffy. There is a french door in the bedroom, with very nice \"black out\" drapes, leading out to a small balcony that is handy for hanging wet swimsuits to dry. The bedroom was separated with a door from a living room that contained a sleeper sofa desk/table with chairs, another TV, and a mirrored wet bar area with a second small sink and refrigerator (no microwave). The set-up was perfect for our two kids to stay up watching TV without disturbing us while we slept. There was a game controller with the TV, but renting the GameCube and the games were extra $$$. The suite was very quiet -- we didn't hear any other hotel guests during our stay. Without fail, the maid service came to spread up the beds and replace the towels no later than 4:00pm each day (remember to leave them a tip when you check out!) Our suite overlooked one of the two \"family\" pools with a jacuzzi that were open from 10-10. These pools were rarely full/loud since The Oasis water park was only a 2 minute walk through the building. Guests enter water park through the gift shop, instead of the large iron gates, which I found kind of odd. The gift shop is also where you switch out your broken wrist band from the day before for a new one (unless you can tolerate leaving it on from one day to the next). As other reviewers mentioned, there is a long line that starts queing outside the gift shop a good half hour before the park opens. The Oasis contains a lazy river and the two 8-story water slides plus a large sun-bathing lounge area (plus two canopies for shade lovers). This area is called the \"island\" and is open from 10-6. The rest of the waterpark contained the zero-depth entry wave pool, jacuzzi, a kid pool (with basketball hoop), a toddler pool, a splash pad, the DJ stage, the food service station, and a large \"tiki\" style bar plus plenty of loungers. This area is open from 10-8. The DJ begins his kid-oriented schtick each night at 6:00. I understand there are movies shown at dusk, although we didn't participate. During our visit to The Oasis, we were always able to get enough pool towels and lounge chairs, although the loungers were due to be pressure-washed. The roving servers for food/drink orders and people to bus the cups/plates get stretched a bit thin at certain times of day depending on the size of the crowd. We ate at the pool-side buffet (near the wave pool) for dinner one night. The food was plentiful and good ($17 adult; $10 per child), although the one-trip rule bothered a few guests in our party. Tips: 1) The resort lobby is the third exit around the traffic circle; the signage needs improving. The resort also has Villas (privately owned condos), a conference center, and a golf course, so it's easy to get lost when trying to find where to check in. 2) The Marketplace off the hotel lobby serves Starbucks and pastries for breakfast if you don't want to go to the hotel restaurant. 3) The lobby is gorgeous with outdoor seating around firepits -- perfect for an evening glass of wine. 4) The front door staff are happy to drive guests to various parts of the resort, including to the Rustler's Roost restaurant (a must see). Also consider visiting Aunt Chilupa's for margarita's -- it's a short walk on a lighted path from the hotel. 5) The Tempe Mills mall is about 5 minutes away -- kind of teen place with GameWorks (huge video arcade) and stores that appeal to the younger set, but it also is where the Sea Life Aquarium is located.

The main reason I looked at this hotel was the Oasis Water Park. Had heard good reviews. I booked several weeks ahead and was confirmed for a room with 2 queens beds (1 bed rm, 1 bath, with living rm area). At check-in I was told we were to be up-graded to a suite at no extra cost, but there was only 1 king bed, but also a fold out couch in the living room. This was because they were full and had run out of the type of room I had reserved. I took the up-grade and it worked, but I really booked this for the 2 queen beds, and was not too happy about the condition of the fold out couch. Felt bad for my grandson sleeping on the thin excuse for a mattress, and moving furniture and folding out the couch each night was not what I wanted. The hotel also has an extra fee for wifi and use of the water park, which is $40 a day on top of the room cost, and then taxes on top of it all. The wifi, at least in our room was very poor, with the connection fading in and out every few minutes (or seconds). The water park was filled with people and it was a race to just get a chair to sit in, much less two chairs together. The water temp was colder then I would have liked, but it is a fun park for kids. The hotel is pretty, with well keep grounds and the rooms are nice. King bed was soft, bathroom was modern and huge. All the employees were super nice and helpful and they get an A++. The hotel is in an busy part of SE Phoenix, but the property is large which helps make it feel less busy. Restaurants are expensive and 2 of the 3 are quite a distance from the main hotel and rooms.

The rooms were outdated, but not unclean. However I had issues with general room maintenance. E.g. Toilet handle was broken. A call to front desk resolved that. Shower did not drain. A call to front desk did not resolve it day one but a second call day two did finally fix it. TV's/remotes were old. Couches in suite area were saggy. While the suite had the makings of a good room it was in need of a makeover. Wireless was provided free in the room as part of the business package. Note that the walls/doors are thin. I could hear the family next door perfectly (like they were my own). And, there were many meal events held direcly outside of my bedroom and setup began at 6am or earlier and you could hear them rolling the tables, heat lamps/etc in the morning and tearing down after 11pm at night. The resort didn't offer the type of serenity I was expecting. At 12pm I met colleagues in the lobby and we sat on the patio and had lunch. The service was slow but the food good. We split a Cobb salad and a pizza. The portions were large. From there we went to the spa. I thought they did wonderful job with the gym setup. While the spa waiting room wasn't luxurious, they did serve fresh fruit and tea/water. My massage was fantastic - probably the best I ever had given by an Italian named M. I did not use the water park or the golf course. We did try other restaurants and the service was pretty much the same - slow and uneventful. As far as the conference space, it was not top notch.

The Resort: the property is lovely and well laid out. It's right next to the highway, but (at least where we were staying), you would never know it. It's in Tempe, but we found easy 20-minute access to everywhere we wanted to go (restaurants, baseball, etc.). The Rooms: we had a Deluxe Suite in the Camelback building. The room was fine. As reported by others, the TVs are old, but ours worked fine. It was clean. The pullout couch bed was incredibly uncomfortable. The regular beds were comfortable. We removed the mini-bar items and used the refrigerator to keep drinks, etc. that we bought cold. Our coffee supplies were never refilled after used the first time. There were never enough towels or bath amenities, but we just took towels from the pool area and found a housekeeping cart to get more shampoo, etc. We did want an extra blanket one night and were told they were out of blankets. Housekeeping came one day after 5, one day at 9 am and late afternoon the other days. That's unacceptably erratic in my mind, but didn't cause us any problems. The Waterpark - We used the waterpark almost everyday, although we only went for chairs there once. As reported, a line forms about an hour before the park opens for people to get chairs. We lined up the first day about 30 minutes prior to opening and were able to get chairs. After the first day though we decided we preferred it at the pool at our building (which is near the waterpark). So we would get chairs there and run over to the waterpark when we wanted to slide or ride the river or grab some food. The waterpark was crowded (of course), but nothing unexpected. I was always able to get a tube when I wanted one and the wait staff is nice. The food: we only grabbed muffins and coffee in the morning at the marketplace and lunch at the waterpark (we got dinner elsewhere based on prior reviews here). The coffee is Starbuck's. The marketplace cafe does not seem to have a good system, but the coffee and muffins were fine. The lunches in the waterpark were good, but expensive. About what you would expect for resort pricing (lunch for five, including one alcholic drink and 4 Icees) was around $75. I don't find it obscene, but it's not cheap. For those of you from states not graced with In-N-Out Burgers, there is one on Ray Rd. a couple of exits down. The staff: all around we found the staff pleasant and helpful. I went in with reasonable expectations. The rooms are basic motel quality, with nice grounds, pools and the waterpark. We wanted to relax, lay in the sun and were able to do just that.

The water park is fabulous!! On our visit, however, we didn't get to enjoy it because it rained and the temperature was in the 50's--very cold for Arizona. The hotel should give a small compensation to guests when the temperature is in the 50's, and when it rains. Maybe give you back a portion of the cost of lodging, or at a minimum the $40 resort fee that they charge you. It was really a shame. We wouldn't have stayed here if we knew it was going to rain and be cold. I peeked in over the fence, and noticed a concession stand and saw hot dogs and french fries going for $7 each. they don't allow outside food in the water park. We had a suite. It consisted of 2 rooms, one with 2 queens, and a sitting area, both with tvs. (Be aware that you got tax charged twice--once for getting a suite, which we weren't told about and only found out when we got our bill emailed to us. In an effort to be green, they don't give you a hard copy of your bill.) the room had a broken knob, hair on the bathroom floor that wasn't vacumed, and a dirty coffee cup that wasn't replaced. The breakfast offered was not gourmet. When staying at a resort, I like stuffed french toast, and other offerings, but nothing gourmet was offered. The waitress who took my order only offered me green or black tea, and never showed up with it until I was half way done with my meal, and after I had flagged down another worker who showed me a variety of teas, and immediately got me a cup. The exercise facility was huge, but the individual ellipticals and bikes did not have their own tv. There were three huge tv's that you could watch--old fashion style. There was no where to plug in your head phones. You had to bring your own portable ipod or radio or something. The resort sent me a list of activities so I could plan my visit prior to arrival. I showed up for a 6am Total Body workout only to find out that they didn't offer that class anymore. Why was it on the schedule sent to me? The person at the front desk of the exercise facility treated me as if I were imagining having received something about a class. Finally another worker told us both that a class used to exist at that time, but not in a long, long time. No one apologized to me. A nice little extra that they offer is free rides over to the outlet mall that is close by. It's nice for people who don't have cars. (We had a car.) Please understand, I'm not a complainer.

The water park was the primary reason we chose the resort. Overall, we very much enjoyed the trip, but I'm not sure that we'd stay here again the next time we are in Phoenix. The Good: It was nice to have a little extra room with a suite. My kids enjoyed the small pool and hot tub near our room. The food options were acceptable & convenient. Grounds were well maintained and pretty. Housekeeping was very helpful in bringing us a lot of extra towels one day when my son had the flu. Our room seemed clean and fairly well maintained. Plenty of pool towels available. The Not so Good: The rooms were dated. The TVs were not only old, but the reception was terrible. We watched part of a basketball one evening and couldn't see the score from the beds. The water park was nice, but small and very crowded. The lazy river often became wall to wall intertubes. My kids thought the wave pool was lame compared to Disney and Great Wolf Lodge. My youngest son was upset because he was an inch too short for the waterslides. Also, the park didn't open until 10AM, so my early-riser kids spent more time at the small pool area near our room since we were attending baseball games most afternoons. The food and drink is very expensive and there is no refrigerator or microwave in the room to bring your own. There is only one espresso machine in the coffee shop, so lines for coffee in the morning were crazy long. I think it is deceptive to not include large mandatory resort fee in the room rate.

We were sent to one end of the resort to change, we then had to move our car t another area to access the water park. Again okay. Check-in is to be no later than 4 but alas it was 5:15 and still no room. Nothing they could do was what we were told, they were full. I called the reservation line from the lobby and was told they were not full. I went back to the desk and said they were not full, i wanted a room. None was provided. Kid in melt down mode, no room and no idea of when a room would be available. The concession offered was $50 in gift card to the Oasis bar. Interesting. Once you figure mark-up, the value provided was probably $15-20. Pathetic. We finally got a room around 5:30 the staff gave us terrible directions and we didn't find the room until nearly 6. It amazes me how hospitality mises the mark on the sole purpose. What would they do if their attorney or doctor showed up 2 hours late to a hearing or surgery? Would all be okay? The second, and bigger, issue we had related to allergies. This place is NOT going to work with you. My wife and daughter have Celiacs (gluten allergy). Nothing on the pool menu was something they could eat yet our snacks were confiscated when we came in. We had to then leave the pool area to eat which would not be a big deal if there were sufficient chairs. So we leave, lose our seats and by the time we return, there is no place to sit. We end up back in our room not being able to enjoy what we have paid for because of discrimination based on America condition. Thought we would bake it better for my daughter by getting her a nice bowl of ice cream for dessert. Nope. Only have sundaes and they wil not serve only ice cream. They could however charge $9 plus a $3 delivery charge plus a 23% gratuity for a scope of vanilla. I was told Paul Gray, the GM (his form responses to complaints are readily accessible) set the policy on allergies and the resort's decision on not accommodating same. Seems to be a problem that I will be happy to research once I get back home. Finally (well at least 1.5 days into a 5 days stay), I would warn families about what appears to be an reasonably priced resort. The actual cost is fine, the way you arrive there via the nickel and dime route is not. I would have rather paid more up front for another resort and been more confident in the product offered and the accomodations extended. A great example was breakfast. We ordered breakfast to our room. 2 omelette, 2 eggs scrambled, side of bacon and fruit was $74.

I began searching Cabo & Cancun and I just couldn't get good flight times at a reasonable rate, as well as Florida. We just about pitched the idea of Spring break when I received and email from a family vacation website listing their top 10 family resorts. Arizona Grand made the list. I was intrigued by the one bedroom suites and the water park. I checked Southwest vacations and the Grand was available with great flight times, I knew these flights weren't going to last so I checked a couple of reviews and booked it.

Parking is sparse. We were in the Camelback section and our room was an \"upgrade\" bc my husband signed up for the preferred guest program to get free wifi. We were told the rooms were newly renovated and that we were close to the water park for easy access. The rooms are small. We like suites bc the kids sleep in the pull out sofa and we can sleep in a king bed. At first I thought the size of the room was going to be a problem but it ended up working out. The decor was fine, nothing special and the TVs old. My main concern were the halls - they were so dark and old feeling. I didn't like the feeling. Since we had two suites, we compared notes with my inlaws and there were a lot of inconsistency. That drove me crazy - especially since they are charging a $40 resort fee per day. You had to request robes (I think at a 4 star resort that should be standard practice). I also found housekeeping service to be terrible. Amenities & towels weren't getting replenished - and when I call they never answered. I always got bounced back to the operator. It was annoying. Again not to harp, but get your largest department together, especially when charging such a hefty resort fee. It was a long a day and the girls we were fried, so we sucked it up and ordered room service pizza. Not good but we expected that. The food in general, was bad except for the club sandwich I had a the lobby restaurant. The food at pool park was not edible. Rustlers Roost on the top of the hill is a tourist trap but does have good views. I have to say my kids enjoyed themselves but I found it chaotic. They have a real bull, live music, balloon guy, slide for the kids and \"free\" cotton candy for the kids. I guess its hard not to try it, but the food was not good. Aunt Chilada's is horrible - stay away. Both myself and my father inlaw got sick that night and we think it was from there. The pool park occupied my 7 year old. They have slides, wave pools and and a lazy river. The hot tub in the pool park has too many chemicals. We actually witnessed a little boy puke bc he was overcome by the smell. Both my daughters developed a rash and I am sure it was from the harsh chemicals. More harsh than other public / resort pools I have experienced. The service was lacking for cocktails and foodservice. (as previously mentioned, the food was horrible). They did have a kiddy pool. Even though the bathrooms always smelled of pinesol, they were old and dated and dirty feeling. A lot of lifeguards on duty and towels were always available. I thought the pool chairs were old and dated and way too close together. It felt cheap. They do offer evening movies that the kids can watch \"in\" the pool and a dj and dinner buffet (didn't try). The \"regular\" pool is just that and is a nice reprieve from the over crowded wave pool. Plus it opens at 6am and closes at 10pm. There is a hot tub in that area as well and it doesn't smell over bleached. THINGS I LIKED: The kids liked the pools. My husband golfed and thought is was fine. The fitness facility is impressive and offers a private adult pool for laps and lounging. The trails behind the resort are great. My older daughter loved them, my husband had to carry my 3 yr old. We would have loved to explore that area more. WOULD I RETURN: No. The price isn't hat reasonable and I know I could find something comparable for around the same price. Especially when you factor the resort fee into it. I didn't like the location at all (except for the foothills). The food is bad. The service, which really makes or breaks a hotel fell terribly short. I never felt like the hotel was run by good management.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cFour Diamonds???

We (my wife and two girls 7&3 along with my parents) stayed for a week from 3/20 to 3/27. We stayed in room 528 of the Camelback section. Our room was facing out over the water park, which was nice. Very easy access to the water park and our own more quiet pool and hot tub in that section. With the patio door closed the noise from the water park is minimal. Check-in was a breeze and the bell man led us to our area in the parking lot with his golf cart. We parked and he brought all of our luggage up to the room and was very helpful and would not leave our room until he had answered every question that we had. Unfortunately, this was the high point of the service at the resort. We arrived around 11:00 AM so we were lucky that 1 of our 2 rooms was ready. After dropping off our bags we headed back to the lobby restaurant for lunch. We wanted to eat outside and as a party of 6 this required the hostess sliding two tables together to accommodate us. She was very put out by this request and didn't hesitate to make this very obvious to us. Lunch was actually pretty good and the view of the golf course from the patio is very nice. Unfortunately this was the best meal we would eat at any of the resort restaurants. More on the rooms. Think Embassy Suites for the typical room type at the Arizona Grand. Separate living room and bedroom with one bathroom. The girls slept on the pullout sofa bed in the living room. As many other reviews have stated, the TV's are the old picture tube monsters, not a huge deal but not 4 diamonds. The carpet in our room was stained and looked old and tired. A fridge would have been very nice, but instead we had lots of wasted space with a mini-bar area under the sink in the living room. The bed was fine, but nothing special. The balcony was very small and became the place we put wet swimming suites to dry rather than a nice place to have coffee in the morning. Speaking of coffee our room was not restocked with coffee when we arrived nor did it have a cork screw (my parent\u2019s room had both). We had to call down to get blankets for the sofa bed and the room did not have robes hanging in the armoire closet. Again, not 4 stars. After our first night, housekeeping failed to replenish the soaps, shampoo and toilet paper. We had to call to get it and even that required two phone calls. Food Lobby restaurant was fine, but rather expensive for what you got. Lunch for 5 (youngest daughter wasn't hungry) with 1 beer for each of the four adults was $120. Lobby gift shop/proshop/coffee shop was nice; they served Starbucks coffee at a modest markup from the original. Look at the food prices before purchasing, picked up a yogurt parfait for my daughters one morning but put it back when the cashier told me it was $8.50, are you kidding me? Another peeve of mine is the lack of queue management in the coffee shop. Regardless of what you order you wait in a very linear line based on when you ordered. So if you ordered two cups of coffee like me, you wait in line behind the 7 espresso based drinks that were ordering in front of you. I fail to see any logic in that at all. Aunt Chiladas, simply stated, DO NOT GO. Worst Mexican food I have every eaten, not to mention all the ducks that are wandering from table to table begging for food. Yes you just read that correctly, ducks wandering around the outside seating. To make it worse my wife and father in law were both puking in the 12 hours that followed that meal. Rustlers Rooste, tourist trap with great views. The views of Phoenix from the patio are outstanding. The slide and balloon guy for the kids are a nice touch. The food was average at best. Had a bone in rib eye that was maybe 1/2 thick and riddled with fat, not marbling just big areas of fat. Better cuts of meat can be found at the local grocery store for certain. Water Park Kids really enjoyed it but I question the maintenance. I believe they are a bit too heavy handed with the chemicals in the pools. Both of our kids had reactions to the pool chemicals. Aside from that I had to pull them both out of the 25 person hot tub as I was being overcome by the smell of what seemed like chlorine but smelled more like ammonia. Right after we got out I saw another kid get out of the tub and puke in the bushes, several others were rubbing their eyes. I reported this to the staff in the water park gift shop/gate house and they really didn't seem to care. The pools are heated which was nice and the lazy river was pretty enjoyable. The nightly movies on the big screen in the pool was also pretty cool, the kids or adults for that matter can float around in the pool in tubes and watch the movie. Golf Front nine is completely forgettable. The back nine is much better and the final 5-6 holes are really good and very scenic. Probably overpriced at $102 (resort guest rate) but it was onsite and a 2 minute walk from our room. Hiking The hiking onsite in the South Mountain trails is very fun. Not that difficult, as our 7 year old loved it and wanted to do more but it was too much for our 3 year old, she spent most of the timing riding on my shoulders, which made it a nice workout for me. General This place has potential but the rooms need a makeover, the service needs to be much better and they need to keep the place in better shape. The hall ways are very dark at night and I actually saw some dirty room service trays sit in the outdoor corridors for 12-18 hours, which unfortunately allows the birds and other critters to get at them and really make a mess of things.

This hidden fee was very disheartening to us. After arriving at the hotel and being made aware of this fee we tried to discuss this matter with several mangers and came up with nothing but arrogance by some managers we were told that we had to pay the fee. One manager stated that he would look into it and would get back to us, when my husband spoke with him again he stated that he was waiting for a phone call back from the booking agent from the resort we never heard back from him again. We spoke to another manager and she stated that it was a resort fee and we just had to pay it. We travel frequently and have never encountered hidden resort fees. Most 4 star resorts will include the resort fee in the price of the room. When a reservation states paid in full that is what the consumer expects. It seems that you must always read the fine print. A lesson learned. After we returned home we contacted the resort by e-mail we spoke with a person named Nathen who explained where we should have looked on the web site to see the fee's . I then sent the following email to Mr. nathen;\"I did find this fee after following your directions how ever it states ( Resort fee is $25 plus tax per night, except during the season when the Waterpark is open (see below for Waterpark schedule and fee, subject to change). so help me understand why I was charged $30.00 a night plus tax when the water park was not open\".

One really important advantage of this resort's pool area (over Kierland Westin for example) is that the mature palms provide tons of shade over the lounge chairs, and there are shady grassy areas by the pool as well. In May through September this is very key, because you will bake your brains out if you are not sitting in the shade. There's no humidity to break up the sun's rays out here so you must have shade.

We had a pretty good experience and I would recommend this place. I'd like to see what it's like in the summer. This is a very large resort with a great golf course (we didn't play) and lots of options for pools/hot tubs and the water park. We had one of the standard suites with 2 queen beds and pullout sofa bed. Location: Really easy to get to from the airport (less than 10 mins) and pretty quick drive to Mill Avenue in Tempe (15 min). The Mills outlet mall was just down the road. If you're in town for a Cardinals game or the Fiesta bowl it takes about 30 minutes to get to Glendale. We took a towncar from the hotel and it was $84. Scottsdale is about 20 minutes away. Service: Bell service was fantastic. The lobby was very crowded on NYE and we went down for a cab and it didn't take long at all. The resort has SUVs and cars on hand so when the cabs weren't coming fast enough they brought those out to transport guests to their New Year destination (we went to the block party in Tempe). Bell service also did a really great job getting us transportation to Glendale when we missed our bus. Good experience with wait staff as well. Main complaint was with the cleaning of the rooms. We were still in our room when the cleaning staff came one day (around noon) and we requested they come when we left in the next hour. They did not return until the next morning when we were back in the room so we didn't have a clean room for 2 days in a row. We ran out of towels and toilet paper and it was annoying but was a small issue. Food/drink: We ate breakfast a few of the days and liked the breakfast buffet. The made-to-order omelettes were really good but I did think the price was pretty high ($17/person). We hung out in the lobby bar a few times and ordered the pulled pork nachos and those were also really good! It was late at night so I wasn't expecting much and they were great. Grounds/pools: Really pretty golf course and a nice sitting area right outside the lobby overlooking the course. Good pools and hot tubs close to the rooms. We didn't try the water park but it looks really cool if you have kids. I wish I would've walked around the grounds a little earlier.

The same with our towels we put outside our door for housekeeping. Can't say the same for the freezer in our little frig - obviously housekeeping is not in charge of defrosting it as it was literally unusable due to so much ice build-up. The stairwells don't get checked by maintenance either. Two or three step lights made it very hard to see at night, let alone an emergency. The lamp next to the bed didn't work - no biggie - cord was unplugged. These are all small things, but it does make one take notice how little daily attention the place gets. The lazy river was fine as usual. I have to agree with another reviewer, unless it was coincidence. Twice we almost hit service carts - one actually u-turned right in front of our car without looking. Guess our car runs too quiet.

It was a fun weekend, but there were some highly dissapointing points. Honestly... it might have been a total bust as a location if it weren't for the water park. But even then, for the price, I'm not sure it was worth it. This trip began with said family member booking the rooms, which he understood as being 2 bedrooms (they were not, they were two beds in a room), which led to having to get an extra room. We all dealt fine, but you could see it was a bit of a dissapointment and embarrasment to them to have to find another room at the literal last minute to make everyone comfy. Well.. comfy if you have a bed, anyway. Some of the kids in different rooms used the sleeper sofa. After one night, a few of them begged for other family's couch cushions, so they could just sleep on the floor. Upon inspection of our sleeper after the complaint of the beds leaving spring marks, I was horrified to find that they were pretty much just thin mats. No wonder they were uncomfortable! So, if you're planning on using the sleeper sofas, bring an airmattress. The rooms, overall, are okay. Which is fine, if you're paying okay prices. But for 200+ a night, plus resort fees? Dirty carpets, a minifridge that does not get cold, old furnishings and tv? I've stayed at better Best Westerns for far, far less. It was very dissapointing, and we kept our socks on alot (see photos, if TripAdvisor allows them). At least the linens and bathroom were clean. Which was a suprise, because the maid service was, well, deplorable. Several of us had to call and wait several hours to get our rooms serviced (just trash) or towels, after returning and finding nothing had been touched all day! I mean, I know it's a busy weekend, but at least one room never got any service, let alone late service. NOT cool. About the only time they actually did come in force was very early on the day we were to check out. Made us feel real welcome. :( Also of note: bring a cooler with water and food. The one thing \"resort\" like at this place are the prices. Absurdly high prices for just about everything. Plan ahead. And watch your credit card. One family member's room was charged for someone else's (unrelated) rather large room service bill, along with another billing issue they had. As I said before.. probably the best thing about this place is the water park, which is pleasant and seemed pretty clean. Oh, and the amenities were Gilchrist and Soames (sp?), which were nice. But for the price, the service, and the rooms? You'd probably be much better off staying somewhere else, and visiting a water park elsewhere in PHX.

We drove to the water park to find there are no changing rooms at the park so we drug our kids back up the hill with all Our bags to change at the fitness center. Beautiful building but not family friendly. Had to explain to my 3 year old why we were changing with other naked women Walking around and trying to keep my one year old out of lockers! So we store all our belongings in several small lockers and head back down the hill to the water Park. An hour goes by and our room still isn\u2019t ready. At 6:00pm my children are getting hungry. We had a $50 resort credit and wanted to use it towards the dinner Buffet being served poolside. However we are informed that\u2019s not possible because we still are not checked into the hotel and our room STILL isn\u2019t ready at 6:00pm An night. The girls working at the pool were very kind and spoke to someone who said to go ahead and go through the buffet and they would make sure the charges Were applied to our room folio. Buffet was great for adults however, not very kid friendly. Hard as a rock chicken tenders and tatter tots were the only option for Children. No drink options other than soda. 7pm we have the pool attendees call again and our room is finally ready. I had to leave my husband and kids at the pool and Go to the other side of the property to check-in, but first go to the fitness center to get my credit card and ID out of the fitness center. After checking in and getting keys the Valet gives instructions to get to our room. It\u2019s now dark and there are no numbers on the buildings. The directions he gave were completely wrong.

The rooms were nicely kept, painted, and CLEAN (which matters most to me) and I do think our tub was also newer and slightly oversized. The TV on the other hand, was an old 19\" TV from the 90's and THAT could indeed use an update! We weren't there to watch TV, but it would've been nice to have a bigger, clearer television to watch as we laid in bed at the end of the day. The property seems to have a lot of smaller pools throughout the property where its easy to escape the crowds and wind down at the end of the day -- or in the AM before Oasis opens. We liked that. The fitness center was great -- nice and spacious! The spa was amazing -- had a wonderful 50 minute massage by Francine!! The tea and fresh fruit was a nice, added extra as well! The water park was a ton of fun -- yes, crowded, but it was Labor Day Weekend. There were lines for the lazy river, but we did find tubes in the wave pool that we brought over with us and skipped the lines doing so. You must be holding on or in a tube (at least on 2 of 3 days we were there) which did reduce some of the bobbing heads in the river which was nice (and a tad safer)! There was also a line for the slides, but it moved fairly well, maybe a 15 minute wait for the tallest slide. Service was excellent both at the bar (where we ordered our lunch (food) and skipped the snack shack line) and poolside, despite the crowds and the HEAT! There was a lot of water coolers on in the park with COLD water which I thought was a nice added touch. The bartenders were very generous with large cups of ice that we used at the water coolers as well. My girls LOVED the kids activities throughout the day, maybe more than the water park itself! They participated in balloon tosses, whipped cream games, lots of arts n crafts, guessing contests, etc. They loved floating in a tube and watching the movie on Sunday night as well. And the AZ Grand Dancers were great too! We didn't do the buffets at the water park -- but the breakfast buffet was pretty good. Great fresh fruit and a made-to-order omelet bar which we all enjoyed!! Fruit loops and bacon kept my 7-year old beyond happy . . . afterall it is vacation! :) A great time overall, at a great rate too!

For a resort that lauds itself on being one of America's finest, there were many issues that made this trip a disappointment for our family. Here's the list: no free wi-fi, water park overcrowded and the water is a tinge more yellow by 4:00 p.m. than earlier in the day, our room was not ready for check-in until well after 5:00 p.m. (check-in is at 4:00 p.m.), the rooms are spacious but aging poorly, no flat screen TVs, there was a large puddle of water in the middle of our room upon check-in, you can't take any food into the water park (not even kid's food that they don't sell anyway), the staff was rather rude, esp. at the water park, the mini-bar was luke warm, the interior pools were out of towels by noon, parking was insane, and the mattress on the pullout sofa bed was old and actually hurt to lay on. One more comment about the staff: for a high-end resort, it was apparent to me that the staff was more interested in their own needs than their guests. For example, as I was escorting my 4 year old to the bathroom at the water park, a staff member squeezed between the door and the wall to get past rather than wait patiently for the door to close. We certainly did not feel like welcome guests. I guess that is the downside of paying minimum wage to teenagers who don't really care anyway. All in all, we'll never go back and never recommend it. To the manager: take a clue from Nordstrom's. Nordstom's is excessively expensive but people keep going back to shop there. Why? The customer service is legendary. Hire yourself some customer service trainers and create your own legend.

For our first night, we arrived late on Saturday afternoon and the water park was very crowded, but that was to be expected. For the second night, we arrived late on Friday afternoon and it was much less crowded. I think there were a lot of local families there for a weekend staycation, many who probably booked the Living Social deal. (Wish I had known about that!) The grounds were beautiful and the rooms were fine, but as others have mentioned I don't understand why they didn't upgrade the TVs when they renovated. We were in the Mountainside section the first night,, which is not as convenient to the water park but is across from the golf course. Each section has its own pool (I think there are seven total on site, in addition to the water park) and we had it to ourselves to enjoy on Sunday morning. We were upgraded (no charge) to the Sedona section for our second night, which was a more convenient location, but the room was exactly the same. Check -in is at 4:00 PM, but we saw someone checking in early and they were told they could use the water park before their room was ready. Check-out is at 12 PM (noon), and the water park opened at 9:30 AM during our stay, so we got in a nice amount of time there before we had to leave. Your one-night stay is good for water park admission on both your arrival and departure days. Make sure you read the fine print about taxes and the mandatory $30 resort fee so there are no surprises when you get the final bill. Also, internet access is not included in the resort fee and runs another $14.95/day.

As with most restaurants, the kids menu could use some work; my daughters, dissatisfied with the selections, ordered off the adult menu and were happy with what they received. Dinner prices were reasonable for a resort restaurant (much more so than breakfast, actually). The one glaring down side was that the restaurant was full of flies. We were initially seated at a table near the view doors but, after being dive-bombed by at least 25 flies, requested to move. Our server apologized; he said they have not found a way to control the flies that come in off the golf course in the morning when they open the doors at breakfast.

There were hairs on the shower curtain. There was no Do Not Disturb sign in my room. My room was not cleaned until after 4:30pm. In a resort you expect relaxation but if you spend the day waiting for your room to be cleaned it\u2019s not relaxing. There is a $30.00 resort fee which basically is for a small water park that was overcrowded. The wave pool had no waves, just wall to wall people floating on rafts. The pool bar had no fans or misters. Come on, it was 109 degrees. I\u2019ve been to resorts in Las Vegas and Hawaii and guess what; they have fans and often misters. There was a $14.95 per day fee for the internet. I felt this was inappropriate due to the $30.00 resort fee. So in addition to an overpriced room rate, the daily fees were an additional $49.95. What a rip-off! At a resort, I would expect multiple restaurants and bars including some upscale dining. They advertise 3 restaurants but two of them are not run by the hotel or within walking distance. We ate at the steak restaurant and were told it is their best restaurant. The restaurant is about 2 steps below an Outback. It was not part of the hotel, as you needed to drive to it and you could not charge to your room. Breakfast in the Grill was lacking. They had a breakfast buffet for $16.00 that would not make it at Bob\u2019s Big Boy. The bacon was burnt, the eggs dried out as well where the croissants. There was one omelet station with a 10 minute wait. The buffet was set-up in the server area of the kitchen. The floor was greasy. I don\u2019t mean to disparage Outback or Bob\u2019s Big Boy as they deliver value, something this resort fails to do. As for the mini-bar; what a joke, it had a very small selection. It had 2 Snickers bars, 2 bags of M&Ms, and 2 small cans of Pringles. For alcohol it had some beer and 2 mini bottles of vodka along with a few sodas and waters. Not much of a choice.

The suite we stayed in allowed 4 wrist bands for daily access to the water park. The hotel had great proximity to the hiking of South Mountain and Piestwa Peak was only a 15 minute drive. Furthermore all of the great Phoenix shopping (Chandler Mall, Biltmore, Fashion Square) were all within a 20 minute drive. If you are a golfer (which I am not) there is a beautiful golf course attached to the resort. This is a beautiful resort with wonderful amenities that nestles up against the scenic Arizona landscape.

For one price, the resort stay plus resort fees were included, with other discounts on dining and spa. I preface my review with this information because I'm uncertain if the Grand was prepared for the response to this offer. We checked in Saturday and departed Sunday. We arrived early and were able to enjoy the waterpark. The waterslides were lots of fun, especially the Serpentine (twisty) slide. The only challenge is, if you sit up the entire way down, there is a branch to a pine tree about half way that you have to duck, or risk hitting your head (I'm 5'9\"). The lazy river was crowded, yet we were able to get a tube without too much of a wait. I qualify this statement with the following: if lifeguards were present, then getting a tube was orderly. If no lifeguard was available, it was a bit chaotic, with the guests jockeying for position, and snatching tubes from other guests. We kept calling in, as advised, to check on the status of our room. The four o'clock check-in time came and went . . . our room wasn't ready 'til 5:15!!!!! That was inconvenient, and a hassle to say the least. The front desk person said the resort was \"overbooked\". Not my problem, and should not be shared with guests as an \"excuse\". Once we did get to the room, it was comfortable for our group of four. It was disappointing to see an empty, discarded water bottle on our balcony and hair that wasn't ours on the mini-bar sink. Waiting an extra hour and fifteen minutes, the room should have been spotless!!! Regarding room layout, the bathroom is in the bedroom section of the \"suites\" which is a tad inconvenient. I used the spa services and was disappointed with one of the spa technicians talking about custody arrangements with another employee. I'm sorry for the situation, but a spa visit should be a relaxing treat for those enjoying the services. We much prefer the scale and setting of the Pointe Squaw Peak in Phoenix to this property. (The Grand is the former Pointe South Mountain.)

A friend told me that the Oasis Pool was a great place to lounge and let our kids run around. She was right. The pool was nice. Small, but nice. The boys loved the water slides, I liked the lazy river. Plenty of floats, plenty of towels. Pricey food and drinks by the pool though, so be prepared to overspend on lunch and snacks for hungry children. Also, bring cheap flops for the pool. The deck/pavement is way too hot to walk (or run, yelling \"hot feet, hot feet\") without shoes. You can leave them wherever you jump into the water, but be prepared to have others use them or take them. My friend's son kept finding his flops in different spots all over the pool. A woman sunning near me said that hers had been stolen the previous day. Now, for the hotel part of this review.... Eh...it was okay. The room was clean and it wasn't too outdated. Its the outside of the place that needs some attention. The lobby is beautiful, but beyond the lobby, the place just reminds me of an aging movie star, like you can tell it used to be attractive, but now its just tired and old, and maybe staying in business beyond its prime, and the little cosmetic improvements they've done just don't hide that fact. Our rooms were on sort of an alley, a long walk from the pool. It looked like the stucco on the buildings needed to be power sprayed to get the dirt out or maybe just repainted. The building across from ours had a big gathering of pigeons on a few of the balconies, like maybe the place isn't being used. On the whole, the hotel is okay, not great. The restaurant off the lobby was good. We went there for breakfast. Again, I thought it was pricey for a has-been hotel, but the kids were happy. Now, Aunt Chilada's on the other hand, I'd heard great things about, and was looking forward to trying. Ummm... we thought the kitchen closed at 10PM on a week night, but I learned that they closed up at 9PM. We walked in at 8:57. I know this because the hostess told us that. Before \"hello\". Before \"Welcome to Aunt Chilada's\". The first thing she said was \"The kitchen closes at 9. Its 8:57.\" We asked if we should go elsewhere. She had to ask the kitchen if we could be seated, and then she begrudgingly sat us and told us that we'd have to order quickly\". Wow. Talk about uncomfortable. The food was good. Our server was great. I probably will never go back though, after that. Rustler's Roost... You will spend some money on mediocre food. The kids enjoyed ordering the rattlesnake appetizer though and it'll be something they'll remember. But, with the amount of money we spent there, that was one expensive rattlesnake memory. So, it sounds like I'm tearing up the \"resort\" in this review, and I sort of am. I'm disappointed that it really felt more like an apartment complex than a resort. I almost feel silly calling such a place a resort. I'm feeling a bit gouged by the food prices. I guess I'd be less resentful if we were treated like welcome guests and not irritating wallets. So, my advice: bring cheap flops for the pool, order pizza to eat in the room or go out beyond the resort for meals, make sure you room isn't all the way across the \"resort\" from the pool if that's where you'll be running back and forth from, bring a cooler if you need to keep things cold because the room refrigerator is stuffed with things you can purchase.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Half Moon Bay, California", "Title": "\u201cHIghs and Lows\u201d", "Author": "treetattoo", "ReviewID": "UR116179086", "Content": "I'll start by saying the exceptionally hot weather made everything seem a little more difficult on our recent road trip. Thank goodness for A/C! We had a pretty good 4 night stay here. The suite we had was a little snug for 2 adults and 2 kids but was quiet and close to the family pool and Oasis waterpark. A fridge was not available upon request but an ice machine was nearby. Very late cleaning staff (children taking 4pm naps) meant our room was not 'freshened up' 2 out of the 4 days - but I received towels and trash removal when I asked. We found the breakfast from the Lobby Grill to be very good. We also ordered from room service and the food came quickly and as hot as if we were in the restaurant. Very generous portions - no complaints about the food here at all. Most staff were friendly and helpful - I received a free shuttle ride with my kids over to the Mall when we were just too hot to be outside but needed to walk around somewhere (they have a Rain Forest Cafe in the Mall). The waterpark was a lot of fun. We had no trouble getting a shady spot and lounge chairs. My 6 year old had a blast on the slides and river - he made friends and hung out in the wave pool all day! I felt safe letting him explore, as I tried to keep my 9 month old cool, due to the quantity of lifeguards and the overall safety of the park. The food we ordered was very good, not too pricey considering, (if you want cheap, leave the resort and go to McD's) and nobody seemed to mind that I had brought a few snacks in.

The rooms are spacious, e.g. two queen beds and a pull out couch that sleeps two; very clean and very well appointed. I would compare them, favorably, to a Doubletree. The real draw, however, is the Water Park, which comprises the Lazy River, a wave pool and the not-to-be-missed water slide. Even though this was our third or fourth trip, my children never got bored. If you were to get bored, the Arizona Mills Mall is about 3 minutes away. Customer service was world class. During our second to last stay, we ran into some minor problems with housekeeping, problems which I relayed to Paul Gray, the General Manager. Mr. Gray floored me with his timely and warm response. He took complete ownership of the problem and made things right, and without hesitation. Major kudos to Mr. Gray.

I have to say most reviews were dead on. The waterpark is fine. Not very big, but didnt think it was anyway. The lazy river was decent in length with many extra water sprayers to get you wet. At times there were too many empty rafts in the river and other times it was fine. We only went on the curvy slide. My 10 year old liked it. As I get older (44) I like slides less and less. The other 2 slides were straight down pretty much. the wave pool was small but sufficient and they had a larger area to swim in with volleyball and basketball in the water. Overall the water experience was good! Of course the food prices were outrageous. Dont get the icecream. It is ice milk and too expensive. I think where this review turns bad is the room. I was warned that the rooms were older and outdated. The hallways seemed dirty, like a good power washing was needed. The carpet was not good at all. Stains and all. I made sure we all had socks on walking around the room. The bathroom was really really small. Like it was an afterthought or something. I dont understand how they could make it that small. The building name we stayed in was the Camelback. Overall, if you ask me if I would stay again, which i believe is a good way to measure, I would have to say no. This stay is very fresh in my mind because we are still here and checking out tomorrow morning. Oh yea, we did golf today, $19 unlimited golf is good, but who wants to play golf in 105 degree weather, more than 18 holes. It did cost $30 to rent clubs which is terrible. The course is nice. The first 5 holes is open and close to the interstate. The next 4-5 is threaded thru condos and such. It was nice. The back nine is all desert golf. I liked it the most.

This was our 4th visit to the Arizona Grand and the changes they have made are nice. Although the outside of the property is dated and faded the new lobby was awesome. When we arrived the room location we booked was not available so we were upgraded to a room that faced the water park. From our patio we could see the entrance to the park with a great view of the entire resort. The only complaint I would have about the room is why would the owners would spend millions of dollars on renovating the rooms to modern standards but forget the TV? The room had two televisions but they were old 19\" tube type. The room would have been perfect if it had modern flat screens. Yeah I didn't go to this resort to watch TV but do it right or don't do it at all. The water park: The park opens at 9:30 and a line of over 100 people started to form around 8:30 because shade near water is hard to find. There are lots of shaded places but they are in the center of the water park and not near the water. It would be great for a person wanting to read and relax in peace. We did not get the best spot but we made it work and we had a great time. The food/beverage service was great, fast and good. I did hear a group of people complain about the prices but the portions are huge and enough food to share. We had a few taco salads and a chicken sandwich and that was more than enough food for the 3 of us. As the day progressed the park was very crowded with tons of families with very young children. There were only a few teen/tweens so our daughter was bored and ended up going back to the room to talk on her cell phone. Things sure have changed since our daughters were small and I'm shocked how parents just let their children wander without supervision in a water park of all places. I lost count of the number of time I got hit in the head with a football or water tube while in the pool. I know it was a Saturday but I have never seen it that packed. Rustler's Roost: We went here for dinner and the place is a bit loud but we had a great view of the valley. We were told that the food here was the bomb and I assumed it was because it was so crowded and there was at least an hour wait for a table (we had reservations). The food was not all that, we tried the fried rattle snake and all we tasted was old cooking oil. I ordered the rib eye with the bone medium rare. It looked great but was tough and hard to eat. It was the worst steak I have every had so I just ate my green beans. Our daughter had the fried shrimp which she loved but the sides were gross. Our friends had the burger, the mixed grill and the chicken. My partner had the prime rib and he liked it. It was a fun experience but on my next visit to this resort I will not be going to the Roost to eat. All in all this is a great family resort that still needs a little work but I didn't stay here to watch TV and I know kids will be kids I just raised my daughters differently. One last word: At 6:00 pm on Friday and Saturday they have a dance show with young girls and one young boy from local schools to get the crowd into a party mood. It seemed like a good idea but putting teens in adult type costumes and makeup was creepy. There was a group of guys that spent all day in the pool drinking but once the show started they got out of the water and just started acting like they were in a strip club. A few said a few in appropriate comments on what they would do if they could tap that. As a father I that is was gross and we ended up leavinng.

They really try to take care of every detail. Our room was spacious and clean. Yes, they have old style tv's but with so much to do outside - why sit there and watch tv? The only complaint about the room is the pullout bed was uncomfortable. Also, they only gave us one pillow and a sheet for it when they knew we had two children. I didn't realize they didn't have a blanket until the next morning when they complained about how cold they got. Not good. We found the entire resort easy to navigate and signs everywhere telling you which was to go. The waterpark was so much fun - there is no way anyone got \"bored after 45 minutes.\" We saw people lined up an hour before it even opened so they could claim a good seat - that's how much fun it is. There are people who take the rafts and they think they own them for the day - there aren't enough for everyone to do this and it leads to lines at the lazy river and the wave pool as people are hoping to score on a raft. Meanwhile, there are rafts all over the park laying beside people's chairs as they claim them for the day (and then don't use them - running off to go down a slide,etc.). We just took those rafts off the empty chairs and used them and then left them in the water for others and I would like to see the park staff implement rules about that kind of thing. Just annoying and I shouldn't have to risk confrontation to get a park raft. There was an incident between two guests with one threatening the other. She was crazed and using profane language and the staff was quick to respond. She took off to hide but somehow they found her and as I was walking to my spa appointment - I saw her being evicted from the park. Good to know they take security seriously - especially with so many children there. The spa staff were professional and my massage appointment was on time and sooo relaxing.

I read a lot of reviews before booking our room. Some of the negative things were indeed true others were not really a big deal. If you are staying for the amenities like the water park and pools then you will likely be fine. The room had adequate space for our 4 person family. The bathroom is small but sufficient. The televisions are definitely dated and the fridge is small. The room was not completely clean when we checked in. There was a razor on a table from a previous guest and the drawer space near the fridge was dirty. The bath tub had a very slow drain leaving us standing in water for our first showers. This issue was resolved quickly and the gentleman who helped was very friendly. The food is pricey. Breakfast was definitely expensive. We did choose room service twice. Once for a late dinner strictly out of convenience and the other for a family pizza deal that was at what we considered a reasonable price. The staff was friendly and courteous. I wish they would have been more straight forward with parking details. I felt I was led to believe I had to choose or at least should choose the valet. We chose to park ourselves after the first day and it was never a bad walk. The outside of the resort is very pretty and well kept. The water park was fun and the pool was great. The pool was especially nice during the day when I assume others were visiting the water park. I called to request a ground floor room and was guaranteed one near the pool. At check-in, the room I was assigned was not ready so they gave us another ground floor room near the pool - they were very accommodating. The $30 a day resort fee is fine but should include internet service. It does not seem customer friendly to charge that and a $14.99 daily fee for internet. It is 2011, internet service should be included. The resort was in a great location for us...near the airport, interstate, restaurants and friends we were visiting. We never had to drive more than 15-20 minutes. Overall a good trip and we will consider staying here on our next trip to Phoenix. However, I will look around first.

We were charged $18 for bar food we never ordered, but the staff was very nice to promptly remove it from our bill. The best part of our stay was the night we had dinner at the 'Ruster's Roost' up on top of the hill of this resort. The hotel provides a shuttle. Dont miss it!! It's a fun country & western themed restaurant w/ free live music & even a live 'pet' bull at the entrance. Best of all they served HUGE portions ( 4 of us barely finished the onion ring basket ) & both men said the steaks were the best they'd ever eaten! Oh, and the entire wall that faced the city was all glass, & provided magnificent views of Phoenix! CONS: The layout of this hotel & its 'villa's is the worst I've ever encountered. It was a very confusing maze everywhere we went. Three adults with college degrees stayed lost most of our 4 days there lol. For instance on the map the waterpark was right behind our villas, so you'd think we could just find a path that leads straight to it. But nooooo! We walked in circles & dead end paths leading to nowhere etc. for 20 mins. before we finally found the entrance. They REALLY REALLY need to put up some directional signs!!! They had happy hour prices at the INSIDE bar only where NOBODY was during the day, yet didnt honor the same happy hour prices outside at the bar in the waterpark. One beer was around $6.50. Ouch! I read this was a huge waterpark. In reality to others I've been to it was tiny! All they had was three slides side by side, a very tiny wave pool shoulder to shoulder with people & their rafts, a tiny pool, a big hot tub, and a small lazy river which was crowded with a ton of empty rafts in our way. We'd planned on spending the whole day there, but after about 45 mins the (teen) kids were ready to leave. We went shopping instead.

I am used to Disney resorts, where if you sneeze, some one pops out from behind some secret wall to say \u2018Bless you\u201d. Was this a Disney Resort? No. But was it hell on earth? No. Do they have beautiful pictures? Yes. It is what we all do in this market when we are trying to sell our house. We arrived at 8 AM. They were more than gracious to hold our clubs for us. They offered to go ahead and check them into the system for the golfing there, so the next day all we had to do was present the claim check and our clubs would be there in just a minute or two. The lobby was empty of people that early but the Grille was busy, and it smelled good. The front desk clerks were pleasant and helpful. They got us checked in, gave us maps for the resort and some of the area. They were also helpful when I pointed out that we reserved the resort when the kids camp was free and now it wasn\u2019t. I asked for an internet credit in return and got it. We were able to get into our room at the proper check in time. We did notice that the places weren\u2019t ice cold. But we saw this at a lot of places we went to in AZ. When we brought this up to a local at the pool he told us that with the heat wave, all of the AC\u2019s were working over time. Face it, AZ is a desert. Things will be hot. Since we had two rooms, we were able to get connecting ones in the Mountainside areas. They were nice rooms, but not luxurious by any means. There was a stain on the carpet when you walked right in the door, and the fridge was a little dirty, but that was the biggest complaint about it. The coffee maker was missing, but we don\u2019t drink coffee so it really didn\u2019t affect us. The beds were soft, the pillows were nice and the bathroom was clean. The patio over looked the golf but we never really used it. We were barely in our rooms. The views were of the golf course. The water park was always busy. When we checked in we asked about the park and she told us to take advantage of it on the weekdays because the weekend would be packed. On one hand, I get that. On the other, don\u2019t sell so many extra passes to people who are not staying in the resort. We did the park on the weekdays. On Saturday we tried a different pool, the one in the building we were in. It was nice \u2013 perfect temp, clean, quiet, etc. The adult pool was also visited and same thing. I think that it would be hard to keep it perfectly spotless with all the trees around. For what they are dealing with, there were no cleanliness complaints from us. I think that for the amount of people that are there the wear and tear is inevitable, but there can be more work done. The landscape was nice, and taking a beating with the heat wave they were having. The gift shop/caf\u00e9 was ample and had the basics. I saw that it was Starbucks and asked about the pastries and was told it was Starbucks. The buffet for breakfast was amazing. The price for it was not unreasonable, seeing what all they were serving. Yes, the pool food prices were high, but that is to be expected. It is like that anywhere you go. We brought some stuff and used the \u2018cooler\u2019 in the room. But the guy at the front desk told us it was just a cooler and not a fridge. I would have been surprised to have a real fridge and a microwave since they are trying to make money on the people, but these two things might have given the resort a better vibe. There were things to do around the resort, but it was mostly golf and swimming. One member of the party tried the spa for a massage and liked it, but didn't think it was worth the price. We did the hiking in South Mountain a few mornings, but it would get hot quickly. There was a ton of things to do in the area. We took advantage of the shuttle to Rustlers Rooste, but not to the mall. We rented a car so we used that to get around. Overall, I did give the resort 4 stars. I didn\u2019t feel that it was five, but I didn\u2019t think it was three either. My thoughts would be just to clean it up a tad more in the \u2018living areas\u2019, like the hallways in the buildings, the ice areas, laundry, etc. Maybe even add the small fridge and micro.

Our room or I should say room's, were in the Villa's across from the water park. I don't know if our room was the status quo or we were upgraded due to the number people. Nevertheless, the room was beautiful! Full kitchen, dining/family room( with sofa bed), seperate master bedroom with walk in closet, and oversized bathroom( shower could fit 5 comfortably!!!). The entire unit was beautifully decorated as well as quality materils used throughout (granite counter tops. oil rubbed bronze fixtures, stainless steel appliances). We were on the first floor facing the lake with fountains. There was a french door from the family room as well as a slider in the master to the patio. We spent most of out time there at the waterpark. The kids loved it. They ordered lunch from the grill which was pricey( where isn't it?) that was good. I asked the bartender for a reccomendation for a kid friendly, no dress code, not too pricey dinner place. He suggessted the \"Rooster\" which is up the hill from the hotel. It is independent from the hotel, although you can charge your meal to your room. I called the front desk to ask if we could walk there. The reply was yes, and it would take about 10 minutes or they would send a car that would take and pick us up. We opted for the latter!( tipped the driver both ways). The Rooster was a real highlight for the kids (and me). At the entrance was a live Bull. The ambience was saw dust all over the floors, a country band with dancing, a indoor slide for the klds, and a beautiful view of the city lights and skyline. The food was excellent and well priced. The adult entree sides are served family style. The kids menu(which turns into a hat with bull horns) had a 5 or 8 0z sirloin steak, with a side and soda for $5.95. The kids loved everything about it! As did I. They bring WONDERFUL bread at the beggining of your meal and instead of a mint with the check, they bring freshly made Cotton Candy! Overall we just had a great time. The front desk people were really nice. The gal who checked us in as well as out(Tanvi) was very nice and articulate. I will also add, some how or another I got off the hotels website and booked the room from a company. I didn't notice til I pushed confirm. In my experience when you don't book direct with hotels (i.e. Priceline, expedia,etc) you don't always get the nicest rooms. Well, there was not biasedness here!

I have to say I was a little disappointed this time and will probably look at other resorts for future visits. First of all, our room rate was not all that great, and then we were hit with the $30 per night \"resort fee\" at check in. And surprise....it doesn't even include internet! The Oasis water park was nice, but crowded and over encumbered with rules and lacking more than one or two places to get in and out. This is especially a problem since the resort failed to used a walkway surface that did not absorb the 114 degree heat! Ouch! Food service was very slow and expensive. Outside food or beverages are not allowed (remember the $30 resort fee?). Our room was one of the smallest on the property, but sufficient for the three of us. However, our 19 year old daughter opted to use the pull-out sofa in the living room, and we were very surprised that housekeeping did not fold the bed up during the day but simply pulled the covers up and left it open to consume the room. Our iron did not work so we called housekeeping and asked for a replacement. It took 30 minutes to receive another iron that also did not work. A third iron was brought in about 15 minutes with the assurance it had been tested. It did heat, but when I put water in it, the water immediately drained out the crack in the bottom. We decided not to waste any more time on irons (maybe a good decision for vacation anyway, ha ha). There was a girls volleyball tournament going on in the area and several of the girls were staying at the Grand. I was very surprised that they were allowed to write cheer/spirit signs on their room windows, hang signs and crepe paper on doors etc. Sorry, I'm all for teen athletics, but I was paying for a relaxing resort experience, not a high school spirit week. We did eat at Rustler's Rooste and it was as good as ever. I highly recommend the ribeye steak and our daughter \"checked in\" at foursquare.com and she received a free ice cream sundae!

The water park is fun for the kids, I will say that. However, the grounds were poorly maintained. There were weeds everywhere around the lazy river as well as trash all over. There was dirt caked on all the the entrances to the lazy river and walkways. It looked dirty and unkempt. There were large patches of gravel and dirt, where landscaping should have been. For a resort like this, it should be pristine. The lounge chairs were dirty and looked old as well. The food was good, but overpriced. Overall, the kids had fun, but if you're an adult used to nice resorts, this doesn't even compete. There is no feeling of luxury here, just a fun waterpark with a resort is trying to compete with nice resorts in AZ, but doesn't even come close. I would definitely consider staying elsewhere like the Westin Kierland or the Hilton Squaw Peak if you're looking for waterpark fun for the kids.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cJust right\u201d", "Author": "travelwell4", "ReviewID": "UR114927354", "Content": "The staff of the Arizona Grand couldn't have been nicer.

First, this property could have been a 4-star for me because it has exceptional qualities, but the service brought the value of this property down significantly. Our initial experience was the valet. I had pulled up to the resort and my wife ran in to get details of our room etc. When she hadn't returned in a couple of minutes, I waved to the valet if my car was okay where it was with my 12-year old son inside. Anyhow, I went inside to check the status and came back out about 5 minutes later to find that valet had jumped in the car and moved it with my son inside; and without my permission! The vehicle was moved from the shade of the awning to the parking lot where the vehicle was left in full sun with my son inside and on a 114-degree day! I was absolutely livid!!! Needless to say, the supervisor said, \"Sorry, but the car was in the way.\" ...Sorry, but that was inexcusable. Next, the service by the wait staff, both at the pools and restaurants was horrible! I truly enjoyed the hotels facilities, including the state-of-the-art spa, but the service will keep me from staying or purchasing a residence at this property. I tend to enjoy many experiences away from home, but when my family was treated as poorly as this at The Arizone Grand, I will have to advise to find a property that specializes in service and not the marketing a resort advertizes.

The decorating was nice, and everything was clean. We were there in what seemed like \"off season\". I don't believe we had next-door neighbors the whole time. So things were very quiet. Bathroom was spacious with shower, double sink, and bathtub. There was a walk-in closet and plenty of dresser space. Amenities: The resort water park was neat. We only used the lazy river. Very relaxing. Only down side was there were a lot of rules. You could only get into the lazy river and one staircase, and the lifeguards yelled at you if you entered and exited in improper fashion. haha, more funny than annoying really. A great family place, there were TONS of kids. They all seemed to like the water slides alot. Water temp was perfect, and pool food was great. Lounge chairs were a little old and kind of dirty.

I'm sure it is better for younger children. My kids just wanted to hang out by the regular pools. one negative is that there are not always enough lounge chairs here. There is a great outlet mall diagonally to the right across the street from here. The name escapes me but it also has an aquarium and movie theatre.

Hotel: Like previous reviews mention, this hotel is located right next to the 10 freeway. This makes it convenient to access, but also poor in terms of scenery. The hotel itself is geared towards family and conferences. If you don't fit one of those, you really shouldn't stay here. The property is large and in relatively decent condition. We went right after the long weekend and it was perfect timing. The resort was full (mainly for a conference) but felt empty. This was perfect, so my review will reflect that. Check-in was a breeze, no lines, and everyone very friendly. Room: Due to our family situation, we looked for a resort that had suites. This one was perfect. If you have a large family (>3) you need to book one of their villa suites. We shared a 2 bedroom suite with a family of 3 (ours is 5) and it was perfect. The prev reviews that stated that furnishings were out of date must have stayed in a regular rooms. These suites had updated modern furnishings (ie: new fridge, nice countertops, flat screen tv, etc). The bath room in the master suite was huge. Shower can accommodate a small army of kids. There was a walkin closet (where the baby slept in the pack and play). We patio overlooked the 1st tee box. The room was on the 4th floor but the elevators were quick to come. The JW did not have a room accommodation like this one. So my vote for best room would have to go to the Grand. Pool/Waterpark- This was a big draw for us due to our kids. From the website, you couldn't really tell much of what to expect. There are 3 slides (all have to be 48\" to ride) which none of our kids could ride. There was a nice lazy river, but had way too many empty tubes floating in it. I can't even begin to imagine the congestion if the park was at capacity. There was also a wave pool, sports pool, small kiddie pool, and jacuzzi, and that was it. There were plenty of lounge chairs and even cabanas (can not be reserved) available. Food service was decent and prices were avg. You can only bring in water. Cons- not enough things for kids <48\" to participate in. The water rides and pools will be unbearably crowded if the hotel was at capacity. There were 25 life guards (I asked) but none seemed ready to blow his whistle at obnoxious teenagers who were running around. There is only an adult pool next to the villas and we did not go to any other pools. Compared to the JW, the pools were inferior (JW had a better kiddie area) but had better sitting area. Beaches Turks and Caicos still has the best water park Spa- According to my wife (spa expert), the facilities could not even come close to the nicer high-end resorts (including: JW, Montage, Ritz, La Quinta, etc). The massage itself was nice, but the waiting area, steam room, and shower, were not. This may be because the spa shares its facility with the community gym. The locker rooms were more \"gym/workout\" type facility. Golf- The layout was nice but the course was in avg condition. We teed off at 6:30am and was able to finish in a little over 4 hrs. The carts have GPS but no coolers. We played one day at Raven South Mountain (about 5 mins away) and paid the same amount but got a totally better experience. Golf at JW and La Quinta was better. Restaurants- This was also a little bit disappointing. We had dinner at the Lobby Grill which was avg. I heard that the rib-eye was bland. We also had dinner at Aunt Chilada which was a disappointment for a mexican restaurant. The pool side snack bar was decently priced ($7 for corn dogs, $5 for fries). Value- We paid approx $720 per night for the 2 bedroom villa. This included 2 x 50min massage/facial, 2 rounds of golf, and $100 food/bev credit per day. The resort fee was also included. Not sure if all of it was suppose to be included, but it was. This was a great value for us. One of the main reasons we chose this place. Conclusion- I loved the room set up and the convenience of playing golf and having a water park all in the same area. However, I would probably only return if I can get the same or better value than what I got. I don't like the surrounding sceneries and would prefer the JW over this.

If you want luxury, you may want to look elsewhere. Accommodations: We stayed in the Camelback building closest to the water park. The convenience was fantastic, but the clientele definitely \"family\". If you're traveling with kids, you want to pay for the rooms closest to the waterpark b/c it's worth it. Traveling for business or as a couple? Maybe opt for something in the main resort or near golf. Our building was noisy with all the kids, but we had our own child so we understood. The room layout was not ideal with a child sleeping in the room, as the sink was so close to the beds. You may consider putting kids in the living room area. Service: Service was lacking - we needed a fridge, and they wanted to charge $25 just to empty the mini-bar! I emptied it myself and put everything back at the end of our stay. They charge $15/day for internet access, which really bothered us given the already high $30 per day resort fee. Upon arrival, our room had no bar soap. We called housekeeping and had to leave a message. Eventually, someone arrived with bars of soap. Why they weren't in our room to begin with? A mystery to us! Cleanliness: Cleanliness was mediocre. Our bed & bathroom were clean, but our feet turned black after walking on the carpet. Our room felt a bit damp & had a slight mildew smell, probably from all the wet people coming in and out over the years. We set our A/C on 67 degrees to try to make it more comfortable (that worked). Someone tossed a pizza box with two slices in it by the ice machine on our floor, and it stayed there for at least TWO DAYS. Upon our departure, the pizza was still there - the birds were enjoying it. Surely they have a janitorial staff who should have picked up that trash?!? Parking: Self-parking near your room/building may be difficult to find, but luckily (unlike internet)valet parking IS included in the resort fee. But you should remember to have tips available when picking up your vehicle. The Pros: Don't get me wrong... there were PROS. The waterpark is a lot of fun! A great ammenity to have. We played all day on the slides, lazy river, and in the wave pool. We had a snack at the waterpark bar - expensive, but convenient. In the evenings on weekends, they have AZ Grand Dancers to pump up the crowd and provide a fun beach party atmosphere. AZ Grand also offers plenty of family programs including movie night (they were showing Tangled while we were there). The restaurant where we dined was very good. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. So, if you know what to expect (family resort with fun water activities), you'll do fine here. If you want more luxury or peace & quiet, ask about the more upscale rooms for business travel.

From their website I knew that children had to be at least 48\" tall to ride the waterslides. I specifically measured my son, and he was 48.75\" tall. I was not going to buy the Escape if my son could not ride the waterslides (he loves them). That was my whole reason for purchasing the getaway. When we got to the waterpark, he was much shorter than any of the signs. (I would say the signs are at 50\".) Needless to say, he was very disappointed, and so were we. When we checked out, I mentioned this and was told that next time I should go to the lifeguard office inside the waterproof, and there they have \"an accurate measure\" that I could use - and they would initial his wristband. All signs in the park should be accurate! Of course, we were checking out and could not try it out, so he never did get to use the waterpark. I sent management an email the next day, but I have still not heard back. We were very disappointed as the waterslides were our main reason for visiting the resort, and disappointed that I haven't heard anything back from them. The waterpark was fine. It only has 3 waterslides (with a 48\" minimum height), a lazy river, and a wave pool (not big waves). I think there was a baby pool too. It was crowded, but we were there Easter weekend. We ended up on very slanted grass. I ordered food at the main bar, and the food came very quickly both times. As for the resort itself, it's nice, but not 5 stars. The rooms were clean. The TVs are pretty old. Not that I care, but they are pretty grainy. I couldn't find a channel listing anywhere in the room. And in case you are looking for the remote control, it is the game controller that is hooked to the back of the TV (although I couldn't figure out how to do the volume on it.) You are supposed to get a newspaper every day as part of the daily resort fee, but we did not receive one at all. You were supposed to get coffee, and there were some packages in the room when we checked in, but no coffee maker, so we could not make any. Our Escape included breakfast in their restaurant. They have a very nice breakfast buffet that we were happy with. (For those with the Escape, they credit you $26 per day for 2 breakfasts. You can choose whatever food you'd like.) We visited Rustler's Rooste for dinner one night. I had made reservations through the resort before we arrived, and the confirmation email did say \"because of the size of your party, you will be given priority seating, to be seated before any walk-in guests.\" And that is what happened. We didn't wait long though. That place was very crowded and we were there at 6:00! Live music and a beautiful sunset and view. The food was fine, but not extraordinary. The kids will love it. The live music, there's a big slide they can slide on in the restaurant, and a live long horn bull outside the restaurant. Plus, they get a fuzzy pink special dessert. Our room was in Mountainside and you did have a little walk to the waterpark, but that was fine - we didn't mind. We also had an older room, not the ones pictured on the website. But it was fine. I wouldn't recommend trying to walk to Rustler's Rooste. It's quite a hike. And if you decide to drive, you need to drive through the resort to get to it.

For the past few years we have been traveling to Mexico.. The Iberostar Paraiso Maya., our home away from home. This year, we decided to break out of the box and do some America sightseeing with our two daughters ages 12 and 17. We spent two days in the Grand Canyon where we had a room where our expectations weren't high and then two nights in Sedona where our expectations were higher. To appease my daughters' love of comfort , I chose the Arizona Grand for the last 3 nights where my expectations were the highest and based on what we were used to in Mexico. The room was lovely; a one queen bed suite on Mountainside. The queen was extremely comfortable. The fold out couch..not so much. The terrace outside had no furniture.. so forget about hanging out there. Cleanliness was fine but when we ran out of toilet paper.... have you EVER run out of toilet paper in a premier resort?.... we were unable to get the housekeeping staff on the phone and resorted to buying our own..... have you EVER bought your own toilet paper on vacation? I hid what was left the next morning so that we might get a new roll and not suffer the same problem the next night with four people in the room. If you think that is crazy.. we had the bar of bath soap worn down to nothing by the end of the four days.with no replacement in sight. When you stay on Mountainside which is APTLY named, you have no need of the gym if you are walking back and forth from the waterpark. Let's talk about the waterpark next! This hotel was chosen due to the waterpark. It seemed similar to the Iberostar and there it did not disappoint. Lovely pools, plenty of floats, amazing slides,, plenty of towels, etc. However, we had been told by numerous employees that we could just show up by 10 am and have chaises. We have had experiences where you have to go down to the pools by 7 to reserve seats. By the time we got there.. there were NO SEATS and were told to get comfortable on the grass. Yes, it was busy season, but it seems you do indeed have to line up by 9 am for the 10 am opening in order to secure seats at the pools. Would it have really hurt one of the personnel to answer truthfully instead of saying there would be no problem. I did not pay these prices to sit on grass... grass that isn't even FLAT enough to lie on. After much searching, my older daughter and I did CARRY chaises from one side of the park to the other to cobble together a group for our family in the sun without shade. We weren't as naive the next day and were on line by 9 (and no.. we weren't first on line). You aren't allowed to bring drinks or food in to the area and even had our bags searched..NO I am not kidding. Lunch for us was almost $30 for four small milkshakes and one order of fries. The salads looked very good.. but almost $10 each. The waitresses are attentive. The personnel are extremely nice. The concierge is a doll. The resort is beautiful.. Let's talk about our experience with Rustler's Rooste.. the BBQ restaurant... We decided to avail ourselves of at least one of the hotel's restaurants. We chose Rustler's Rooste. It is at the top of a very steep hill. We wanted to take a drive after dinner, so instead of taking the hotel motor cart, we took our rental car up the hill. Once there, there is self and valet parking. My husband doesn't like to valet the car and we looked for parking. The valet portion of the parking lot is located on the same level as the restaurant. There are some other spots but with all taken, we were forced to the second level at the bottom of a very steep hill. We ended up driving back UP the hill and used the valet. Yes, to you and me this may be trivial.. but NOT to my husband. Funny thing was we were following another car that did the same exact thing. My husband would like all you car freaks out there to also know that the resort uses well water in it's sprinkler system and by the morning your car will be covered in large stains from the sprinklers. Be careful where you park if you are freaky about your car. As for the restaurant... we made 7:30 reservations, showed up 10 mins early and were given a buzzer like at some chain restaurant... REALLY? are you kidding me? Half an hour later, after listening to a great country band and seeing everyone else get seated, we asked the maitre d' when we might expect to be seated. \"Oh we are just clearing some tables\" and then ..nothing.. We asked again.. \"oh.. I'll seat you right now,\" Really? are you kidding me again? Once seated, the waitress was pleasant and the food was ok. Just ok. One more thing.. you are charged $30 extra a day for the water park, the newspaper each day (we saw it ONE day) and a few incidentals. This hotel is a RESORT.. The reason for going is the waterpark... Shouldn't this be included? OK.. so you decde you are still going.. make sure your room is closer to the pool. Bring an extra roll and your own soap. Bring your own refillable water bottles to the pool. Also.. we highly recommend Joe's Crab Shack two blocks down on Baseline. There is a Rainforest Cafe in the mall that just thrilled my daughter. No we won't be returning to this resort. We did have a good time at a beautiful place but somehow we felt truly cheated by the cost. If you would like a similar va-cay with gorgeous rooms and all food, drinks, and pools included... consider Iberostar in Riviera Maya.

Other than that minor issue, the room was beautiful. We had no issue with noise; in fact it was very quiet at night and in the morning. The rooms closest to the highway will be noisy, you're overlooking a highway! The waterpark opened at 10am each day and the line to get in was quite long, especially closer to the weekend. If you are particular about where you want to sit; plan on getting on line by 9:30am. We preferred the seats by the wave pool; you can be in the shade or the sun. Our kids had a great time at the waterpark. There are plenty of lifeguards at every attraction to ensure safety. Someone did write a review about children \"running amok\". It's a waterpark geared towards families; children will run amok! If you don't want to hear children laughing and having a good time; don't stay at a resort with a waterpark! Food service was outstanding. The back of the lounge chair had a \"flag\" that you raise when you want wait service for drinks or food. Very convenient and staff just appears when your flag is raised! The cost of food was very reasonable, some people thought it was expensive. The average cost for a meal was in the $7 - $10 range. I'm from the east coast; food here is expensive. I had no issue with food cost and everything was great. The fish tacos were the best! Breakfast and dinner in the lobby restaurant was very good. We had a prime rib buffet that included everything from drinks to appetizers and dessert for around $24 for adults. The dinner menu was nice and offered other dinner items that were very good also. The breakfast buffet was very good as well as a la carte menu items. The omelet station line was sometimes long but moved along quickly. The gym was huge and had plenty of cardio equipment and free weights. Our children loved the indoor basketball court. The spa was excellent and relaxing. A 50 minute massage was $95; very reasonable. They have beautiful trails to go for long walks along the mountains and golf course. We did see two coyotes on the golf course in the early morning and we ran in the other direction! The locals thought we were crazy; but better safe than sorry. There is a Starbucks off the lobby that offered great snacks and ice cream. The gift shop has nice knick knacks and souvenirs. Again, I thought very reasonably priced. In the evening they would show a childrens movie by the pool in the waterpark. Our kids didn't go but what a great offering. We did rent a car and drove to the Grand Canyon - a long day but worth the trip. We stopped at Red Rock state park along the way and drove through Sedona. Sedona was absolutely beautiful. It took about 3 1/2 hours to drive back to the resort from the Grand Canyon. Again, it was a long day but it was worth it. Overall, it was a wonderful vacation. We had an awesome time and would definitely go back.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, CA", "Title": "\u201cA Very Pretty Face With Some Minor Blemishes\u201d", "Author": "LMK5", "ReviewID": "UR105269483", "Content": "This resort is conveniently located off the Baseline Road exit on I-10 in Phoenix, and provides a great option for families with kids. My party was 2 adults and 3 kids, ages 10-12, and we spent 2 nights here. How did I find this place? I googled \"Best Pools in Arizona\" and this place came up on a list with others. Because of the extent of the waterpark facilities, I thought it would wow the kids. They have always wanted to stay at a hotel with a great pool, and \"wow\" is what they got. The main attraction at this resort is the Oasis Waterpark and it doesn't disappoint. We checked in early on a Thursday and the kids had half a day to check out the pools and slides. They couldn't wait to get back to it the next day. My wife got to the waterpark at 9:15 AM the next morning, but she found out it didn't open until 10 AM. Lucky for her, because there was already a line assembled. By the time the gates opened, the place was flooded with guests determined to get their chairs in the shade. I must say that there was ample seating in the facility and a surprising amount of shade to be had. My kids proceeded to spend the next 6 hours going from pool to pool, floating down the lazy river, and going down the water slides. There are lots of life guards around. There were also a couple of places to get food and drinks and the lines were never too long. College-age kids go around taking orders at your chair if desired. We stayed in a premier suite, which guarantees a golf course view. I chose this location because I wanted to be a little distance from the waterpark and didn't want to be close to the freeway. From the looks of it, I think that if you're in one of the \"M\" buildings close to the freeway you could be in for some noise. We had none. The room was large and accommodated our party well. The minibar has room enough to place a couple of items of your own if needed. A coffee maker was also provided. There was also a nice balcony with 2 chairs and a small table overlooking the golf course. Because of the great location in Phoenix, we took a short drive to Scottsdale on the second night and had a great time strolling Old Town and checking out the Friday night scene. Downsides? Well, the TVs are smaller CRTs and the channels are not as plentiful as you'd expect. I think a resort that claims 4 stars should have flat screens in all rooms. Even Holiday Inn Express has these now. Also, I noticed that the closet mirror and the French door panes had finger prints and smudges on them. Our sofabed was missing the pillow and blankets, and my wife called the desk twice to bring the items up but no one came. On the third try, she had to call the manager, and he brought the items up in minutes. Lastly, we didn't hear any voices from the neighboring rooms, but we could clearly hear their plumbing! Despite the minor negatives, this resort is a powerful draw, especially if you get a good deal. We got a nice package that included a nightly resort credit. We used it at the Lobby Grill, Aunt Chilada's, and the Market Cafe. We were pleased with each of these. I can also say that, unlike other resorts, I never felt nickel-and-dimed here. For instance, you are only entitled to 4 waterpark passes per suite but they gave me the fifth without me even asking. I also found the staff to be friendly and helpful. For families like us, who always seem to have a hard time finding a resort with rooms large enough to accommodate us comfortably, the Arizona Grand is hard to beat. You can keep the kids (and parents) very busy here, have an enjoyable resort experience, and still be close to the amenities of a major city, all at a fairly digestible cost. I would urge you to check it out.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cFun family escape!\u201d", "Author": "bigbroncosfan", "ReviewID": "UR105257850", "Content": "While my family and I had a great time I have to say I feel sorry for this resort.

(I know it is a resort but it is in the middle of a city with loads of options!) The rooms, while nice, are stuck in the late 90s. Not that we were there to watch TV but the two TVs in the room were old. They were small tube style so much so that my 5 year old didn't even recognize they were TVs. (This was a good thing in the wrong way!) Once you get past the annoyances of the resort and settle in it is fun. We enjoyed the waterpark and it is safe and clean. Despite the lines that queue at 9:15am when it opens at 10am we were able to find seats with no problems. There are many different pools that keeping everyone entertained isn't a problem. We never tried the food at the pools but it seemed ample and expensive. Our package included spa services for the adults which my wife and I enjoyed. The massages were great. However the spa itself is uninspired. The carpets are scary with big stains on them. How they got their I am not certain. Yes, we had a great time but I wanted the property to be so much more than it was. I wanted it to match the pictures.

The Villa\u2019s are very spacious, we had a king size bed with a sofa pullout, as well as a small kitchenette that was equipped with a microwave, coffee maker and fridge. The bed was more comfortable than our own at home; they provided plenty of blankets and extra pillows. We were able to spend a couple of days at the waterpark which was extremely fun. There were plenty of seating and lounge chairs to lay out and enjoy the sun. The servers were always around to get you whatever food or drink you wanted. My husband played golf on the grounds once during our stay. Our only complaint was that the lady that worked the golf scheduling was kind of rude and unaccommodating. We wanted to book the after 2/3pm special, but she kept telling us that we had to come back after 12pm to book it. We couldn\u2019t figure out if this was their way of making more money & getting you to book a more expensive morning time or what. When he was finally able to get a tee time, it ended up being in the morning, we ended up going through the gentlemen that works there which happened to be much friendlier. Overall, we had a great time & the resort provided plenty of activities to keep us busy. Our best experience there was going on the family hike. It was about 5 miles, lasted a couple of hours & we had a blast. Best of all, it was free. The views were extremely beautiful!

The one thing that wasnt so incredible are the rooms, yes they look somewhat like the web, however they are not nearly as roomy and the pullout sofa is extremely uncomfortable. I have to say after all the investigation into many properties I was extremely dissapointed, the rug was stained and on the border of disgusting.

The service was the best we have ever seen. It started when we pulled up to the valet and they were able to store some almond milk for us in their fridge (my stepson is dairy free). Although our room was not ready, they checked us partway in, gave us the wristbands necessary to access the park, and then directed us to the spa and let us use the locker rooms to change into swim suits. The food at the park is a tad expensive, but the service is great. Both my stepson and I have [different] food allergies and they accomodated us as well or better than some restaurants I have been to. We got to our suite and it was just as advertised. Actually, the great service started months before when I called to make the reservation and the agent gave us a suite in the closest set of rooms to the water park, which also has two pools and a hot tub of its own. The outer room had it's own sink, so except for shower and toilet my stepdaughter essentially had her own room. Each room had its own TV, although we never turned them on. The next day was heaven. Our food issues were again handled elegantly by the waitstaff and floating around the lazy river was a highlight for all of us. We never got up the nerve to try the two big water slides, but all four of us found the lower twisty turny slide a great deal of fun. The water in the wave pool was like a bathtub and the inner tubes all over the place made for a lot of fun. When we locked ourselves out of our room, a bellman came in 3 minutes(!) to let us in. My husband enjoyed the fact that they let you use the driving range for free. We loved that, except for the price of the food, we never felt nickeled and dimed. There were no hidden charges at the water park, the inner tubes are there for anyone to use and there are plenty of them. The number of lifeguards around is astonishing. They are located about every 20 feet along the length of the lazy river and they switch stations every 30 minutes so they can stay attentive. They all seemed very nice as well. Gently correcting kids who were doing the wrong thing rather than yelling. We felt completely safe letting the 9 year old go around the lazy river by himself.

The AGR exceeded our expectations in many ways despite the overlap with the expected Spring Break traffic. As with any hotel, there are strengths and weaknesses however, there were several aspects that are undeniably EXCEPTIONAL for a resort of this size, quality, and price point. Located within a short drive to Sky Harbor airport, the resort is off the beaten path of the typical Scottsdale 'name' resorts. What you get for that is a lack of pretentiousness, more attention to the guest, and very good value for your dollar. A car is necessary to explore Phoenix and the vicinity. The hotel staff was all so very helpful, polite, and willing to go out their way to assist guests. Having stayed at the Arizona Biltmore, just 3 weeks earlier, I said that the level of attention between the two was equivalent but without the \"white glove\" service. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised at the prompt nightly turn-down service with towel exchange that was M.I.A. at the Biltmore where I paid twice the nightly rate (do you hear that Biltmore?) Also, reasonable room rates plus the Grand Experience which gives you $100 per room per night credit toward virtually any expense on property. How's that for a deal. The water park was a welcomed haven for the kids, with attentive lifeguards at the wave pool, lazy river, and 3 waterslides. Can't say that I didn't catch just a few adults indulging themselves at the water park. After several strenuous laps in the Lazy River, I was ready for poolside service from the friendly waitstaff. The traditional pools adjacent to the rooms were more than adequate, quieter, and offered a nice change of pace from the water park. Admission to the park is included in the price of the room and is not open to the public ...another plus. So if the food and drinks are a little pricier...it still doesn't come close to Disney prices. The 18 hole golf course was very playable and well maintained. The hole design was varied with sweeping changes in the mountainside terrain making it very scenic and challenging. Rates were very reasonable especially with the additional 20% discount offered to hotel guests. My 9 year old son loved it and begged for more playing time. The driving range was adequate and free to use with lots of kids taking advantage of the kid friendly range. And best yet, children 12 and under play golf for free! Yet another pleasant surprise! We signed up for a twilight round at 3:26pm and were given the green light to go off at 2:30pm for the same price. The rooms are typical suite design with a bedroom with king or 2 queen plus a living area with a pull out queen. This was a former Hilton property. A mini bar refrigerator and wet bar was useful. The rooms are nice and more than adequate, but who comes to Phoenix to stay indoors? The mattresses on the sofa beds could use an update. TV's are not flat screen but with 2 per suite, they do the job. Finally, as a self-proclaimed foodie I was pleasantly surprised by the menu items at the resort restaurants. During our trip they offered not only children's menu items but had priced fixed specials such as Prime Rib Night. Honestly, possibly the BEST, tastiest, and enjoyable prime rib I have ever eaten. Though the portions are not huge like one would find at an upscale steak house, they were more than enough for my hungry appetite (come on America do we really need to super-size?). Dinner included a buffet of iceberg lettuce wedge, creamed spinach, potatoes, vegggies and dessert all for $ 21.95 . Outdoor dining and coctails by 2 fire pits and with beautiful views of the golf course. Food service during the Spring break holiday was slow but the maitre d' informed all the guests up front that the kitchen was swamped and that they would not be seated until the kitchen caught up. Although the hunger was upset I appreciated the honest candor up front. Bravo again ! The spa and gym were very modern in a beautiful building and the parking was free all over the resort. This resort is a virtual 'diamond in the rough'. And believe me, I spent 5 days in the rough during my golf tournament... I know rough :-) ! Apparently with the new management making renovations like the new central lobby, restaurant, Starbuck's and golf shop I'm sure that as the economy improves, so will the updated amenities. If my three world travelers ages 9, 9 , and 7 give the AGR a big thumbs up for a return trip and momma reluctantly left the resort to go home with a big smile on her face, you know that they are doing alot of things right . We will certainly consider a return visit. Although a paradise for children, the Arizona Grand Resort has plenty for adults without children too!

All rooms are at least a 1 bedroom suite (great if you have kids with you!) with a small refrigerator (no charge to use) and a pull out sofa bed in the living area.

The grounds are beautiful and the resort has it's own WaterPark with a lazy river, waterslides, and giant wave pool that is popular with adults and children alike. Although it can get very busy, there are many, many lifeguards around to keep a close eye on things, and the wait stuff does a fantastic job of making sure your requests are met in a timely and friendly fashion. While we were there, kid friendly movies were shown in the evenings out by the pool for some handy free family entertainment. We've eaten at the main hotel restaurant several times and the food has been quite good. Prices are fairly typical for this caliber of a resort. Do yourself a favor on a hot day and stop in the marketplace for their homemade gelato...delicious!

Despite the upscale nature of the hotel, our family feels completely comfortable here. The staff is extremely gracious and will go out of their way to help you with any request. At some higher end resorts, I have run into attitudes from staff members, but never here! It is a very family friendly and delightfully accommodating place to stay.

The location is great, you can get to most of the main attractions in under 20 minutes....or just stay at the resort and enjoy all it has to offer.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cBest.

Beware: The staff will full-blown rummage through your pool bag to be sure you are ABSOLUTELY not bringing in any snacks or drinks of your own. They even took my son's snack back of Teddy Grahams away from him. They have pool service for food or drink. Beers are $5.50 a piece and mixed drinks are $9-$11. Food is like bar food (Hotdogs, Corndogs, Chicken Tenders, Wraps) and there is no kids menu. We stayed in the Resort Room (I think the lowest rate one). It's a nice layout to have a small living room and bedroom. The TV's in these rooms have to be from the 1990's. They are 19\" TVs and have no hook-up for DVD players or any electronics. Bathrooms are like motel room bathrooms. Nothing fancy about the rooms. Lobby Restaurant was good. Wide range of pizza, steaks, burgers, and a kids menu.

I thought it must of been an upgraded room,but no, we were in the same room all 3 nights, just our Wed. stay was 100 more and no package deal. Even Jacquelynn at the front desk thought it was odd to be paying so much more for the one night,she tried to get us a deal,but the manager would not budge. At least she waived the resort fee of 30 dollars. She was excellent. Be aware that the 30 dollar resort fee is tacked on to every room so our room on Wed. ended up being $369 total and the other 2 nights were around $290,this is after the $100 resort credit. It is definitely not worth it, you have to pay extra for the WiFi, which you don't expect after paying so much.We found a Barbie leg in our room and the TV's didn't work half the time. The resort itself is beautiful and the resaurant o.k. The water park is nothing spectacular, we stayed at a hotel in Wis. which had a water park and it was far superior to this one. My kids laughed at the wave pool,they kept waiting for the waves. They have 3 slides, one good for everyone, the other 2 are so steep that it ripped my husband's suit to shreds. If their lazy river was anymore slower it would be laughable. Nice hot tub though. The staff was helpful and friendly, but not worth the money.

We were told the hotel was renovated about 2 years ago, but the rooms still looked a little dated to me (carpeting and bathroom wallpaper showing signs of wear). While the suites are a decent size with a separate living room, there is a major problem with the layout. The vanity area (which is outside of the bathroom) is right at the foot of the bed in the bedroom with no divider. Therefore if one person wants to get ready without waking the others, it would be darn near impossible. The vanity lights shine right on the bed, never mind the sound of running water right in the bedroom. I've never seen this layout in a hotel before. Also, the bathroom was very small. You had to open the door all the way, walk in, and then get out of the way (due to toilet placement) before you could close it. Yes, the televisions were also small and older, but I didn't really care about tv when I\u2019m on vacation. The grounds are scenic with the mountains in the background. There are lots of gas firepits burning around the property. The staff was very responsive. You can request a golf cart ride (response time was great) to any part of the property you wish to visit, although it\u2019s easily manageable on foot as well. The waterpark was very clean and the perfect size. It is certainly a nice amenity to have with children and teens. However they forbid you to bring \"any snacks\" into the water park and check your bags. I had to leave a bag of pretzels at the desk. I felt like a criminal. We intended to have lunch there and I just wanted something to tide the kids over until then. We did have lunch from the Oasis Grill and the food was good. The waitresses were very responsive. Put the flag up on your chair and they are there. The next day they must have had my name \"tagged\" in their book and asked me if I remembered their outside food policy? Again, I felt like a scofflaw. My husband used the golf course and said it was nice but he said the golf cart and clubs he rented were aged. The nail technician at the spa was great. However, the spa itself looks like its in need of updating. My husband enjoyed the fitness center. Since we had the Grand Experience package which allowed us a $100/night credit to use at the resort, we ate at Aunt Chilada's one night. The food was mediocre at best and the service was a little slow.

We were on a package that provided a $100/resort credit a day which was really convenient; especially because the food and beverage at the water park were a bit overpriced (about $15 for a burger and fries) and they won't let you bring your own food/drink into the park. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and modern. We really appreciated having 2 queens in a bedroom with the sofa sleeper in the living room. Worked great for my 10 and 7 year olds because they didn't have to share a bed and we could close off part of the unit for anyone that was sleeping late. The mini bar was nice since we had a refrig. but it would be a great addition to include a microwave in the room. We enjoyed some lazy days by the resort pool outside or room and also enjoyed lots of time at the waterpark. The pool outside our room was nice because we coulde easily access our room for food or beverage that we bought at the grocery store about 1/2 mile away (it is walk-able). As a bonus, since we went in Feb, the pools and waterparks were empty! Although it was cool outside, the pools were heated nicely and the hot tub was a life saver! I only have a few complaints about the water park. First, I'm told the 2 big slides hurt! I love water parks but not once did I go on the big slides because in watching people go down, rarely did anyone go a second time. My kids usually live on water slides but they only enjoyed the 2 big ones a handful during the whole week. They loved the lazy river and wave pool. My second complaint is the lifeguards are so strict. If my son even goofed around at all in the lazy river, he was in trouble. You couldn't take a beverage in the tube and couldn't \"slip in\" just anywhere, even if a tube was floating by. Plus, you had to be in a tube at all times. Desipte this, we had an outstanding time and we'd definitely return. We loved the pizza in the lobby bar and had fun at the Roost cowboy bar/restaurant. The fitness center was also very nice. I also loved that the facility backed up to the Pima National Reserve. After breakfast each day, I could take a run in the reserve to burn off my meal and enjoy the outdoors.

We picked a beautiful looking resort, located in southern Phoenix, close to golf courses and restaurants. It looked great in the pictures and the room descriptions promised bright, sunny rooms over looking pools and the resort golf course. We arrived late at night for an 8 night stay - not the longest stay they've had, I'm sure, but not a quick weekend, either. We were led by golf cart to our building - Camelback- and we were pleased with the 2 room aspect of the suite, but then I opened the curtains! We were level with ( and could have reached out and touched from the tiny, unusable balcony) a car in the carpark and our view was a huge back door and garbage cans. I had spent weeks dreaming of sitting out on the balcony enjoying our morning cup of tea and soaking in sunshine and the surrounding vista. Not from this room! I did cry myself to sleep that night, I was so disappointed. The next morning I went to the front desk and told them this room was not at all as expected. They replied that they could give me a room higher up in the same building that overlooked the water park -for an additional $20 per day. This on top of the $30 resort fee plus extra taxes on both meant the hotel cost us more than $400 over what we had already prepaid expedia. The room was nice and clean but when families started arriving the next weekend to use the water park the noise was incredible. The televisions were old and small and there was just nothing special about the room at all. I guess after staying at the Pacific Terrace Hotel in San Diego, the Bellagio in Las Vegas and even the Peppermill in Reno - this resort just didn't impress us. I really resent being held for ransom to receive what should have been provided in the first place!

It will literally drive you insane trying to navigate the resort as the footpaths tend to dead end at the various complexes, while the roads for cars seem to get you where you need to go quicker. The standard rooms are billed as suites, which they are - but only at the sacrifice of any room in the bathrooms (which are so small, the sinks are placed in the bedroom area). Beware of your room rate, there is a resort fee added on top (which is completely acceptable, but it doesn't include internet, which is an additional $15/day per device. So you can't use the same wifi access with your phone as the one you are using for your laptop.). I think this resort probably works best for families (as I'm sitting in my room listening to a monster session of Marco Polo in the pool). Parents probably like the resort feel, while the kids can probably spend all day at the attached mini-water park when it's open in-season).

As another reviewer said, it is nice but not of the caliber of some of the other hotels in the Preferred Group. We had a package which included a $100 resort credit.

Internet is approximately $15 per day and there is no free wi-Fi anywhere on site. (Most places at least have it in the lobby if you don't want to pay to have it in your room). The $100 per night credit is use it or lose it per day, i.e. you don't get to carry it over to the next day if you don't use it up on the preceding day. If you can get a good room rate, this is a convenient location. The Oasis water park is very nice but not open at this time of year (which we knew ahead of time). Other pools were open.

We arrived at the resort a few hours ahead of the check-in time, but we were able to get a room upon our arrival. That room had some issues and we were immediately upgraded to a villa room, which was greatly appreciated! I would have been disappointed if we weren't provided with an upgrade given the issues -- the upgrade shows that the resort cares about the guests. Our villa room had an amazing view of the golf course and waterfall area (slept with our balcony door open every night to hear the water) -- it was also very nicely decorated, had a refrigerator and microwave, and a very comfortable bed. I recommend buying some groceries at the Fry's less than .5 miles away on Baseline (not the one across from the resort as that is a Fry's Electronic store). We heard about some issues others had with \"standard\" rooms, but again, the villa room was exceptional! We liked the villa room so much that I researched the cost of purchasing one -- about 70% of them are already sold including, unfortunately, the one we stayed at. The early check-in provided us with an opportunity to use the waterpark -- we certainly enjoyed it!! It was only open for that day (Saturday) during our stay. I don't understand why it couldn't have been opened on Sunday too, but we weren't expecting it to be opened at all so at least we had a few nice hours there. The water park was a very nice amenity for the resort guests -- we are already thinking about returning when it is open more. I like the fact that it is only open for resort guests! The other amazing aspect of this resort was the fitness facility -- the best I have ever seen at a resort. It easily compares to any private workout facility out there. Shooting baskets was a nice break. I wanted to use other aspects, but decided to be lazy instead. We didn't use the spa so I cannot comment on that area. We also enjoyed the fire pit areas outside of the main lobby -- very nice section to relax at. We have stayed at some other resorts in the Phoenix area (e.g., Camelback Inn) and the Arizona Grand Resort, with a villa room, certainly compares favorably to the others. The only area of improvement would be to have some floats available to use at the pool areas.

The grounds were beautiful. Check-in was smooth and efficient and they golf-carted us over to our building in Camelback. If you're interested in the waterpark, stay in Camelback. It's much closer. Our room was clean and spacious and overlooked the waterpark. The one problem that we had in the room was that the drain in the bathtub was slow. We called guest services about it then went to dinner; it was fixed by the time we got back. If you have small kids, I would recommend going during the week.

Just something for the parents to keep in mind if you're going over a weekend. Also, if you go during the summer off-season, keep in mind that not all of the attractions are open all the time. Because of the limited number of lifeguards, they alternate when the slides and the lazy river are open during the week. On the weekends, they had both open. The food was decent. Aunt Chilada's was above average Mexican food. Rustler's Roost was fun! Do take the shuttle up there, though. It's at the top of the hill and kind of a hike in the heat.

My wife and I are both 29, my daughter is 3, so my view is from that perspective. Nightly Rate / Resort Fees: When planning the trip, we got a priceline rate of $100 per night. What is not blatantly disclosed, but I knew from online research is that the nightly rate does NOT include the resort fee of $30 plus tax. This was also not discussed by the front desk agent on checkin, so I kept my mouth shut to see what would happen, but as expected, $30 per night additional tacked on for the resort fee. The only place this was disclosed in my experience with the hotel was in the little folder they gave me my room keys in - it has a printed card labeled \"resort fees\" and lists the things the fee is meant to cover. Now, dont get me wrong, I am not by any means disputing the resort fee because I know it is an \"across the board\" charge to all guestrooms, but if you are going to go to the trouble to list in print what the fee covers - I would be making real sure all the amenities listed are provided. In our case, the daily newspaper made it one time during our 4 night stay, and the in room coffee was provided as often as I was willing to call and ask for it. I'm really not that disappointed about either of these things, and it certainly didnt negatively impact our trip, but I'm just pointing out that 2 of the things \"covered\" by the resort fee, in our experience, weren't handled well. Checkin: We arrived on Thursday at about 12:30pm and checked in with no problem. We were \"upsold\" for $20 per night additional to be closer to the water park and pool areas. I agreed - so that is a self inflicted problem. I probably should have just requested to be close and see what they gave me because we had another party join us on saturday, and they simply asked to close to our room and were accommodated without any nightly \"upgrade charge\". Again - I agreed to it and we truly did enjoy our room location, so it really isn't conversation worthy aside from possibly pointing out that the front desk really may have more flexibility for location than my check in agent led me to believe. One other thing, we agreed to the \"green\" program in exchange for $30 of dining credit for our 4 night stay. This meant that we would not receive daily maid service, but still had access to additional linens, etc upon request. No complaints with this program or implementation (just dont forget to use them - they are physical coupons) - great idea though - wish more places would do it. Our Room: We were in suite C231 (Camelback). We found our room very adequate and entirely clean. Other posters have commented the rooms seem \"old\" - I disagree with that - the rooms have clearly been remodeled, and ours had modern, comfortable furniture. The TVs are still traditional tube televisions, but they do work, and I certainly dont dock the hotel points for not having flatscreens everywhere. Now, in some other posters defense, the TVs do certainly make the room feel \"older\", but they are completely functional. Oasis: The oasis is a really cool park, but I can certainly see that older children & teenagers might run out of things to do somewhat quickly. The water park doesnt really have that many different attractions - 1 basic water slide, 2 thrill ride water slides, the lazy river, the zero entry wave pool, the sports pool, the hot tub, and the childrens area - \"wildcat springs\". Now, for us with a 3 year old - everything was perfect. We got there right when they opened every day at 9:30, stayed through lunch, then went for nap during heat of the day. Thursday and Friday the park was empty. There was one point where we were literally the only people in the wave pool, but Saturday and Sunday were PACKED. People on those 2 days lined up starting at 8:00 outside the gates to get a spot. The food at Oasis was good (not great), and fairly pricey. I'm not going to beat them up too much about the their prices as their prices aren't out of line from other resorts Ive stayed at, but their food could stand some improvement. Some things were great - others were mediocre at best. Everything is A-La-Carte. $8.00 Sandwich comes with nothing. $9.00 Burger comes with nothing. Fries are $4.50 extra. Salad was great, burger was thin and just OK - it was fine though. Food was certainly not a high spot for Oasis, but it wasnt bad either and is in line with the food quality foudn throughout the rest of the resort. As far as the weekend crowd - hotel seemed to handle crowd control pretty well. Sure, everything was busy, but that's not really the hotels fault. In addition to being busy - there were some partiers in the central courtyard pool until about 10 - 10:30 every night. Doesnt bother me, but if you go to bed early - it was pretty noisy. Other food: We ate at the \"marquee\" restaurants - The steakhouse called the Rusters Roost has really cool atmosphere. Our server, Brian, was very friendly and made for a great time. The food was great EXCEPT for the steak (unfortunate since it is a steakhouse). The bread, salad, corn, beans, green beans, apple pie, cotton candy, etc were all excellent, but the steak just really was somewhat bland. The place is really cool, has great atmosphere, and has a band playing - we all enjoyed it, but 5 people at our table got steak and all agreed the steak was the weak link of the meal. Aunt Chiladas is a total flop. Our server was dry, unhelpful, the food was mushy, bland, and just generally not good. We had some drinks - they were OK I suppose, but this resort serves drinks everywhere - go somewhere else. We were one of only a few tables in the entire restaurant eating - now I see why. This place has disaster written all over it - dont waste a vacation night on this place. Room service was good and as described - as others have posted, be aware that there is a 23% gratuity plus $3.00 fee added for room service. Breakfast is the hit of this hotel - the lobby grill has the most perfect breakfast patio ever. We ate there every morning. The servers are friendly and the food was good, both off the menu and the buffet. Our 3 year old buffet was free with an adult buffet, so morning they offered the buffet we opted for that. All in all, we really did have a great time. The food is certainly not for people who travel to experience the great eats of the world, but for our family of three, we had a wonderful time and everything was more than adequate for our needs. The staff was very friendly and always made us feel welcome. I think we would go again, but not so sure it would be our pick once our kids were older, or if it was just the 2 of us having a romantic weekend. Hope this helps and/or offered some insight for anyone considering this place.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gilbert, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cI left the resort relaxed and in a great mood and ready to attack my Monday.\u201d", "Author": "robnikkki", "ReviewID": "UR77753096", "Content": "August 21, 2010-It has been a little over a week since we have been home from our Stay-cation at the Arizona Grand Resort. This was not our first time staying at the resort, we try to make it there for a family weekend at least once a year. We are still talking about our visit. We have some dear friends that also like the Arizona Grand, yet we are never able to go at the same time. This year we made a pact that we were going together. \u00a0We both have daughters about the same age so we were looking forward to a great time.\u00a0 When we got there we were greeted by very friendly staff, we waited in line to get our rooms and the relaxation was starting to already set in. We were all ready for a fun time. \u00a0When we got to our adjoining rooms we realized that there was a maintenance issue in our room. I do not consider this the fault of the resort, things do break. The only reason that I would be an unhappy guest is the way that that the situation was being handled. In this case I was not an unhappy guest. \u00a0 I called the front desk and in a few minutes someone was at our door working on the issue. It was determined that this was not going to be a quick fix. I contacted the front desk and spoke to the Manager, Ryan Moyer and explained the situation. He was all about making sure that we were taken care of. \u00a0 I explained to him that we had our best friends in the next room and that we would need to move together as this was a group trip. \u00a0He asked if he could call me back after he had a solution for us. A few minutes later, Ryan called and said that he was going to be moving us and that a bell-person would be coming up to move all of our luggage. A few minutes later a friendly staff member came with our new room keys and we were off. Ryan apologized for the problem in our room and said we would be happy where we were being moved to. We were, the rooms are great and we actually were a bit closer to the park. Ryan got us rooms that were attached which really made for a fun time.\u00a0 \u00a0The service was outstanding! You can tell that the staff really cares about the guests. I am surprised by some of the reviews that said the staff was rude because we experienced nothing but hospitable, friendly and over-the-top service throughout the entire complex. \u00a0We all enjoyed our breakfast in the restaurant. The majority of our group are all \"Bacon Freaks\" the bacon that was served with our breakfast was delicious! It was not your typical thin as paper bacon, it was thick, crisp bacon. The price for the breakfast was very reasonable. The fresh squeezed orange juice was not served in a 4 ounce glass, which I appreciated. The small loaf of bread served with my breakfast was a nice touch. The water slides are so much fun, this time we decided that this was going to be a very relaxing \"lazy River\" adventure. \u00a0I will say that as a parent, I appreciated and noticed the park's attention to safety. They had plenty of people working around the slides, the pools and the beach and the lazy river. . Also, this is a very clean water park,\u00a0usually I am not a fan of water parks because they don't seem very clean to me.\u00a0 The water was so clean and clear, it was great. This was a fun and relaxing Stay-cation. I left the resort relaxed and in a great mood and ready to attack my Monday. The Arizona Grand Resort was a great experience!

The water park is good on the weekdays, but on weekend it\u2019s way too crowded. The lazy river requires everyone to be in an inner tube but there is not enough tube available. Those that manage to get a tube walk around the water park all day hanging on to the inner tube despite being constantly reminded on the loud speaker not to remove the tubes from the water area. Bars and eating area are filled with people having a drink but yet still want to hang on to the tubes.

They have Island Night Buffet; it\u2019s a table consisting of salads, chicken nuggets and tater tots for $16.95 per person.

No innertubes were available, and you can't ride the Lazy River without one. So we hiked over to the Wave Pool which was Wall to Wall People standing in slighly choppy water. Thinking the waves would soon begin we waited,... the water went completely still. We realized that the choppy waters are considered 'Waves' in this Water Park. This was a bad joke in comparison with other Wave Pools we have experienced. Knowing that the pool closed at 8, we decided to get out about 7:30pm and went in search of our lounger/personal belongings and towels. The loungers had already been stacked and TOWELS GONE, our bag & lounger sat alone in the grass. We left cold, wet and insulted!

The waterpark itself is very nice and never seemed crowded. The real minus point for us was the constant noise which might be due to having been assigned a room on the main floor but also the layout of the resort which meant that many rooms were facing the courtyard which in our case had another smaller pool. It felt like being in a big apartment complex with constant noise going on into late at night. This might all be just personal and seeing other reviews this seems to not have been an issue with others. We were probably spoiled by our previous stay at the resort in Scottsdale which was quite the opposite. It was a one story resort with beautiful grounds, a nice pool and literally no noise.

I have two wonderful daughters, 6 and 4. We traveled to the Arizona Grand in mid-July. After many hours of scouring the internet for a nice hotel, this seemed to be the place to go. Let me give you some practical, honest input on this resort: 1. The heat. I am from San Diego. I hadn't read too many reviews that detailed whether small kids could take Phoenix's stifling heat. Rest assured, your kids will be fine. My kids, surprisingly, almost made no fuss about the heat. In a way, it was kind of fun trying to avoid the heat. The cool thing (no pun intended) about Phoenix is that it's always warm. We made sure to swim in the early morning or early evening, around 6, to avoid the suns direct rays (and to avoid getting sunburned). It you go out to the pool at 9 a.m, it's already 95 degrees. However, the sun isn't high in the sky, so you don't get scorched by its direct rays. By the same token, we hit up the water park late in the day, when the suns direct rays weren't real bad. All pools and the waterpark had bathwater, warm water (ahhh!!!). 2. How was the water park? It looks fabulous on the internet, but kids under 7 will be too scared to ride the slides. There are only three slides, with two of them being 7-story dropouts (fun for adults!). This was disappointing, as I was hoping for more slides for the kids. There is one tame slide that kids might be able to go down, but they don't let kids slide down with their parents. That's too bad. My daughters would have gone if they could have slid with me, but they were too scared to go alone. I get tired of hotels and water parks assuming that a catastrophe will occur if an adult slides down with their children. It won't. If the resort reads this, I highly recommend that you change this policy. Otherwise, your small children will not be able to use any slides. My daughters would have likely spent hours going down this one slide with their mom and dad if this rule wasn't in place. To be honest, I thought that they would at least have one or two slides for smaller kids. Nope. Kind of hard to believe. Aside from the slide, they have a wave pool. This was cool. Both of my daughters enjoyed it. The wave pool was about half the size of any wave pool that you'd find at a Knotts Soak City or any other wave park. It was fun. They also have a lazy river. It's your typical lazy river. There is also a separate pool for general frolicking or volley ball playing. It was about 5 feet deep. Nothing great, nothing bad. The water was pleasantly warm. They have a VERY nice toddler pool. My kids aren't toddlers, but, if you have a child that is just walking, or maybe up to 2 years old, the toddler pool is fantastic! It is about the size of a large, backyard pool. Not huge, but a fairly decent size, and get this: The deepest part is 1 1/2 feet deep! Totally safe! On top of that, they let parents put the poolside chairs into this toddler pool, so they can actually sit in the pool while their toddler plays. If you have toddlers, this pool, alone, would probably make the trip worth it. You don't ever find 1 1/2 pools at hotels. All-in-all, I would give the waterpark a 6 1/2 on scale of 10, but don't be dismayed. The pools within the hotel make the visit worth it, even if the waterpark is only pretty good. If they would let the parents slide with the kids, it would bump it up to 7 1/2. They actually need to put a few slides in for kids. I wish they had a few slides similar to what the Great Wolf Lodges have for kids (If you haven't been to a Great Wolf Lodge, then you have TOTALLY missed out on the best place to take kids 10-and-under). 3. Redemption for the waterpark. The waterpark TOTALLY redeems itself on weekend nights. Starting at 6, they have a DJ and dancing. Some people have complained (What???). The music made for a VERY festive atmosphere. My wife and daughter got out to dance, while me and my other daughter lounged in the wave pool. It got better at 8 p.m., when a giant screen came down and they played a Disney movie. IT WAS FANTASTIC! Everybody sat on rafts in the big pool and watched. It was wonderful. It was the perfect night. 4. The interior pools saved the day! We spent more time swimming in the pool in our hotel courtyard area, than in the water park. It was a very large pool and the water temperature was bathwater warm (ahhhhh!). We usually waited until after 7 p.m. to swim. At this time of day, the sun was behind the building, so you weren't in direct sun light. My daughters would usually swim for about 2 hours. The deepest part was only 5 feet, and this was in the very middle of the pool. Yes, they do allow floaties. 5. The rooms were very nice and very large. I was actually impressed with them. I have stayed at a lot of hotels. It was nice. The beds were very comfortable! The air conditioner was in fine form. We usually kept our room in the high 60s! 6. Other. The hotel is about 1/2 a mile from the Arizona Mills mall. We spent several afternoons at the mall, to avoid the mid-day heat. We had a lot of fun. The food court was large and pretty cool, and had a large merry-go-round. Also, there's a movie theater next to the food court. Also, they have the Sea Life Aquarium at the mall. The Sea Life Aquarium isn't an all-day activity (more like 1 1/2 hours). It's NOT Sea World, or anything close to it, but it's not bad. It's a little pricey ($17 adults, $9 for kids), but it's not a bad place to go. As for the mall, they have tons of actual outlet stores where you can actually get real bargains. Something unheard of in San Diego. Very nicely decorated mall. It sounds kind of pathetic to suggest that hanging out at a mall is part of a vacation itinerary, but, when you are trying to avoid the heat, it's oddly kind of fun! 7. Other ideas. I would recommend the Museum of Natural History for one afternoon. I am not much of a museum guy, but this one was fantastic! My daughters LOVED it. It completely outclassed any museum in San Diego. 8. Bummers. There weren't too many negatives about the hotel, but there were a few. First, there is no free internet service (it's $14.95 a day). But that's not bad, as it keeps you off the internet. Also, they don't have any luggage carts! What? I was too cheap to pay the clerk to take my luggage to the room. When I got to my hotel courtyard, I found out that there are no luggage carts. The hotel needs to supply luggage carts. Next, there are no microwave ovens in the room, but we called the desk and they brought us one! All-in-all, this was a very nice place to stay.

Room was not as nice as I would expect for the price, and like I mentioned before, there was no elevator. T.V's were 20+ years old and I'm not exaggerating at all. I looked at the back of them for the manufacture date because I couldn't believe how old and terrible they looked. The bedroom T.V. was blurry and unwatchable.We wanted to order a movie for the bedroom T.V. but could not because the picture was terrible. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone out to look at / fix the T.V. 45 minutes later nobody had showed up, I called again and they said they would radio someone and get them there fast. 15 minutes later no one had showed up so I called the front desk again and told them to forget about it now because we were exhausted and ready for bed by then. It was definitely nothing but lip service. I don't think the T.V. was fixable, it just needed to be replaced with a model that isn't 20 years old. The $30 per night motels have nicer T.V's than this RESORT!! They charge you $15 per day for internet access so we didn't use it, a $30 resort fee which I assume is for the water park. Water Park was massively crowded with limited pool loungers. The water park grounds are not nearly as spacious as they look in the pictures, there are a lot of things left out in the pictures so it looks more open and inviting. Good luck finding a place to sit and relax if you are not there first thing in the morning when they open. There was a 15 minute line in the morning to get into the water park because they are so busy rifling through everyones bags to make sure nobodys bringing ANY outside food or beverage. We are obviously not the only people unaware of this. Every time I came in or left the park they were scolding and confiscating items from some other unfortunate/clueless person about the same thing.They absolutely gouge you in every way possible. They don't tell you when you book the room that you can't bring in any snacks, water, or other outside food and beverage to the water park. It makes for very expensive days with the kids.There were lines for the slides and even lines to get a tube to get on the lazy river, it was rediculous. Upon checkout we were not asked how our stay was, were not offered an apology, and were not offered any concessions/credits for the trouble we experienced. We have stayed at a few Scottsdale Resorts in the summer like Westin Kierland / JW Marriot that are much nicer and a much better overall value, places that genuinely seemed concerned about your happiness.

We stayed 2 nights and the whole idea of staying here was to simply relax and end the vacation at a place where the kids could just play at the water park all day. We stayed 2 nights in a Mountainside Suite, and the property itself was fantastic. The walk to Oasis is not long at all, so don\u2019t feel like you need to pay extra to stay in a Sedona or Camelback Suite because they are closer. It\u2019s really not an issue. The rooms were very nice and well kept. The grounds were kept tidy. And Oasis was very fun for the kids. They didn\u2019t get out of the water for 2 days. But I do think the lazy river could be kept a bit more clean of floating debris. Our overall stay was very enjoyable, but there a couple things I need to mention. First, who still charges $14.95 a day for wireless internet service? Are you kidding me! I had just come from 2 less expensive hotels in Arizona where it was free and worked well. I don\u2019t understand the logic of a 4 star resort having the rates they do and then still trying to squeeze out extra from their guests for internet service. Needless to say I didn\u2019t pay for it. Secondly, I was a bit unhappy with some off-duty lifeguards at Oasis who I overheard mentioning amongst themselves \u201cwe have to check the water levels\u201d and \u201cit works every time\u201d cutting to the front of the line of children, making their announcement, and then going down the slide head first in front of all of them, which is against the rules. As you can guess every child that witnessed this wanted to go down head first when their turn came, but were told they couldn\u2019t. My take on this is rules are rules for EVERYONE, and at no time should off-duty lifeguards be cutting in front of paying guests.

We had a wonderful time as a family but I can't give the hotel all the credit. The rooms were ok. Two room suites. TVs were old/small and there weren't a lot of frills. For us it was still ok. Small pools by each of the buildings was nice. The water park was a shock because of the crowds. Standing room only on Sunday. Felt like everything was dirty and crowded and not very relaxing. The next day was better. We got down to the water park at 9:00 am and there was a long line waiting to open at 9:30. However, we did get a nice spot and it made a big difference. Employee told me they have an average of 6000 people on a summer holiday. The food in the water park was WAY over priced and you can't bring anything in. Drinks almost $10- a corn dog was $6. I generally don't complain about the cost of hotel food but since it was a Stay-cation it bothered me more. The hotel has a well known restaurant at the top of the hill (hotel is at the bottom) called Rustler's Roost. I don't think I have ever had a good meal here but the atmosphere is amazing. Especially for you out of towners...you can see all of the valley and it is a spectacular view. The grandkids danced to the live band and went down the big slide. Kids ate free and our bill was cheaper than the pool grill. The cotton candy bouquet after dinner was all of our favorites. Entrees were just so-so. This is defintely an experience and not just a meal. Food was MUCH better at the mexican restaurant in front of the hotel \"Aunt Chiladas\".

The bedroom was HUGE with a comfy king bed and an entrance to the balcony that overlooked a rolling green golf course and a gorgeous waterfall! The bathroom was gigantic, with a large garden tub and a seperate all-glass shower that was the size of a large elevator! Very romantic :) This suite had a full size kitchen (full size fridge, oven/stove, microwave, etc..) and the dining and living area was very spacious as well. The couch folded out to a queen size bed, where the kids ended up sleeping. Flat screen TVs, beautiful decor and very very CLEAN. The Oasis Water Park was a BLAST! The kids ran around all day, playing in the wave pool, flying down the huge waterslides and floating down the lazy river. My husband and I enjoyed laying out in the sun with yummy frozen drinks and even floated around the lazy river ourselves. We ordered food while we were out there (nachos, wings, chicken sandwich) and it was top notch. I can't say enough great things about this resort. I am DEFINATELY going to plan another weekend getaway here! We even played at the water park all day on Sunday after check-out.

The primary reason for our trip to Arizona was the warm weather and sightseeing-not necessarily to use the facilities at the resort including the large water park. I chose it for the location of the resort; reasonable room rates and the reviews on TripAdvisor/Frommer's. We have previously travelled as a family to Iberostar and Beaches Resorts and to Atlantis among others. My wife and I have travelled to Sandals Resorts, Dreams Resorts, Sunscapes Resorts, etc. and I have reviewed most of these locations. This appears to be an older resort that has been extensively renovated. It is relatively large and does require some walking to the pools and restaurants. The buildings and grounds are well maintained and attractive. We rented a one bedroom suite that had a view of the mountains; golf course and ponds. The room had two queen beds in one room; a living room area with a pull out couch; one bathroom and a balcony for our family of five. The room was nicely appointed and had ample storage for our family. The balcony was a nice place to have a cup of coffee and read the paper in the morning. The carpeting and furnishing were upscale and appeared to be newer. The beds and bedding were very comfortable and the A/C was easy to use and effective. We were very pleased with the room and amenities considering the reasonable price we paid even when the $30/day resort fee was included. We had very few meals on site at the resort except one breakfast; morning coffee and two late night meals in the bar. We did not eat any of the many buffet meals that were offered. The service that we received in the bar and for breakfast was very good. It appears that most of the wait staff are college kids who were very friendly. The food and beverages were pricey but you are at a resort and the rooms were reasonably priced. The large gift shop area had a Starbucks that served coffee and snacks. However, the line was a little long in the morning. The water park would have great apeal for families with kids from age 5 to 15. We are a little past the top end of that range so we used the area mostly for laying in the sun. It was very crowded as it was Easter week during our visit. The water park is completely fenced in. Wrist bands are used for entry. The gates are opened to this area at either 9 AM or 10 AM based upon the day of the week. If you arrived around opening time you could go in; grab some towels and save chairs for your family. The fence around the water park and defined opening time may seem annoying to some one who hasn't travelled much but it is actually a good system. At least 9-10 AM is a reasonable time. At some resorts we have been at, you had to go out at 6 AM to reserve chairs or you were out of luck The water park was well laid out; had lots of chairs and pretty good food service. The water park included three slides; a lazy river and a few other pools. There was also some organized activities going on. You could actually have food and beverages served at your chair which is highly unusual for this type of set up. Again, the food and beverages in this area are pricey but were pretty good and the young college kids were the servers. We did not utilize the golf course or exercise areas during our trip. The resort is located about 10 minutes from the airport which was handy. Another, positive is that their is a large park with mountains adjacent to the property called South Mountain Park. The mountains are nice to look at and we did a little hiking in this area. However, the resort is located in a very urban area with busy roads; fast food joints and shopping areas...some which were not all that upscale. We stopped at a couple of these fast food places on our way out to an activity and they were a little scuzzy. Although you are in an urban area, you will not hear any road noises in the actual resort due to it's large size. There are lots of cool things to do with teenagers in the area (within an hour or two away) and include- 1) Horse Back Riding-Ponderosa Stables-we took the night time ride and dinner combo. This is very nearby the resort. Slow ride for beginners but a nice view of Phoenix after eating at a family type steakhouse. 2) Rafting down a river. Not exactly whitewater rafting but it was only 45 minutes away. Nice guides and nice scenery. Desert Voyages Guided Rafting. 3) ATVing in a national park. This was alot of fun. Again a very nice guide and beautiful scenery. Teenage boys will love this activity. Stellar Adventures. 4) Sedona. This area of red rocks is about two to two and a half hours north. Beautiful scenery especially if you take the drive (about 15 miles) north of Sedona up Oak Creek which has an elevation of 7,000 feet. We took the Pink Jeep Tour and did some hiking in the area. The town of Sedona is not very appealing. It is basically a collection of Tee Shirt shops. This area probably has some of the nicest scenery that I have ever seen and shouldn't be missed. 5) We also took a drive up to the Superstition Mountains and Apache Canyon Drive. This was a beautiful drive. I would highly recommend this resort and the excursions that we took. The rooms in the hotel are very comfortable; room price was reasonable; the staff was above average. Food prices were a little high (10-20%) but you aren't eating at McDonald's or Pizza Hut here. Also, the $30 resort fee is mandatory but not that big a deal when you consider the reasonable room rates.

The Service is very professional at all times and very good, from the bellman to the waitresses at the pool or the restaurants. The rooms are decent, the beds are new. The resort is close to the highway so getting in/out is easy. There is a nature preserve next to the hotel which has nice hiking. This was a real bonus cause it made it easy for my family and I to take our first ever hike together. On the negative side - these are not really suites. There's only one bathroom, and it is accessed via the master bedroom. Also, the sofa bed was very uncomfortable for sleeping, so my kids had to split the week and if you need three beds, then you need to have two queens in the master, so there goes the parent's privacy. There's no kitchennete. The resort is in a pretty seedy neighborhood. Skip Rustler's Roost. It's a tourist trap. Also, we went Spring Break and there was a line forming an hour before the water park opened at 10AM so people could get chairs. There were not enough chairs, and a lot of people were layingon towels in the grass. THis is probably not a problem except two weeks out of the year, but you should know this.

The food was good. The service was great. We had initially booked a suite and were offered an upgrade at check-in. We took advantage of this upgrade and entered our beautiful villa which had a beautiful kitchen (granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, etc)....we were disappointed to find that, even though there was a fully functioning kitchen, there was no cookware. We quickly learned that there was an extra $35.00 per week charge for these items (on top of the extra $30.00 per day that we were paying to have the kitchen in the first place). In addition, there wasn't enough time in the day to fill the beautiful tub with water for a warm soak....believe me, we tried. We had a couple of \"bumps in the road\" but nothing's perfect and overall it was a GREAT experience. We'd stay again.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, AL", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "PharmaTravelGirl", "ReviewID": "UR60772052", "Content": "I stayed here for a large business meeting and it was disappointing to say the least.

The rooms are ok, but the views of the parking lot and no balcony's with chairs make you want to spend very little time in or around your room. The resort was not a terrible experience by any means but there were just several things that we'd change. One of the main issues is that the Oasis Water Park is open to the public. Imagine spring break time, a resort full to capacity and then everyone and their neighbor coming for the day to the pool. The water park opens at 10:00 am, people start lining up outside the gate at 9:00. The line goes for a mile. If you are not in line you will not find one chair in the entire water park to sit in. It was so frustrating for us, and very sad to see the families wandering around and around and having to either leave or sit on the cement ground for the day because they couldn't find a chair. For the money you pay to stay at this resort you should at least expect a chair to sit on. This is also true for the pools that are seperate from the water park. There was never enough chairs for even half the people. As far as cleanliness, I never saw anyone ever clean any of the pool areas. The water park was never hosed down and the chairs and tables were filthy. the side pools by the rooms were always filthy with leftover cups and food on the ground. I wouldn't be suprised if people got sick. The restaurants were clean though. As for positives, the food was good, there were plenty of things for kids to do, and the resort was not too loud at night and disruptive. The king bed was very comfortable and the pillows. The lobby and the golf course are really pretty. I wouldn't go back, but that's mainly because of the water park issues and the cleanliness.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Cruces, NM", "Title": "\u201cHMMM...4 Star?

We spent over $425 a night for the hotel and over 100 a day in food so over $1600 for 3 nights. The hotel itself looks like a very old La Quinta with doors that open outside onto breezeways with no security anywhere. Anyone can drive or walk in and anyone can walk right up to your door, just like La Quinta. It looks like a group of converted apartment buildings. I paid extra to be near the water park with a view and was told I can only get a 2nd floor room so I was tricked into walking away from the check in with that information. Guess what? there is no first floor, they actually start ground floor numbering with #2. What a joke and insulting that I wouldnt notice I was on the ground floor where everyone comes and goes all day long right in front of the door to the room and the view was directly into a concrete enclosure.. We were tired and the rooms are about 200 yards from the check in area so we stayed in that room. The rooms were average at best in quality and looked like they tried to repaint and cover old furniture or something. Again we were told they were newly renevated. Ive stayed at nicer hotels for $80 a night. Now for the good news. The kids loved the water park but I resent the $30 a day fee and the extra $15 a day I had to pay for one of my kids to use the pool. You'd think for $425 a night they wouldn't want to nickle and dime you for $30 more dollars a day resort fee and 15 to use the pool. We spent all day at the pool area and had fun as they water park was the only reason we stayed there. My kids loved the movies they played on the big screen at the pool deck at night and the water park was a good 9 out of 10 for fun and quality except the hot tub was unsupervised and the kids were using it like a fun pool. Jumping in and out etc and adults could not enjoy it. It closed 2 times during our stay.

We asked to change rooms due to the smoke smell and the manager on duty was extremely rude. He said he was very proud of his hotel and indicated that he didn't appreciate our criticism of the first room. He did begrudgingly offer to upgrade us, though, and moved us to another room, one that was EXACTLY the same as the first. We travel for pleasure a great deal and I assure you this is NOT a 4 diamond resort. Most of the rooms have 2 foot deep balconies with no space for furniture. The views from the outside half of the rooms are of the parking lot. The views from the inside are ok, but not great. The rooms are ordinary at best and, although purportedly remodeled, there wasn't any difference between our first room in the \"old\" building and our second room in the \"new\" building.

The bed was very confortable. Great rooms. There are numerous pools on the complex to choose from. All are nice and include a hot tub. The food at the resort was overpriced and not that good. The choice of restaurant is very limited. There is on the property, but requiring a little walk, a Mexican restaurant (Aunt Chilida). That was nice, but it is only your average Mexican restaurant. The terrasse has firepits. So it is a nice place to hang around with a coffee or a glass of wine. Except for the rooms, the resort looks tired and in need of refurbishments. It offers very little activities. The staff was at most ok, but certainly not what is expected in such a resort. The concept of resort fee seemed like a good idea to good a few basic things like the tips to everyone. In this case, it is $42 per day. That's is way too much. Sure it covers parking (I didn't have a car), internet access (good), access to the water park (ok), tips for the room maid, but no other tips. You have to tip bell boys and other employees in surplus of your $42. So a good stay, but certainly not a great one. There are better options in the area for the same price.

The lobby is so clean and beautiful all staff was friendly and helpful the resturants were great the family breakfast buffet was a bit pricey but offered quit a bit of things but we ordered off the menu and the portions were huge so it was worth the money you paid the prices were not that bad. The suite we stayed in had a beautiful view of the golf course and the bedroom was huge with a french doored patio there were lots of bath towels in room and when their are 4 people it is nice to not have to call roomservice for more towels. The pull out couch area was also really big. Was a pull out couch, chair, coffee table, tv kitchen table with two big chairs a small sink in this area which also is nice when 4 people are brushing teeth, a small frig with key but we just bought our own waters at the grocery store less than 2 blocks away and took out their stuff put ours in to stay cold and just put theirs back in the frig so we weren't charged a little bit of pain but not enough to give bad rating. The only thing is there was no hairdryer or at least I didn't find one otherwise it was always clean and looked like everything was new and the beds were the most comfortable resort beds I have been in. The Golf course was beautiful and well kept and it was very challenging but not to bad that our 14 year old could golf good on it. We also got massages which were great just book tee times and spa services a couple days to a week in advance so you get the time and day you want it was well worth it. They had outdoor brick firepit areas with cushioned chairs to sit around it. Lots of beautiful fountains and flowers. Also the water park is included in your resort fee opens at 10:00 and be there at least 15-20 mins before if it is nice day to get best lay out spot I recommend over bridge on grass area was perfect for sun all day they also have covered area to lay out by and a 50-80 ft waterslide a huge hottub like fits 15-20 people, a lazy river, and little kid pool, they also serve drinks and food to you by just putting flag up on chair it was great they also show family movie at night there on a big screen. If you don't want to swim in waterpark there is a seperate lappool by spa area and another pool area by the mountain suites. They have a free bus to take you over to a huge mall if you want to do some shopping our kids are 14 and 18 and we all loved it there.

No one ever answered the guest service line in less than 2 minutes. Lines for check in and out were pretty long. Wait at Lobby Grill was always long despite only half of the tables being occupied (tells me they don't have enough staff) -The golf course. The first nine was palatable, the back nine a joke. Most players don't even need to bother with woods on the back, it's so short. Seems like they didn't have enough room for a regular 18, so they crammed the holes in. Even at the $49 twilight rate, it isn't worth playing again. I wanted to say it might be good for kids and the elderly, but I don't see how they would enjoy it much, given how impossibly tight some holes are. -Parking.

Which was a beautiful room, it was very comfortable and spacious. The beds were very nice and the pull out was fine for the kids. We asked housekeeping for extra towels and blankets and received them right away. The Oasis was the best. The servers were friendly and prompt with our orders. The pools were clean and super fun for all ages. They don't like you bringing in food or drinks, kinda a bummer, if you want your kids to eat healthier. The adult drinks were very yummy, but expensive. The Lobby Grill was a great place to get breakfast, pretty fast and tasty. Children's menu was basic enough, and kept the price down.

She was a little concerned about the negativity of the instructor - fyi. The gym was nice and had plenty of machines. We ate and Aunt Chiladas and then had dessert at the Rooste which has fantastic views. I would highly recommend this property for anyone - especially a family looking for a great vacation spot at a great value. I am booked to return in May with my husband and two daughters to enjoy the water park! One last fyi - the pull out beds in the rooms are VERY uncomfortable and are not suited for adults.

It's a beautiful State and it is Disney free! We stayed 9 nights in the Arizona Grand and 5 nights in a Scottsdale Villa with friends. This is a very family orientated hotel so our 8 year old daughter loved the company of others her age in the excellent pool facilities (v. important to an 8 year old and mum!). The main pool area had two sections which were connected by a swim-through. One area had a wave pool and fake beach which was great for the little kids - and the second areas had a pool volleyball and pool basket ball which were great for the slightly older kids (like my 8 year old and me). All surrounded by the lazy river and the Waterslides which looked really scary! In addition, each block of villas had their own pool and ping pong table which were good for a quick dip in the late afternoon/evening if out for the day (these pools are open 'till 11:00 p.m). Concerns from other reviews about long walks to get anywhere were unfounded. We stayed in a Deluxe room near the Water Park and once you explore all the short cuts, the main areas are no more than a few minutes pleasant walk away. Rustler's Roost was a golf buggy away but that was really no problem. The room was fine - the seperate living room and the resort wide wireless internet access were very useful. No hidden charges beyond the resort fee. The resort fee wasn't a prolem as we knew about it at time of booking and could therefore factor it into the budget. We went out on the horses after breakfast 4 days in a row and it was special. Great fun and the Wranglers were hilarious. The same area can be easily accessed for walking. There are a network of trails which can be easily reached for a long hike or just a short walk which was great. A short drive into Scottsdale for other fun (we went to a baseball game, MaCdonalds Ranch riding, Crackerjacks play park). The food on the resort is very poor and we would avoid the room service as it is offensively expensive and rubbish. We used the fridge for storing our own stuff (we made rolls etc a few times and they were tastier and a lot cheaper). Overall the service was really excellent and very friendly. The Phantom Horse has very friendly & helpful waitresses and waiters but again the food was very basic. The poolside service was very slow but it was U.S. Easter Break and they couldn't keep up with the demands. That said, a teenager fainted whilst queing in the heat for food and the medics were with here within minutes and she was fine shortly after that. The water park opens at 10 a.m. and had a long queue from 9:20 a.m. and a race to the seats which is not good for a relaxing holiday experience hence the 3 stars rating in this review.

There were 3 waterslides, a lazy river, a wave pool as well as a 25 person hot tub and another pool area with volleyball/basketball, plus a baby pool. Our waitress by the pool area was super friendly and the food was good. My only complaint was with the people who cleaned our room. It was not done well and the shampoo/conditioner was not replaced, but that is probably more a problem with an individual, rather than the resort.

My parents meet us there and stayed a few rooms down. Overall I thought the resort was very nice and we all enjoyed ourselves. I probably don't have much new to add but will provide my two cents. The resort is big and spread out but I didn't consider it a big deal. The weather is great and I personally enjoyed walking around and what's wrong with a little exercise. The resort is right in the middle of town but I never noticed it while in the resort and when we ventered out is was nice to be close to things. The resturant situation on the resort is very limited. We had a car so we didn't eat at the resort for any meals. If you didn't have a car and had to eat here every meal I could see that being an issue. The waterpark was great. We would spend most of the day there then go back to the quite pool by our room. This is definetly a great place for kids. My dad an I played golf at the resort twice and finished in 3 1/2 hours both times. We found the course to be challenging with great views. A hint on this. You can book your tee times online at one of the discount golf sites for half what they will charge you if you book through the pro shop. I think it was like $100 a round through the pro shop and we paid $59. Construction was going on right outside our room which was pretty annoying but it looked to be about done so it shouldn't be an issue much longer. They waived our $30 facility fee due to being woken up early each morning. The resort was pretty empty so I'm not sure why they didn't just put us somewhere else. Anyway, it wasn't that big a deal. The new Villas looked really nice and when we go back we will probably look to book one of those. The access to South Mountain park was very cool and we went hiking each morning. One other suggestion. You can rent a car from Enteprise (I think it may have been National) at the resort and its much cheaper this way as you don't pay all the airport fees. They will bring it to you and you drop it off there so you never have to leave the resort to get it.

I was familiar with the property when it was the Pointe at South Mountain, although my memory was very dated and vague (15+ years). We tried to get our pre-paid money back but were unsuccessful. My husband spoke with the Manager, several times, who assured us he would look out for us. When we arrived we were cheerfully greeted by everyone- the bell hops/car valets, the front desk and the Manager on Duty. We were given a room that was in the recently completed Villas. It was marvelous (and my standards are high). Brand new, spacious, beautiful kitchen, HUGE bathroom, lovely bedroom, patio overlooking the water park, and living area with sleeping couch for my son. Everything was in mint condition. Even new flat screen TVs. The water park is marvelous and our 11 year old son was happy to be there most of the day. Adults can get aways from the craziness at the water park (I mean, people running for pool chairs? Come on!) by hanging out at the Spa pool and I saw another Adults Only pool in a seperate location. The location right next to South Mountain park made me happy because I was able to get my morning hikes in on a very different terrain. The Gym/Spa were large and had plenty of equipment. Only ate breakfast on property twice - both times the food was only adequate. Otherwise we did not eat on property. The golf seemed OK - the golf staff was marvelous. There were no tennis courts which was disappointing because the website listed 10 tennis courts. I had a massage which was done quite well and reasonably priced. I agree with other reviewers that the property is large - if you are staying away from the water park entrance or the Phantom Horse Grill and Gym/Spa area then you do have a walk. We were conveniently and centrally located in front of the park and beside the gym. In terms of managing expectations - the overall property location is lousy (except for aforementioned South Mountain Park). It is right on the I-10 highway, and in the middle of strip mall heaven. Its about a 20+ minute drive to Scottsdale. On the upside, it's 2 miles from Tempe Diablo Stadium, and we did have Angels Spring Training tix!. Also, there is not much \"plush\" or luxurious about the property. The spa is adequate but not luxurious. What little spa amenities there are, are cheesy (e.g., generic brand baby powder, no shower gel in the showers, no lotion....). The food we had was sub-average, the landscaping is so-so, and the overall ambience is very \"mall-like\". But, again, we had a great room at a good value. Having the kitchen helped a lot with saving money on breakfast and snacks. There was construction still going on. It looked like they were putting the finishing touches on the new lobby/restaurant/golf club. It should be very nice when completed. It looked close to being done when we were there in late March 2009. Finally, the staff was very cheerful and friendly. Every last one of the people I interacted with was helpful and seemed to be pleased to be serving the Guests. I even saw the maid inside the shower stall spraying it to make sure it was totally clean.

I've used Trip Advisor in the past and want to give back so I hope you find this review helpful. This course is pretty tough - bring a lot of balls if you're anything more than a 20 handicap. The greens were ridiculously slow and really took away from our enjoyment of the course. I paid $200 for my 13 year old and myself which is steep. The course offers good variety and blends between links and desert style. It's also very close to the freeway on a few holes which is a bit distracting and noisy. We started our round and did not see a single beverage cart until the 17th hole which was a real bummer. Go figure! Prices are standard for Resorts where you are pretty captive. You really need a car to get to anything off resort unless you want to dare the 6 lane higways and massive intersections to get to 'Claim Jumper' or 'Joes Crab Shack' down Baseline. The service was very spotty. Most servers were fairly content just doing what they were told and nothing more. The rooms were very clean and spacious with balconies. One drawback for us was proximity to construction of the new lobby which is 'supposed' to be complete on 4/9/2009. We never tried to change rooms because it wasn't really a distraction except when going to the main lobby through some of the construction area which was a bit of a hassle and not something you want to endure on vacation at a resort. The construction workers were exceptionally cordial as you passed by which made the inconvenience less unpleasant. The gym was outstanding - probably the best part was the many classes offered throughout the day. There's also a great lap pool at the gym. Each complex also has its own pool and jacuzzi which gives you the chance to really get away if you want some quiet. The Oasis Water Park was great and offers all sorts of activities from the lazy river to basketball/volleyball to dive in movies during the evening. 'The biggest drawback here was the service (it was just about impossible to get anyone to help us and worked best to just get it yourself) and most of the 'lifeguards' who are predominantly Asian transplants and exceptionally subdued. At one point, I went down one of the waterslides and lost my magnetic bracelet (a personal item). I asked the lifeguard if he saw a bracelet come down - he said 'there's nothing check the front desk'. It was bizarre to say the least. When I tried to engage him, it was clear he had little grasp of english and even less interest in helping me so I gave up. The lifeguards appear to be on duty to police the activity in the lazy river making sure everyone has an inner tube as required by lazy river law. This seemed to be their mission and they were quite dour with a few exceptions. Blech! I would say the service at the Oasis water park was the worst part of the trip but the water park itself was exceptional! We stayed 4 nights. Per night we paid $239 + $30 taxes + $30 'Resort Fee' which is for the wi-fi cloud hanging over the resort (very very slow and sometimes hard to use), the USA Today paper, the water park and minor amenities.

The buildings are laid out nicely around courtyards and each area has its own smaller pool & hot tub in addition to the water park (we stayed in the \"Camelback\" rooms which are right by the water park, which makes it easy if you have small children). OUR ROOM: The room was very nicely decorated (they have graciously resisted the ubiquitous turquoise & mauve \"desert southwest/pueblo\" decor in favor of soft beiges, golds & whites). All the furnishings, finishes & fixtures (paint, wallpaper, carpet, plumbing, etc.) looked new and fresh and updated. The bed was very comfortable and the towels were nice and thick. There was a nice patio on the back with french doors where my son could run around and play. The soundproofing seems good, we did not ever hear our neighbors. You park fairly close to your room which is convenient. All rooms open to the outside, but don't let that make you think it is not a nice place, it is. WATER PARK: Good-sized with a large wade-in wave pool, volleyball/basketball pool, kiddie pool with fountain play area, very large hot tub, lazy river and 3 water slides. STAFF: In every encounter we had w/staff , they were friendly and helpful, from the bellhops to the concierge to the wait staff and housekeeping. FOOD: A little overpriced, but that is expected at a resort property. The water park food I would say was \"OK\", as was Aunt Chilada's (but I live in Dallas where there is an abundance of outstanding tex-mex). The Phantom Horse Grill was excellent every time with a very nice atmosphere inside and out, including a nice roomy deck with torches & firepits. Rustler's Rooste had probably the best steak we've ever had and fabulous sunset views of the mountains surrounding Phoenix. There is a small coffee bar in the lobby which has muffins, cold cereal, and sometimes salads & sandwiches for lunch, but it is only open until 1:00 p.m. They should expand this into a more full-service cafe to provide families with a better option for quick take-away food vs. a sit-down restaurant and also a place to get hot chocolate or maybe an ice cream in the evenings. The resort is right in the City of Phoenix, so it is possible to go off-property for food fairly easily if you have a car. FOR FAMILIES: I think it's a good resort for families, even w/very young children. It would be nice if there were some kind of playground onsite, however there is a nice city park w/playground a couple of miles down the road, but we were not told about it when we called to ask if the resort had a playground. In lieu of a playground, there is lots of space on the grounds for leisurely strolls with toddlers. They do have a nanny/babysitting service for a fee, but we did not try it.

I terms of in-suite amenities it seemed to be lacking to me, for example, no shower gel, no bathrobes, cotton wool or shower cap, all things one would expect from a 4-star hotel, or even from a run-of-the-mill B&B. For a single traveller or a couple it is really not necessary to have a suite, though I can see the appeal if you have kids. All this serves to do is make all the rooms very expensive for the sake of a sofa, coffee table and extra TV that I didn't use at all. I am British, and I found the service levels a bit OTT. I do not require a golf cart to transport me to the bar, when it is all of a 3 minute walk away. I resent being forced to use a high-end sedan car rather than a regular cab, and then pay through the nose for it because the bellman takes a cut of the fare.

I know the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar is not favourable right now, but even when it was, I would say this place is on the pricey side and I can only assume this is because it is a resort and people tend to stay put so they have a captive market.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and hospitable hellos from the front desk staff as well as the bellmen. We were always asked if we needed assistance wherever we went, which is a nice change from some larger chain hotel companies that we have stayed at-this felt like a friends home that we were visiting-we didn't get lost in the shuffle. Our room was clean and as the hotel just went through a rennovation, we were very pleased with our accomodations. Since this is an all suite resort, each room has a living room and a separate master bedroom- a great layout. We had a great nights sleep. We had time to visit the fitness center and was amazed that such a large fitness center was at a hotel-this is not your normal \"after thought\" of a fitness center-it could be your local gym, but of course, much more upgraded. We didn't have time to visit the spa, although while we were relaxing in the spa, we did chat with two other guests who had a treatment that day and had rave reviews. The restaurants on property were exceptional and again, the service was warm and friendly the entire time. We used the check out service through the guest services menu in the morning, which was nice as it allowed us to be on the road and to the airport in no time... and the airport is only 5 minutes away, so very convenient to get there quickly.

What a surprise to find a beautiful well maintianed resort with a professional and very accomodating staff. We arrived before check in time, with no problem they gave us our room. A valet drove us to our room and helped us with our bags. We then went to the Oasis Water Park which was a fantstic attraction for both my 3 year old and my 11 month old. We spent both Saturday and Sunday at the waterpark. The lazy river was the hi-light for both children. With Seasonal hours the Oasis was closed the rest of the week so my husband golfed the resorts' course on Monday. He is a pretty avid golfer, golfing at least 3 times a month, and he was pleasantly surprised with this challenging course. It had recently been reseeded so the entire course was flawless. Very impressive course! We were at the resort during their off season, so there were very little crowds anywhere we ventured in the resort. The restaurants were great as well. The Rustlers Roost was a hit with my 3 year old since it is decked out with cowboys, a live bull in the front of the restaurant, and a tin slide in which you can enter the dining area. The Rainforest Cafe is down the street from the Resort, and the Resorts Aunt Chiladas Mexican restaurant had wonderful service and great Mexican food. The workout facility was well equiped and readily available to work out in most parts of the day. We did not have a chance to use the spa facilities.

This is one of those megaresorts that has everything: wave pool, water slides, lazy river, movie by pool side at night, etc. They also offer kids tattoos, animal balloons, and caricature drawings during the day. This resort is ideal for families who want activity, over service. Service was lacking for us. For example, the balloonist at the pool was extremely unfriendly and decided to cut the line in front of my daughter, twenty minutes before the time he said they were closed! This happened to us two days in a row. Hmmm... The bell desk also kept giving away our transportation to someone else, despite the fact that we called each time and made reservations for specific pick up times. The guests who were given our rides told us that they did not. One time, we had to wait 20 minutes for the next car and almost missed our reservations. For the price, this resort was a good deal (our toddler loved it) but I guess for those who want better service, smaller boutique-styled resorts that are more service-oriented are the way to go. If you do give this resort a try, stay in the Camelot or Sedona buildings since they are closest to the water park. Camelot is closer to the spa and Phantom Horse Grill (best restaurant on site, IMO, with a view of the city). Each building has its own adult-only pool and family pool. This was especially nice during those times when the water park was so packed, we couldn\u2019t find any empty chairs. The food at the Phantom Horse Grill was better than the other restaurants we tried -- nice way to end the evening by enjoying a meal by the firepit with city views. We also tried Aunt Chilada\u2019s, which was pretty good, especially the tacos and chips/salsa. The food at the pool side Oasis was horrible (philly steak sandwich, hotdogs with dried out hard buns, and wings), but I didn\u2019t expect much since it was convenient and quick. Ruslter\u2019s Roose offers cowboy-style fare, like fried chicken, ribs, steaks, etc. The food was pretty good there and the dining experience great for families (indoor slide and balloonist, who was extremely friendly and attentive, who made balloons for the kids while you ate). We also ordered room service for breakfast. It was average and really pricey but service was quick. I just wish they offered more options for breakfast at this resort. Also, the resort offers horseback riding if your children are 6 yrs old and up. If not, you can take an 8 mile drive to the Ponderosa Stable where they allow toddlers to ride with parents -- which is what we did.

They were very comfortable, clean and spacious two room suites. The water park is the biggest draw and it was fun for the afternoon. Lots of kids. Overall it was a great way to unwind though. They even had steel drum music before lunch which I love. Reminds me of the Carribbean. The restaurants were varied. Breakfast was just your standard. Chips and salsa were great at the Mexican place and I was actually suprised at how tasty my steak was at the steakhouse. I figured it would be on par with Outback or something because of the whole cowboy theme but was pleasantly suprised. It is a big place so there is some walking involved but you could always call the front desk for a ride. Great gym and spa facilities. And we really enjoyed the horseback riding. Overall the staff was very friendly and helpful.

You are definitely just another tourist in this place and there is very little feeling that you are in a resort. We picked this one because we heard they had a great water park, but I have no desire to return. The water park just isn't that great. On top of that, this is one of those places where you think you are getting a great deal until you actually get here and find out they nickel and dime you for everything and it is all 3 times as expensive as it ought to be. Drinks at the pool are $8. I got the bill today and found I have a $25 \"resort fee\" which I never knew I would be paying. This on top of the $20 \"upgrade\" they convinced us we must have when we checked in. This was so we could have the new furnishings and wireless. Apparently we would have been in a real dump without the upgrade, next to the freeway and FAR from the water park with old furnishings and no internet. Add to this the fact that the whole place is under construction and you wake up to jack hammers every morning. The staff act as if you are in their way. I shared a guest, not service, elevator with a cart full of what smelled like rotting brocolli yesterday morning at 7:30am. That killed my breakfast appetite.

My 15 year old had a blast here. Once he saw the water park I didn't hardly see him for the rest of the stay. I stayed in the newly remodeled Camelback Suites. I have stayed in 4* hotels before and whereas this suite was nice, there were parts to it that I didn't find 4*. First of all why a newly remodeled suite would have a 25\" outdated tube tv is beyond me. The couch was a bit uncomfortable to watch tv in the evenings. It was ok to sit there for an hour but anything beyond an hour was uncomfortable. The other thing was the size of the bathroom. It is tiny. My powder room at home is probably bigger than this bathroom. I had read about people complaining about the noise. Actually once in our suite, we didn't hear a thing. Our suite was so convenient to the water park we couldn't have had a better location. The hotel staff were very friendly and responsive to our needs. The best part of the whole stay and definitely worth the stay was the water park. Being able to relax poolside with a few drinks and know your kid is having a blast made this weekend getaway great. We will definitely be going back despite the negative things I listed. The things listed didn't make me not want to be there or make me not go back.

The room was very clean and had all the items you would want. The actual mattress...extremely comfortable!!! Aunt Chilada's Mexican Restaurant....Muy Bueno! Everything we had there was great and our waiter, Thomas, was fantastic. The Oasis Water Park is clean, well staffed and a fun way to spend the day. There are flags on the back of the lounge chairs that when you want something to drink or eat...you just raise the flag and they'll come running. They were very quick to arrive and very polite. Bring some $$$ though, It can get pricey quick. Think movie concession prices. Caring and helpful staff. I had several complaints, and they addressed them the best they could and were always professional and sympathetic. Now the bad...(in my opinion) There are a lot of kids at this resort. A lot. Noise is a HUGE factor. This may sound weird...but they have the worlds most crunchiest sheets I've ever felt. It was like sleeping under a newspaper. Thank goodness, the bed itself was so comfortable. the pillows are down and they look so nice and fluffy on the bed, but after a minute, its like wearing feather ear-muffs, with the feathers disbursed to each side of your head and your neck on a pancake thin layer of feathers. If you can...bring your pillow from home. The Phantom Horse breakfast buffet...runny eggs and barely cooked sausage...however, in fairness, you can order alacart off the menu and the people who I saw did that, their food looked pretty good. The restuarant has nice atmosphere and great views. The patio would be a great place to eat at sunset. Did i mention how many kids there are at his resort? How they like to run up and down the corridors? Oh, i did? Ok...sorry. Needless to say, my initial stay at the resort was anything but peaceful and restful. It would be nice if the resort had at least one of their buildings designated as \"adults only\" for those who are looking for a more relaxed atmosphere. I contacted the General Manager, Paul Gray after my stay to discuss my disappointing weekend at the Grand. He not only listened to my concerns and disappointments. He was very quick to offer a solution and sincerely sounded like he wanted to make right anything that didn't go right the first time. I think that type of personal customer service is rare and because of his follow-up, I'd even give the Grand another chance to impress. Anyone who cares enough to follow-up and try to make things better, is probably someone who cares that you were there in the first place! So, my first stay...not so good, but I'm encouraged, the next time will be better. I'll keep you posted. :O) KW", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Valley Cottage, NY", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "Member008", "ReviewID": "UR15476946", "Content": "I'm sorry the last reviewer had a horrible time, but my experience was the complete opposite. We picked the A.G.R. because of the great price ($159 a night) and the waterpark. My husband and I wanted someplace that would keep our 6 year old busy. The waterpark was very clean, the staff extremely friendly and the food & drink were reasonably priced. My only complaint about the waterpark is the waterslides were only for people 48\" and taller. While my daughter is a good swimmer, she wasn't tall enough to use the slide and was upset about that. It would've been nice if they had a slide that catered to the smaller children and maybe a playground on the grounds. We stayed in the Camelback building and the suite was completely renovated. There were two heated pools in the courtyard of the Camelback along with a ping pong table. My only complaint about the room is the bathroom was very, very small. It was difficult to close the door unless you were practically standing in the tub and I'm average sized. I can only imagine what a large person has to do. The grounds were beautiful and well tended with flowers, trees, fireplaces and fountains. My daughter and I went to the spa where I had a massage and she had the Pretty Princess package; manicure, pedicure and hairstyling. The staff was professional, courteous and made us feel very comfortable. We had dinner at Rustler's Roost and Aunt Chilada's. Both were good, not spectacular but I didn't expect either of them to be a Michelin rated. I would highly recommend this extremely family friendly resort to just about everyone. However, if you choose this hotel, ask for either the Camelback or Sedona buildings because the Mountainview building isn't going to start being renovated until August.", "Date": "April 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cKid friendly, overpriced\u201d", "Author": "jcjohns91107", "ReviewID": "UR14638576", "Content": "We took a spring break mini-vacation in late March, 2008.

Bathroom is a little small. We were in the Sedona Building, room 433. Had a view of an interior courtyard even though I requested a pool view. Room was in good condition, but maid service was sketchy. The maid finally showed uo the second day at almost 5pm, so we opted for clean towels only as we had just come back from the pool and wanted to get cleaned up. For some reason the hotel doesn't supply \"do not disturb\" signs for the doors. There is construction going on at the property to add buildings. It didn't really bother us. Most room had balconies which are basically un-usable because there is no furniture on them and they are small. Over all, the resort was ok.
