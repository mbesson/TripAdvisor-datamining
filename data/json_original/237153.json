The rooms are basically a cot bed a dresser with 4 hangers and a light switch. You get a private bathroom which emits a sewer like smell that will require you to keep the bathroom door closed at all times. The walls are paper thin so you get what I like to call a 360 degree conversational / experience from your close neighbors with a couple having sex at 3am as a side bonus. I appreciated that after being on an international flight for 17 hours without sleep. Bring not only your own shampoo but also soap as the hotel provdes none. There is one iron that is shared among the 40+ rooms but I have yet to get my fair share out of it. Maybe if I come back a week from Wednesday I'll get my turn. Until then I'm walking around in wrinkled shirts. They have WiFi but it's only in the lobby and they provide a hard bench to sit on. Finally bring lots of cash as the hotel does not accept credit cards. I will say that the hotel staff does seem friendly and overall cleanliness is acceptable. Yes it's close to the Rambla but so are alot of other hotels that are much nicer for probably 20 more Euros a night. For college students and just people traveling on minimal budget...hit up a hostel and get a private bed with shared bathroom. For business travellers if your company puts you up here you have to question whether your boss really likes you and might want to spruce up the old resume.

The owners were friendly and kept things in the hotel safe for us. It is a good budget hotel for a short sightseeing break but I would not like to have it as a main holiday or for more than 5/6 days. A minus for us was that we had booked a twin room (for two girlfriends) and despite confirming this again by fax only got a small double bed which they couldnt change until the last night and then we couldnt be bothered to change. Just a word of warning: please be so careful with your bags, my friend's rucksack was tampered with on an escalator but nothing stolen at the Barcelonabus station which was full of unsavory types and the bus driver had to chase some off when we arrived. Do all the usual safety checks - there are now lots of police about all over the city (but not at this bus station at night) and everyone tells you to watch your bags. There is even a notice on the breakfast table telling you not to leave your bag - it does make even a seasoned traveller a little alarmed! Rucksacks are such an easy target especially those with easy opening zips at the front and do look so touristy.", "Date": "October 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales UK", "Title": "\u201cdont trust the staff here!\u201d", "Author": "traveller123159", "ReviewID": "UR3693077", "Content": "Although most of the reviews of this hotel tell a fairly accurate picture- central, basic. attractive building, noisy and so on, we met an unexpected problem when we brought a group of 26 students.

Basically the hotel had delibearatley overbooked and told us barefaced lies to cover up, knowing there was nothing we could do about it. We had Spanish speakers with us but could do nothing- it was a take it or leave it attitude, and the same thing happened when some of our female staff were intimidated by german students in the room next door over the following days. We got around the problem of rooms by moving beds and putting some students in another hotel, which was paid for eventually by Studylink, but it made an unpleasant start to the visit.

We didn't get much noise from the outside, but the thin walls and doors left us at the mercy of neighbors, and the couple across the hall were pretty loud, especially slamming doors in the morning.

This hotel is only a few steps off Las Ramblas, and it wasn't a horrible walk to Montjuic, either. Easy access to a couple of subway stops, and while the area to the west can be shady, this generally is a safe location. Try El Pollo Rico across the street for lunch. Good price, good food.

But it was too late to change it so I went along anyway, and ended up being pleasantly surprised. There was no sign of any bedbugs (we checked matresses and sheets, and we have no bites a week on). Both the room and shared washroom facilities were clean. The staff were friendly, and breakfast was perfectly adequate (bread, a muffin and tea/coffee/oj). The air conditioning worked a treat so we had a lovely cool nights sleep, and noise was never a problem, though we did invest in some earplugs after reading advice on this site. I think this is something worth doing no matter where you plan to stay, as the movements of the other guests are pretty much beyond a hotel's control! There was not much natural light in our room as the window faced into the building, but this also meant that there was no external noise from the street - a big plus in noisey Barcelona! The furniture was worn out (e.g. drawers wouldn't open fully, bedside table was on a slant etc.), but the beds were comfy. The large plant-draped foyer area is lovely to come back to. The hotel definately has character and we felt comfortble and totally at home there. The atmosphere is relaxed, and this makes it an oasis amongst the bustling busy streets.
