The room was as small as was possible for a double room; wardrobe was a four-hanger rail behind a fixed door; and the bathroom was so small the door to the loo was the same one as the separate shower area, which was very difficult to control the temperature of. You couldn\u2019t pass one another in the room one had to move to let the other pass. There was no fridge, no tea/ coffee making facilities, no tissues, and no iron or ironing board available from reception. The three lifts were in constant use so there was always a lengthy wait, and when you got the ground floor eating area it resembled a motorway service station.

Seasoned travellers would spot that some of the staff wore a Ramada badge and when questioned you found that you could use all the facilities of the Ramada next door, including the restaurant and breakfast bar. You had to pay up front for the facilities but it was well worth it. Here the food was excellent and the service polite and helpful, but it was not advertised or mentioned. Considering the hotel only opened in March 2011 it was showing signs of wear already. If I was youth hostelling then it would have been an adequate hotel, and suitable for young school parties but not for more senior travellers.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cgood location, new and clean\u201d", "Author": "Travelmania79", "ReviewID": "UR112526034", "Content": "We spent two nights at this hotel.

IKEA style furnishings. We were given two beds pushed together rather than one large one as requested. It was my partners birthday & comfort would have been appreciated. The hotel seems to accommodate an inordinate amount of school parties. Not a comfortable scene for proper grown up people. Especially as they are permitted to play in the revolving doors. Reception staff are dismissive or quite frankly rude. The notable exception was the charming blond girl working in the cafeteria(yes cafeteria, no bar or restaurant). Sorry I didn't get her name. Only real positive was the power shower. It would seem to be part of the Ramada group, prices are too high for basically an upmarket hostel.", "Date": "March 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cNew nice and cozy hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ann25v", "ReviewID": "UR100172430", "Content": "A nice new hotel with good location: close proximity to the city center and U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations.

But few things which I think are complete had some issues. Poistives: 1)Location:Its at the hear of Alexzanderplatz , well connected to all the tourist place. You can walk to many attraction or take Bus 100 from there. 2) Price:Is affordable and reasonable 3) Staff: Freindly , helpful and speak English 4) Cleanliness: As expected from a standard good hotel.So Satisfied Negatives: 1)Bed: The pillows are two thin/soft. As I was there for only one night we dint bother to ask for another pair , we just folded them. But it needs to improve. 2)TV: They have this round and stylish Cupboard/coat hanger, which looks good but blocks the view from one side. 3)Floor: Its not smooth,you can feel the roughness nd see cracks on the wooden floor. 4) Bathroom:The Glass door of the Shower cubicle had gap so as you take a shower , the floor outside the cubicle will aslo het wet. 5) Breakfast: It was mostly cold breakfast, so we dint feel its value for money (\u20ac8 pp). We just walked to the McDonalds cafe nearby. But again as the Hotel is yet to be completed (we arrived 3days after opening) I hope things will improve.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "H2 Hotel Berlin Alexanderplatz", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1935574-Reviews-H2_Hotel_Berlin_Alexanderplatz-Berlin.html", "Price": "$91 - $198*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse 32</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10178</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1935574", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/27/c5/6e/h2-hotel-berlin-alexanderplatz.jpg"}}
