Venice is known to be notoriously expensive so I researched hotels through recommendations from friends. One friend recommended this hotel so I booked. I booked only a week in advance so we had to get the rate that included breakfast so paid 20 euros more than I had previously seen on their website so I recommend you book early to get the best rates. Definitely book the room without breakfast as you are better off paying 5 euros each for a crossiant and cafe at a bar nearby. This hotel is perfectly located only 300 meters from San Marco square. Makes it easy to tour around and if you need a break or shower, it is easy to get back. The staff was very welcoming when we arrived and always courteous throughout our stay. Even though we arrived at 1 p.m., our room was already ready and they immediately showed us to our room (and even carried our luggage!). The room was simple but clean. The shower had good water pressure and was hot. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was the breakfast is not the best--canned fruit, packaged crackers and coffee from a generic coffee machine (not espresso from a real espresso machine that is so good in Italy). They did have some fresh bread and crossiants and nutella so that saved the day:) Also the pillows are hard as rocks...we would have requested new ones but it was too late and so we just used the ones supplied. The hotel also offered us a free water taxi ride to Murano island...it was a wonderful treat but beware as they must have a deal with the glass factory there because there is big pressure to buy there...it is not just an informative tour. I recommend taking the public boat for 6.50 and touring around Murano yourself. It will be much more enjoyable and cheaper (the factory is NOT cheaper than the stores on Murano). Overall, a wonderful hotel and I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "iceland", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is a wonderful gem\u201d", "Author": "lisa026", "ReviewID": "UR125256178", "Content": "I honestly dont know why this hotel does not get a better rating, should be very much higher up on the tripadvisor rating. I have written reviews before on this as it is MY hotel for whenever I am in Venice but since I just returned I wanted to write one more. First off, as confusing as Venice is, so very easy to get lost there, this hotel is pretty easy to find. Go to San Marcos, with the church on your right, go under the clock tower, first right, second left ( there is a shoe store where you need to turn) and straight ahead for a minute or so. Plenty of little cafes and shops around this charming little square.The hotel itself is small but totally wonderful. The rooms I have stayed in so far, and guessing they are all like that, have the true Venician decor, very charming and I would hate it would it be all modern in a city like this. The beds are too comfy, I sleep wayyyyyyyyy too long there, and having the breakfast delivered to your room is so nice. You can also go down for it in a room just off the lobby but I got all I needed, tea, coffee, bread, cerials, fruit and more. Set me up for the day. I also love the bonus of the free wii fii, my pet peeve are hotels that charge for this and there are a lot of them in Italy but this is a bonus and worked 100% of the time. An issue I would like to adress is I see a lot of people that comment here are less then happy with the staff at the hotel. I will tell you that from my experience, they have always, always, been more then helpful and very kind. In fact, I doubt I would still be going to Venice if not for this staff, in fact many of them are now actually friends. Please check into this hotel with an open mind about them and I hope you find them as friendly as I do. There is also a supermarket close by, not very common in the city, just leave the hotel to the left, over the brigde, first left after then and you are there in a sec. And since the hotel does not have that stupid USA tradition of whatever you take out of the frigde, you will be charged for, you can restock at your will. Came in handy for me since I was buying chesse and such that needed to be stored. Only thing I can say about the hotel that I did not care for, were the bells. There is a church right next door, and the bells go off at 10 AM. And last for a good few minutes. This will not matter to most people but since I have was having a very good sleep in that lovely bed, it could get a little annoying while charming. But San Zulian will always be the hotel for me while in the city and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you SZ and a special thank you to Daniele, a front desk member who really goes out of his way to make the stay enjoyable.

I checked their pictures before I started writing the review and they certainly don't show my room. They should be required to date their pictures. The dining area shown appears to be a room when in fact it is a small hall/alcove off the elevator. It is obviously an after-thought and too small to accommodate the hotel.

My room was on the 3rd floor and when the elevator arrived at the 3rd floor there was a flight of stairs to my room. Surprise! There was one miniscule window over-looking roofs which blocked any hope of natural light. The paint was flaking from the walls in the bathroom and the material covered headboard was worn and stained. The bathroom had a strange low alcove off the shower area with a light.

One of the main problems in the hotel is the very small area allocated for breakfast. This create a bit of chaos every morning. There was not a single morning we had to wait until a table is set for breakfast (although the waiting time was around 10 minutes). But can be difficult with kids to wait for breakfast! The staff was nice and pleasant. The staff at the check in counter was rather formal (except the younger guy we saw one day). As other reviewers have indicated, yes, they do arrange free trip to a Murano Glass Factory, which was an amazing experience. We were taken by a free water taxi, which took about 15 minutes to get there and return trip by normal boat took about 45 minutes. One small thing about the hotel: There was a LCD TV in the room, which never worked. I reported day after day, but nothing was done. Once they told me that it would fixed next day, but was not done. Now we all know we do not go to Venice to watch TV.

Don't believe all the crap from the one recent review. Those people sound like demanding and inflexible curmudgeons that no one could ever satisfy! This is a polite and very comfortable boutique hotel. The trip to Murano is worth it just to get a great ride in one of those beautiful water taxis. Beware....it's right to the dock of a very big and expensive glass factory. After the glass blowing demonstration, it's ....\"Now, may I take you to our showroom\". The sales pitch is almost laughably intense. Don't look too interested in anything and get out of there as soon as you can. Other shops in Murano are much more intimate and have way more affordable things, (though no one was buying anything as the Euro was dropping like a stone). This is not an excursion paid for by the hotel, it's merely a service provided to many hotels to get the tourist into this particular showroom. In fact, the staff at the San Zulian seemed kind of reluctant to have their guests subjected to this freebee. I can understand why. Oh, also.....you're on your own to get back but that's easy on the vapparetto. Go to the Faro stop and buy a ticket in the little tobacco store.

I found italy to be a beautiful place with warm friendly people, lovely places and some amazing sites with good hotels. I have travelled extensively all around the world and have faced some really good and some really terrible places, but this hotel takes the cake for rude behaviour, inhuman treatment to guests (or should i say inmates in a concentration camp or jail cells) and 'service\" which would, probably any other normal hotel, would prefer to shut down than subject its guests to such behaviour. had booked for 2 nights, for 2 adults and 2 kids,had to take a junior suite, since they insisted on this for size of room for the family. When reached there, and checked in, was shocked to discover rooms airconditioning was not working. was told that some govt rule for all aircon units to be switched off, till may end!! and hence no airconditioning! I said that their website details on expedia (through whom i had booked) had no mention of this, and instead mentioned all rooms were airconditioned or comfortably airconditioned... the receptionist just laughed and said must be a mistake! i I protested and said that i had paid full price for airconditioned rooms and if i had known, this in advance or even at the time of checkin, i would have gone somewhere else, but he just shrugged and said something in italian.. since i had paid in advance and in full, i did not want to shift out, and stayed there... spent two nights sweating away, as we could not slept with the windows open, since there were some drainage pipes alongside the window, and the family was scared to leave these windows open.... and we almost suffocated sleeping (while we could) and spent the balance time keeping watch while the windows were open for some short periods, in the night, so that the kids could sleep.... the room was dingy, and depressing, old worn out furniture, skimpy blankets and sheets, decent rooms and bathrooms but not what to expect for the price,had to scamper around for plugs for recharging my laptop/phone(it seemed as if all the plug points were blocked by some blank plates) and the toilets were not working, and had to get this fixed myself, since housekeeping was not receptive. no inroom tea/coffee, change of receptionists every day, so we saw new ones everytime we passed by. when we asked for the free tour to murano, we were told first that the timing was not appropriate (2pm in the noon) and we should probably cut short our earlier scheduled walking tour so that they could offer this to us... We did and the receptionist rather grudgingly, after a lot of grumbling arranged a tour for us at 1.15 in the afternoon. breakfast was some breads, cereals,juices and yogurt, and the service here was pleasantly nice. I had asked for an early checkout to catch a train at 8.00 and was told that the breakfast would be served only at 7.30 and i should see, if the maid had come at that time,and see what i could get at the time. on the day of checkout, i saw a couple of guys sitting for breakfast at 7am,and sat down to grab a sandwich and a cup of tea. the maid was surprised and called in an old man, who asked us to get up and not sit for breakfast since they could not serve us. when i asked why, he told us that they could not serve us, and we would have to come back at 7.30. i just said that my kids wanted to grab a glass of milk and we were off. since they had already started eating, i was not willing to go and heard this guy shouting away. when i checked out, the same guy kept on shouting in italian, and charged me 20 euros per day for the \"breakfast\" for my 3 year old!! for the 2 days. when i asked for the reservation paper he was showing me, i asked for a copy to take the matter up with expdia, he refused, and gave me a receipt for the extra charge only after i refused to pay without a receipt. i was rather shell shocked at this attitude, but was having the train to catch, and was a little harrowed trying to get a family to the station first thing in the morning, hence i just paid and left, else would have argued on this matter. the most unpleasant matter in my entire trip, and have taken the matter up with expedia, for the non airconditioned rooms and the extra breakfast charge, but have not heard anything from them. would not recommend this hotel EVER ! and would strongly discourage anyone from staying here, atleast i would not.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cA Peaceful and Comfortable Stay right at the heart of Venice\u201d", "Author": "benakm", "ReviewID": "UR64880216", "Content": "I remembered it took me quite a while to find this hotel even though it is situated at the center of Venice at San Marco.

The hotel is only a few minutes walk from St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a true Venetian style hotel.

The room was very cute, small and very Venetian and clean as all hotels are in Europe. After checking in we went out for dinner on the waters edge near St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square, it was beautiful. When coming back to the hotel there was another person at the desk and he was much friendlier, thank goodness because we were dreading seeing the same man. We had breakfast included it was just ok. The breakfast room is so small I wouldn't like to see it if the hotel was fully booked. You can have breakfast in-room though. We didn't have much of a view but we were only there for 1 night so we didn't mind. When we go back to Venice we won't be staying at this hotel again, we will try another hotel.

Things to do in Venice: Do a gondola through the lovely canals to the Grand Canal it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely beautiful, visit Murano Glass factory and buy yourself some Murano glass, visit the island of Burano it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 45 minute boat ride from St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square & it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just gorgeous with very friendly locals. Lunch at Romano's restuarant on Burano, it's beautiful food and wine.

All in all, the experience at the hotel was decent, nothing really to complain about. However, one comment on Venetians, for a city that so depends on tourism for its living (and seems to be drowning), the Venetians sure seem to have a tremendous amount of attitude, and very little respect for the tourists. I had a big show down with a Murano glassware shopkeeper, who thought I should buy a 500 Euro vase instantly, with no thought..I gave him a piece of my mind, and told him that while he may not value his products, and think they can be bought like groceries, I did value them, and hoped to keep it in my house like a prized possession...and it was just too sad and bad if he didn't.

We went into a jewellery shop on the square to ask the assistant if he knew our hotel, and although he didn`t know of it, he went out of his way, coming out of the shop to see if there were any true Venetians to help us. There weren`t any locals but we asked at another hotel and although she drew a map for us we still got lost finding the Co-op Travel`s version of Julian. It was really Zulian. On arrival, the gentleman at the check in desk was so so helpful, in fact I could not fault any of the staff, - they gave us directions superbly when we asked them. The only criticism and certainly disappointment was the room. It was accessed via a small courtyard where anybody who worked at the hotel could go and have a cigarette. There was no wardrobe, the floor was marble, and I was absolutely frozen, in fact spent quite a lot of time in the bathroom as it was warmer. I have looked at the photographs of the rooms in the brochure and ours was absolutely nothing like it, but when I asked if all the rooms were the same, I was told they were. I suggested to my partner that I thought I could hear seagulls, but I didn`t think they could fly as far inland, but, as we didn`t have a window to look out of, we thought we would need a periscope to find out. ! Anybody who is going bear this in mind and specificy that you do not want to go in either of the two `new` rooms on the ground floor. Claustrophobics beware.

Outside we were told if we were to leave now we would be taken back but not to were we had started, so there was a 25 minute walk back to the hotel. The glass was expensive and the same glass was sold in their shops in Venice at a cheaper price! We would definately be going back for a long weekend , but next time we are going top choose a hotel with more facilties and one that is out of the hustle and bustle of St Marks Square.", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cRoom with a view\u201d", "Author": "MapAndCompass", "ReviewID": "UR16482342", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel San Zulian in May 2008, in room 107. Our room was clean and pleasant. Although there was no closet or bureau, the room included a nicely-sized wardrobe. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were a bit flatter than what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to. Still, we slept well. The bathroom was clean and the shower rather small, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it goes in Europe! The bathroom included a hairdryer, and also a retractable clothesline, should you decide to do in-room laundry. Breakfast could be taken in the ground floor dining area, or could be delivered to your room for no extra charge. We had it delivered each morning, and it included coffee, juice, rolls, croissants filled with cheese, lunch meats and cheeses, packaged wedges of cheese, and butter and jams. The desk clerk will ask you if you want to have your breakfast delivered, what should be included from the above options, and when it should be delivered. Once you tell them, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring to you each morning at that time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no need to re-order for each day. We said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to everything that was available, and it was enough to get us started for our day. For larger appetites it might seem a bit light, but trust me: you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be eating gelato at least twice a day anyway (gelato stands are everywhere and look very tempting), so save some calories for later. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a restaurant across the street from the hotel entrance, and other restaurants and gelato stands are nearby as well. The hotel is located about halfway between St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square and the Rialto Bridge shopping area, so the main sights are just a few moments away. If you need a bit of help finding the hotel the first time: Exit St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Square (Piazza San Marco) under the bell tower and continue straight on that street until you reach the Ferrari Store \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss it, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right in front of you, with a red Ferrari racing car in the front window. Turn right and continue walking until you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing a church. Turn right at the church, go around to the back wall of the church (counterclockwise), turn right onto the first street, and the hotel will be immediately on your left. Internet access seemed expensive compared to other hotels in other cities, so we found an internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 instead. The front desk staff was helpful and understood English. Each time that you leave the hotel, you need to turn in your key at the front desk. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why but it was one less thing to carry, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind.

We stayed in the annex rooms which were located around the corner from the hotels main enterence and contrary to many reviews we had no problems at all getting access to our room we simply buzzed the reception and were let in.

The Breakfast was spot on and the staff in general very friendly and accomodating except for one member of staff. Having read an earlier review it seems we were not the only people to be coned by this chap so be warned. Whilst walking through reception on our first morning the man behind the desk claimed to have been asked by another young couple if he could find anyone else to share a gondola with them to split the cost.

I saw this room mentioned on trip advisor and that it had a little attic room so I requested this room. Finding the hotel was relatively easy using instructions from the internet and when we arrived the reception staff mentioned that we had secured the attic room! Getting to the room is via some steep steps (well it is in the attic of the hotel) however the views from this room are amazing - I have attached a photo for you to see. It is not often that you have the rooftops of Venice as your view. What a beautiful way to experience this fantastic city! The room was lovely. Comfortable bed, small but very clean bathroom and airconditioning. Breakfast was served in our room each day however with the extra attic room it was enjoyable way to have breakfast. We were close to a couple of bell towers which rang often and produced the most beautiful sound - especially when we had the view that we did. The hotel is located in central San Marco and all the attractions are within 5 mintues walking distance. I would certainly recommend this hotel however at 330 Euro for two nights it is not cheap but certainly worth it. The staff at reception were lovely and provided assisance willingly - directions to a laundromat, internet cafe, restaurants to eat at. The hotel even provides a complimentary trip to Murano Island by water taxi to observe a glass blower in action. Never did we feel under pressure to buy the glass however we did have to find our own way back from the island! A waterbus was sufficient.

It's a bit tricky to find at first, but once you find your way through the warren of alleys and streets, you'll see it takes literally about 3 minutes to get back to the heart of Venice. The hotel was spotlessly clean, the front desk staff exceedingly helpful and friendly, the room was definitely large enough for us (and our 2 weeks worth of junk)and the bathroom, while tight, was generous compared to others we had on our trip. We actually stayed in Venice before and after our cruise; the second weekend we stayed in the Rialto Bridge area. That was nice also, quite a bit less hectic ... but we wished we had returned to Hotel San Zulian. Yes, it's right in the hustle and bustle, but the rooms are soundproof and we didn't hear a thing. We loved having breakfast brought to us in the morning; it added to the luxurious feeling of being in Venice! And no, the hotel is not \"near\" the canals... but trust me, you'll see the canals all day long -- you don't really need to pay lots more to see them from your hotel room! And really, nothing is far from a canal in Venice... if you can't see a canal, just walk another 5 feet and you'll see one!You will love this hotel and its convenient location, especially if you are just arriving from the airport with all your bags. (Word of advice... pack light! It can be tough rolling your suitcase on the cobbled stones, and around people in the narrow streets) There's a great little stand-up or take-away pizza place behind the hotel - highly recommend for a good, quick, cheap meal! We went on the free hotel-sponsored trip to Murano and had an escorted tour through the the Gritti factory & museum/gift shop. Obviously the guide was on commisssion but believe it or not, there was no sales pressure and we enjoyed the experience. It doesn't cost much to take the ACTV watertaxi out to Murano; you definitely should make time to see the glassblowers in action and the incredible selection of glass products in the factory showcases. We thought it was a lovely little island, and some of our best canal photos were taken here. Again, I can't recommend this hotel highly enough for price-conscious travellers. I don't mean that it's a low budget hotel, not at all! It's just a very good buy for your money when you look at the price, location, convenience, customer service and accomodations.

The attic room has a small verandah which has been glazed, giving you an all weather viewing room from which to survey the romantic city rooftops and bell towers. On Sunday mornings, you can lie in bed and listen to the bells of the many churches. Another huge plus was breakfast served in our room, every day, at no extra charge. I believe this is due to the hotel having either a very small or non existent dining room - they don't serve any meals other than breakfast. This was a huge bonus for us and breakfast in bed became a week long luxury. The hotel's excellent location meant we were within walking distance of many sights, restaurants and cafes so the lack of dining facilities in the hotel was irrelevant.
