Its quite a no frills sorta place but has full kitchen which saves a LOT of money in Los Angeles!Decent ,clean&modern rooms with free parking and free internet etc only thing is there is no breakfast.Please provide at least coffee and donuts? The staff and manager is whats most valuable about this hotel.They ALL go out of their way to make you comfotable and provide good service which was really refreshing because in LA you usually get attitude but not here!I dont remember all the names but the manager is a young indian girl and she made sure we enjoyed out stay and even small problem like toilet not flushing was fixed immediately by a really nice man called Fredy. I would suggest try to get a room in the back for easy access and quiet .

After I arrived at the hotel I went to lie down for a few minutes. There were MANY hairs on the pillows (not mine). There was blood on the pillow cases (not mine). And there was blood on the pillows (yep, you guessed it: not mine). Got new pillows, no problem. Hoped things would improve from there. Went for a run before my interview and came back to find that the hotel does not provide ANY shampoo. So I had to run to Target about a mile away, after being told it was a block away-- to get shampoo. I had less than 30 mins to run to get shampoo and then get ready for my interview (which is an issue for someone with really long hair, like me.) After I got out of the shower I realized that there was also no hair dryer. So I called the front desk and said, \"Do you have a hair dryer I could use?\" And his response was, \"We don't know where it is.\" ... So I went to my interview with really wet hair. It was embarrassing, to say the least. The next day, only one outlet and light worked --electricity went out in most of the room and they said there was nothing they could do. Then the hot water went out. I took a freezing cold shower and mentioned to the person whom I was interviewing with that she \"should really ask for your money back\"...She felt bad and so I ended up staying with her and her family...which is great b/c they are really nice people, but also probably awkward for them to have unexpected house-guests. I really not at all a picky person, I just feel that if you are going to pay a good deal for a hotel, there should be some sort of minimum standards. I've stayed in cheap Super 8's and they were much cleaner, with shampoo and a hairdryer in each room. I think Extended Stay America has some serious issues with this hotel's location. ps: also --there was smoke smell in my room and I am allergic to smoke.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cThe Extended Stay\u201d", "Author": "RobGeorgia", "ReviewID": "UR121503072", "Content": "Found the hotel clean and staff friendly. Behind the hotel is a Marie Calanders (restaurant) and the only issue I had had to do with the hotel parking.

You know how you pull up to a place and get a *bad* feeling? That was us here... There were two unsavory looking men loitering in front smoking, looking like they lived there and had nothing to do but loiter in front of the hotel, watching arrivals. We entered the lobby to check in, but there was (very obviously) a prostitute and her (very obvious) John checking in. In the lobby seated on the couch, was another seriously unsavory looking man with clearly nothing else to do but watch the world go by. Husband and I looked at each other and decided to leave. I made up some lame excuse to the guy about having to turn around and go home, and we weren't charged. Went to another hotel in the area. In a nutshell, this is a place that houses ex-con parolees and prostitutes. I've heard of places like this housing released prisoners. I can't imagine anyone wanting to stay in a place such as this, nor could I imagine children being here.
