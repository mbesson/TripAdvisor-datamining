We enjoyed the comfort suite combined with a connected next door standard room for the children. The hotel obliges you to have an additional in case you want to have 2 children on your room. I do unsterstand this measure for a standard room because these are indeed too small for 2 adults and 2 children. I do not understand this for the suites because there's plenty of room to have to seperated beds for the children. Anyhow, we enjoyed our very spacious rooms with our own private sauna and whirlpool and a seperate toilet and shower. I love carrera marble and the whole bathroom is out of it! There's a seperate elevator next to the suites directly to the pool. I do not like air conditioning. So, I liked the option to put out the airco system and just to open a window for some fresh air. One negative point was the fact that the speaker in the bathroom did not fuction and that some part of the wooden interior of the sauna was brooken. The breakfast is just perfect; high quality ingredients and a lot of choice! Ask for your personal coffee. If you book online you get a 40% discount on the breakfast. The staff is very friendly and professional. Children are very welcome (which is not always the case in 5 star hotels).The hotel is very well located! We did Berlin by car.

The room was large, clean and offered most of what you expect of this kind of hotel. The beds where very comfortable. There are two things that should be improved though: First, as more and more hotels offer free internet access, the Esplanade's outrageously expensive fee for internet access seems like a rip-off. Second, coffee making facilities in the room would be great. The rooms are very well sound-isolated. Breakfast in the Esplanade met all expectations. It was included in the price of our room (we had a stay 4 nights-package price). A chef prepared freshly made eggs and omelets, and the selection of fruit, yoghurts, bread etc. was satisfying. The hotel's pool and spa was quite nice. The massage and spa treatments are not cheap, but according to the one person in our group that tried them, they are great. The pool is small, but since there where relatively few people using it during our stay, this was no problem. The location of the hotel has both advantages and disadvantages. It is between the Tiergarten, Potsdamer Platz and Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. All these attractions are within walking distance. For other attraction, bus or taxi is the best option. A disadvantage is that there is no U-bahn-station in close proximity to the hotel, you have to walk 10 minutes or so to get to one. If you are arriving from Tegel, taking a taxi from/to the airport is propably most convienient. The fare is between 15 and 20 euros. The price of our stay was not bad at all, considering the standard of the hotel and size of the room.

I travel regularly all around the world - I know that hotels like to overcharge for using the internet. But that didn't alleviate my complete shock when I checked out of the Esplanade and found out that I'd been charged 170 Euros for using wi-fi in my room for six night's stay! Why so expensive? Because they apply the charge for each device you want to use, rather than allow you to purchase one charge for the room. As nearly everyone has more than one device (laptop, smartphone, etc) these days, it's the stone age for them to operate this policy but their reply was a snippy, \"Every hotel does this.\" Uh, no, they don't. They also tried to charge me 300 euros for a sink I reported to be faulty, blaming me for the fault even though it was clearly pre-existing. This battle I did win but only after an extremely unpleasant exchange. They also charged me the cost of two breakfasts for every day of my stay, even though my partner only stayed for two nights. Also, the hotel's food, including breakfast, wasn't all that great (the room service club sandwich is truly one of the worst I've ever had), the location's not great and the front desk and concierge were haughty.

The heating system annoyed us howewer as we could not control the temperature ourselves. The in-room air condition didnt seem to have much effect, this resulting in us opening the windows at times to let some chill breezes come in to the room. I mean, come on Esplanade, who likes to sleep in 27-28 degrees heat all night in January? At least not us norwegians for sure.. There should also have been a full body mirror in the entr\u00e9 to the suite. 6 euro for a bottle of water, I don\u00b4t even want to comment on that. Go to a local store and buy your water for 0, 60 euros. Nice bathroom with shower and bathtub, good selection of amenities. Toothbrushes are free of charge, first time I have seen that in a hotel. The breakfast buffet was very nice, look out for special offers on it as the standard rate of 22 euros is a tad bit to much for what you get I think. The swimming pool/gym/spa area was quite nice. Harrys new york bar \u2013 a safe bet if you are in need of a late night cocktail. I have read some comments here about rude staff in the bar. We were treated nicely. Only downside was that they didnt have live music on a saturday night. The employees were polite and nice, but not \"all smiles\". This is afterall germany. Ordnung muss sein. Very efficient front desk. They did however charge/reserve some kind of deposit (ca 100 euros) on my stay, without letting me know. This has now been replaced. A simple notice would have been fine. The location is ok, there is nothing much in the immidiate surrounding area but it is not far to the main attractions in Berlin. Taxis are by the way ridicioulosly inexpensive in Berlin. There is also an bus stop 2 min from the hotel. The tube station (Nollendorfplatz) is a 8-10min walk from the hotel. For choices in the area try restaurants \u201cMaharadsja\u201d (Indian) and \u201cIl Valentino\u201d (Italian). Both have gotten favourable reviews on tripadvisor. \u201cBar am L\u00fctzowplatz\u201d looked like a good choice for drinks. We paid 139 euro a night for an executive suite (about 55-60m2). That is indeed good value for money, off course not only judging by the size but foremost by quality. Exellent beds and linens! Housekeeping did their job to our satisfaction.

Overall, the hotel is spotless, comfortable and very much lives up to its 5* rating in this respect. The rooms were cleaned every day to a high standard, the staff were helpful and the pool was really lovely, albeit slightly cold. However, it was ludicrously expensive!! I've never stayed in a 5* hotel before so maybe I'm just naive in that department but I was under the illusion that paying a lot of money for a hotel room basically brought with it a few luxuries other than comfort?? We arrived at the hotel after a long trip and were greeted with a very pleasant receptionist. We were then showed to our room by the concierge and we settled in our lovely room for the night. My partner opened the mini bar as we were very hungry, only to find a bottle of water was 6 euro and a packet of nuts was 4 euro. Again, may be this is the norm. But seriously, they shouldn't be allowed to sell things at those prices. We ventured down to the restuarant, glanced at the menu and then left again...there was no way we were paying 20 euro for a burger. The hotel wouldn't be that bad if there was a shop or off licence near by but there is NOTHING. We ended up walking for about 20 minutes to get something to eat or drink and ended up getting on the subway to find something. Not a great welcome to Berlin. Admittedly, if we were that hungry we could have paid those prices but I really think that 'luxury' hotels play on the fact that wealthy businessmen stay there who can claim on expenses and unfortunately, the hotel definitely fits this bill. It is extremely 'businessy' and lacks a lot of charm and character. The hotel is huge so we very rarely saw other guests, except for a businessman spending nearly 150 euros on three beers and food in the restaurant one night. On the last night we decided to splurge and order sparkling wine on room service. I had bought this in advance during the booking stage so they bought it to our room, we opened it and it had corked. When I called them to replace it, they took an hour to bring a new one up. We'd gone to bed by this point. The breakfast was stupidly expensive (there's no way I would ever pay 5 euros for a croissant...) so we never ordered any. Harry's bar is very pretentious and the rude barman kept our change from a 20 euro note when our bill only came to 12. The people that go in there are snotty and stuck up so we steered clear. There was also an event taking place on one of the nights that looked akin to a film premier...lets just say that when we returned to the hotel from our day's sightseeing, we were looked up and down by photographers and glared at by the guests. I definitely won't be staying here again but if you're a businessman looking for comfort, this is right up your street!!!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hampshire", "Title": "\u201cnot quite 5 star\u201d", "Author": "maddyHampshire", "ReviewID": "UR122568080", "Content": "i stayed here with my spouse for three nights over the new year period. we enjoyed our stay and i would definately stay here again. however, although the hotel is rated 5 star, and there are many good points, there are also one or two areas of improvement needed. GOOD POINTS 1. staff were always helpful and polite 2. everywhere was spotlessly clean 3. our room was very comfortable, clean, and well appointed 4. breakfast was delicious with a wide choice of hot and cold items 5. decoration of whole hotel was of an excellent standard, the style is modern 6. the bedding is very high quality and therefore very comfortable 7. the hotel is well situated, it is possible to walk to many sights in the city 8. the hotel is on the banks of the canal giving it a quiet, but reasonably central situation POINTS FOR IMPROVEMENT 1. charge of over 6 euros for small bottle of water in room - 5 star establishments normally provide complementary water 2. heating in room wasn't operative the whole 3 days we were there, the radiator was cold, and the blown air heating appeared to be faulty, it didn't work. upon telephoning to relay this information, 2 young girls were despatched to our room with a small fan heater. they fiddled with the buttons, felt the radiator and advised us to turn everything off and use the fan heater. although we were not especially cold due to using the fan heater, and also the rest of the hotel was very warm - therefore our room contained some of the heat from the rest of the hotel - we felt that for a 5 star establishment, this was an inadequate response 3. chocolates are placed beside the bed each evening, but on our last night they did not materialise. again, for a 5 star establishment, this is unacceptable 4. no DVD player in room, again not good enough for 5 star 5. no computer access available, since tourists do not usually carry their laptops with them, it is impossible to check in for your flight on line, therefore obliging you to stand in a long line at the airport, and possibly, like us, not therefore being able to sit together on the aircraft 6. for those who do take a laptop, usually business people, the internet charges are over 6 euros per hour - perhaps hotel management feel this is acceptable for businesses to pay, however many hotels offer free internet as i stated earlier, i would stay here again, however my husband said he would not stay again, as he felt the hotel makes unnecessary charges on top of an already high rate, which in particular, hit the tourist more than the business person, who usually have all their costs met by their company. the hotel will provide a kettle, cups and milk if asked. we took a few teabags up from breakfast aswell, so we could enjoy a cup of tea when we returned from sight seeing. there is a small grocery store just around the corner where you can buy water and soft drinks for a very small price, if like me, you need to carry water with you at all times.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel exceptionally friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Vivienne-youngFamily", "ReviewID": "UR122514344", "Content": "I stayed with 3 young children, hotel was spotless and the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming.

Everything from booking to check out was without fault. As we didnt have a credit card, we emailed the hotel to enquire about an alternative means of payment to which they replied that a bank transfer would work. Astrid, a hotel employee, was extremely helpful with regards to booking the hotel. Again, when checking in, as we had no credit card, a cash deposit was accepted to cover any room service charges or accidentials. This is definately a big plus! We had booked a executive suite and it didnt disappoint! A large living room area was seperated for the main bedroom area. This was perfect for relaxing in after a long day of sightseeing around a wonderful city. The bed was extremely comfortable and the hotel's evening turndown service was a very nice touch. The bathroom was more than adequate. Terrific shower, large bath and very spacious. Roasting hot water on every occassion. Absolutely no complaints here. We ate in the hotel once. We took advantage of the dry weather and ate outside under a heater. This is a lovely area for just relaxing and people watching. The food was also first class. On our final night we had a few cocktails in Harrys Bar which was a great experience. We also used the Gym which was more than sufficiently kitted out. We didnt get a chance to use the pool but it also looked really nice! The location of the hotel would not exactly be classed as city centre but it is in a beautifl location on the banks of the river. It is a 1/2 mile from the nearest U-bahn station (Nollendorfplatz) which takes you to all the places of interest in a few minutes and is very easy to navigate. Berlin is a lovely City with plenty to do. A hop on, hop off bus tour is usually the best way to see a city. But in Berlin, be careful which company you use. We got tickets for a bus tour for Tempelhofer (http://www.tempelhofer.de/bct.htm) and were told it was in a live english speaking tour. It was quite the opposite. It was lead by an old guy who spoke mostly in German and mumbled a few english sentences on occassions. We perservered for about half the tour but the final straw came when a police escorted cascade of black limos passed us, obviously containing VIP's of the political world (Korean Flags if I'm not mistaking) and the guy never even spoke one word about them...even in German. In my opinion, thats the reason to take a live tour so the guide can speak about things that happen in the spur of the moment. We got of at the next stop and never looked back. This was a blessing in disguise as we then went and done a walking tour. By far the best way to see Berlin. It was throught the 'Original Berlin Walks' company and it was absolutely brilliant! Our guide, David, was brilliant; informative, knowledgeable and very funny. I cant recommend this tour highly enough! I will be doing a review on their tripadvisor page in due course. But overall, getting back to the hotel, we had a great stay in the Grand Hotel Esplanade. The only negative I would say is that the use of the internet is slightly over priced but if its a relaxing holiday you are after then this can be overlooked.

Compared to Grand Hyatt at Potsdamer Platz, the location is a bit further away from the center, meaning Unter den Linden, Museum Island and so on. We had a car, so it was not so much a problem \u2013 in fact, I would recommend getting a car in Berlin; the public transportation is somewhat slow albeit abundant. Berlin is a sprawling city, and the distances between attractions are enormous. Let\u2019s say Berlin is definitely not a walking city; perhaps it befits the spirit of Prussian grandeur that everything is given ample space to not feel crumped. The inspiration of the city and its love for enormity is best expressed by hotels like Esplanade and places like Gendarmenmarkt. For a traveler who demands comfort this could be a blessing, since Berlin boasts spacious ultra-modern hotels like Esplanade, which seem to cater to every whim except being boutique and charming. What was a little surprising on that scale was that the pool in Esplanade is not huge, compared to Grand Hyatt; however, it is heated in Esplanade, which is better than in Hyatt where it is beautiful but unusable since ice-cold. At the same time, in Esplanade the pool is in the basement and there is no hot tub, while in Grand Hyatt you have a marvelous hot tub at the top floor, with an open-air solarium and a splendid panorama over Berlin and Philarmonie. The bathroom in our room was also simpler than in Hyatt, while the bed was more comfortable \u2013 I think Esplanade probably has the most comfortable bed in Germany! The room is spacious, and there is plenty of closet space; I also liked the colors - pastel yellow, which gave it a warm touch (in Hyatt the steel-grey palette radiates coldness and sharp angles; in Esplanade it is more soft and rounded, which I prefer personally). The best thing was the concierge Johnny who recommended a great restaurant Hartmann's (Fichtestra\u00dfe 31, 10967 Berlin) - we had a splendid dinner there, with French-style cuisine; I liked it so much that I also wrote an illustrated review of Harmann\u2019s here on TripAdvisor \u2013 take a look. I liked everything, it is a very good choice between Hyatt and Concorde - the location is not as good as Hyatt but perhaps better than at Concorde; as I mentioned, compared to Concorde, Esplanade has a pool. The corridors are really long and huge in Esplanade, but this is the case with modern hotels. All in all, Esplanade is a very good place to stay, service is superb. I notice from other reviews that personnel seems rude; I observe that Germans are generally more curt and reserved that Americans, and sometimes appear abrupt. They may also retort an opinion to a hotel guest, which could come across as shocking to an American. It is true they are not as sugary sweet as here it the States, not to what one might get used to in NYC hotels, where staff are so exceedingly nice that sometimes sugar seem to drop from their lips when they speak to a customer. I would attribute German attitude to cultural difference, not to rudeness; it seems as this is just not a tradition there to be so exceedingly obsequious and always smiling; however, in Esplanade I found the staff very helpful and efficient, and we enjoyed our stay there, I would eagerly come back. In general, I found in East Germany hotel staff is much more friendly and caring than in West, in Munich or Koln, for example. It feels in Berlin that they really want your business and welcome you at their German best. It was my third time in Berlin, and I fall in love more and more with this great city of culture, art and music, generous cuisine and attitude, and I wish to be back soon, including marvelous stays in hotels like Esplanade and Hyatt.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious bedding, cool pool/sauna, great staff, fab bar!\u201d", "Author": "WorriedMomDC", "ReviewID": "UR116189495", "Content": "Really enjoyed this hotel-- a nice oasis in Berlin, which still feels like a city in transition.

It wasn't great for relaxing there because of this. Girlfriend could only spend 10 mins in there while I was in the gym. Also, the pool is triangular and a bit on the small side. More for going for a dip than swimming a few lengths. The gym itself is ok for casual travelling users. More than one serious user and you would have an issue as although there were a few cardio machines, there was only one bench which I felt I was hogging doing my workout.

The gym and pool were free of charge and large enough to have a work out. As you can expect, minibar drinks and the hotel's own restaurants and other services (e.g. spa) are rather pricy - but no need to use them, Lidl and MiniMarket are nearby and Berlin has lots to offer when it comes to eating out and going for drinks. Only real minus was the air con that we would have liked a bit cooler especially at night times as the weather was great with 30 degrees celsius and clear sky.

A few minor details: Second day ... no clean towels in badroom, 3 days with the same soapbar (we did not get a new one), the little shampoo was already used by the guests before us (half empty) and will probably be used by the guest after us. This hotel has a 5-stars ranking in booking and tripadvisor, but personaly I think that to earn the 5th star even those minor details have to be ok!

There were mainly business folk there during our stay but more holiday makers arrived to give it a more relaxed feel. The price of food is expensive though so you might want to eat elsewhere. I would recommend Harry's Cocktail bar, expensive but exquisite. Nearest U-Bahn is a five minute walk away (Nollendorf) and there are cafes dotted around near the hotel. City centre is approx 15 minute walk if you fancy it. Zoo is 10 minutes walk away. I would say that there are more restaurants and cafes in Mitte (centre of Berlin) but there are some on the Ku'Damn just 15 minutes from the hotel. Taxi from Schonefeld Airport cost 40 euros or you could get the airport express to the zoo then taxi to hotel. If you want a stress free, high class hotel in a quiet area this is it.

Check-in was not a problem. When we arrived in our room, again you could not fail to be impressed. Nice and modern looking, bathroom was a good size and very nice. The problem came when we looked out of our window - no river view as we had booked! I thought I had maybe mis-read my booking but no, I had indeed booked a \"river view\" room. All I could see was the back of the foyer/lobby roof all made of glass and had bright blue lights shining back at us. Now bear in mind there is no river running through Berlin, but more of a canal, I still expected more from the view from our room. Anyway, I proceeded to make my way to reception to say there must have been some mix-up with the room. The girl on reception was fairly helpfull in that she arranged for another room higher up in the hotel but did admit that none of the rooms have much of a view - bear that in mind if you think of paying the extra for the \"river view\"!!! Finally got our new room which did have a slightly better view, but the cleanliness was not up to the standard you would expect. Clearly some guest had children with them before us as the window in certain light was covered in small hand and finger prints. Again, not much of a problem just another little one to add to the list. Then behind the curtains at the top of the window were cobwebs which had clearly been there some time. Again, just another little problem. The bathroom was nice but we did notice drainage smells every now and then, but having stayed in many hotels in London you get used to this smell!!!! My biggest complaint comes with the lack of any supply of tea and coffee making facilities in the room. I searched high and low and could not find anything at all (other that the ridiculously over-priced mini bar!) so I contacted reception again and they confirmed they do not provide this facility. Well in all my time travelling and staying in hotels of every class/star rating known to man, I have never known not ever been supplied with this. It wouldn't be so bad if breakfast was not so expensive - somewhere in the region of \u00a327. But the girl \"helpfully\" said that we could order room service of tea/coffee if we wanted!!!! Still the bottled water at \u00a36 a throw in the room would quwnch your thirst! On a positive, the restaurants and bars in the hotel are excellent. No faults there you will be pleased to hear. Overall, we found this hotel a bit of a let-down. Just minor things that you would expect a hotel of this standard to get right. But it seems sometimes the more you pay, the less you get. But I have to say what a great place Berlin is. Fantastic at Christmas.

That being said we paid a very competitive rate for a juniour suite compared to some other hotels. The suite itself was beautiful and afforded a great view of the city and could not be faulted. Similarly the bar and lobby were bright and comfortable and the overall service was top class.. There are a few faults however that whould stop me recommending the place unreservedy. The price of the breakfast at \u20ac24 per head is exorbetent. My wife and I stayed for 3 nights and breakfast would have cost us just short of \u20ac150????????. I did have a look and it did look very good but not worth that. The hotel is not ideally situated and is a bit of a trek from the main sights and is not adjacent to any underground...about a 10-15 minute walk. Whilst there was a minibar in the room there was also a bottle of water left out on the sideboard. Having presumed this was complimentary We were surprised to find that we were charged for same on each night (\u20ac4 per bottle I think). This seemed unfair as there was no clear marking of pricee on the bottle and it is not unreasonable to expect it to be complmentary when not in the minibar. There is an extra charge of \u20ac9 to use the sauna...again that strikes me as expensive to say the least. The above sounds very negative which does not really reflect my view of the hotel which all in all was very good and I would consider staying there if in Berlin again especially with favourable pricing. I just feel that a few little details need to be looked at before I would class it as a true 5 star experience", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Liz0101", "ReviewID": "UR50087359", "Content": "This hotel was very nicely appointed and the staff very friendly and accommodating.

The hotel is on the southern edge of the Tiergarten, which is just out of range of walking to see the Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden and Potsdamer Platz. As I arrived in the afternoon, and would have to leave for the airport by check-out time at 12.00pm the next day, I had limited time to get out and about, and the staff at the hotel were extremely helpful in getting me oriented, providing maps and advice on the easist transport options - which turned out to be the day pass on the no. 100 bus. The hotel itself is reassuringly five-star plush, quiet, clean and comfortable. My only gripe - reflected in the score for the rooms - was that I had requested a non-smoking room and was advised on check-in that I had been allocated one. Sadly, despite this, the room stank from the previous occupant, and opening windows was not possible, as they open only a few inches. I suggested that smoking in non-smoking rooms should be enforced more in my exit survey. I was also slightly disconcerted that my non-smoking room was on the 6th floor - which is a smoking floor. Getting from the room to the elevator and back was not pleasant.

It was exactly as it looked on the hotel's photogallery and that was a pleasant surprise. Even though it was winter and almost 0' degrees celcius outside, the room was very very warm. The bed was huge and comfortable. Bed linen and towels were changed on a daily basis and in general the room was very clean. The hotel's location - even though not very central - was quite convenient, about 7-8 minutes walk from the nearest metro station (Nollendorfplatz) and about 25 minutes walk from Potzdamer Platz.

Fantastic \"Harry's Bar\" with a huge selection of drinks at a fair price. Great food in the restaurant and an outstanding breakfast untill 12.00 am on Sunday - great as we got home from the concert pretty late !!

There are also some restaurants & cafes very close to the hotel (if you walk around the area that the hotel is located you can easily find them) 6. To & From Tegal airport, get a taxi, it was only around 16 \u2013 17 euros. 7. Buy the city tour cart (by this way you can save money when using the public transport & get great discounts in many tourist attractions) 8.

The only country that hotels offer tea/coffee making facilities is England.

Last we had a quite exceptional fixed price lunch at the Esplanade (Euros70). ..though we only discovered they did it by accident. Not advertised .We liked the foyer design and the waiting staff were friendly so we decided to try a room. They no longer do that lunch deal and have closed the Michelin starred restaurant (Vivos) . We booked online through the hotel site. A junior suite on a package that included b'fast and use of sauna. When we arrived there was a problem with the booking...others here have also had problems we see. Initially the receptionists seemed to sort it but then said the rate would be higher...by this time they had my CC...when I asked how much they said they didn't know. After some discussion they got their boss who was very helpful. Mysteriously he came up with a totally different rate....though not a package one. If we had used the sauna as intended we would have paid overall a little more. The difference was Euros20ish so I said that was fine, checked it again and wrote it down on the room card. The Junior suites are on the top ..7th floor. Superficially the are very attractive ...good colour palette, lots of space and individual terraces. However the views don't include any of Berlin's sights as they are the back of the hotel...why they arn't at the front overlooking the canal and on to Potsdamer Platz is a complete mystery. The suites quickly become annoying. There is no hanging space in the entrance lobby so you have to take (wet) coats right to the wardrobes past a narrow choke point with the bed/desk. The bathroom is poorly laid out...double basins but no worksurface space. The loo is situated so you can be seen from the bed if you leave the door ajar. However designed them should return their fee. It is impossible to pass a member of staff at our normal hotels in Berlin without being pleasantly greeted......here we found some of the domestic staff surly. Evening room service was far too early. It's the only time I have not left a room tip in many years. The sauna is very clean as is the pool but totally impersonal....there is no bar and is just not a place to relax. You actually enter through an unmarked door in the basement which sets the tone. The lounge area is wonderfully designed...but the open fire and heating are insufficient to allow one to dwell on a cold night over a nightcap. The B'fast restaurant is impersonal and not designed for a lingering b'fast...it's aimed at the business traveller. However again the waiting/chef staff couldn't be faulted. However I could have forgiven all this if it had not been for checkout. I checked my bill on screen before my final b'fast and found that I had not been charged the agreed rate, not even the higher rate but the higher rate plus the extra none package charges. At reception was the original check -in receptionist...she claimed she didn't remember the problem when we booked in. To be fair when we got the duty manager it was sorted amicably and easily....the change was on the system as a note but the girl done what was necessary to change the accounting system. Even at this stage I might have just put it all down to things going wrong and bad luck. But we paid and were asked if we ,wanted to pay in UK pounds'. This is the sort of exchange rate' scam' you expect in a cheap Bangkok restaurant not a 5* Berlin hotel. I felt is summed up the hotel...impersonal and margin driven.", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA good deal\u201d", "Author": "Trinman80", "ReviewID": "UR14558497", "Content": "A good deal overall.

Included a selection of made to order eggs (including omelettes and scrambled) and also pancakes together with Bacon, sausages cold cuts, pastries cereal, fruit, Yogurt and a wide selection of juice, tea and coffee. Very tasty a good hearty breakfast saw us through to the early evening everyday. So that we could enjoy some Mulled wine and sausages from the markets. The rooms were large and comfortable and the bed was divine and fantastic to sleep in. We had a big screen TV, but there was a very limited selection of English speaking channels. Only downsides from our perspective were: - Lack of Smoke free areas (Hotel and Berlin in General) - Lack of tea and coffee facilities (who am I kidding this is only an issue for poor people such as myself living it up in 5 stars) - Lack of English speaking TV (this was only an issue of a night time and early morning as very little time is spent watching TV) The pool and Sauna were very nice, although we only ever went and looked we never actually used them.

The room was of a very decent size, as was the bathroom. We used and absolutely loved the swimming pool in the basement. Very tranquil. The breakfast buffet is the probably the best I have experienced: loads of different types of bread and cheese, fresh juice, fresh fruits, loads of sorts of cereals to choose from, etc. The only gripe we had was that, back then (2004) there weren't any proper separation between smoking and non-smoking areas, and we hate having to go through our meals with smoking table neighbours. The hotel also has a very good restaurant serving real german cuisine, very hearty. We had diner there which we absolutely loved.

We didn't have breakfast but had meals in the Ecke bar and Harry's bar which were both very good quality and served by attentive and friendly staff. The only thing that wasn't perfect for us was the location but it's certainly not out of the way. It's walking distnace to the Sony Centre and close to an U-bahn station.
