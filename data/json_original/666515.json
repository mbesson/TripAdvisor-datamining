{"Reviews": [{"Content": "New  The Garden Hotel was about 5 mins walking distance from the nearest station but we used mostly taxi because it was heavily raining and our 10 month-old baby was with us. Hotel is very new and fancy, and our room looked very clean with new electronic devices. It was very small room, though. I guess we all have to expect that in Japan. For those who would like to experience Japanese public bath, there is one at the top floor. Of course men and women are separated. Breakfast buffet was satisfactory.", "Date": "Nov 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR503301340", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Midoringo"}, {"Content": "More Italian or Japanese? The only reason why I stayed at this hotel is that it is literally next to my Japanese office. This new (less than 2 years old) hotel in a new district Minato-ku is certainly playing up to some Japanese's liking for some things Italian. The only restaurant in the hotel only serves Italian/Japanese buffet, so if you're a Japanese food purist, the restaurant is not for you. However, the breakfast appears traditional Japanese though. The hotel and room has nice clean lines, and the rooms of moderate size for a city notorious for the smallish rooms. Swinging to the other end of its schizo spectrum, the tv channels are all Japanese, so no CNN or BBC for you. 1 of the selling points is the traditional japanese public bath, which I guess is pretty for the international business traveller to at least experience it once. At the very least, the locals seem to enjoy it.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR666976373", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bcheong"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d666515-r21561089-Mitsui_Garden_Hotel_Shiodome_Italia_gai-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "666515", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
