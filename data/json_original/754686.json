It's located at the east end of the strip, right across from Fall Creek Road, so you can skirt the busy strip to get to your location faster. Super nice staff and an amazing price.

The price was very reasonable and was the main reason we stayed. The room was clean, the shower worked great, and it even had a microwave and fridge which seemed like quite the bonus for how cheap it was. The only complaint i would have would be the amount of time it took to check in and out. It was only a minor hassle, just noticed that it took quite a bit longer checking in and out then I'm used to.

Carpet looked to be new, bathroom was spotless. Lots of towels. FOUR pillows on each bed was wonderful for propping up and watching TV. There was a coffee maker, microwave and refridgerator in the room. The pool area was landscaped nicely - flower beds beautifully done. Soda machines only one dollar - which is rare anywhere these days. The down side of this place was 75 cent phone calls from the room (use your cell phone). No free continental breakfast - but there was a buffet that was 3.99 which didn't include beverages - those cost extra. Our trip included Silver Dollar City and White Water which was quite a long ways from the hotel so keep that in mind and remember how congested traffic is and plan accordingly. The hotel is very close to Branson Landing though. Over all, I was pleased. I will definately stay here again because it is inexpensive and clean with friendly front desk employees.

We went inside the main office and could tell it was better than we had thought by the outside appearance. The room had a nice leather couch and a great King size bed that we estimate to be a 15\" mattress, the bathroom was clean and the towels were nice, which is a great indicator of a hotels frugality. The bed also came with about 8 nice pillows, and I love pillows, so this impressed me.

The room was ok, but didn't have the promised leather sofa, although we saw rooms that had this. The room - the bed was comfortable enough with plenty of pillows but very rough sheets - beware if you have sensitive skin! The bathroom was ok here were the problems (1) toilet ran off & on all the time, so we just closed the door to sleep; (2) water not quite hot enough in the shower; and (3) if your tall you will have to deal with very short shower head.
