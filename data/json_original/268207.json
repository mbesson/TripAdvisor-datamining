The Freedom Walk Trail is right in front of the motel and you have both Bunker Hill and the USS Ironsides within view of the front of the motel The room was more like a small apartment with a king bedroom that had a huge television in front of the very comfortable bed. Pillows and Sheets were both top notch! The living room had a fold out couch, a computer table, a small kitchen table, another huge TV and a small kitchen with a full sized refrigerator that saved us from having to eat every meal out at a restaurant. We didn't really interact with the staff other than having to check in and out so I cant really comment on them, but when ever we saw them in passing, they were always cordial. Our view out the window was stellar. It overlooks a nice marina with beautiful boats to gawk at. One night was a full moon and watching it rise over the Boston Harbor was pretty unforgettable. One word to guests checking in. If you're room faces the USS Ironsides, keep your curtains closed in the morning for the rising sun will blind you or wake you up if you want to sleep in Parking in the Marina parking will also save you some money. Valet should have been $35 per night, but parking in the Marina for 3 days only costs us $25 total.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Foggia, Italy", "Title": "\u201cA nice place by the water.\u201d", "Author": "Domi0411", "ReviewID": "UR118098522", "Content": "Our family of 5 stayed in a 2 bedroom-suite.

First, the staff: On arrival, we met Geraldine at the front desk and felt like we would be \"at home\" all week. I almost hate mentioning people by name because EVERY staff member all week in this hotel was first-rate and I don't remember any other names!!. Geraldine just set the stage for us to be impressed. I regret not remembering the names of the five or six folks who staffed the breakfast area throughout the week. The hotel was VERY full and lots of international travelers were at breakfast each morning. It was hectic and there were many special requests. The staff never failed to smile; always appeared \"out of nowhere\" when you needed help or your child spilled while serving himself from the buffet; and to boot, one sweet staffer kept appearing with little party treats for the kids. These were penny/party store plastic trinkets but my kids were tickled to death to be treated so specially. I cannot stress enough how calm, friendly and professional the staff are here. One of my children had an accident in the night and was mortified we had to call the front desk for clean-up help early in the morning. Not only did the woman at the desk calmly dispatch clean linens and the friendliest of housekeeping representatives, she offered to send up a treat for my daughter. Bravo for probably the best Marriott staffing we've encountered anywhere . . . and we almost always stay in Marriotts. Location: FABULOUS. Our rooms faced the spectacular modern Bunker Hill bridge and a vista of both center city and Cambridge buildings beyond. We were in #818 and grandparents were next door in #816. LARGE, clean rooms. Perfect view -- even if the view toward the Harbor would have been better. We went to the USS Constitution park area each morning (a 5 minute walk ) and either jumped on a bus or into a taxi to start our sightseeing day. We could have hailed cabs right at the hotel . . . but the Constitution is such a gorgeous ship, my hubby, my father, and my son all wanted to start their days under its impressive masts. Note: I never thought I'd recommend any trolley tour company in any city . . . but we used Upper Deck/Super Tours two-day ticket and saw all of Boston and Cambridge with really knowledgeable drivers. Traveling with grandparents and small kids, this tour option was a LIFESAVER and helped us decide where we wanted to visit during the rest of our week. Note: If you're a city dweller used to walking everywhere, this hotel is hugely walkable to most of Boston tourism hotspots. It sits ON the Freedom Trail. My husband and I loved walking to the North End Italian restaurants several different evenings. Crossing the Charlestown Bridge was fun on foot . . . in June. I can imagine it's pretty brutal in the winter or in a rainstorm, so plan accordingly. Take some time to just relax and enjoy the hotel's \"grounds\". How often do you stay in a hotel built on a wharf, surrounded by gorgeous pleasure boats with a great small city skyline?? FOOD: The breakfast was wonderful each day. Many good, healthy choices and lots of sunny places to sit, both inside and out. The hotel is in an area where you have to walk just a bit, but there are many great spots for food. We had a delightful evening in Max and Dylan's City Square (the original is near the theatre district in the city). It's newer, sleek, and serves great food with attentive, fun staff. They accommodated a party of six LATE on a Sunday night. We closed the place down but were never rushed or made to feel we needed to leave. This is the closest restaurant to the hotel (less than one block) and we really enjoyed it. PARKING: What do you expect from a hotel in any city? $30+ is a bargain in NYC and is on par with Philly and DC. We enjoyed peace of mind so it was worth the $$. DOG OWNERS: We regret not bringing our dog. There is a fabulous dog park (looks like a dog Mecca each morning and dinnertime!) just under the Charlestown Bridge from the hotel.

They were very good about changing us to another room right away and calling to check if the new room was alright. But, if there were other empty rooms why would they put us in that room? Also, as we were walking to our new room I saw the housekeeper with the little green fogger spraying another room with the same offensive odor. The rooms are small, we had a one bedroom suite and it was small and as others have said you could not walk around the bed once it was open. The decor and furniture is dated and could use an upgrade. The walls are very thin and you can hear everything at night when it is quite. My son had a hard time sleeping due to the noise from the other room. We were not in a harbor view room so we faced the highway side which was noisy at times. The air system in the room was loud so we left that on and it drowned out quite a bit of the noise.

The FREE morning breakfast was always yummy, with your choice of waffles you made fresh yourself, yogurt, toast, bagels, muffins, fruit, eggs, meat, cereal (both hot and cold), juice, and coffee. Also, during the week, they have either free food or reception. The hotel is across the Charles River from downtown Boston, but is easily walked in 10-15 minutes. It's also a five-ten minute walk to the Water Taxi that takes you to the Aquarium (and sites nearby, as well as a Metro stop). When you are downtown, you can easily either walk or take a subway to the Aquarium stop. If you're going to be in town for more than a couple days, be sure to buy the 7-day Link Pass ($15). It's good for unlimited travel on the bus, subway, and the water taxi (without a pass, it would have been $3.50 from the airport to the hotel, individual rides on the bus or subway are $2 each and the Water Taxi is $1.70 per ride, so you can see it's a great deal!). We purchased ours at the airport and used it to get into town (we took the Silver Airport bus inbound to the South Station, then caught the Red line to Downtown Crossing, walked upstairs, then around the corner to Franklin and Washington Streets, and caught the #93 bus that dropped us off at Chelsea and Warren Streets, a block and a half from the hotel.) There's supposedly a faster way to get there (using the Blue subway, but since we weren't yet acquainted with their subway system and this was the route suggested to us, we opted for it and it worked great!) We found the Link Pass to be a time saver (as well as keeping us from overtiring ourselves hiking everywhere), as it was easy to hop on a subway or bus to get between places that were quite a walk. And it was great taking the Water Taxi at the end of the day, as it was a calm, quiet, and serene way to end our day of sightseeing and it dropped us off a few blocks from the hotel.

This is the 2nd year in a row we've stayed in this location. We usually spend 1-2 nights in the Boston &/or Cambridge area en route to visit family in N. MA. I really do enjoy this location. Last year we spent a day touring the USS Constitution, climbed the Bunker Hill Memorial (its closed now for maintenance,) took the ferry to Fanueil Hall for dinner & went on the creepily fun Ghosts & Graveyard Tour. This year we spent the morning in Harvard Square over in Cambridge, came back & had lunch with the rest of our family, only a minute walk from the hotel in a very nice place mentioned in a previous review. We then took the ferry to Long Wharf, bought tickets for a tour of Fenway Park (highly recommended) then took the \"T\" to Fenway. Afterwards, we took the kids to \"Tomb\" near Fenway (they had a blast), then back to Fanueil Hall for dinner. Since the ferry service ends around 8 PM weeknites, we took cabs back to the hotel (less than $10.) The 1st evening, the front desk suggested 99's for dinner, a cheap, but good comfort food family restaurant (perfect after our long drive up from NJ for a light bite & fussy kids.) You do need a car to get here. Otherwise, they're several nice places in walking distance. If you drink, the mixed drinks looked generous & delicious. If you miss the hotel's breakfast buffet offering an array of hot/cold selections, there's a bakery/sandwich shop around the corner. BTW, don't miss Emack & Bollio's for ice cream, a great New England ice cream chain. I like being in this safe & picturesque area, you're definitely out of the hustle & bustle, and I found the room rates to be a lot cheaper than other locations in Boston. We stayed in a 1-bedroom suite. My big complaint for this room, when the sleeper sofa is open, its impossible to sit at the desk or even to get from one side of the bed to the other which you need to do to make it up with linens. The desk or sofa needs to be re-positioned. We found the front desk people to be entirely helpful, giving directions, calling tour companies for more information, suggesting restaurants, etc. We parked our car at the Residence Inn, never had an issue about getting it when we needed it, the rest of our family party, used the $20/day public parking. They opted for the studio room, it was close quarters for 3 adults, but since they only stayed 1 evening and we were out for most of the time, it was ok, but the 1 bedroom, is a much better deal for only a few bucks more. Again, if you want to feel in the thick of things, stay in the Copley Plaza area...but if you want a calmer experience & don't mind a ferry ride, walking or taking cabs, this is a great location.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, CA", "Title": "\u201cA Mixed Bag\u201d", "Author": "LMK5", "ReviewID": "UR76960663", "Content": "I would first say that unless you really need the larger rooms that a Residence Inn offers, you're better off staying in any one of the fine hotels more centrally-located in Boston. One of the issues with this hotel, as I was aware of before my stay, is that it is off to the north in Charlestown. The problem is that if you want to have the pulse of the city at your doorstep, you won't get that here. If you should want to return to the hotel to freshen up after a day of touring, then want to head out into the city at night, you have to retrace your steps once again across the Charlestown Bridge and make your way to what part of the town you want to visit. In a more central location you'd be able to possibly head in a completely different direction right outside your hotel and more efiiciently use your time and energy. Another issue with this hotel is the price. I paid more here than any hotel I've ever stayed in, including a 2-bedroom hotel room in Midtown Manhattan. At this Residence Inn, I had to swallow the steep $369.00/night cost (AAA rate!) for the 2 bedroom suite because it's nearly impossible to find accommodations for larger groups in the heart of the city (I have a family of 5). Even booking this room wasn't easy. In and around Boston, Residence Inn will not allow the 2 bedroom suites to come up on their website unless you book for one week. I realized this by pure chance, and had to \"game\" the system by first reserving for a week, then shortening my stay to my requirement of 4 nights using the website's reservation system to modify my reservation. Even calling Residence Inn directly wouldn't allow me to book the room for 4 nights. I've never seen this artificial restriction before at this or any other chain. As for the positives, the hotel is located on a neat little wharf where many big yachts are docked. You can walk over to the USS Constitution with ease, and there's this great little restaurant called Max and Dylan's very close by. Of course you also get the free breakfast, an indoor pool, and a location that is quieter than what you would get in the heart of the city. North Station is a 10 minute walk away. In essence, you've got to decide what you really need from your stay. If you want to be in the thick of the great city of Boston, pass this one up. If you need a larger room, a free breakfast, and don't mine reaching deep into the wallet for these benefits, then this property would be a candidate. With benefit of hindsight, another viable option for families would be to stay outside the city in Burlington, Dedham, Waltham, or other areas, pay far less for the room, then simply drive in to the city and pay $25-$35 for parking for the day.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City area", "Title": "\u201cHated it\u201d", "Author": "jwbiv", "ReviewID": "UR76352480", "Content": "First of all, this hotel is NOT in Boston...it is across a long bridge, or weird pedestrian connection, from Boston.

Our room overlooked the harbor with a boat dock and Boston. During the day, the boats were peaceful and at night, the Boston skyline looked wonderful. Yes, we could even see the Old North Church spire from our window. Breakfast was delicious...eggs, sausage, waffles, croissants, biscuits, etc. And the usual continental spread too. We left stuffed and could put off lunch even after walking all morning. The staff was really on the ball too. We had a kitchen in the room and its convenient...except we had no baking sheet. So it was hard to reheat food (I have 3 little boys). So I called down and they claimed they had no baking sheets in the whole hotel. huh. So someone brought up 1 sheet of aluminum foil. I found it hilarious that they wouldn't trust us with the roll! While on the Freedom Trail, there aren't a huge number of restaurants close.

During the day we could watch the activity of the neighboring marina, the boats sailing on the harbor, and the planes taking off and landing at Logan Airport in the distance. But shortly after sunset, the hotel would turn on some VERY bright floodlights that were pointed right up at our windows to illuminate the building.

If you walk through the shipyard, you can get the boat taxi to the Aquarium which is right beside Faneuil Hall/Quincy Market.(about $1.90 pp and kids are free). As mentioned on the site, if you turn left coming out of the hotel and walk through the little park (which has a lovely quiet playground for the kids) and over the water bridges, you reach North Station (Under big sign for D Garden). You can get subway pretty much anywhere from here. We found all the subway stations fully accessible as we were travelling with double stroller, just look for the wheelchair sign for lifts. Kids free on the subway. We would walk over the Charles River Bridge and that would take you straight down to the North End, lots of great Italians. Beside the hotel is a lovely restaurant which is great for kids, Max & Dylan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. There is also a great ice cream shop and Sorrels coffee shop. We had fantastic time in Boston.

The valet parking was not able to handle all the cars at once, and to keep from getting a ticket for blocking the road we had to use the parking next door, which cost an extra $17 though we were in there only 20 minutes. Better than a ticket from the meter maid. Sunday am we called for our car, waited in the room until we saw it out front, then came down- and they had reparked it. Hmph. The one person who was helpful - or tried to be- Friday night sent us (party of 10) to one high end restaurant which was closed for a private party (Kennedy wake?). Then he sent us to another far lower scale one, which turned out to be only a bar over the water, with high open stairs to climb for a gramps with replaced hips and little kids.

So we went to the Marriott's Sports Bar (in Cambridge), which we knew of through the school. Used reviews for other meals. Speaking of the location, this hotel is impossible to find, even with the hotel on the phone to guide you. Lots of one way streets that are unmarked, dark, etc. Lost every day but the last, when we were leaving. One bright spot is that there is a dog park just under the bridge, and a little kids play ground beside that. Lots of gang tags though.

Fireworks went off Sunday night/Mon am at 12:30 am, after the ball game I guess, probably from the neighboring park area, but scared the heck out of us. With the windows open, it sounded like artillery fire, and you could smell the acrid smoke on the wind.

It had a K bed in the bedroom where the bathroom and closet were also located. The paint and counters were clean and fairly new. No issues at all. The tub/shower handle would come off everytime we turned it and was never fixed or attended to while we were there. The furniture and cabinets in our room (700) were very worn and beat up looking. We had 3 windows in our unit. So we had lovely views of Charlestown and the water. The \"living room\" area was small, when the sofa bed folded out you could not walk from one end to the other. The sofa bed itself was missing 4 of 7 springs making it impossible to sleep on. We requested another room or even a rollaway but were told no rooms were available and there weren't any rollaways Friday or Sat, night. Nor Sunday night even though they weren't sold out at this point. We threw the mattress on the floor and pretended to camp. It's ok for a child and we survived, though when checking out and mentioned it again.... the desk acted as it that was the first they had heard of it....No real resolution. The breakfast was top notch for being included in the room price. Short of made to order eggs that would take long there was a great variety. Fresh fruit, oatmeal with toppings, make your own waffles, bagels, scrambled eggs, yogurt, donuts, cereal, tortillas for breakfast burritos, coffee, juices, and even the \"sodas\" were available for those who like their caffeine cold. The staff was extremely cordial and would bus your plates before you had time to put your napkin down. We would eat a very hearty breakfast and then go for an early dinner, to avoid crowds and we just weren't that hungry a few hours after the big breakfast. Wi fi was free and there is an area for you to print out your boarding passes etc for no charge, which was pleasant. We were able to check emails and google museum times etc with our laptop in our room.. We enjoyed the jacuzzi and there were always fresh pool towels available. The elevator and doors on the front side of the hotel are key access. As for parking, it's pay. Or find a spot behind the hotel or down in the park area. (not a lot of them but you could get lucky) The rates did change over the weekend. $38 on Saturday and $32 on Sunday. So if you are going to park make sure you get the cheapest rate for all your days. The location is a question. In bad weather it would not be my first choice. In nice weather it was fine. It was a 7-9 minute walk for us through the canal/locks and Paul Revere park to the North Station where we could catch the metro or T. It's a 10 minute walk or so to the North End which is a great place. The Constitution is about 5 minutes away and a great place to go. There is a bus if you are comfortable with the bus system. The 93 is right across the street and is with a covered station kiosk and will take you pretty much downtown. And the 92 is just a tad farther and it also goes downtown. We ended up just walking as the weather was spectacular and we enjoyed watching the boats go through the locks as we walked to the N. Station. (Green and Orange lines and commuter rail is here).

When we checked in the desk clerk was very helpful and gave lots of suggestions as to where I should take my nine year old daughter and where we should eat. Although the location is a little removed from downtown, it is wonderful for exploring the Constitution, the Naval Yard, and Bunker HIll. It was a short walk over the Charlestown Bridge to the North End, where we loved Regina's Pizza (one of the clerk's suggestions.) The restaurant was well worth the forty-five minute wait.

This is technically Charlestown but it's so close to big Boston attractions you would hardly even be able to tell the difference. We paid for overnight parking at the Riverside T station since it was much cheaper than the hotel rate, took the T to North Station and then did the .7 mile walk to the hotel from there. POSITIVES: For being practically in the city, you get a lot for your space. Here the rooms are \"suites\". They come with a living room, and a reasonably furnished mini-kitchen with a full-size fridge, microwave, stove, plates, cups, bowls, and utensils. The table in the kitchenette had a complimentary basket filled with coffee, tea, and even a bag of microwaveable popcorn. The bathroom was clean. We really took advantage of the adjustable heater near the floor in it, it worked out great for letting us dry our wet shoes from the winter snow. My favorite part of the shower was that the shower head was adjustable so that you could change it from a regular spray to a pulsating one if you'd like and it really took little to no time at all for the water to heat up. For being right next to a major bridge, it wasn't noisy at all during the night. The complimentary breakfast was nice. It was buffet style and offered alot of variety: cold cereal, oatmeal, pancakes, french toast, scrambled eggs, sausage, breakfast potatoes, juice, coffee, tea, hot cocoa, mixed fruit, bananas, oranges, yogurt, english muffins, bagels, muffins, and they even had a belgian waffle machine out with cups of regular or fruit mix so you could make your own. Even after breakfast was done, we noticed that the coffee machines are left out and we were easily able to grab a complimentary coffee/tea to go. Staff was very friendly, and helpful. Our room was missing the \"No Service\" sign and once bringing this up to the front desk, the issue was resolved in a matter of minutes. The distance to the TD Banknorth Garden, USS Constitution and Bunker Hill Monument are unbeatable. Both are easily within a 5 minute walk from the hotel, and less than 1/3 mile. A Store24 convenience store is literally, a 3 minute walk away (it's on the corner of 1st Ave and 6th St) . It's just inside the Navy Base for the USS Constitution. We felt like we were trespassing on federal property when we were trying to find it just before midnight. It has a lot of stuff in there for reasonable prices--even though it's a convenience store. We wish we knew this before checking out the hotel's mini-market and were thrilled to find Hot Pockets and Friendly's sundae's to go. In comparison, this is by far a much better deal for the money if you get the need for a midnight snack. Bear in mind though, since it is on a Navy Base, it is not open 24hrs. It was only open 6am-midnight. NEGATIVES: We paid the extra for the room with the \"Harbor view\" and ended up in Suite #524. My boyfriend and I agreed that we would not pay the extra for the view again, as it was not what we expected-- it was more like a bridge view looking at the TD Banknorth Garden than anything else (see my photos). We actually left the room in the cold of the winter night and went along the pathway to the docks outside the hotel to enjoy the view better and take pictures from there. The decorative rounded pillow on the bed had a gross stain on it--but hey, who really uses those to sleep on anyway?? I didn't really think this was a big deal, but nevertheless I'm noting it. The bathroom sink, wasn't inside the bathroom. This was annoying when one of us would get up in the night to use the bathroom and then wash our hands because the sound of the sink would wake the other one up. The whirlpool in the pool area needs some more jets, none of them really seem to hit in the right areas, and the seating bench in it should be lower. It needed at least 2 inches more of water because the top row of bubbler jets weren't covered and just spraying air at us. The temperature should have been warmer too. It wasn't terrible by any means, but could use some improvement. The vending machines, are not vending machines at all. It's the hotels mini-market. My boyfriend was starved and looking for a midnight snack so we checked it out. $1 for a candy bar and $4 for a B&J Half-Baked icecream bar---the worst part? The icecream bar not only smelt like cardboard, but it kinda tasted like it too. We couldn't find a date on it and we're really curious as to how long it had been sitting in there for. If you're in the mood for a midnight snack, definitely put some clothes on and take the 3 minute stroll to the Store24 right inside the Navy base-it's worth the walk. OVERALL TIPS: Especially to those who are considering staying here and don't mind the walk: 1) If you're getting here via North Station and then walking to the hotel, make sure you cross N Washington Street PRIOR to crossing over the Charlestown bridge because you want to be on the right side of it as you go over it. It's next to impossible to cross at the intersection once you're over the bridge. The intersection once you are over the bridge is not pedestrian friendly at all. 2) As you're walking to the hotel, once you turn onto Chelsea street/City Square, you'll see this big archway on your right, go through it and take the stairs down on the left side and at the bottom of the stairs on your right is the Inn. This will save you the extra walking from going to Warren St, to Water St, to Constitution Rd to get to the hotel. 3) As I've mentioned before... for late night snacking, definitely go to the Store24 and not the hotel mini-market.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rockville Centre, New York", "Title": "\u201cGood Christmas Holiday at the Residence\u201d", "Author": "Landwlkr", "ReviewID": "UR23322698", "Content": "My Mom and I chose to stay at this hotel because of it's location to Charlestown (where we have family) and because we could each have our own bedroom.

I was greeted warmly on arrival and all my special requests had been met. Our room was clean, comfortable and quite spacious. We had a full kitchen with oven, fridge, microwave. Some limited utensils, a pot, pan and coffeemaker. We brought food and extra gadgets we might need. Both rooms have their own full bath. NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: the beds weren't the most comfortable I have ever slept in, that's for sure. The TVs could use a little update. It would be nice if the clock radio's also had Ipod adapters, but that might be asking a bit much. The gym area is OK, 2 or 3 treadmills, an elyptical, and a stationary bike facing out towards the harbor (but bring sunglasses in the morning so you don't get blinded). Breakfast was what you would expect... some scrambled eggs, pancakes, french toast, bagels, coffee, juice, yogurt, fruit and cereal. Buffet style. All in all, it was a good vacation, Mom and I were glad for the extra space and the nice view of Boston harbor. The location isn't ideal for most, but we wanted to be in Charlestown. Side tip: there are free parking spaces next to the hotel by the bridge. They don't advertise them, and there are only about 20 or so-- so the lot does fill out.

This is a newer property near the Charlestown Navy Yard, along Boston Harbor and the entrance to the Charles River, but right up against the old Charlestown Bridge. This means that half the suites face the bridge and have virtually no view, while the other half has a very pleasant view. Fortunately, I had an upper-floor room with the harbor view during my stay. The facility and suites were very safe and secure, and the property is in a safe part of the city. If you drive, free parking is exceedingly limited, so in all likelihood, you will find yourself utilizing the valet service. For those who choose to walk and/or utilize transit, the facility is within easy walking distance to Bunker Hill and is practically within a few minute-walk from the USS Constitution. It is a 10-minute walk across the river to the TD Banknorth Garden - which also houses the closest transit station - and the historic North End neighborhood. Taxis are frequently queued outside the property, so for those not inclined to walk, access to the rest of the city is easy. The weak points are that - while there are some good full-service restaurants in the neighborhood - quick-service restaurants were non-existent. There was a servicable - albeit unspectacular - grocery store that was also about a 10-minute walk from the hotel. Overall cleanliness of the property was very good to excellent. The suite was somewhat small, but as a solo traveler, it was spacious enough, and was comfortable. The suite was clean, and all was in good working order. If something did happen to break or otherwise go wrong, maintenance services were responsive and made things right in short order. The bed was very comfortable. The kitchenette was fine, although a bit impractical to do anything more than microwave cooking. The suites were quiet, so external disturbances were minimal. From time to time, hot water in the suite could be hard to come by. But usually that was in the morning during the time that they were making their breakfast and when those guests heading to work were likely to be up and getting ready for the day. Laundry services were plentiful, albeit a bit expensive. There was a free breakfast service served seven days a week, which offered a good variety of food and was generally satisfying. On Mondays through Thursdays from 5pm to 6:30pm, they served a free hospitality snack and/or beverage, which often times was hearty enough to be an evening meal. The facility did have a cafe, which in the warmer months had the bulk of its seating outside on the pier, that was decent. In the summer months, the hotel also offered free movies that were shown on the pier. The front desk staff was overall very pleasant and responsive to all guest requests. They were also very knowledgable about the area, and the best options to access them. The housekeeping was also very pleasant, and even the property managers were pretty cordial and responsive. Overall, I had a very good lodging experience at this property. I did have colleagues who worked with me at various times during my tenure there who had different experiences with suite quality and such, but I cannot speak to those individual opinions.

Get a high floor room if you can. We aksed for a waterview but they were booked up. The room was clean and was big enough for us. I would think anymore than two people would be too cramped. The front desk was more than helpful and accomodating. They even printed out my boarding passes for me since I forgot. Bunker hill was a short walk from the Inn and beautiful. Breeder's Hill, the climb of 294 steps was worth it and the walk around the neighborhoods was great. We walked to the north end right over the bridge and ate Pizza Reggina(cash only) and a great atmosphere. We got to the Inn on Thursday, Friday went to concert in the evening and we really hustled to see everything. We accomplished quite a bit and my legs feel it for sure. When we have more time we will go back to Boston. It has a wonderful feel to the city with so much history and beauty. Cons: Granted it's not a hotel they could have had a better selection of late night room service. Room service ends at 9:30 p.m. The parking is a risk. Pro's: Great location. Good service. free breakfast with plenty to chose from.

It's a 10 minute walk to the T, right outside the North End (Little Italy). I stayed with 5 other women for a long girls weekend. We were accommadated with an early check in, the front desk was extremely helpful. They offered help even when we didn't ask. They called Duck Tours and booked tickets for us at the last minute and had the tickets faxed to us. We had requested adjoining rooms, but no rooms there are attached. We just had rooms next to each other. The rooms were clean, bright and cheerful and pretty comfortable. The couch was a little \"industrial\", but no big deal. The shower was wonderful, nice and big and a great showerhead. Beds were very nice also. The only thing wrong about the rooms were that we were on the 2nd floor and our view was the side of the bridge-the one with the Freedom Trail across it. Other than that -the rooms were great. The breakfast you get with the room was better than some you pay for in restaurants. The selection of food was tremendous, always hot and always plenty of it. Coffee was good too. You could make a plate and bring it to your room if there wasn't enough seating. The lobby basically held the buffet which seemed a little odd-but as I said-if you couldn't get a table or you felt funny eating out in the open-go back to your room. The cafe was open for lunch and dinner-same set-up-in the lobby. Food is simple-sandwiches, salads, nothing special. With all the great choices just outside your door-go to the breakfast but forget about anything else. They do have a tiny \"store\" in the lobby for candy, beverages, frozen food and ice cream. A nice touch if you really need it. Dollar for dollar the suite was well worth the price and the breakfast included made it even better. We never made it to the complimentary dinner-not sure what that was all about, but I heard the front desk staff telling people about it. The pier was nice and when the weather was warmer and all the tables were outside I'm sure it was very pretty. The airport is only 3 miles away, a great plus. The staff made sure we got a taxi van that fit 5 people instead of two taxis that would cost much more. I can't say enough about them-the front desk staff-my brother broke his glasses and they found some crazy glue for him.

We didn't eat in the hotel - Boston has some great eating places and we didn't think this would be one of them.

I debated between taking this hotel and another Residence Inn in Cambridge but ultimately decided on this one. The location was great because it was within a 10 minute-walk to the North Station metro stop or the water ferry that was also part of the public transportation system (BIG HINT: at the airport buy the weekly pass that gives you unlimited rides, then take the Metro line to the Aquarium, and from there take the water ferry to Charlestown. More interesting than a cab anyday.) The hotel is just off the Freedom Trail, and is walking distance to good restaurants, a supermarket (but it looks a little run down, especially if you are used to the Publix Supermarkets here in Florida), and a small branch of the public library with free internet. It is beside an office park and condos --- not in a typical touristy area but that works for some folks! Don't bother eating at its restaurant because you can get better food at the same price (North End Italian and Todd English's restaurants are walking distance), although the buffet breakfast is okay (comes with the room). The rooms come with a full-size fridge, a cooktop, and a microwave so you can always heat up any leftovers. We had a king-sized bed and a sleeper sofa; comfortable for a couple and a pre-teen but probably cramped if you had 2 kids or an older child. The swimming pool was tiiinnny --- but then who comes to Boston to swim when you're from Florida? We had problems with our shower but the maintenance guy came and fixed it right away. When you ask for your room see if you can get a higher floor facing AWAY from the bridge, so you get a view of the water and don't have to deal with road noise. I wouldn't mind staying here again but would like to suggest that their reception staff get to know the area so that they can give clear, concise directions to guests.

The view from the master bedroom was wonderful! We looked out at the water and at night we could see the Boston skyline beautifully illuminated. From the living room we also had a water view and could see the masts of the Constitution. We stayed at the Inn for a week and we would agree with other reviewer's comments about the breakfast buffet becoming uninteresting after a few mornings. Even though it lacked variety, it was a perfectly adequate buffet. The location was good for visiting Bunker Hill, the Constitution and for taking the water ferry to the Aquarium and the areas of the Freedom Trail near Long Wharf. In order to go to a game or a tour at Fenway Park, you should plan to leave adequate time to cross the bridge and walk to the \"T\". We recommend dinner on the roof deck at the Tavern on the Water Restaurant (1/2 mile from the Inn) for both the seafood and the water views. We also recommend the Cape Anne Whale Watching tours out of Gloucester rather than the tours out of Boston. We hung out with the humpbacks for an amazing and magical hour and a half!

We were lucky enough to get a room at the end of the hallway with great views of the water, boats, bridges and Boston skyline. Wonderful sunrise/sunset views and, surprise, a window that opened to let in some of the fresh air. The food at the hotel cafe is great and there are several wonderful restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel as well. I recommend the Warren Tavern and, if you're interested in watching Patriots football, the Ironside Grille. Otherwise, a mere 15-20 minute leisurely stroll over the bridge gets you into downtown Boston where restaurants and shopping abound! (Note though that, for some portion of the bridge, you're walking only on steel grates over the river. That is, don't look down!) The hotel was quiet and pleasant. We had drinks in the lounge every evening on comfortable chairs next to the fireplace. The bartender and waitresses were efficient and friendly. We liked having the option of having the room cleaned daily or not. On the days the maids cleaned, everything was vacuumed, scrubbed and spotless. They even ran the dishwasher and cleaned the microwave while we were out. I can't say enough good things about this hotel.
