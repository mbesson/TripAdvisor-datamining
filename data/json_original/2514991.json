Day one was uneventful, although I agree with a previous reviewer that this property could use an upgrade. Nothing special. Surprising, in fact, due to the good Trip Advisor reviews. At about 11:30 p.m. the second night, we were abruptly awakened by a screaming fire alarm. Somehow the ceiling fire sprinkler went off in a guest room two doors down from our room and across the hall. Water came streaming out of the room and before long, two fire department trucks arrived. By the time the water was cut off, it had streamed down the hall to our room's door. We hurriedly packed the van, sloshed down the hall to check out, and met \"George\" behind the counter. I asked for a refund for the two remaining nights and for check-out documentation. He asked if would like to be moved to a room on the second floor. When I declined, he replied that I would have to contact Hotels.com for a refund, and further, they didn't give check out documentation in this case. After I got home, I called Hotel's.com and have received no satisfactory service from them or Country Inn and Suites Champaign-North. I called Hotels.com and when they failed to work out a compromise, I called \"Penny\" the manager of the property. So I ask you? You are aakened by a fire alarm, two fire trucks, and ambulance, workmen trying to stop water from flooding your room, the smell stinks and I should not be able to check out early for a refund? (By the way, my reservation was not an advance, no changes reservation!) Some service! For those interested, Wingate, right next door, was so much nicer in facilities and staff for the same price. Unfortunately, unless I can win an appeal with my Discover Card, I guess consumer satisfaction is not the paradigm with either Country Inns and Suites or Hotels.com", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay & service\u201d", "Author": "Dick K", "ReviewID": "UR122298396", "Content": "We wish to express our gratitude to Bryan, the manager over Christmas weekend, for the outstanding service we received.

In fact, so many people were enjoying the pool during our Friday night stay that they ran out of pool towels. The staff was quite accommodating, however, and gave us extra regular bath towels to use instead. Some reviews had mentioned the noisy ac. For us it was just right - enough noise to give us \"white noise\" in order to sleep and an ac which stayed on all night instead of going on and off. Speaking of noise, we were right across from the busy pool, but once we closed our door, we never heard a sound. Must have great noise-reduction insulation in the walls. As if all these thing were not great enough, breakfast this morning impressed me the most. Rarely does one get to eat breakfast at a hotel on real, solid dishes with real, heavy silverware. What a treat! By the way, they also have a later checkout time than most hotels: officially 12 noon, but 1pm was fine we were told.

I would think most people would expect an included hot breakfast to have these things. At the very least you should have a type of egg available (sorry, hard boiled doesn't count) and either bacon, sausage or a potato.

Pros: very clean, nice decor with a lounge and fireplace complete with large flat-screen on the wall. Besides the plate of free cookies, perhaps the best feature was how quiet it was during my stay. No running down the halls, slamming doors and talking I found to be bothersome at other hotels closer to the university. Free WI-FI in the rooms. Feather pillows (nice touch). Cons: TV is a bit dated in the room and there is not a large variety of channels. Closet was a bit small (but I made do). The small refrigerator and microwave sat on the floor. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. I was looking for a quiet relaxing hotel far enough away from the \"college scene\" to get a good night sleep and I found it here.

BUT the front desk personnel were basically non-existent. When we checked in, there was no one there and no bell to ring. We waited a short time and someone showed up. A short time later, I went to the front desk and again no one was there. I waited several minutes, then went looking around for someone, ANYONE who could help me. I finally yelled \"HELLO!\" towards a open back door and the front desk lady apparently was right in the next room and I startled her. I don't expect the front desk people to just stand there waiting for a customer to show up but if they are in a back room, there needs to be a tv camera to alert them they have a customer or at the very least a bell to ring. A guest shouldn't have to stand there waiting for someone to happen upon them. Then the other gripe I have is their business center. Every hotel I've been to uses the room key to access a business center but the Country Inn and Suites chooses to make this difficult. You have to go to the front desk to get a special key and you must then return the key. This normally would not be such a big problem but then I refer back to the problem of no front desk people....you can't get a key or return a key if nobody is there. And the business center was FREEZING! The one lady who was in there trying to get some work done was wrapped in a blanket. I was just in there to print out boarding passes so just jogged in place to keep warm. But I will clarify that when the front desk people DID show up, they were very pleasant and friendly. One recommendation if you visit Champaign, print out or bring a very good map. I unfortunately booked the Country Inn and Suites thinking it was an airport hotel. Luckily I had a map because there are no signs to the airport and from the hotel it was a slow, stop and go ride and even with the map, I would doubt myself....you drive through the downtown and then find yourself on a dark road that looks like you're in the middle of nowhere and then all of a sudden you see a lighted airport sign....and that's it, you can't see the airport, just the sign.
