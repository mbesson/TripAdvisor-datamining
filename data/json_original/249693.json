Just returned from 3 nights, and our stay was exactly as described and pictured. Staff were just delightful to deal with, an absolute credit to themselves and the establishment. Enthusiastic and welcoming and always offering to help or just chat. Their warmth is what separates this place from others. Evan in particular was one of the nicest front desk guys I've met; but honestly the other 3 guys I encountered were just the same (hate to single out, but didn't catch their names!). Located in a residential part of town, so ideal if you're not keen on staying in the hustle of Hollywood, Beverly Hills or downtown. A short drive to Santa Monica. Definitely has a motel feel to it, but the rooms are spotless, neat and feel new (recently refurbished you can tell). High ceilings really do help. Bathroom has enough room to move. The only gripe here would be the lack of bench space to place toiletries on the pedastal style basin. There's not much within easy walking distance, but in LA you're likely to have a car anyway (or at least I'd recommend it). The included breakfast was super handy when often we just needed to grab something and go. Pastries, cereal, bananas and apples, oats, muffins, tea and coffee. Possibly a bit sugar-y for some, but hey it's complimentary. They also top up with bottled water in the fridge each day, really helpful when you're running out in the mornings. Free Wi-Fi was flawless and quick. Free parking too, a godsend in LA! The only other 'Con' I can think of is that being on a corner intersection, you might still hear some traffic when sleeping, but the later you sleep the less likely it is. We also copped a fair few fire trucks with sirens blaring during our stay, Asking for a rear room may help in regards to noise.

The hotel came highly recommended by locals and TA reviewers, and the pricing was very reasonable for LA. Prior to arriving, I had read all of the positive reviews and thought I knew exactly what to expect - but I was even more impressed once I began my stay. The hotel is located in the beautiful residential neighborhood of Brentwood - very safe all around, and conveniently located within short driving distance of places to eat, shops, and tourist areas such as Santa Monica. The rooms are tastefully furnished in a modern style, as pictured in the various photographs. I agree that the hotel may have been a motel in its previous existence, but the renovation has been done tastefully, preserving some of the old-style aspects with modern finishings. The rooms are clean, airy with high ceilings, and very comfortable, and perfect for my stay. The rooms and bathrooms are indeed on the smaller side (my room for example only had a shower no tub) - but I wonder if anyone would spend all day in their rooms, and so the size was not an issue for me. The continental breakfast was perfect - featuring pastries, some fruits, coffee, tea, and juice - and available until 11am every day, great for late-risers. The staff are amiable and pleasant, and fulfill the 'home away from home' feeling. Huge kudos to Evan at the front desk, who really made my stay even more special. Evan is very welcoming, and helpful, and it was wonderful to see him at the front desk every day when I went to get my breakfast! Parking can be challenging if you have a really large car, such as an Escalade or very large SUV (I have a regular-size SUV and had no issues).

In that respect the Brentwood is in a good location as it's between Santa Monica (about 15 minutes drive south-west) and Beverley Hills/Hollywood (about 30 minutes drive east). The one thing I would advise if you're going to drive in LA is AVOID THE FREEWAY. if you have GPS with you, take an alternative route and let it navigate you from there. The FREEWAY is a nightmare and is so busy it will delay you by hours. The hotel provides free parking which is ideal.

Therefore, I was shocked to receive such shabby treatment from Brentwood Inn which has received mostly good reviews. After booking a reservation by phone almost five weeks before my stay, I immediately received an email confirmation. Shortly afterwards, when I received my credit card bill I was surprised to see my card had been charged immediately for the one-night stay. Sure enough, when I went back to the email confirmation there was an attachment which was a receipt for the charge, showing a zero balance owing. Okay, that is different from the other hotels/motels I have experienced for any trip and for the week-long road trip in southern California which included Brentwood Inn. In fact, I have never been charged in advance unless the rate was a special on-line advance payment rate. (This was a phone reservation, remember?) Later, on the day of my stay, I called Brentwood Inn out of courtesy in the mid-afternoon from a nearby museum because I would not be checking in until about 6 p.m. after the museum closed. I was greeted cheerfully on the phone and told they had been trying to reach me because they had to cancel my reservation and place me in a hotel several miles away in the opposite direction of my trip! That,of course, was unacceptable, and after a very serious discussion, the refund I demanded was promised. Sure enough, when I returned home, there were two phone messages: One was left one day before I was to check in, saying, \"Please call us to confirm your reservation. We are running tight.\" The other message was left the morning of my reservation, \" We are running very tight. Please call us.\" Three business days after the cancellation my credit card was credited with the refund after Brentwood Inn used my money without interest for five weeks. What kind of baloney is this?

This seems to be the case with The Brentwood Inn, a very nice place indeed, but not for everyone. The Brentwood Inn is a very tidy little motor lodge nestled in the least likely of places - the tony Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. The only reason the Inn still sits alone in this residential area is that it was grandfathered into the zoning laws, having predated them by a number of years. The Inn has been a motor lodge since the 1940's, and therein lies its charm and some of its drawbacks. Because of said zoning, the owners are not allowed to replace the original structures, they can only improve and update them. The result is a smallish classic motor inn with modern amenities. Rooms are on the compact side, but clean white with neutral shading. Windows all have classic white wooden shutters. The original wooden peak ceiling is intact, with a skylight added. One wall is painted brick. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice flatscreen TV with plenty of channels (no in-room movies), a comfortable bed with soft pillows, and a dresser/desk combo with free, no-hassle, wireless internet (and very good connectivity, I might add). Each room is equipped with a refrigerator, coffeemaker, iron and half-sized ironing board (why oh why?? Hotel owners should be forced to try ironing anything on one of these nightmares before equipping their rooms with them). The bathroom - true to the Inn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vintage - is small but tidy, with white tiles and classic fixtures. There was no bath in my room, only a shower. One morning it took 15 minutes for the hot water to kick in, certainly not the most green-friendly of set-ups. Everyone - from the desk staff to the housekeeping - is friendly and helpful. The place is unquestionably cheery. Breakfast - cold cereal or pastries, juice and coffee - is free every morning, and you can enjoy it on their sunny little patio. Why people think The Brentwood Inn is good for families is beyond me; rooms are small and there is absolutely nothing for children to do here except watch TV. Another caveat: The Inn is adjacent to a firehouse. While I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it intrusive, you WILL hear sirens, a few every day. As for convenience, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot to be said for having your car parked right outside your room: no valet, no waiting. But to clarify those who say the Inn is convenient to everything in L.A., you should know the following: Places you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be near: The O.J. Crime Scene The 405 The Getty Center Santa Monica Santa Monica State Beach Pacific Coast Highway (Malibu) UCLA Westwood Places you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be adjacent to: Beverly Hills Culver City Places you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be nowhere near: Hollywood Dodger Stadium Universal City downtown Los Angeles Burbank Glendale Pasadena All told, I liked The Brentwood Inn, a lot, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not hesitate to return there. That said, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for everyone. If you are used to hotel amenities - room service, movies, spa, store, in-house gym, etc. - you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find them here. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re intrepid, a careful driver (the parking lot is tiny!), without children, and in search of a comfortable room in a good location, this could very well be your home away from home in Los Angeles.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cThey were the most accomodating staff and the rooms beautiful !!!\u201d", "Author": "BikerGrl28", "ReviewID": "UR35192378", "Content": "If you are thinking about visiting the L.A. area, I would HIGHLY recommend staying at the Brentwood Inn.

I'm SO glad we decided to stay at The Brentwood Inn. The office staff (Elisabeth and Evan) were friendly, courteous, helpful, and knowledgeable about the area. Our rooms were clean and exactly what we had hoped for: comfortable, elegantly designed, and well-appointed. Amenities included Aveda shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap, plus a makeup remover pad, vanity kit (cotton balls, Q-tips), and a small tube of toothpaste. The fridge had two bottles of water, and there was a coffeemaker and coffee (you could get coffee and tea anytime by the front desk). There was no bathtub, just a shower, but the water pressure was good and we never ran out of hot water. Everything seemed solidly constructed, and we never heard our neighbours. The rooms included Wifi -- we were warned upfront that Wifi is a bit unstable sometimes, but we were provided with a cable to use in case we had problems; we ended up using the cable and were able to access the Internet with no problem. For those without computers, there was also a laptop connected to the Internet for use by Brentwood visitors in the reception area. Breakfast included a selection of pastries, muffins, fruit, yogurt, instant oatmeal, milk and juice, coffee and tea. You could eat in the small sitting area in the reception area, or outside on the patio beside a lovely wall fountain. There was also a basket of chocolate-oatmeal bars on the front reception desk. If you were short on reading material, you could pick up something to read from a small selection of books in the reception area. It was a pleasant change to be able to pick up some fruit or a granola bar whenever I felt like it; I'm so used to places where you have to pay for every little thing. Though we didn't have time to use it, there was also a nice little outdoor seating area near our room, with two small tables and some chairs; the candles were lit in the evenings.

The non-smoking rooms, with air conditioning and heating that you can control, pillows that were so comfortable, I took three layers of pillow cases off to find out what they were, and clean bathrooms, with towels that truly dry (an important feature for my husband), Aveda natural soaps and shampoos, as well as grounds with mature gardenia bushes covered with flowers in the summer...and a patio near the office where you can eat outside, along with tea, muffins and juice for breakfast--all set the tone for recovery from a busy day and a good set up for another one.

Last year I had to return to LA and the staff of the Brentwood Motor Inn (COMPLETELY and incredibly tastefully redone inside and out!), and stayed at the Motor Inn for 2 days. It has been completely and tastefully redone and now the rooms inside look more like something you'd see in Conde Nast's Traveler magazine, or in a high end Hollywood Bungalow tucked away in the Hills and charging double or triple the price. The Brentwood Inn, IS a little pricey but you get what you pay for and MORE from the Brentwood Inn! They have a GREAT and constantly refilled breakfast buffet and due to my travel circumstances the staff was nice enough to let me check in at noon on a weekend AND I got BETTER than the AAA discounted rate! The staff are both solicitous and helpful for those who do not know LA's sprawling freeways and always willing to print out directions for you from their very nice office. The Wi-Fi service and BIG SCREEN TV's in each room are a welcome change from even the 32\" TV's in upscale motel rooms. My room had a 42\" LCD TV mounted above the wall which was wonderful to watch college football on while working on my laptop. The night before I checked in I stayed in a $120 a night place in Santa Monica. TOTAL NIGHTMARE. The Brentwood Inn is like a little idyllic spot where you can close the SOUND PROOFED DOORS and shut the world out for a little while. I got my ONLY good sleep in LA at the Brentwood Inn and I've stayed all over LA from the $120 a night place before to the $800 a night per room Mondrian (this was awhile ago :-), and I lived in LA for over 20 years. For the peace, the quiet, the wonderful service and the simple respite and the wonderful breakfast in the morning. They put out GOOD muffins and cereal, fresh fruit, etc. Not your cheapo standard motel buffet and everything is FRESH. My ONLY caveat might be if you have kids. Book TWO rooms adjacent to each other so the kids can have one if you want or save this place as your idyllic get away for two! Again the SAME family has run this property for over 30 years and it has been redone both tastefully and wonderfully with only the little bobble here and there. New paint, new beds, new EVERYTHING. STAY HERE before it gets booked up or found out about! They have EVERY service including fax you might need, reasonable, for LA, rates, and the Brentwood Inn is probably the MOST CONVENIENT place to stay IF you're going to be mostly in West LA. And it's the ONLY place to stay that's actually in Brentwood. The diff between staying at the Brentwood Inn, which used to be your run of the mill family owned motel, and now is something MUCH NICER and much more opulent and extravagant, is that at any chain or anyplace else on the Westside of LA you can get a decent room for around the same price (ALL of LA is expensive now I found out on my last 3 visits:-). The difference is staying at the Brentwood Motor Inn is an EXPERIENCE. One NOT to be missed. The room was NICER than my own bedroom at home and changed my mind about going out and buying an LCD TV as well!, the rooms are VERY, good sized, nice BIG bathroom with all NEW fixtures (outer molding on my bathroom window could have used some fresh white paint but it's outside after all) and the beds are firm and NEW and so are ALL the fixtures and it looks like they had a VERY GOOD interior deceorator design the theme for the rooms. Probably the NICEST most tastefully decorated rooms this side of the Mauna Kea imho. You get what you pay for and this is definitely worth it for a long weekend or even a week in LA. If you're doing the usual tourist things like Knotts Berry or Disneyland you're going to want to stay someplace closer to those areas, but if you want to be in trendy and veddy chic West LA and be approx. 5 minutes from a freeway entrance that will take you anywhere in LA, this should be your \"temporary home\". It's 100x nicer than the similiarly priced motels in the area or down in Santa Monica. STAY AWAY from some of the beachfront Santa Monica motels. They SOUND good, but you'll be hearing foot traffic until 2 am on a regular night as well as cars and the normal people screaming on a weekend in Santa Monica. I endured a night of this before checking in to the Inn and got the FIRST decent sleep I'd had since arriving in LA 3 days ago. Those sound proof doors REALLY work and you can shut the world out and then go out when you're ready. The Inn really is a little Oasis amongst the madness that is LA.

The Inn is a true reflection of it's loving owners. The owners have instilled their values of unending graciousness to the small staff, and there is not an unfriendly face on the premises. At checkin I was greeted by name, warmly welcomed with organic teas and fresh baked cookies and instructed on the best places to dine that night. along with what I should do the next morning. (including visit the local farmers market, a one block walk). Both of the owners who frequently man the reception area and the two young staff members treat the positon as a cross between a 5 star consierge service and the best tips from a true local. I don't think it is possible to make a request that the owners have not already anticipated and provided for. Due to the friendliness of the owners and staff the lobby is the central gathering place for this Inn. The lobby reflects the warmth of the management with dark hardwoodfloors, catherdral ceilings, a stone fireplace, comfortable furnishings, the LA and NewYork Times for leisure perusal, and a wireless MAC computer for visitor use. -Mornings are spent over muffins, croissants, fruit, juice, milk, coffee and teas in this lovely setting or outside on the stone patio wifh seating and a waterfall for a rather zen like atmosphere. The rooms are small but cozy with great beds, an abudndance of pillows, fabulous linens,. The wood beamed catherdral ceililngs make them feel more spacious and the lighting is very thoughtfully designed. This hotel under the guidance of it's young owners recently underwent a major renovation and more improvements are in process. While I was staying at the Brentwood new large flat screen TVs were installed for perfect bed viewing. Knowing that I was a football fan looking forward to the superbowl, the owners made sure my new TV was installed the morning of the superbowl! How much better can serviced get. I understand that new furniture was also in production and may even be in place now. Everything is neat clean and well cared for.

I appreciated the many useful mirrors and Aveda toiletries, for starters. As a woman traveling alone, I felt secure, even though I usually avoid hotels where rooms open directly onto the parking lot. The free breakfast of muffins, fruit, and coffee/tea fit the bill. The best part was eating breakfast in the small courtyard edged with a long fountain.
