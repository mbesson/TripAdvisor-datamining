But i always like to give everything a chance and make my own mind up. I was wrong to do this. I've stayed in poor places before but this was awful. The staff are lovely, pleasant and cheerful but that is all that i can say that is positive. When the front door is opened there is an awful smell that hits you. This is musty and strong. The carpets are mismatched, threadbare right through to the floor in parts and cabels run under them in parts. The walls and skirting have not seen paint in a long time. This is especially evident with the cracks that have been repaired really showing up the dirt. Of course there are cracks and areas of disrepair that have not been touched. The carpet in my bedroom was stained and the blanket on the bed was ripped and obviously very old and worn done. The cloth headboards on the beds were stained. The furniture in my bedroom did not fit and therefore a chest of drawers just sat in the middle of the already tiny space. The furniture was mismatched and badly worn resembling furniture found in second hand charity shops. The ensuit bathroom (which had been built into the room) was slightly better, obviously more modern but smelt bad and the shower dripped constantly, so much so the cleaners had to keep a towel on the floor to mop up the extra water that splashed over. There was so much stale water in the shower pipe that when having a shower the shower pan would completely fill with water. I attempted to change hotels but no where close had any room and for good reason they all looked lovely and clean and fresh. I resorted to buying Febreeze and air freshners and airing my room daily and even tho i only used this as a base to sleep in it was becoming depressing to return to each evening. The cleaners worked hard every day as my room was neat as a pin & my bathroom clean when i returned but it made no difference to the years of ingrained dirt. Please save yourself any heartache and do not book this hotel. Despite how nice it looks from the outside and how pleasant the staff are it will not change the fact this building has been seriously neglected and the bedroom i saw was horribly depressing and the whole building internally looks and smells bad. It's a real shame because the location is amazing. Don't even stay here for one night, it is not nice.

After getting stuck in London due to half a centimetre of snow we were forced to find a place to stay for the night. This hotel was not our first choice but by this time in the middle of the night we reluctantly approached the door. After waiting several minutes for somebody to appear we were finally let into the hotel. It is quite unlike any hotel I have ever been to. There is no reception. Rather, a reasonably polite man informed us that he only had one room left, that it was a twin budget room and that the cost would be \u00c2\u00a355 for the night including breakfast. At least point we should have appreciated the literal nature of his statement. To be fair to the manageress, who by this time had appeared, she did offer to show us the room prior to our commiting. Rejecting this offer was a major error on our part, for if we had seen the room we simply would have left post haste. They took our money, and rather than being shown to our room were simply told it is 'up the stairs'. We negotiated the frankly unstable staircase without any help with our luggage and unlocked room 9. At this point it is worth noting that we are not unrealistic with what we expect a budget hotel to offer; there are however certain things that should be taken as given: 1. the hotel and room are clean 2. the hotel and room are well maintained 3. the hotel and room should be bug free We entered into the room which was like walking back in time 50 years - fine if clean! The carpet was filthy, the furnature was ready to collapse, the ceiling had damp and had started to fall in on the room. In the corner there were holes and damp which I assume are the reason for the myriad of bugs, beetles and other disgusting creatures crawling over every surface in the room. All over the sink, the wardrobe, the bed, the walls, the ceiling, were large beetles scampering. At this point I decided, for my myself and by this point a very distraught fiancee, that this was not going to be conducive to an even reasonable nights sleep and so took all our luggage back downstairs and rang the front door bell eagerly waiting assistance. I explained to the man that we had entered the room to find it infested with pests, that it was unacceptable and that I demanded a full refund immediately. He went to find the manageress who seemed genuinely quite surprised and concerend, and said that we could indeed obtain the refund we sought. They then went upstairs to check the room, at which point another older man who I can only assume was the owner appeared and started to apologise profusely. He informed us that the hotel normally maintains very high standards of cleanliness, as demonstrated by the fact that their entrance had been cleared of snow! I informed him that the cleanliness of the hotel, and any staffing issues they may be currently be having were his problem and not mine, and that all I was interested in at that point was obtaining a refund. The whole (I assume family) were very polite about the ordeal and indeed gave us the refund. They insisted that they are having issues with the cleaner and that this is contrary to their usual standard, indeed their was an advert in the window for a chambermaid! So to offer something of a summary - the hotel was in a disgusting state. From a budget hotel I do not expect luxurary but I do expect it to be clean. To be fair to the management they dealt with it considerately, however I would not recommend that anyone stay here. In line with previous reviews on this site that go back to as early as 2004, the hotel seems far from being fit for purpose. I have noticed that the manageress is keen to put down any criticism of the hotel, but with so many bad reviews this seems to only make her efforts appear unjustified. The management clearly have not taken notice of reviews. The response 'we do all we can to keep the hotel clean' is not good enough. It should rather read 'we do keep the hotel clean'. This was definatly the worst hotel I have come across.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood Accomodation\u201d", "Author": "richard_taw", "ReviewID": "UR89587715", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in Limegrove Hotel, Victoria for 3 nights (just this week) Not very far from Victoria bus and train stations (plenty of shops and food).

LOCATION As I said in the title, this is the best thing about this hotel. It is located on a quiet street full of B&Bs and hotels, withing walking distance of Victoria Underground and coach station. Plenty of excellent restaurants & cafes nearby, as well as a grocery store. Felt safe when walking after dark. DECOR & ATMOSPHERE The hotel is in a need of full renovation. The carpet on the stairs is worn, the stairs themselves screak, the rooms are filled with mismatched furniture picked up God knows where. Doors are flimzy, and single-pane windows let cold air in. Folks who stay in the hotel are traveling on a budget, obviously, BUT the hotel management also does something that other hotels may not do - it lets in people from the street without reservation. And I literally mean from the street. They do it for the sake of cashflow and don't really care about the reputation of the hotel. I witnessed a gentleman who couldn't pay upfront and begged to stay until morning when he could go to Victoria to exchange his foreign currency to GBP. EN-SUITE ROOM Anyway, I had the misfortune of booking their en-suite room on the ground level. The room was located right at the entrance to the hotel, next to the hotel's telephone, pay phone, door buzzer and, of course, had a very flimzy door with zero sound attenuation. It was especially bad when someone came in around midnight or 1:00 am and was talking loudly about the room rates. I used earplugs all nights. TO MANAGEMENT: Folks, please, move the door buzzer down to your own quarters and don't let guests enjoy it in the middle of the night. Let your guests sleeeeep. The owners are going totally on the cheap by providing only one towel per room, and only one bar of soap. Nothing else. The en-suite shower was tiny and meant for people shorter than 5'10\" (180 cm) tall. The air in the shower was damp and had a bad smell about it. The carpets on the floor were dirty, and so was the bed cover. I had no choice but to trust that the bed linens were OK. A huge draft of cold air was coming in from an old window which had NO lock on it. It was cold during the night (it's November, people!) ROOM WITH SHARED BATH I then was moved to their room with shared bath on the upper floors. That room was nicer and had a modern plastic window frame installed some time ago. In its day, the frame may have been nice, but now it got out of whack, could be barely closed properly and again let some cool air in. The carpet on the floor was probably never vacuumed. At this point, I thought that perhaps the cleaning crew doesn't like to haul the vacuum cleaner up and down the stairs? There was a wash basin in the room with... ta-da!.... only cold water in it. Nice touch in the morning when you are trying to brush your teeth after having some hot coffee. I was squeamish and after seeing the carpets didn't use the shared bathroom. INTERNET Bring your own ethernet cable - there are jacks in the room and the connection supposed to be free, but management wants 10GBP deposit for using their ethernet cable. BREAKFAST It was OK. Too much fried bacon though. Do try one of the bakeries on Wilton st. nearby - they have oh so yummy stuff. RECOMMENDATIONS If you're staying in Londong for the first time, DON'T stay here as it will spoil the whole trip. If you need to sleep 1 (one) night and don't care much about the atmosphere/cleanliness, it may do. The management of this hotel really needs to realize that location is the key to developing this place. It has potential, but needs investment to develop into something worthy.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "Serrelongue", "ReviewID": "UR56524127", "Content": "I have stayed in this Hotel on a number of occasions over the past few months.

Here are the good things I can say about this place - the owners/management are relatively pleasant. The breakfast was decent enough, but nothing spectacular. The location wasn't too bad. A brisk 10 minute walk to Victoria station. The bad things are pretty extensive. Nothing horrific, as we decided to stay in it for our 5 days, though mostly because we pre-paid, and it was frankly, just more convenient than finding a new place to stay in our price range (we're students, and money is fairly tight). I won't go over what others have reviewed, but they're spot on. The place is extremely poorly maintained. Simple things like removing stains from carpeting, keeping the bathroom clean, keeping junk and objects (vacuums) out of the common passageways, are just signs to me that no one puts the effort or care that is needed to make this place passable. Little things that take minimal effort, like drilling holes to run the cable TV lines in to each room, instead of running them under the window sill causing cold air to leak in are just laziness. Another complaint I have is on the topic of appropriate conversation between guests and staff. While I appreciate friendly conversation, assuming simply because we're Americans that we support and enjoy the actions of our president and government is a bit short sighted. This gentleman who works here not only took the time to try to share his love for Bush to myself and my girlfriend one evening, he also brought the topic up immediately with my girlfriend's sister when she dropped by to meet up with us, as he realized she was also an American.

That's where we ended up staying our last night in London and now I wished we would have stayed there the entire time.", "Date": "August 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire", "Title": "\u201cNoisy, uncomfortable, dirty, depressing\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5204298", "Content": "I stayed here for one night - pretty bad really - uncomfortable and noisy. I ended up with bites all over me from what I can only assume were bed bugs. Breakfast was 1 hour late and when it finally arrived it was pretty unappealing - 1 rasher of bacon, 1 partly uncooked sausage and a soggy egg. I wouldn't recommend here - I have stayed in much nicer youth hostels for half the price.", "Date": "May 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201clumpy bed, noisy, poor service\u201d", "Author": "David_Crimmond", "ReviewID": "UR5020418", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Limegrove Hotel in March of 2006. We would not recommend this hotel. When we arrived we were required to pay for our three nights upfront and in cash. The sign on the hotel advertises \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot and cold water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We were surprised to learn that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meant literally and that the hot water is only available at certain times in the morning and evening! (Although we always managed to have a hot shower.) Our room with en suite bathroom on the top floor was cramped and in need of some renovation. The bed was very uncomfortable, lumpy and with springs. We ordered the continental breakfast for the next day which is delivered to the room between 7:30 and 8:30. Our breakfast came on time but was so unappealing that we decided not to order it the next day. We told the manager that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be disturbed the next morning and that we would like to skip the breakfast. The next day we were woken up at 7:30 by the maid entering our room without knocking and asking us if we wanted breakfast! An hour later the same maid came back with the breakfast we did not order and disturbed us once more. We complained about this yet the next day we were again woken up with a breakfast we specifically declined. The toilet in the hallway also kept us up, sounding like a rocket taking off when it was flushed. We would advise anyone wanting to be comfortable and get a little sleep to search elsewhere.", "Date": "April 30, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Limegrove Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d602781-Reviews-Limegrove_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">101 Warwick Way</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">SW1V 1QL</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "602781", "ImgURL": ""}}
