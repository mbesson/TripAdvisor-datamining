The room had no clock, no coffee or tea, and you had to pay for water (often included in Turkey because you cannot drink the tap water). The wi-fi connection was poor - I could hardly load pages to find our next hotel! They did grand us an extended check-out time, but they called the room to make sure we were leaving. I found that rude. Also, the walls were not at all soundproof.

The AC never cooled the room and I slept with a wet towel on my body on top of the dirty sheets. Staff turned Ac off in Lobby at 9 PM. We paid extra to stay at a different hotel away from the group.

It should not be called a \"hotel.\" While there's a lot of marble on the floors and countertops, that's about the only nice thing in the place. The rooms are small. The air conditioning did not work when it was 90 degrees outside. The noise from a busy highway was unbelievable. The wallpaper was peeling from the wall. The toilet didn't work. The promised wireless Internet connection was spotty at best. In other words, this is a crappy hotel and you don't want to stay here.

That's where the good part ends! I travel extensively for business and the companies I work for always book and pre-pay for the hotels.

Three days later and after many expensive transatlantic calls and emails I was still be told by both the front desk and the central reservation office that I WAS EXPECTED TO PAY AGAIN!!!!!! All this despite have had my office fax the receipt of the payment and having supplied them with the CC transaction number. They had by the way received payment nearly a week before I arrived. The room is old, no plug in the sink, the grouting between the tiles is old and brown. One wall socket is hanging off with bare wires exposed and the bedside lamp threatens to electrocute you at every touch, There is a mini bar complete with list and NO stock, if you want water .... well you just have to go and find some yourself!

The lack of ac resulted in one of the most uncomfortable nights we have ever experienced. The water pressure was great and plenty of hot water as we discovered when we tried to use the bath. Someone had permanently sealed the bath screen to the bathtub which meant that you had to get into the bath in order to reach the taps! We also discovered that the direction (bath or shower) controller had the wonderful habit of randomly changing from one to the other at the most inconvenient times. We do not know how much hotel stars cost in Turkey but if this place has four then they must be really cheap. Members of staff were sullen and unhelpful but still seemed to expect a gratuity.

This hotel is rated as 4 star, so on entering the hotel late at night, it looked clean and welcoming. I was welcomed politely and given my key to my 7th floor suite! The bell boy and i, took the lift together with bags, in what can only be described as very small tin can. To close for comfort, if you ask me. This is were the fun started! On entering the 7th floor hall, i found a grubby hall way, and hear what appeared to be people par taking in the own \"special\" home movie. The horrible fact was that there room was half way down the hall!!! My room was far enough away so wasn't so bad. So now the room. I was placed on the front of the hotel. This frontage looks on to one of the busiest roads i have ever seen. So i closed the windows to stop the noise, not much difference to be honest as the windows are as paper thin as the walls. You can here peoples telephone conversations from other rooms. The room was grubby and the bathroom was very dated, probably as dated as this hotels 4 stars, the bath towels greying with age. The bed was very soft, but the linen was well looked after and changed everyday. Don't open the mini bar $6-7 for a can of coca cola, Beer is the same and don't ask for water. There is no longer a pool in the hotel, so don't be fool by internet adverts.

Free wi-fi, and minibar's water is reasonable at 2 YTL. However, it's the story of Airport's Hotel/transportation agent that one needs to avoid if at all possible (at arrival level and only one there). They quoted this hotel at 160 euros at first. I took a next affordable hotel (Cevsan) at 130 euro (and offered a 10 back). It turned out it's not even worth a 30 euros.
