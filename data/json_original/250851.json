We chose the hotel because of its location. It was also offering a decent rate for a week's stay.The hotel is best reached by car, though there is a direct bus from Amsterdam Centraal to Purmerend that stops about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We took this bus to Amsterdam a few times.The hotel itself has a lobby (with restaurants and bars) and a long, curved two-floor wing containing all the bedrooms. Our room was right at the lobby end of the wing, meaning it was an easy walk. It would be a healthy walk for anyone stuck in the middle of the wing!Things we liked about the hotel:+ location, very convenient for what we were doing+ room was large, bed was comfortable. There was a writing desk, lots of storage, and a second door to block out noise from the hallway.+ room had a fridge.+ free wireless access+ good breakfast in the morning+ attractive locationThings we didn't like about the hotel:- the room got very hot at night. We didn't want to leave the patio doors open, because we were on the ground floor and anyone could have walked in. - they played music all night in the lobby. While we couldn't hear it in our room with the inner door shut, if you left the inner door it was quite obvious.- some of the staff working in the breakfast room were quite rude and unpleasant. One person told us repeatedly that we could not eat outside (despite it being boiling in the room). However, lots of other people kept going outside to eat. We eventually went outside anyway, where it was much cooler, and were harangued by the staff member. I eventually asked her for her name and said I would inform her manager of her behaviour. This seemed to shut her up.- you are staying at a golf hotel. Some guests are not as interested in a quiet night's sleep as others might be.Overall, our stay was fine. We'd go back, particularly because of the location.", "Date": "Aug 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR772972822", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pandoras_chocolates"}, {"Content": "Great hotel- Great Price- Great location!

Good luck if you have more than one piece of hand luggage. 2.) some rooms have lots of mosquitos in the summerI stayed at this hotel twice for business.

We appreciate that a lot of hotels in europe accommodate with single beds but felt her reaction was quite unacceptable and could have been dealt with in a better manner.Having said all that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the hotel was on a bus route so we didnt have to take our car into Amsterdam.

We intended to stay in Amsterdam and use that as a base to explore the surrounding area but were glad we chose this hotel instead as it's so peaceful. Only 25-30 minutes on the bus to Central Station, and about 10-15 minutes on bus 113 from the quaint old town of Edam, which provides bus links to many other town such as Volendam (for windmills, clog makers and cheese farms).To reach the hotel from Central Station keep walking along to the left, across several tram lines and cycle paths, till you come to the Arriva bus stops. The bus to Purmerend is no. 107 and there are 4 per hour during weekdays, fewer at weekends. They're always on time, very clean and comfortable, and the majority of drivers speak very good English. It costs 6 euros per person for a one-day bus pass (available from the tourist information office opposite Central Station and also on the buses themselves) which can be used all day in the Waterland area and to reach Central Station, but not to travel around Amsterdam itself. Don't bother buying one-way tickets as they're much more expensive. For families the 10 euro weekend ticket is a very good deal. The hotel itself lacks some of the amenities that are often associated with 4 star hotels (no pool, gym or sauna, no air conditioning) and is very much geared up for golfers, with the reception being accessed through the golf shop. There's a restaurant, breakfast room, downstairs bar (wasn't open while we were there) and internet access in the lobby.There are ice machines on both floors and an unstocked mini bar in the room which can be stocked on request. We just used it as a fridge! The rooms are really spacious and comfortable (three beds in ours with ample room for another) with the ground floor rooms having patio doors leading out to a small paved area with two wicker chairs overlooking the putting green. Lovely to sit out in the evening and watch the hares jumping around, but not so good at night as I didn't feel comfortable leaving the patio doors open as I was on my own with two children. It got unbearably hot indoors as the temperature reached 30 degrees even at night.The rooms are very well designed, as there's a door separating the bedroom from the bathroom/dressing area where the kettle  hairdryer are located, which means that the kids aren't disturbed while you have your shower/make a cup of coffee/dry your hair! Bathroom is pretty basic with sink, loo and bath with (very efficient) shower attachment. Loads of towels with extra ones in the cupboard in case you run out. There's also a safety deposit box in each room - we didn't use it but I suspect there's an extra charge.The breakfast buffet had various cereals, a selection of teas, coffee, juice, cheeses, sliced salami  ham, salad (unfortunately buzzing with flies which was off-putting), tomato, cucumber, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, little herb sausages, croissants, rolls, various breads, yoghurts, fresh fruit salad.All in all, a nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff, not particularly fancy but a good base to explore the lovely towns and villages in the Waterland region. Easy access to Amsterdam AND a peaceful night!

After two days in Amsterdam, this hotel was a brilliant place to relax after plenty of sightseeing - only half an hour from the city, but lovely to visit surrounding areas, eg. Edam, Volendam, etc. They no longer have a pool here, but as my husband and two sons play golf this was a lovely place to end our short half term trip. Although not particularly attractive from the exterior, the hotel was excellent - with very large and comfortablerooms that are spotlessly clean. We also managed to get a great deal so ended up paying much less than we did for our very small rooms in Amsterdam itself. It is brilliant for golfers, although there is not much to do if you do not play, unless you want to drive off somewhere, or just chill in the room or the public areas. One thing that particularly stood out was the food, which was absolutely fantastic. The buffet breakfast offered a wide variety of hot and cold food, but the bar food for lunch/evening meal was something else - gorgeous food and beautifully presented and served - a real treat, and a much higher standard than I would have expected.Highly recommended!A great", "Date": "Nov 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR869632773", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5",
