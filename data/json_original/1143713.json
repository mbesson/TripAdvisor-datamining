Don't expect anything more! No good views - rooms are narrow same as bathroom. Room service is good. Staff are helpful. No safe in the rooms .. If you wanna leave your valuable stuff, leave them at reception's safe. In brief, it's not recommended for honeymoon. It's good if you are looking for a low budget hotel.

It is not in the city centre but is still quite close to it and in august it was a safe place to reach, in the night as well. The breakfast was good and big and there is one internet station too.

We pay 60 EUR per room/per day (for example on the reception the price for double room was 90 EUR). See what we tink about it: 1. For sure Grand Tahir is not 3* world standart hotel but for Turkey/ISTANBUL he is OK. The Hotel is situated in Laleli neighbourhood (Leather shops area in European part of the city). The area is completely save.The hotel is clean and quiet. Basic English!!! 2. The hotel don't have parking and you can't stop in front of the hotel but there is a parking 200 m. away (take the bellboy to show you the way, don't give him more then 2-3 TRL) .The parking owner is very polite just give him the keys of the car and don't worry. The price is 16 TRL /24 h and if you stay more than 2 days you must give a deposit. They don't speak any language except Turkish (haha he know only EXCUSE ME but don't worry about that you will understand everything) 3. Internet: in the lobby, we was on 4 th floor and the signal was good. There is a password (telephone number of the hotel ) :) 4. Rooms: just a suggestion ask on the reception (or your agent) to give you a double bed room (with two separated beds) she is bigger than the double with king size bed. I post the pictures! The rooms are old but clean. You have air-condition, TV (1 Italian music channel and many Turkish), refrigerator but empty (strange for me?!?!) Hot water all the time, hair-drier, shower, towels were old but clean, opening windows. Wardrobe have only a few hangers and no shelfs. 5. Breakfast: not enough and miserably. (espresso only in STARBUCKS :) ) 6. Location: The hotel is located next to the Aksaray tram station which is connected directly to the main attractions of Istanbul (1.5 TRL per jeton, 2 stops, tram number 38 to Sultanahmet, Haghia Sophia, Topkapi Palace) It is also close to the Aksaray metro station. Enjoy of your staying!

When we arrived, first the receptionist couldn't find our booking, then we were told that the room was being renovated and we were offered a room in a hotel a few yards away. We accepted this, being evening and no time to find an alternative. The replacement was supposed to be also three star - this I doubt. It was small, without enough space for clothes so that we had to keep our clothes in our suitcases and try to manoever around these on the floor, also noisy until late in the evening even being woken at 1.30am with next room's television. Passing the Grand Tahir for the next few days, we could see no evidence of renovations - we were annoyed with ourselves for not standing our ground and insisting we get what we had paid for. We felt we had been short-changed.

The best features of the hotel were location and the lobby. Hotel is near Aksaray tramstation and walking distance (1km) from Aksaray metrostation (easily accessed from Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk Airport). Breakfast was poor and room was really small. We stayed in twin bed room and I recommend to choose double bed room, while it looked bigger. Bathroom was not 3* standard, more likely 1* (old, sewer smell came into the bathroom, showers were originals, etc.) Service was quite poor as well and it was difficult to get any smiles from staff. If you want to stay in good location and don't mind the shabby settings, I recommend.
