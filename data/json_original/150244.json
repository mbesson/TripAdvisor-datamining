I found the gentleman at the front desk at night, when we were checking-in to be very abrupt and seemed really bothered by any questions I had. I had booked this room months in advance and followed up with an email a few days before. I also phoned to confirm my reservation and the man who answered the phone seemed very grumpy. We asked to have a cot in our room for one fo our kids. (I was happy they were willing to accomodate us with that, as I did not want to get 2 rooms and split up my family) When we got up to the room, there was no cot and I had to go down to the desk and was given one (without proper bedding, ie. no pillow) to carry back to the room on my own to the 4th floor. The view out our window was of parking lots and buildings and was full of loud urban noises. The room was okay. The breakfast area by the front lobby was not bad, but the breakfast was very limited and picked over. Luckily the morning desk clerk seemed a little more friendly and told me about getting a bus to Old San Juan. Old San Juan was much more interesting and charming. It had a European flair. I would definitely recommend skipping a stay in San Juan, unless you like loud commercial noise, shopping, few trees, and little charm and go to Old San Juan instead.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "lorain,ohio", "Title": "\u201cPoor customer service\u201d", "Author": "ckay", "ReviewID": "UR127211937", "Content": "We stayed at this location 2 weeks ago for one night pre-cruise. The men that work at the front desk have attitude problems. At check-in, the employee spoke to us in a very unwelcoming manner and would not make eye contact with us.

When I asked him for directions to restaurants, he said that he wouldn't answer \"restaurant questions\" until he was done checking us in. Then he gave us incomplete directions and we had to find our way in the dark with little help. There was a different desk clerk at check-out and he wasn't much nicer. We booked directly with the hotel so I don't understand the reason for this negative interaction. On the plus side, the lobby is cute and the breakfast room is very nice. It's located several blocks to the beach.The room was clean but the building has an institutional feeling. Not at all a holiday feeling. Post-cruise we stayed at the Sheraton Old San Juan.

The main attractions are really in Old San Juan, it's probably better to stay there for a couple of days and then stay outside of San Juan, e.g. Luquillo or Fajardo for the islands, bio-bay, snorkel etc. Yes there is a bus stop that take you to Old San Juan for 75 cents but you never know when the buses are running. The first time we waited for 30 min and a taxi van offered to take all 4 of us at the stop for $2 each so we did. The second time, no such luck, we waited for 55 minutes and finally got on to a bus. I understand it is a budget hotel ($130!) but everything is really old. It shows that no one cares about the place nor have the customers in mind at all. The bathroom has a little sink, no counter space at all, no towel racks, not even a hook behind the door. The water in the shower is weak and cold. Wifi worked in our room for one day only, the rest of the time we had to sit in the lobby to get any signal.

It is situated on a quiet street just off Ashford Avenue (the main drag) and a 5 minute walk to the Lagoon and a 3 minute walk to the beach and plenty of restaurants and bars. And 1 minute from a Banco Popular ATM. Great location. We were initially given a room with a lovely view of the Lagoon (suggest you ask for this!) but with twin beds despite us specifying we wanted a double on booking.com; they turned out to have no doubles but instead gave us a room with two doubles at the same cost. Unfortunately this was on the other side of the hotel and had a grim view of the neighbouring building's wall. But it still had good light and was okay. The rooms are fine - a little dated but neat, clean, spacious enough, and with comfortable beds, as well as a little seating area with a table, wardrobe, drawers, a fridge, and suchlike. The breakfast is free and uninspiring, but fine - cereal, juice, and some pastries in a little breakfast room next to the reception. As well as enjoying the local restaurants and bars in Condado (a pleasant area with a beachy feel) paddleboarding on the Lagoon, and splashing on the beach, we walked to Santurce, which feels much less touristy and had great art museums, to Miramar, where we went to the cinema, and we caught a 15 minute bus to Old San Juan.

Needed a place to stay while attending a conference at the Ritz-Carlton after not being able to secure a room at the conference discounted rate at the Ritz (the full rate of $300 per night was too much for someone not sharing a room). At less than $100 per night and only a 4-5 mile drive from the conference, with free off street parking included, I thought this was a good deal. When I got to the hotel it was about what I expected for the price. This was an older property with no carpet in the room and the bathroom was an older style as well (with no counter by the sink) and felt like an undergraduate dormitory, but it was clean and I was not disappointed. So you're probably wondering, why did I rate the overall experience \"terrible\"? Well if you look at their website, it says \"Off-street parking is available free to guests - just leave your keys with the front desk...\" Sounds like they have a parking lot that's too small and they want to pack as many cars as they can in there, right? Wrong! There is no lot, there are only two alleys as wide as a single roadway lane, one on each side of the hotel. Cars are parked one behind the other, and they want you to leave your keys at the desk so that if someone parked ahead of you wants to leave, they can move your car out of the way. Okay, no problem, I thought, I can deal with that. I was the last car parked in one of those alleyways when I left my keys by the desk about an hour past midnight. When I went down in the morning and got the key, the car had been reparked across the street. Obviously someone had to leave earlier than I did, and the person at the front desk had found an open street parking space. But, I had scrutinized my car the night before (before driving off the rental lot) and found no damage. There was now a very noticeable scrape on the right rear door, like the car had sideswiped something! It might have been possible that a passing car did this (the street on which the hotel is located is very narrow), but the damage was on the RIGHT side of the car, and the car was parked on the RIGHT side of the street! Curiously, there are these barrel-sized cement cylinders across the street which extend fairly far beyond the curb, and the damage to the car matched the height of one of the cylinders almost exactly! The next time I saw the person who was at the front desk that night, I asked him if he knew anything about the damage to the car. He replied that since he had been off work for a couple days, he \"remembered nothing\". Uh huh. Didn't want to remember anything is more like it. So they won't admit to damaging the car and I'm stuck with having to deal with the rental agency and my insurance companies.

It is affordable compared to most places and they have parking which is great. (You just have to leave your keys at the front desk) They have a very average free breakfast with fruit and cereal and some danishes. No frills just food. The rooms are VERY plain and not high end at all but good enough if you are just going to sleep there. It even has a nice balcony. There is not too much of a view because you are in the middle of a few hotels but like I said if you plan to only sleep there it is good enough. There in NO POOL, so be aware of that, but the beach is only a two block walk. They do have a nice patio on the roof which you can take pictures and sun bathe of you want. The men in the front desk are usually nice, even if you need your car to get out of the lot they usually are willing to help. The only bad thing are the old women who work there. They all have bad attitudes. One was mopping the the front enterence when i needed to go tot he front desk and as i walked over the area where she mopped she grunted \"Ay Dios Mio!\" (Oh My God!) Not knowing that I spoke spanish. I dont have wings, I can not fly over a wet surface and I am not waiting for it to dry. Another time was when i went to get fresh towels, the man at the front desk told me you can take dirty towels and they will exchange you for clean ones. Well as I went to the place to ask for clean towels the lady tells me in a nasty tone \"Not for the beach!\" Just so they know, I can use as many towels as I want during my stay, and if i want to take it to the beach (which I wasn't) that isnt your concern. I am paying for that service. I guess they get pissed that they have to keep washing towels. I got news for you, it's your job! Those nasty comments really pissed off my stay there, but other than that, its just the most affordable chaoice to stay in Condado.", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wichita, KS", "Title": "\u201cnice, clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "benito12345678", "ReviewID": "UR7292134", "Content": "The hotel was great for a one night stay before embarking on a cruise.

The view from our balcony was nice though and we were only minutes away from the beach and many restaurants.

The rooms are big, clean but minimally decorated. Some even have views. I felt the rate I paid was fair - $98 with AAA discount for what I got. The downside is that the staff was not very friendly or helpful. When I asked for suggestions on places to visit, they had none. When my toilet didn't work on the first night they told me that they didn't know how to fix a toilet and since it was a Sunday, maintenance couldn't come till the next day. Only after really pushing did they move me to another room. It was a disappointment since the person I talked to when booking the room was so friendly. The location is great so close to Condado with its restaurants and beach. It's a little hassle to get to Old San Juan if you want to take the bus. They don't exactly run on schedule.

Until now we have found them to be bang on and I guess we were due for a let-down. The Canario was possibly the single worst room we've ever had, the list of deficiencies is long. I'll pick a sample and list a few. Our air conditioner made as much noise as an electric lawn mower, we were given a dirty dark room on the forth floor perched neatly over the sound of car alarms going off ALL night right in front of the hotel . I swear we may have only go 2 hours sleep, the barking dogs at least had the decency to call it off at 1am! There were hairs in the shower stall, on the floor and grossest of all, between the sheets when we turned the bed down! (yuk!!!) The TV was not set up to receive the satellite channels and I ended up programming it for myself. Just a few examples which shows the complete lack of interest-to-details the staff gave our room. But here's the kicker... the light in our bathroom didn't work. When I pointed this out at 2pm, I was told that there was nothing that could be done about it, and was asked why I hadn't mentioned it the day before? We had just checked in!!! The desk clerk then after being asked what I should do, after all a light in the bathroom was pretty basic, (I am not making this up!!!) handed me a flash light!!!! I am not kidding. A Flash light!!!! Even if it was $ 30.00 a night I would not ever stay there again, at $ 135.00 it was a pure insult to hoteliers everywhere. I am glad others have had favorable experiences here, we did not. Like I said, we were due I guess, we stay at \"boutique hotels all over the world and know what to expect.
