I also like that you can open the windows to get the air circulating. The buffet breakfast, which is included with some packages, is absolutely excellent. For a quicker breakfast there is a snack area which serves Starbucks. The pool is small and rather dimly lit but a really nice feature in a downtown hotel. For a downtown hotel, the price is great. Also, parking is conveniently located (across a small street but close) in a secure garage where they actually roll down a locking door late at night.

Very welcoming! Reception was very quick and prompt whenever I had a request for extra things like soap etc. (I was sharing a room with 4 students bear in mind). I also enjoyed each morning my free edition of the National Post :) no complaints here on that end. The room itself was very basic and had a very weird stench to it. The maid did do our bed every morning but she forget twice out of our 3 days to change the towels, that was not fun at all! The basic rooms you pay for aren't amazing in any way so don't expect much. The bathroom we had was very small and the curtain was pretty lousy in keeping the water out. I've seen better bathrooms in Cuba to be honest :S Also, the elevators take forever to make their way through the floors and are very small, your better off taking the stairs if you are in a rush! I never took advantage of the bar or ate any of the food there, I was always going out to eat because I figured it would be cheaper. However, I did use the gym and pool and I can vouch that both these facilities were very small for a hotel this large. I was not impressed to be honest. Then again you get what you pay for.

I really wanted to like it, but...Oh and if you are thinking of booking a room here because there is a \"lap\" pool, forget it. It's more like a wading pool.

The rooms however are very average for a 'value' city centre hotel with not a huge number of luxuries (appreciating however that Courtyard is at the lower end of the Marriott chain), however our room in all fairness was clean and reasonable comfortable. However, our room was on a lower floor overlooking Yonge street, and as a result of that there was a lot of noise during the day (however with due respect, there were roadworks being completed in the area during the time I was staying), and in addition, noise from the outside was still audible at night while trying to sleep (I have no clue if rooms on the higher floors would be as bad). The pool area was reasonable which also had a nice hot tub, in addition, there is a small computer suite in the reception area with access to the internet which was free for guests to use which was a great bonus. For me, one big disadvantage to this hotel is it is not best situated for two reasons, firstly it is a reasonable walk away from the majority of the downtown nightlife (bars . restauraunts etc) and it is also in one of the least tidy areas of the downtown area. However it is approximately a 15 minute walk from the Eaton Centre. To summarise, I would suggest this hotel is best suited to those staying on the city on business.

When in Toronto, we are being lodged at the Marriott Courtyard downtown. Ok, usually, when hotels/taxis/other services fares are negotiated by third parties, the customer is the victim. Horror stories abound, but don't apply here. Which is a great relief. From the very beginning of our contract years ago, and up until now and still going, the staff made us feel welcome. We are not given tiny closet-size room, as I don't believe exist in this hotel. The smaller ones are yet roomy, with a big enough bathroom and sometimes a balcony. Granted, sometimes the bathroom is weirdly arranged, making a midnight trip to the bathroom quite the experience, but who cares when it's clean and functional? Furniture is basic, don't expect anything too too recent, tvs are fine but the cable service sometimes has issues, but ultimately, the pros are outdoing the cons. The location is also important. It is near fast food joints, but also a walking distance from better eateries near Bloor. Shopping is also walking distance with the Eaton center nearby, there is a subway station a block away and a good movie theater. The only downside really is the disappearance of the nice and quiet bar, the Fireside, for the starbuck cafe behind which the new bar hides. Too bad because Peter, their best-by-far bartender was always a pleasure to deal with (when he's mixing, try his margarita! Just make sure HE is doing it, otherwise it'll be a plain, cardboard tasting beverage). I'm pretty sure the new cafe is fine, but I miss the atmosphere of a hotel bar, and I miss my margaritas. And I am pretty sure that Peter is bored out of his mind in his unattended sort-of bar that looks like a starbuck because it is. Please Marriott Courtyard manager, give us back a real bar!

I payed only a little over $100 for a 2 queen room and there was so much space to move around as well as a sitting area near the window. This time we were there for a halloween party, and friends of ours got ready in our room so it was nice to have so much space for everyone to get ready in. We've done this before at a more expensive hotel down the road and there was barely room to walk around the beds without brushing up against the wall. The lobby is updated and modern and there was construction starting up in the morning when we were checking out, so I'm assuming they are in the process of a makeover. The rooms themselves are nothing fancy, but very clean, and the beds are very comfortable. We never did get down to the pool and gym but based on what I saw from the pictures it would be ok for a quick dip or soak in the hot tub as long as there weren't a lot of people down there, the pool is very small and narrow. It's located about a block away from Young and Dundas, so you're right in the heart of the city. Theres all kinds of different restaurants right outside the door that are open late so you wont have to wonder far for a late night snake if you need to. There is also a shoppers drugmart next door which is very convenient. We checking in and out in and out in a matter of seconds and were well taken care of by a friendly staff the entire time.

The main porte cochere entrance to the hotel is actually off Wood St. The Yonge Street entrance is usually closed. The lobby is usually very busy, but its earth tones and modern furnishings are soothing. The check-in staff was quick, efficient and pleasant. My room, a king single, was spacious, but with a quirk. Not only was the faucet separated from the shower & toilet, it was on the other side of the room, next to the clothes closet. Irritating, but not a major gripe. The room was comfortable if fairly generic, with the typical taupe color scheme and a couple of loungers and a work desk (which unfortunately didn't face the TV). The bed was very comfy, with just the right balance of firm/soft. Elevators in the south tower, where I stayed, tended to be slow at times. The hotel featured a restaurant, pool and fitness center - none of which I sampled on a fast & fun weekend in T.O. There were computers for use free of charge in the lobby, and WiFi was free. The Courtyard is in a great spot - smack dab in the middle of downtown Toronto. The stretch of Yonge Street where it sits has a carnival midway atmosphere to it - shwarma and pizza stands, tacky souvenir and electronics shops, budget eateries, adult video stores and lots of flashing signs. It's a fun place to soak up atmosphere and people-watch. The hotel is around the corner from the College subway station and the College Street streetcar, allowing for easy use of Toronto's vast public transit network.

Both times I stayed for an extended period, just short over a week. Both times I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the accomodations and the service. First and foremost: it seems as if Marriott has tackled each and every gripe I had when I last visited the hotel. Nowadays the internet access is fast, you have easy means to print boarding passes and other stuff and the lobby has been opened up to reveal the restaurant more prominently and to highlight the newly added bar. If anything, the pool still needs a renovation, but I would be hard-pressed to find any other problems with this hotel. The remainder of this review will focus on the stay in October, 2011. I arrived quite late, but the room was not ready. The person at the check-in, Chris, was picky as to which room he would give me as I was there for an extended stay. I agreed to wait a few more hours so that he could get me in a nice and comfy room. He immediately started inquiring as to what I had planned that evening and helped figuring out ways in which he could make my evening more enjoyable. He suggested a few restaurants in the neighbourhood and I tried one of his selections. The restaurant itself was in a side street and would have been easy to miss, yet the food was more than excellent. After a few hours and after a very nice dinner I was back at the hotel and Chris was waiting for me. A few moments later and the room was all set up and I had the keys in my hand. Just as on my earlier visit, I was once again amazed at the size of the room. These rooms are huge and the beds are very comfortable. The sofa, TV, cabinets and bathroom may be a bit Spartan, but they are clean, easy to use and in good working order, so no complaints there. I slept like a baby each and every night and I am quite picky when it comes to noises and light falling into the room. The room attendants were very thoughful, the staff at the lobby was knowledgeable and very helpful and everything went as smoothly as it could have gone. Someone in my party was arriving late: no problem. She picked up the room key when she arrived and could come straight up to the room. We wanted to do some laundry: no problem. A complimentary laundromat is available and even the washing detergent was complimentary. We made a couple of phone calls fronm the room and these were neatly added to our final statement, which was slipped under the door the day we left, making check-out a breeze. Yet there was one thing that stood out. When I checked in, I mentioned to Chris at the lobby that my wife was having her birthday during our stay. I enquired whether there was anything special that they could do and he promised to look into it. And he certainly did! On the day of her birthday, we received a complimentary room service dessert along with a birthday card for my wife, signed by all the people working at the reception. Such a small gesture, yet my wife could hardly believe her eyes. I would once again like to thank Chris, as these small gestures are what makes the difference between good and great, and he certainly delivered and made things great! Such small gestures make Courtyard by Marriott a most wonderful place to visit and I am certain that I will be back. It speaks for itself that this hotel comes highly recommended. Not only is it in the middle of the fun in Toronto, the rooms prove to be wonderful time and again and the serivce and commodities have only gotten better over time!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA bit tired but some nice touches\u201d", "Author": "LPNSW", "ReviewID": "UR119535892", "Content": "The room was a bit tired, and the staff also, but this hotel is in a good position to downtown (and the University of Toronto).

The breakfast buffet was great, though, with lots of healthy choices along with the obligatorily over sugared, over salted North American fare.

We found the hotel very well located within easy reach of the main shopping area and the other tourist locations. But a word of warning. There were four in our party and we arrived shortly after 7pm so we checked in and freshened up and decided to go for dinner. After walking a short distance we went into the Hard Rock Cafe, after being seated, placing our order and then receiving our drinks I went to get my glasses out of my handbag which was at my feet, to discover that my bag had been opened and my purse taken (I knew imediately what had happened as I was aware of people sitting very close behind me and now they were gone without placing an order or being served). Both of our driving lincences and credit cards were taken along with a large sum of cash. The management were very helpful and assisted me in calling home to cancel our credit cards and call the police. Even though I had cancelled my cards within 15 mins of being stolen they had already been used in the Apple store in the Eaton Centre across from the restaurant to the value of Can$1,479. So be very careful and make use of the safety security boxes provided which lucklily we had put our passports and most of our cash in just as we left the hotel. If not we would have had nothing for the rest of our trip as this happened within an hour of landing in Toronto. Another thing to watch for is making international phone calls. I had to call Ireland to try and get copies of our driving licences so that we could still collect the car we had hired and lucklily they emailed us the documents we needed but when I asked the hotel about the cost they said we owed Can$160 for two calls to Ireland and a few local calls to the police and the Embassy. I spoke to a few managers about this and explained what had happened and apart from our circumstances I expressed my outrage at the fees as I could not see how they could justify those charges. After speaking to another manager they waived the full cost. Another footnote was when we went for breakfast the next morning across to McDonalds we had just gotten our food and sat down to eat when we were evacuated from the restaurant as there was a fire. We could not believe it as we had still not been in Toronto 24 hours and already we were robbed and evacuated because of fire. We think it was only smoke damage in the kitchen and as far as we know there was not much damage. But at this stage we thought things could only improve and indeed they did.

I heard the corner rooms were better, but we didn't get one. The view wasn't that great...hi rise condos and offices everywhere, like in NYC. The washroom facilities are tiny with a separate toilet/bathtub room and the smallest wash basin/closet area I've ever seen. They should have used some room space to give the bath facilities more room. Bed was fine although not the 'standard' Revive bedding luxury of Marriott hotels. They have a dining room and room service for dinner time only...very different from the 'normal' Courtyard. TV widescreen, but very small (32inches) for the room size. We watched a movie on it for $16...and ordered dinner room service ($65 for two) which was prompt and good. Local phone calls $1. Was a Best Western before Marriott, and before that it was the Westbury Hotel for many, many years which had the greatest piano bar in the city for years...no longer.

We had a great stay. Having stayed at several downtown Toronto hotels over the past 10 years, this one has by far the largest room for a moderately priced hotel. The location is perfect. The only place to be is on Yonge and it makes getting to underground transportation or shopping easy. Toronto is best enjoyed parking the car and not seeing it again until you leave. Our room was quite clean. The bathroom is a little small, but the sink outside the bathroom is pretty handy. We had a difference in opinion on the mattresses - I found the beds fine. I certainly had no trouble sleeping and enjoyed the pillows of various firmness. My son can sleep anywhere. My husband didn't sleep as well as he felt the mattress was worn. TV was up-to-date, the view from our window quite nice, and our room was very quiet. The air conditioning could be better - it was barely cool and we had it turned to the max. We were greeted upon arrival with quick check in, and from a clerk who located a room away from the elevators for a quieter stay. The hotel is well equipped with a convenience store, a bar, a nicely designed area for internet access, an area to print out airline boarding passes, lots of couches for comfortable seating in the lobby, and a great restaurant for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is not included, and can be pricey ($20). If you are a AAA member, check out their deal with two free breakfasts per night. The front desk was very accomodating as we were a party of three. We received vouchers we could use in any combination we wanted on any day - so for us, staying 4 days, we enjoyed the buffet breakfast three of them (just paying for one breakfast) and ate out one morning nearby. The buffet is extensive, and you'll find everything from omlets made to order, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, all kinds of cereals, rolls, danish, fruit - I'm hungry just writing about it. You'll also find a Second Cup downstairs and a Tim Hortons nearby for other breakfast options. This was the first stay at any hotel where a fire alarm went off. This happened at 4:30 in the morning. At that hour, your trying to get your head together as to what to do. Luckily their alarm system did advise with a speaker in the room to stay where we were, and then let us know that all was clear. We did learn from a flight attendant that this can happen several times a month at this location. I cannot comment further on this, except to say that the alarm system does work. We would definitely stay here again. If your a family of three or more, you'll find the room size to be what you need in this city. Service was great from the staff.

The rooms were both identical with two queens beds in each and a separate bathroom, very spacious and lovely comfortable beds also with a new large widescreen TV. No mini fridge was provided which is always a nice thing to have but most hotels are doing away with this option but the free Wireless Internet which was excellent and was available in the room via a code which is easily available from the reception desk. We had breakfast in the hotel and this was excellent with lots of space, it had the same format as all the Marriott Hotel chain, lots of choices and availability of freshly made omelettes/eggs and waffles. We got to the hotel via a taxi from Toronto airport which had a set price of 55 dollars which we thought was reasonable as the bus was only slightly cheaper for 2 people and that would have dropped us off 2 blocks away, we also went back the same way by asking the reception to get us a taxi. Did go on the subway which was very easy to use. The hotel is situated on Yonge Street and in a good location for the subway 1 block away, Eaton shopping centre a 5 minute walk away and the CN tower was about a 20/25 minute walk as well. there was also a Sightseeing bus stop point right outside the hotel on the main street which was very convienent . The hotel was surrounded by such food chains such as Second Cup, Starbucks, Tim Hortons, Wendys and McDonalds. We ate at the the Irish pub and Franks in College Street and they were very good and also value for money, also ate in Swiss Chalet and Marche which is unusual but good for the family if they all want differnet things as the choice is varied and very good. We done the Yellow Sightseeing open top bus tour which includes a boat ride/tour of the harbour/islands and its great value for money as you can use it for a few days.

Used to love this hotel but they have made some changes and to be honest, in this case, not all change is for the good. Courtyards in general have been undergoing revamps across the brand and at other places I quite like the new media pods, not that they appear to be introducing them here. I noted on the web site that they have changed check in from 3.00 p.m. to 4.00 p.m. So I sat there like a good girl with my suitcase to wait out the hour until I could check in. I noticed other people arriving and checking in and as I am an Elite Memeber thought I'd ask if I could maybe wait with a cup of tea or something. Pleasant guy, concierge maybe, then told me that provided the room was ready I could check in immediately. It was, and I was grateful, but it might have been nice to have been approached to see if I needed anything. What they have changed is the layout of the ground floor. There used to be a really nice bar/casual dining restaurant that I think was called the Fireside Lounge or something like that. From what I could see that has now been changed to a conference room and the restaurant is tacked onto the back of the area used to serve breakfast. The bar is now part of the lobby. I was traveling with my spouse but have often stayed at this hotel when traveling alone and I would certainly not feel very comfortable using the bar the way it is set up now. The lighting in the restaurant feels much more harsh and though I love people watching, it was one of the things I liked about the Fireside Lounge/bar, sitting by the window and watching people walk by, in the new location which now faces directly on to Yonge Street I felt more like a goldfish in a bowl as the passers-by looked at us. I understand the logic, if you walk past a restaurant and can see people eating, you are more likely to go in and as hotel restaurants have a harder time than most restaurants to compete for non-resident trade it makes sense to use us guests as a kind of lure, but I can't say I liked it much. The service is still good, we recognised the waiter, but the menu seems to tave taken a bit of a dive. The crab cakes are no where near as good as those served at the Marriott Eaton Centre. My main course lamb shank was excellent but my husband's steak was not really rare, more medium rare, and, sorry guys, more than a bit on the tough side. The room was OK, I've been in bedtter rooms in that particular hotel but the bedding etc. was up to the usual Marriott standards though the (few) pillows were too soft and flattened out as soon as our heads hit them. The bathroom floor had stains on it, the towels were the bare minimum and a bit on the rough side. The TV didn't work. When turned on it looked like a computer reboot from the old DOS 3.1 days. We phoned down and they sent an engineer who announced we had the wrong remote and that the TV had not been configured correctly. He gave us another remote which meant we could at least change the TV channels but never could get the TV Guide to appear nor any of the other usual menu options. The air conditioning was really noisy and struggled to keep up with the humidity but last weekend was particularly uncomfortable as there was some very severe weather approaching so let's give them the benefit of the doubt on that one. If you like to swim/use the gym then ask for a room in the South Tower so that you don't have to look like a wally walking through the lobby in drippy swimwear. If in the South Tower you just take the elevator to the ground floor and turn away from the lobby to a small flight of stairs to the basement to get to the pool. The exercise room is great, no weight scales I think but that's probably a good thing. The pool is great for laps. The hot tub is HOT! The elevator doors appear to have been put on steroids. You push the button and then struggle to check all the lights to figure out which one is going to open and you had better be really quick at figuring out which one and get in there before the doors close because believe me, it's milliseconds and whap! doors are closed and you've missed it. As is standard at Marriott's of all brands the staff are the real stars of the hotel, pleasant, polite, charming.

The website is TOTALLY MISLEADING! Let's start with the lobby that was hot as heck, so hot in fact the girl checking me in looked like she needed an ambulance, so I will not hold her less than friendly attitude against her or the line that I waited in for 25min to check in b/c there were only 2 clerks on. Than the elevator gets stuck with 6 of us and there didn't seem to be any urgency to get us out! Onto the room -- nothing like the website. Dated scratched up furniture, stained carpet, bathroom shower had a broken shower-head that sprayed all over the floor. Called down to the front desk to be advised they had no other rooms available. Really? How about the people checking in? Where are they going? And are they too getting a room that looks like this? I was there for two nights, they never fixed my shower - called about it 3X. My internet connection never got working either - never got a call back about that.

Yes, I get that it was a busy couple of days in Toronto and that's why I wound up here in the first place, but how can a hotel charging this type of rate not ramp up their staffing in advance ?

The check-in guy also gave excellent restaurant suggestions, (Donatello's on Elm Street was great) I asked for a quiet room, so i was given the top floor, and was even shown a floor diagram so i could pick my preferred location (so i could see where the elevators / ice machine was etc) I've never been given so much information and help chosing my room! There were 3 elevators, and i found them to be so quick, i hardly ever had to wait considering i was on the 17th floor. There was free wi-fi! How impressed i was with such a large, 'proper' chain hotel offering free wi-fi. Also there were 2 computers with free internet in the large reception / lounge area, as well as another 2 computers linked to a printer so people could check in online for their flights and print out boarding passes. I loved all these handy details. Also, on my last morning i'm sure i saw a free coffee / tea area in the reception / lounge that everyone was helping themselves too, i was in a rush so didn't have chance to investigate. All members of staff i dealt with were friendly and enthusiastic. The room itself was just huge, with 2 queen sized beds, a little sitting room area, and desk area. The bed was very comfortable. The a/c was incredibly effective, if a little noisy on full setting (it was 39 degree heat wave in Toronto) The bathroom was also split into 2 areas, so the bath/shower and toilet was in 1 room, then in a separate enclave area was the sink, this meant that one person could be using the toilet, whilst another was brushing their teeth or whatever, which again i thought was really handy. The location was 2 blocks from the subway, so i easily got there from the train station via the metro. It was a the top end of Downtown, so about 10 mins walk from the Eaton centre, so i thought a great location, though a little bit more eclectic and seedier than lower Downtown, a lot more dollar shops / tattoo shops / pizza takeaways etc, but i never felt uncomfortable. If you walked another 2 blocks north you got to the very upscale Yorkville area, so overall i thought the location on Yonge street was spot on. 2 stops on the tube and you were at the waterfront area.

This year I booked the hotel July 2nd-3rd for one night so that my girlfriend and I could have a nice night in the city during pride celebrations. We do not live very far from downtown but opted to get a hotel for the night so we could enjoy ourselves and stay the night rather than drive. We were getting ready to leave for the night so we could avoid line ups when the nightmare began. We were the first ones in the elevator at which point 9 other adults and one child entered. Upon the elevator doors closing the elevator malfunctioned and the doors would not re-open. We re-counted to make sure we were not above capacity and confirmed that it said 12 persons and we were not above that. None of us were larger individuals, in fact several of us were under 140lbs. We contacted lobby staff through the emergency phone and received an unhelpful response. They did not seem to care and advised that they would be working on it. 40 minutes later and several rudely responded to phone calls they had not updated us on the situation. The elevator walls were dripping cause of the heat and all of us were soaked with sweat and I know my girlfriend and I were very light headed. 45 minutes from entering the elevator we were finally advised that they would be sending in an engineer from out of town and they did not know how long it would take. In fear to be stuck in this heat trap any longer we contacted the fire department. 50 minutes after entering this trap the fire department attended and we were set free from the elevator. I had a horrible head ache and felt sick. We spoke to management \"Bruno B.\" about it who advised that it was our fault for having 11 adults and 1 child in the elevator when it said 12 persons capacity. I explained that we were therefore not at capacity at which point he became extremely rude. I also explained that I was the first person in and had no control over how many people came in after me. He advised that we shouldn't have put 12 people in since it says 12 people capacity. At this point I must admit I became very upset and told him then the elevator should say 9 or 10 people capacity. The result of this night... we were unable to go into any events cause now the line ups were too long..we were not re-funded any part of the evening..and we should have just taken a cab because it would've been cheaper and not as traumatizing.

The hotel is adequately appointed in the main spaces and, honestly, a little tired in the rooms. For the frequent business traveller looking for that little bit extra in comfort, this is a budget minded hotel and you should not expect more. On the plus side for this hotel, there is a very good gym on the lower floor of the South tower building. Equipment is modern, well kept and a decent variety. There are three treadmills and a couple of exercise bikes (all modern with TV's and a supply of earphones) and a couple of ellipticals so it can be busy in the early morning hours. There is a small area for weights and enough floor space for pushups and ab work. There are mats and more than one exercise ball. I did not use the pool or the change rooms. Staff were very friendly and accommodating, particularly at checkin. There is no shortage of taxis at the front of the hotel. Taxi to Eaton Centre was about 7 bucks and there are lots of transit options close by. Location seemed safe to walk in with lots of sidewalk activity so one never feels alone in a creepy area. Lots of local coffee shops. Location is good for some business interests in the area, but be aware there is a fire station on a very nearby corner. Downtown Toronto has a lot of fire calls and this station is no exception. Internet access, while free, was a bit of a hassle with an access code but a need to reenter the code at least daily and, in my experience, nearly every time I logged on to the net. This was variable and unpredictable. It seemed to not be linked to one's length of stay or any other sort of timing. Most frustrating was an internet crashout that required re login right in the middle of checking in on line for a crowded flight. Arrrgh. Beds are adequate but not outstanding by any means, linens are definitely on the budget side. Rooms are large enough but have a goofy arrangement of washrooms with \"water closet and shower\" on one side of the room and a sink and hair dryer on the other. This has benefits when travelling in pairs, but comes off as small and cheap looking. Bathroom linens have seen their best days and should be due for a refurb soon I think. Housekeeping was adequate but a little more attention to detail is definitely needed. My coffee pot was never washed out (not a big deal but just one of those things); on the first day of my stay a significant lack of in place linens (two towels and a face cloth in total). Fine for me as a single occupant, but would have been a call if there were two of us; it was back to normal on the next day without a request from me. Rooms are clean enough in the broad sense but they just don't feel sparkling somehow. My sink drained so slowly that it would be impossible not to notice while cleaning the sink, this should not require a guest request to be repaired. It would seem rooms should be sparkling since housekeeping trolleys were in the hallway virtually all hours of the day. The lobby has a small bar and cafe as well as the mandatory sundry shop. The food at the cafe was expensive and not great; selection was very limited. Much better to walk down to the grocery store a couple of blocks away, or hit one of the many fast food joints nearby. Hint, there is a terrific little Burrito place kitty corner from the hotel. Bar prices in the hotel lobby were 10 dollars a glass for mediocre wine and don't even think about a half litre at over 20 dollars. I did not eat in the hotel restaurant and it appeared that there was no room service but I did not try hard. Perhaps the most annoying thing is the in room air conditioner. One of those below the window jobbies with the controls on the unit (old school to be sure). It clunks and clangs and has a very loud fan. You think it's not doing much until you turn it off then you realize you must leave it on. The thing cycles on and off every 2-3 minutes: all day and all night. For best effect, the curtain above the thing had to be drawn back to allow air circulation that didn't simply go behind the sheers but you are still looking at an on off cycle every three minutes. Did I mention all night long.... I am an easy sleeper and seldom complain about sleep quality and that darn thing kept me awake virtually every night. I don't know about this hotel as a return stay, while I wasn't completely unhappy, I wasn't terribly impressed. Yet it seems busy.

While the wi-fi signal was decent, many company and government employees are required to use a wired LAN connection for reasons of security. As the buildings were already fully wired, the reasons for abandoning LAN access are hard to comprehend. Secondly there are NO IN-ROOM SAFES in this 475 room hotel. With laptop computers and the multitude of personal electronic devices travelers carry nowadays, lack of an in-room digital safe is a major drawback. Having to wait in line at the front desk to deposit and retrieve articles from the hotel safe is not an acceptable substitute. Otherwise, my room on the 14th floor South Tower was clean and comfortable. Very much standard Courtyard fare with dark green carpet and minimalist furnishings. The feeling generated is the opposite of cheerful . The view to the north overlooked the top of the shorter North Tower and was quite picturesque. Unfortunately plans are afoot to demolish the next block north on Yonge St however and construct two 58 story condominium towers, so enjoy the view while you can.

We stayed here for two nights towards the end of our honeymoon and unfortunately, this hotel fell short of the luxury were hoping for. The hotel complex and the lobby looked nice enough, however we were terribly disappointed when we opened the door to our room. It was very very basic, the bathroom was one of the smallest bathrooms we'd ever experienced, and the room was of a \"budget\" standard rather than \"luxury\". The most disappointing part of our room was the view, which for us was something we were really looking forward to. For our honeymoon we'd specifically requested a high up room so we could take in the view of the city and hopefully capture a view of the CN Tower - not so. Our supposed \"King Size Balcony with City View\" room was a view from the back of the hotel building looking onto a block of shabby apartments that shielded 95% of any city view we may have received. My wife and I just sat and were gutted. As an experienced web developer, I realised that the image of a \"King Guest Room\" on the website was/is somewhat photoshopped to make it look a lot nicer than it actually is. The website only provides one image of a King Guest Room. My advice to anyone looking to stay here is to consider the likelihood that this image may not convey exactly what you will get. For us, the selling point of the hotel was the beautiful city view that is conveyed in that image - you will only get the lovely city view if the hotel staff place you in one of the highest rooms, provided of course you are in a room that is not facing towards some shabby apartments behind the hotel! Fortunately, the staff were incredibly helpful and one of the senior staff after hearing my sheer disappointment, kindly sought to find me a room more to our liking. I was shown three alternative rooms before finding one that I was satisfied with. The room and view we were eventually given was closer to what was shown on the website, however the view was still below what we expected - our view included McDonalds! Don't get me wrong, this hotel is not bad and the staff will do what they can to ensure you are happy with your stay. If you are on a tight budget, then you'll be happy with this. But for a 'Marriott' - we expected a lot more. If you're looking for a luxury stay in the city, you may want to consider other options. My advice to the hotel would be to arrange for a broader collection of photos on the website, particularly of the rooms. After seeing four different rooms, the difference between them are a lot considering they are all meant to be similar in specification. The website needs to show the variety of rooms as they are (i.e. without photoshopped lighting effects) so at least customers know what to expect. There should be an option for customers to be informed of exactly what view they are receiving upon booking, with an option to upgrade to guarantee a clearer view of the city landscape or for a higher up room.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location - it's got it.\u201d", "Author": "abgwin", "ReviewID": "UR111451313", "Content": "If you are visiting Toronto and want to stay downtown, you have a lot of choices.

It's huge, by Courtyard standards - 17 floors. It feels like a recent remodel, but still suffers from a few problems like inadequate air conditioners and elevators that break down a little too often. But the rooms themselves are well sized, often with nice views, and you can walk to a ton of restaurants in the immediate area. And walking is your best option, since it's valet parking at $30 a night. The upside of that is that the valets are usually very quick, extremely nice and don't seem to expect tips (they always seemed surprised and grateful when I'd slip them even a twoony). That brings up to this hotel's secret weapon - their staff. Consistently pleasant, rarely anything but efficient, they really do seem to care.

The review is based on our experience as travelers requiring a wheelchair accessible room. We spent three nights at this hotel and struggled with rating it from 2 to 5 stars. To be fair, it has some very positive attributes and a few (for us) significant shortcomings. Pros: -staff are genuinely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable; -very clean; -valet parking guys were impeccable when it came to speed of service and vehicle care; -the location can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat for dining, shopping and entertainment; -did we mention the staff and location, +++ Cons: -beds (mattresses) are a bit past prime; -d\u00c3\u00a9cor beyond the lobby is dated (carpet from 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) and hallways narrow; -ice and vending machines on each floor are exposed to the hallway; -ice machines on the three floors we checked were from the same era as the carpets and make a hell of a racket; -all wheelchair accessible rooms (floor number + 10, ex. 310) are located right beside the ice machines. After spending five minutes in our accessible room beside an ice machine, we switched to a non-accessible room. Time spent in the non-accessible room was a bit of a challenge, not what we expected or paid for, but we got by and enjoyed our stay. Bottom line, if you absolutely require an accessible room and are hard of hearing, go for it, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a nice spot. If not, you may want to try another hotel in the area. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require an accessible room and aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hard of hearing, you might want to avoid rooms near the ice machines (floor number + 01; 03; 11, ex. 301;303;311).

I booked with my CAA membership card which allowed us a lower rate as well as buffet breakfast for two the next morning. First of all when booking the room I called the 1-800 number for reservations. The man I spoke with on the phone was very bored sounding and seemed like he didn't want to answer the few questions that I had. He then continually got information wrong that I repeated for him several times. My name is a fairly generic name that quite a few people have and he mispelled this three times as well as asked me to repeat my email address for confirmation three times and still got that wrong as well. I ended up having to call back twice to before the trip even started to fix reservation mistakes he had made. At this point I was getting a little worried about check in running smoothly. Check-in was actually a good experience. The front desk was very helpful and speedy despite it being quite busy in the lobby. There was also fresh fruit for the taking if you so choose. The lobby and first impression was also very nice and I was feeling like we had made a good decision in choosing this hotel. Also we choose self parking which is in a parking garage across the street. Easy to locate and we did not have any issues, however do remember to register your plate so as not to be charged by the ppl running the parking garage as it is not just the hotel. The room was ok, nothing special. It was very clean and was roomy. It was simple and standard budget hotel. This was fine as we choose the hotel for the location not for any fancy decor or amenities. The location was indeed very good! College stop on the ttc subway line is literally two minute walk from hotel and Eaton Centre, Dundas Square was a few blocks away as well. We took a cab from the Hockey Hall of Fame back to hotel and was only $8 so it was very convenient location. We also took advantage of the pool and hot tub. The pool is a somewhat small pool-typical lap pool. I believe the hours were 6am-11pm and the fitness room was open 24hours. Breakfast was a little dissapointing. It is in fact a buffet or you can order off of a menu. There is plenty of fruit, cereal, oatmeal, ham, bacon, sausage, home fries, etc as well as serve yourself waffle maker and also omlette station with chef. Our waiter never cleared our plates, we had to ask for drinks and barely saw him. The few times we did see him there was no smile or welcome or conversation. The chef for the omelette station dissapeared a lot and we had to hunt to find somebody to ask for syrup, etc as many things were empty. The food was just ok as well. It satisfied our needs but would definitely not have paid full price for it. Upon checking out beware of checking over your bill. We were charged for both valet service as well as self parking even though we were only there one night with one car and most definitely did not use both. The front desk was very quick to take the charge off when I brought it to their attention however. Check-out is at 12pm and you can leave your car parked there until 5pm. Overall it was an ok experience with a great location. If I was to book again I would stay at the Delta Chelsea which is quite close (you can see it upon heading to the Courtyard on Yonge st.) and as have stayed there before found it to be much superior with same good location.

The valet was very easy and helpful (they do offer IN/OUT, which I wasn't sure about before we got there). We had a room with two queen beds, and were very surprised at how big the room actually was. One note: the layout of the hotel is a bit different. There are two towers of rooms, with the elevators in the middle of each tower.

If you are looking for a simple place to lay your head at night, this hotel might be worth looking into. We choose this hospital for its proximity to St. Michael\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospital, a family member was undergoing a serious procedure, and being from out of town we wanted to stay somewhere close by. For the rate of $130 per night which included an amazing hot breakfast buffet (absolutely recommend the breakfast buffet, with the fresh baked croissants and made to order omelets) and complementary coffee/tea station, we were more then satisfied with our stay, however a few niggles are worthy of mention. Elevator issues\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 During our five day stay, the elevator (s) were continuously out of service, as one member of our party suffers from COPD, taking the stairs were not always an option, thankfully they allowed guests to use the service elevator. To be fair, I should mention we were compensated for the inconvenience by having our $30 per day Valet Parking charge removed from our final bill. Housekeeping\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Twice during the five day stay, we arrived back from the hospital to find our room had not been cleaned, completely missed by the house cleaning staff. After a very long day at the hospital, I truly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate having to call down to the front desk to request our room to be cleaned, and to be honest, I was not impressed with the level of cleanliness when they did arrive, things like rinsing the glasses with cold water instead of replacing them with new clean glasses bothered me. Maintenance/Overall General Condition\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Okay, so something that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t often bother me but worth noting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The actual maintenance of the hotel needs to be ramped up. We actually had large areas of peeling paint on both the bathroom and bedroom ceilings, the carpets were worn, the drapery dirty, and in our opinion, the beds were very old, springy and quite uncomfortable. Although the front lobby was quite nice with a real urban chic feel, the actual rooms themselves and hotel walkways, felt more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ghetto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then anything else. This is nothing that a bit of plaster, paint and a real good clean-up couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fix which is why I found it a bit frustrating. Pool/Work out room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Very, very small pool, which was overlooked by those using the gym. We were not at this hotel for entertainment purposes, however in hindsight, it would have been nice to jump into the pool and/or hot tub to relax for an hour or so in the evening, however, this pool area was not conducive to a spa/zen type experience, for that matter, the pool is so small I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it adding any work-out value either. Again, for the price point, we were happy with our stay, it served our purpose, and we really, really appreciated the HUGE breakfast (bacon, sausages, potatoes, eggs, waffles, fresh baked goods, fruit, cereal, yogurts), and complementary coffee each morning, and when faced with an issue (non working elevators), the front desk staff, did do their best to assist us. I would rate this hotel as a 3 star establishment with the ability to be so much more. All this hotel really needs is a more regimented maintenance program, room updates and maybe a new pool retrofit. I would consider coming back for a repeat visit.

Sadly, it was only for one night, but I got to visit a good friend and enjoy a lovely walk around the city in the evening. My friend recommended this hotel for its excellent location and service. She wasn't kidding. This hotel was really nice and comfortable. A few things you should know about this hotel: -- The room was comfy, had a nice a nice HDTV and plenty of space. The bed was comfortable and the space was quiet. All good things. -- My AAA rate included breakfast in the hotel's Yonge St. Grille. A server brought us beverages, and the buffet included quiche, eggs, made-to-order omelets, ham, bacon, sausage, yogurt, pastries, fresh fruit, several varieties of milk cartons, cereal, bagels, artisan breads, etc. I was really impressed. I only wished I could have eaten there more than one day. -- Complimentary Wi-Fi was somewhat slow in the room, but not terrible. I just plugged in via the included ethernet cord. It was fine for my needs. -- The hotel has two computers and a printer just off the lobby dedicated to printing out boarding passes (it actually says \"BOARDING PASSES\" in big silver letters on the wall above the computers). I used it to print some Google Maps... same difference. It was fast, free and awesome. Such a nice touch! -- Parking is $30 for full valet and $25 for self-parking. BUT... the hotel does NOT offer IN and OUT privileges. Bear that in mind when you park your car. The self-parking lot is right across the street (well, almost... it's across the street and down a few feet), so it's super convenient if you want quick access to your car. But, it's only open from 6 a.m.-11 p.m. So, be sure you won't need to take off between 11 p.m.-6 a.m. because your car is not accessible. It worked fine for me because I didn't need my car until 10 a.m. the next morning. -- There are complimentary, pre-packaged Otis Spunkmeyer cookies for the taking at the check-in desk. Yum! -- The location is great, within walking distance of so many restaurants, shops and public transportation. Toronto feels very safe in those surroundings and I enjoyed walking around getting to know the city. Bottom line: This is a great hotel in a fantastic city.

The rooms were nice and clean, comfortable stay, nice property, great location. However one bad experience basically was all that was left in my memory of this hotel. My boyfriend's parents were in town staying at the Courtyard for New Years. We all went out for dinner and agreed to meet up at Nathan Phillips Square for the new years celebrations. However, we couldn't get a hold of them via cellphone and after celebrating decided to walk back to the hotel to find his parents. Upon arriving at the hotel we were told by a security guard at the elevator that he could not let us up to the room without a stamp and that we must go to the front desk to get one. These stamps were apparently a New Years policy that the hotel has. Upon check-in the person who made the reservation must register all guests staying in the room, and if you were not registered you could not go back up to your room. His father was not informed of this policy upon checkin, nor were we informed on the way out to dinner. My boyfriend had a room key, had photo ID with the last name of the registered guest (his father) and explained that we were going up to the room to wait for his parents. The unhelpful concierge told us that we should call up to the room to see if the guest was there. After calling with no answer, the concierge told us there was nothing he could do and that we would just have to wait. After waiting for half an hour, my boyfriend went back to complain that it was ridiculous he could not be allowed up into his room even though he was the son of the registered guest. After almost 20 minutes of arguing, we finally got these ridiculous stamps. We headed back to the elevator, told the security guard we had gotten our stamps (which could only be seen with a blacklight) only to have him not even check! Some policy... Another couple walked by (relativly older) and the guard did not ask to see their stamps. However, when two girls in their early teens came by, the guard ordered them to go to the front desk. Overall it was absolutely ridiculous that we were not allowed to go up to the room because of some policy that we were not even informed about at the time of checkin!

As others have said, the location is very good unless. Totally walkable to the museums, markets, malls, parks, subway and streetcars. The breakfast buffet is excellent and worth the extra cost. The reception staff was friendly and professional. The hotel was crowded on a busy holiday weekend (Canada Day/July Fourth/Toronto Pride). Some of our party had a hard time getting into their rooms as they were not ready (for some as late as 6PM). The rooms are not very nicely decorated. The bathrooms do not have a sink (or mirror) and just a small hook that doesn't hold anything larger or heavier than a T-shirt!!! You have to walk out and around to the other side of the room to wash your hands. The carpet is new and plush. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows were oddly small. No mini-fridge in the room, though one was provided when requested. No security box in the room, just on offer at the reception desk with the old double-key system. The staff was helpful when we needed access. It is just very inconvenient. Housekeeping was spotty. One day the room was not made up until after 6 PM, when there was a rap at the door and we were told if we wanted the room serviced we had to step out of the room NOW, because her shift was about up. The next morning (Saturday) there was a rap at the door BEFORE 9 AM and a different housekeeper was standing there and loudly told me to \"put the sign on the door\" but I pointed out that there was no (do not disturb) sign so she just walked away without apology or explanation (or paper sign) having obviously disturbed us on a holiday morning! And I heard her tapping on other doors that didn't have signs not to be disturbed. We are talking 8:50 on a Saturday morning!!! Housekeeping staff needs some attitude adjustment. They could be more generous with towels, especially since some are in the bath/shower room and some are at the sink. Soap and shampoo were fine. Furniture was dusty. There is a large and well-equipped exercise room, small pool, kiddy pool and whirlpool on the lower level. One time I went down and there were 10 teenage boys rough-housing in the pool and whirlpool with no adult in the area. I guess I could have called the manager, but didn't. Other guests also turned around and went out of the pool area to avoid the splashing and mayhem. Finally, the elevators are swift and internet is free.

Despite this we decided to extend our stay by one night and paid \"rack\" price. We dealt with the same counter person for booking the second night and his attitude was only slightly better. On check out though the person we dealt with was wonderful. The valet was impressive also! Overall this was a good stay. The room was clean for the most part. I noticed dirt in the same places I find in low quality hotels though. Corners, door handles and light switches. I did expect a bit more for the cost. The room was a very good size, the bed and pillows as well as the bedding were very comfortable and clean. I liked having the business center available for computer usage since I do not travel with a laptop. The hotel is lovely and I can handle attitude from people .

Unfortunately, they ran out of gift cards but promptly took $20 off our bill before we had a chance to notice. The rest of the amenities were delivered as promised and proved to be very handy, especially the valet parking. This hotel is very well located in downtown Toronto.

Eaton Centre is a 10 minute walk, College Park is even closer and Bloor Street is a little farther away. The subway station is 2 minutes away if you want to travel anywhere of distance and that makes it pretty easy to get to if you are using public transit to come from the airport or Union station. There are a number of other activities to do in the area within walking distance (20 - 30 minutes at the most) and we were able to afford it given the great rate. The hotel was larger than I thought and the room was clean and large. There were a number of businesses and airlines that put their employees here so it can't be that bad of a place.

In fact, after I use the shampoo, I didn't even need to put hair gel, my hair was styled already because the shampoo is SO gluey and heavy..... I am not joking! I didn't use my hair gel for the two days that I was there and my hair looked spiky the whole time because of the shampoo. - The bed sheets smell like bleach way too much. This can be a good thing, because it means bed sheets are probably very clean. But the smell was very very strong. With the combination of gluey shampoo, I just wasn't feeling comfortable when sleeping. - The pool and jacuzzi. Two years ago, the jacuzzi was one of my favorite part of this hotel. But this time, they put too much chemical in jacuzzi too! My body stinks really bad after I use it. And the over-drying-your-body soap they have doesn't really wash the smell away. I smells like chlorine for two days after using the jacuzzi. Overall, I still like this hotel. I mean, its got \"location\", \"service\", \"cleanliness\" and the \"spacious room\".

One small negative, though I suspect it is temporary, is that there is only one computer for internet access in the lobby of the hotel. This is a big hotel. I noticed they are working on a business room that wasn't finished yet, so this looks like it will improve. We had a great AAA rate that included 2 breakfast coupons each day for the buffet.

We were informed with a letter under the door on a Thursday that the hotel would be testing their fire alarms the next day at noon. We were planning on checking out earlier in the morning, so we felt this wouldn't affect us. In fact, we were happy to see they were doing the testing (being married to a former fireman, we do take this stuff seriously). However, we had no idea that they would shut down the elevators at around 9:35 that morning. So here we were, with heavy luggage on the 8th floor, wondering why the elevators wouldn't work. We called down to the desk, was told that it was supposed to be noon but apparently started earlier, and no estimate as to how long. After waiting a while - facing an 11 hour ride home, we ended up dragging our luggage down 8 flights of stairs. Thank heavens a cleaning woman heard us and gave us a tip to go down a hallway to another stairwell so we could get to the lobby (apparently our stairwell would not have done so). My husband had already gone down a additional flight before he heard this. I can't say I was pleased.

We had the AAA package that included two breakfast buffets, so we paid about $16 for the third. They had fresh fruit, pastries, omlet station, belgian waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, etc. - very nice. Room was very clean and we had no noise issues. Location was great, very close to a subway stop. We opted for valet parking ($30 daily) and the car was brought to us very quickly each time. I liked the hotel and would recommend it to others. I was not aware of a business section - just thought that all they had was the one computer in the lobby. For a hotel this large, there should be more than one computer available for guests to use for a short time. We asked the front desk to recommend a fish & chips place and a guest that was registering was kind enough to point us to Harbour Fish & Chip - my husband and son loved it - very small, unfancy place but really really good.

We arrived late at night on 07/24/09 and checked out the morning of 07/26/09. I am a Marriott Rewards member and booked a room with a balcony. Upon check-in we received a balcony room on the 10th floor. Parking at the hotel is $30 a day for valet parking or $25 a day for self parking. Valet parking is in a secure underground garage with in/out privileges. Self parking is in a lot across the street from the hotel. If driving to the hotel, you must turn down either Wood St or Alexander St to get to hotel (even though it is on Yonge St). Our room was large enough for 2 persons although it was an L shape. The bath area had an odd layout. The tub and toilet were in a small room on one side of the entry way (close to the door to the room) and the sink/mirror/closet were on the opposite side and closer to the main part of the room. We had a king size bed in the room however the mattress left a lot to be desired. The bedding in this room was not what I expected to find in a Courtyard hotel. Have slept on worse beds, but also have slept on much better. Our room was on the south side of the building facing east, so from our balcony we only had views of the apartment building next door. If you get a balcony room at this hotel, request one facing Yonge Street or save your money and don't bother with the balcony. The location of the hotel was good. Just 1 block to the College subway station and the Carlton/College street cars. There is a 24 hour ShoppersMart pharmacy directly across the street from the hotel as well. Plenty of places to eat near the hotel as well. Our favorite place to eat while in Toronto is Richtree Market Restaurant at 42 Yonge St. On this trip we had breakfast & dinner there Saturday. The restaurant is setup like a market with many stations. Butcher shop, pasta bar, salad bar, sushi bar, fresh juice bar, and the list goes on. One thing that many people seem to have a problem with is find out how to get into this restaurant. You enter from Yonge St, but you must go thru the revolving door going into Brookfield Place. Once in there, you will find the entrance to the restaurant. Also on this trip we found a new place for breakfast/lunch called Cora's Breakfast & Lunch. This restaurant is only 1 block from the hotel at 27 Carlton St. Lot of healthy options and tons of wonderful fresh fruit.", "Date": "August 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Friendly Staff, Excellent Visit\u201d", "Author": "barefootgal88", "ReviewID": "UR36279088", "Content": "The hotel was easy to find, very centrally located.

Though I would have loved to have stayed at the even nicer Marriott Eaton Centre, where we've stayed many times, it would have been crazy to upgrade to that hotel vs. this one at this price --- under $80USD at a name-brand Marriott property in downtown Toronto w/breakfast. buffet... can't be beat. Even with a $30CDN/night valet parking charge added in ($25 for self-park) - we spent significantly less than anything approaching the quality and location of this hotel. Hotel is located on the east side of Yonge Street, just about an 8-10 minute walk (or two subway stops) south of the Bloor Street shopping area and perhaps another 10 minute walk north of the Eaton Centre shopping mall. College subway stop is one short block south - perhaps a 2 minute walk - and a 24 hour food/pharmacy is between hotel and subway - a great place to pick up drinks and snacks on your way back home. Between just the subway and walking - you can get pretty much anywhere in downtown Toronto in 15-20 minutes, tops... - if not much less. Hotel has recently - within a few years - been redone - and public areas are sparkling. Rooms are nicely updated - including especially comfy, newly-plush Marriott bedding w/pillowtop mattress/pad plus a mid-sized flat-screen TV. Hotel and rooms, however, are decades old and only so much they could do to the smallish overall size and small and not-so-redone bathroom and sink area (outside bath/toilet area). There is a desk w/free internet (cabled or wireless) - but a club chair barely fit between our 2nd queen bed and the window... Minor issues.... As for the \"free\" breakfast - it would have saved us another $34 ($17x2) on the 2nd day - had it not been so mediocre on the first.... I'm sure some folks probably love any free, hot breakfast buffet - but we're much more about quality than \"free\" - so were fine to seek out our own food, at our own cost for 2 adults and a child, on day 2 -- since the room was a great deal with or without the breakfast thrown in (which we didn't even realize when we booked the room) - but we at least tried on day one. Overall, unless you are expecting Four Seasons comfort and luxury - this hotel will suit most folks very well, especially if food is thrown in.

We had 2 connecting rooms, and were traveling with our 4 kids and 2 of their friends. The review will be point form...hopefully easier to write and to read!! Finding the hotel and parking: - found it easier to turn onto Church Street, then head north a few feet so we could turn right off of Younge St.. -The street right before hotel is Wood St....this is where you turn right. -had hubby drop us and luggage off at front door, and he headed across street to Parklink, city parking...underground. Hotel charges $30.00 per night to park valet, or $25.00 self park...both of there are in the same lot, adjacent to hotel....outdoor parking. The covered parking right across Wood Street (you can see it from front of hotel...very close) was a total of $16.00 for entire weekend (Friday 5:30pm until Sunday 1:00pm). I think it is cheaper on the weekend than during the week, but certainly NOT 30.00 per 24hrs. Check in: -we booked directly with hotel and took copies of our confirmation...no problems -arrived about 5:30pm, and check in attendant didn't know if he had any connecting rooms. I told him as long as we were close it would be fine....but he kept at it, and found us one. -lobby was fairly busy...lots of people checking in, and lots of airline staff checking out -cookies were available at front desk -there were a few nice couches and chairs in lobby, but because it was so busy, it wasn't really enough -there are 2 towers...north and south. North has 7 floors, and the south 17. To get from one to the other, you need to go through the lobby area. -we were in north tower 3rd floor....connecting rooms -asked if we had a laptop, they offer wireless...but you need an access code The room: -looked like the pictures on their website -clean and no odors -we had 2 queens, an armchair by the window, a comfy desk chair and fairly large desk -LCD TV, worked well -dresser had 4 drawers and was spacious -mirrored closet doors with hangers that are easy to take off and use -sink and mirror separate from the bath and toilet...had blow dryer. Counter area was quite small, and the coffee maker was there as well. We did not use the coffee maker. -bath/toilet area quite small, but clean. Pressure was good, and tub drained well. - amenities...shampoo, conditioner, lotion, body bar and face bar -offered many lamps/lights and a big window, so light was not a problem -noise....the first night there was a lot of traffic noise...sirens, etc., but probably because we were on a low floor. A higher one would have helped with this. Also, there were MANY Christmas parties going on right underneath us in their ballrooms. We could hear the bass thumping until about 2:00AM both nights. The first night it bothered me, but the 2nd night it did not...I must've been used to it. Again, a higher floor would have helped. Pool and fitness area: -long and somewhat narrow pool...pretty cool water. Cold actually...great for after a workout, but cold for kids...and me!!! -hot, large hot tub, but jets are very mild, no real bubbles...which I actually liked, but not typical -small, shallow children's pool...quite cool. -hot tub and kiddy pool were tiled and looked very clean, but pool was cement or something, and seemed very discoloured. The water seemed clean, so we went for it. It did look odd however, like the surface of the pool needed repainting. It looked kind of green. - there were several upright chairs, loungers, and small tables around the pool -fitness centre overlooked the pool area - female change rooms were spacious and had a big rack of towels. - 2 showers...1 handicapped. Both were large and offered soap and shampoo in dispensers. Water was nice and hot. - had 2 blow dryers, and 3 sinks, as well as 2 toilet stalls -male change rooms had towels, showers, soap, shampoo,etc...but I don't know the set up -fitness centre had treadmills, and a bunch of other machines(sorry...don't know the names). Free weights, exercise ball,etc. - the machines all had a screen to watch TV, and there were earbud phones to use...and keep. They were in plastic bags in a basket near the front door -there were cups and a cold water machine as well as towels - a key card was needed to get into the pool/fitness area, then again to get into the fitness room door -there were no signs about an age limit, but when I called the front desk, I was told 18 -area seemed very modern and clean ****note about this area...as we were in the north tower, and the pool was in the south tower, we had to trek with the kids...in their swimsuits and cover ups) , through the lobby area, past several ballrooms, and right past a restaurant to get there. It did feel awkward...and cold on the way back!! I would definitely ask to stay in south tower next time...then it's just an elevator ride.***** Restaurant/Lounges There was a lounge, but we did not use it, so we cannot comment. I did see a TV in there and it seemed quite spacious. - the only time we used the restaurant was for breakfast. The rate for the cold buffet was $13.95 and for the hot buffet $16.95. It was half price for kids 6 - 12, and I think under 6 was free. -We would never pay that much for breakfast, but luckily breakfast was included for 2 adults each room, each night because of CAA rate. -breakfast has typical pastries, toasts, bagels, muffins, etc. Milk, chocolate milk, coffee, tea, and juice are included. Yogourt, cereals, granola, fruit salad, pineapple, pear, oranges, grapefruit bowls,etc. Also...hot food...scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, potato cakes, hash, beans, pancakes....rock hard pucks...were not good, french toast. They also has fresh, do it yourself waffles with strawberry sauce and whipped cream...YUM!!!!, also hot syrup. Had a chef making custom omelets(sp??). choices...bacon bits, sausage, ham, onions, green peppers, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, cheese,...full egg, or egg white only. These were very good,***** but a note to those with allergies or vegetarians.... he makes 2 at a time, and uses the same spatula for both. So speak up if that is a concern**** - if you have the AAA/CAA breakfast rate, you just sign breakfast to your room, and the front desk staff will deduct 2 adult prices. Tips are extra. Surrounding Area: - area seemed very safe, right on busy Younge Street. Some of us were walking home about 11:00pm Saturday night and had no concerns. -just outside the hotel...on Younge Street, there is a Pizza Pizza....STAY AWAY!!!! We had a couple of different slices, both tasteless and burnt hard. My hubby brought them back to the room for the kids and I....even my kids would not eat them. Before I had a chance to tell the older kids not to go there, they did. They said their pizza slices were old and hard as well...and felt somewhat sick after eating the breadsticks. - there is a 24HR McDonald's kittie corner to the Pizza place. -24 hour Shoppers Drugmart a few minutes walk south on Younge Street - of course, lots of other restaurants within a few minutes walk...Swiss Chalet, Bistros etc. Check Out: -Express check out papers under our door on check out morning,. No mistakes, but went to desk as I always do before leaving. - one note...we booked 2 rooms, all under the same family, but had 2 different confirmation #'s, and 2 separate bills. This might be typical...I don't usually book 2 rooms. This was a very busy hotel....meetings, parties, conferences, etc, but still seemed comfortable ( except when coming of going from the pool!!!).

The room was small, the sink was located on the opposite side of the miniature sized room than the bathroom.

An hour for champagne glasses?? I would have gladly used the 1 coffee cup they had in the room had I known it was such a hassle. And when they finally did arrive, they weren't champagne glasses, they were wine glasses. Housekeeping also failed to replace toiletries, so Sunday morning we awoke with not enough lotion, soap, shampoo & conditioner. Not wanting to \"disturb the housekeeping\" I decided to make do and not call them. I think writing a review is a much more effective way to go about things. The entire morning the house keeping staff would prop the door open with the deadbolt hook so that the door wouldn't shut behind them. Every 5 minutes you could hear the door slam up against the deadbolt lock.... this started happening at 9 am and didn't stop until 11am. Now, even I know it's not good for the door frame to do that.. so I'm not sure why house keeping would do such a thing, aside from disturbing guests!

The carpet was new and everything was clean and working properly. The only real issue we had was with the bed. The bed seemed like it was \"done\"...it squeaked badly and was both hard and saggy. The linens were lovely and soft. We couldn't get the \"wake up call\" feature on the phone to work, but the alarm clock worked perfectly. Express check out was a breeze and the hotel kept our luggage for us (at no charge) til late afternoon. They also offered late checkout, but since we really just needed a place for our luggage, we didn't make use of that.", "Date": "September 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery Good Value for Money\u201d", "Author": "cngw", "ReviewID": "UR20284221", "Content": "The Marriott Courtyard Downtown Toronto is located at the corner of Yonge and Wood streets. The location is excellent for accessing all that downtown Toronto has to offer. The Eaton Centre shopping mall is an easy 8 minute walk and the College Subway is one very short block away. An earlier review indicated that the location was somewhat dubious with odd persons lingering around - I didn't see or experience anything of that nature. The hotel itself appears to have been recently renovated complete with a building facelift. The lobby is tastefully designed, modern and clean and is a good reflection of what my room on the 16th (members) floor was to offer. Check-in was a breeze and I observed that they handled check-in and check-out quite efficiently - even at peak evening time. The King room on the 16th floor was extremely spacious - i don't think I'd even been in a hotel room with a corridor! It was extremely clean - fresh spotless bed linen, new carpets, the furniture was in good shape and the air-conditioner worked well (albeit a tad noisy) and very quiet. The decor is standard Marriott - don't expect boutique hotel style here - but was perfectly acceptable and relatively new. The 26\" LCD TV is now standard as well as the in-room coffee maker, bottled water and the very reliable and adequate complimentary Internet service. The balcony is fully accessible to let in that breath of fresh air, when needed. The oddest thing was the bathroom - while completely adequate with shower, tub and WC - the sink, faucet and mirror are located down the corridor! Took a bit getting used - the bedroom slippers (mine) - and the plush shower mantle (complimentary) - really came in handy! Breakfast was a big - and good - surprise - a full buffet from 06:30 and I didn't have to wait for a table on any morning. If one is in a rush, there is complimentary take-away coffee and tea in the mornings as well. All staff were extremely courteous, knowledgeable, helpful and professional - a refreshing difference!

He could not have been more helpful, and our check-in took just a couple of minutes. Our room was very spacious and clean, and was equipped with a large flat screen television. The bed was huge and extremely comfy. Maid service was excellent also, and we had a daily newspaper delivered every morning free of charge. Downstairs, in the lobby, free coffee was available every morning, which I collected and took back up to our room. Although we had coffee making facilities in our room, the coffee was only decaf. We ate breakfast out the first day at a place called Great Eggspectations on Younge Street. It serves nice food, and not overpriced. However, we found that the hotel was offering a buffet breakfast slightly cheaper so we decided to try that. The buffet offered everything from breads, pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurts, all kinds of hot food, and you could even get the chef to cook your own omelette to order. I had some mixed fruit to start with followed by a full breakfast, of bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, tomato, and beans. It was the best scrambled egg that I have ever tasted without a doubt....

Our only problem was that we did the \"self-park\" option in the parking garage across the street from the hotel. When we returned to our car two days later, we found two parking violation tickets on the vehicle, stating that we had not registered the vehicle.

The location was close to Eaton Centre and many interesting bars and restaurants. It was so easy to walk to dinner or find something to do in the evening. That was a definite plus. With so many nice places to eat nearby, we never dined in the hotel restaurant. I did take advantage of the free coffee in the lobby in the mornings, and it was surprisingly good. One drawback was that there were obvious drug deals going on right outside the hotel. While I was never approached, it was unnerving to look out my windows and see that sort of activity. I was told by local colleagues that the area is not the best. They charged an arm and a leg for parking - I think $20 or $30 CDN per day. While I realize that any hotel in a major city will charge for parking, it did seem a bit extreme. My days on this trip were spent out in the suburbs, not in the city, and next time I will stay at a hotel in the 'burbs to avoid an hourlong drive to and from the hotel each morning and evening. When I booked the hotel, I underestimated the time it would take to reach the work site. There was road work going on nearby that complicated the driving situation even more. The room was pleasant, with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom had been recently remodeled. Free internet access was fast. The TV had the usual channels. It was your typical Courtyard guestroom - the consistency across the chain is why I continue to book at Marriott properties.

Breakfast buffet which came with the price of our room was very good - very large selection of hot/cold foods - the price listed was $15 or $16 dollars, which is a lot for what it is. If I had to pay, I'd go elsewhere. Negatives - wifi signal was weak throughout the hotel, and I was never able to get a strong enough signal for my wifi enabled phone to check my e-mail. Pool was cold - I'm not super picky here, but there were some kids who got to the pool at the same time as us, and they didn't even want to get in!. Hot tub was too hot - we tried it for a few minutes and it left a red water line on our bodies. We always pay a bit extra for a hotel with a pool, so this was a pretty big disappointment for us. The biggest negative had to be the parking, or I think more accurately the hotel and staff's dishonesty in my opinion regarding this. They charge $25 for self park, and $30 for valet - no problem, free market. As soon as we pulled up a valet came over and wanted to know which option we chose, so they could bill it to our room. I said no, I wanted to check out other parking lots (free market), and asked them about the one that was about 6 feet from where I was sitting in my vehicle. He said he 'didn't know anything about it' and walked away. When we went to check in we asked the front desk staff about alternative parking, and she said she really didn't know of any, and when we pressed she suggested our vehicle really wouldn't be safe anywhere other than the hotel lot. We left and right across the street is a self park where we paid $14 or 26 hours! I actually think it is the same lot the hotel uses for self park, but there are machines where you can buy tickets as well in the lot. There was also a sign that said the lot was patrolled. So, if it was cheap I'd stay here again, but I certainly would not pay for the hotel parking.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cLovely Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Prone2Pusillanimous", "ReviewID": "UR15041705", "Content": "We stayed here for a family vacation.

The stay was excellent in all ways, with just a couple of small complaints. Checkin was very quick \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they just needed a credit card and we were on our way. The room was a single king (as ordered). The room itself was a little smallish, but not a big deal. I suspect it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like most bigger city downtown rooms. The bed was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very comfortable and the linen was very nice. There was a fair bit of street noise from Yonge street (our room faced Yonge). If you are a light sleeper you might want to ask for a room away from Yonge Street. The curtains provided for a very dark room. The shower was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite large and a nice shower spray. The bathroom sink is away from the bathroom itself. You might like or dislike this arrangement. I like it because it means one can shower while the other is shaving or doing makeup etc. You might feel differently. The exercise room was excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 4 lifestyle treadmills with TVs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and some weight machines. The room was large and clean. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the pool but we did look at it and checked the water. It was good, but I must admit it was the narrowest pool I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever seen. It would have been good for swimming laps, but not very good for water polo or other games. The hot tub looked good. We had breakfast every morning (included) and the buffet was marvelous.

It was all fresh, warm and nicely presented. We had drinks in the lounge that evening after our team won the Grey Cup. It was fine with lots of choice and good service. The area is good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three full blocks to the Eaton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Centre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c took us about 10 minutes to walk. There are lots of fast food restaurants in the area. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd restaurants, but I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking very hard for them. We never felt unsafe walking in the area, even after dark. The hotel is one block from the College street subway station. From there it is about a 10 minute subway ride to Skydome (right near Lake Ontario), or about 25 minutes to Yorkdale Mall at the other end of the line. As to complaints, we had two\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. 1. The building has 4 elevators (it is a 20 plus floor tower) and they were working on the elevators and had more than one out of service. This made for very slow elevator service. We used the stairs when going down. After our second day there, all the elevators were working and service was fine. 2. The wireless internet access is sketchy at best. The best speed I could muster was 11mbs, and it would freeze and become unusable about every 5 minutes. So I switched to wired access. This was much better, but would also freeze once or twice a day. Fortunately, I knew how to reset the access, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid many people would have been without access. The room price was about right. It was a little pricey but it was Grey Cup week.

I've stayed at worse Courtyards in the US and better Courtyards in Europe. This one in Toronto is in the middle. The hotel was in the midst of a remodel. Work progressed quickly while I was there and they said it would be complete by mid July. Looked nice even though it was in progress. The guest rooms were done already, but I can tell you that the \"non-smoking\" policy was new. The first room they put me in was nice and big, with new furniture and carpet, but it still smelled like an ashtray. I have some status with Marriott, but still they said I couldn't move. After a couple polite calls to the manager they found a room for me -- one that was \"non-smoking\" before they switched the entire hotel to non-smoking. Smaller but better. One plus: air conditioning worked great,. The bar in the hotel closed early and room service ended at 10:00. Biggest complaint was the lack of mini-bar. Maybe this is due to a local ordinance, but still annoying. The local booze store closed early, so I was stuck with local bars to get my buzz on. The restaurant and bar seemed dismal and I found nearby establishments happy to cater to me. The hotel is on the fringe of the gay neighborhood, so there were many bars providing diversion (to the north and east). And if you're not gay, lots of straight bars as well. The Yonge street environs were definitely catering to the out-of-towners. I also found diversion on an Irish pub crawl with colleagues from Finland and Ireland toward the south west. (Note to self: avoid pub crawls with Finns and Irishmen.) As for the hotel, the bed was comfy. The windows don't really open, but you can slide a mini-window open for a few inches of fresh air. Conference facilities in the basement were maze-like. But the big plus was free internet in the rooms.

We arrived late and check in was painless & polite. They did not ask for CAA card(don't have one) and included breakfast each morning for no extra charge. The heater was not working, but it was very late and we were in bed for the night before we realized, so we called down for an extra blanket. They brought us a cotton sheet the first time, so I called back and they brought us a duvet. They did offer to have maintenance look at the heater. Room was king sized bed with a man made duvet(fake), lots of pillows of every size. Very small room & very unatractive with only 1 picture. Reminded me of a hospital room. You could almost touch the door from one side of the bed and the window from the other. The bathroom was located at the foot of the bed. It had a shower & toilet only. The sink & coat closet were in a corridor at the foot of the bed also. Very inconvienent & unsanitary. The fan in the bathroom did not work so it made all the windows steam up and wrecked our view. The towels were very soft, and there was a small bottle of shampoo. The carpet was worn & dirty and you had to keep your shoes on. I called down for a new room in the am, and they did not hesitate and promptly moved us to the 11th floor. Bigger room, yet unique like the last one. The bathroom (with toilet & shower) were right beside the front door. Down the hall 10 more feet were the coat closet & sink. Down the hall 10 more feet was the bedroom. It was larger than the last room and the carpet was less used and vacumed. (I met a guy in the elevator who told me he was contracted to replace ALL carpets on all floors). The white sheets were in need of replacement, as they were discolored and no longer white. There was a very small balcony and we could see the CN tower. The windows were very drafty but the heat worked well so it wasn't a problem. Regular parking was $20(if even available). They do not guarantee it, and additional parking was 2 blocks away. Valet parking was $25. Breakfast was incredible ! If you didn't have time for a sit down, they had a small area where you could just grab & go, with variety, coffee and bottled juices. Employees were all smiling, friendly & helpful. The location is great. 10 minute walk took me the the Eatons Centre, with lots of great shops along the way. Lots of restaurants you could walk to, but no 'chains' if that is what you are looking for.

The same member of the engineering team visited again, went to the bathroom and ran the water while playing with the faucet for about 15 minutes. Before he left he showed me that there was hot water and he reported that the problem was fixed. The next morning, no hot water. Via phon, an impatient front desk agent told me that only way to get hot water was to run the tap for 15 minutes or more. I do think that a quiet room with operational shower is an unreasonable expectation and per the chain's motto it was to be exceeded.

There is a Metro (Subway) Entrance only two blocks away which we used regularly. We also walked from the hotel to the center of town around the Eaton Center took about 15 minutes.

They don't, and it was cheaper to park in a City Parking Lot next door then use the hotel's parking.

Shop till you drop in this part of town for everything! I do think some of the sidestreet neighborhoods should not be traveled alone late at night, but then again, do you really want to walk in any major downtown alone late at night? Also, they have the Marriott beds, which in my opinion are the most comfortable of any hotel chain. This hotel was a cut above th average courtyard in terms of service, price and location. However, parking at $20 a day is lame, but free high speed internet made me happy. Some carpets, hallways a little dated, but clean and nice.

The room: In a big double-room with a big comfortable kingsize bed, 2 decent pillows per person (a first in our experience since usually you get a crappy pillow with the thickness of a towel), good matrass. The room was spacious and hosted a desk with big business chair, a two-seater + other chair. Free wired and wireless Internet connection, though the wireless version didn't work most of the time. A minor gripe though. Bathroom with shower bath and toilet, sink was outside the room. Convenient for when two persons have to get ready at the same time, awkward when you want to wash your hands after going to the loo. A working airco, though you cannot decide yourself which temperature. And curtains that really darkened the room. Hardly noise problems, despite that we had a room opposing the elevator. And most importantly, it was really, really clean and well maintained. And if you want the change the bed linnen and towels everyday. Outstanding. Hotel: The people hosting the frontdesk are capable, friendly and helpful. Everything is clean and looks in perfect order. There should be a swimmingpool and fitnessroom, though we didnt use that. We did use the roomservice though. Twice we ate in (Yonge Street Grill). The food is pretty good, a very nice burger and fries, two delicious rice dishes with cocos and chicken/fish. Delivered by a very friendly guy in 30 -60 mins. Breakfast is standard not included. Not a problem, at walking distance (i.e. less than 5 mins across the street) you will already find 3 breakfast places. Either Starbucks or the much cheaper Tim Horton chain are excellent alternatives. Especially Tim Horton is really cheap. For 2 cappucino, and 3 muffins you pay about $6.50. If you prefer to pay for breakfast at the hotel is that ofcourse entirely up to you. Location: Courtyard is located at Yonge Street, which holds the record for being the longest street in the world. The entrance however is at Wood St. (a side street of Yonge). The closest subway station is College, a block or two away (a short stroll, 5 - 10 mins). Conveniently there are several groceries stores closeby. I would advice you Dominion (24 hrs open), which is located at Collegepark below Winners (again 5 mins away), which is also the place where you could get on the subway or enter the underground PATH. There is also a small foodcourt down there, but nothing special. Handy if you decide to eat in your hotelroom. They do make fresh and tasty pizzas there as well and are well assorted. However, Yonge has a gritty edge to it (as does most of Toronto). It certainly is not unsafe, at least not to our impression, but Yonge has a mix of grocery shops, sex-shops, (sex)clubs, decent bars, audio, books, restaurants (all kinds and all levels), art-galleries, malls, a Scientology church... so for all walks of life. Who you will encounter there as well. Nothing shocking if you regularly visit bigger towns, but if you come from a small rural town or you visit with very young children, you might find that a problem. If you stay south of Courtyard it is even less of a problem, since I think only the Zanzibar club is noticeably there. Apart from that, the location is great. Basically everything is at walking distance, as is public transport. Oh, when you arrive at Pearson Airport and you want to use the Toronto Airport Express (probably the best idea price/convenience ratio wise), that bus stops at the Delta Chelsea, which is 2 blocks away from the Courtyard by Marriot at a side street of Yonge.
