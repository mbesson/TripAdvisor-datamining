I stayed two nights and I think I paid around $180, but I want my money back!! The casino was closed, the pool was pathetic and closes at 6pm, no hot tub (even though it was advertised as having one) and the room was disgusting. We walked in and immediately noticed the disgusting smell, they had defrosted the mini fridge and left a wet towel dangling out of it so the room smelled of mildew (among other smells). I was afraid to walk on the carpet for fear of catching a disease, so we kept our flip flops on whenever walking around, even in the shower. There was an inexplicable leak in the bathroom, it seemed everytime we turned on the sink or took a shower there was a large puddle on the floor! The bed was hard as a rock, the slider door going onto the patio didnt close properly so we couldn't lock it and the noise from the street cannot be blocked by closing the slider, it almost got louder. The curtains had holes so you couldn't even try to block out the sun. They asked for a security deposit of $25 cash which is ridiculous, how could we make the room any worse?!? We had to buy a candle so we wouldn't want to vomit whenever we walked in the room. OH and there was a hole in our ceiling leading to the pipes which rattled horribly loud whenever the AC was on. Also no internet even though it was advertised to have it.

Let me be clear when I say that I have been to Beautiful Puerto Rico many times and everyone has been absolutely Wonderful so this review is specifically directed to the dis service provided by Mr Ayala(General Manager) and the \" Diamond Palace\". Can Someone Please Correct me if im Crazy... But I check in with my wife and 6 month old daughter for what was supposed to be a lengthy stay, we enter the room and it is absolutely filthy( i knew that it wasnt a 5 star hotel but this is rediculous) im talking about throw up on the carpet, unknown stains on the bed sheets, the toilet was over flown etc etc... I go down stairs to the front desk and kindly tell Mr. Figueroa who then calls \"Mr Ayala\" to whom I expressed that all we wanted was to be changed to a clean room(we didnt want a refund or an upgrade or anything else for that matter) just a clean room and his response to me was, we cant guarantee that, and I asked you cant guarantee what???(double beds, the view) what??? and he looks at me and says the cleanliness and I said EXCUSE ME!?!?!?!?! How can you be in the Hospitality business and not offer someone something as Basic as a clean room?... And he says your in a \"standard room' let me send someone upstairs to see whats the Big Problem and we'll call you, You all know how this ended... This Mr Ayala is certainly in the wrong business and truly should be Fired because im sure were not the 1st or last to come in contact with him. So whoever is the owner of this place please take some action here for the sake of your own business and reputation.

I do lots of leisure travel, I have been out of town for 50 days this year, and about 25 of those were in hotel rooms. I stay in lots of types of places, from the 5* Mandarin Oriental on a US$70 airline employee rate to a $60 penthouse two bedroom and living room suite at the lovely 1* Gold Spike Hotel. Look, this is a dive hotel located in an area where the cheapest we could get (on airline employee rate) was $200 a night. Yes, there are flaws in the room, like a rust stain on the mirror, old uneven furniture, only TWO towels per room, and old carpet and tiles. But the important things prevailed: it had a huge fridge that was cold and quiet. The air conditioning was very powerful and not very loud. The room was obviously well cleaned. We didn't see any roaches or pests. The linens were fresh and the mattress was hard; just the way I like it. There was no stench in the room. The water pressure was good and had hot water. That's all I care about. A bonus was the television that had 45 us channels with great reception (yessss, adult swim) and free local calls. The pool area is crappy if you want to sunbathe, there was only about 2 hours where the sun wasn't hiding behind some tower. The pool itself, is, interesting. There used to be a hot tub but they converted it into a smaller pool that has a waterfall type thing that flows into the main pool. The pool is DEEP (another thing going extinct these days...thanks, insurance companies) and COLD but smelled like those plastic kiddie pools that you fill with a garden hose. It just smelled like it didn't have much chlorine in it. The staff looked very surprised that I had jumped in it, and come to think of it, I didn't see anyone go into it. The staff, yes, were old. But I have no problem with senior citizens seeking employment. They all did their job well, and to be honest, I prefer an 80 year old bellhop than some 20 year old kid. I'm ageist, I know. I tipped the bellhop $2 to hold our two carry on sized bags, and he was more than happy to stand under the sun hailing a cab for us afterward. The checkin agent was also very old but was very helpful when he didn't see the reservation we made on Orbtiz 8 hours before checkin. He said he would deal with orbitz after checking us in, instead of making us wait while he did paperwork. He also checked us in 3 hours before the designated checkin, which is very rare for dive hotels. This hotel exists in a quickly gentrifying area and it would be interesting to see what they do. To be honest, I hope they just leave it the way it is, they have at least another 5 years without doing any renos. If you want a Marriott, go to the Marriott next door. This place is great if you use your room for sleeping, not for living, 'cause, y'know, there's a beach a block away. It's clean, it's quiet, it's comfortable. It just isn't aesthetically pleasing.

When we arrived the room was ok. The childrens pull out bed was not made up considering we arrived at 11pm. We had to wait ages for the bedding to arrive and when it did we had to make our own bed up. The bed was so unsafe it had metal prongs sticking out of it everywhere that my husband would not allow my children to sleep in it so he slept in it. Half way through the night there was an almighty crash and water dripping. My husband lept out of bed he thought someone had come in the room. He went in the bathroom to find it flooded with water. The air conditioning unit which is above ceiling above the wardrobe in the bathroom had been letting water out onto the suspended ceiling and had got too heavy for the ceiling that the ceiling collapsed. This was obviously not the first time this had happened as their was brown water marks on the ceiling. Lucky our clothes were not in the wardrobe. My husband mopped it up as well as he could with towels as we didn't want to disrupt the family sleeping. The next morning we told the manager and he seemed unconcerned as if 'so what'. All staff were unfriendly and unapproachable. Breakfast was comical as none of the staff spoke to you, just pointed at food and slapped it on your plate. We were going on a cruise so was very pleased to be leaving this hell hole. Unfortunately we were staying here after the cruise ended before we flew home. We came to check in for our second stay, 5 minutes before check in time. The unfriendly lady on the desk pointed at the clock and carried on with what she was doing. When we asked to have a room in the same area as last time as the view was probably the best you could find from the hotel we were told that our previous room was an upgrade!! Can you imagine what we thought our room was going to be like this time? The toilet in the 2nd room leaked constantly although the only thing good about this was that the toilet and bathroom was cleaned to the best the cleaner could do with room.

A walk out the door at the end of the lounge area brought us right out on the main street, and a right hand turn brought us to a Haagen-Daas AND a Starbucks, both with a high-speed internet access. So it was easy to get online. As far as the rooms go, the beds were a little hard for my liking, and the pillows were not great. But the sheets were clean. The rooms were in bad shape. There was bubbling of the ceiling both over the bed, and a lot of it over the shower--both were moldy. It is always humid in Puerto Rico, and I suspect when there is no one in a room, the air conditioning is off, thus the mold. But the countertop in the small bathroom was clean. We just stopped looking up. There was a free refrigerator in the closet in the room, and with a 24 hour Walgreen's directly across the street, we saved a ton by keeping drinks and some food in there. There was also a free safe in there, though we had no valuables. It was only ONE BLOCK to the beach!! When we had trouble with our air conditioning, they responded immediately. I mean NOW. Everyone was friendly and helpful. If we asked, they responded. We did not eat in the restaurant, but it seemed like lots of people came to the hotel just to eat there. We also did not swim in the hotel, though many families were and they were all smiles. I asked for extra towels in the room on the first day and Housekeeping remembered every day after that.

The 24 hour Walgreens is right across the street so when we needed band aides or a candy bar it was close. The rooms were cleaned everyday and we found everybody to be friendly. I did see a lot of security in the hotel but no more than I have seen at the Marriott or the Radisson which are on the same street. My grandson made a comment about the number of policemen he saw. You can walk the Condado 24 hours a day and feel safe. This was our first trip to PR since the No Smoking laws had gone into effect and I will say it was terrific to be in the Casino with no smoke. (I am a non smoker) I would stay at the Diamond Palace again. I have been staying in hotels and condominiums on the Condado for 22 years, had both of my children in Puerto Rico and live on the neighboring island of St. Croix. If you want a more traditional breakfast Fuddruckers serves breakfast everyday at 7AM for a reasonable price as well as the more expensive Marriot.

My family returned to our room in the afternoon to find the door wide opened and unattended while the maid was restocking her cart. When I went in the room, I found a cockroach in my bathroom! On each day of our 4 day stay, I found black hairs of all lengths, shapes and textures on the tile and weaved in to the towels. (Note, my family is all blonde...) There is only one lock on the door which was a bit sketchy to me becuase I always lock the deadbolt and top latch. The pool had plastic bags and other random garbage floating in it. The service, if you want to call it that, was pathetic. Please note, two beacons of hope for the Cubic Zirconia Palace was the maid on the 6th floor and the evening bellman.

While this hotel is cheap and in an extremely good location, I was extremely disappointed. To be honest, I can't see how some of our members even thought it was good? The only possible explanation may be that the 2nd tower, through the casino, may be slightly better. Certainly, the Member pictures didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look like my room in the older tower. Upon arrival we were allocated a room on the 6th floor in the oldest block. The room was musty & damp (extending to the bedding, carpet & Picture frames). There was mould on the curtains; the balcony doors could not be closed & looked as if they'd never been cleaned. You have to request remote controls - and when we did, it took several requests. The a/c was noisy (old time version - probable cause of damp). The sofas in the reception were dirty. The lady at the reception was abrupt. Half an hour after we checked in, we asked for a new room and were allocated to the 8th floor where at least it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so musty and the doors closed. On the positive side, there was a fridge in the room and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a free continental breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch it based on the standard of the rooms. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the upmarket part of San Juan called the 'Condado'. Sleek, close to the beach with lots of places to eat and posh boutiques. While are taxi's are always outside, there's a bus stop outside the Marriott charging only 75 cents to Old San Juan (B21 - runs until 9pm). The average price of a taxi is US$12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 14. Upon arrival, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a free bus service around the town. Would advise that you do the entire route and after that, get on and off at places of interest. If you miss the last bus at 6pm it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only short walk back to the bus depot. If you can afford it, go for the Marriott in Ashford Avenue instead (the main area where all the shops and boutiques are based). Alternatively try the Raddison \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although not so grand, appears to be clean. Our American friends stayed at the Best Western which they described as basic but clean. Our Peurto Rican friends, recommend the Old San Juan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which despite the renovations doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look to bad (but check the reviews). If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind not being near the shops and restaurants, try the Marriott Courtyard in Miramar. Although expensive for the few hours we stayed there ($190), at least it was of a high standard and only a few minutes to the port. While Puerto Rico is a Caribbean Island, in many ways, it's just like the States in terms of currency, shops and eating places. It also hosts the largest shopping Mall in the Caribbean - Playa de last Americas!!! Old San Juan is certainly a good place to spend the whole day - lots of historical sites and colourful buildings, shops and eating places. All in all, would advise extreme caution when booking hotels in San Juan otherwise you may end up disappointed. Take time reading the reviews and look at the pictures.

(Tip: This is a pretty lengthy review, so grab a drink.) The Diamond Palace Hotel & Casino was actually better than some of the reviews place it at, but I make that statement conditionally. First, know your threshold. If you're paying $89.00 a night for a hotel, how high are your expectations? Second, are you going to enjoy the island, or are you going to \"live\" in the hotel? Third, everyone has an opinion and is entitled to it, you do not necessarily have to agree. That said... The room was quite clean, the first thing I checked for was evidence of bed bugs. (I've become conditioned to checking for that first after all of my travels.) I searched for evidence of fleas and roaches as mentioned by others. Nothing. Next, I moved onto the amenities. The TV was as standard as standard gets. It took us 2 days to get a remote for it though. Not a problem for me, however my travel companion, she needed to have one. (Again, what is your threshold?) The balcony was my sanctuary thought the duration of the trip. (How much time do you want to spend in a room with your ex girlfriend?) Once I got the sliding doors un-stuck, it was awesome. We had a decent albeit obstructed view of Condado beach. (Tip: if you're on the front side of the building and have low tolerance of noise, get a higher floor, as the hotel is on the main strip of town on the way to San Juan, there's also a jumping late night diner attached to the hotel on the first floor.) All of the standard hotel gimme's were there. Blow drier, iron, board etc... The bathroom was clean, however the water never really got cold. (Trust me, depending on the time of year you're down there, you'll be looking forward to a cold shower or at the least a drink. Same goes for the water fountains.) The air conditioning was amazing at night, however it's not powerful enough for the tropical humidity during the day. The hotel itself has a bar on the first floor where a Continental Breakfast was served daily. We never ate it as I discovered my home away from home just a half block up the street, Starbucks. The casino is as standard as most Caribbean casino's get. With a handful of table games and nickel slots, it'll keep you busy for a mindless hour if that's your thing. Friday through Sunday nights they had live music @ the bar. Speaking of the bar, drinks are quite expensive. Think NYC club prices. Do yourself a favor and bring your own alcohol to the hotel and stick it in the room fridge. Unless you buy it from a \"major\" store and you're not a local you will pay A LOT. (Tip: they don't have Guinness anywhere on that island, I was warned ahead of time and smuggled in a case.) The convenience factor was quite significant. It is just a bit over 2 miles to San Juan from the hotel. Cabs to the center from there are about $12.00, cheaper if there's more people in the cab with you. The 21 bus will take you to town for .50. (Tip: Have quarters.) The Wallgreens across the street is open 24 hours, and it's easily one of the largest ones I've seen anywhere outside of NY. (Tip: They close the side entrance after 9:00pm) The beach is a short walk down the block, and it while it's not a glamorous hot spot, it's delightfully reclusive and you have the full run of the Atlantic. There are places to shop, and a few places to eat around the hotel. Check out the Buenas Ares Argentinian restaurant. If you're a wine snob, avoid the Portobello restaurant on the top floor of the hotel. Actually, avoid it all together. It's a decent Italian restaurant, but WAY over priced, and the wine, while the selection is deep, it's awful. Overall, 3 stars. 4 if you don't set your expectations to Marriot level. (Which is right up the street at double the price.) 2, if you're looking for a great hotel without spending any money. It is definitely my first choice to stay at again when I go back in March if I stay in the same area.

I am usually not very picky on where I stay as far as hotels go and I have read reviews about this place but I thought maybe people were being too picky. All the bad reviews you read about this hotel are all factual .It looks like the only part of this place they spent the most money on is the lobby, and thats giving them credit because the lobby couches are run down and dirty. Me and my friend shared a room along with two other friends who shared a room. Both rooms were disgusting. The carpets smelled and were dingy, we kept our shoes on the whole time, The curtains were not even of any material I have ever seen, the patio door for both rooms did not close completely. We had to request remote controls for both tvs, and when we asked they \"didnt have them\". The comforter looked like it was from 1960. We couldnt even cover ourselves with it. The shower head had mildew on it. Parts of the walls around the closet were cracked. The pool, wow, what can I say about the pool.I put one finger in the pool and I can smell the disgusting, rotten, infested water that noone ever even swam in. The elevator did not work properly, it would take about 10 minutes for it to even open up and this was not a busy hotel at all. The most frustration with this dump came at the end when the so called manager said we all owe $100 for \"San Juan City Tax\", we asked for some kind of document, or written receipt, to show this tax amount but he told us he has it on paper but doesn't have it at the moment. We called our travel agent who we booked the trip through and they had no idea what this extra tax cost was and argued it with the manager themselves. we refused to pay and he insisted that our cards will be charged regardless. He was very rude and didn't even have one clue about taxes to explain it to us as a manager of the motel. The only thing I can say good about this hotel is that it has a 24 hour walgreens right across the street, walking distance. And the beach is right out the hotel as well. But trust me, it is not worth staying here. I would definitly pay extra and stay right around the corner at the Marriott. They give everyone star treatment there whether you are a guest or not.

We stayed at the Diamond Palace Hotel in San Juan. As avid travelers and experience as a hotel manager, I would STRONGLY recommend everyone to avoid this hotel unless you are an experienced traveler and only wish to \"taste and feel\" the local flavor of the area. As an experienced hotel manager in the US, the Diamond Palace has a lot of potential, but needs some serious $$$ to make it an enjoyable place to stay. The Diamond Palace website is very misleading and gives you the impression that it is a 4+ Star Hotel. Nothing could be farther from the truth. We arrived in PR about 1am after a good flight via Atlanta from Colorado. Upon arriving, we got our rental car from AVIS, which was excellent. Good shuttle service, nice car, etc. So.... we got lost going to our hotel which was about a 15 minute drive, at 1:30am on a Sunday night. After asking a local who almost robbed us, we found a police car on the street, told him we were lost. He chuckled and said, \"follow me\". Lights flashing on his car, we followed him and in about 2 minutes we were at the hotel. He was very nice. We checked in. Small lobby, smelled like a public bathroom. Small casino, nice people. It is a 1960's type hotel. Kind of tired. Took the elevator to our room. Small bed, wall-mounted A/C unit which was noisy. Refrig, small TV, no remote ( you have to request one), tired bathroom, a view of other buildings and the pool. Broken lamp, bed OK, in-room safe had no lock on it. No coffee pot. Again, the room smelled like a public bathroom. There's some kind of disinfectent that they use there that makes everything smell like that. Great location a block from the beach. Walgreens across the street open 24 hours a day. Daily free breakfast served at the bar. Strong PR coffee, cold cereal, bananas and they will make you a sandwich of toast, ham and cheese. Maybe this is a local tradition, but two pieces of toast with slices of ham and cheese is not my idea of breakfast. Also orange juice. Casino small and mostly for locals. Slots and 4 or 5 tables. Not a good casino. They have a small restaurant which serves very average food. Kind of a scaled down Deneny's. They have a roof top Italian restaurant which we did not go to. All in all, on a scale of 1-10, we would rate it a 3+. The only good part about it is it's location. Parking behind the hotel which charges $10 per day. Not many creature comforts. No room service. Tired bar. On the positive side: location, friendly people (everyone in PR seems very nice.) Walgreens across the street. They have photo service so you can print or make a CD of photos from your digital camera. Snacks and everything else that a Walgreens has. Many restaurants close by including local PR food, Wendy's, Subway, etc. Next trip, we will stay in the Isla Verde area which is near the airport, has a great beach and seems a lot safer than the Condado area. Sorry Diamond Palace, but I was glad to leave after staying there 5 nights. It needs a remodel and upgrade, better food. Oh, they have a $5.00 lunch made by locals by the pool. Great local PR food. This was a great place for lunch if you happen to be near the hotel.

Secondly, when we made our reservations we requested a queen size bed and we were given a full size bed which seemed to be very small. We also complained and nothing was done.

Then on the day we were checking out the electric was turned off early in the morning and we as guest should had been notified days prior of such event so that we can be prepared. Due to the electric being turned off, we had no other choice but to take the stairs, which was a huge inconvenience. Did the person who made the decision to turn off the power really think this through before taking action and not worrying about the guest and the inconvenience they have caused? How about the elderly people that were in higher floors that had to take the stairs??? Really??? Was there any concerns with it being hot and maybe someone can get sick or worse. I have stayed at many hotels and I had never experienced anything like this. Having to sleep in the same room with roaches and no hot water was not my ideal vacation. I was very disappointed with my entire stay at this Hotel. I have made my complaints to the clerks at the front desk and the response was that is that being that I made my reservations on-line I would have to contact the website about my experience at this Hotel.

I was thankful for the few positive and/or realistic reviews that were written especially as it got closer and closer to my departure. I traveled with my mom and sister and both of them said that they would stay there again. I would too, especially for the price we paid ($65 a night). Since we needed to book 9 nights we were particularly budget conscious. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking for much, just a place to lay our heads in between all of the sightseeing. Each morning we ate the continental breakfast (7 to 10 am), which consisted of 2 cereals, bananas, or apples (note: the bananas go quickly), ham and cheese sandwiches (or just toast) coffee/tea, hot chocolate, juice and milk. We stayed on the 10th floor (in the main tower) where we had a partial view of the ocean and being so high up we never heard any noise from the casino or the streets. Every time we took the elevator it worked (however, once I day we would take the stairs for exercise) My first contact with the hotel staff was before our trip when I called and spoke with Michelle Rodriguez (assistant hotel manager) to request a room with 2 beds. No problems there. Since we were arriving in San Juan 3:15 am on Friday, I booked a room from Thursday so as to make sure we would be able to check in at that late/early time. I was greeted at the front desk by David, who handled our check-in efficiently and in a friendly manner. Throughout our stay the friendly doorman Juan also assisted us. Not everyone was as friendly or outgoing as the ones I just mentioned, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t encounter any rude individuals either. Our room had a small fridge and was cleaned on a daily basis (I think one of the reviews indicated that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t) and when we wrote a note to the maid service asking them to leave extra sets of towels they obliged. (leaving a small tip could have played a part in that as well ;-) I never saw any roaches, nor did I bring any home in my luggage. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true our room had a certain smell about it (not sure if it was the dampness in the air or perhaps our air conditioner needing a new filter) however, it was tolerable and a plug in air freshener definitely helped.

Around the corner is Starbucks and down the street there is an Internet caf\u00c3\u00a9, Pizza Hut, Subway, Baskin Robbins/Dunkin Donuts and Wendy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, along with the Latin Star restaurant open 24 hours a day. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the neighborhood was unsafe; there were times when we were out very late/early in the morning and while we always went in pairs, I never felt threatened. Also a block away (past the taxi stand) is the Condado beach. The part of the beach that is the most accessible from the hotel is nothing exciting. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some litter, some graffiti, some rocks (they made for good props in our photos) however, if you walk further down you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll reach the part of the beach that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better maintained. We rented a car for most of our stay and unfortunately I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak on the parking situation at the Diamond Palace because we parked on the street a few blocks away from the hotel. Based on my experience I would stay there again especially if I were traveling on a budget.", "Date": "December 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york, ny", "Title": "\u201cHow bad can it be!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "este77", "ReviewID": "UR4252559", "Content": "Where can I start with this review. Ok, I know where. The front desk was unfriendly and unwilling to help. We were supposed to have a double and ended having a single. Three people to a single was not good. The unhelpful front desk woman (blond hair for those that still decide to go), did not even attempt to look in the computer to see if a room was available. She just keep stating no rooms were avaiable. After standing there and going back and forth for about 20 mins we just decided to give it a try. Once we arrived in the room the bell boy broke the pull handle on one of the suitcases. The room was a TERRIBLE!!!! No bigger than a 8 x 10 room. The bed was lumpy and the footboard side was resting higher than the headboard side. Picture a one of those craftmatic without the matic. The tv was a 19\" on a corner of the room with a swivel stool. The balcony had a view of the parking lot. Mind you the sliding door did not have a handle and did not slide with any type of ease. The only thing nice in the room was the bathroom, but once we turned on the lights it was not nice. We had the lights off. We tried every single day we were there to change room offering to pay more. TO no avail. The elevators are slow and sometimes take so long to come up that its faster to use the stairs. The pool, ha ha, if you want to call it that was dirty and the towels they give you. They were salvation army rejects. None of the towels matched they were discolored and had bleach stains on them. The bartendar was not attentive to us at all. The parking lot had a fee of $10 a every 24 hrs. The restaurnt was not good either. They messed up our order. The only thing good about this hotel is the location. There is a Walgreens or CVS across the street. An excellent Argentinian restaurant down the street, Starbucks around the corner and the beach was a block away. The hotel room was also kept clean by housekeeping. we booked this hotel it was only a few dollars cheaper than the Radisson. Major regret!! We had some friends that were staying there and it was the Ritz Carlotn compared to ours. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The only reason we went with this one was that one of my friends stated \"How bad can it be.\" Trust me it can be very very bad. For those who still go the rm # I am talking about is RM 308.", "Date": "December 20, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Diamond Palace Hotel & Casino", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g147320-d242220-Reviews-Diamond_Palace_Hotel_Casino-San_Juan_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">55 Condado Ave.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Juan</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">00908</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Puerto Rico</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "242220", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/86/a1/86a1a98adbd13a26149d9c82778a2be61large.jpg"}}
