Tour buses all stop around this area too, so you are never far away from getting to all the sites. The room was spotless, very modern and good amount of space. Bathroom was a bit small, but again, modern and clean. Nice touch in the room was underfloor heating for the tiled floor. The deal included use of the mini bar (couple of beers, some wine, fruit juice, soft drinks, water, chocolate, snacks - about 40 euros worth) and a late checkout on the sunday.Breakfast was also included and this was great - hot foods (eggs, sausages, bacon, etc), cold (meats, cheeses, cereals, yogurts), breads, juices, teas & coffee - and fresh waffles which were perfect with some chocolate spread! I checked out the fitness site but didn't use it - a small areawith 3 or 4 machines, but there was also a sauna, steamroom and hot beds which friends used and they loved it. Word of warning for anyone going to Berlin for the weekend - dont leave shopping until the Sunday, because 99% of stores are closed.

The double bed was not a double bed but two twin beds put together, this was not so good because at night the beds slipped away from eachother. Apart from that the room was of good standard with a nice bathroom and everythinh else you would expekt from a 4 star hotel. Quite a lot of tvchannels to choose from, although 90% were in German. But we were not there to watch tv so that wasn't a problem for us :) The personell at reception was polite, serviceminded and helpful. We booked our stay via hotels.com , but when we arrived at the hotel the booking had not come through, don't know if this was hotels.com or NH hotels fault. Anyway the woman at the desk fixed it for us and we got the room without any discussion. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel because of the cost of it, I think it was 18 euros for breakfast. Much better then to walk outside and eat breakfast at one of the nearby cafees. Can recommend the one 250 m from hotel (don't remember the name of it), but take right out of hotel, then next right, and then right again, about 4 min walk. They serve breakfast for under half the price at the hotel. Would also recommend the Vietnamese restaurant Mr.Hai ,a 2 min walk from the hotel. We had dinner there 2 out of 3 days , great food at great prices. From the hotel turn right, walk to the end of the road and then at the right hand side corner Mr.Hai is. Also it was very easy to reach the hotel from Tegel Airport. From the airport take bus number 109 to Uhlandstrasse, from there it is a 2 min walk to the hotel.

The location is great, in a quiet street, and only a 5 minute walk to a s-bahn station and about 10 minutes to the u-bahn, with a lot of nice restaurants, shops and some grocery stores nearby. Our room was in the new part of the hotel, which is located just next to the railwaytrack, with trains and metro's running 24 hours a day. All rooms in this part of the building are next to the tracks. We didn't sleep bad because of the trains, but because of a strange loud sound (best described as someone sending morse-codes....) at several times during the night. The room is quite large and very clean. There's a minibar (with extremely expensive stuff in it, but quite handy for your own Beck's Beers), a quite large flatscreen tv, one normal chair and one relaxing chair and a big bed. The bathroom is quite large as well, with a nice shower, shampoo and bodywash provided (if you like a strong apple-smell). The sink, however, smelled very badly after using it, which was noticed by housekeeping because they closed the discharge the first morning but took no action to fix the problem. We 'fixed' it ourselves by keeping it closed until we went to sleep or left the room, but is was quite horrible. There was no bathtub in the room, and no coffeemakingfacilities, as said in other reviews and like said in other reviews the pillows are tiny. The computers in the lobby were out of service and wireless internet costs 9 euros per hour, which is pretty ridiculous. Breakfast costs about 18 euros, so we skipped it and enjoyed a lot of cheap and nice sandwiches, sausages and other nice stuff at the little kiosks on the street and stations. While we stayed in the hotel around new year's eve, the costs were pretty high (around 120 euros per night at the 30th and 31st of december, and 'only' 80 euros the night before and after,booked at booking.com, on the hotelwebsite itself it was much more expensive), but this is the case in all of Berlin hotels during this time of the year. However, the party at the Brandenburger Tor was great, and our Savignyplatz s-bahn took us there right away and back without any struggle, how great! Staff is polite, but we only saw them when we checked in and out, because of the fact guests staying in the new building can use the entrance in the parking garage and do not pass the reception.

All in all a great place to stay: one very small complaint was that the tea and coffee in the room weren't replenished.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new brighton,wirral", "Title": "\u201cfantastic value.fantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "shellyshoo", "ReviewID": "UR18526790", "Content": "We have very recently returned from a 5 night stay in this hotel.When we booked the rooms were only 79 euro'a a night.Upon arrival they asked us if we wanted breakfast at 18 euro's each.We thought that was a little expensive but agreed anyway. The staff here are very friendly and efficient.The hotel is spotlessly clean.It is very modern and decorated to a high standard. Our room was lovely with very very comfortable beds.It had a flatscreen tv and kettle and a mini bar and a free safe. There is a very regular train service that runs past the hotel but you don't really hear it, especially with the windows closed and at night it is very quiet. Breakfasts were really good with a huge selection and it catered for all tastes.The breads were lovely.The hot selection was hot , not luke warm compared to some other hotels we have stayed in.In fact , even though we originally thought they were a little expensive it actually saved us money as we never ate again all day until night time ! The roof top terrace was nice but possibly wouldn't cater for more than 6 people.The fitness area and sauna etc was brilliant. The location of the hotel is good it is very close to the main road and there are lovely bars and restaurants nearby.It is also ideal for people with walking difficulties as the area is flat.The hotel does have disabled rooms too. The bar in the hotel was surprisngly inexpensive too. Last year I stayed in the swissotel and this hotel beats it hands down and it is a third of the price. I cannot recommend this hotel and fab city highly enough.You will not be dissappointed.", "Date": "August 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT AND WILL DEFINITELY RETURN!!\u201d", "Author": "Travel_Lover80", "ReviewID": "UR17069025", "Content": "Loved it the minute I walked in.

A nice residential street near to a few bars, cafe's and all the main shops on the Ku'damm. Easy cheap access on the trains to East Berlin/ Brandenburg Gate/Checkpoint Charlie etc. Other attractions close by to walk to-Berlin Story/Nuclear bunker tour. Zoo/ Kaiser Wilhelm church. As we had never been to Berlin before we decided at \u00a3260 for 3 nights this was a decent gamble on a modern 4 star hotel. Glad to say it was worth every penny. I almost booked the Heckers hotel over the road for a lot more!! so am very glad we didn't! I would definitely reccomend the S-bahn if you fly into Schonefeld as the Taxi will set you back at least 35 euros. Get the Spandau line to Savignyplatz, it cost about 2 euros and takes 40 mins. Good views on the train of suurounding areas to East Berlin! The hotel was obviously new, very spacious room- Flat Screen Phillips TV, Well stocked Mini Bar, Good clean bathroom. Only let down in the room was that the double was 2 beds pushed together so make sure you specify a \"King\" or \"double\" when checking in. Staff were friendly and helpful- especially as the S-Bahn workers went on strike the night before we were due to travel home at 6am the following day. Always worth asking at reception for advice the night before!!
