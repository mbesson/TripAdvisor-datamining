{"Reviews": [{"Content": "This resort grew on me My first impression of this hotel wasn't very good I have to say, however, it did grow on me. It is an RCI timeshare, but they do sell vacant rooms out to other travellers. We were not on an RCI exchange and booked the room via their website. We stayed for 4 nights. Our room was upstairs ( Very steep) and was a studio appartment- it did have a kettle, microwave, 2 plates, 2 cups and saucers, knives and forks. They did supply us with 2 bottles of water 4 tea bags and 4 packets of sugar, but they were never replenished.The room was spacious with a fairly compact shower room and the smallest balcony I have ever come across, just big enough for 2 chairs, with your knees touching the wall. We felt that the rooms were very expensive 80 US$ ++ per night, plus a further 3% if you used a credit card, it did include a continental/ indonesian breakfast.Every thing was very clean. The staff were really nice and friendly and the setting was beautiful. I celebrated my birthday while I was staying there and I must say they really went to town for me- including a cake with candles presented to me during dinner by all the staff, a card which all the staff had signed, and when I went back to the room there was a beautiful flower arrangement for me. They made me feel very special.It is a small complex and the staff do go out of their way to try and make your stay a good one, entertainment most evenings, happy hour every evening, however, I think the rooms and the price really let the place down.", "Date": "Dec 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR295157974", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "westmorland"}, {"Content": "loved the peace and scenery We stayed at Bali Shangrila Beach Club for our first holiday to Bali . We came here through RCI exchange. It was a beautiful experience. The staff are all nice and friendly and very fond of Shah Rukh Khan!! One even told me that he wishes to marry Aaishwariya Rai!! The view of the sea and its islands from our balcony was breathtaking. The hotel was clean and also well kept. The hotel itslef was very scenic. We took some great pictures. The guests here were well mannered and friendly. There was an Australian couple who come to the resort for 2 months every year!The food though was not to our palate. There is an Indian restaurant nearby called 'Raja', which serves good indian food! so we were saved. The room was small and cosy. We were provided with an electric kettle and thus could make tea coffee in the room.We also got a very good car rented whose owner not only knew english but was extremely well mannered and a good person.Name - Indra Lesmanaph. [--]e-mail address - indra_trans@yahoo.comHe certainly makes sight seeing more meaning full and less expensive!All in all it was a great experience. I would recommend the resort for a nice quiet and peacefuil stay.Oh, by the way....forgot to mention the great boat ride, sunset from the sea and snorkelling. It was great fun. And you need not go anywahere all are there at the resort.

As said by others, this is not Kuta or Sanur, but a quiet, friendly fishing village up the coast from the noisier tourists. And that's why we choose it! Safe pool, safe beach, helpful and friendly local staff. Food choices abound at the BSBC and also in the village at unbelievably cheap prices. That's why we enjoy holidays to Candidasa with our family.", "Date": "Aug 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR963766491", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Challenger2"}, {"Content": "Small hotel high standard       A beautiful suite on the sea side", "Date": "May 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR838617230", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Ersano"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g312684-d616901-r22856243-Bali_Shangrila_Beach_Club-Candidasa_Bali.html", "HotelID": "616901", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
