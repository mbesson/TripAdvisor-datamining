Location is very good for walking to most of the main tourist attractions, although if you are looking for something close to the \"action\" then you may want to reconsider staying here.... Areas like Campo De Fiori will suit you better. For us we found the location to be perfect, off a side street opposite Termini Station so not too noisy. As a nice evening meal, i agree with other reviewers, you should definitely give Donati a go which is about 30 steps on your right from the hotel entrance. The room itself was very dated but suited our needs just fine, there was a bed which could be slept in (albeit slightly hard), there was a wardrobe which worked to store our clothes in (albeit it falling apart), there were plug sockets for us to use (even if they were hanging off the wall a bit). The huge mirror in front of the dresser worked as a mirror, even if it was fixed to the wall at a ridiculous angle.... My point is that if you pay peanuts what do you expect? Everything worked just fine but was by no means luxury. I emailed the hotel before we arrived and requested a room with a terrace, we were lucky enough to recieve this. Turned out to be a great move as the terrace was as big as the room, so in good weather (which we had) it gives you an extra living space. The hotel staff were all very friendly and extremely helpful, they cannot do enough for you. Previous reviewers commented on the breakfast, I would agree, pretty poor, we gave up after the first morning, and just grabbed coffee (ask the waitress to make it as the coffee they leave out is terrible) and some croissants and ate them on our terrace.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cspot on\u201d", "Author": "sue m", "ReviewID": "UR125669367", "Content": "Stayed 3 nights in February, room was very clean, comfortable & quiet, breakfasts were fab, plenty of choice, staff were lovely especially the helpful man on reception.

It is located close to Termini train station which was very convenient for getting to and from the airport (there is an express train that is affordable and quick to Fiumicino). The only problem with being close to the train station is that it's not in the prettiest area and it felt a little dodgy at times but one doesn't spend much time in the area while in Rome anyway. The staff were unfriendly, but we found most service people in Rome were. Check-in was unpleasant as the gentleman at the front desk became testy with us because we did not want to leave our passports with him (this is our rule and we haven't encountered problems anywhere else). He seemed bothered that he had to write our information down while we waited. The day we checked in the (tiny!) elevator was broken so we had to carry our bags up 4 flights of stairs but it seemed to work thereafter. Buffet breakfast was good. Air conditioning was wonderful in the sweltering heat of Rome. The shower was small which my 6' 2\" husband found awkward. There are a few (alright) restaurants nearby that are open until 11pm or 12am which was good for us as we arrived late and were hungry.

If you are lucky enough to be able to book in advance check out the major chains for offers, we paid 120 euros for our room per night which was far too much when I discovered we could have stayed in a really nice Mercure for less money. Location wise, its good, a very short walk from the Termini station. The entrance, is more an alleyway than a hotel lobby. at the back of which you'll find a room that is the reception. The staff there are very friendly and welcoming, I really couldn't fault them. Once you have your room, you can either travel up in the very small, very slow lift or walk up the very well worn stair carpets to the highest floors where you can also enjoy the exhibit of dust that has built up on the outside of the lift. The lower floors of the building are used by another hotel - the Corot - the rooms of which better live up to the 3 stars than the Rimini does. The room, rag washed blue painted walls with cracks, very small, just enough space for a desk and a double bed. No blankets on that bed though and sheets so thin you can clearly see the pattern of the mattress underneath. Even though I am sure the sheets were clean, I did not feel clean after sleeping in the bed which was not one of the newest. We saw several ants crossing the floor of our room and we were unable to get the air conditioning to cool. The furniture was worn out, with cup rings on the bedside tables and the desk. In the morning we had a lovely view from our room, a dirty courtyard at the bottom of which all the buildings connected to the courtyard kept their rubbish bins. That explained the delightful smell in the room later in the day. The bathroom was of a much better standard than the room though the hair dryer was dirty with old dried in lipstick stains and did not feel clean enough to want to use. There was no internet in the hotel although the Corot did have a wireless service, sadly as a Rimini guest we couldn't use it even though the two hotels share the same buidling. The breakfast was very good though it was a real shame they couldn't provide real juice in the morning instead of sugary, oversweet concentrate mixed with water. The breakfast room, like the rooms in the hotel was in desperate need of updating, it seemed that a radiator had been removed from the wall in that room a long time ago but they have still not got around to paining the wall where it once was.

Definitely SHOULD NOT be rated a 3 Star hotel. The hotel is run-down and felt more like a 1Star hotel... I think some of the Motel 6's in the US are in better condition! Another review commented on the elevator being small! They were right, the elevator barely fits 2 Large suitcases along with 2 people... but at the time of booking we were not concerned with the elevator as we just wanted a nice place to sleep and since the other reviews claimed the hotel was \"clean and spotless\" we booked this hotel. BAD IDEA! The reception area smelled damp and musky... and the man at the desk was not very friendly... we checked in at around 1am and were tired... so we didn't realize that he had kept our passports until the next morning. If you are not comfortable with this, MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR IT BACK. They are not very secure as the passports are siply kept in a cubbyhole and can be easily stolen. The carpets in the hallway were extremely dirty and worn down. The room itself definitely needed updating. The room was very dark, not very good lighting. The bed comforter has hairs that weren't ours! It was obvious it had not been cleaned... The sheets themselves were crisp and clean thought (or at least appeared to be). The wallpaper in out room was worn and areas of it had started peeling.... The washroom floor has not been cleaned properly as it still had hairs and dust in the corners.... the worse part was that there was a pubic hair on the wondow ledge next to the toilet! That was disgusting! But we were too tired to complain and it didnt seem like the man at the reception would have offered much help anyways and we were too tired to request a room change... we figured we would onlt be sleeping for 6 hours then keaveing anyways... The location is very good though. Extremely convenient as it is only a 5 minute walk from Roma Termini. I definitely would not recomment staying here for more than 1 night.... but if you just need a place to stay, like we did, the location is great. If you're here on honeymoon or looking for a romantic place to stay, THIS IS NOT IT!! It is merely a place to sleep that is in a convenient location. When we returned to Rome 3 days later, we booked at Hotel YES, which is also classified as 3 Star and the same price..... it is only another block down... if you can book the Hotel YES instead! It is the same price.. but FAR BETTER quality and the staff at the front desk are super friendly and helpful. Compared to the Hotel RImini, the Yes Hotel is a far better value.

The bathroom wasn't massive but was perfectly adequate and again everything was very clean and fresh towels, linen etc. were provided daily. Staff were (mostly) friendly and helpful and spoke good English, which was great given our limited Italian vocabulary! Breakfast was great - lots of variety - cereals, croissants, bread rolls, ham, cheese, toast and jam, loads of fruit juices and fresh tea/coffee brought to your table. One of the reception guys recommended a restaurant which is just round the corner - I can't remember the name of it but I think they will recommend the same one to people - which was a fantastic place, very good prices and really lovely staff. One of the biggest things going for this hotel is the location - literally 2 mins to the Termini station which has the main trains from FCO airport and also the metro which gets you to most of the main attractions. You can also walk to many places if you don't mind a bit of a walk; the colosseum is about 20 mins by foot. Overall, the hotel was great!!

Our room (604) was a decent size, bright, modern and comfortable. The bathroom was medium sized and very clean, with a good powerful, hot shower. The room was cleaned every day and new towels provided. As previously mentioned, the lift is quite small but remarkably quiet and it is better than braving the stairs to the 6th floor. There are the usual complimentary bathroom \"condiments\" and a hair dryer, but I'd advise bringing your own. There is also a small mini bar in the room. The shutters on the windows keep the light out so effectively that we had no idea whether it was day or night when we woke up. The breakfast room is large and bright and the food is plentiful and of good quality. There were four of us and we had booked 2 superior rooms, although on arrival only one room was booked and we were told \"all the rooms are the same\". By the look of some of the other reviews here, this may not necessarily be the case. One down side was that our neighbour was an early riser so we could clearly hear the shower running and toilet flushing. Ear plugs would be recommended for those wanting a lie in. Some of the hotel staff were pleasant and helpful, the others were no more than efficient, but we didn't experience any blatant rudeness. I found the hotel's location perfect for getting around the city. You can buy a Metrebus pass in a shop in Termini station (16 Euro for a 7 day pass) and use it for jumping on and off the metro and bus. There are many restaurants nearby and we didn't experience any problems with the area.

This hotel is a little walk from the station, but our room was VERY quiet, there was always hot water and with our little kitchen, we could cook or make sandwiches without any problem. The staff were very friendly and we received our wake-up call on our departing morning without any problems. Any problems (such as a broken key at midnight) was quickly sorted out and I am sure that if other difficulties had surfaced or had bothered us, I am sure that the staff would have resolved those as quickly and as friendly as the 'key' problem. That said, the hotel is far from the pantheon and the vatican, but for those willing to walk and wander, the colosseum and antica roma are quite near. Beware the taxi touts at Termini! Fortunately, we knew enough Italian not to be scammed by a driver who tried to charge for sunday (on saturday!) and for luggage (when we didn't have any) and then was resigned in good humour when argued with.

We arrived at the Rimini courtesy of http://www.romelimousines.com/ a (relatively) cheap but completely trustworthy and way of transfering from the airport. As is mentioned in other reviews the Rimini is near the main train station and although some might see this as a slight downside in view of the noise and some of the clientele that this type of area attracts I can only say that we experienced no noise whatsoever and the throng of people surrounding the area is no different to any other part of Rome. In short we didn't feel uncomfortable walking in the area at any time so the whereabouts of the Rimini shouldn't put you off at all - in fact it's possible to walk around Rome using the Rimini as a base if you don't fancy using the Metro (our feet gave in to this option after the first day!). Entering the Rimini through the main doors on the street brings you face to face with a small, clean, friendly Reception area and as is mentioned the small lift. We managed to fit ourselves and two cases in the lift at a squeeze so unless you have more luggage than Snoop Dogg's entourage you won't have a problem transporting your bags. Rooms are what I'd describe as 'comfortable' not large but big enough to enable a wander around the beds without having to breathe in or knock the TV off the dressing table. Our bathroom was clean, the shower was very powerful and water hot and plentiful - the ONLY downside was the hairdryer (according to my wife!) as the stream of air was luke warm at best. The hairdryer 'issue' was evident at breakfast where the damp haired ladies crowding around the croissant's wouldn't have looked out of place around an Olympic swimming pool. The breakfast area is on the 5th floor and there is plenty to choose from, Pastry, Meats, Bread and Cereals are all on the menu although waitress service isn't exactly prominent and to obtain a coffee meant getting out of your seat and approaching one of the waitresses in situ as opposed to them coming to you. Still, it's not an onerous task and the quality of the food available more than makes up for it.

The room was clean and the furnishing and fixtures we guess is under 5 years old.

Air con and shower was good, as was the fridge. Breakfast was also above par, including hot and cold buffet consisting of the traditional croissants, rolls, hams and cheeses, PLUS cooked eggs and bacon, great range of cereal and jogurt, REAL orange juice, and coffee made to order (eg. espresso, cappacino, late, etc.). Easy access to all sites via the train and bus network 50 metres away at Termini. Whilst Termini may have a bit of a reputation for being a little seedy, it was not as bad as we thought it would be. There are the regular winos but they are harmless, and the side that the Rimini is on we felt was more secure than the opposite side (the southern side). We felt that the service was pretty good all round. One day the staff let us use the iron and later they came back and ironed some of our clothes to give us a hand.

It is on the top floor of an apartment building, and is accessed by the world's smallest elevator (note for other reviewers: it's even smaller than the one in the hotel building!!)

The apartment is serviced every day, and the cleaning lady will also do your washing for you (an extraordinary level of service in anyone's books). There is no telephone in the apartment, so it is probably not ideal for business travellers - but for families, I cannot speak highly enough. The only minor point to be aware of is that the shower is tiny - I mean REALLY tiny, and water pressure is low - but these are minor when considered in context!! Breakfast is very good, and if you are out touring before it is served at 6:30 am, then the hotel staff will gladly provide you with a snack or packed lunch on request. Whilst staff may not appear too personable, they are very efficient and get the job done. The cleaning lady also works the breakfast room - she is quite the character!
