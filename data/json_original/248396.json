Hotel location is not really centre of town. No shopping mall, mainly commercial building. Only few restaurants and cafeterias nearby, one supermart within vicinity, and few retails shop nearby the hotel. Hotel lobby is small. The lift is even smaller which can only occupied max 2 persons with bags. Rooms are rather small and depends on what type of room you book. A real low-budget hotel and definitely a 'cheapskate' one. I personally do not recommend this hotel to you, not even if you are a backpacker, whereby you can see drugs dealer making businesses, prostitution around, beggars on street and hanky-panky massages centre. You'll get sleepless nights due to loud noises from fighting, screaming voices and cars speeding and passersby on the street (which can be loudly heard through closed windows). This is the worst experience I had and seen in all my trips... Only one receptionist on-duty (an Indian fellow - front bald head), No smiling face, moody and mood swing. I witness with my own eyes, he shouted loudly to every guest for key drop each time the guests out from the hotel, scolded the guests for making the floor dirty, showing angry faces to the guests for picking up extra copies of brochures placed on the lobby shelf and etc. Such a bad attitude staff. Why the hotel employer employed such a staff to work in the hotel with bad atititude towards the guests? Fire him!!! I never thought this would happens to me too, after seeing the guests been harrassed in such ways. I asked for late check-out for only 10-mins, he shouted and scolded me, \"No! cannot! You have to GET OUT early! If you late GET-OUT and I'll charged you 1-day room rate\". I am a guest of the hotel and I paid. Guests don't deserve this type of BAD service.... I've been travelling around the world, visiting so many places, I have not encounter such bad and worst low class budget hotel in all my trip. If you were me, will you want to stay in such hotel?

The hotel was a short 15 min walk from the West train station and we thought it was easy to find. We arrived early - 1 pm and the young Asian lady (sorry, I lost her name....) was very helpful and friendly spoke perfect english. We unexpectantly got right into the room. It was small, but clean. The bathroom was huge - 2 sinks and tub with a shower - however no shower curtain or any indication there ever was one. We were on the 4th floor - the elevator is old, small and slow and all we did was send the luggage up. The stairs are winding and a bit in disrepair. The room did have a small, ineffective AC unit and it was unseasonably warm - in the upper 70s - we wound up just sleeping with the windows open. There is a fair amount of traffic noise, but not something a cheap pair of foam earplugs didn't handle. The metro station was a block away and there was several cafe's and a grocery store that was opened fairly late which was convenient. We didn't see any hookers on the street, only one homeless guy who had set up a nice little cardboard apartment near the metro - he wasn't bothering anyone that we could see. Other than walking from the train station to the hotel and the hotel to the metro station/grocery we didn't do any walking around that area. Most of the sites were about a 15 min metro ride - and we did come back fairly late a couple of nights and didn't feel unsafe. As mentioned in other posts - the night desk clerk was absolutely useless - our TV remote was not in room and we didn't realize it until around 10 pm when we got back the first night - he insisted we did have one - so I just went downstairs and took his while he wasn't looking - so in the end I guess he was right. We didn't have a problem getting in after the doors were locked. The maid service was good - the room was made up and fresh towels every day. No indication that any of our belongings had been looked over. So all things considering it is what it is, in an expensive city it was an average room - I think they charge too much for what you are getting ,but this is Paris after all and everything is expensive. Would I stay here again, who knows - would depend on what I could find elsewhere, this was a last minute trip. If the metro was any further away then you would want to avoid this property. I waited to post this until the credit card charges had cleared - like others had mentioned we did not get a receipt when we checked out - it was the worthless night desk clerk as we had an early flight out. He stated I would get it in and email - that never happened. But no surprise charges.

They have air conditioning (which was great, even if the bed was underneath). The bathroom was immaculate with clean towels every day. Water was hot, didn't matter what time we had a shower. When we arrived,they had put a bed in for our daughter though i had requested a cot and they had it changed within the hour. The beds were made up every day. Its a perfect location for the metro, its literally round the corner and we walked to the Gare De Nord with luggage and baby and that was fine. We found the staff pleasant enough, if we needed hot water for the baby, we got it and we asked for microwave access to heat food up for her and we got that. The room could have been doing with a kettle, that would have made it a bit easier for us. The tv in the room didn't pick up any british channels but hey!! We were in Paris, we weren't there to watch tv!! The local area isn't great, we did come across about a dozen hookers within the first 15 minutes of walking but they didn't bother us. There's a supermarket across the road and eating places around the corner. We didn't take the hotel breakfast, felt the 10 euros for a continental breakfast was a bit steep so got coffee and croissants at a cafe across the road for two, much cheaper. So all in all, the hotel did what it was meant to do for us - somewhere to sleep. We didn't go to Paris expecting 5 star luxury, really felt we got what we paid for and that was fine for us. Who goes to Paris to stay in a hotel room anyway?!! Oh, the lift is an experience!! Never been in a lift so small in my life! Took us 4 trips to get everything upstairs when we arrived and we were on the 5th floor!!", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cRude Hotel with bad value for money\u201d", "Author": "beatentrack", "ReviewID": "UR32358022", "Content": "I have visited a number of hotels in Paris but this one is definitely the worst. We paid \u00c2\u00a3250 for two nights in a double via an online provider which had good reviews for the Hotel. However, when we asked for something as basic as a second bed sheet we had to negotiate for it and convince the gentleman at reception that we really needed it. The service was rude and unfriendly - one had this general feeling of not trusting anyone at the Hotel and we were waiting to be screwed any minute... The bad treatment culminated in us asking for a cab at reception and when it was ordered and we wanted to wait for it outside we were ordered (not kindly asked) to stay in the reception area. When we nonetheless left the reception area we were shouted at \"do not take another cab now as we will get charged for this one!\". There was no \"please\" or any other form of politeness but by that time we did not expect any of it anyway. The room was very small (but that is a common feature in Paris and no reason to dismiss a Parisian Hotel) and did not really have a clean feel to it although I have seen more dirty places. The furniture was cheap, old and a bit too colourful for the tasteful eye. Also, our bed was clearly only laid out for one person as it was not accessible from the other side and only had one bedside table. Funnily enough the bathroom had quite good size and felt quite spacious. The location is very central and access to the Grand Boulevard is easy. Of course the more one moves west on the Boulevard the better the area gets but you also pay more in the restaurants and bars and therefore we did not mind being in an a little bit less upmarket area which had its own charme. Paris has a lot of three star hotels on offer (even in this area) and you should check carefully where you are booking, this one is a definite \"don't go there\" from me!", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trinidad", "Title": "\u201cDefinately not a 3 star quality hotel.....\u201d", "Author": "travellingtrini", "ReviewID": "UR25690508", "Content": "3 rooms in 5 nights!

Second room had a single bed when we specifically asked for a double and the third room we got moved to, the phone did not work. I felt like a nomad and very unsettled, our luggage spent more time in the baggage room than our room because we were moved so many times.

We were exhausted. We arrived at the front desk, the very rude man on reception told us that we didn't have a room, and that we had been booked into a hotel about 15 min walk away. He didn't apologise, or offer to get us a cab at the hotel's expense. He just pointed it out on the map, and told us to go. We said this wasn't acceptable. We had booked a room at this hotel (through lastminute) and we wanted to stay we were. We certainly didn't feel like dragging our bags across Paris for another 15 mins, we were about to collapse. We tried to be polite at first. Surely there was something they could do? No. no. Then he started yelling at us and being very rude. This is a nicer hotel we have booked you into. Go there. Umm, could he not offer to get us a cab? Could he not at least apologise, offer to get us a cup of tea while we rested, and at least be polite and helpful?! No he screamed at us, as if it were our fault the hotel had double booked! While we were having this argument, another hotel guest came down to complain that the light in their room didn't work. In the 30 mins we were at this desk he made no attempt to do anything about it. After about 10 mins of being yelled at, but refusing to take it lying down, he offered for a plain clothed, dodge looking guy in reception to walk us to the other hotel. In the dark backstreets of Paris?? I don't think so, we said. He yelled at us again. Eventually, he left his plain clothed mate at the desk and walked us himself. He didn't offer us any help with our bags. When we got to the other hotel (which was thankfully lovely) he said \"You see, too close for a taxi\".

What a disaster! We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrive in Paris till 11pm so when we got there we were tired and ready to crash. The man on reception didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell us anything about the hotel and its facilities he only said that the lift was broken and had been for the last 2 weeks. He then told us we were on the 3rd floor and we had to lug our suitcases up the stairs ourselves while he sat and watched with a smile on his face. The stairs, mind you, are coming off the wall and I almost wondered if I was going to break the stairs completely with my heavy suitcase. Our room was all the way round the backend and the hallways were so dark we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even see the light switches which made them redundant. Our room was a dump, the bed spreads weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean and they had cigarette burns in them. Over all it was very very dodgey hotel and for 2 30 year old woman, quite scary. We decided against breakfast as the service so far was crap and we only imagine how bad it would be. The next morning we went out all day and came back to the hotel at about 5pm to get ready to go to Moulin Rouge. We needed to iron out dresses and went down to ask reception where our iron was kept as we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find it. He informed us that they had facilities that the pressing room is closed its only open between 10am and 4pm or something like that, and that it was basically too bad, I will state that all he had to do was walk up one flight of stairs and open the door for us, he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as using the iron outside of the pressing room hours is against policy, mind you when I say pressing room it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big cupboard with a washer and dryer and an iron and like a wood bench with a towel on it as an ironing board. We had to cancel our tickets to the Moulin Rouge as we literally had nothing to wear that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require ironing other than our PJ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. After a huge row with the manager about the poor service and that how can he charge 153 Euro a night when there is no lift and no iron is appalling. I said the hotel is nothing like what they show and state on their website and that they are scammers and that we want to leave. He said he would give us a 40% discount but after I argued some more, manage to get out of paying for that night even though it was like 6pm and he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to fill the room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to convey in short words and without pictures what a poor quality hotel this place is but I implore you, for 20 Euro more you could stay in the gorgeous Holiday Inn Republique which is only like 3 minutes away.
