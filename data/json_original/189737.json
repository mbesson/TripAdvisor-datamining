The room was what we wanted, two singles with bath, but the thirsd night the air conditioner started leaking on the night stand between us. I called the desk and they said they would have it fixed the next day. Put a bucket with a towel between us and caught the drip. The next night we came to the room and found the air was off. When we turned it on it started leaking. I called and asked for another room. None available. Would fix the next day. Next day not fixed, no rooms, I asked for a refund for the two nights without air and was told we would get one when we checked out. They sent up a fan, and opened the window to the noise of a busy street. Finally after three nights of no sleep we got a new room. No refund when we checked out and Quality Hotels through whom I booked the reservation in US was no help. Offered a free night in the US. London Hotel was $200 a night. Will never stay at a quality hotel again or anyone affiliated with them.

You can purchase a card that will cover the entire city or only certain sections, but as we\u2019ve learned from previous trips, Zone 1 is where ALL the major tourist attractions are located. Don\u2019t make the mistake of buying a more expensive travel card than what you really need. We had no concerns in booking with this hotel. It is part of the Comfort/Quality Inn chain of hotels. It is very close to the Victoria Train/Tube station and within easy walking distance of Buckingham Palace, Westminster, Horse Guards, Thames, London Eye, Downing Street, Trafalgar Square etc. Last time we were in London we stayed at the Quality Inn Kensington. It was a wonderful facility but decided that this time, to be closer to the main attractions. Therefore we choose this hotel for location and price. You get what you pay for in this expensive city. Other then the lobby, which looks recently updated, the rest of the facility is in need of a major face lift. The lift was able to fit 3 \u2013 4 people only at a time as long as none had luggage. The hotel was clean and quiet. A nice surprise considering how close we were to a train station and major roads. The air conditioning was feeble to put it mildly. We happen to be town during a very warm spell at the end of July beginning of August. The A/C was turned off or shut itself off (timer ?) every time we left the room. When we got back, the room was hot and the machine was barely able to cool it down after a couple of hours work. The bathroom was tiny but did the job. The tub/shower were raised so you had to watch your step when getting out/down from a shower. The room was small with two twin beds. The sheets didn\u2019t really fit the bed. There was a small table and two chairs in addition to the beds. We are use to having a little entrance hall in a hotel room when you enter from the hallway. This room did not have such a feature. You open the door and it bumps one of the beds. You walk into the room and sidestep the closet. Anyone in the hallway is easily heard. We went to the front desk to request a second key so that we could go our separate ways if needed. No such system. Because of the age of the equipment, the \u2018Key\u2019 is not electronic and easily duplicated for multiple guests. The key is reminiscent of a computer punch card. One key per room only. We were offered the option of always dropping the key off when we left so if we did separate, one of us could get back into the room without the other being present. Because of the locking system, and occasional noise from the hallway, I didn\u2019t feel as safe as I normally do when staying in a hotel. As with many hotels in England, we had to beg for ice from the bar staff so that we could drink our pop/juice cold in our room. We never ate in the restaurant at the hotel. It was a great location. Victoria station and environs have some nice little pubs/restaurants. The station exit closest to the hotel has a Sainsbury Grocery Store which allowed us to easily pick up fresh fruit every day. It is less then a 10 minute walk from the station to the hotel. The station is also one of the many \u201chop on \u2013 hop off\u201d double-decker city tour bus stops. Even coming home late after see one of the many London theatre shows we felt safe walking the streets/lanes around the hotel. We stayed here for 4 or 5 nights at the end of our trip. I don\u2019t think we would book here again. For shorter stays it might be a possibility. Keeping in the mind the minimal differences in cost for staying in hotels in this section of London, I don\u2019t think we would mind spending slightly more to stay in a hotel with a higher star rating. (We had considered The Rubens at the Palace hotel. We went there for Sunday Brunch. It is well worth the cost.) If cost is your only concern, then you won\u2019t go wrong with staying here.", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cNot to great\u201d", "Author": "eem65", "ReviewID": "UR20126751", "Content": "I booked this hotel as the majority of the better looking hotels were fully booked for the weekend 13/14 September. The main reason I chose this hotel over others was the close proximity, to the Apollo Victoria Theatre (Wicked is currently showing). Sizing up the location on Google maps was difficult, but in reality it is quite near to Victoria Station, which made travelling connections very easy, about 7mins walk away. The reception staff appeared to be of short temper, the only caring member of staff was the one with the badge stating \u201cin training\u201d. There was a lack of customer service generally. The hotel, I felt looked quite run down from looking at the exterior, but inside faired similar merit. The interior paint work looked ready for an overhaul. The curtain was tinged with grubbiness either from London smog or bygone eras of smoking within the rooms. The en-suite facilities were compact and felt slightly claustrophobic, the tightly packed amenities only added to this feeling. The bath had previous guest hairs in the bottom, which I found to be a little disturbing. The comfort of the bed was like a worn in brick, the mattress was rock solid in the middle and floppy around the edges, also in need of replacement. The bed linen, the skirt around the bed looked it also could do with a wash, like the curtains- grubby. The top pillow, looked crisp white but on arranging the pillows the 2nd pillow looked as if it had never seen a washing machine. The duvet was so heavy also looked much worn.

It appeared that many of the hotel employees spoke very little English so this made conversation about room needs very difficult. The rooms are small, but the features vary.

The free continental breakfast had a good selection of food, but the employees seemed irritated when having to unlock a door for someone or do anything above and beyond the call of duty.

Everyone was very helpful and eager to assist. I would stay there again. Excellent price for London. Five minute walk to Victoria Station and easy walk to Buckingham Palace. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, which we went to our first night there after long hours on the plane from the States. They had a couple of special items specifically geared for Americans. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the \"Southern Fried Chicken\" and my husband into his \"Chile Con Carne\". I know they really tried hard, I'm sure of it, but I have to tell you that it was some of the worst tasting food I've ever put into my mouth. Being exhausted from our trip and unable and unwilling to find another restaurant, I stuffed the chicken down my throat with great disdane and my husband tried to eat as much of the chile as he could but couldn't take it anymore eventually. What is funny is that the waitress advised my husband that the chile con carne wasn't hot--it was firing hot! I know there is reason to believe that the rest of their menu and cooking may be just fine, but we never returned there for the rest of the trip. Plus, the hotel restaurant was a little expensive. Because we had to leave the hotel at 3:00 a.m. in the morning for our flight from Heathrow, we decided to hire a cab because we didn't want to be on the public system with our luggage at that hour. I had read and printed out information on who and who not to hire for a cab. I had also read to check with hotel staff for assistance. So, we asked the hotel staff and they have a program with a cab company with only a set fixed price from their hotel to Heathrow. I asked them two or three times to verify with me that the price is fixed and under no circumstances will we get ripped off or surprised when we get to Heathrow. They assured me each time I asked that the price will never change based on any condition. Well, you know what happened--we got to Heathrow and the driver charged us $16 more. I told him about the price we were given at the hotel. His response was that he charges more for three o'clock in the morning. What a liar---the normal ride to Heathrow is one hour and we arrived in 20 minutes because we were practically the only ones on the road---the guy makes more money per hour at three o'clock in the morning.

But after that I finally arrived to this hotel, which looked ok from the outside, but when I walked through the front door I had a \"Oh hell why am I staying here\" feeling. The man working at reception was pleasant, but couldn't understand a word I was saying. So he gave me the key to my room and I was on my way, I eventually found my room after 20 minutes of searching. When I first walked through the door it seemed not all that bad, until I started exploring my room. The TV decided not to work for the first couple of hours, then the bathroom light would not work at all. So I decided to go out for a walk to see what amenities I had around, which wasn't a lot. When I got back to the hotel the TV switched on and the bathroom light also worked to my astonishment. So then i decided to get something to eat, which involved me trying to find the restaurant, which I did. Once I saw the menu I was astounded to find half decent food on it, so the food was ok, not the greatest, but not the worst. I went back to my room to watch some TV, then attempted to go for a shower, which proved difficult. First off the shower would not turn on, then when it did turn on it would not heat up, so I had to wait for about 20 minutes before the shower was even relatively warm. So I finsihed my shower, then I was going to shave and again had to wait for the hot water to heat up. The next day before leaving for my training course I decided to have breakfast in the hotel, so I had a full english breakfast, which was not a good idea. The beans were cold, the sausages were just about raw and everything else was disgusting. So I left for my training course. then before heading back to the hotel I decided to go to the supermarket and buy food to eat, as I was not risking my health at the hotel. The next morning for breakfast I decided to stick with cereal to be safe. Needless to say that I did not eat in the hotel the rest of the trip, which lasted four days, apart from my breakfast. It goes without saying that I would not recommend this hotel.

After reading some of the negative comments on Tripadvisor I was a bit apprehensive. However, we were pleasantly surprised when we entered our room, as on the table awaiting our arrival, was a bowl of fresh fruit, small box of chocolates and a bottle of water. White bath robes were also supplied and the bathroom contained all the usual free toiletries. The continental breakfast was excellent with plenty of fresh food available. We also ate in the bar area on both nights (Friday and Saturday) and the food served was excellent. The staff in the hotel were also friendly, so all in all, we had a good stay at this hotel, which is only a short walk to the Victoria Palace Theatre (Billy Elliott show). It was a great show and we will certainly return to this hotel if visiting the area again, as we consider the total cost of \u00c2\u00a3174.40 for a reasonable size executive no smoking room, for 2 people, for 2 nights (including continental breakfast) is excellent value for the centre of London.", "Date": "March 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201c\"Quality\" is probably the wrong name for this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jumbone", "ReviewID": "UR6823690", "Content": "The last time I stayed here I vowed \"never again\"; sadly this hotel was all that was available in the area at short notice (wonder why!?), so I recently had my second experience there. First time, the room was tiny and the bathroom grotty, with rusting pipes, and a window that faced into the courtyard, with cracked glass and no curtain or blind. This visit, the room was a lot better - a bog-standard business-style room with space to turn around in, a reasonable bathroom, and thermostatic controlled heating. There was no safe or mini-bar, but that's OK. The ancient wheezing lift (elevator) stopped working a couple of times during my visit, which was a little disconcerting. What really lets this place down is the restaurant. I've had the food in two contexts now, once in the bar and once in the restaurant itself, and both times it left me nauseated. First time the meal was spoiled by a badly conceived \"salad\" with canned ingredients, and uncooked potato wedges. Last night was particularly disgusting - a \"pizza\" with about 2 lb of spongy faux-mozzarella cheese loaded onto it (and cheddar stuffed inside the crust), with some kind of jar-based sauce, and olives seemingly picked from the cocktail bar. Quite revolting. The bar/lobby ambience is OK, but is dominated by a sports-oriented TV. It's in a good location, and the staff are very pleasant and friendly, but that's about all it has going for it.

The hotel itself is basic but has everything you need for a short stay, restaurant and a small bar off the lobby. The staff where very friendly and efficient at check in and check out. Now for the negative points, the room we had was tiny and the bed was not very comfortable, the shower room was very small and you need to dry yourself in the bedroom. The only good thing about the bedroom was that it was very clean probably because it would only take 1 minute to clean. The breakfast is expensive at \u00c2\u00a39.50 but the is a selection of good restaurants at the Victoria shopping center 5 minutes walk a way where you can get a breakfast and dinner at a cheaper rate.

Although there was only one lift it wasn't a bad size and it didn't take long to get to the 3rd floor. The room was small with the single bed in the middle of it (i.e. not pushed up to a wall) and the views of the square were, as a previous reviewer noted, rather nice. Clean white sheets and duvet cover, beautifully tidy and clean no-smoking room, great heating, full size bath and impeccably clean sink. Fabulous. Only problem was that there were nets (no curtain) in the bathroom! Also don't get too excited about the 'free toiletries' (although at least you get some) as they are sachets of bath/shower gel. Good breakfast, which wasn't expensive, and plenty of tables for one or two (I hate communal tables) and it was quiet at 8.30am. All in all a pleasant stay. I have scored this hotel quite highly because it had a bath (even though I had to bath in the dark), it was very clean and because reception was excellent.

I did not have any bad experiences with the staff and the location is fantastic (located close to Victoria station- easy access to the underground and various stores including a Sainisbury grocery store). One tip: take advantage of the lounge/bar area in the lobby. It was a very relaxed place to enjoy a few pints before heading out at night.

The room was a good size, unlike most London hotels I have stayed in on past occasions and the bedroom had clearly been decorated very recently. The wallpaper looked fresh and clean with new carpets throughout. Along with a white tiled bathroom with all new fittings. I visited London to watch Billy Elliot and was most suprised to find it such a short walk from the hotel. It was also very close to Victoria Station where my coach arrived and departed.

Staff at reception checked you in, in run of the mill fashion without even bothering to look up. The room was dark and dingy, a disabled room, I was provided with as asked for but on the first floor. Lift very ricketty you feel you are in it 5 minutes to go one floor. I arrived to find room faced over vents, air con, kitchens below and noise galore day and night. The room had only two lights a ceiling one and a bedside one, a prison cell would have been better, the bulbs must have been barely about 25watt it was so dark. The bathroom had an absolute stench, and I dont mean odour I mean STENCH that was a combination of complex pipework below the toilets and sink holding stale water.,and it was impossible to open a window, the light in the bathroom operated a vent but the stench was as rank at 11pm as it was when I had gone out hoping for the best at 4pm and it was no better. I reported it to staff on my way out at 4pm but it was not looked into, the next day when I checked out I was told the drains would be looked at the next day, SO WHAT??? I wasn't going back to get the benefit of it. Breakfast was terrible, warm milk that had been out in jugs since the crack of dawn to put on ceral, and breakfast arrived semi cold and arriving in semi-cooled grease. one man returned his fat-fest to have kippers instead but was snarled at by staff who wrote down that they would note down he had been sent a cooked meal and left it, because \"you can either have full english OR kippers\" not both, despite that breakfast first time round being rubbish. I wrote to complain saying that for the dire stay I'd have got a better B&B in London for \u00c2\u00a335 a night not \u00c2\u00a387 I'd paid for this dive. Four months later after two emails, two letters and a phone call I was not offered any rebate or a refund by way of another stay, for the stench of drains, noise, poor meals and supposed service. And was told curtly that We provide a good service for \u00c2\u00a387 and I should be grateful to find Quality accomodation. This is called the Quality Hotel, but certainly look somewhere else.
