We stayed there in April 2012. The room was clean and comfortable and the bed was good. Our one experience with the restaurants was also positive. The shuttle service is great \u2013 I got to the hotel by car, but used the shuttle to get to the terminal to meet my fianc\u00e9e. I didn\u2019t have to wait more than two minutes to get the shuttle, and we waited no more than five for the shuttle back. The same thing happened when we left. It was seamless. I did have to wait in line about ten minutes at the front desk when I checked into the hotel, but Yesenia was calm and gracious when I finally reached the desk \u2013 just what I needed after a long drive. The rest of the hotel service was uniformly good. The bad news here is the parking. I chose the valet parking option (rather than self-parking), and it did not go well. Although valet parking is $28 a day, the room is still a good value even with the added fee. But the service was spotty. On Sunday morning at 10:00 we had to wait 13 minutes to get our car, and the first five minutes were spent trying to get someone to take my claim check. Later that day, I asked for my keys so I could go to the car and retrieve some possessions. When I got to the car, I found it parked near the street, with the door not only unlocked, but actually ajar. I decided right then that I should have taken my chances with self-parking.

Like \"Peabody Traveler\", we stayed there the last night of a trip to LA so that we'd be near the airport, and we'd do it again. Front desk staff was very professional but friendly and made our special request to be on an upper floor facing the runway happen in a heartbeat - my husband loved watching the planes and the runway lights at night. We shopped in the gift shop, used the fitness center (son commented it was hot in there), and ate breakfast buffet in the Brasserie next morning -- not too bad of a price and good food/good selection - well worth not having to find a restaurant.

Our check-in was quick, friendly,and efficient. We really appreciated this because we had been up since 3am. We were immediately shown to our room on the Club floor. The room was large, quiet and had a view of the airport. We were well looked after in this hotel. There was no in-room safe, in fact none in the other Sheraton's we stayed at. A front desk safe was on offer. This is not at all convienent for overnight travellers. The club lounge breakfast was plentiful and often replenished,but no hot food. In the evening the club offered a snack buffet but no alcohol although it could be purchased. We recommend the Red Trolley Bus trip to the beach. A stop is ust outside the hotel. If you have time please do the hop-on hop-off trip to Manhatton Beach it is great value. We paid a little extra to keep our room for a late check out and the shuttle took us back to the airport. We would definitely stay here again if arriving and departing from LA. The Sheraton Hotels in the USA are nowhere up to the standard we have in Australia, Asia,or the South Pacific. They are sub-standard in a global sense. If you want better try the Westin Hotels. Club facilities require greater focus and the installation of room safes is a must. Thank you.

The other side of the hallway is much better and the view of the city skyline and Hollywood Hills is nice. The beds were extremely comfortable and the cleaning ladies were friendly and accommodating. The hotel doesn't offer free in-room Wi-Fi and the business center is small and crowded. We discovered a leak in the hallway near our room (water was literally pouring out from a ceiling light fixture), reported it to a disinterested clerk and the next day it was still dripping and the carpeting was saturated. We went to the lobby and reported it to concierge instead and within a half hour spotted maintenance attempting to find the source and fix it. But overnight the damage had been done and they had to cordon off that area. Made us wonder what other things get neglected. Oh, we know. The desk chair and occasional chairs in the rooms were filthy, the light switches in the bathrooms had enough grunge on them to appear never cleaned and there was mildew all over the caulking in the sink area. It's never pleasant to be washing up with black yuck facing you. The tiles in the tub area were old and needed to be replaced as well. Then there was the hand-held hair dryer that wasn't attached to the wall. It had sticky, dirty stuff all over it and was disgusting; really, Sheraton? For the price paid, we expected better. In addition, the restaurants were very expensive, free breakfast was not offered and the only cheaper option was Starbucks.

Amazing Service: The front desk staff was kind enough to allow us to store a couple of small items (GPS, LA guidebook, and other things we didn't need in Fiji) in a safety deposit box for the 3 weeks between stays (very helpful when you are worried about luggage weight limitations for inter-island flights). When our return flight was cancelled then delayed 17 hours (meaning we would not arrive in LA until 8am), we called the front desk to change our reservation to \"day-use\". Since the hotel was full, they could not guarantee a day-use room would be available, and it was past the cancellation cut-off time (meaning we would be charged for the night), so they granted us a 3pm late check-out to ensure we could get some needed sleep after our 11-hour flight.

The Shuttle picked us up from the airport without hassle, but check-in took the shine off things. The girl on the desk was pretty abrupt and unfriendly, she had no record of our request for late checkout or for a crib for our daughter, despite me having phoned ahead to arrange both. She acted as though it was a major headache for her to sort them out. The porter who brought our bags and the housemaid who eventually brought the crib were both really friendly and helpful, no complaints there. The room was really nice, clean and recently refurbished. The soundproofing was good, both from the surrounding rooms and from LAX nearby. The bed was HUGE and really comfortable. The bathroom was a little tired and had a few minor problems (such as the plug in the sink refusing to seal), but was basically okay. Our room rate came with included internet and breakfast, so I was surprised to be directed to a screen explaining the charges for internet when I went to check my e-mail. When I phoned the front desk they checked my rate and told me to accept and that the charge for internet would then be deducted from my bill. Something I should really have been told at check-in. Similarly, we went down to breakfast to be told that we should have been given vouchers at check-in. When I went to get them it was the same girl as the night before and the same surly attitude, not even so much as a word of apology. The breakfast was fantastic, however, and the serving staff were all friendly and efficient. We would have liked to have made use of the hotel's fantastic pool area, unfortunately the pool was drained down and taped off, no explanation was given as to why. We used the hotel gym which was great and then had lunch in the hotel bar and again the food and the service were excellent, nothing to complain about. One major complaint is that while my wife was walking our daughter around the lobby in her stroller to try to get her to sleep, she was hassled by a guy who had wandered in off the street and was asking people for money. When she told the concierge desk, they called security and had the guy removed, but this sort of thing shouldn't really be happening at all in this sort of hotel. The late checkout we'd arranged meant that we kept the room until 5pm, so I was distincly unimpressed to return to it just after 2pm (the normal checkout time) to find that the key cards no longer worked in the door. When I went tot the front desk to get it sorted out I got a different girl, but the same attitude. Once again, no apology was offered.

I also told her that it\u2019s not hard to have a list of rooms with pets so that these rooms can be properly cleaned afterwards. With a simple vacuuming to recycle these rooms for other guest is not enough. Dog hair is a trigger for some asthmatic individuals that can lead to a chronic inflammatory of the airways, which then leads to an asthma attack. Any excuse that this hotel gives me is unacceptable since management is well aware that hotel rooms are public shared places which should be sanitized and clean properly after guest check out.

It had a nice shower with a lots of pressure but, the old drain could not keep up with the draining and water pooled up deep when I was taking shower. The most disappointed things were customer service and airport shuttle service. The hotel shares some vans with other hotels near by to pick passengers up from LAX which is about 5 minutes away. Those van are making continuing loop between hotels and LAX. Hotel post that there are pickups every 15-20minutes. We were waiting at the LAX pickup points for a long time when we called the hotel. The front desk connected us to a lady at valet who really did not care. She said that the van is at hotel now and leaving soon to the LAX and it will be 15-20 more minutes before our pickup. First, it only takes 5minutes to the LAX, well OK it might have to make few different terminal stops but, do they only have one van? We end up taking a van for a long term parking located near the hotel since the driver offered to drop us off by the hotel. When we mentioned about the shuttle service at the front desk, the clerk did not care and brushed us off. Later we hound out that the van service was contracted out to a third company.

So I was already flustered from the taxi cab (where have all of the American taxi drivers gone?). Then I was told while checking in at 1:00am that although I had already paid for my room in advance, in full, several days ago, allowing Sheraton to make interest on my money before I would get to their hotel, I would still need to fork over $75 for one night in the event I incurred any incidental charges. I told the lady that I would be checking out in less than 10 hours to connect with my flight to Las Vegas; her reply: \"I cannot check you in unless I can get the $75.\" As an AAdvantage Platinum traveler (travel in excess of 50,000 miles per year), I would advise all persons to avoid this hotel.

I set my bag on the round coffee table and obviously someone spilled coffee, how they got it up under the glass I will never know, but putting my bag caused the fluid to come out in little bursts, I took a towel moved the glass and cleaned it up, willing to over look the incident. I go to connect to the internet and there instructions are very unclear, I was told I would not be charged but it asked me to approve being charged anyways I called to inquire and the front desk person said she would take it off. She Did it never appeared. Later in the evening I made 3 toll free calls which they charged me $6.00 for there was no phone card in the room indicating that so I called the front desk and they had indeed overcharged me by $4.00. It was supposed to be $2.00 for the first 60 minutes. Even though there was nothing to indicate that. So I get up to take a shower turn the water on and jump in because I saw a bottle I assume was shampoo, wrong there was a bar of face soap, no body soap and a little bottle of conditioner no shampoo. I was already soaked and had to make do. Honestly I expect a lot better from the Sheraton. So I called down to hotel services and the perfectly nice lady, said she could give me 1200 points on the Starwood program equivalent to $8.00 . At this point I said whatever and hung up. The problem is the staff was nice, the property was nice but these small issues are what make a difference between a superior class hotel and a average/poor hotel. I have had a bad streak with hotels lately because in this economy you expect what you pay for, I have stayed at a Day's Inn and were more satisfied then at the Sheraton and to me that seems very strange especially considering the huge price difference. To sum it all up, if you stay here double and triple check to make sure you ave all your essentials dont assume anything. My mark of poor maybe a little overstated, but it is not above average.

Check-in was pretty quick and easy. The FIRST room on a SPG member floor that they gave us was an adjoining room. And I previously had a bad experience with adjoining room where the neighbor was too loud with a family and the noise from kids was so prevalent that I couldn't sleep. So we asked for another room. The next room, on a non-SPG member floor, had a heavy smoke smell and it bothered my wife since she has a very sensitive sense of smell. The THIRD room, on a different non-SPG member floor, had a weird body odor smell. We almost puked when we walked in. So we finally gave up and said that we'll take the first room that was adjoining. The staff member called us about 5 mins later while we were settling in and asked us how everything was. I explained to him what happened and he apologized and said that he'd give us complimentary breakfast vouchers for one day. When the voucher was sent up, he actually gave us breakfast vouchers for our entire stay. That was a nice little touch. Under promise and over deliver. The breakfast buffet spread wasn't all that great. It had everything you'd probably expect except that the food wasn't that great. So we decided to skip breakfast on two of the days and gave the vouchers to ppl we saw checking-in. And just like everyone has previously said, the self-parking lot was not very convenient. it wasn't so much of a problem or an issue but just an annoyance that it's behind the hotel across the street. And a couple of nights, the lot was so full that we had to park almost at the end of the lot. And if you've been to the lot, you KNOW how huge the lot is. The lot isn't specific to the Sheraton. It's a park n ride for anyone and everyone so the LOT IS HUGE. And when you're coming back late at night, the side entrances of the hotel is locked/closed, so you have to walk all the way to the front of the hotel to enter. Yes, it's cheaper than other hotels like the Westin but very inconvenient. As for ppl asking about the airport/airplane noise, yes you can hear it but it's not noticeable unless you actually TRY and listen to it. It's basically sounds like the a/c or the heater just turned on or something to that effect. A few other misc. items... Good: Computer with internet/printer access, free Wifi in the lobby areas, nice lobby renovations, location is very convenient to the airport, close to rental car companies Bad: Bathrooms are dated and dirty Tip: If you're a SPG member, the SPG floor rooms give you free bottled water in the rooms. I noticed it cause I saw 3 different rooms and the 2 non-SPG floor rooms did not have free water bottles. If you really don't mind the inconvenience of parking, the hotel is a decent stay. I'd probably try another hotel the next time just so that i can compare but it's definitely not a bad hotel.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "san antonio, tx", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding customer service!\u201d", "Author": "viprjr", "ReviewID": "UR121707354", "Content": "Stayed here 12 Dec and really enjoyed my stay!

We had breakfast in the Brasserie restaurant (breakfast buffet). The buffet was fairly good for $20 per person. The room was a VERY mixed experience!

We did not say anything to the front desk because we were exhausted after 23 hours of flying that day and just wanted to to sleep. The bedroom area was otherwise nicely furnished and as others have stated, was large. It was fairly modern (other than the 1980s telephones still in use). Where I have to \"take points away\" was the bathroom. The vanity, mirror, and lights had been updated along with the rest of the room. But the tub/shower combo had the old 1970s yellow-ish tile on the walls, some moldy grout, and a VERY old fixture to control water and temp. I have had to travel to some remote areas of the State where only Best Westerns are the choice. It's the same fixture and tub you see in those hotels.

HORRIBLE SERVICE. NIGHT SHIFT EMPLOYEES HAD BAD ATTITUDE, NO HINT OF \"HOSPITALITY\" IN THEIR BONES, AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. I finally arrived at LAX airport after an agonizing journey that involved me missing my flight and my midterm the next morning. My flight was in 8 hours and after the horrible time I had just been through all I wanted to do was get a hotel room and get 4 hours of sleep. I was so distressed at the time that when I arrived at Starwood at 12 30am I was actually in tears, only to find that I had arrived at the wrong Sheraton and not Four Points (Gateway is more expensive and high-end). When I got to the counter and asked for the rate for 4 hours, the guest service agent looked down at me (I was still teary-eyed) and said in the most demeaning, least compassionate tone, \"It doesn't matter if you just stay for 4 hours or a whole day. 220.\" After thinking it over for around 10 minutes I was so upset that I decided that I needed the room and came back. But the two agents had already gone back into the room behind the counter and I had to wait another 10 minutes until they finally reappeared. Thankfully one of them had a little more humanity and seeing me puffy eyes and in tears at 1am, lowered the room rate to 180 + tax after a series of prying questions regarding my horrible night. I was so ready to head to my room and just pass out at that point, but when I got to my room and swiped my key (which was VERY far from the elevators and 7 or 9 floors up considering my time constraint) THE ROOM DOOR WAS BOLTED. An OLD MAN proceeded to come to the door in a BATHROB and informed me that it was HIS room, and that I must have made a mistake. Exhausted and even more upset at this point, I went ALL THE WAY back down to the counter, where only ONE of the guest service agents had reappeared this time. He was helping another guest check in, but even though he clearly realized that I had a problem (because I had returned after less than 10 minutes), and had little time left to spare, he avoided making eye contact or summoning his coworker until he was done helping the couple (-~10 more minutes of my life). FINALLY I got a new room key to my new room, and when I finally got into the door, despite flicking the light switch in both directions multiple times, THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN MY ROOM. I looked around for the cardholder to put in my keycard (because sometimes you need to plug in the card for the electricity to work), but no, the lights were just not working in my room. I was almost headed back down when exhausted and defeated as I felt, I walked straight into the dark room and tried switching on an individual lamp, which thankfully managed to turn on. I had a horrible night to begin with, but the inept and lack of service and the poor attitude of the Sheraton Gateway staff made my experience so much more exhaustive and awful than it had to be. Ironic that employees working in the HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY do not seem to know the first thing about being hospitable and are incapable of showing any form of sympathy (instead displaying downright rudeness) to a guest who clearly had been through a rough day. Don't even get me started on the filthy bathrooms... But needless to say I will never be coming back to Sheraton Gateway again.

I noticed online that the Gateway had been recently remodeled and had mostly good reviews so I decided to give Sheraton one more try. I'm so glad I did! This was one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. EVERYONE I encountered was friendly and accommodating, the bed was super comfortable and I loved the gym, pool and hot tub. Hats off to the entire management team and staff members for a well deserved 5-star review. I spent 4 nights there and didn't want to leave. In this review I'm going to address some of the things others brought up here on TA so hopefully you can make an informed decision. There is a free airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes making it fast and easy to get to/from the hotel. If you have a car, the hotel promotes valet parking. For self parking, drive into the hotel entrance and head straight back past 98th street and you'll dead end to a privately-owned airport parking lot. They allow Sheraton guests to park there for about $14 a night. You will need to pre-pay and then will get in and out privileges during your entire stay. Warning, the lot fills up on weekends (I arrived on Wednesday so had no problem). I noticed they were turning folks away on Friday/Saturday. There is 2-hour street parking on 98th but you'll get a ticket if exceed the two hour limit so be warned. Valet is expensive -- I think around $24 a night -- about $10 more than self-parking. There may be other parking options nearby but you would need to check with hotel staff. I arrived at 1:30 pm and being an SPG Gold Member was hoping I could get an early check-in and a complimentary room upgrade. In my recent stays at Starwood properties Gold members don't get decent upgrades so I was pleased that the Gateway recognized my status and upgraded me to the Club Floor (Top Floor, 15th - with Key Access only). I was able to check into my room early but immediately noticed that the air conditioning was making a funny dripping noise (which was pretty annoying). I called the front desk and they sent an engineer up. At first he said I would need to change rooms but he was able to fix the problem after all. I received a follow-up call to see if I wanted to change rooms and I declined. Great service, no problem. The club lounge was really nice, very large and had a great view of the LAX runway. The lounge has a good selection of fruit, cereal, bagels and juice for breakfast as well as complimentary snacks for dinner. Beer and wine can be purchased from 4-8 pm for a nominal fee. During the day you have access to the lounge where you can work, watch TV, read the paper or get an espresso. A computer/printer is also available for use at no charge. I was able to print my boarding pass there. The lobby/entrance of the hotel is really nice and features free WI-Fi. Lots of people were hanging out in the lobby with friends, work colleagues or on their computer sipping a glass of wine. Very fun vibe. It has a W feel to it without the annoying drunk/party crowd. For me, the highlight of the hotel was the gym and pool/hot tub. The gym is big and has a great selection of modern equipment. As for the pool, it was like I had it all to myself. It's also open really late which is a big plus! The pool area has comfy lounge chairs, large daybeds, FREE heated cabanas (great for socializing at night) -- the space is very relaxing and well thought out. My only complaint for the pool area is that smokers hang out there and blow smoke all over you. I wish they didn't allow smoking in the pool area. The rooms are nice, updated and have great beds. Housekeeping was really friendly and did a great job servicing my room. I only wish there was a safe, fridge and iPod connector in the room. The bathroom was small and a bit dated but functional. I too experienced problems with drainage in the bathtub (as others here have mentioned). The walls are pretty thin and the first night I got awoken at 4 am by some really loud folks in the room next to me. It was really annoying but they must have checked out as the next 3 nights were really quiet. I love that fact that the room was totally dark with the curtains closed. Pitch black... great for sleeping. We had an amazing dinner Saturday night at the hotel's restaurant called Paparazzi. It's unique Italian food with a twist. With the tip and a bottle of wine, it came to $190 for 3 of us so it was pretty pricy but the atmosphere and food quality was great. Our server was also very efficient and friendly. He explained several dishes to us and how they were prepared. Be sure and get the artichokes as an appetizer. Amazing presentation! I wish all Sheraton hotels were like the Gateway. I will now look for Sheraton hotels that have been recently remodeled. Many of the older Sheraton hotels are in pretty bad shape. They did a fantastic job with the remodel on the Gateway and I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. The service and friendliness of the staff really stood out for me. Congrats on a fantastic job Gateway...

It is reasonably priced, but it is further away than you think and it has some antiquated system of checking cars in and out so you end up in a long line. You can't win.

The hotel is located within visual distance of LAX and there was a free shuttle that ran often between LAX and the hotel. The checkin was quick and polite and I was in my room in minutes. The room was spacious and clean. I had two issues that spoiled the hotel experience: poor maintenance of the room and the continuing attempt by hotels to \"unbundle\" expenses and change for minor services. The concept of \"unbundling\" is that the consumer is willing to pay for \"extra\" services. This might be the case with room service or personal service, but has morphed into a hotel holding it's hand out constantly for services and products that are excessive in relation to the direct costs to hotel. As to poor maintenance one would have to just look at the bathroom. The bathtub failed the mold test where mold had been covered with more caulk. This failure extended to paint on the rusted door hinges and the light fixture in the living area that just fell out of the ceiling. Finally, when the shower curtain was installed the tile was cracked and remain not repaired In regard to the petty unbundled expenses I would just point to the bottles of water on the desk with a sign about their neck with \"Got Thirst?\" in large letters and in much smaller letters the pricing of $3.00. Oh please-it is a bottle of no name water at room temperature. The little sign might have said $200 for the room - \"Got $3 more bucks?\" In the same line of abuse was the demand for $12.50 per day to receive WIFI service- clearly an odd pricing model considering the relative cost to the hotel. Lastly I should comment as to the Valet parking scheme where for $28 one can park for 24 hours, but not be assured that a place will be reserved if you leave during the day. There are a limited number of spaces and I watched 2 drivers and a supervisor move cars on an evening only to question the true profitability of valet parking, Considering all of these factors I think that one should find somewhere else to stay when in this area. I have to believe that one can do better for a similar pricing with better maintenance and less petty expenses.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "N California", "Title": "\u201cThanks Diane.\u201d", "Author": "shrinkrap_10", "ReviewID": "UR117362039", "Content": "You rock!

I briefly told her about the flight and my immediate need for lots of water & a place to elevate my legs (my ankles were sooo swollen; we had a hearty laugh about that), especially since I had a dinner meeting with friends I hadn't seen in many years. Arlene was so SYMPATHETIC. She took one look at my attempts to be brave and upgraded me to a GORGEOUS suite. I couldn't believe it; when I walked in, I was floored. I stayed for an extra night, I loved the suite and its breathtaking views of planes landing. I also joined the Starwood Preferred Guest program, because she was so good to me. And I must say this: Although Arlene was STELLAR? Everyone I encountered helped to make me feel comfortable and welcome, including the discreet gentleman who brought my breakfast tray each morning. Why, even the shuttle drivers were delightful. The location was ideal for my conference and was very easy for my dear friends to find me. I am a neat freak (I always carry room cleaning products when I overnight) & found my suite spotless; I felt VERY comfortable in it. The free wireless Internet was fabulous, particularly because I attended a blogging conference and needed access at the conference and in my room! I am now considering a quick trip for my birthday.

We brought a nice bottle of wine as they have a corkage fee. Excellent waiter. Room was nice and clean. Love the white duvet and pillows. Bathroom a little small- but we were only there one night. I would not have paid for the club floor had I known what it was like. It was not necessary and we did not use it. All in all a great stay and we will stay again!

The lobby is done in trendy greys with patches of cranberry, the bar is attractive and comfortable, and the rooms all have brand-new furniture. I had breakfast in the restaurant, which was above average. The buffet featured smoked salmon (which, in my humble opinion, is the key to taking a breakfast buffet to the next level); though the East-Coaster in me couldn't believe they didn't have bagels (what is smoked salmon without a bagel and a schmear?) Hotel gyms are important to me, and this one is large, airy, and well-equipped with dumbells, about ten weight machines, and plenty of cardio equipment. The gym looks out onto the expansive pool area. One big miss: it's a crying shame that they spent so much money on renovations but skipped updating the bathtubs.

We are grateful and blessed to have been serviced by Diane Cheeks. As a result, my husband and I will definitely consider the Sheraton Gateway L.A. for all future stays when we are in the LAX area.

We then had dinner at the bar downstairs and as they were crazybusy again thanks to the influx of visitors from that cancelled flight, they accidentally forgot our order and immediately offered a 50% discount off our bill, which wasn't really necessary cuz we knew they were busy. Sure, the furnishings were a little old but everything was clean, spick and span. I couldn't believe how quiet the place was even though it was beside the airport and I absolutely loved the hotel's mandarin and mint toiletries. I wish they had more! Check out was quick, very friendly and great and my husband joked that they put up the Singapore flag at the lobby because I'm from Singapore. My only little gripe was that I emailed them close to 2 weeks before arriving in LA, asking if there's any vegetarian options at the cafe or around the hotel since my husband is one and never got back a reply. Most emails were automated so the hotel should look into this to ensure that guests with relevant questions could get answers.

Upon arrival to the hotel, we couldn't figure out where to self-park as our GPS was taking us one way and there were lots all over the place and it didn't appear to be clearly written anywhere. So, we begrudgingly pulled into the valet area, hoping they could at least tell us where that is and whether we could unload anywhere. They ignored us for the few minutes that we sat around trying to get their attention though they were not understaffed and there were not too many cars around. Finally we gave up and drove off, looking around for the self-park area which we finally finally found (behind the hotel). After we parked, we had to drag our bags across a massive parking lot into the hotel because it seems if you don't valet-park, you're an unwelcome guest. The gentleman who was checking us in, however, was very professional and cordial. He even got me to sign up for their preferred member deal. I wish I had made a greater effort to remember his name. Christian, maybe? Here, I thought, was where the true Sheraton experience would begin. ALAS! We got to our room and I found a man's black sock on the little armchair by the bed. Ew ew ew. I think socks are about 1 step above underwear on the nasty-clothes-to-find scale but still far below the shirt or scarf. Anyway, we were really displeased that the room hadn't been cleaned thoroughly enough to find this or the flip flop left behind under the bed (who doesnt clean under the bed?!). Well, we called to get housekeeping to remove it and they came quickly, sending a man and a woman, but when we opened the door, they looked at us as though we were supposed to bring it to them. No, thank you! I don't go on vacation to clean up after other people. The woman finally came in, picked up the sock, and on the way out threw us this condescending \"It's just a sock, you silly girls\" look. It's just YOUR JOB, not mine! I don't want to touch other people's soiled clothes and I don't appreciate you condescending to us. Also, the lids on the starbucks cups that they have in the room were dirty with some kind of brown stuff. And we didn't make a big deal about it, but socks? come on! On Friday night, we placed the \"do not disturb\" sign on our door so that the housekeeping who comes by early in the morning (as they always do) wouldn't bother us. We had breakfast and around 12:30 we left the hotel and TOOK DOWN THE \"Do not disturb\" SIGN! When we came back later that day, the room wasn't cleaned. We needed to shower and since we had left our towels on the floor as instructed by the little \"green housekeeping\" flyer, we couldn't very well use them again. So we called down for housekeeping to bring us some towels. It took them a half an hour to bring us 4 towels. A woman at the front desk (Jessica?) kept calling to ask us whether we had received them and apologizing when we hadn't. Come on, Sheraton. It's not like you had to prepare the towels. Anyway, we ended up having to dry ourselves off with those tiny washcloth/hand towel things because we were in a hurry. Very comfortable! The next day, around the same time, we came downstairs and asked them to send housekeeping while we were out. The white guy at the desk offered us these words of wisdom, \"Now, did you by any chance have the 'do not disturb' sign up?\" WHAT? THERES A SIGN LIKE THAT? WHAT DOES IT DO?! Of course we did! and we took it down early in the day! That's what people do! It's your job as the hotel to keep track of whose rooms were cleaned and whether the ones that asked to not be disturbed are ok yet. Am I supposed to leave the hotel by 8am just so it's convenient for you to clean my room? And why is it that every other hotel I've ever stayed at seems to be able to handle this conundrum while still getting my room clean? And if there were come kind of iron-clad housekeeping schedule, do you think you might mention it to us when we check in so we're aware of the Sheraton's idiocy and can be prepared for it? Then, the guy at the front desk is about to start lecturing us when he stops mid-sentence and just tells us that he'll send someone up. How did I know he was about to lecture us? Well, imagine a condescending face looking at you and beginning with the following, \"Well, you know in the future, you should--\" Yes, thank you. In the future we should book elsewhere is what you were going to say. The room itself was fairly well decorated. Obviously not thoroughly cleaned. The chair at the desk had some stain on the seat and we used one of the many pillows they give you to cover it up when we sat down. The curtains were kind of gross (the blackout ones) and definitely could have used a wash. The sheets were clean and good so we had no complaints there. But mostly, what ruined the experience was the condescending attitude of certain members on the staff that made us feel like idiots and I don't really think that is the goal of the Sheraton. I would have just ignored everything else if it weren't for this idiotic attitude and frankly, THAT'S what's going to make me reconsider staying there again.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cNICE HOTEL GOOD FOR AN OVERNIGHT STAY BEFORE YOUR FLIGHT\u201d", "Author": "gorgeouspaula", "ReviewID": "UR111230348", "Content": "Perfect for an overnight stay before or after a flight.

However, I was extremely disappointed in the cleanliness of the room, especially for such a reputable and high quality brand such as Sheraton (Starwood). The room itself I found to be generally clean, however the bathroom was the worst. There was a lot of loose hair in the bathroom, the mirror had water spots on it, and there were dirty towels hanging from the top of the shower. I basically felt as if the room had not been cleaned by housekeeping staff before my check in. I also felt like the front desk staff was not very welcoming. I felt like I was a burden to the staff by checking in. The welcome was not warm or informative. Nothing more occurred here other than an exchange of my ID, credit card and a room key. Not even an exchange of smiles. Even though I will not recommend this hotel, I would hate to say, \"don't stay here\" based on my single overnight experience. The hotel is very close to LAX and nearby office buildings. It certainly provides a convenience if you need to be in the area. It also provides nice views if you enjoy watching airplanes.

Joseph was extremely accommodating and apologetic and made sure to secure me a private room that was actually leagues beyond what I expected for the price I had paid through Expedia. The view was great, much nicer than the other LAX hotels I've stayed at and the amenties in the room and hotel are just super nice. The second time, Joseph remembered me! He very kindly secured an extremely nice room for me - when I went up and it was accidentally still being serviced, I went back down and he immediately accomodated me with another room that was on a lower floor, but was even nicer. He really went out of his way to please me as a customer. The hotel itself is beautifully set up and I have only had extremely positive and helpful interactions with the staff as they took care of my requests for internet and some packaging for my belongings. It's kinda weird, before I just figured a hotel is a hotel and I don't need anything fancy or a particular brand, just whatever is cheapest at the time.

Although we live in Los Angeles, we were having some work done at our house and so had to stay in a hotel while it was being done. Our insurance company gave us a choice of hotels and originally we had planned to split our stay between another hotel that was much closer to our house and ten minutes from our son's school and only spend the weekend at the Sheraton Gateway. However, after three days at the Gateway we decided it was well worth the drive (about 40 minutes in traffic) to instead book the entire 9 day stay at the Gateway. What can I say, the hotel is extremely well run and although it's busy it doesn't feel crowded or overwhelming. The lobby area is beautifully appointed and could easily be that of one of the trendier hotels on the Sunset Strip or in Beverly Hills. Nothing about this hotel suggests \"LAX\", from the incredible breakfast buffet, one of the best that I've had (and I've had many) to the five star Paparrazi restaurant where I dined on one of the best salmon in papillote that I've had, to the scrumptious chocolate lava cake. The pool is sparkling and well maintained and the cabana area is light and airy and so relaxing that I decided to take one day off and spend it by the pool. They also have an extremely well appointed fitness room as well as a convenient guest only complimentary internet \"cafe\" off of the lobby. Thanks to the management and staff at the Gateway I can truly say that the 9 days that I stayed there felt more like a vacation then any that I've taken recently where I've actually gone somewhere!

I have stayed at the hotel before and think it is one of the best in the airport area. If you are an aviation buff like myself, some of the airport view rooms have a great view of arriving and departing aircraft. The rooms are clean and very well appointed . The Club Floor is worth the extra money if you are arriving after a long haul flight as you can enjoy access to the lounge for snacks in the evening or continental breakfast in the morning. Free wifi is also available on the Club level. I have never had anything bad to say about this property however I did have a small issue with the bathroom this visit. Oddly enough I was in room 1565 both on my way to New Zealand and on the way back. During both stays (about 3 weeks apart) there was such a loud noise of air blowing quite forcefully through the air vent in the bathroom that the door to the bathroom had to be closed at all times. And when in the bathroom it was not only irritating but this constant flow of cold air that could not be controlled was very unpleasant. Especially when getting out of the shower. The bathrooms are definitely in need of some updating and this air vent issue needs to be addressed. My only other issue was with respect to the shuttle service from the airport terminals. For whatever reason (possibly just luck) it always seems as though the shuttle for the Sheraton LAX arrives at the airport shuttle stops much less frequently than the shuttles bound for the other airport hotel properties. Just an observation.

I asked for a \"downgrade\" as it was a waste of money for non-existing services, despite the offer of an appertiser in the bar (at 12.45am) and a breakfast coupon. When the key did not work for the third room offered to me and I had hauled my luggage for the third time through the corridors, the clerk on the front desk, new on the shift, took me and my luggage to the room and apologetically did her best to placate me with the offer of a $50 credit on food - so I ordered room service. The 3 rating is for her making up for the less able clerk earlier in the evening who just did not get it! This is a very convenient hotel and has a great lobby with great wi-fi (I think it was even free) and very comfortable and private armchairs and chaise longues to pass the time between check -out and a late flight. I checked my bags with the bell boy and took the Ocean Trolley to Manhattan Beach and Manhattan Village and would say it was one of the best $5 buys I have made - again a great way to get away from LAX for a few hours without the hassle of renting a car, and there are great cafes by the ocean and friendly drivers on the Trolley which stops outside the Sheraton and good shopping at the Village trolley stop.

It cost $95 per night. I really wasn't sure what I was in for so only booked one room for the 4 of us. I was able to choose 2 queen beds. When I got told the name of the hotel after booking I was a bit disappointed because this is really not a 4 star hotel according to Tripadvisor . However, I have to say that we were very pleasantly surprised when we actually got there - and I am usually really picky about hotels!! For a start, we caught the free shuttle from just outside the arrivals lounge at LAX - red stop. We only had to wait about 5 minutes which was great after a very long flight from OZ. It only took a few minutes to get to the hotel. Check-in was great, all the staff there were really very nice and helpful. As I had asked for an early check-in our room was ready to go at 10 a.m.!!! This was so great because we were very tired after not sleeping for over 24 hrs. The room itself was really nice - as is the entire hotel. Not super large but large enough for the 4 of us and 4 enormous suitcases. The bathroom is a little on the small side but good enough - with a good shower with nice hot water that doesn't run out. The beds are extremely comfortable. There is no fridge in the room but a coffee machine was there. Also, no safe in the room but provided at the lobby. Breakfast at the restaurant cost $18 per person plus tax for a full breakfast buffet - which my family really enjoyed. There is also a restaurant for dinner which we didn't use and a bar which offers meals. We did have burgers here one night and it wasn't bad at all - cost about $15 per person. There is also a Starbucks in the lobby but we did not use this. There are no other restaurants nearby. I did see a Hungry Jacks a few blocks away. For the tourists, there is an Ocean Trolley stop at the front of the hotel which takes you to Manhattan Beach and two shopping centres for only $5. This was a great ride - even if you don't get off. Really worth doing - highly recommend it. We also did a day tour of LA with Starline Tours which picked us up and dropped us off at the hotel. I'll do a separate review of this. The hotel also has a great (all new) gym which we enjoyed using and a heated pool which we ran out of time to use. Overall, this is a great hotel - especially for a short stay - not super luxurious (not like the Versace on the Gold Coast) but really very nice and very comfortable. The hotel has recently been refurbished and you can tell this \u2013 all new carpets, furniture and wall paper. The hotel did have a business centre in the lobby with free internet and free computers with printers to use - this was great. There is no free internet in the rooms however. One other important thing, there was no noise from the airport despite being just next door. Just to finish off, check out was a breeze and we only waited for a very short time for the free shuttle to take us back to LAX.

Check in was easy and check in attendant was friendly. The food in the hotel was so good! A little pricey, but that is to be expected at a hotel. We ordered food from the bar (calamari and salad), the balsamic romaine salad was one of the best I\"ve had. Also ordered pizza from room service which my boyfriend said was really good and I could tell he enjoyed it because he ate the entire thing. We also had lunch at the Brasserie, had a club sandwich and a salad which were also delicious. Parking was pretty cheap for being in the Los angeles area, about $12-13 dollars for the entire day with in and out privileges. Internet service was $11 which I thought was a bit pricey but we purchased anyways. The layout of the bar was probably one of my favorite things of the hotel. Lots of places to sit and tv's on each side of the bar to watch sports. Now, for the bad part...there were two bartenders when we were at the bar, and the older one was friendly and funny and took good care of us. However, the other bartender was really rude. He didn't make our drink correctly and when we politely asked if we could order something else instead because, he seemed to get angry and showed his irritation. We even saw him complain to the other bartender about us which I thought was very unprofessional. The only other negative thing, besides the bartender, would be the cleanliness of the bathrooms. There was a large dark brown spot/smudge (not sure what it was, nor do I want to know) at the base of the toilet and the shower. However, the guest service was so great, I would definately recommend this hotel. Our television didn't work, and witin 3 minutes, they had someone up to fix it. They also had someone deliver a room service menu within 3 minutes when we called and asked for one. The room service attendant who brought us our room was soo friendly and gracious.

Secondly, the king sized beds were so comfortable and each person had two pillows without having to ask. Also, liked the fact that there was lots of layers of covers. Some times you're too hot in hotels or too cold but just have to deal with it b/c you just have a sheet or a comforter but in this hotel there were several layers to the blankets. Room was large and had access to large and wide selection of TV channels. We didn't notice the airport noise that much. One downfall was that it is so far away from anything else but I guess that's what you get when you stay by the airport. They do have convenient and timely shuttle service to and from the airport terminals as well as a trolley service that that can give you roundtrip service to and from the hotel and near by attractions (Manhattan Beach and a few shopping centers + maybe 1 or 2 other places I can't remember) for $5/pp for those who don't have a car and don't wish to rent one. I did not try their pool or gym although both looked impressive. Did use their internet in the business center for a whopping $8/15 mins once to book a few things and confirm airline reservations. Housekeeping was good and hotel over all was very very clean. We got directions on how to take the public bus to Santa Monica Beach from the concierge who was helpful and gave us instructions on where the bus stop is (across the street from the pay car lot behind the hotel) and told us which bus to get on. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning - breakfast was a little pricey but that's expected for hotel restaurants. The buffet didn't seem to have that many options other than fruit and oatmeal/cereals/breads. Walked down to Denny's (15min walk) for the other morning breakfasts. Doubt I'll ever be in this area again but if I ever find myself needing a good nights sleep near LAX I'll definitely know where to go. Only thing I would have like to of seen in the hotel room that we didn't have was maybe a mini-fridge. Otherwise, awesome stay here, 100%.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery nice..easy walk to/from lax.\u201d", "Author": "travelerspring", "ReviewID": "UR83751120", "Content": "Very nice..easy walk to/from lax.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cIts got everything I needed and more...\u201d", "Author": "AlexRobin", "ReviewID": "UR83194957", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights and paid 106 total with all taxes per night. For this rate this hotel is unbeatable. It has 820 rooms, a pool, and all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. It is located 5 mins to LAX. I\u2019ll start with the negative since I only have a couple. The shuttle service is extremely slow and you will wait for almost half an hour when they say it is only 15 mins. So make sure you allocate enough time when you rely on this shuttle service. I wouldnt bother with valet service as they are soooooo slow and I feel are inefficient. Just park in the lot behind the hotel on 98th stree for $13 in and out priviledges. Service \u2013 this is what makes this hotel shine especially the guest services folks nothing is too much to ask, if they can do it they will accommodate you. I especially want to mention Diane and Merlie Pickett, these two ladies provided me with the best service during my stay. I even stopped by to meet them in person. They go above and beyond. Rooms \u2013 they are very clean and well appointed, modern d\u00e9cor and oh so comfortable beds. It is very clean and the soundproofing is very adequate. I am a very light sleeper and I did not have any problems whatsoever. This hotel is along century blvd but they have rooms that are facing 98th street where the parking lots are located this is the quiet side. Housekeeping never forgets to clean up the room even when I ask them to clean it up later in the afternoon. The room doesn\u2019t come with a safe. It also doesn\u2019t come with a refrigerator unless you request one and they would charge you for it. Even if the location of this hotel is by the airport if you have a car you can go to so many areas around it. Manhattan beach is 15 mins away and so is Marina del rey. If you plan to rent a car go with midway rental which is 2 blocks from this hotel, I had the best rate with that company although the battery died on the car on my last day. If you go left or right on Sepulveda blvd theres a lot of grocery, estabilishments etc I would definitely stay in this hotel again only if the price is around 150. You can get this through hotwire. Im not sure if I would pay more than 200 for this hotel. If you are looking for a hotel to WOW you this is not the one, if you are looking for a practical, clean, value for your money place then this is a great fit.

I don't think many people realise when choosing an LA hotel that this is remarkably near to the beach. There are great beaches the other side of the airport and just 10 minutes drive away is the nice small resort of Manhattan Beach with its restaurants and general seaside ambience. The rooms are large and a good standard of accommodation. The pool is nicely set for an airport hotel and the lobby with free wifi is spacious and comfortable. Bear in mind that there is always a cost to park when at LAX airports. However there is a large local car park next to the hotel, where for about $13 inc tax Sheraton guests can get a 24 hour stay with in and out privileges. Factor this cost into the price when deciding.

We called for more towels but they didn't bring them until after we had to be ready to check out (two of us dried off with the hand towels). Not major issues but irritating at the time.

As reviews indicate bathroom average at best; bed was actually pretty comfy, and the size of the room not bad. Thank goodness for the AC/Fan, as it for the most part drowned out the airplane take off noise. My wake up call assurred to me at checkin never happened...good thing I was up early anyway, and my appointment wasn't until noon that Sunday. Good thing I didn't have a flight. The next morning,I took the shuttle back to the airport, then to Avis to rent my car for the next two days. I drove up to the valet and told him I would check out in an hour, and how much valet was. $10 he said. I asked if there was any self-park, and he said there was, behind the hotel, and the first 2 hours was free. After driving around quite a bit, I finally found the lot, in the paid traveler lot behind the hotel. At check out, an hour later, I asked about the free parking for 2 hours, and if I needed a ticket validated. The front desk stated she did not know, and she did not have to do anything. As I drove out, I was charged $8.25 because I didn't have a white ticket that the valet was supposed to give me! This is unacceptable, and I was quite mad--mad enough that I likely will try the Marriott or Embassy Suites down the street. Very disappointed in this hotel's service and noise.

This was my first trip to Los Angeles and I was traveling for business reasons so did not have a choice on where to stay. Here is what I thought about the property: Front Desk Check In: We arrived before the check in time and there was no wait at the front desk. The front desk staff was extremely polite and helpful and checked us into the rooms early because there were extra rooms available. Rooms: The room that I stayed in was a one bedroom standard non-smoking room with a king bed. Each room had a LG flat panel television, iron, ironing board, small recliner chair, and a desk to work on. At the Sheraton, unless you are a SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest Elite Status) member, wi-fi internet access in the rooms is not available free of charge. Wi-FI is available but will be charged to your room. I am not sure what the rate was for Wi-FI in the rooms but downstairs in the lobby area, pay internet was offered by the hotel for a fee of $6.95 for 15 minutes so I would assume that the price points would be similar. The beds were very comfortable and I found the sheets and pillow cases fresh and clean. No problems there. Lobby Area: The Sheraton has a very large lobby bar which was open most of the day into the evening hours. All around the lobby bar area were large contemporary looking benches that had lg flatpanel televisions that were playing various programming such as ESPN, and CNN. The lobby bar area was quite big and could accommodate a large amount of people. Pool Area: The pool at the Sheraton was really nice. Outside, they had tables and chairs set up along side poolside cabanas. Also, there was a hot tub located adjacent to the pool. I did not get a chance to swim in the pool because the weather was too cold at the time of my visit but it looks like a nice area for a quick dip during your stay. Restaurants/Room Service: I did not order room service but the menu did have a wide selection of items to choose from but was a little pricey $$$ for my budget. If you wanted something quick to eat, there is a subway right next store to the hotel. There is also a full service steakhouse located on the lobby level but is also $$$ and did not go into the restaurant. Finally, in the lobby area, there is a small sundry shop in which you could pick up small essentials that you may have forgotten at home as well as snacks, juices and soft drinks, ice cream bars, and small Los Angeles souveniers. The Sheraton is a nice property if you need to find a hotel near LAX which has great shuttle service to and from the airport.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing service and resort like atmosphere at a airport location\u201d", "Author": "smpprule", "ReviewID": "UR63122698", "Content": "In times when the travel industry is lacking in the service department it is refreshing and pleasant to stay at a hotel that has exceptional customer service.

The upside: Rooms are immaculate, modern and fresh. Quality, plush furnishings. Quiet. Lobby is upscale and new. Outstanding pool, hot tub (under an enormous tree) and sun deck - they work hard to achieve a sort of West Coast/European trendy feel, which is no easy matter in an airport hotel.

I booked this hotel for about 5 nights during my summer vacation when I came back home for a visit. I booked this hotel through Hotwire, so I didn't know which hotel I would be staying in until I entered my credit card info and paid. It said 4 star hotel, but in reality the hotel itself was more of a 3 star hotel with 2 star service. However I only paid about $80/night for the room and I think the self service parking was like $12 a day or something like that. The room itself was pretty good, with large bed and contemporary furniture. One of the few problems I had with the room was the bathtub. As other reviewers have mentioned, there was the problem of slow water drainage and the tub was a little chipped around the drain. The other problem was that there was a door that separated my room to the room next door, and you could hear the family next door with their noisy kids, whenever they were in their room. Other than those things, I was generally satisfied with the room itself. However, the main problem was the service. At the front desk, the staff seemed a bit aloof and unprofessional at times. Quite frankly, some of them (even though they were dressed professionally) spoke and acted a bit \"ghetto\" and it seems like they weren't trained in proper etiquette. That wasn't the main issue though. The main problem was that I had requested a small fridge to be sent to my room 3 times. The first 2 times, I had called the front desk and they told me it would be there in 30 minutes. 1.5 hours later...no fridge. SO I called again and spoke to the same guy and he sounded surprised that it hadn't come yet and said he would call maintenance to see what was going on. Another 30 minutes passed by and nothing. So I went outside my room and saw one of the housekeeping ladies and explained to her my problem. She was really nice and on a walkie talkie informed another man of my problem, and within about 15 minutes, they had brought up the fridge and set it up. So, the housekeeping and maintenance people did a good job, but the \"unprofessional/ghetto\" front desk person didn't. I think he was just being lazy. I wonder who hired that guy and I'm guessing their criteria for hiring hotel staff must be quite low. The hotel itself was just ok. The pool could have been in better condition, and the fitness room was being renovated, so the temporary fitness room was tiny. The elevators do shake a bit. The only other comment I have was of the shuttle driver. He was a really nice and funny man. I think he must have been Latino and I forgot his name, but he made the trip from the airport to the hotel very fun. I hope they pay him well. However, I think the shuttle is not just for the Sheraton hotel but for other hotels in the area as well. But overall, for $80/night it was a decent value I think.

For the level of hotel, the price was hard to beat. Also, the decor of the hotel fits my personal style and so I loved the feel of the place. The bar was awesome and Shula's 347 restaurant inside the hotel was amazing (pricey, but amazing)! The beds are super comfy and the pool area was very nice too, the location was great since our vacation had us traveling all over the LA area. That being said there are some definite problems with this hotel, in fact, if I was someone who could afford their normal room rates, I would absolutely think this hotel was the pits! First, there is NO FREE PARKING whatsoever. That's pretty normal for Los Angeles but the Valet at the Sheraton is the biggest rip off I've ever heard of in my entire life! It's around $25.00 if you valet over 15 minutes!!!! If you elect to self park, it's $13.20 per night. Make sure you add that on top of your room rate when budgeting your vacation. The hotel messed up my bill which added insult to injury, they failed to charge me for my hotel bar tab but then charged me for a week of valet parking I didn't use. When I tried to fix the issue and was honest about not being charged for the bar tab, they blamed me and I had to deal with three different people to get it fixed. The bathrooms are a bit scuzzy considering the rest of the hotel and the TV's need to be updated. Also, it appears they have been having elevator issues for a long time now with only 2 of the 6 working so you have to take the service elevator. The brasserie for breakfast is overpriced and the service is super slow, I was shocked how bad it was in comparison to Shula's the night before. I recommend avoiding a handicapped accessable room as well. I would probably stay here again but It would have to be an even better deal than the one I got.

Housekeeping staff kindly let us use their elevator a couple times. 2. PARKING: $24 for valet, $12 for self-park. Self-park lot is behind the hotel across the street. This is a 5-10 minute walk in relative dark at night. Shuttle to parking lot is inconsistent. Can park on street behind hotel but you might get a ticket during day. 3. INTERNET FEES: $10.95 per day. True that internet is free in the lobby area (which is quite large). Otherwise, the hotel is fine. Beds are comfortable and room was clean. I can't figure out how anyone can stay at an airport hotel and then complain about hearing airplanes?! Bring earplugs or noise machine. Color scheme? Yes, kind of dark but this shouldn't ruin your stay! Long check-in line? I checked in very quickly. I noticed going through the lobby that there usually was no waiting at the desk, but a couple of times there was a line; that seems normal to me.

Period. I don't critique the front desk, bell-hops, porters, valet etc. at hotels because I typically don't interact with them for more than a few minutes during my entire stay so I don't let them affect my review of the room. If they go above and beyond, then I usually make a note to say something (to them and in these reviews). My reviews usually deal with the nuts and bolts. The Gateway is what you would expect a large chain hotel near a major airport to be - busy. The lobby has been re-modeled with mod furniture and is a comfortable place to lounge/work/meet for drinks. And, do not fear, it has it's own Starbucks. The rooms are for the most part spacious but the bath rooms are a little small. Speaking of the bathrooms, mine (on the 14th floor) could use a little updating and a new tub (it had some missing paint), however, I'm only in there to shower and get moving, so it didn't really bother me. Back to the rooms - comfortable bed, good work desk, average t.v. (it's 2008, let's make with the flat screen already!). I couldn't tell you about wi-fi costs or speed as I have my own card. And I sure can't tell you about eating at the hotel, because I have a car and there are plenty of decent places to eat within a 5 mile radius. The hotel is close to a CPK and their in house choices are Shula's Steakhouse - think Ruth Chris - and The Brasserie (continental?). Don't forget, I mentioned the on-premise Starbucks. If you book this room through priceline, you're getting a steal, if you book it through Sheraton for $250 or under you should be happy (higher tier chain in a large city) and you better be a SPG member so you can get the points.

By the time we got our luggage and then picked up our rental car we didn\u2019t get to the hotel until around 1am which is 3am Houston time.

This hotel is not within walking distance of many tourist sites but no hotel is within walking distance of all the tourist sites in the LA area since they are all spread out. We went to Universal Studios, Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and the Hollywood Forever Cemetery while out there this trip and none of it was really that far. Thankfully our rental car had a GPS device in it so we never got lost. Also traffic wasn\u2019t as bad as people make it out to be. If anyone thinks LA is bad try driving in Houston\u2026. At least California has banned the use of hand held cell devices while driving and I really think that has helped their traffic situation. I wish Texas would do the same.

For a club room this bathroom had mold all over the shower area; shower head coming out of the wall and the shower itself was so low that you had to bend down to have a proper shower ? Checked out the club lounge for breaky......pretty lame and ended up going downstairs for breakfast. Not a vending machine in the place or anywhere for that matter to get any munchies.......I was told if I was hungry to order room service ? I just wanted a bag of chips or something.

Very well maintained as opposed to some of the reviews I've read on Trip Advisor. Our room was pretty clean, the hotel public space was pretty clean as well. One note, it took housekeeping at least two days to notice some nut shells in a public hallway on the 3rd floor. I actually thought that wasn't bad because I notice everything (other guests probably didn't even realize the shells were there) and that was the only housekeeping concern that I had in a public space. As far as the room goes my only issue was the comforter, it had a stain on it but I never use them anyway so I just took it off the bed but wanted to wait and see if housekeeping would notice it and replace it with a clean one. They didn't so on my 2nd night there I asked that it'd be replaced and they responded very quickly to this request and any others that I had. Other areas like the hot tub needed to be cleaned as well and the elevators were very slow and probably needed to be serviced; experienced a situation where several guests including myself were stuck on the 1st floor because the doors did not shut properly, a guest had to pull the doors open to reset them. I never reported this incident. Though we had some minor issues service was great, the restaurant was great, the room ultimately was very comfortable, beautiful decor and furnishings. I would stay again and more than likely will soon. My biggest problem with the Sheraton Gateway is parking...yes we've read this before, it is a headache. First off, we did choose to park valet the first day due to schedule constraints...it was just convenient at the time. On the next two days that we had a rental we chose the Sheraton/LAX lot behind the hotel. It was very inconveniently located. My husband had to shuttle back to the hotel after parking the car!! Then, on the day we checked out I noticed we were charged for valet for 5 days instead of 1...we didn't even have a car on the last three days of our stay.

Along with what I ordered, they brought me 4 pieces of warm, fresh, crusty fench bread with butter. Also a tall ice water with lemon. Deff didnt expect that and it was very nice! And the french onion soup was not a cup but a hugh bowl! I was full just eating that. Yummy ceasar dressing too. Granted my meal cost me $35 but it was well worth the service and convenience.

The bathroom's toilet dispenser was nearly falling off the wall - the tub in the shower looked like someone had spilled acid in the base of it. The coffee pot didn't work and needed to be replaced, as did a light bulb and the tv remote batteries. Obviously they reserve this room for their \"special Hotwire\" customers! Now to the service we received here: the breakfast restaurant was fine, very cheerful, prompt, and the food was good. $40 for breakfast was a bit much, but it was our first day, so we weren't quibbling. Later that afternoon we tried to get a drink and food at one of the lounge tables, but with only one entirely inadequate cocktail waitress on a Saturday afternoon, we finally had to go to the bar to pay $20 for a vodka martini and a virgin bloody mary. Yikes! When we finally got our food, it was good, however - one of the best quesadillas I've ever had. The next night we ate at Shula's 347, thbe beautiful hotel steakhouse. Now, it was a Sunday night - not busy at all - and there were diners interspersed throughout the restaurant, but nobody sitting too close to anybody else. We were sat at a table for two in an otherwise deserted part of the restaurant - deserted, that is, until the hostess sat a man with his 5 year old daughter RIGHT NEXT TO US and then promptly seated a single guy who must have gotten his lobster eating technique from Darryl Hannah in \"Splash\" - yes, he crunched his way through the tail, then spit the shell out on the plate. Granted, his dining habit wasn't the hostesses fault, nor was the whining 5 year old, but her placement in a sparsely populated restaurant left MUCH to be desired.So while Dad and the kid worked thier way through $5 of mac n cheese, our $140 meal was ruined. It doesn't take much brains or training to spread the groupings around. The waitress forgot the wine, the bus person wanted to take our plates every five minutes, even when we weren't done. The food was good - very good, in fact. Such a shame their customer service left us with a bad taste in our mouths. Oh, and then there was the $50 room service breakfast of lox and english muffins (not a bagel, as the menu said) and a $12 croissant and cup of coffee. One shouldn't expect to get off cheaply on room service, but when you're paying those kind of prices, one should expect the order to be right and adequately substantial. $21 a day for valet parking was a bit much as well.

I decided to give Hotwire a try after not finding anything cheaper than $159/night - especially last minute. I found out that we were booked at this hotel and was excited after hearing so many great reviews. It was approximately $125/night (including taxes,etc.). Also, my husband is a Starwood Preferred Guest, so I assumed that things would go well. I called the hotel prior after booking to find out what kind of room we had, and that front desk said that we were booked in a non-smoking king room. The night of our arrival, we were exhausted from last minute travel preparations. We got to the front desk and I hate to say it, but felt like we were treated like second class. First of all, the boy at the front desk told us that we could not received SPG points because we booked through a third party provider. I was okay with that, knowing that we did get a lower rate. He then questioned us on how much we got the room for and told us that was a really good rate for that hotel. I told him that I called the hotel and we were told we had a non-smoking king room. He then said that we were not down for that type of room and that we were lied to and that they always say that. He said that he didn't know who we talked to, but they just say that. He then acted like he was doing us a huge favor by giving us the non smoking king. We then asked about parking validation or payment and he said that the hotel doesn't have self parking, only valet; but that the hotel just happens to be affliated with the parking lot in back. He said that if we are hotel guests, it would be $13.00/day parking rate. However, if I wasn't staying at the hotel, it is a $10.00/day rate. He then chided us, saying that next time, we should look at sheraton's web site and that we could have gotten a better park and fly rate, and that it really wasn't that expensive. By this point, I was so disappointed that he had decided to make us feel cheap and not worth staying there. I really was scared that our vacation was going to get off to a bad start.

The towels were large grey and white striped beach towels which was a very nice touch. We did not eat at Shulas but did use the bar menu to eat by the pool. The menu was limited but the food was good as was the food ordered from room service. The room service staff were delightful. We did not eat at the Sushi Bar either as we are not huge fans but it seemed popular. Breakfast from the buffet was good and plentiful and we felt it was very reasonably priced.

Website states free alcholic drinks in the club lounge (not often found in the US). We arrived to find a price list. When we brought it to their attention they removed the drinks!! The club room was not finished it was in a make shift hotel room. Shula's Steak house was closed, for 3 days. When I requested to speak the the General manager via his voice mail, he had a lesser manager call, he was too busy. We changed our travel plans to spend one night here, before our trip to asia. What a bad hotel! Room was filthy. Sevice was awful. Staff were incompetent. Management most likely the problem. Global Traveler recommendation. Did he really stay here? Stay next door at the Radisson, no experience there, but the Sheraton is that bad!!! Their website still offer free drinks for the club lounge.

I was forced to park in the hotel's off-site parking lot, where they charge more for hotel guests with in and out priveleges ($13/day) than someone not staying at the hotel ($11/day). You'd think they'd give their hotel guests a break. Since I am a woman and I was travelling by myself, I didn't relish having to hike back to the hotel late at night from the parking lot. They have a shuttle from the parking lot to the hotel, but you still have to sit at the shuttle stop for quite a while until the shuttle comes. The second night I stayed, the valet parking was also full. The reception check-in was extremely rude. I had purchased the hotel stay on Priceline and this proved that internet-paying guests are treated poorly. He said he couldn't guarantee a non-smoking room since I had booked through the internet. I told him that there was no way I could have a smoking room since 1) I'm allergic to smoke and 2) I'm 4 months pregnant. He \"happened to have two non-smoking rooms left.\" When I arrived at the room, the carpets were damp as if they had just been cleaned. When I called to complain, they said they'd send someone up to dry them. Housekeeping came up with a tiny fan that was meant to somehow dry the entire room of its damp floors. I told them I didn't think that would work and asked if they could just set down towels. I ordered room service and both the woman who took my order and the delivery man were very friendly and professional. After the bad experience I had so far, I really appreciated it. The room was clean, but definitely no-frills. Very few amenities -- not even bottled water in the room or a mini bar. The bathroom was looking very worn -- cracks in the tub and the the sink did not drain well. The next morning I had breakfast at \"The Brasserie.\" The service was very good. Besides their food service, this hotel should make a lot of improvements before it can call itself a 4-Star hotel.", "Date": "October 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood stay at the airport!\u201d", "Author": "usafan", "ReviewID": "UR3996737", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Gateway. Large, clean rooms and the beds were very comfortable. They were the best beds during our 21-day round trip. The only negative i can say about this hotel is the parking situation. They have no self parking lot, only valet. They have no check in parking available, so you have to carry your luggage from the nearby airport parking lot or discuss with the valet parking personal to get 5 minutes to unload. The whirlpool also wasn't very good. So, choose this hotel as an airport hotel for the night before or after your flight, for that it couldn't be better.

The parking here is a nightmare, valet is expensive and although self parking is cheaper (13 dollars per day) it is annoying. Many times we grabbed the last or next to the last spot. There were several times when there was a long line waiting to get out and the situation became disorganized. Another problem is housekeeping, it took them forever to do our room, it was 1:30 in the afternoon and it still wasn't done. The elevators were broken during our time there, it wasn't that bad of a problem for us because we were on the third floor, but it could become a big problem for someone on a higher floor. Another thing I didn't like about this place was that the shower head was too low and I nearly hit my head on it a couple of times and I'm only 5-6. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the pool area was very good as well. What's good is you can order drinks and take them out by the pool. The pool tended to get crowded in the afternoon.The room service food was good and I also liked the bar there too. One thing about room service that I really liked was it is 24 hours, which is great when you are looking for something to eat at midnight. Shula's was expensive but the steak was good.

After reading the rave reviews here I decided to give the Sheraton Gateway a try. I had enough Starwood points for both nights from a bad experience at the Sheraton Towers in NYC so my hopes were not high even with the good reviews. The shuttle bus arrived immediately. But things did not start off well once at the hotel because I arrived at around 10 AM from the east coast and my room, or any other room, was not ready. I realize check in is not until 3 PM but I have never had to wait anywhere else and I had to watch as numerous Southwest pilots and flight attendents got rooms. I didn't get a room until after 2 PM after dozing in the lobby, not a pleasant situation. But when I finally got to my room it more than made up for the wait. What beautiful decor, exactly as on their website, although my room seemed even larger. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and I never heard a plane although there was some hallway noise. The shuttle arrived promptly in the very early morning and, as Starbucks was not open yet, there was coffee by the front desk. On the way back the shuttle was again prompt and I was able to check in early, exhausted from the long flight. The next morning I was thrilled by the huge breakfast buffet after many mornings of terrible Chinese breakfasts and literally stuffed myself. Everything was wonderful and the wait staff was superb. While not cheap, I think it was an excellent value for the large selection. I've stayed at the Marriott Courtyard a few doors away before for business and what a difference! I'll never go back there now. Hard to believe this is an airport hotel and I look forward to coming back, even as a paying guest. Also, believe it or not, I plan on copying some of the room decor elements and the sophisticated color scheme for a guest room at home, it was really that nice. The only thing I didn't like about the room was the lack of free high speed internet access. In today's world this should be included in the price of the room, especially at the airport.
