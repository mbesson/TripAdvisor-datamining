Our room had a window and the bathroom was quite spacious based on Singapore standards. Still very basic but with the rate we paid, was value for money. The bed was okay, though the sheets could be better. There was a safe in the room and a closet for our things. We were provided bottled water daily. We did not have breakfast with our booking so I cannot rate the meals in this facility. TV channels were just 4. Local channels with 1 channel in English. Do not expect cable here. There was free wifi in our room and at the lobby. This is quite an old hotel but will do if my only objective is to shop my heart out and be out most of the day.

Convenient city bus-stop just in front of Concorde Hotel, which is just 3 minutes walk away. My room was super spacious and overlook the beautiful Palace Park, and also the busy highway. For the noise sensitive, it is good to request for a room that overlook the other side, facing Concorde Hotel I believe.

The service was practically good because the place always looked clean and the staff is very friendly.

I have marked this as above average for the price you pay and where it is located in Singapore. I stayed here with my family (five with three kids under ten) for five nights. The family room is good and spacious although we did have a roll away with two double beds. It is hard to locate one room for five people in Singapore so this suited us well as we were out all day sightseeing anyway. The room was plenty big enough to take all our luggage and for the kids to spread things around. It was clean, had all the things we needed and is well located to both Orchard Road and Dhoby Ghaut MRT. In addition, there is a great mini hawker market at the around the corner at the back and a foodcourt. As expected for the price, there is no real breakfast or meals, but who cares; Singapore is known for its food, so it is an opportunity to get out and try something local. There are some really cheap hotels in some really 'interesting' places in Singapore. This is not one of them. This is in a great spot that is safe for families and if you are just there for a short stay more than satisfactory but realise that it is a basic hotel and that is why you are paying less. We were on the second (third?) floor family room that faced Kramat Road. Road noise was reasonably loud, but if this bothers you, bring some ear plugs. I've also previously stayed in a room at the rear of the hotel and this was quiet, but dark (faced a wall).", "Date": "October 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Makati City", "Title": "\u201cSupremely Satisfied\u201d", "Author": "g-child", "ReviewID": "UR19406282", "Content": "My family and I just arrived from our five day trip to Singapore and stayed at the hotel supreme near orchard road..i was really satisfied on how courteous the people from the front desk were..We arrived at around 11:30am and were allowed to have an early check in.They gave us the rm.301 w/c was a family room because there were 4 of us all adults..the room was big and clean even the bathroom was well maintained..The location was perfect just a 5min walk to orchard road and a 10min walk to the nearest mrt station..also a 5min walk to a near hawker centre for cheap food...overall I would recommend this hotel to people who want to stay in a hotel in Singapore with a budget not compromising quality..", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mandaue, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommended\u201d", "Author": "BobJoe2", "ReviewID": "UR16504530", "Content": "We just returned from Hotel Supreme in Singapore.

I have to precise that my husband and I lived in pretty remote countries (Siberia, west & central Africa, ...) and sincerely if we had arrived earlier in the evening we would have left for another hotel.

I went back to the reception to change for a non smoking room and the weird, rude, \"not willing to help\" staff told me that in fact that was a non-smoking room !!! seriously ! We literally spent the night in an ashtray. And even for ex-smokers like us it was very difficult to sleep in this stinky room. To summarize: - the staff lobby staff is incompetent and rude. They just care about you paying cash or by credit card... - the room was small, depressing, uncomfortable, dark and so so stinky - the location could have been fine if only the hotel was not that close to a very busy express way It's far from being a 3 stars hotel and the only reason you have to stay there is if you need a chock therapy to quit smoking.
