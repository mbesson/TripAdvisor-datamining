We only booked this hotel when the Sandman was full. I guess that's what you get for writing a positive review :) Caution: there is another Best Western, which also calls itself Best Western Plus Airport, on Dixie Rd. This review is about the one on Eglinton Avenue. But this hotel won us over and we now have a choice of two hotels with restaurant, which is very useful in this thruway desert zone around Pearson airport, but if you get there after 10 p.m., it's pizza only, delivery only. Nothing else for miles. The room was smaller than most (your roommate will have to make you move if you are working at the desk and (s)he wants to get to the other chair or the window), furnished in the requisite dark wood and silver accents. There is a work-size desk (the free wifi worked beautifully), two excellent beds, a bigger than average fridge with good-size freezer compartment (we take frozen food on our trips to the islands, with mixed result at security: some agents will let it go if it is frozen solid) and good size flat=screen TV. On the other hand, drawer space is dismal (three small one next to the fridge), and the clothes closet is adequate, not one inch more. Bathroom is fine, and it was spotless. Sleep quality in the rooms at the 'back' (overlooking the parking lot and golf course) is excellent. The shuttle service, on time and exact, is outstanding (6mn., 10 in rush hour traffic). The staff also deserve great praise, from the desk clerks to the shuttle drivers: friendly, efficient and helpful, they know that at airports promptness is paramount. The attached restaurant (MIckele's, note the k, probably to ensure the Italian pronunciation) is very good (see separate review), and serves as the locale for the complimentary so-so breakfast (no hot items in the buffet). Our bill for one night, dinner for two with wine was under $190 all included (taxes and tip), which has to be excellent value. And they cheerfully kept a bag of our winter stuff, no charge, for the two weeks (and retrieved it immediately on request).

We usually stay downtown to be close to the appointments, but it gets expensive when downtown hotels are generally $150+ per night plus 30 or 40 for parking. So since the appointments allowed time for driving, we decided to stay further away from downtown. I am usually the one to book our hotel rooms and stick with brands like Westin, Sheraton, Hilton, etc. One of the most important things to me in a hotel is a comfortable bed, and those hotels generally deliver. But when I read that Best Western Plus has similarly comfortable beds I thought we'd give it a try. We had booked a regular room with king bed, but when we arrived we found out we'd been upgraded. When we got to our room it looked like the honeymoon suite! Large room with a heart-shaped jacuzzi tub (too bad we didn't have time to use it). And the bed was divine, I slept like a baby. The only reason it gets 4 out of 5 is the continental breakfast in the morning (which is another reason we booked this hotel) wasn't the greatest. Nothing healthy on the menu at all.... all the cereals are high in sugar, muffins, fruit, make-your-own waffles (which was tricky), bread for toast (which my husband found mold on).

There is free parking and free airport shuttle. Long term parking is availale for about $5.00 per day. A free hearty continental breakfast is offered. It featured juices, fresh fruit, tea and coffee, hard boiled eggs, a variety of breads and bagels, a large choice of breakfast pastries and muffins, as well as a \"do-it-yourself\" fresh waffle station. Free morning local newspapers are available. The street on which the hotel is situated, is in a business (not industrial) park. There is car traffic in the morning and late afternoon. There is no truck traffic. There is a large choice of restaurants within two blocks, as well as a convenience store. The rest of the time, quieteness rules. The hotel does NOT lie under airport approaches, so plane noise is not a concern. Our room, in the rear, faced a golf course, so the only disturbance was the very occasional 'thwack' of a golf ball. Another plus was , even though the hotel was near the airport, getting to central and northern Toronto was not a problem, as Eglinton Avenue goes all the way across the city. The slight extra travel time was a good trade-off for the reasonable room rates. Would we recommend this property ?

It was forty minutes standing in the freezing cold before a Middle Eastern woman picked us up. No apology was offered and on the ride to the hotel she turned the heat right down.

Forty minutes came and went and finally I went into the airport to warm up and I called the hotel and asked where the shuttle was. They told me it would be five or ten minutes. When the driver FINALLY arrived after one hour of waiting, he told my husband he had been there a half hour before, which was an out and out lie as we had been standing there. So after an hour (and by this time it was past 11:30 pm) a young middle eastern man finally arrives and puts our bags into the car. He, just as the previous driver, turns DOWN the heat. We are tired and cold and told him to turn it back up. And with him we had to tell him twice to turn the fan up. We had to be up at 5 in the morning b/c they could NOT get us to the airport when we needed to be. They only have one small van and were booked for the later sessions. Four hours sleep, standing in the freezing cold, no coffee or breakfast at that time of the morning, I would DEFINITELY NEVER stay here again.

One of the few \"Airport Hotels' that allow you to leave your vehicle on premises more than 7 days without an extra charge. This moderate 3 story hotel is located on the south side of the 401, about 15 minutes from the airport terminals. They run a free airport shuttle from 5:00AM to Midnight. The shuttle operates on the hour and must be booked prior to using it. When you arrive at the airport a quick call to the hotel desk and the shuttle comes directly to pick you up. One of the benefits is that few people staying here are on a \"park n' fly\" program so the shuttle is not busy plus the hotel has it's own van which is a bonus as others in the area share a van/bus which are croweded and takes forever to drop off or pick up. The hotel is situated on Eglington Ave in a primarily commercial office district with few retail outlets such as restaurants and convenience stores close by. The onsite restaurant was being renovated during our stay so the hotel made arrangements with the donut shop next door to provide a complimentary breakfast free of charge with your stay. The staff are excellent, very helpfull and give the feeling that they are there to make sure your stay is trouble free. The hotel is a newer building and rooms are pretty well standard with a small fridge and microwave. The bathrooms are spacious and very bright. The airconditioner/heater is a window-floor unit and can be loud at times. This hotel also offers suites with a heart shaped Jacuzzi and huge sitting area, one of the larger hotel rooms we have stayed in. The beds are the standard Best Western with pleny of pillows and one thing we did notice is that the rooms we stayed in were pretty sound proof even being next the the elevator.

If you're catching an early flight, your AM driver will be Paul, who's from Ireland and can weave a good spell during the 5 minute drive to the airport!", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cHandy Airport Stopover\u201d", "Author": "Doug&Sharon", "ReviewID": "UR10012812", "Content": "July 7 2007 we just needed to overnight near Toronto airport and this worked out well.

Right next to it! Lobby was very nice and had elevator! Went to our room on 3rd floor and when entering room, we were amazed! It was fairly big and roomy. Considerably big bathroom, then a fully mirrored folding door to closet with iron and ironing board. Then it's the roomy bed, coffee table with a couch, desk & mirror with desk lamp, a standing lamp, and 2 lamps next to the bed! TV in a big wooden thingy with drawers. Called front desk for extra pillow and was told to look in drawer under TV & found it (very convenient!). The AC works great since it's so hot in the summer (although the lobby and hallways..and the room when we entered...were kinda hot, after turning on the AC, we're all set. Oh! And free high-speed wireless internet access! Just bring in laptop with wireless thingy! Just arrived a few hours ago and loved this place so much just wanted to share this NOW!

Used my airmiles for the hotel, but think the $89 a night is a fairly good rate. Front desk had our keys waiting for us upon arrival. Used the shuttle service to and from the airport, efficient and safe. Shuttle runs at quarter past the hour, which didn't meet our schedule. They changed the schedule for us so we wouldn't have to take a cab, much appreciated. The rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable. Ate at the newly re-opened restaurant Mawal, and it was fantastic. The owner Ramos is a very nice man who has had health issues and is now back running his restaurant. We ordered the smoked salmon and the order was so big, we couldn't finish it. Great value for $11. The greek salad was very good also.

I booked this hotel because it offered a free airport shuttle and a complimentary breakfast for a good price for the area. I found all that was promised and received good value. Once I called the hotel from the airport, the shuttle came within 20 minutes. Check in was smooth and I was pleased with the room and amenities. There is a good sized mini fridge, a microwave oven and a large TV with free movies. My problem with my stay was encountered when I requested information for catching a bus to the subway station. I was told when I booked this hotel that I could get a bus conveniently and easily to the subway. I know a bit about the Toronto transit system and felt comfortable with this, but feel that not only was the information that I was provided false, it was not substantial enough to be of assistance to somebody who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my level of experience in this city. When I was ready to leave, I stopped by the front desk to ask where I catch the bus and was told to walk \u00e2\u20ac\u01534 blocks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd down the street to the bus stop. The distance to the bus stop may have been equivalent to 4 blocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 distance, but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a measured 4 blocks which is very confusing. The bigger problem is that once I got to the bus stop I found it marked as running during peak periods only and this was at 2 p.m. I referred to some information that I had and aimed toward a totally different street for the bus, passing another hotel en route. When there I thought I would confirm my information with them and was told that you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a bus at that time of the day and that guests at their hotel who were looking to get to the subway took a cab there. I could have saved an abundance of time and inconvenience if the Travel Inn had told me this information from the beginning. The next problem was that I had asked the desk clerk at the Travel Inn how much the bus cost and was advised that it is $2.25 so I pulled out that amount of cash to have it ready. It was a small thing, but I was angered to find that the price is actually $2.50. I might expect these 2 pieces of misinformation from a stranger on the street who is not in the business of guest services or dealing with people who are from out of the city or province. I think that there is no excuse for these mistakes from somebody advising a foreigner and in a position where one would be led to believe that advice! The continental breakfast offered a variety of items and my transfer back to the airport was efficient. I would recommend this hotel as a stopover hotel at the airport, but caution travelers that the cab to the subway will cost $20 and that the information gleaned from the front desk staff, though pleasantly delivered may be erroneous.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cGreat room !\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR907482", "Content": "Great room at a great price.
