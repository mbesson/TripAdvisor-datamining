I stayed there last summer with my boyfriend. At first we were very angry with the receptionist cause they couldn't find our reservation. The stuff was not very friendly at this time. After a few hours an some phones, we found out that the travel agent had booked our room with the help of the manager and assistant manager did'n know that. The hotel was full and they gave us a really small room with no window. The window that it was there, had a view at the emergency ladder. Ok, the decoration is so kitch. The hotel is big and like a labyrinth but not so difficult. The elevator is small. When we were there too many big families were there, too many children yelling and screaming and calling from their room telephone to ours in the middle of the night. That was horrible but it was not hotel's fault. The guy in the reception I think was from Lebanon. Really cute! :) but a bit snob. Not very helfull stuff but not bad either. The breakfast was great! Too many option as most hotels in Istanbul. I loved the honeycomb! It was delicious! Every morning they had a big wooden base with koneycomp and you can cut as much as you want. It was clean hotel, with spacious bathroom. Not too big but really good. Bath products were there every day. (soap is very nice perfumed!) It might not be a 4 star, but not only 3 either. I mean there are some defaults but I would surely recomend it. It is a taksim square hotel, clean, quiet with really good breakfast and very reasonable price. I always prefer to stay at the taksim side of Istanbul and not at Sultan Ahmet, so this is ideal location. It also has a roof restaurant (Lebaneze as far as I can remember) but it is not budget. Nicw view of the night city and really nice food. But a bit expensive for my pocket. I would definitely stay there again, I just hope I'll be in an other room :)", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cExcellent in everything\u201d", "Author": "Ahmed A", "ReviewID": "UR126386695", "Content": "I did travel last 4th of march to spend my honeymoon there in Istanbul for 7 nights 8 days , really I did enjoy every moment I spent there in Istanbul , specially my stay in the Hotel , it was amazing experience to stay there , at the first we were reading about how small is the hotel , and the lobby etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6., but nothing to be judged without seeing it with your own eyes , we went there we found that how big are their rooms , we stayed in room 322 big room on the 3rd floor and it was Excellent .

Whether it be the garish furniture in the lobby or the circus funhouse-style hallways that slant strangely, this place is in the 400s for suitability for a very good reason. I ended up at Cartoon because of a conference, so had not vote in the matter. I had upgraded to a suite when on seeing the regular rooms I knew I was in for trouble. Although it was billed as non-smoking, the room reeked of smoke for the entire five days regardless of the air conditioning I kept on. Matter of fact, it was probably the vents that were pumping in the smoke! It's always disturbing staying in a room with dirty carpets and stained walls--particularly the bathroom walls! I found each morning the shower ran relentlessly onto the floor and had the maid not left her cart outside the door every night, I would have had no way to gather enough towels to stop the flood. Even in reporting this to the staff, their efforts could not remedy what must have been a leaky door or some such thing. The toiletries were cheap and useless, but I had brought my own from a lovely Sofitel property where I had stayed the week before, so I was fine. One morning, I had to work on a project, only to be overtaken with noxious fumes coming under the door from the hallway. In peering out, I noted the maintenance crew repainting the walls with an obviously-toxic paint whose fumes have got to cause cancer. I begged them to stop, but by then the smell had infested my room. Remarkably, once the paint dried, the hallways looked no better for the work. Breakfast: About a C-. I have yet to find bad bread in Turkey, where a friend of mine says emphatically that Turks love their pastry. So, cheese, a few nice olives, and a roll were about all that were suitable. The apples, although fresh all over Turkey and the planet now, were mealy and tasteless. The tea, which is a mainstay of any Turkish meal--or between, for that matter--was dispensed from a machine that also made lattes. This meant the tea invariably had milk residue in it. While I often like my tea with milk, I prefer to add it, not get some weird slime in it. Cartoon, fix the tea issue! I will say this about the bed. It was clean and it was comfortable. After all the horror stories I hear about bedbugs, I am vigilant, but none so far as I could see. The only problem was the curio cabinet in the corner with plastic Winnie the Poo inside. Its internal light would NOT go off and so I had to black out the light with a dark shirt. I told you. Weird. All in all, I would never stay here again under any circumstance.

We absolutely loved the hotel and being 2 single girls, we felt pretty safe! The rooms were quiet, clean, hairdryer available, cupboard and a safe, mini fridge/bar, tv, the beds were SO comfortable and made you wanna come back after a long tiring day of sight seeing, the bathroom was clean with hot water available at all times, the staff was VERY friendly and helpful. we were confused about locations to some banks we needed to exchange money from and travel agencies and they helped us and even drew a lil map for us so we knew where we were going. On one day, my friend's phone battery died and she didn't have a Nokia charger, and the staff at once agreed to keep the mobile at the front desk fr charging for 30 mins till we could come pick it up...at NO extra cost! They even allowed us to use the computer at the front desk to book our tickets online to ephesus coz our comp wouldn't work....n that too at NO extra cost! The breakfast was something we would look forward to every morning...amazing choice of food...olives, cream, honey, fruits, different kinds of fresh bread, cookies, diff kinds of cheese, turkey bacon slices, sausages, scrambled eggs, baked tomatoes with cheese, black coffee, white coffee, orange juice....and so many other kinds of food I don't know the names of :-) On 3 mornings , we were asked to come to \"the moon\" restaurant which is a restaurant on the 9th floor of the hotel...where breakfast was served and it was AMAZING! It has glass walls n a glass roof....n you can get the view of the city , soft music, great food....just perfect! On our third day, we had booked an early morning flight to Ephesus...and asked the night before if they could give us a wake up call at 4:30 am the next morning! Sure enough, the next morning, sharp at 4:30 we get a wakeup call...and another one 10 mins after just to make sure we were up for our flight! When we went down to the lobby, it was still dark outside and the staff refused to let us out alone to get a taxi and immediately arranged for a taxi which arrived in 5 mins. I must say that if i go to Istanbul again, I'm gonna stay at the Cartoon Hotel only! Great value for money, great location(walking distance from taksim square and the tramvay and amazing restaurants and shops, or any public transit) n great staff! We even gave them some sweets and a thank you note before we left! We were so pleased to have found such a great hotel!", "Date": "April 12, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cartoon Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d304806-Reviews-Cartoon_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$130 - $261*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Tarlabasi Bulvari No.36-38</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Taksim</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">80080</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "304806", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9b/74/9b7476337086b90ec7059483a51457721large.jpg"}}
