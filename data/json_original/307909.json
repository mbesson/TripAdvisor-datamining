I booked upfront at the desk and the booking manager matched the online price which was good. Was initially upset with the allotted room as it looked completely different from what was shown on the web page so after spending one night in a smaller room I complained to Marketing staff and they were really really very good. They were very very friendly and happily agreed to change my room and moved me into a bigger and comfortable room. Cheers to that!! I would recommend to check the room before you actually check-in because some rooms really are small. The morning breakfast was included in the room price and it was very good. New menu everyday and especially the Indian menus were great too. Bath fittings and other small things could have been better but I think its okay for that price. Overall a good Hotel...

I stayed in a 3-person room #334. The hotel has a free wi-fi but it doesn't always work and it works only in a few first-floor rooms and some places of lobby. There is a business center with a few computers and internet. Admiral Plaza Hotel (nowdays Coral Admiral Plaza Hotel, by the way) is not very well known among the taxi drivers even though it's been there over a decade. Sometimes we told the driver to take us to \"Royal Ascot Hotel\" which is a nearby 5-star well known hotel. Metro station is about 10-15 min walk away through a straight route. The station is green line and next one has a connection to red line. Our shower had seperate hot and cold water taps which I've always hated because they're not as easy to adjust as just one tap with both. Our room (334) had a crazy A/C that either was too hard to operate or broken. It was always either hot and moist or just plain cold. Some other rooms had newer digital A/C:s which worked just fine. Our room had a large construction yard in the next block. They were building 24/7 and the noice was there day and night and it came inside the room. The beds were nice and I saw no bugs at all during our 10-day stay. Room service didn't work very well. We once ordered a breakfast for the next morning. After about five calls from us to room service and vice versa, the custom breakfast for our friend with a birthday, was not ready on time and we had to cancel it next morning. I asked for the cheapest way to make local phone calls. The receptionist told me to use the phone found in my room. Two minutes of local calls made a bill of 19 EUR or 25 USD. After complaining I got it for free and was told that the phone in reception is actually FREE to use. This, the confusion with room service and other small things made me not to trust the staff very much, even though they were friendly. One strange thing noted here often is that the reception actually takes away your passports. I did not like that, but gave it away and got it back without problems. For some it was a problem as we needed some ID later on and all did not have extra-ID's with them. Most other quests were indian and the hotel was located on a non-luxorious area but it did not matter at all.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Espoo, Finland", "Title": "\u201cNot as shown on webpage!\u201d", "Author": "VisaElectron", "ReviewID": "UR122364211", "Content": "Some have said the location is great - not so sure about that.

This time, we decided to book at the last minute, during the four-day weekend of Eid Al Adha. The cheapest rate available on Hotels.com was 435 Euros (2,200 dirhams) for two nights at the Admiral Plaza Hotel - a three-star property near the Creek in Bur Dubai. None of the other places where we often stay were available and the hotel description sounded adequate, although you usually pay less than this for a five-star hotel in Dubai these days.. We booked the hotel and drove to Dubai the next day. Everything went wrong from the moment we arrived. The unloading area at the hotel can only accommodate three cars, and a line-up was backed way out into a busy street in this VERY busy neighborhood. After about 25 minutes, we were able to pull up to the front and unload our bags. We pulled as far ahead as we could and went inside to register. There were three people working at the reception desk; the one who assisted us told us that they had no reservation for us. We found our Hotels.com voucher, showed it to them, and were told to wait in the reception area. Twenty minutes later, we were told we had to move our car because it was blocking a tour bus. The hotel has NO parking area whatsoever, so my partner was directed to a paid lot some 5 to 10 minutes away from the hotel (walking distance) to park our car. (The lot is about 50 dirhams a day.) We waited a further 25 minutes after he returned, or about 45 minutes in all, before we were asked to come to the counter to register. Our reservation was for a double room with a Queen bed, but our very small room had two twin beds. I promptly went back to reception to request a room with a double bed, but was told that there were none available. We had arrived at the hotel just after the check-in time of 2:00 pm, so I was very surprised at this, but we were stuck with the room we had. The room was clean and comfortable, as other reviewers have noted, but here are several significant items - listed in the description of rooms on the hotel website - that are NOT in the room: daily complimentary water, bathroom phone, sofa, trouser press, complimentary newspaper. In addition, the website says the hotel has a \"lounge\" on site. We took this to mean a place serving alcohol - what else does a \"lounge\" mean? But the hotel lost their liquor license several years ago and there is NO alcohol in the hotel at all. The \"lounge\" is several black faux leather sofas on the mezzanine floor where you can sit and chat. Other grossly misleading informatgion on the website says that the hotel is 1.2 km from the gold souq. The gold souq is on the other side of the creek in Deira and is a good 10 to 15 minute cab ride! Not even 1.2 km \"as the crow flies\". Also, the hotel apparently realizes that their airport shuttle service has had problems (e.g., noted by travelers in other reviews) and a notice in the rooms now says that the service must be ordered 7 hours in advance and the time to the airport cannot be predicted. But the very worst part about this hotel is the attitude of the staff on the reception desk. We returned from walking the creek area and surrounding souqs all day long, at the end of our first full day in Dubai, and found no replacement bottles of \"compliementary\" water. in our room We called the front desk and were told that water is provided only at check-in. I disagreed and read from our hotel voucher that we would receive daily complimentary water and newspaper (the newspaper never showed up either). The woman argued with me and said that no, they don't provide complimentary water, just what is in the room when you arrive. She said we would have to order more water from room service and pay for it. My partner took the hotel voucher and went down to have a \"full and frank\" discussion with her. Unbelievably - she still argued with him that we could have no more free water. So he asked for the manager. The manager was very helpful and acknowledged that we should have had free water (2 small bottles) every day and also a newspaper. He sent a plate of fruit to the room as an apology, along with 2 large bottles of water. As outrageous as it was to pay more for this three-star hotel than we have usually paid for high-end accommodations in Dubai and elsewhere, I didn't mind because it was a last-minute reservation during a holiday weekend. But the staff at the reception desk were just horrible - rude, brusque and completely unhelpful. We have stayed in Dubai hotels that are much more modest than this - the Ambassador, for example, which is ancient in Dubai terms - but never have we been treated this poorly.

However, we got to the hotel in good time without any fuss. Upon arrival, the hotel lobby looked clean and professional, gold trim setting off polished marble, seasoned with Christmas tree and fake presents (wrapped in \"happy birthday\" paper), behind which was a lounging area in front of the restaurant area. Seating regions were cooled and comfortable with complimentary drinks (urns of hot water and other drinks left over from breakfast), making it a relaxing and pleasant environment to wait in. The mezzanine floor above contained the business centre and access to the gym, swimming pool and sauna, as well as a railway-themed Indian restaurant to the side. Prices for eating there - and room service in general - were markedly higher than you'd find on the street, so we elected to eat out instead of trying hotel food (apart from breakfast). The breakfast service was variable; although it was self-service, waitresses would occasionally rush up to offer tea/coffee for us, neglecting to spot that the table hadn't been relaid following previous diners - on a few occasions I had to prompt waiting staff (standing around, staring vacantly) for bread refills or more/clean cutlery. Nevertheless, there was plenty of food to suit a wide range of palates as well as fresh fruit and hot/cold drinks, and complimentary papers, meaning a fairly good start to the day. My only advice is to get there earlier before the hot food has had a chance to dry out, so you're not kept waiting for diner-initiated replenishments. Service offered by the Business Centre up on the Mezzanine floor was quite poor. I tried to book a safari tour through the desk attendant; he rang it through and - finding no answer - told us to try back later. He showed no sign of taking our details and trying on our behalf, so we ended up walking into town and booking it ourselves through another travel agency, who demonstrated much greater efficiency. In the business centre I had difficulties printing from any of the three public machines (they had several unidentifiable printers listed, but only two visible in the room - and one of those wasn't actually network-enabled) - I had to cut n' paste an image into a word document on the attendant's work machine to print out a map. Occasionally the machines would flick over to another wireless network, necessitating the attendant to correct the network connections, but from the third day onwards internet speeds were very slow - whether this was a problem with the hotel or their ISP (or routing in general) I couldn't tell, but the staff didn't seem that interested, merely shrugging it off with \"the site is being slow\". It seemed apparent to me - from the mouse actions of the different attendants - that they'd not been trained (or were too experienced) in many of the systems they were expected to support. The overall tone was that it wasn't suitable for business needs; there was too much maintenance and manual intervention required that suggested thoughtlessness and inefficient set-up. The bedroom itself was large and clean, with TV, safe, fridge, drinks-making facilities and on-suite bathroom. The overall d\u00e9cor looked as though someone had raided a retirement home for furniture and fittings; two lights had been wired into one plug and the thermostat on the wall was an ageing circular design, lacking a cover, but soon figured out what combination of switches and dials worked the lights, air-con and bathroom fan. The adjoining bathroom was somewhat shabby with broken tiles, badly-repaired grout and splatter mould in shelf corners plus a very stiff tap to get shower to work - however it wasn't grotty enough to prevent use. Nonetheless, clean towels were always provided, and it served its purpose. We couldn't use the safe - it was already locked and we'd been given no combination. The fridge didn't chill properly (a large ice block at the back showed that it hadn't been maintained recently) but contained complimentary bottles of water, which only appeared on the first day - I wasn't sure if these were intended to be replenished daily, like the tea/coffee provided (although these stocks were permitted to run low and we had to keep requesting more supplies). The TV was hooked up to satellite but had no operating instructions; I flicked it over to AV to see the satellite programmes but since they were all tuned to Arabic channels we stuck to terrestrial TV which showed BBC. Despite all this - and some construction work taking place out the back of the hotel near our room - I slept quite soundly in beds with sheets and blankets, oddly. The swimming pool was open - small and somewhat dimly-lit, but suitable for a family to take a paddle and swim a few 10m lengths. The sauna looked like a cleaner's cupboard in the pool's changing rooms - just a wooden walled-off corner. However, this was out of operation, as was the gym (since sept, according to previous reports mentioned here) and nobody in the hotel seemed to know when they would be available. The lack of attention to detail extended to the front desk where I received terrible customer service; the travel agency had rang and left a message for us concerning another trip but this message was never communicated along (we checked daily, fearing that the desk wouldn't be proactive in volunteering this information, but they weren't even particularly good at recording information). We wanted to book an airport taxi for the morning flight and was told it was free, but only discovered much later (when enquiring about pick-up times) that the hotel's complimentary taxi runs every hour - which meant a long wait at the airport, so instead had the front desk organise a paid taxi booked for the correct time. When returning to the hotel that evening we checked the taxi booking but the woman on duty could find no record of it, although she still confirmed it was booked okay (not sure how she arrived at that conclusion). The next morning no taxi arrived, the front desk denied any knowledge that one was ever booked nor requested (because no record existed) and in desperation the bellhop nipped out down the street and flagged one down for us. Out of all the staff there, the bellhops seemed the most customer-focussed and efficient; it is a pity they are required to perform above and beyond their normal call of duty due to incompetent reception staff.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lagos Nigeria", "Title": "\u201cExceeded my expectations\u201d", "Author": "ArynAjalaTravel", "ReviewID": "UR90981223", "Content": "My stay at Admiral Plaza was extremely pleasant.

I had a clean room, the bed was mazzive. the bathroom had several towels, including toilteries! The ambience was more than i expected since a lot of reveiws i read had been negative. I was so pleantly surpirsed. It was truly a 3 star hotel . The staff were nice, they worked shifts and spoke several languages and were rather helpful about pointing out locations and nearby attractions. The hotel is well located. Close enough to attractons and close to the Meena Bazaar where i got a lot of deals. I went to dubai witha a bias about the hotel, but it was turned around.

The rooms are quite small, and yes, as the previous reviewer mentioned, you can get a hotel apartment much bigger, but it is further away and with not many shops around. I suppose it depends on whether you want to walk to attractions or if you will be catching taxis mostly. Travelling alone is expensive here, as I met another group of women who shared rooms and cut costs significantly. For an extra AUD40 a night I could have stayed in a pleasant 4 star hotel, and will do this on the next stopover. Location: The hotel is about 10-15 minutes walk to the creek, where the Dubai Souk and Abra stations are. These small boats cost AED1 to cross the creek to Deira (gold and spice souks). Little electronic stores and several food shops surround the alleyways and street of the hotel. There are always people walking around and it is quite busy. Catching a taxi is easy from the main st, 5 mins walk in either direction (Al Fahidi St, or Kalid Bin Al Waleed Rd. The Computer Plaza (Al Ain Plaza), Spinneys supermarket, and Jumbo Electronics are on Mankhool Rd close to the Metro. This is also convenient. Beware, the streets can be disorientating, and I recommend printing out google maps of the area. This area can be rather intimidating for women travelling alone, as men have no shame and will hit on you (married or not) in taxis, when asking for directions, in shops, and you get stares when walking down the street. It is best to wear your poker face and do not act friendly to anyone (if you are a female independent traveller). I caught a taxi from the MOE to hotel, and the driver was trying to chat me up. Disgusting. Service: I stayed 3 nights in total, and the service was not consistent. Staff at front desk varied, and I had a bad experience trying to book a City walking tour, as they didn't understand what I was saying. Another time, the lady was very helpful and informed me of the free wifi on M level. And also beware of directions given, when they say it is close, it's best to check the map first! The bed was firm, and there were no loud parties going on at night, so sleep was good. You can, however, hear when people nearby are going in/out of their rooms, as the doors slam shut. The bathroom is small and average, but my shower curtain had an awful damp smell and the tile grouting needed a good mould clean in some areas. For a short stay, I let this slide. But I will not be booking my stopover through Emirates again, I am very disappointed they recommended I stay here as a solo female traveller. Food: I didn't eat here, so cannot comment.

If for e.g. I need to judge a 3 Star Hotel for Rooms, I should not compare the Room size, facilities, comfort etc. keeping in mind what I had experienced in a 5 Star Hotel, that would be incorrect & unjustified. I would rate it 5 points even if the Room is small but clean & cozy, because that's what I have paid for. The reason I am saying all the above is to justify that this Hotel is a \"5 Star\" amongst 3 Stars !! Neat & clean Room & Toilet, decent breakfast & great location. Offers Airport pick & drop, which is good a bonus that would otherwise set you back by an additional 100-120 Dirhams. The Hotel has an excellent location in Bur Dubai area with plenty of shops & restaurants around including Internet Cafes. The Indian Restaurant inside the Hotel themed on a Railway Coach offers good Indian Food & seemed quite popular, for even outside Guests were patronizing it. The Room was small but quite comfortable & never felt inadequate. With the Tea/Coffee maker, Refrigerator & Safety Locker inside the Room it never felt wanting anything more. Don't expect too much from the Pool, Business Centre etc. Ideally this Hotel is for Tourists only, with it's location & facilities that suit a particular type of Traveler only. Avoid this Hotel if going for Business or Recreation. The Front Desk Staff were the only people I mostly interacted with & they were quite pleasant & helpful.

I enjoy exploring new areas on foot and found the Admiral Plaza a great location. The abras are nearby for those wishing to cross the creek and visit the Gold and Spice Souks. I would highly recommend the nearby Heritage House and adjacent school.

Its not a 7 star hotel, or even a 5 star hotel, but by US standards (not developing world standards) it is certainly at least a 3 star hotel", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "india", "Title": "\u201cbetter than an average hotel\u201d", "Author": "amrinder1m", "ReviewID": "UR15216531", "Content": "this hotel is smaller than the other hotels i have stayed in but it was clean and the staff was accomodating.breakfast was real good having variety. we were 3 doctors and stayed there for 4 days for a conference in dubai.we were given a triplet room. it was spacious .bathroom was with bathtub.clean environment. overall good stay and it was cheap too.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bahrain", "Title": "\u201cnot worth the money\u201d", "Author": "sarah272", "ReviewID": "UR15068119", "Content": "When we arrived we were told we're lucky to have such a nice room and all...what they described to be ''nice'' turned out to be VERY small for 2 people, but that's not the worst - the bathroom is small, smelly and has green and blue stains on it's walls which makes it a real pleasure to take showers. *yuck* And then there is the bed... the sheets were not changed for 3 days and the blankets were itchy and too thin for the air condition, speaking of which: the air condition is damn noisy, goes on and off all night, the cold air hits your face directly. So we woke up with a blocked nose. Don't get me started on the pool - we didn't even bother swimming in it. So you're sitting in this hotel - spending your time outside or watching movies on a miniature TV and ordering from their restaurant which I don't recommend.

Staying at this hotel ruined our holiday to Dubai. We booked to stay for a week having been tempted by the hotel website showing pool facilities, jacuzzi and a bar. Upon arrival we were shown to our room which for two people was VERY small. There was no room to relax apart from one small chair. The fridge did not work and the view out over the back of flats was grotty. After two requests someone did come and change the fuse and the fridge did eventaully work. However, the hotel described 'mini bar facilities' (there were none). When we enquired about the pool we were shown down a dark corridor to a locked door. The pool looked about half full and we were told someone would have to come and unlock the door if we wanted to use it. The final straw was that when we asked where the bar was so we could chill out over a glass of wine, we were told it had shut down (it's still advertised within the hotel). Remember the only place you can buy alcolhol in Dubai is in hotels! The only good thing we can say is that the hotel was clean and our rooms were tidied daily.

The hotel bathrooms do leave alot to be desired. Some of the hotel staff were very nice, some I felt looked down a little on me travelling without a male I feel. The hotel website is also misleading it states that their is a bar, they do not sell and alcholic beverages at all, the hotel was empty every evening, for me personally I do not feel the need to go out every evening, it would have been nice after a busy day just to chill in the hotel with a glass of wine. The hotel also states that there are free beach transfers, this also was not provided. Be warned the noise from the traffic is quite bad. The upside of this hotel were the people I met there, being outgoing I will introduce myself. Things to do, the Dune safari was good fun (When they eventually picked us up, they are always late), the trip was around \u00a330, for us this trip was great as I was met up with my sister, her husband, Ceilia & Mark from South Africa that we met in the hotel who were really lovely genuine peope. I also ate in several nice places, my favorite being Spice Island (renaisance hotel) in Deira, its a 5* hotel with food & drink to match, all you can eat & drink for around \u00a327, food galore & excellent quality. We went on the dow cruise which was also very nice. We did several Malls, the biggest being the Emerites Mall, I personally didnt buy much as the prices were the same as in the UK, they have a ski centre there which my son loved. Be warned though do not leave at 5pm like I did as the traffic is terrible, try to avoid travelling between 5 and 8pm.

Although I have previously stayed in amazing hotels, in my opinion, a hotel is just a hotel, it's a place to sleep, spending the whole day or night in the hotel is something that can be done in your country of residence at a cheaper cost. We were given the Quad, it was very grey and ugly looking, we were not impressed, but we put up with it. It all started when the music started, the bass was thumping that we couldnt sleep. When we complained, we were advised that this was the nightclub and it stops at around midnight. In fairness to the person we spoke to, it did stop around midnight. The next day however, we made a complaint and asked to change rooms. We were moved that day and this room was MUCH better. Not only was it not grey, it had space and looked cleaner. At night we could not hear the music, so we were fine. Like I said, I've been to worse, if you are planning on going out and around Dubai, like we did, it's fine as a place to sleep. We found the staff to be very friendly, the porter that moved our bags into the new room, was very helpful. The biggest letdown in this hotel, was the prostitutes.

Upon seeing this, we asked the fellow who had helped with our bags if all the rooms were like this - he said yes. After that, I went to the front desk, and they moved us across the hall to a room that was, surprise, twice the size. Okay - so night came and we figured, lets go eat. There were three restaurants in the place, and we entered the first. Was a bunch of single guys sipping drinks around a raised stage with several girls dancing to overly loud music. No problem, two others to pick from, right? Well guess what, both of the other two were the same. This was prostitute central! Ended up walking to some corner stores and buying fruit and the like. So, the second night and there is major loud music vibrating the room. Turns out , in additon to the three 'restaurants' that were on the other side of the building (poors folks staying on top of them), there was another party room, that was under our room. There was no where to go but up, so we went to the front and they changed us right away (they were very slick about it - I wasn't the first to complain). Anyway, we were now on the top floor, but the vibrations just carried. Then, when nothing else could go wrong, the AC stopped working.

Room - The room is standard 3 star. It is a decent size (around 300 square feet or 29 square meters), but it is generally worn and showing signs of age. The bathroom is large with a bath and shower, but the water pressure was soooooo bad. I could not gen enough pressure to get the shampoo out of my hair. The bar in the lobby is FULL of prostitutes. It was very unpleasant. Also, our room was directly above the bar so all night we could here the \"bang bang bang\" of the music - it stopped around 4am. And then at 8am the construction would start above our room, so there was constant drilling. Not impressed. Service - The staff are not very friendy and nor do they need to be. This hotel is part of the Emirates stopover deal, and therefore they get guests regardless of how good/bad the hotel is. The staff just don't really care about the guests. They give you your room key and that's about it. Food - The buffet breakfast is very ordinary. I could cook a better breakfast myself and I am a bad cook. Lobby - The lobby area is small but well decorated. Location - The area around the hotel is full of character - very Arabic. There are plenty of small shops and restaurants.
