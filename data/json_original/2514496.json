Our bed a super king was very comfortable with its new mattress. In fact they had taken delivery while there of dozens of new mattresses. We had a view of the garden on the first floor which was fairly quiet, and you could open the window a plus for us The lounge/bar area was fine but the exclusive Club lounge was a small, narrow, windowless basement room that no one would want to spend any time in. Breakfast was fine a good buffet choice of either a cooked breakfast, pastries, cerels, yogurt, juice and fruit. Shame again also located in the windowless basement. Could not name lots of members of staff as some reviewers, as we were out and about most of the time, but they seemed friendly We paid just under \u00a3200 for two nights in a Club Room with breakfast and for this we got a pleasant stay, if i had paid alot more i would have been disappointed, in my opinon a three not four star hotel.

My wife and I stayed for one night on 4th February and booked the hotel through 'Laterooms' about 3 weeks in advance. For the grade of hotel it was about the cheapest and just where we needed to be. The weather was cold -it was the first day of the snow in London. Our check-in was very quick and efficient with staff being very helpful, one carried our suitcase across to the room which we had been upgraded to (a 3rd or 4th floor apartment with a small kitchen facility). The room was very clean and modern, and extremely comfortable. The lift was very good and quite as it was adjacent to our room. Despite overlooking the road between this building and the main hotel it was very, very quite. Being across from the hotel wasn't a problem as we were not using the hotel's facilities. We did have a problem trying to understand the air-conditioning controls but it turned out that we were trying to use the bathroom control which was in the bedroom whilst the main room control was in the lobby so my fault. However on mentioning this to the staff they were with us in less than 2 minutes to sort out the 'problem' and also brought a heater with them just in case there was a real problem. Staff very polite. Room was wonderfully warm I didn't use the hotel's facilities as I didn't have the time but everything was clean and tidy that I saw.

There was a smell of fresh paint which meant that they were obviously redecorating. Check in was quick and efficient and I was advised that my room was in the building opposite and downstairs! Expecting the worst and thinking I was going to be in a dark room with possibly no windows I was escorted across. On entering the room I thought they had allocated me the wrong one as it was a good size (I could walk around the bed easily), it was very clean and modern and it even had a window. Not only that... It also had a huge shower with a standard head and a rainfall head! There was also a small kitchenette with sink, microwave and fridge, which had I been staying a few days would have come in real handy I'm sure. The bed was comfy and the lighting good. The TV channel selection was also good. I almost wish I had more time to spend in the room! Breakfast was served back in the main building which wasn't a problem. The choice was great as was the service and the room setting. Checking out was as easy as checking in, with no hassle. I left my bag with the porter for the day and when I asked I was given the code for the free wifi! Having been so surprised at the whole experience I even completed a survey and handed it in on departure. Credit where it's due I feel.

In fact we wanted to use our BW points for our last two nights in the UK and London always being expensive we thought that this was the place to use up 64,000 points! Also the hotel is within walking distance of Paddington station and the Heathrow Express. We had read other comments on TA but thought, well, most hotel rooms are small in London, so we gave it a try!! Wrong! The room is every bit as pokey as others have mentioned, with the bed being stuck at the end of the narrow room, taking up most of the wall space. In fairness, the room was quite comfortably decorated and furnished but it looked as though very little thought had gone into the design of such a very tiny room. First there was the appalling lighting, then there was the badly designed bathroom... oh sure it had a trendy looking sink, but no space, and again poor lighting and mirrors. The towel rack was very, very high on the wall (probably because the room was so small that there was nowhere else that it would have fitted) then there was the shower stall which was really small and a toilet seat that didn't fit. We have in the past stayed at the Corus in Lancaster Gate ( very close by) and their rooms are also very small but they have amazing design features that allow you to be able to use the bathroom and room well - good lighting and mirrors, so it's not impossible to make small rooms that are functional. Then there is the front desk. They all seem to be vague about the hotel, we were not told where the breakfast room was or the bar, and neither are easy to find. The television stopped working, we called down to report it and were told that someone would be there immediately - no one ever came. Breakfast was good, though not included, it was however a buffet style full English breakfast. Even in there some of the staff, quite frankly seemed to be dense! The trouble with an experience like this is that you end up being intolerant of everything, because basically you feel ripped off. Oh and also, when we checked in we left our luggage at the hotel until the room was ready and I asked if it was put in a same room as one of the pieces wasn't locked \"no, we'll put it out in the road\" was the reply.

So I walked in there and opened the door to this small room and a loud noise. So I called recpetion and said there is a loud noise coming from my fridge and the TV had a puple tinge. Another phone call to recpetion and 45 minutes later a porter came over and had a look, luckly the TV was just a loose connection so that was sorted out, how ever the fridge was opened and closed twice and then I was told that the porter would speak to the shift manager Another 45 minutes past and I had no reply from the porter, so again I phoned recetion to find out what was going on, the recpetist said they would find out, and again suprise suprise I had no responce from recpetion. So I deceided to order some food, I looked over the very limited menu and decided to have soup of the day (Which turned out to be the soup of the week) and a crusty roll and Haddock, Think cut chips and a wedge of lemon. So I asked how long this would take, 20 to 25 mins the girl said at the other end of the phone. 45 minutes later the food finally arived. I could of done better with my microwave. I started on my soup and I relised Ihave no roll, so yet again back on the phone again and my roll never turned up. At about 8:15 I had several issues, 1) My fridge was still making a very loud noise, and I had no response from the porter the came to look at my issue 2) My bread roll never appeared So I called the duty manager, and he told me that I would be moved in to a different room. The shift manager then said some one would be over, after waiting until 9pm I turned the fridge off an went to bed. Tuesday, Final some that was Ok, Breakfast! the sausages was a bit under done but all in all It was quite good. Tuesday Evening, I come back from work and the fridge was still not working and then to add to my pain the TV channels had stopped working, I called up recpetion and they said that someone will be over, to my suprise no one come until my food come.

They eventually said that the plumbing issue was in the other side of the hotel and they were worried that it would spread. Fair enough, but the people checking in next to us were being moved because there was an electrical issue!! Over the course of the 5 nights we constantly heard guests being told they were being moved to other hotels for a whole host of reasons. I emailed the General Manager asking for an explanation but only got a generic 'sorry' email. Maybe the complaint I have just emailed to Best Western might get better results.

There is hard line internet in the rooms but mine wasn't working but my colleagues was.

No chance. I was in the basement where room numbers had no logical sequence (even the staff member could find it) The room itself was tiny just enough space to walk around it. In fairness it was clean and very well decorated with a good size TV. The bathroom was very well presented as well but completely impractical. Whoever designs these rooms has no idea what they are used for. The toilet is so close to wall it is practically impossible to use either standing in front or sitting on it. The toilet roll holder is fitted in front of the toilet and is level with the front of the toilet. There are 2 decorative lights which stick out from above the sink. When you use the shower you have duck to miss them. As with each stay in Shaftebury Hotels I find the shaver point did not work. Neither did the telephone which meant I had to go up to reception to tell them there was no iron and ironing board. I then had to go up a second time when no iron and board was brought down. On the second evening I found the door did not auto close when a man walk into my room. He did not knock or announce himself, he just walked in. He said my door was open and left.

I was using points for the room and this was the only BW available in a good locale for our trip. Of course, after reading other reviews I was alarmed about the potential for bed bugs in this hotel. Comments regarding small rooms, etc didn't bother me as we were not planning on staying in our room much. But, bed begs are another issue altogether so I emailed Vinayak, the manager to express my concern and ask if the problem has been resolved. I was assured of a \"guaranteed\" good stay and told proper extermination was ongoing. This hotel has a great location, it's staff seems to be working very hard although they are in a learning curve for sure. We were shown to a room which was very nice, recently updated, and very clean. We had a great three days in London. However, about five days after arriving back in the US both my 20 year old daughter and I developed bed bug bites. I had the wrong impression that a bed bug bite would show immediately upon being bitten. Bites can show up as long as 9 days after being bitten. That way, unfortunately, you can get bitten a lot. At 6 p.m. on Tuesday I noticed 3 bites on my knee. By the next day I had over 100 on my body from jawline to toes. My daughter had less, but her arms and face were bitten and itched terribly. We both have been to a doctor and are taking steroids & prescription antihistamine. I have had an exterminator in my home to make sure no bugs travelled with us. He went through my bedrooms, bedding, and luggage with a flashlight. He told me it would cost $1,000 US dollars to treat my home if they were found. Thankfully, as of right now there is no evidence of any. The exterminator did tell me it would be difficult to say where I was exposed as it can happen on airplanes, really any kind of public transportation, and I did stay in another hotel in Paris during our visit. However, the hotel in Paris does not (on Tripadvisor anyway) have any indication of bed bugs. This Best Western does have a history of complaints of bed bugs. This review tells it like it is. This is a very good location, very clean, staff trying to do a good job and very friendly. I didn't see evidence of bed bugs in the room (although I should have looked better & educated myself more), and can't say for certain my bites are from staying here. My belief, however, is that they are and I would not stay here again. Nor recommend to others. It's too big a risk for the problems and stress we have gone through.

I had never stayed in a Best Western, but had tons of points due to my husband's Diner's Club account. Our stay was free and this was the only Best Western that was available in central London. The manager, Vinayak, replied very quickly and specifically addressed the bed bug problem and said it had been addressed. He also said he would personally guarantee a good stay. My husband also called him and asked for reassurance, which he gave. When we arrived it was early and our room was not yet ready. We left our luggage for storage and went out to see the city. When we returned we were given the wrong luggage, but it was quickly remedied and we received our own. The bellman was just going to hand us our luggage and be off, but I asked if he would take it to our room. We had large bags which were heavy and there are steps off the lobby. He did help and I tipped him. The room was on the lowest level and was nice. It has obviously been updated not too long ago. Although I never met Vinayak as he was off-duty when we checked in and I never asked for him again, he did ensure we had a complimentary fruit basket and some wine and water in our room. This was very nice after a long day of travel and sight-seeing. The room was quiet although we could hear everything through the walls when there was someone in an adjacent room. The beds are hard and so are the pillows. There were other pillows in the closet and those were softer. There were robes, slippers, a refrigerator, coffee, and lots of bath amenities. The room was very clean and no problems with bed bugs. The free wi-fi worked great and so did the television. I called for a wake up call, which was right on.

I would recommend staying here, but due to inexperience of staff and other poor reviews, would be diligent about requesting a proper room.

At first glace we were optimistic as the building and reception was very nice. A friendly porter helped us with our bags and showed us to check in. At check in things were a little different, the member of staff we dealt with was very blazay and told us that although we had booked a twin room they were unable to supply us with one for the night as a pipe had broken and there was a bad smell in one area of the hotel. We were given the option to either take a double room or move to a different hotel. As my friend was pregnant I thought that they could have been a little more flexible and maybe offered us some sort of upgrade to a larger room so that she was more comfortable. As it was for one night we decided to stay and were allocated a double room on the ground floor. When we entered the room it was extremely hot, dark, dingy, dirty in places and the window was wide open, it soon became apparent that the air conditioning was not working. we called for assitance twice and shorly after the second call someone was sent to check and agreed that it was infact not working. We asked to be moved to another room and said that we were not happy, especially as we were already compromising on what we had booked, the same member of staff on reception was a little defensive but we were immediately shown to a another room, this although no bigger was at least cooler. When returning to the hotel after the concert we tried to arrange room service which we were told was not available after 12pm (drinks only) which was a little disapointing as it did clearly say on the menu in the lift in the hotel that paninis, sandwiches etc were available 'round the clock'. Overall our stay was not terrible, the beds were comfortable and the decor although a little tired was nice enough but the rooms were just far too small, I would think it would be impossible for someone larger to even get into the shower cubical!

Our room however was an entirely different story. Our room (222) was set away from the main building off a spur from the starwells. The hallway that led to it was damp and pungent with a rooftop service door that seemed to keep making itself open up to the elements. When we arrived in our cupboard, sorry, room, not only did the tiny size take us back but also the appaling state of repair in which it is kept. The double bed filled the width of the space so that it could only be enetered from one side with the other side jutting up to the window. A modern plasma television adorned the foot end wall that was so flimsily installed and unprofessinally wired (all cables hanging under the TV) that I feared it may fall on my legs in the night. The wardrobe door was hanging off at one side, the curtains were gaping from the inadequate plastic rail and dragged on the floor making them awkward to open and close, even if they did meet in the middle, which they did not. The window was either wide open (no safety restraints) or tight shut and had a habit of flinging itself open at the slightest adjustment. The radiator cover under the window was smashed in multiple places and the wall adjacent was scuffed and scratched as though someone's bootheel had been used to keep the ripped wallpaper in place. Although we were surprised that a shower room could fit in such a tiny space, one had been shoehorned in and although judging by it's size it could have been designed by NASA it was obviously fitted by morons. The shower rail holding the shower head was swinging freely from the tiles. The shower itself dribbled a pathetic amount of water at a miserable speed making it impossible to wash your hair with the nicely provided toiletries. The shower needed a serious clean, it looked as though it had seen little but a wipe with a damp cloth for quite some time. The shower cubicle was set nearly a foot off the ground and this combined with the stairwell access and the bed positioning would make the room almost unusable to a more elderly couple. Our initial stop in the room was brief as we were in a hurry to make it out to the city to meet with friends. We were never asked at checkout whether our stay was pleasant or if everything was to our liking.

The hotel staff treated us superbly. Part of this was because there was a high ratio of staff to guests, but it was more than this. The hotel prides itself on its service, and this is evident in many ways. For example, Sunday was a down day for us as we accustomed ourselves to the time change by remaining in our room for most of the day. We had expected that our room would not be made up that day \u2013 as would certainly be the case in most any other hotel.

However, there is still some space to improve, both with regard to the variety and quality of the food. But if you only stay for 2 or 3 days, it will be completely ok. The service was very good. I remember one employee who was truly exceptional. If you stay at this hotel, look out for Antony Livera from Sri Lanka. He made my stay much more comfortable: always a friendly smile on his face, he immediately remembered my name (even after a few days), gave me lots of valuable pieces of information about sights and tours in London and always asked how he could improve my stay. Since there are not too many employees at this hotel, you will easily find him. The reception staff was also friendly, especially the manager who seemed to be in charge (unfortunately, I don\u2019t remember his name), though one guy seemed a little grumpy. The only big disappointment was the gym: three treadmills (nothing else!) were stored in a tiny locked-up room.

She awoke in discomfort to find that she'd been bitten all over. I discovered hundreds of bed bugs on and around the bed, several that I killed being full of human blood. We left our room immediately and informed the reception staff. Each of the five we spoke to, and later the deputy manager also, told us that this was the first complaint of its type and they were unaware of the problem. After insisting that this was an extremely serious public health problem, and that they were entirely culpable, due to insufficient cleaning, etc, of subjecting customers to potentially serious health risks, and to a high likelihood of transporting difficult-to-eradicate parasites back to their homes, they thoughtfully offered us a free breakfast, and ice to put on the lesions. After further complaining, they agreed to consider a refund. The next morning, the deputy manager took us to his office and agreed to a full refund. He also reaffirmed that this was a one-off incident of a previously unknown infestation, agreed that this was a serious problem for which they were responsible and that he would have it dealt with immediately. Unfortunately, I have since googled for reviews of the hotel mentioning \"bed bugs\" and have discovered that there have been regular complaints of bed bugs at this hotel, and other hotels belonging to the same chain, dating back to 2007, with similar stories of denial of the problem and promises to deal with it through the proper channels. One reviewer stated that just last month this exact issue had been brought to the attention of the reception staff, this being the same staff that a month later systematically assured me that they had never had such a complaint and were as such unaware of the issue. I can only assume that the probability of having employed a new set of staff, or the staff being inexplicably forgetful is sufficiently low for me to justifiably assert that this hotel employs a protocol of dishonestly denying the problem, and as such disrespecting their customers and disregarding their safety and health. I am both insulted and disgusted by this. Insulted because as a hotel, it is their very basic duty to respect their customers by not actively deceiving them by lying to them and regularly acting out a collective performance of surprise at learning of a \"new\" pest problem. Disgusted because in all likelihood this hotel is responsible for thousands of homes around the world becoming infested with these parasites. As such, this is a hotel that poses a serious risk to public health (do not stay if you don't like any of the following: having your blood sucked; potentially contracting a variety of serious diseases; very possibly carrying eggs back to your home), has known about it for at least four years, has not dealt with it effectively, has voluntarily entered contracts with and taken money from customers whilst aware that their hotel can compromise their health, knowingly lied to customers about knowledge of the problem. If you have problems concerning dishonestly-run, parasite-infested hotels, I strongly advise against staying at this hotel. I also strongly advise websites such as this not to facilitate the business of such hotels. Fortunately, environmental health and trading standards are now investigating these issues.", "Date": "May 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cA good one for the solo traveller\u201d", "Author": "RicardoSarre", "ReviewID": "UR108403509", "Content": "This hotel is right near the Lancaster Gate tube stop and very near Hyde Park.

Upon arrival, we wanted to check in, stash our bags in our room and go drop off the mess of a car (see Kendal) to Hertz at the airport. No parking of course, hence us getting rid of the car. The front desk was busy, but moving swiftly. I checked in and the clerk detailed a porter to help unload and get us into our \"suite\" across the street from the lobby. We had done our reading and knew the setup although we had never been there before. Got the car unloaded, jumped back in the car, returned car to Hertz and rode the \"Heathrow Express\" to Paddington Station--ridiculoulsy fast and easy. The staff at the front desk was going through some new front desk clerks, and some training was going on, but never without an \"adult\" trainer to take over. They worked quickly and tried hard to get us what we wanted/needed very quickly. They were always polite and never rude. The porters were hard-working and polite. The breakfast room personnel were hard-working and polite as well. Across the street, in the \"Suites\", we had our own key to the building and our suite, plus there was a small elevator. The room was rather charming-an anteroom with a large closet for coats, clothes, ironing board, etc, and also held the main thermostat. From the anteroom, through another door was our room. Very quiet, usually. We had lovely high ceilings and windows with billowiy drapes in a gorgeous bronze polysilk that went all the way to the ceiling, with sheers under. There was a desk, thoughtfully outfitted for computer or writing use. There were two different chairs for comfortable sitting and a tiny kitchenette for anything we brought to put in there! Lovely tea setup and plates, utinsils, etc. All very handy and just what we needed! The bath was clean, very modern and the shower was awesome!

When I read the reviews on here we still thought we should stay in the hotel simply because there wasn't much choice. The service was POOR all round. When we first arrived we were made to queue for 15 minutes whilst one staff argued with a group of men. Then I had to try and get the attention of another staff who just walked passed us. After 2 attempts to get SOME attention, I shouted 'excuse me' and I was forced to ask them why there was only one staff behind the counter. FINALLY a staff member bothered themselves to get behind the counter and start attending to the queue. We were given our key cards and told to go across the road to our rooms. We had no staff actually showing us the building and we had to come back and ask for assistants. After dragging our suitcases to the third floor, we entered an ok sized room with a king size bed. The big bed was very unnecessary and took up most of the room, the bed felt comfortable. The bathroom was very small (the toilet and shower were in the same tiny room).

If you can avoid it, don't stay at this hotel, unless you don\u2019t mind standoffish staff. Best advice I can give the hotel is to employ professional staff, from my experience an ok hotel can be uplifted by having friendly, helpful staff and make the experience worth while. I can honestly say had the staff been friendly and helpful (or even cared about the fact that we were staying there) we wouldn't have been so quick to want to leave.

The issues I had with the hotel were as follows: When we arrived, they did not have all the booking details (we had booked on Wotif.com). We were supposed to have : Mini fridge with complimentary drinks including half bottle of wine; flowers; fruit basket. None of the above were on their booking records, so we waited half an hour or so for the room to be readied. When we got to the room, we found that: there was no fridge! Apparently NO rooms have fridges because of some accident once upon a time. I can't recall the last time I stayed at a reasonable hotel that did not have a mini fridge. So we had the drinks, but they were room temperature. The barman only had one ice bucket when I asked for ice in the evening, so I could only keep that for a little while. The half bottle of wine was actually a quarter bottle. The room was small and too warm for me, but the heater wouldn't go completely off, and the separate room air conditioner wasn't very effective - not cold enough. We ended up with both of these running all the time but it wasn't particularly successful. The room was very small - normal for London hotels though, I guess - and became even smaller because we split the double into two single beds. The so-called English Breakfast was actually just access to their buffet which was very ordinary limited and not great quality, soggy pastries. A pity because the loved the English food during the rest of our trip. On the positive side, the staff were all very helpful.

On arrival, the staff were very polite and friendly, and we were able to book in early although we would have 20 minutes wait whilst the maid finished cleaning. We decided to have a drink whilst we waited. So the doorman came to the bar to serve us, but I don't think this was his forte. By the time we got our drinks, the room was ready so we took our drinks to our ground floor room. The corridor leading to the room was like an oven, even though the weather had turned mild and this was so unneccesary. I was very disappointed with the so-called deluxe \"Club Room\". It would have to be a very small, exclusive club to fit in there! The bed was two 3/4 beds pushed together, thus taking up most of the minute room. Because of the bed, only one of the wardrobe doors would open. There was a nice unit where the tea/coffee things were, with a top cupboard containing a microwave, 2 plates and some glasses. The cupboard underneath was obviously for the fridge, but this was missing. Again, the room was suffocatingly hot so we turned the heater off. There was an airconditioning unit but the flap was missing and a live wire had been wrapped with blue tape. It was dripping on the carpet. The bathroom was adequate but very small, although fairly well equipped with soaps, shampoos etc. Only one hand towel between us though. There were 2 chairs in the room, but we couldn't put them together to sit as there was no room. 1 chair was squeezed into a corner and the other was at the desk unit. The view from the window was over next door's derelict garden and the backs of the neighbouring houses, so I guess we were luckier than the people in rooms below us who would only have a wall a couple of feet away from their window. When I pulled the curtains, one of them started to come off as there was no stop on the end of the curtain rail. In the advertising blurb it stated free internet. We had considered taking our laptop, but since we were on a short break, decided against it. If we had taken it, there were connection wires, but the huge flatscreen TV (unnecessary in such a small room) had internet so we tried that, only to find that if you wanted to use it or any of the other services (film, games etc) the charge was \u00a320 per day regardless of usage. Flowers and fruit were advertised as being part of the package with a large fruit bowl shown - we had 3 carnations, 1 orange and 1 apple which weren't topped up, the same as the biscuits.

We booked a double club room that promised fruit, flowers, mini fridge, mineral water and wine. Oh and slippers! The picture looked spacious. Room 1- We were greeted just by asking for booking order, given room key and that was all. Not told where or when breakfast was etc. Got to the room..was tiny! Had 5 carnations in a vase (unlike the vast plumage of flowers from the picture) 4 pieces of fruit in a cheap wicker basket, no mini fridge, 2 small bottles of water and a tiny bottle of wine. The wardrobe door would not open because it was close to the bed and the bathroom you couldnt turn around in. The bed was two singles pushed together. We went down to reception to complain. There were no apologies and we were told all the fridges had been removed for safety! This was annoying as we had brought sandwiches for a day off which we planned to keep in the fridge. So we got moved to a \"bigger room\" and that was all. Room 2- This room was tinier! It had an actual double bed but same small flowers and fruit. It had 3 cans of coke (room 1 had 2) but no safety box, damp dressing gowns, no slippers and the room was so dark. There were hairs in the bathroom which was bigger but we still felt this was not the 4* room we had bought. Looking at the room paln on the back of the door all the rooms around us were bigger. so back down we went again! Reception didnt apologise and said these were there biggest rooms!!! We stayed in a holiday inn express in Hamilton that was 3 times as big for half the price. I know London hotels are smaller but ive been in larger 2* rooms! Room 3- Room 3 was not much bigger but had better lighting. The bed was 2 singles pushed together. But this room had 2 bottles of wine! We settled because we were too tired to keep fighting. We could open the wardrobe and the bathroom was slightly bigger. We went out and brought back a pizza to find the microwave was broken and the plug said it was last tested 2008! Went to ask for a new one to be told sorry...we can heat it up inn kitchen..which defeats the point!!!! In the morning i looked for the hair dryer to find it missing.I rang reception who told me it was in the drawer so i said it wasn't and i wanted it asap. I was greeted by a bus boy who didnt say good morning simply went \"there WILL be one in your drawer and to return it asap!\" HOW RUDE!!!! we left for the day and said a microwave better be waiting. To some up- They did replace the microwave but that was all. We had no slippers as advertised. Chocolates left on the bed at night happened 1 out of the 4 nights. Staff never really said hello or were helpful. The location is great, 5 min walk to paddington and the breakfast is good but if you want pastries get there early. Oh and they only have skimmed milk which means unless you like grey tea in the morning avoid! On check out we looked under the bed to find a pair of socs and lots of vanity items which really grossed us out! All 3 rooms were missing something from \"the list\" and this annoyed us. Some rooms had 5 pieces of fruit, some had 3 cans, some 2 bottles of wine, some had a hairdryer, some had wine glasses, some had bathroom scales, some safety boxes. The point is ALL rooms should have the same (all the club rooms). Oh yes the club lounge is a small \"ailse\" with a few chairs and a computor..hardly exclusive feeling! The maid waited outside our room most days and dived in as we left which made us feel bad for wanting a lie in some days. Most the staff never apologised or greeted us and when we raised issues seemed to not care. For a 4* hotel this was a waste of money.

I called reception to tell them, and at the same time took advantage of their free wi-fi to take a look at recent reviews of the hotel. Bed-bug reports were present. Reception called back and I alerted them of my concerns. They assured me they did not have a problem with bed-bugs (although later admitted that their other rooms in the building across the street had had a bed-bug problem that they had 'taken care of'). They offered to move me to another room regardless, which I accepted. I undertook a thorough inspection of the new room and found a live bed-bug, which I duly took upstairs to reception and showed the hotel manager. There was some surreptitious glances between staff and managers, a whispered conversation, and then the manager asked me to go outside for a chat. I insisted on being moved from the building, was offered a room at a sister hotel around the corner, refused, was offered a room at the Best Western Kensington, reluctantly accepted this 'final offer'. I glanced with sympathy at the happy customers still entering the lobby to check in, wishing I had the courage to warn them. Enroute to the Kensignton Best Western l I googled reviews of this hotel and found similar reports. I got out of the cab and stayed at a friends house. I believe this hotel chain is denying rampant reports of the infestation. Their efforts to control the problem have obviously been unsuccessful and night after night innocent victims sleep in their infected beds and carry the bugs back to their houses and families. Spread the word- this hotel chain should be shut down! Their behaviour is disgusting, their actions are based on pure greed, and their victims number in the hundreds, if not thousands.

Uncomfortable and noisy...\u201d", "Author": "Waddingtonswife", "ReviewID": "UR81011650", "Content": "The best thing about this stay was the location, lots of local shops and restaurants and only a short walk to Paddington station. I booked this hotel through a company account and have stayed here before a couple of years ago (for leisure) without a problem. However, this stay was terrible. Check-in was fine and the porter was very nice and showed me to my room which was in a building opposite the main hotel. On the face of it the room seemed practical. However, my first concern was the fact the main door to the building was not secure and I had to walk up numerous flights of stairs to get to my room, not great for a lone female customer. I settled down for the night at around midnight only to be woken by party revellers returning to the hotel at 1am, this isn't unusual in London and I settled back down to return to sleep. However, this continued ALL night and groups of people gathered outside the Reception area opposite as well as underneath my building to smoke, they were drunk and noisy and no attempt to move people on quickly was made by hotel staff. One group would eventually move on, only to be replaced by another. The lumpy, cramped single bed exacerbated my frustration. This continued until 4am, at this time the linen delivery lorries arrived, and taxis and traffic started up. I had gone to London for business and this experience didn't set me up for an expensive, intense 3 day training course that ended with an exam! I made my complaints to Reception during the night, although I had to use the outside line as the internal line to Reception did not connect (they didn't charge me for this). However, they were unable to move me, pretty unsympathetic, and advised it would be dealt with the following morning, there was also no duty manager on call to escalate my problem to. The following day my company spoke with Reception and were advised the hotel couldn't move me without me being present (this contradicted the information from the previous night, and my luggage was packed ready). Upon returning to the hotel at 6pm they had assigned a room in the main hotel which overlooked the same busy Reception area and street. When I politely explained that this room was unsuitable too, the Reception staff were cold and impatient. They reluctantly assigned a further room, again in a building opposite, and the friendly porter took me across to look at it. The room faced a brick wall in the rear and was on the ground floor, brilliant...no noise!! My stay got better at this point but the room was small, the shower door was broken, the shower head was also broken and the previous occupants dirty towel was still in the made up room. The hot/cold indicators on the basin tap were the wrong way round, good job I was just cleaning my teeth otherwise I would have been scalded. Breakfast was lovely and I was in and out quickly. Staff were very pleasant, responsive and friendly in the restaurant. The only solice is that I wasn't paying for this experience personally (\u00a3140 per night I believe!) but I will be speaking to my company advising not to send my colleagues to this 4-star hotel (?!!? more like 2!!). I will be attending further courses in the same place but won't use this hotel again, and neither should you, it's certainly hit and miss and expensive to make that gamble!!", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "devon", "Title": "\u201cwasnt that bad at all!! very helpful service\u201d", "Author": "dykesy", "ReviewID": "UR79521556", "Content": "we stayed at the paddington court shaftesbury and read the reviews the night before leaving, hoping we would be ok. on arrival(very near the station), we werent disappointed, the staff were very helpful.our room was same as, if not bigger than other hotels we have stayed in , and very tidy and clean etc. bottle of wine and coke along with fruit on arrival in the room. the room was airy and nice and clean. the staff the next day(porters) in the lobby were friendly and helped find our tourist attractions on the map.

The room was definitely small and is no way a four star room however the fixtures, fittings and cleanliness were all of a high standard.

The only 4 stars listed were the Hilton Metropole and Hilton Paddington, and I expected to get one of those. I was very wrong! Hotwire has added at least the Shaftsbury Hyde Park International, at 52-55 Inverness Terrace, to its list of 4 stars in this area. From all appearances it is NOT a four star but don\u2019t know for sure since we were turned away at 6 pm on a Saturday afternoon although we held a printed paid booking, with the explanation that \u201ca boiler has broken and since you didn\u2019t book directly with the hotel, you\u2019ll have to call your travel agent\u201d to sort out the situation. About twenty minutes of back and forth resulted in an offer to put us up at another \u201cShaftsbury 4 star\u201d nearby, the Best Western Shaftsbury Paddington Court. An offer was made to get us a car service but we were warned that this would talk at least a half hour. After waiting the half hour, we were ready to walk to the new hotel with our luggage, when the car showed up and drove us quickly to the Best Western Shaftsbury. Things went downhill from here. The Best Western Shaftsbury is listed as a 4 star hotel, even by AA (the British equivalent of AAA) who should know better. Like the Shaftsbury Hyde Park International \u2013 where we were unable to stay \u2013 it is a converted row house in an entire street of perhaps 20 or 25 conversions serving as modest two- and three-star hotels. How the two Shaftsburys got to be listed as four stars is beyond me. Although the experience overall was very disappointing, the pertinent details here are that we were again given rooms with single beds, mine measured approximately 2.5 metres by 3 metres (about 8 feet by 10) barely enough room for the bed and for the door to open. There was no lift / elevator to our rooms on the first (US second) floor, so we lugged our bags up. The air conditioning in my room did not work and the window in the bathroom opened only a crack. The dirty window in the room did not open at all. The carpet was threadbare and the bathroom, which had been outfitted with a new, plastic shower stall too small to bend over in, was tiny, with the sink slightly larger than an A-4 sheet of paper. From what we could tell, the guests at this hotel are backpackers and tour groups. When we were there a busload of about 50 people from Holland checked in, and there were several scruffy but polite backpackers waiting to use the one computer hooked up to the Internet. The staff were all immigrants, which is fine as long as they don\u2019t bring some of their more disagreeable customs with them. When we checked out early on Monday morning, a member of staff offered to get a taxi for us. Since we were right next to a main road with plenty of taxis we told him that wouldn\u2019t be necessary. Nevertheless he barged out into the road, stopped the first cab and had a brief exchange of conversation.

It's a 5-minute walk from Paddington Station, so if you land at Heathrow, you can reach Paddington in 15 minutes, and the hotel in another 5. It's also a few minutes away from Lancaster Gate tube station, which is right in front of Hyde Park /Kensington Gardens. Just 15 minutes away by tube from the heart of shopping: Oxford/Regent Street. The room range is very vast. While they offer only 2-3 types, there's a huge variation within each type (they cost the same, it's just your luck). While the staff are very courteous, they do tend to take you for a ride by overbooking/ giving you a smaller room, and hoping you won't notice/complain. Ive always booked a Double Superior/Deluxe room, but have been sold a crappy single room slightly bigger then a cabinet. I complained, and was moved to a far bigger room the next day. Make it a point to complain specially if you are going to be there for a few days. The rooms themselves (assuming you go for a double deluxe or better) are nice and clean. The beds are very comfortable, and there's free wired broadband in every room (if you are on the lower floors, you may get the wifi signal from the reception). The rooms have LCD TV with IPTV connections, with about 30 FTA channels already available. My room had a coffee/tea maker, hair dryer, and ironing board as well. Other than the bed, there's a small writing table and chair. These rooms are good for yourself, but if you plan to invite someone over, you will probably need to get a bigger room - or meet in the lounge/bar. The hotel provides free toiletries which are fairly decent: one tends to use a lot of moisturizers in London, specially during winters, and their's isn't too bad. There was a bathtub in the attached bathroom in the room I had.. and lots of clean towels, replaced everyday by efficient housekeeping were provided. The breakfast (sometimes included - you'll need to confirm before you eat!!!) is not all that great, and a bit overpriced (about 17 pounds including VAT). You can eat a helluva lot more for that money, and your choice of foods too. For vegetarians, there's very limited stuff, and vegans are basically screwed. The room service can be really, really pathetic - I once ordered food from a takeaway, and then a plate and fork from the hotel, and the food came in much before the plate.

I needed to change my check in time to midnight, so I decided to phone ahead to advise, as I was concerned about arriving so late with the possibility of my room being given to somebodey else. Upon calling the hotel, I received a very abrupt staff member who repeatedly said that the reception was open 24 hours a day and that there was no need to advise. She would not take any details from, not even my name just to appease me. - Upon arrival at midnight, after not eating all day and travelling for about 6 hours, the staff told me that they had no record of my confirmation of stay. Fortunately I had a copy of my confirmation from the website I booked it on. I then had to wait while the very unprofessional reception staff kept running out the back to sort everything out with the Duty Manager. I may as well have been standing at the counter of McDonalds. I then asked if the hotel had anywhere that I could eat, even if only a snack and I was told there were no facilities but I could order a take-away pizza! - 1/2 an hour later my room was sorted out. They told me that my booking had not been updated in their system which is why they couldn't find out, despite my confirmed booking being made 3 days earlier. - The staff at check in did not tell me of any of the the facilities at the hotel or any near by attractions. I asked if I could arrange a late check out for the next day, (only an hour was required), only to receive the response, \"Late check out, what is a late check out\"? I then had to explain to the staff what is was. When I told them, they said there was no problem and that I could check out an hour later the following day. - The room was already prepaid but they requested a further \u00a310.00 for incidentals after they had just told me that I could not obtain any food or drinks in the room or at their bar area. Of course if I wanted breakfast, that would be extra so what could I possibly accrue another \u00a310.00 worth of incidentals on? - The room, although having nice decor, was ridiculously small. I was tripping myself and I was the only one in there. The room I had was allegedly the, \"club double room\", this means that it's supposed to be on eof their biggest rooms. I wouldn't want to see what a single room looks like. I had to sit on the toilet to reach the rubbish bin that was under the sink in the bathroom. The shower was extremely small, if you're a tall or wide person you might be able to get in there but good luck moving your body around trying to have a wash. - There was some complimentary tea, coffee, drinks, biscuits and fruit in the room but nobody told me that they were complimentary. Everything was also at room temperature, as there wasn't a mini fridge/ minibar in the room. - By this time, it was now about 1:30am, so I went off to wonder the streets of Paddington looking for something to eat. - Next morning, the Cleaner is knocking on my door at 12:01pm. Through the door I explained that I had a late check and that I would be ready in about 20 minutes, to which I received a response of, \"okay\". Then literally 3 minutes later, I had a knock on the by the Duty Manager asking me if I was checking out today! I told her that I had arranged a late check out with reception the night before to which she said she wasn't informed. Never again will I stay in the 2 star hotel!

MINUS OF THIS HOTEL : _ Average size of rooms : were they designed according to UK Prison Cell Standards? _ Rooms based in the basement to be avoided (machinery noises a large part of the night + quite dark even during day time...); _ You must not suffer from claustrophobia if you plan in staying in one of their rooms. Some previous guests seemed to have suffered of a panic attack, judging by some scratches on the room walls... _ Technical Problems : shortage of water at peak time in the morning, right at the moment when you need to get ready for an important meeting; electricity breakdown during the night : alarm clock not working; ice in the freezer and fridge had melted, transforming my room in a Little Venice... _ Not designed for Business Activities : very old and not functioning internet connection. Based on the spots found on the carpet, one's may suppose that a Pigeon Message System is more likely to be found in this hotel... _ Some breakfast staff, obviously coming for another country than the UK, not understanding words such as \"plate\", \"spoon\", \"cup\", cleaning tables\", \"smiling\", \"being helpful\"... _ Incompetent reception Staff : they allocated me a room where a lady was already staying. I felt a bit ashamed asking her if she had finished cleaning the room... When I had to go all the way down to reception a 2nd time because my 2nd room key was not working, the Reception Staff tried to charge me a 2nd time the price of the stay that I had already paid before even getting my room in the morning... _ Very narrow and unclean Bathroom.

The room itself (a kitchenette suite) was smaller than the two star hotel I had stayed at on Belgrave Road.

The cabinet where I was supposed to put my clothes was wedged in so tightly between the wall and the end table next to the bed, that I could barely open it.

She blamed it all on Last Minute saying that they did not have any rooms that were 4* (even though this is clearly advertised on their website). She said that our options were to either take different rooms (that were only slightly bigger in size and not much better at all) or to get a full refund.

Good television set and clean stylish bedding and free broadband (and its quick). The service is ok and far from the worst and again it is all reflected in the price (book via the Shaftesbury group website for great prices \u00a375 for a deluxe double). The breakfast is fantastic for the money (the acid test for any in England is the sausages and bacon and they are good here and not the usual 'frozen' fair).

The doors were all held open by fire extinguishers, hoovers left permanently in corridors, tatty door frames, ripped carpets. DEFINITELY not a 4 star. We walked up many stairs to get to the 3rd floor as the lift only went to the lower floors and when we finally reached our room with our suitcases in tow we realized that we had been given a twin room instead of a double room. So back we returned down the stairs and informed the man behind the desk politely and in a clam manner about the mix up.Only to be met with a rude response. Basically we were told that the hotel is very popular and we were lucky to even have a room (I am not joking these were his words!). He also said that the hotel had tried to contact all the people that this had happened to but the numbers had not been working (which did not sound very believable) Finally he agreed to giving us a twin room the following day. We stayed in the double room that night and it was TINY! Pretty much only space for a double bed which was so small I was afraid to turn as I might knock my friend off!!

The new room was bigger but still dark and dingy apart from the bathroom as mentioned before. HOWEVER............ it was in this room that I was bitten by BED BUGS. I did not realize that this had happened to me until I had returned home as the bites appeared then (they can appear up to 9 days later). I had to hoover my whole room, mattress, bed frame, suitcase, all of the furniture, wash and dry everything that I had with me at a high heat in case any of these critters had returned with me but I was very lucky that they hadn't because they are a nightmare to get rid of. The bites have still not healed and are very itchy and I cannot believe that untop of everything else this happened to me. It is so disgusting.

She asked them to keep our room, but were asked to pay 1 1/2 the amount we had been paying for three days (they finally knocked the price down, but we still payed more). My wife also asked them, rather politely, if they could move a huge bouquet of flowers sitting right next to her on the reception desk because of the rather pungent smell, which was bothering her, and was told that she would get used to it, that \"it would pass\"... all in all, an unfortunate experience.

The reviews were wrong and I suggest you heed my advice. I paid extra to get a deluxe room but there was nothing deluxe about what I was given. The cons are as follows: Star rating: The hotel sells itself as a 4 star and in the past I have experienced many hotels ranging from 2 to 5 star. Of the 4 star rated hotels I have experienced they have all been reasonably good and often provide you with the comfort and quality of a 5 star with slightly inferior finishing and fewer facilities. In this case however the hotel would more realistically be categorised as a mediocre 3 star. On this ground I was disappointed as the Shaftesbury did not live up to the standard you'd expect from a 4 star hotel in any sense of the term. State of room: The room was in the basement floor. There was marginal natural lighting and you had no view. There was something resembling a sky light that was apparently what made the room habitable. The carpets were a disgrace, there were marks all over them, they were worn, stained and grubby looking. The television remote did not work, except to change channel but no volume control or standby function worked. The room was stuffy due to poor ventilation and no window you could reach to open. The crockery for the complimentary tea was mismatched. The complimentary soap in the shower was empty. The minibar smelled like farts (seriously it did) and there was nothing in it except two lonely bottles of water. The safe was locked and could not be opened to store valuables in. The shower did not have adequate water guards and water would splash off you onto the toilet and toilet floor. Staff: with the exception of one receptionist they were indifferent to you, would not greet you as you entered the rather intimate lobby and would barely acknowledge you upon approaching their counter. They were not overtly rude but they were falling far short of the standard you would expect from a so called 4 star hotel's staff. Overall condition: The hotel had the fascade of style but it was cheaply done and already there were signs of detiroration from the marked up walls in the corridor to the disgraceful state of the room we were allocated. Facilities: The gym was a glorified home gym with very few machines. The lack of space or windows was also oppressive. i did not use any other facility but there didn't appear to be many in any event. There was no lift down to the basement level which meant we had to carry our luggage down/up on check-in and check out. I could have used the porter but chose not to. The point remains that the Shaftesbury is allocating rooms in it's basement that lack sufficient natural light, a lift and proper ventilation. All in all it was tacky, tired, psuedo-stylish, poorly kept, poorly presented, poorly attended and just generally rubbish. The only good points were its location and selection of television channels. However, these are not selling points as the area is full of similarly convenient hotels at a lower price and of a similar quality. Why should I pay extra for a 4 star that doesn't deliver when I could save the bulls**t and get a more honest 3 star for less money?", "Date": "March 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cawfull beware this place was disgusting\u201d", "Author": "lilli67", "ReviewID": "UR25847784", "Content": "we stayed in a basement room across from the main hotel the room was so tiny, the bed was hard and dirty and the bathroom was filthy.

The rooms in the building with the front desk are much nicer than the rooms in the building across the street. This may explain why some reviewers were very happy with their rooms and others hated theirs. The guests in the nice building probably have no idea that the building across the street even exists. I reserved what was supposed to be a 4 star room for what was supposed to be a greatly discounted $139 pounds per night (plus an additional $20 pounds tax). Like many others staying in this area, we had an early flight out of Heathrow and wanted to be close to Paddington station. We checked in, and to reach our room, were directed to a completely different building across the street. The building was musty, our room was in the basement, the room had a damp smell, and there were stains on the walls. It was so small that we could barely move. There was no space for the (stained!) ironing board, so it was propped up against a wall. For $70 pounds a night, we probably would have stayed, but this was definitely not a 4 star hotel, definitely not worth $159 pounds/night. The elevator that had taken us down to the basement would not take us back up, so we had to drag our bags up the stairs, then walk back to the front desk to complain about the room. We were told that the hotel was booked, but when we refused our room, were shown another room. This one was slightly less musty, but not a whole lot better, definitely not 4 star. The bellhop who showed us these rooms said that every time guests received rooms across the street, they complained. \"Every time!\" he said, shaking his head. We refused this second room as well, and were eventually shown a room in 27 Devonshire Ter, the building that the front desk is in. This was a perfectly acceptable room, probably the 4 star room that we had reserved to begin with, but we were so upset by our treatment that we left. There are a number of budget hotels in the area, and we picked the first one we found, the Lawrence Hall Hotel, for $85 pounds/night (including tax and breakfast). It had the feel of a youth hostel, but our room was spacious and we were treated well.

When I'd looked at these before I think I'd managed to work out one or two of the hotels and they looked good, so I thought why not try it this time. It wasn't quite the loaction I wanted but neither was it too inconvenient, so not too bad there. The lobby seemed okay too, although the person checking me in seemed more concerned with the person he picked up the phone to half way through checking me in - so rude! I was told that my room was down one floor. i double checked...down one floor? Yes, apparently that was the case. The explanation? It's a clubroom...whatever that was supposed to mean. Hey, maybe it means it's big enough to hire out for events and stuff? No, unfortunately not...it was pretty small. And being in the basement you had the feeling that a) it wasn't secure, and b) people were looking down on you from street level. It also suffered from lack of light, although the big wondow did go some way to remedying that. Shame the catch on it wasn't secure. I didn't feel happy leaving my stuff in the room to go out and get some food. And wasn't hugely happy about sleeping in the room either for that matter! Oh well, maybe I'll just stay in my room for the evening and use the facilities. Mini bar first...totally empty. So it looks like I'll have to go out and get some stuff to eat and drink after all. Oh well, I can at least browse the web first. No...that didn't work either. Fine I'll just go out now, get some food, come back and watch a film. Nope...movies weren't working either. Great! My only other real gripe about the room was the bathroom. It was very small, although that was less annoying than the fancy sink/tap combo. I've had one of those free standing sinks myself so know they're more form over function, but this one had a water spout that protruded out of the wall almost entirely over the sink, so wetting your face to shave, cleaning your teeth, whatever, it was a pain to use and ended up with water all over the place. Breakfast was okay and the dining room staff were friendly enough, although i was put on a table and then told to help myself at the buffet, only to come back to my table to find they'd subsequently also sat someone else there. *sigh* Won't be going back, and probably won't use LastMinute's Top Secret Hotels again either, although I have heard people having good experiences from them.

First, the good things about the hotel: nice plasma TV in the room. There are quiet rooms facing out the rear of the building if you can get one. 3 minute walk to Paddington station for access to the Heathrow Express and the London Underground. Now for the litany of the things that went wrong that made me feel this is a real dump. 1. I reserved a room starting Monday and leaving Friday. On Monday afternoon London time, I called the hotel from the States and explained that I would be arriving around 6 a.m. Tuesday morning but that I was willing to pay from Monday night to insure that I could have access to a room when I arrived on the red eye from California. I arrived Tuesday morning and was told that I didn\u2019t have a room. When I showed my confirmation papers I was told that \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, this reservation was for yesterday and you did not show up.\u201d After a small hissy fit with the manager, it turns out they had plenty of rooms and I was given one. 2. I requested a quiet room facing out the rear of the building. I was given a room below ground facing the front street. I tried to take a nap but the constant footsteps out the window made it difficult. 3. There was no remote for the TV. 4. The internet access was broken in that room 5. There was no hot water. I had to take an ice cold shower. 6. In the ice cold shower, the handle came off and the shower would not turn off. (I am pretty handy and tried to fix it but to no avail. 7. I tried to call the desk to tell them the water would not turn off. The phone seemed to be broken (turns out that you have to dial \u201c851\u201d to get the operator but there is no instruction in the room or on the phone. You can only find that out by asking the desk. So, that evening I asked for the manager again and explained the difficulties and I received a new room. In the new room: 1. The tea kettle did not work. I called the desk and asked for a replacement. They said it would come right away. By 2 hours later and a second call, no kettle. ON the way out for the day I stopped by the desk and gave a written request to have the kettle replaced. 2. In the middle of the night (2 AM), the air conditioning condensate tube overflowed. The a/c/ is high on the wall and water just came pouring out drenching the wall and the desk beneath it. On the desk was my cell phone charging \u2013 now soaked. 3. When I returned in the evening, same old non-working kettle. I called the desk again and asked for a replacement. A few minutes later a bellman showed up with a nice plate of tea bags but no kettle. I brought him into the room, handed the entire kettle tray to him and asked him to leave and return with a new one. About ten minutes later he did. 4. Internet was dead as a door nail. Called the desk, they said they\u2019d reboot the system. Still dead. Now in day 3 with no internet access. 5. For some inexplicable reason, the plasma TV that worked just fine in the new room went haywire. The remote quit working all together. The TV had 30 or so channels the first day now only had 6 channels. I pushed every button I could find but no luck. I complained at the front desk and they said they\u2019d get it fixed. When I returned to the room that evening it worked fine \u2013 until the next morning when it went out again. 6. That final morning found that the housekeepers took all the shampoo and soap and left none in the room \u2013 not even the half empties from the day before. So, bottom line is that the desk people are very friendly and nice but nothing works in this place and no one seems capable of fixing anything.

I was booked into this property by my company. When I found out, I immediately came to Trip Advisor to see what I was in for and I was dreading my arrival here based on what I read....for no good reason it seems (as I write this review from the hotel). it's perfectly pleasant and adequate for business or holiday requirements. By area: Reception: Average - I never expect anyone in London service roles to speak great English and the guy here didn't. But my reservation was in place and the process was as expected. Access: Americans beware - it never looks flashy accessing your room in a converted mansion hotel! The hallways are narrow, the fire doors are a nuisance and it's basically a rabbit warren. Stay at the Hilton if this bothers you - it's standard even in good hotels in the UK! It was no worse here than other properties, and better than many. For the record, the lift was working fine, although I acknowledge the many reviewers here who have said it wasn't during their stays. Room: Yes they're small. But only when compared with American or Australian rooms. This one is small, but has a microwave, sink, refrigerator and basic equipment to allow me to buy dinner at Sainsbury's and heat it up myself., Wood floors, recently renovated and a modern bathroom - doesn't lack for anything except perhaps a new bed (this one is a little saggy, but sleepable and clean). Amenities: Free broadband internet access is a must for business travellers (which I am) so this was great. And there's proper air conditioning as opposed to the usual groaning radiator in need of a bullet to put it out of its misery. While the hotel doesn't have room service or any particularly useful amenities within its walls, it's only seconds walk to Craven Road/Craven Hill with all shopping/eating needs easily met. Five minutes to Paddington Station (or two others) in a very affluent part of London. The location is superb! Safe, easy to walk around and Reception is happy to provide maps free of charge for those who don't come packing their London A-Z. From groceries to cafes to pharmacies to boutiques, nothing is more than two or three minutes from the hotel. And if you're prepared to walk for 10 mins or take a bus, the amazing Edgeware Road shopping is imminently accessible. Overall: Service is never brilliant in London and rooms are never large. But as a business traveller who has had mostly dreadful experiences with hotels in London, I'd say that this one is perfectly acceptable and reflects adequate value for money within a London context . I don't agree with it's 4 star rating - it's a 3 star in my book.

So when i got up to the desk, i knew in advance there was going to be a problem as i had booked 1 double and you guessed it... one triple. I was told i had only booked a double until i showed them my booking form.

Another recommendation to the hotel is to get a lift installed ion the refurbished part of the hotel..... 6 flights of stairs 4 times a day is no fun for anyone, least of all the maids who have to drag up and down heavy loads of laundry!

When we did arrive, the staff had no idea what to do with us. Getting our room keys and trying to find our luggage turned into a stressful event.

The breakfast offers a large array of cereals, pastries, juices, fruit, eggs, and ham. The downside of breakfast is that the restaurant is located in the basement where too many tables have been crowded into a small space so you have to eat with your elbows attached to your side. Because of the renovations, other problems exist in other parts of the hotel.

Do not be tempted to open the windows as the downpipes for rainwatrer are corroded and leaking and the sound of even light rain cascading down wakes you up.

I was annoyed that I requested an early checkin (as we had an all night flight) and a crib (I even emailed to confirm a week in advance, with no reply). They seemed to have confused our reservation...wanted us to have a double with no crib and wanted us to wait until 2:00 for check in time. I finally spoke up and said that we booked through British Air, booked a Triple with crib and an early checkin. They said that maybe we could get in around 1:00. Our room was a triple...it was neat and clean. The bathroom was large, I thought. Our crib was not waiting for us, we had to ask again for it. The biggest problem I have is that after I made the reservation (months ago), a week before my trip, I received an email from British Air saying that the hotel advised them that there would be some \"slight construction\" but that the workers were instructed to work only during \"regular business hours\" so as not to affect the guests. Listen. The construction is not limited to one area only. They start early in the morning. So you may be asleep at 7 am (that would be 2 AM eastern time!!!!!!!!) and suddenly a chainsaw starts right outside your window. Or you could be relaxing on a Saturday morning and at 7 am, someone hammers on the floor above you. The walls are super thin which I can deal with when it's only talking or tv on the other side of them but demolition is not something I want to hear first thing in the morning. Their construction project is extensive. They really should've shut down until they could finish but I get the feeling they are too cheap to do so. I think they feel they can sucker people in with polite and vague warnings. So stay in the area...it's beautiful~ Stay away from Best Western Paddington Court.", "Date": "March 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cLeft with a sour taste\u201d", "Author": "eudele", "ReviewID": "UR7156451", "Content": "I spent 4 nights here and left feeling the experience could have been better.

We were shown to a room on the second floor - it hadn't been cleaned yet and quite frankly it was disgusting. The wallpaper was dirty in places, the furniture was pulled out of place for some reason (I believe repairs were taking place to a light switch) and the bed was barely made either. I told reception we would not stay in that room and we were instead given a room right at the top of the hotel - to get to it we had to go through a fire door and along a fire exit type of structure. It was a bit tricky to get our luggage along the catwalk part (and I felt that neither of us could get too tipsy in order to get back to our room). It was a tiny room, twin beds wedged in, old fashioned shower close by and a toilet too. It's good that my friend and I get on because we didn't have much choice in the following few days.

At 1$120.00 US a bench in nearby Hyde Park would be an improvement. I have not slept in such a small space since I drank too much wine one night and fell asleep on my bathroom floor. Now the bath....one small bar of soap for 3 days, one plastic drinking glass which unfortunately I tossed and was not replaced. Now the bed....ok, if you like sleeping with a depression in the middle. OK so at least the room was reasonably clean, that is if you immediately remove the bed spread and stuff it under the bed.

We agreed to pay an additional \u00a340 in exchange for an upgrade to a suite and breakfast, which hadn't been included originally. We were anxious at these problems arising before we even arrived but in the end the rest of the trip worked out alright. The upgraded room (across the street from the main hotel and in a basement) was very comfortable and spacious and worth the initial inconvenience. It had a queen sized bed, and decent kitchen area, although the bathroom was somewhat cramped. There was an unpleasant smell in the corridor outside our room which thankfully stayed outside! The breakfast was a served cooked breakfast which suited us but only as we had it included in our upgrade - we wouldn't have been as impressed had we paid the full price for it (there's plenty of cheaper cafes nearby). The staff were very friendly and helpful - the concierge made travel enquiries for us and the rooms which were clean and fresh were serviced daily. The advantage of the suite was that we were able to enjoy the traditional London cuisine (fish and chips!) in the comfort of our room after our late arrival! The location was excellent in a nice area, with restaurants nearby but still quiet and relaxing. The only downside was a good ten minute walk to the nearest underground station and travel to central London could be slow. There were lovely parks to walk through if you had time to enjoy the area instead of hurrying on the tube. Overall our room and the hotel service was fine on this occasion although we wonder if we would have been satisfied with the standard room we had originally booked, as our upgraded room was really what we would expect from a standard room anyway.

They are not open for the posted hours. 7. Daily: no face cloths - they gave us bath mats for the floors! After 1st night, used towels were taken away and no fresh towels provided until we complained. Cheap plastic glasses in the rooms and were not replaced when used. After requesting clean glasses daily, they finally brought 8! Clever, no? 8. Hotel staff is very smiley but do not follow through - probably due to lack of understanding. No one spoke English fluently - making questions pointless. Had to go to the London Elizabeth to have travel/tube/etc. questions answered.

It is when there is an issue that the hotel apparently has difficulty addressing it. My initial room was in the basement, (yuck) but not unacceptable, except that I found (very late at night) that the plug for the bathtub was missing, which made it unable to take a bath. Unfortunately, it was in the hours that maintenance was not in, so I had to make do with a shower after alerting reception, although it wasn't really what I deserved after 12 hours in the plane. I made sure they can follow up on it by also leaving a note in the room as well as at the reception as I left the hotel the next day. However, when I came back in the afternoon, although the room was already made and maintenance must have been in from 7:30am, the plug was still not there and no indication of replacement. I talked to reception, and after some conversation got another room which was much nicer and had a perfectly working bath. They helped me move, so I was almost about to forget about the not-so-nice night before. The next day I was attending a wedding and therefore spent time in the room until 1pm preparing. Housekeeping ladies came and asked when I wanted the room made, so I said \"After 2pm, please.\" They were having some difficulty with English, but pointed at their wristwatch so I pointed at 2pm and they appeared to have understood. Then another man came and asked the same question, so I told him the same thing. His English sounded natural, and I assumed the ladies sent him to confirm my instructions. However, upon returning to my room late at night, I found my room un-made, with a note stuck under the door saying \"did not clean because you instructed us not to disturb.\" Again, it was late at night so I had to make do by getting someone deliver clean towels etc. I made it clear about my displeasure, but there was no follow-up when I checked out the day after and I was past the point of caring anyway, just happy to leave.

What a huge mistake! I would never stay here again for free or even if they paid me! In fact, after seeing our rooms at the Paddington Court, we called our usual hotel in London, willing to pay full price to get out of this place, but at that late date they were already full. So we ended up staying for 2 unhappy nights. It was like staying in a bad youth hostel. The first room my mother got was one of the tiny basement rooms. It was dirty, looked out onto an airshaft, smelled heavily of cigarettes, and had the tiny shower mentioned in previous reviews. It was reached through a narrow dark hallway with rubber pipes/hoses (not sure what they were) dangling overhead out of the ceiling.

The bed linens were of questionable cleanliness, and the walls were absolutely filthy, covered with smudges and stains. There was a bare light bulb hanging over the \"desk\" with no lampshade. The room really was quite hideous. The next day we were given two \"better\" rooms. They were marginally better, but still very dreary, with dirty walls and one of the towels was filthy with a large brown smudge on it! I brought the towel down to reception and was told that the towel would be replaced. It never was. And one of the \"better\" rooms was on the 4th floor (really the 5th floor) and the lift was broken, so we had to walk up and down many flights of stairs.

When I got to my room after a big delay, I discovered there was a problem with the lighting. It flickered on and off and the light in the bathroom did not work at all. Plus, the bed linen had not been changed after the previous guest at all!!! I tried to phone down to reception but got an engaged tone all the time so I had to walk down to them as the lift is broken. They sent the service manager up to investigate. First he told me I could keep fixing the trip switch on the landing and when I told him this was unacceptable, he decided to fix it properly there and then. This took about 20 minutes. I showed him the dirty bed linen, he phoned the hotel manager and told him this was not good enough and then assured me the bed would be changed soon. He also told me that if an inspecter walked in and saw the bed, this place would loose the use of the Best Western name. I spoke to this hotel manager myself before I went out and he agreed to give me \u00a38 off the price of the room on account of the bad service. He too assured me they would change the linen. However, when I returned at ten o'clock that night, the bed had not been touched, it took 3 calls to reception to get someone to come up and he only had one sheet, he went away for ages to get one more and then told me they had no pillowcases for me!!!! All of them were locked up. I believe they tell lies to the guests all the time as nothing makes sense. After he went, I discovered the soap in the bathroom was almost worn away. I have stayed at Best Westerns in London before and was always impressed with the fresh soap each day in its own plastec bag. Next morning, as I checked out, the hotel manager was \"unavailable\". I pressed for more money off the price and after much discussion, I was given \u00a320 off the price for the bad service. I settled for this as they had my credit card and I could not get a better deal. But I am disgusted with such a place and I would never stay there again. They do not care at all about their guests.

I knew that European Hotels were small and upon reading the terrible reviews before I vacationed in London, I braced myself for what was to come. I was not disappointmed. It lived up to its reputation. I checked in with a group of 12 and alot of luggage. The staff in the hotel did not seem prepared for such a big check in. One person in particular was rude and informed us that the hotel had booked us all in smoking rooms (we had requested non smoking). The staff proceeded to swipe our charge cards to charge us for the rooms which had already been prepaid through our travel agent. We insisted on non smoking rooms and were told to give the staff a few minutes to find the rooms for us. We were told that we were getting the larger rooms because of the original error in booking smoking rooms. My boyfriend and I were put in a basement room. How we found the room and were able to find our way out everyday is surprising. The hotel is a maze of small hallways with multiple doors closing off the hallways. The lift, on top of that, was broken during our stay so we had to lug our luggage to and from the basement. Upon getting into the room we found the room to be small. It was very dark and smelled musty. The bedspreads and window treatments were also a very dark navy blue which did not help to brighten up the room. Our window was open to the outside and was at waist level where anyone could break in. We closed it and tried to turn on the air conditioning. It didn't work. We went upstairs to check with the staff and was told that the air conditioning did not work and to just keep our window open because no one would break in. The bathrooms were very small. The worst part of the bathroom was the shower which was literally 2x2. Everynight when taking a shower, I was assaulted by the shower curtain which clung to my body. There was no way to get away from it because the shower was so small. Water flooded the outside bathroom floor everynight. Since the shower curtain was so long, I learned the first night that it floated over the drain of the shower and caused the shower to fill up and overflow. If it was put on the outside of the shower the floor got wet. Being very conscientious of cleanliness, I wondered how many bodies this shower curtain had clung to before clinging to me everynight. I found the thought disgusting. I next noticed that there were two PVC pipes snaking along the wall and draining into the shower. I realized that one of the pipes was attached to the backside of the air conditioner and had the the air conditioner been working, I think would have drained condensation into the shower. The other PVC pipe came from the other side and originated from the tank of the toilet and drained out into the shower. I wondered how this could pass anytype of sanitary inspection. The bed was okay in terms of comfort, but when I initially pulled back the sheets I found hair (not ours as we had just checked in) on the sheets. I also found that the sheets were not changed the whole time that I was there and maybe this is customary to save on expense. I knew they were not changed because the same brown spot that was on my sheet remained there for the duration of my stay. The internet television service did not work and every night, usually after 11:30 p.m. a group of people staying on our floor would talk noisely in the hallways and slam doors. Our neighbors could be heard carrying on a very clear conversation. I usually don't write letters or reviews like this as I am easy to please but I felt that my experience was bad enough that anyone choosing to stay here needed to know what they could expect. I understand that the rates are affordable and I can deal with small, but cleanliness and good customer service are important. Please don't get me wrong, not all the staff was rude, in fact I really only experienced the initial check in person to be short with us. He seemed to change his attitude after another hotel representative (I think he may have been management) reassurred us that the room situation would be worked out and thanked us for our patience. Then out of nowhere a number of employees came out to assist with our bags.

From the first day, i already have bad impression on this hotel, since the lift doesn't work at all, and everyone have to take the stairs to go to their rooms, luckily my room was not that far away, but the hallway to the room is narrow and confusing to find a way. The room, itself, is very small and the bathroom eventhough it's quite clean, it is also small. The bad impression leads to bad experience on the second day of my stay. After a long day of work training and sightseeings, i went back to the hotel room and found out that my key didn't work!!! I went to the reception and told one of the receptionist that it didnt work. She put my card into the card reader, reprogram it and gave it back to me to try it again. So I did, up the stairs, around the hallways, went back in front of my room, just to find out that the key still didnt work. I went to the reception again, and this time with different receptionist, and he did the same thing as the previous receptionist did, and gave me back the key and i did the same process again. Until the third time i went back, the receptionist came to the room, brought something to program the door key but it still didnt work until 5 minutes later. I was really tired and weary at this point, and when finally the door was open, the guy said to me to report the problem to the reception the morning after and have them to reprogram the door so i wouldnt have this problem again. WHAT??? Shouldn't he, the one who report to his collegue in the morning to fix the problem?? I'm already tired and can't argue anymore, so i just went inside the room and sleep on this lousy spring bed. Before I stayed in this hotel, i stayed for one night in premier travell inn county hall. I have totatlly different experience. With almost the same price, travell inn definitely have more spacious room, clean beds, linens and bathrooms, and also helpful staff.

We checked in and were told(not taken) where are rooms were. The lift was far too small, there was only two of us with a small amount of luggage each and we only just managed to get into the lift, call me fussy but I find it rather frustrating having to struggle just to get into a lift. As went got into our room it just looked very used and tired, although it was fairly clean. The bathroom was smelt of... well you can imagine, which was poorly disguised with bleach. The beds were very uncomfortable and the bedspreads and curtains were very tasteless. We were only given a few sheets which were rough and itchy. After getting settled into the room we went sight seeing. When leaving the hotel via the awful lift we ended up on the basement level where we got a little confused and were rudely asked \"Can we help you!?\" and were told this was not the exit and to use the stairs. When we got back to the hotel we went straight to out room then didn't have a very good nights sleep. The next morning we went down to breakfast. The dining room and staff again were well presented. The breakfast itself however was AWFUL. I had a bowel of cereal and a croissant and my friend had an English breakfast. Both our meals were very tasteless. The milk was off so we had to ask for a fresh jug of milk. The coffee was weak and tasted like it had been sat out all morning. Overall the breakfast was the worst I had ever eaten. Again that day we went out sightseeing. When we got back to the hotel room I discovered my towel was missing, it had been mistaken for one of their own towels. Although it was white just like thiers, it was far better qaulity than the ones they had provided. I phoned the reception asking where it would have gone. Because of a laungauge barrier he only just understood what I was saying and said they would call back, no one did. The next day we checked out and I had to enquire about my towel again. They took my address and said they would mail it to me, you may think this is a bit silly just for a towel but it was an expensive one and I don't see why I should have to buy another one because of someone else being incompetent and not realizing that its a different style.

I paid approx \u00a345 per night. This didnt include breakfast so I cant comment on their restaurant. I found both the room and its ensuite to be on the small and cramped side but for the price for this hotel in Central London , I cant complain. However what disappointed me and what I found to be inexcusable for a 3 star was the fact that the carpet in the room looked very old and dirty (i.e rotten!) and the wall that the side of the bed was against was gruby. It much needed a coat of white paint, instead i had a gruby off white wall with black marks and stains on it. The general standard of the furnishing and lighting in the room was above average and it came with the standard colour tv with remote. coffee/tea kettle and telephone. Also a trouser press, hair dryer, alarm clock and Internet point (which I didnt use). The small ensuite bathroom was furnished well but the shower hose and head was a toy. Room cleaned and new towels punctual during my stay. The quiet-ish area that the hotel is in has wide roads around it and I wouldnt bet on \"dead silence\" not untill after midnight. Also Im fairly certain I heard the rumblings of the underground trains directly below! personally thou this didnt bother me and I found the general noise levels at night to be acceptable, also my room was on the ground floor which I would beleive to be the least quiet. Hotel staff seemed very ready to help and friendly. Also they were well presented and smart in appearance. The highly polished floors and corridors of the ground floors look great, its a shame that things like blankets on the floor (just outside my door) and dirty plates on a dining tray seemed to be left around the corridor all day, presumably awaiting the next shift. The reason why I chose this hotel is beacuse Ive had reason to stay in the area before and having walked passed I noticed its very impressive looking entrance and reception area. I now believe this to be a \"honey trap\" of sorts as the standard of the room I stayed in did not reflect the standard of the reception and entrance area. I would possibly stay in this hotel again because of its cheap rates and convenient location, especially for Paddington Station which is about 8 minutes walk away. Id also like to point out at this stage that some older people may find the walk to Lancaster Gate tube a bit of a drag, especially if they are doing it twice plus daily.

The comments and reviews about this hotel are very true, and mostly they are bad. Take heed... there are many other choices in London that are not that much more expensive and you will be very sorry if you waste your money, however little of it, on this hotel. It would be like just throwing money out on the sidewalk to doss down with the bums in the street. Ok, so maybe not that bad...but Best Western really ought to look at this hotel and considering pulling its franchise. Don't let this bad hotel put you off of Best Western entirely, I stayed at a perfectly nice Best Western in Paris. Here was what happened to us -- we arrived early in the day and waited in a long line to check in. Their staff is all Indian and we could hardly understand a word they said...and their systems seem to be mostly manual. I didn't expect the rooms to be ready, and they weren't but the hotel did offer to store the luggage in a secure room. So far so good...except for the garbled language problems. Then when we came back after dinner for our room we collected our bags -- we had to get them *by ourselves* out of the little room -- and went up to our rooms. On first glance they weren't too bad. We had two twin rooms and they put us at least on the same floor. When I sat down on the bed I almost went down to the floor! The mattress was up against the wall, so the side of the bed to sit on was completely sprung. When I say that the springs were sticking up, it's an understatement. There was absolutely no padding on the mattress and it seemed as if I was just sleeping straight on the springs. It was late, I was tired...so I toughed it out for the night. The bathroom -- ha ha ha. The shower -- ha ha ha. The next day we asked if the bed could be changed, but they made us change rooms. This couldn't be done immediately, fair enough, but I had to come back to the room to change clothes after lunch and they didn't have my luggage moved so I had to do that myself. The new room...no better. The bed was extremely bad and uncomfortable. I didn't get any sleep at all. The neighborhood, by the way, is very nice. Paddington is close by and there are other tube stops nearby. Hyde Park is just down the street and if you like to walk you can include Hyde Park in your stroll. There are some excellent pubs and restaurants and a couple of internet cafes nearby too. Breakfast: Don't bother with the hotel breakfast. If you can book room only it's worth it to find breakfast elsewhere. Theirs is rubbish. Bottom line...don't stay at this hotel. If you must, ask to see the room first, and try the bed, before you commit to a room. If the first one they give you isn't any good then leave yourself some time to find another or get another hotel. There are hundreds in this neighborhood.

For most people taking overnight flights, the hotel will store your luggage for free until your room is ready. I had a double bed in the newer section. There is no lift service to the newer section and I was on the third floor; great for exercise, but if stairs are an issue, this could be a problem (the older section has a lift). The room wasn't as small as I feared from reading about London hotel room sizes. KEEP IN MIND if you see the pictures of this place on expedia or other web sites, the rooms shown are for the upscale studios, not the standard rooms! The room is fine though, comfortable and clean, and includes tea maker, full wardrobe with shelving, nightstand with 3 empty drawers, and iron and ironing board. The two windows near the bed opened up fully onto the nice residential street, which was a great way to start the morning with fresh air. The bathroom was awesome; very large (as big as the bedroom almost), very clean, with a high tub and shower. Only complaint was there was VERY LITTLE water pressure, but the water was very hot, so I got used to it. The towels were awesome; big and fluffy--felt good after the shower. The Front Desk staff, while very professional, were not very responsive; requests for extra pillows, etc. were forgotten. Walk to Paddington station in only 10 minutes, or walk to Lancaster Gate 10 minutes. This hotel is short walk to Kensington Park and Hyde Park (near Lancaster Gate Tube). Nice quiet-enough street. There's 2 convenient-stores right across the street, plenty of pubs and souvenir shops, and a GREAT DELI across the street next to the medical office and NISA store that has high speed internet for only 1 GBP for an hour's time. The food is outstanding, the staff friendly, the deli is small but you can sit outside at the tables or inside. The hotel offers free internet in all rooms VIA THE TV--it SUCKED. The graphics are not the same as via the web, there is no back feature, it was time consuming and frustrating, so don't rely on this as a benefit; I would just go across the street to the deli and use the internet there, or there are plenty of internet cafes all over London. The breakfast buffet is very good, but b/c of my low rate, wasn't included; it was 6.95 GBP, unlimited English breakfast delicious. The cocktail bar is small but nice and the the common lounge next to reception is very spacious and comfortable, great for reading or watching TV.

We arrived, tired, at the end of a long trip, looking forward to a good sleep before our flight home. This wasn't to be. The first man in line as we arrived was berating the frazzled desk clerk about his accomodations and was wanting an immediate room change, which couldn't be accomodated. Next up were two businessmen, who were told there was a problem with their rooms and they would need to be put up in another hotel. After a lengthy, heated exchange, they stormed out of the hotel, cancelling their 'reservation'. Next up, we were also told that there was a room problem, but they were going to put us up in an upgraded, four star hotel and they would pay for the taxi over. Sounded good. However, we waited much longer than an hour for the ride. Turns out they couldn't just use a taxi service, it had to be a company they have an arrangement with, so we waited, waited, waited, with the clerk intermittently phoning them, pleading with them to come as the list of unhappy travellers continued to grow. When we finally arrived at the hotel, well after midnight, we were horrified. The 'four star hotel' we had been promised was under major renovation and in the dark all that could be seen was scaffolding. Our sound sleep was not to be. There was no air conditioning and the room was stifling. The window wouldn't budge more than an inch. The front desk person came up and fought with the window and also couldn't get it to open. His solution: open the door to the hallway to let cool air in. By then it's about 1 a.m., so that wasn't a particularly viable option. And sure enough, in the morning, construction started up, so there was no quiet and no privacy as construction people walked right by the window. The only good thing about our experience was the camaraderie developed with other exhausted people who were waiting with us, caught in the same predicament. An Irish couple dubbed our '4 star hotel' Fawlty Towers, which had us hooting. You'll see why, when you see the attached picture of our \"4 star upgrade\".", "Date": "July 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cbooked here but transferred to another hotel\u201d", "Author": "bigspender1971", "ReviewID": "UR3679442", "Content": "I booked this hotel before reading the reviews.

Save yourself the trouble...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1768785", "Content": "I initially booked a room at this hotel because I thought its location would be ideal since it is in close proximity to the Paddington tube station, and in fact that turned out to be the only positive outcome from my stay there. The hotel appears lovely from outside and the lobby is quite nice, too, but on the first night there I was waiting to check in and I received an omen that I was about to experience an awful stay. A couple there was complaining about how they had requested coffee 48 hours ago and they had called several times to remind the concierge but no one did anything about it. It was obvious that they were upset and the concierge really did nothing to help them out, it seemed he couldn't care less. He wouldn't answer them when they asked for the manager's name, nor would he give them a contact number. The couple was enraged and they left fuming. I thought at first that maybe it was just them but then that same night I discovered that we didn't have a blowdryer so I went to the front desk to request one and the concierge there said there wasn't one available because all the rooms were booked at the moment and he would need to wait until someone had left the next morning so that I could have one then. I found that hard to believe but went along with it. So I called the next morning around 6:30 and asked for the blowdryer. I was told then that they would deliver one to my room in 15 minutes. Half an hour passed by and there was still no sign of the blowdryer so I called again and this time another person answered and he told me that it's \"in the drawer\"...I asked which drawer, and he continued to be vague so I just hung up. It turns out that it was in the dresser drawer right beneath the TV (which by the way didn't even work properly) but I couldn't understand why I wasn't told that the other night when I initially asked for it. Anyway, we had this other problem with the staff there. Besides the fact that most of them 1) were rude and disrespectful and 2) were totally incompetent, it seems that they actually went out of their way to make our stay difficult. We needed a room for one extra night since we were spending part of our vacation in Paris and we were told that we wouldn't have a problem getting a room. The next day, however, when we tried to book something, this other receptionist, a short Indian woman whose name I couldn't catch, told us that we were mistaken, there was nothing available for the night we requested. Obviously we were furious because not only were we given the wrong information the previous night but she did absolutely NOTHING to help us, and her sour expression showed no sign of empathy at all for our situation. We decided to speak to someone else the next day and the assistant manager, Roy, handled the matter but he did put on a very arrogant and snooty attitude. He didn't give us any confirmation of a room but merely signed a letter saying that something was available and that was all. So we came back from Paris and apparently there was a mix-up because they couldn't find anything booked under the cardholder's name (my friend's, who was staying with me) and they told us that they were fully booked for that night so we couldn't stay there. Fortunately, we were able to get assistance from the manager there who was really a blessing. If it weren't for him we would have been left with no place to stay our last night in London. Not only was he corteous and kind but he also went out of his way to do what he could for us. It turned out that the room was booked under my name although it would have saved us a lot of time and trouble if Roy had told us that to begin with, but anyway, we got to stay at this 4 star hotel instead of at Paddington for the same rate that was promised to us, so in that sense we lucked out. Even our transportation to the other hotel was provided for us thanks to the manager (I can't remember his name because I lost the business card but I think it was something like Peader; he had a slim build, average height, and red hair). Really, I can't fully express just how terrible the service was at this hotel and the manager was the only person who stood out as someone who cared about the customers. If you can settle with bad service then stay there because it is in a good location but I would rather stay somewhere else that has a nice and friendly staff. I'll admit that the rooms were decent but still small, and the TV gave us problems (it wouldn't turn on at times). Overall, I would have to say that it's really not worth it to stay at this hotel because it will ruin your trip by making you disgruntled twoards Londoners thanks to the poor service and attitude at the BWPCH.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cIf you love to sleep with bugs and bad service...\u201d", "Author": "berfah", "ReviewID": "UR1756864", "Content": "Deceptive. Upon arrival to the Paddington Best Western, the lobby looked clean and quaint. The staff was curt and uninviting (but that could just be Londoners).

Meanwhile, our bathroom had a sign up that said, \"DO NOT USE\" and we were worried that there was a problem so we called management and they said not to worry about it. Any reasonable person would take the sign down if there wasn't any problems. We were reluctant to use it, but ended up conceeding. Then I went in search of a hairdryer. This is where the problem escalated. We didn't find one in the room so called the concierge again and noted that to them. They said it was in our drawers, but we mentioned that we couldn't find it. So I went to bed with a wet head. Then in the morning before we left for the day we AGAIN notified them that we did not have a hairdryer and AGAIN they said it was in our drawers and we said it was not in there.
