Luckily I had put their number in my cell phone before we left home because our luggage pick up got moved to terminal 6 to one of the baggage claim areas where we had to walk about 3 minutes outside to get there. Upon arriving there I didn't see the courtesy phones that the hotel told me to use to call them. The hotel itself was very basic, about what you would expect from a Super 8. The room was very basic, but clean and looked as if it had been recently painted. We were so tired we didn't hear any planes, but we also got up early to get started on our vacation. The breakfast was very skimpy, a few cereals and breads and pastries. No fresh fruit or yogurt , but what really bothered me was the pitcher they kept refilling with milk looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks and the lady working at the desk was not at all friendly. The plus side of this budget motel is the fact that it is right across the street from Avis Car Rental and a few blocks from Budget, which happens to be across the street from the Marriott Renaissance. We had rented from Budget and so after breakfast we just walked ( about 5 minutes) to the Budget lot, rented our car and drove back to the Super 8 and check out and were on our way!

I expected this being a airport hotel, but just wanted to warn anybody else that had a night flight like me, do no expect any sleep outside of midnight to 6am. They fly that late and start that early. The bed was clean, I found check in to be very friendly. The Greek restaurant that is next door was very friendly but the food was not that good, and it was over priced. Check out was fast, but not very friendly. I had no issues with the shuttle picking me up at noon or driving me back at 9pm. Both drivers were friendly. Internet is free but very slow.

During this wait we saw shuttles for other hotels go by numerous times. The shuttle for the Renaissance/Crown Plaza (mentioned later) went by at least three times.

We broke up the trip with an overnight in LA before embarking on the long flight. I was glad we stayed here, as this met all our needs. With AAA booking directly on their site is a great value.

Internet worked really well and was free. Breakfast was standard Super 8, basic cereals and muffins with beverages. Seating area was open all the time as it's part of the check-in area. This was great for us, as I have food sensitivities. This allowed me to fix my own dinner/lunch with the microwave. The rest of the family ordered food from a restaurant that delivered, which was very convenient. We made use of their coin laundry. We enjoyed the courtyard/parking lot area which felt very safe and allowed our kids to run off some steam. At the airport, the station where you are supposed to be able to call the hotels for shuttle service was out of order (this is not the hotel's fault). We had Super 8's phone number, so we called with our cell phone. It should be noted that a phone call needs to be placed in order to get the shuttle service. We waited about 15 minutes after placing our call, and the shuttle had plenty of room for our massive amount of luggage. Returned to airport the next day by shuttle that left on the hour. The drivers were very helpful and friendly and helped us with all the bags. Shuttles are free + tip for driver's help with luggage. Only potential drawback is that if you are a sensitive sleeper, the planes are pretty loud. We were exhausted so it didn't bother us a bit. We couldn't hear anything from the neighboring rooms or outside, other than the planes. Perhaps ear plugs would do the trick. :) Also, at one time hot water ran out fairly quickly.

I was able to find a highly discounted rate on priceline for $52.00 per night, which was excellent considering it was a weekend. As the Super 8 is a value chain, of course one can't go there expecting the Ritz-Carlton! With that being said, the staff were great from start to finish, very nice people. Before even completing my request for a cab company number, they were on the phone calling for me. Great customer service! This location has a free shuttle service to and from LAX. They can be contacted at any of the courtesy phone touch-screen kiosks that are located in just about every baggage claim area. You are patched directly to the front desk, they'll waste no time answering, will tell you exactly where to wait, and the shuttle will arrive quickly. On this particular visit, I stayed in room 230, and everything was in excellent shape. The only thing I noticed was that the king bed was actually two twins that were pushed together, but I didn't realize this until it was time to check out so obviously didn't have any issues. The room was located overlooking the courtyard, which was a lot quieter that the room on the parking lot side I had on my last visit. Free wifi is always a big plus, and the Greek restaurant at the rear of the property is awesome - Aliki's Greek Taverna. The property has a pool, free coffee/tea, and complimentary cereals and toast, although I didn't utilize any of these amenities. The ice machine in the parking lot was in great working order and could only be turned on by inserting a room key. As some other reviewers have mentioned, yes, airplane noise will be heard. I've talked to lots of friends that have stayed in just about every hotel in the LAX airport area, as far as 8 miles down the road from the terminals, and this is not a problem that's unique with just the Super 8, you'll get it anywhere. If noise is an issue, book miles away from the airport. I was having a hard time finding locations of nearby stores and restaurants within walking distance before my trip, and this area is generally nothing but hotels and rental car agencies, so here's what's around: Burger King is on Airport Blvd. about a block and a half away, on the opposite side of the road. It's visible from the front of the property. 7 Eleven is up the road in the other direction, on the corner of Airport Blvd. and Manchester Ave. Walking down Westchester will take you directly into an area of Sepulveda Blvd. which has In N Out Burger, Ralph's Supermarket, Boston Market, Pizza Hut, and many others.

The free breakfast was simple but adequate with cereals, pastries, juices, milk and coffee. There was a coffee maker and hair dryer in the room. I live in rural Ohio and did not feel the area was unsafe in anyway. Our car rental company was a block away and my friend and I (2 middle-aged women) felt comfortable walking back in the late evening to our room from dropping our car off. The hotel had free 24 hour airport transportation. There was one Greek restaurant in the same block of the hotel (that we did not try). Otherwise, there were no other eateries we noticed within walking distance. We did not notice the airplane noise at night but we ran the fan which may have muffled the sounds. There was an outside pool that we did not have time to enjoy but it looked clean. If I ever have to travel to LA again and fly into LAX, I will probably stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northwood, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cIt's a Super 8\u201d", "Author": "Mr_Roamer", "ReviewID": "UR27258456", "Content": "I'll admit: it's been some time since I've stayed here. The memory is still quite fresh. I was looking for a cheap place to stay on a California trip. This place was definitely cheap. I tried to do my own routing to this hotel because I thought I saw a short cut on the map; I was wrong. As a result, I got a real nice tour of the area--which was something I would have been perfectly happy skipping. I did not feel very safe in the area and that feeling was only enhanced when I got to the hotel's front desk. At the time, there was a glass partition between the lobby customers and desk clerk. Nothing instills confidence quite like that, right? The partition seems to be gone in the hotel's photos. Checkin went without incident. I was dreading going to the room, but found the room to be nice compared to other Super 8's in which I've stayed. I didn't have any negative experiences with bed bugs, ants, etc. that I saw in the notes that other reviewers posted. The room seemed to be fine/clean. I did notice the noise from the air traffic, but it seemed to stop by bedtime. Not sure if it actually did, but I didn't hear any air traffic overnight. My room's bathroom was the biggest I've ever seen at any hotel, and it too was clean. Parking was free, but the lot seemed very small. I felt that the drive through the parking lot was a bit too narrow. I wound up backing into the space closest to the exit so that I wouldn't have to navigate out in the morning.
