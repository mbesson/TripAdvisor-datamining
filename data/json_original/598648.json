{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I'll sum it up in one word. The hotel STINKS It was rated a 3-star hotel, but in reality it should NOT even be rated at all. It was dirty, noisy, smelly, in short, the hotel STINKS. I had immediately requested from our travel agent to be transferred to another hotel, but found out that if we didn't stay for even a single night, we have to pay the penalty. Tried to sleep the first night, but can't due to the smell, and stayed awake till the morning we were transferred to a real four-star international hotel, The toilet is miserable. The first room where we were brought to had a faulty toilet bowl, was transferred to another room, but it is even worse. The third room where we finally got in isn't better but its the lesser of evils. The breakfast ?? What breakfast??? Only the really hungry people can eat it. I didn't even dare taste it. I do not recommend this hotel to any traveller, especially to those from the West and the moneyed people. That was the worst nightmare of my travelling life. It spoiled my trip to the ancient China. Had it not been for that experience, the trip is worth everything I spent.", "Date": "May 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR546969899", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Ed_from_Riyadh"}, {"Content": "One Month in China, This Was the Worst Hotel experience.
