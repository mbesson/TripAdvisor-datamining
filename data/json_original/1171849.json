We checked a couple others by looking at the rooms and were very disappointed. As we pulled into this one I really did not get my hopes up, but much to my surprise it was Fantastic. It was an older motel, that was very clean, smelled very clean, and the over all stay was absolutely FANTASTIC. The owners were great, very sweet and honest. I would very much advise others to stay here and the next time I am in Branson, MO this is the first place I will go to get a room. The price was very reasonable and it had all the nice amenities.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cI wouldn't recommend this motel to my worst enemy\u201d", "Author": "913familyof5", "ReviewID": "UR134273322", "Content": "My family and I were looking for a cheap place to stay for two nights while visiting branson. The first night we stayed they offered veggies from the garden and they insisted if we wanted to swim all night we could and was very nice. We have 5 children and wanted to go to Silver Dollar City the next day so we did just that. We came back from the park and grilled out some food with our family and 2 of our family members that lives in branson and the Brian came out and wanted to know who's car was parked in the space I expained it was my nephew and he said that's ok. 20 minutes later his wife comes out and says he has to leave. They don't allow visitors. I explained that he was my nephew and he would be leaving soon. After he left about an hour later the cops showed up and said we had to leave the property. This was at 1230-1am in the morning. I had 5 children sleeping...So we had to wake them up and go find another hotel and then they charged me additonal 120.00 on my credit card. So If I was you I would find a different place to stay. Anyone that would do that to a family with 5 kids has absolutely no heart or class. To top it off, the pool had cracks in the concrete and a gigantic hole on one side.

After looking online for motel rooms, we decided on the Homestead Motel, based on pricing and the reviews that we read. To say the least, we were not disappointed with our stay. The owners were very helpful and friendly. The motel was located close to the strip so it was easy to get in and out so that the \"wife\" could shop. The only thing that could have been better is a taller shower head. (I am 6' 4\" tall).

What we found was the Homestead Motel, which is anything but \"cheap!\" VERY GOOD VALUE, but never cheap! The owners and their children work diligently to make your stay perfect. It is absolutely the cleanest place I have ever stayed, including some very high-end establishments. We have now stayed there twice and recommended it to several people. My parents have also stayed there on our recommendation and just called me to look up the phone number because they are going to Branson this summer and want to stay there again. I LOVE the sign out front, that is the original reason we stopped there.

Having a guided tour through Missourri and Arkansas by Brian made the experience one I will not soon forget. Brian quickly led us away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and onto some of the best roads in the country. Soon after meeting Brian you know he is passionate about riding and with every passing mile you understand why. There are too many details to write here; the hidden treasures of local eateries was a great way to fuel-up during the rides. And after a great day of riding Brian escorted me to a great place to eat (and we avoided most of the out-of-town traffic) and a show on the strip.
