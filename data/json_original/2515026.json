We never got to use it ourselves, but make sure you reserve space early--at peak times, it does fill up fast! Our room was a nice king bed (very cozy!) in room 938 (for all you baseball fans, this has a great view of Safeco Field where the Seattle Mariners play.) The rooms looks like they have been updated with marble counter tops in the bathroom and wet bar area. It was surprising to have a wet bar in the room, but it was very nice. There was the standard coffee maker but also a microwave and mini fridge which is great if you want to re-heat leftovers from a meal you couldn't finish or keep some drinks cold. Please note that there are ice machines on every floor EXCEPT the 9th, so we had to go down 1 floor to get ice. This was a non issue. Just down the hall is the rooftop pool and hot tub (which we didn't use because it was November.)

There were no Mariners, Seahawks or Sounders games going on so the place was quiet and I was allowed to check in right away as I arrived pretty early. The restaurant in the lobby was decent -- but a little lacking in charm, maybe because it was empty. But, yeah, overall this hotel is nice. Definitely worth the $100 or so a night that I paid on Priceline. The only drawback about this place is its location -- that's why I rate it 3 instead of 4. Other than the lobby restaurant and Pyramid brew pub across the street, you're in nowheresville. Super useful, I imagine, if you're in town for one day just to see a game.

I got the hotel through Hotwire when I had the area, Pike Place Market selected. Its a 20min walk so its no where in that area. They do have a shuttle bus that goes there. The shuttle bus leaves every 30 mins and it was actually pretty handy if you're doing the normal tourist thing. Rooms where nice, the the roof top hot tub was cool. The pool was small and is less than 4 feet deep and was always full of children splashing around. Even though its on the outskirts of downtown, the shuttle buses make up for its distance.

Unfortunately, I found management lacking during the crisis and they made no effort to make guests comfortable while power was off and restaurant closed. Staff was huddled around the gas fireplace in the lobby and the only guest offer made was to show them where to walk up the stairs to enter room. Since the outage occurred from 11-1:30pm - the most frequent question was \"where can i go to get something to eat?\" I sat in the lobby for over an hour and it would have been a nice touch for the hotel to have offered hot beverages or a snack in the lobby. At around 5pm when i returned, my room on the 6th floor had no heat. Engineering was called and they responded promptly by resetting a HVAC button in the closet. Traffic noise, sirens were loud and my husband wore ear plugs to sleep. There is some sort of clean air window in the room but the clips were broken off so it was not soundproof.

I took the train in and after finding my bearings, I realized that this hotel was only a 15 min walk from the Amtrak station which was very convenient, especially for a budget traveler like myself who hates paying for cabs. When I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the lovely lobby and welcoming front desk attendant. I checked in a little earlier than the check in time but my room was ready which was great. My room was quite spacious! It had 2 extremely comfortable queen beds (with some of the most comfy pillows!), 42 in flat screen TV, mini fridge, microwave, plenty of drawers, and a nice bathroom with a sunken bathtub! I was also pleased with the rooftop heated pool and hot tub that overlooks Seattle. One of the challenges of this hotel is that while it is downtown adjacent, the area may be a little sketchy to walk in at night. However the hotel remedies this by providing FREE shuttle service to any of the nearby tourist spots. The shuttle is available 7am - 11pm every 30 min from the lobby! They will also pick you up from nearby tourist spots which is so wonderful. The shuttle drivers were very nice and offered a lot of good advice for visitors. **Hint** Just give them a few bucks tip as a courtesy (they deserve is dealing with that crazy Seattle traffic). For those who prefer to walk, Pioneer Square is about 1 mile from the hotel. If you are in town for a game, great news, Safeco Field is literally right across the street from the hotel! This hotel also offers room service from the restaurant downstairs. I ordered room service and it wasn't too shabby. Although, I was not too happy to pay a delivery fee plus an 18% gratuity to make a 2 min elevator ride. So the next time, I just walked downstairs and picked up my own meal to go from the restaurant to cut out the middle man. There are many wonderful restaurants within a mile or so as well if you wish to venture out. Overall, I was very pleased with the value I received for the price (I booked on Hotwire). The hotel is clean, pleasant, safe, and comfortable. Any issues with the location is taken care of with the shuttle service. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, convenient, weekend getaway, especially if you take the train in.

I forgot to write the review until I needed to look up hotels for our next trip! :) We flew in to Seattle to attend a Seahawks VS Giants game, and wanted the proximity to the stadium, since we hadn't been to Seattle before. What we actually got was a WHOLE lot more! Yes, it is literally right next to both the Seahawks stadium AND the Mariners stadium, but its really a short walk to anything, though if you dont feel like walking, they have a FREE SHUTTLE! I spoke to Chris to book my reservation, and he was BEYOND friendly and helpful, and made me feel very comfortable about the hotel and area in which it is located. He suggested restaurants and things to do, and boasted on their shuttle service, which has service pickup/drop-off points, though if they are not busy when you call, they may be able to pick up/drop you somewhere specific. The rooms are great! We originally booked just a normal king room, on the 9th floor, which was perfect, great size, and CLEAN! :) (see pics) Our TV, however, kept turning itself on and off...hmmm... so they moved us to a fantastic SUITE (!) on the same floor. This particular suite had windows that allowed a view of both stadiums, and the street below. On game day, we LOVED this! You could feel the excitement coming up from the street. :) The beds (in both rooms, actually) were comfortable, not too hard, not too soft. Great pillows. iPod docking alarm clock radio. Seattle's Best coffee with a coffee maker, flat screen TV's (in the suite, there were 2) a mini-fridge, and a GREAT SHOWER! Big, adjustable shower head with excellent flow. Hair dryer, great toiletries (no need to bring your own!) and soft towels. (see more pics! :) We did hear our neighbors on one night, but only for a little while and the rest of our stay was really quiet. Rooms are clean, still in new condition. I really loved this hotel!!! There is a pool and spa on the 9th floor. We did use the spa, but not the pool. The spa was big, with great jets, and it was HOT! Perfect for after a flight in! There is a restaurant (Jimmy's On First) on the main floor, but we are impatient folk and didnt want to wait (it was PACKED ever morning), so we walked a few blocks in to Starbucks. (What?! Its SEATTLE! LOL!!!) However, if you walk out the main lobby door and turn right, there is a little walk-up window cafe right there on the street, about half a block up. Muffins, coffee, etc. The first time we left the hotel on foot, we followed the route along the water, suggested by the reception desk clerk. We love to walk new cities; there is no better way to see ALLLL of it. This was not a bad route, if you want to see the more industrial side of Seattle/freeway/backs of beautiful buildings. We suggest, however, walking out the doors, turning toward Seahawks stadium and walking into the city that way. You get lots of storefronts and interesting things to see. Seattle is just gorgeous! We used the shuttle service several times. They prefer you use their appointment system to use the shuttle, but you forget (as we did) they are very flexible with it. When it took us to the Space Needle/Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Museum one morning, we noticed a McDonalds kitty-corner from us and had breakfast there. There is a magazine in the room, with restaurant suggestions, and we took them. LOL! We tried il Forniao, an Italian restaurant downtown at the mall, which the shuttle was kind enough to drop us at. Another night we tried Elliots, on the pier. YUMMMMMMM! Both were fantastic, reasonably priced, and had GREAT service. We recommend both. On last note, I was unaware the Seattle had LOTS of breweries. LOL! Incidentally, there is even one located kitty-corner from the hotels lobby, Pyramid Alehouse, though we never went in. We were told they had great food, as well as brews. Anyway, we booked a brewery tour, through Great Pacific Northwest Brewery Tours. SOOOO FUN!!! I recommend that as well. They take you to 3 breweries, and you get to try several beers at each. Be aware, they are NOT sample size! :) Bottom line, we LOVED Seattle, and LOVED Silver Cloud Hotel-Stadium.

The Stadium property is aptly named, since it is the only hotel located between Safeco and Quest Fields in Seattle and is perhaps a 4 1/2 rating, if that were available. How it came to be located there would be an interesting story- but it does enjoy the perfect definition of \"Location, Location, Location\". The location of the two stadiums, and the hotel, brings the love/hate relationship to bear. They are all located in the rail yards and industrial area south of the Seattle downtown core; and there is industrial and train traffic in the vicinity. So if that bothers you don't stay there- there are thousands of rooms 10 minutes north in downtown. But if you want to be within a few steps of the two fields, this is THE ( actually the only) place to stay. On the plus side: The property is fairly new and has been well maintained. The staff, from valet to front desk to housekeeping to the restaurant and bar was top notch- great attitudes and very good skills. The property is a full service business location in addition to supporting the sports venues. The rooms are large and fully equipped: large plasma TV with every sports station imaginable, refer, micro, complementary internet, wet bar with good coffee, morning newspaper, large bath with lots of counter space and good toiletries. The bed was better than average with good linens. While the rooms are not soundproof, they are good enough considering the cacophony present outside. We ate and beveraged at Jimmy's, the hotel restaurant and bar- service was excellent, food and beverage above average. This is a very good house so the improvement list is relatively short. The hotel has only two public elevators for a nine story building; there are regular lines to use them. And when an event lets out the lines get very long. But this would be a tough fix on a completed building. And the bath towels should be better for a property of this caliber and price. We rated the value down a notch, but they may be debatable. At a minimum of $250 per night and $20 per day for parking that adds a lot to the price of a Mariner, Seahawk or Sounder game. The restaurant prices were stiff but again not out of line for downtown. Keep in mind that Seattle adds plenty of sales/ excise taxes to each of these - 10% for food, 15% for hotels and 19% for parking- so the tariff for a couple of day stay is not insignificant.

You can easily walk to Pioneer Square (5mins) and downtown (10-15mins) despite what other fat and lazy reviews have said on here...and it is a lovely walk along the waterfront or historical 1st Ave. Also, as a sports fan it was really cool to see the entrance to shiny, new Safeco Field directly outside the hotel. I can't see noise being an issue from the ballpark unless you were on the south side of the hotel...but even then, the games are finished by 10pm at the latest.

With Ipod docks and flat screen HDTVs they are on the cutting edge and the suite with the hot tub cannot be beat after a long day walking the city streets and getting ready for the night game.

This year I did less on the town tourist wise but the shuttle will get you around downtown with no problem and the after hours the cabs are just 6 bucks or so back if you are out later than when the shuttle runs. I cannot say enough what a perfect location it is and what a great place to stay it is. I almost always stay with one of my partner hotels to get miles or in many places I look at Kimpton first then everyone else but Seattle is different. Maybe my love of baseball makes me love this place even more but whatever the case you cannot beat walking right out the front door and to your ball game seats in 5 minutes!

The hotel is just accross the street from the Safeco Field, all streets were closed by Seattle Police, detouring traffic, streets packed with cars and people. Managed to make it to the hotel despite all the traffic inconveniences, hundreds of pedestrians...first night, no problems, rested well, would have rested better, but there is a railroad facility close to the hotel and the trains blow their whistles at all times, day or night, so unless you are used to the noise (2-3 nights) you will be awake most of the time. Third day, friday, departed at 05:00H to catch the Ferry for Victoria BC . We made sure our room dooor was shut locked. Arrived from Victoria, BC on saturday afternoon and to our surprise our room door had a \"Privacy please\" sign, that we did not leave there. I thought my room had beed given away to another guest. After trying to open our room door a few times and seeing that the key was not working, we decided to give it a little push, discovering that it had been opened by someone else and left open. The room had not been touched by housekeeking at all, for 2 days. It was just as we had left it. Nothing we could do at that time since we had made reservations for dinner and were kind of in a rush. We called the main desk, asked for soap and fresh towels, which were delivered soon. After dinner we returned to the hotel, it was around 10:15PM, tried to open the room, keys did not work this time. Went to the front desk, reprogammed them, tried again, nothing. After going back and forth to the front desk to reprogam the keys, three times, our door still remained unopened. 5 staff personnel, (as if I did not know how to do it), came and tried to open the room, for a total of eight tries now, finally realizing that the lock was somehow damaged. It is now past 11:00PM, we are still locked out of the room and the maintenance person is gone for the night. Front desk stated that the hotel was at its full capacity and they could not provide us with a courtesy room to spend the night, therefore; we had to wait for the maintenace guy to come back from his home, at that time of the night , and see what was wrong with the door lock. We went back to the front lobby to wait there, were given two small bottles of Minute Maid orange juice for consolation, and were told that maintenance had been contacted and that within 15 minutes the problem was going to be solved. At 12:30 AM, after 2 hours and 45 minutes locked out of our room, tired and sleepy, front desk finally told us that our door had been opened by maintenance and that the problem was that the lock since it is electric, had run out of batteries. WHAT!!!!???? Don't they perform preventive maintenance or their equipment???? Don't they change the door lock batteries periodically?? For the price they charge for their rooms, the lock ran out of batteries, that's it??????. How do they explain that someone opened that door, left it open, placed a \"privacy please\" sign on the door, but no one reported that the lock was having problems? Needless to say my night was trashed, ruined, wasted. Next morning we were able to speak to Mr. Mark Lee, director of guest services, he was very kind and understanding of our situation. This hotel is not a bad one, it is just that you travel and try to book a good hotel, even if you have to pay a few more dollars, so you don't have to worry about things like these, but unfortunatelly, it happens.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver BC", "Title": "\u201cLocation is a little far away except for pro sports\u201d", "Author": "AlegreVancouverBC", "ReviewID": "UR36979959", "Content": "Got here by bidding on Priceline for $100 so Priceline did the choosing.

My husband just moved here a year and a half ago and I figured this would be a great cheaper vacation and he could become more familiar with the city. Location-This location was perfect for going to Safeco for Mariner games, you literally cross the street and are there getting your ticket scanned. Qwest field is also just across the street, so great for Seahawk and Sounder games as well. As for seeing other things, the closest area of interest is Pioneer Square which was a very doable walk, I'd say about 12 blocks. Just make sure you have some nice walking shoes on. We even walked back to the room from the downtown waterfront and it wasn't bad at all. Of course they have the shuttle though which will take you two miles within the hotel. Pick up the maps in the hotel lobby that have all the tourist destinations. Very helpful. Room-We stayed in a King room, it was smaller, what you'd expect from city hotels these days, but was comfortable for the two of us. Granite counter in the bathroom, a big tub, a wet bar with mini fridge and microwave and sink (also granite) with a very large flat screen TV and lots of free movie channels. The windows in the room opened, which was great because the room felt a little claustrophobic at night with the curtains closed (which are great for sleeping in-they completely block out the light). As far as noise, we definitely heard our fair share of trains during our five night stay, but it wasn't loud enough to wake me up once I was asleep, and I am a VERY light sleeper. Also, the windows do a great job of keeping out noise, there is a huge difference with them open and shut. Free wifi in the room too. Food-So the hotel has a restaurant on the first floor, Jimmy's on First, which we had dinner and breakfast at once. Dinner was okay, the food was just way too expensive for the quality it was. Breakfast was also expensive, I had the Sodo continental one morning and the amount of fruit was tiny, but the muffin was good. Service was great here though, the staff was always friendly. This place was never too crowded either, didn't have to wait for a table even before and after games. The Pyramid Alehouse is right across the street, we ate here twice and like it, but it's definitely bar food. If you want something fancy head up First Ave about 10 blocks to Il Terrazzo Carmine, expensive but amazing italian food. Shuttle-We used the shuttle frequently, and the shuttle drivers were always friendly even though they had to drive in hectic Seattle traffic all day long. You have to call ahead and reserve seats in the shuttle and they leave in 30 minute intervals. They do stop at 10:30PM which is kind of early, especially for the weekend so a lot of times we took the shuttle out and a cab back. Be aware that you can ride in the shuttle for a long time, for example we got picked up after walking around the city all day, got in and had to stop at five other places. We weren't counting on it taking that long and missed a dinner reservation. Service-Room was always clean, the staff was always friendly, especially at the front desk. Everyone from the waiters in the restaurant to the valet was nice and attentive. We were able to check out an hour late free of charge. No problems here. Parking-20$ valet only. Very cheap compared to the rest of the hotels in the city.

The bedroom was nice with a large flat screen TV, dressers, etc. There was a separate living room with a large flat screen TV, a sofa bed, and coffee table, and a safe. This living room has doors that shut so if you were sharing the room it would be great for privacy. The bathroom is the largest hotel bathroom I have ever seen. It had a full bathtub, a walk in shower, and a separate area with the toilet. The restaurant and bar in the hotel (Jimmy\u2019s on 1st) is ok. Nothing to brag about.

The hotel is literally across the street, and I imagine on game days, Seahawks or Mariners that place is packed with fans/clientele who like nice things. Pyramid brewery is also across the street, never made it over there but I think you can take a tour and it has a restaurant... The Best part of the hotel was the shuttle, I know you think shuttle...blah...no way, this shuttle took you everywhere you wanted to go. They had 4 drop off points but one night the driver took us right to the place we wanted to eat. Then said, call us when you are done and literally he asked me where I was and they picked us up. We only spent money on a taxi to and from the Airport. I called the hotel and they suggested a towncar and had the driver call me within 2 minutes, it was so easy. towncar was 45 dollars to hotel and 40 dollars back. Much nicer than a cab... meets you where you want, no taxi lines. Its just nicer. After reading some of the reviews we did hear those trains and yes they were loud, I'm not exactly sure how long they were making noise but we were confused on why they were going off and was it a boat, so we noticed it, but as you will see Downtown Seattle its all very port like, train like...you should expect noise.

I was staying in a room with a direct view of one of the scoreboards (Safeco Field ... as I live in UK I don't know which sport this is ... I think it's baseball!). However it is not really near anything else, certainly I could find no convenience stores etc. The hotel restaurant was nice. We had a good (if a little pricey) breakfast, but it was a la carte. Room service in the evening was excellent value and good quality. The hotel is really let down by its reception staff. When I arrived to check in, I gave my name, the guy on reception looked up my reservation and laughed. I asked him what was funny, he said there was a note on my reservation, I asked what it said he said he couldn't tell me. Made me feel a little uncomfortable. Then later asked another guy at reception for directions - he couldn't even find the hotel on the map. And in the morning checking out I had to wait 10 minutes foe someone to appear at the desk and then they had charged me for 2 nights parking when (a) it would have been a very long drive from London (!!!!) and (b) I only stayed for 1 night. No apologies, I had to justify it coming off. Also there is no doorman, which can make finding a cab hard (and opening the doors with lots of luggage). And they do not have umbrellas - so bring one - it rains a lot in Seattle I hear. Overall I had a very comfortable stay with a very good room and decent food. Service at reception was, however, unacceptable.", "Date": "March 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cOne word - \" Noisy\"\u201d", "Author": "yvan31", "ReviewID": "UR12071159", "Content": "Very nice lobby area and a big plasma tv in the room; room is small but should be ok for a short getaway; the bed is comfortable BUT the noise from the railway just keeps me awake for the WHOLE night!!!!

This hotel helped made this trip the best. We had the King Jacuzzi Suite and it was sweet. We arrived in Seattle at 9:30am and didn\u2019t' think we would be able to check in but no problem, we went right to the room. It was immaculate. The Jacuzzi had a beautiful view of Puget Sound. There were bath salts, gel and a loofa (sp?) We used it every night!!! The water was so HOT the first night that we had to wait for it to cool down. The bathroom was equally impressive. Large tub and plenty of space for toiletries. The bed was very comfortable. I read reviews about train noise but I have to say, we only heard the train while we were awake. We are sound sleepers and sleep with the TV on so, unfortunately, that may be why. Worked for us. We spent two days at Pikes Market...I love it. One day we used their shuttle, which was great. The next day we took a cab from a pub we were at and walked back. It was a great walk and found a little \"specialty shop\" on the way back. Jacuzzi time again. My husband loved the plasma and daily newspaper. OK, I will admit we were there for the Seahawk/Rams game and we are Rams fans, yuk. The location is no less than perfect for Safeco and Qwest. The Pyramid Ale House is across the street, which is fun. Jimmy's downstairs has the best breakfast. Their potatoes are awesome as are the Bloody Marys. We had room service our last morning and it was perfect and not prices any higher than going to the restaurant...a first!!! We loved it and won't stay anywhere else. Hope you like it too!!!", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201cLoved This Place\u201d", "Author": "dudesd", "ReviewID": "UR10267089", "Content": "Just returned from seattle. First time visiting and this hotel made it just the best experience. We loved the room, sooo clean and lovely to sleep in. The tv and movie service just topped off our evenings. The pool/hottub area are just awesome and overlook the pier area and the safeco field. It has a nice restaurant in the hotel as well right across the street. It is a little far to walk some days to the pike market or pioneer square but the shuttle offered could not of been any better. When we called for pickup it seemed like we waited no time at all and the drivers were fantastic with all sorts of suggestions. We used the shuttle extensively and it never let us down.
