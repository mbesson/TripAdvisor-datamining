While I am not always able to stay at this hotel (often booked solid) when I visit Mexico City, it is my favorite in the Polanco area. As other reviewers have noted, this is a boutique hotel \u2013 it looks just like a big house, while very small for a hotel. If you haven\u2019t been before you will probably pass it a few times before you realize it is the hotel. It\u2019s great place to stay if you are interested in a smaller hotel with more character (compared to rooms in larger chains that all seem bland and the same) and personal service. It\u2019s a smaller, quiet hotel. The bar/restaurant/lounge area is great for discussing business over drinks or a private romantic dinner (dinner at the restaurant is surprisingly nice) or if you are plain too tired from work meetings to go out. To be fair, toward the end of the year some companies will throw parties there \u2013 but I haven\u2019t had problems with noise in my room at night. And if the bar/lounge area is busy, they do have a meeting room available. It pays to ask ahead \u2013 whether you are planning a business meeting or a romantic getaway. For an upcoming trip, I\u2019m planning to have a prep meeting with some business partners and asked if at that time there would be any events or if that area would otherwise be busy or inappropriate for a meeting \u2013 the manager said no events were expected, but also reserved the meeting room for us \u201cjust in case\u201d. On another trip a few years ago, I brought my wife to celebrate our anniversary. I explained I wanted to do something romantic and the manager discussed some options and prices. When we arrived, the room was filled with flowers and there was a bottle of champagne on ice, as planned \u2013 it was a great romantic getaway. What this hotel is not is a big hotel with a gym and an active lobby bar where you can meet people, where you get points/miles for your stay, etc.. If you\u2019re a big hotel person, this hotel may not be for you. A nice feature of the hotel is the drivers \u2013 different from some larger hotels, I\u2019ve never had to wait for a taxi, even at rush hour. And the hotel taxis are competent and trustworthy. On a few occasions, I\u2019ve arranged for the taxi to meet me with my luggage at the company where I am having meetings and take me directly to the airport. This allows me to meet for longer with my customers without having to lug all my luggage with me to the meeting. Before my last stay (July 2011), I checked out the reviews and was worried by the number of posts mentioning problems due to the new management. I can\u2019t speak to the problems that other people had and I\u2019m not saying they didn\u2019t happen, but in my stay, I enjoyed the same excellent service I\u2019ve always had at this hotel. The management and staff really seem to take pleasure in offering a great experience. While I think Mexico, in general is excellent at customer service, this hotel takes it to another level in my experience. I wondered if maybe I get better service because I\u2019ve been a regular customer over a long time and speak Spanish, but on my last trip a non-Spanish speaking colleague joined me for his first trip to Mexico and he had no problems. My colleague ended up forgetting his credit card at check out and when we called several hours later, the hotel manager was relieved that we called and immediately sent a hotel taxi to bring us the card (sealed in an envelope and obviously we paid the taxi\u2019s fare). Obviously, with the kitchen and the home feel, this hotel is great for longer stays. Several years ago, I stayed at the hotel for a period of 2 weeks and it was great. While I didn\u2019t cook, the kitchen and refrigerator came in handy for storing and reheating left overs \u2013 especially as I worked a few all nighters in that period. Any hour of the night, you can get pretty much anything you need: a coca cola, an espresso, a pot of coffee, a shot of tequila,etc. Highly recommended.", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cThe Name Says It All\u201d", "Author": "MeowPaws", "ReviewID": "UR115711867", "Content": "My stay in the Casa Vieja was really like staying in an old house.

Often the term \"Boutique\" is applied to hotels that are simply small, this however is truly boutique experience. Small yes, but also intimate and with excellent service. We didn't get off to a good start when we arrived late to be greeted by the security guard. A nice chap it has to be said and very obliging but he didn't have a word of english. We made ourselves understood somehow and we were shown to our lovely room. We were exhausted from our long journey from the UK and after a snack at El Pendulo, a local restaurant, we collapsed into the very comfortable bed. The whole hotel is an extraordinary confection of vivid colour and spanish influenced hacienda. Our room had a kitchen, which is very unusual though I was struggling to understand to what use we could put it. There's not very much in the way of cooking utensils, though I imagine if we were staying longer and wanted to cook then the hotel would probably provide some for us. There's little point however, there's lots of lovely restaurants within easy walking distance. The staff were lovely and I'd like to single out Oscar and Fernando in the terrace restaurant for special mention. They were good fun and we were were treated very well by them. The location in Polanco is great with lots of restaurants and the excellent shopping on Avenida Presidente Masaryk close by. We also walked to Chapultepec Castle through the boisterous chaos that is Sunday in Chapultepec Park in about 25 minutes. The Wifi is included which is always a plus. We should no longer accept being charged for Wifi and should complain where there's an additional charge. The air-con wasn't working in our room.

However, I would strongly advise anyone against staying at this hotel due to a recent experience I had there. After a wonderful long weekend, upon checkout I paid for my stay but after arriving back home I found that they didn't reverse the deposit that was put on my credit card upon check-in. I also belatedly discovered that the hotel had also charged my credit card, presumably for some type of deposit, 3 weeks before I even arrived. After finally speaking with the sales manager, he explained that the hotel was sold in April and is now under new management, and blamed the change of ownership for the confusion. He was very sympathetic, apologized profusely, and said that the two incorrect charges would be reversed within days. Nevertheless, he couldn't explain why the hotel would ever charge someone prior to arrival which has left me very suspicious of their accounting practices. Many phone calls later I have now spent 4 weeks trying to resolve this unsuccessfully and as a result will have to dispute the charges through my credit card company. Which likely means that they will cancel my credit card, reissue a new one, and I'll have to deal with all the hassles that go along with that.

The hotel is, as advertised, an old house on a residential street between too bustling boulevards in Polanco (the Beverly Hills of Mexico City).

The rooms are decorated beautifully in traditional Mexican style, lots of bright colors, Talavera tiles, woodwork, lots of attention to detail. We felt like we were in someone's individually decorated home. The staff was very helpful, very attentive. They'll get you a Taxi, call for eating reservations, give you directions, change money, etc, with a smile, of course that's typical in Mexico as a whole, they do customer service better than anyone. The location is nice, a short walk to Polanco eating and shopping, a bit longer, but easy walk to Chapultepec Park and other sights. The Metro is only a couple of blocks away and cabs are everywhere. Highly recommend for a romantic getaway. Only negative as has been mentioned is that there is very little if any natural light in the room.
