{"Reviews": [{"Content": "STAY AWAY from this place Absolutely Terrible !!!! Do not stay here under any circumstance, even if its the last place in the city- go some where else. BE Careful !!-This hotel has another name it is New Orleans Palace Hotel on Canal. It is dirty and disgusting, the management is uncaring. Our room had a hole (not a crack) in the window, the A/C didn't work, the floor was not vacuumed, the bathroom door wouldn't close because the toilet was too close to it. The parking garage is barely lit and probably unsafe after dark. You still have to go all the way down to the street to enter the hotel. We couldn't even stay there one night.", "Date": "Nov 16, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR474592484", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Terrible Hotel This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We stayed from October 23, 2004-October 24, 2004.The hotel is in such a state of disrepair it is unbelievable. The first thing you will notice is that the automatic doors do not work as you enter the building (that might be a good thing, it gives you your last chance run away). The entire building has an overpowering dank smell. The carpets are very worn and faded and the sheetrock is falling apart. The rooms have rodent traps very prominently displayed. The television did not work. The shower was very dirty and when the hot water was turned on at the sink, brown water came out. The hotel staff was rude and absolutely unhelpful. They did nothing to address our problems. We checked out immediatley the following morning. These complaints were not unique to us. As we were checking out 2 other couples were voicing the same complaints.This is without a doubt the worst hotel experience I have had. Choose anyplace else.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR172711496", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "risingstar"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d483360-r2828771-Crescent_on_Claiborne_Hotel-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "483360", "Price": "$109"}}
