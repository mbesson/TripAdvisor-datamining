I spoke to the receptionist who stated that its 1st come 1st on and I would have to wait until the next bus at 9.30. When I asked if I would get on this she shrugged her shoulders and said 'maybe' What is the point in asking you what time you want to transfer if there is no system for booking onto it!?

Firstly, it is a 10 minute shuttle ride away and it's a lotto as to whether you get an English speaking/polite driver! 4/5 times, I appeared to have a losing ticket. As for the hotel, it is situated on a highway in the middle of nowhere and approaching it you can forget you're even in Madrid at all. Never the less, the entry hall gives a reasonably good first impression aside from a bizarre broken down car sitting in the middle and a driving range that seems to of been put in the middle of the bar area (?!). The reception staff were helpful and did speak pretty good English, after getting our key we made our way through what can only be described as an empty shopping centre and particularly when no-one is around it makes for an almost unpleasant environment. The rooms were actually decently sized and everything worked perfectly although the bath is somewhat questionable as it is about as shallow as my sink at home... The TV was somewhat limited in choice and unless you enjoy watching amusingly bad dubbing it's probably best to give it a miss. The bed was a little firm although a good size but the pillows were incredibly soft. The gym and swimming pool however were both in excellent condition and provided a pleasant view of the airport runway. The one key problem I have with this hotel is the fact that there is not a single restaurant within walking distance and as a result the hotel takes complete advantage and charges outrageous rates for food and drink. You need a minimum of 20 euros per person for a snack. The room service was one of the worst I've come across, and they messed up the only order I made 3 times due the fact that not a single person spoke English. In the end I had to contact reception and get them to sort it out. All for the sake of a 6 euro mug sized bowl of cereal. I would suggest as a result you make full use of one of the only decent perks of the hotel and use the breakfast buffet. Im sure this hotel would be fine for a business trip of one night only stay and your company was the one taking the hit. However if you are intending to go here for any other purpose or you have to pay for breakfast/evening meals I would strongly recommend otherwise. A few tips for those who do stay, if you want to get to the large shopping centre which is about 3 kilometres down the road (which has various restaurants and fast food outlets) you need to get the airport shuttle bus and pray the driver woke up on the right side of the bed that morning and ask him to stop, even if he appears to of completely ignored your request he most likely will of heard, do not be alarmed. As for getting into town, the easiest way I found was just getting the airport shuttle bus to terminal 2 and then getting a \"touristico\" ticket which allows you unlimited use of the metro network for that day (8 euros).", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cQuality hotel at decent price.\u201d", "Author": "Chad D", "ReviewID": "UR131169790", "Content": "I've stayed here twice with my girl.

The hotel is directly across the street from the airport, but due to the size of the airport\u2019s grounds, it was actually a 15 Euro taxi ride from the airport PLUS a 7 Euro surcharge because you were at the airport. The hotel offers a free shuttle, but I had no idea where to wait for it or how to summon it. You might want to call the hotel in advance of your trip to ask about the shuttle. I did take the shuttle back to the airport, which was VERY nice. Check in was a BREEZE \u2013 easily the fastest check in experience I can remember in years! The hotel is absolutely massive \u2014 reportedly the largest hotel in Europe! Guestrooms are built around a series of four \u201cblocks\u201d or towers, each with a central atrium \u2013 and the public spaces are extremely wide and voluminous. One would easily wonder why so much space is allotted to hallways and open spaces UNTIL you encounter a group like the thousands of multi-level marketers attending a rally on my arrival day. The place was just jammed with people. Once they left, the main floor of the hotel was a ghost town! Internet is free and quite fast. There is a rather well equipped gym and an indoor/outdoor pool. My room was very large with a big window that opened (even though the sign on the window says they can\u2019t be.) The floors in the main room are laminate and marble in the bathroom. There\u2019s a fridge in the room that had two complimentary bottles of water that were replenished every day. My only complaint is that the bed was rock hard \u2014 which just isn\u2019t my personal preference. Actually I do have another complaint. There are no irons or ironing boards in the rooms \u2013 and you CANNOT request one from housekeeping either. The ONLY option you have is to use the hotel\u2019s laundry service, which charges 6 Euro to iron a shirt!! If you\u2019re going to market yourself as the largest conference hotel in all of Europe, you really do need to provide business travelers with the amenities they need \u2013 and that includes an iron and ironing board, preferably IN your room! The breakfast buffet was included in the price of the room and had everything you could want for breakfast, served in a MASSIVE dining room. There is ZERO individual service provided by the wait staff, so don\u2019t expect to get anything other than what is offered. I also had the dinner buffet FIVE evenings. At a flat rate of 25 euro including tax and tip, you get a very wide assortment of salads, vegetables, desserts and hot dishes AND a bottle of their house wine, which was just delicious! There\u2019s nothing remarkable about the food, but it was decent and tasty \u2014 and there\u2019s really not much variation from one evening to the next. I didn\u2019t try the main restaurant, since the buffet was a much better deal \u2014 but I did grab a sandwich for lunch in the piano bar area, and it was quite good. CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED \u2013 There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the area of the hotel you can walk to, so unless you want to take a taxi into Madrid (about 25 Euro each way, 20 minutes travel time) or public transportation (a bus in front of the hotel to the subway station) that takes about an hour total for a fraction of the price \u2014 you are STUCK at the hotel.

Apart from the size, it doesn't deserve more than 2 stars and I advise you to avoid it is you can. I stayed there for business reasons: I was attending the congress downstairs. But apart from that, I wouldn't go there again. The Auditorium hotel is located near the Madrid airport. But you still need at least 20 minutes by taxi or by the (free) shuttle service to get there. It is located in the middle of nowhere, the only things you can do is either stay in the hotel or take a taxi to go to Madrid. In the hotel, you'll find it gigantic, for sure. Even the rooms are big (compared to other 2 or 3 stars hotels). But it's also cold and the service is minimal (except at the reception desk). There is an expensive restaurant where food is pricey and not even good ; service is slow and impersonal. There is a bar where the service is even slower and you won't expect any good food there. The bar is located in the main hall itself so it's very cold in autumn. The only good thing about the bar is the piano player (but he looks so sad, alone in his corner). Breakfast is expensive (12\u20ac) given the relatively poor choice and the absence of service ; tip: hot meals are located at the very end of the breakfast hall. Even for the congress, the service was minimal (e.g. waiters starting to take away cookies and coffee before the break was over - this is very cheap). As I wrote above, rooms are big. You have a big bathroom with everything you could need. There is a huge cupboard with a safe (big enough for a 15\" laptop). And there is plenty of space around the double-bed and the desk with two chairs. Big TV screen also (but didn't switch it on during my stay). Everything is fine for a 2 or 3-stars hotel, not more. The cleaning service is good however. And there is free internet access (free cable provided by the reception) In summary, it's not bad but avoid if you can. The only two situations where I can see people staying there are when they are obliged to stay there: either because there is an issue with their plane or because there is a congress in the very same hotel.

I would recommend it to anyone as long as they didn't get a room directly under the tennis court on the roof. The reception desk was outstanding and very patient with us English speakers. They were very helpful with advise on the bus and metro and treated us very well. They also helped me fax some business papers back to the states and they were very happy to do it for me. The common areas are nicely arranged and always clean. The internet computers and the free internet in the room (take a cable) were a big reason we chose this location and we weren't disappointed. The pool area was very nice and even on a chilly day it was quite comfortable to swim or lay on a lounge under the retracting roof. The room was very nicely decorated with a very upscale feel. The beds were a treat to sleep on and for the most part it was quiet. When the maids cleaned the room they did a very good job and it was spotless when they were through. There were a few times that we asked them to come back in a few minutes as we were getting ready to leave and they just didn't clean the room that day. Other days they had no problem coming back to accomadate us so it seems like they just decided not to do it. There is a large mall with food and shopping less than 10euros away by taxi and there were always taxi's waiting. The bus stops are an easy walk away and the fair was 1.60euros to the metro station and you could go one way to anywhere on the metro for 1.60euros more. So for for 6.40euros you could go to just about anywhere in the city and back to the hotel. Ask the front desk for the instructions on which busses stop at the Auditorium stop before you go. We had one meal at the hotel restaurant that was very good but rather expensive. We chose to eat out before coming back to the motel for the day which probably paid for our transportation for the day. There really isn't anything with in easy walking distance to the motel. As you could probably figure our room was directly below the tennis court which wasn't a problem most of the time. However a few nights they had some pretty aggressive players running, jumping, yelling and beating their rackets just a few feet above our heads while we were trying to sleep. The court is also in a metal cage and every few minutes someone would run into that which was especially annoying. They were shaking our room so hard that things on our night stands and TV stand were rattling. I called reception to complain since we had to be up early the next morning to catch a flight and got no answer. We called another number they listed and got someone that said they would take care of it but 20 minutes later nothing had changed. We called a number that was suppose to be the manager and once again we were told that it would be taken care of. Almost 30 minutes later at almost 11:00 PM the noise finally stopped. I can't say if they finally quit or if someone from the hotel actually went and told them to quit but it shouldn't have taken that long. For a hotel that caters to business people I would've expected the tennis courts to close at the same time the pool closed (9:00 PM).

This was not an intimate environment. There are grand areas in this hotel, with very large, old hallways. The hotel is reasonably well maintained, but some aspects are really old.

Not in my wildest imaginings would this inept joke qualify in anyone\u2019s rating system as even a single star. The hotel boasts that it the largest in Europe and close to Airport. Let\u2019s make a start on its short comings. Location 1) It is close to an airport but not the main one. The main airport is a 20 Euro taxi ride away. 2) It is in the middle of a particularly ugly industrial complex with motorway on one side and dual carriageway on the other, and bracketed by lorry parks. 3) It is a long, long, long way from Madrid centre and will cost anywhere between 20 and 35 euro's to get to Centre. 4) There are absolutely no amenities external to the Hotel whatsoever. Amenities 1) The hotel is a block design with approx 250 rooms per block (3 blocks) over 4 floors. Each block only has two small lifts serving it and No easily accessible stairs. Lifts are busy at all times of day and stairs are not an option. Fire escapes are external at the end of each block and are alarmed so cannot be used except in an emergency. 2) The gym is small and equipment is poor quality. At no point was any advice on equipment use available or offered. 3) Being totally isolated means that eating and drinking has to be done within the Hotel. They have made full use of this monopoly by making the most outrageous charges for everything. 4) Breakfast is akin to Butlins circa 1960 5) Staffing levels are always inadequate and ever single aspect where staff client interaction has to be undertaken is a nightmare scenario. 6) This is supposed to be an international conference centre and hotel. Only a tiny proportion of staff has another language other than Spanish. Staff were generally uncooperative, surly and lazy. There simply is not enough room here to list every aspect where this awful, awful place failed to meet even the most basic requirements for a quality hotel.

This hotel is FAR from the center of the city and no where near a metro line. We felt stranded without a car. They do have a shuttle bus that takes you to the metro and the airport but these buses are small and do not run often enough. There are many more people wanting to get on than can fit. People were actually arguing over who would get a seat. We wasted a lot of our 1 day in Madrid trying to get on one of these shuttles.
