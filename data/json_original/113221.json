The refrigerator in my room was n ot working, infact it was a refrigerator converted in to closet. when I complained, the staff told me that I am on wait list. Wait list to get a refrigerator and that too when its n one of my fault. Wow, that's Marriot, I can't belive. All tall buildings nearby and no city life to see. If you are planning your vacation for few days and want to visit Universal/disney and hollywood tour, I suggest you take hotel near hollywood.

Next morning on the way out again asked for a blanket we're told that we would get one also told reception about bedroom doors sqeaking in room was told this would be fixed came back that day no blanket and still queaky doors. Next morning went for shower no shampoo replacement, wet I searched through suitcase and found some. Later that day I came back to the room (still queaky door) and decided to have a sleep I put do not disturb sign on the door about one hour later I was awoken by the phone it was receptionist to tell me engineer was at the door to fix squeaks (it goes on I kid you not ) I rang to speak to general manager to complain I got man named cris I asked if I could speak with him (he did not offer to come up to me) he said he was in reception so I told him I would be right down, when I got to reception I was told he was on the phone after waiting a few minutes he came out and introduced himself and got my name wrong ( I only talked to five minutes before and I got his name right) .

A food wrapped in the wastebasket, two room keys on the bed, a breakfast coupon in another name on the desk. The highlight though was the half-drank Dr. Pepper on the bedside table. This prompted a call downstairs. While the desk clerk was apologetic, the manager who called me back simply moved me to the room next door. He \"knew that one was clean\" which was reassuring.

I would have expected something a bit more conciliatory than simply sending up a key for the adjacent room as a note of recognition they had checked me into a room already assigned earlier in the day. The room itself was typical Marriott -- you know when you are staying at one of their properties. The location is decent if you need to be in downtown LA.

I've read reviews complaining of this over a year earlier. Apparently nobody cares enough to do anything about it. It must have come as quite a shock to them that they were hosting a conference with 300+ attendees and that when it adjourned, many would want their cars. Some of us had planes to catch.

The internet does not cost them per your use. For attendees not staying at the hotel, it cost $70 per day. No excuse. Elevators were slow and usually crowded.

I had learned from other tripadvisor members that there is parking directly across the street in the World Trade Center.

So we headed across the street and spent $10 each instead of $30 at the Marriott. Ha! When we approached the check in counter we were greeted by the robotic front desk manager. He was very matter of fact and had little personality. He informed me that he didn't have any king beds as requested because the hotel was near capacity, which seemed odd since we were one of the only few people in the hotel lobby area, which is very large, impressive, but smelled liked old fashioned air freshener. It was terrible. As a platinum member I am guaranteed my room type. He stated that he had king beds on a lower floor. I said that would be fine. We then found out that he issued me a king bed on the 5th floor and my other 3 colleagues 2 doubles on the 5th floor. They were too tired to complain. My room was spacious but I felt like I walked into a room that was decorated circa 1992. I was dumbfounded. I only stay in Marriott properties and I have not seen anything like this in years.

It's a buffet served in a large sunny room looking out on the pool and run by mainly Hispanic staff who are among the most courteous, professional and friendly hotel staff you'll ever encounter. They offer bountiful fruit salads, cereal, cooked breakfasts and sensational omelettes. Next selling point is Moody's Bar and Grill off the lobby. Quintessential American sports bar with great variety of cocktails and beers and real down home USA cuisine Rooms are spacious with king size beds or doubles in the twin room category.

Location in the Downtown does limit dining/entertainment options at night but there's a cinema adjacent, the award-winning Ciudad restaurant is 3 mins walk, the Westin Bonaventure across the road has a rooftop bar and a ten min stroll to the 7th St intersection brings you to great restaurants such as Morton's, Engine 37 and Ciao.

It's in the business and cultural center of downtown LA and at the center of the LA freeway system. The Harbor, Pasadena, Hollywood and Santa Ana freeways radiate out from here and the Santa Monica freeway is just a couple of miles to the south. By car, if you pay close attention to lane signing when you exit the hotel and continue to watch the signs as you turn left on 3rd, you can almost immediately be on the Harbor Freeway heading north or south with the ability to transition to the other main freeways. Because of lots of merging in this area you need to continue to closely watch directional signs. But this freeway-friendly location has a downside if you get in the wrong room. Rooms on each floor are numbered from 1 to 48. Higher odd numbers are on the freeway side with the higher the number the noisier the room. Room 47 is the worst. Conversely, the quietest room numbers are lower even numbers, so Room 2 is the quietest. No room is without freeway noise, it's just a matter of degree. If you want a minimum of freeway noise ask for a low even-numbered room. This is a nice Marriott with a spacious and attractive lobby. The breakfast buffet is above average and only $19.95--a bargain by hotel standards. There is a person to make omelets, waffles, eggs to order, etc. Only valet parking is available and it's $30 per night. Wireless internet access in your room is $9.95 per night and was easy to connect to and worked well. I had excellent dinners at Zagat-recommended restaurants: Drago Centro and Water Grill. Both are within walking distance of the hotel. If you really like to walk, you can make it to the Convention Center or Staples Center by heading south on Figueroa.

The Valet are a hassle looking for money every time you come and go. WIFI was $10 for 24 hours if I recall correctly. It always irritates me when a hotel wants a guest to pay for WIFI. I will actually stay at a hotel just because it has free WIFI and for the ones that charge I know I can walk down the street to a cafe which will provide it for free. The Room The bed was great, so soft and lots of pillows, just what myself and my partner needed after a long flight. The decor of the room was a bit dated and boring. Lighting I found this a bit strange. When I entered the room there was a switch on the wall which turned on a light bulb over the door/entry area which is fine. What was strange is that there were no lights in the ceiling over the main room area including the bed. Instead there were 4 or 5 lamps around the room which I had to turn on individually. Even just one bulb in the middle of the ceiling with a switch at the door would have so much more convenient. Food The food and drinks were over priced and there are plenty of nearby good quality restaurants serving great food at the right price. I did not have any food or drink from the hotel. Pool I think I would give the pool a good complement. It was a nice area to chill out, enjoy the weather and go for a swim. The pool is a bit small in comparison to other hotels I have stayed at and you know your in the middle of the city. Would I stay here again? Probably not. LA has such a great transport infrastructure that its easy to get in and out of downtown in minutes. A day pass on the metro is $3 which also allows you to use the bus if necessary. I still feel ill thinking about the $150 I paid in parking. I really did not feel like I had stayed at a 5* hotel when leaving this hotel.

We got a double room (1219) with a view of the Harbor Freeway and downtown traffic. There were no issues with noise, however, and the room was quite spacious. One small drawback was that the television in the room was quite ancient. Also, there is no free Internet available in the hotel except with certain specific bookings. I needed to access the Internet to research the next stop on the trip, so I paid the $9.95 USD fee for 24 hours of wireless access. Also, I had been warned by other users about the valet parking, but the staff was courteous upon arrival and always had the car ready given a 15-minute call ahead of time to the front desk. The daily fee of $30 USD was quite expensive but in line with other parking garages I passed by in the downtown area. The main reason for choosing the hotel was its proximity to the Staples Center, about a 20-minute walk along South Figueroa Street. We attended a Clippers basketball game and a Kings hockey game there. The area can be a little shady at times, but I was never troubled on either night.

Great hotel and room for the price. However, and this is a big however, if you are on business and rent a car, then the ONLY option for conveniently parking is the valet which is $30 a day, making it among the biggest hotel rip-offs in the country. But as another reviewer has reported, much cheaper parking is available if you hunt for it (hint-- the hotel staff will NOT help you find this parking, or even admit it exists...the concierge and desk help will tell you that the parking price is \"competitive\" and even \"low for downtown LA\"). I could not do such hunting because of my limited time away from my conference, and because there was almost always bumper to bumper street traffic, and because it was raining all weekend. Further, every time you drop off your car, or ask for it to be brought to the front of the hotel, you must tip the driver. $2 is the absolute bare minimum for this kind of service, and so if you need to come and go about five times during the day, this is another $20 daily added to the parking thing. And these valets are very serious. There is a whole army of them, and then there is a supervisor who actually manages the order in which the valets are assigned to cars, and interacts directly with the hotel guests, and expects his own tip. Internet service is $10 a day, no free router in the lobby either, so if you are even remotely interested in getting anything done, you must pay up. A martini at the bar, not name brand but a well drink, is $10 before tip, and don't even try to make it up by eating through several tumblers of bar snack mix, your stomach can't take it. So, bottom line, when do you find yourself stressing about all these add-ons?

Live. We were looking for an inexpensive, convenient and CLEAN hotel in downtown L.A. for our stay. The Marriott was inexpensive compared to other downtown L.A. hotels, and it was convenient enough (walking distance) from the places we planned to see in downtown L.A. The positives: The hotel is clean. There were never any dirty towels or bedding. The staff was very nice, professional and helpful. It also felt safe. Our room was clean; it was a nice size and had floor to ceiling windows with a nice view of Figueroa Street and downtown L.A. from the 7th floor. The beds were comfortable as well. The negatives: This place could REALLY use some updating. The TVs are very outdated. They don't even have basic video/audio inputs. The furniture looks like it is from the 1980s. The carpet is outdated as well. It has to be at least 10 - 15 years old. All the light fixtures are outdated as well. Also, the lock on our door had several loose screws that I actually tightened myself with a pair of scissors. One thing that really bothered me was the lack of free Internet access in the business center. The hotel charges $10 for 20 minutes of Internet access. Neither of has had laptops so we ended up spending $30 on Internet access. Another issue was the refrigerator in our room. It did not work, so the hotel placed a note inside it stating that we could \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a portable one for a daily fee. Also, the elevators were often slow due to maintenance, and we had to take the service elevators often. The hotel only has one restaurant, which we did not try. However, the Westin is a block away and has more restaurants. There are also other places to eat in walking distance. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay, but I really think that it is on its last legs. A new Marriott is being built in the L.A.

If all went as planned it would have been very lucrative for my business. I was the only one this presentation featured. In other words if I was late it would have made me and my professionalism look VERY BAD because no one would be there to cover me. I made sure I was going to arrive 1hr early to my event in order to set up and make sure everything was going to work as planned. Nobody informed me about a convention on Saturday morning, the morning of my presentation, where the valet would take 45min-1hr to get my truck out of the valet. I told the Valet staff and manager my predicament after about 10minutes of waiting, after 20minutes I realized I was being ignored, and reprioritized. After 1/2 hour I started DEMANDING someone bring my vehicle! I was told it was on its way. I let everyone on the staff there know my situation and NOBODY could get me my vehicle. I even saw them bring people their car that had arrived 20minutes after me. I was now beginning to wonder if my truck had been stolen and this was their way of stalling so I DEMANDED to be taken to my vehicle. As I was getting ready to step in to a ride to the structure my vehicle was at it came around the corner. This was about 50-55 minutes from my original time I gave them my ticket to pick up my vehicle.

For Platinum members, their upgrade policy is very generous. Each time we have been there, we have been upgraded to a great suite. One of the times was a junior suite of sorts - which was an enormous room with a bilevel sleeping/living area with nonstop views out the window. This last time, we spent the week in the Vista Suite on the 5th floor (room 501) and it was an outstanding room with floor to ceiling windows on 3/4 walls, huge living room with dining area, a lot of space, a large bedroom with a really comfortable bed, and terrific room service for morning coffee. They were speedy, too. Also - their front desk service is phenomenal. Though we were originally booked for a certain number of days, when we called to change, it was all taken care of without any problems at all, no matter that they were booking a Vista Suite for the standard room price or anything. They accomodated us in every way. I should note, though, that for such a high-class room, their TVs really need some upgrading. They had 24\" tubes... and while this is just a minor details, it's details like this that prevent this hotel from getting 5 stars. Their hotel lobby is large - sprawling, actually, and while the layout is a bit weird (you have to go all the way to one corner to go up to your room), the lobby is always bustling with activity and makes for a good location for people to come and visit you, if you don't intend to head out to eat or drink. There always seems to be something going on, be it a party or convention, upstairs on the 2nd floor. Valet service was fast and efficient, and location is central to wherever you need to go in LA. It's right around the corner from the 110 freeway, and only minutes to K-town, 15 minutes to Beverly Hills (if LA had no traffic, which I should add, never happens), and merely 25 minutes to LAX - by distance, anyhow. I would not hesitate to stay here time and again - and would highly recommend anyone who plans to stay in LA to consider this particular Marriott.

I know this for a fact as I bought my first flat-screen Sony Wega TV when it was introduced around the mid-90s - yes, the TV in my room is of a much older generation with curved screen! (But at their lobby, they have 2 new-looking, huge plasma TVs. Talk about misleading ads.) 5. No free wireless Net access. Not even in the lobby. 6. Worst of all? The DO not always tell you when your packages arrive! You'll have to check with them daily. They actually told me that I have NO packages when I had 2. Yes, it happened to me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c twice in my short stay! 7. To be fair, the ventilation fan in the bathroom works really well, ditto that for their rain shower. 8. The following won't apply to you if you don't mind drinking tap water or paying US$4 per 500 ml bottle of water and if you don't mind taking a cab to almost everywhere as the closest subway station is about 5 to 6 blocks away. Nearest grocery store: 20 minutes walk or US$7 + tip cab fare away. Coming back will be uphill all the way. (The buses that stop near the hotel and run frequently stop running at 6.30 p.m.) The Westin, just opposite this hotel offers their guest free shuttle to many places. To add insult to injury, there are many other better hotels you can stay for less!

Turns out, I spent little time exploring downtown or L.A. for that matter. I got to see bits of the \"other side\" taking the subway/ metro from LAX -- super efficient, very easy (though sadly public transportation seems relegated to only those who can't afford a car) -- through some tough neighborhoods. In my 3/4 mile radius on foot, downtown L.A. seemed shiny, corporate, and sunny, but also abandoned after 6ish. The Marriott is well situated for biz visitors. The desk staff quick and efficient. The rooms spacious and acceptable, no particularly alluring details, but everything you'd expect in a decent hotel. What you really pay for I suppose at $300/night is location, location. However, since the conference was ALL IN THE HOTEL, why not pick one at the airport for half the rate? Maybe I'm too practical... Anyhoo, clean, neat. Stuff that stood out? - Room service was amazing -- LOVED their fresh fruit and smoothies, omlettes and hash browns especially. Excellent beef quesadilla, and grilled salmon. Stellar. Maybe that's a function of THIS Marriott. - Roy's restaurant and Takami nearby were both quite sub-par. Roy's wowed us in every other location -- Tampa, San Francisco, Honolulu, Las Vegas, except this one. Takami with it's views are great for happy hour, but little else. Pass on all three of their kitchens, see point #1, order room service instead. - A local friend took me to Korea town which has excellent, excellent Korean fare, and past a number of Mexican joints which we regrettably could not go to. This was within a 10 - 15 minute drive. - Short taxi ride to the Mayan nightclub which if you dance salsa, is an absolute MUST. They have parking at the Mayan, and car rentals were running $15 per day (never seen a more ridiculous deal), but we opted out. - Within a 5-7 minute walk to FedEx Kinkos if you wanted to sit on a computer for longer than 10 minutes (hotel has a biz center at $0.49/ minute), and approx 10 minute walk to a decent Mexican restaurant.
