The yummy breakfast of fresh juice, tropical fruit and pastries once was served on the second floor of an open deck with an almost tree-house feel, but now it is served in cheap plastic chairs next to the pool consisting of only cereal, bread, and concentrated juice.

The exterior looked abandoned. I stayed with a group and shared a room with a colleague.

We requested a room change and the only offer was a room with deteriorated appliances, hot and dusty. They offered to clean everything and they did but first they told me I could not be expecting a perfect room. The management even did not believe what I said about the beds that looked as never been changed. They came to the room to inspect and then they apologized. But first they did not believe me. I told them I was not asking for a perfect room but for a room in the minimal decent conditions for a person to stay and feel safe and relaxed. I found another dead insect when I uncovered the bed after they cleaned. The hotel is located in a very nice area (nature as its best) but away from the city (you need transportation to go around). The restaurant in the hotel was superb. You have to eat there. The hotel included a continental breakfast that had very few choices and variety per day. There was a very nice pool but it needed better cleaning. The view from the pool and dining areas was spectacular. Unfortunately one day when two of us served our cereal we found that it had \"gorgojos\" or food insects. It was disgusting. My experience there was more negative than positive. At this point and based on the bad memories I feel I do not want to stay in the hotel never again. The property is for sale. It seems to me that the owner is not interested in keeping the hotel in decent and acceptable conditions. To be fair, some of the people who traveled with me said they got nice rooms.

I also felt like it attracted a good mix of friendly people because of the price point...older couples who had been coming there for years, other young couples, some solo travelers and some families...so there was a pleasant, laid-back vibe. Cons: The rooms are pretty dated and bugs fairly present, bed a little lumpy (then again, I was 4 months pregnant so I might have been particularly sensitive!), and the location is tricky if you don't have a rental car as it is neither in town nor on the beach. A NOTE ABOUT RENTAL CARS ON THE ISLAND: they can be VERY hard to get ...if you don't have one already reserved don't wait until you get there as you will be out of luck! We even met several people who DID have one reserved and were still unable to get one when they arrived. The hotel tried to help us in the days leading up to our visit and while we were there but even she could find one. I have heard this may have improved with the W's arrival on the island but I wouldn't risk it. The island is very hilly so bikes probably aren't going to be a good option and the walk into town or to the beach is too far (and my husband and I are both very active and fit).

All and all, for the money, I would definately recommend the crows nest for the value that it offers. For the $145/night rate, you should first base your appraisal on the fact that on the island everything costs just a little more than usual. So, the rate gets you a pretty decent room in a quiet part of the island. Esperanza is tiny, but it does draw the night life crowd. The nest is far enough from that to give you exactly what vieques offers in abundance, tranquility. Also, the hotel is situated equi-distant from Isabel segundo and Esperanza, making it easy to go to either with a simple right or left turn out if the parking lot. One bug thing to point out: almost no other hotels offer television on the island. I know, I know, you might think that TV isn't why you went on vacation, but after a long day in the sun, it is actually nice to put on HBO and let the sleepies take over.

The pool and gardens at the rear are beautiful - nice to see how the grounds matured since our last visit. Pleasantly surprised that the breakfast provided was MUCH better than our first visit. There was lots of selection and it was very good. Here is my real beef about this place - in two visits (of many nights duration both times), the hotel staff were always less than friendly or attentive. It's like they don't even care you are there, or that you chose their hotel for your vacation. I always feel like I am \"putting them out\" by asking a simple question or mentioning something that might need to be fixed in the room (which it never was). It was a small thing, but at least an attempt to resolve would have been nice. This is why we won't be returning to the hotel for a stay on future visits and won't be recommending to our friends any longer. This is really a 2 star hotel now when I would have previously given it 3 stars. Don't get me wrong, we had a nice time - but there are just better places to stay for the price. It is too bad because this place is in a good location. But without sprucing up the rooms a little bit and considering the attitude of the management, I don't see any reason to return. There are lots of other places to stay that actually want my business.", "Date": "October 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cbest trip to Vieques\u201d", "Author": "LosAngelesCutiepie", "ReviewID": "UR10040863", "Content": "After driving around on the main land of Puerto Rico we saw a ad for the Bio Bays and decided we must see them before we head back to California.

Both my room and the room of a Crow's Nest regular (\"You got the worst room in the house,\" he told me) were just fine - functional and clean enough. My room was good-sized for one person. It had a kitchenette with a refrigerator and microwave, a queen bed, a TV, a desk, and a small bathroom with a shower. It wasn't the kind of room you could lounge around in, but that's not why you go to Vieques anyway. The other room I saw was bigger than mine and had a little porch with a table and chair. My room was right next to the restaurants at the Crow's Nest and I could hear every clink of silverware and note of conversation. Even after the restaurants close, you can hear them cleaning up. It didn't bother me that much, but if you're sensitive to that kind of noise, be aware. The Crow's Nest has wireless internet, but neither I nor another guest there could get it to work, and we both had the same problem and were able to access the net elsewhere, which makes me think the problem was on their end (although no one there even knew how to reset the system). The strength of the Crow's Nest is its grounds. It sits on this garden-like piece of land, high up in the hills, with views of mountains on one side and the ocean on the other. The pool area is beautiful and underused. Both restaurants - a steak house in a wood cabana and an outdoor garden grill - are charming and serve pretty good food. Staff at the restaurants are overworked at times, but try to make the best of it. As in most Vieques restaurants, the staff is a blast to hang out with but maybe not what you'd call professional. Go with the flow and you'll be fine; expect New York-quality service and you'll only be frustrated. I felt well taken care of at the Crow's Nest.

We bunked at the lovely Crow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nest, which, in spite of its non-beach location, has a long-range view of the ocean and a little slice of the mother island from the pool and fabulous garden. Our large room was really more like a casita, with a complete kitchen, indoor/outdoor dining, a comfy living room and TV with exceptionally good cable (But no CNN! So who cares?), a big bed and small but well-appointed bath (shower only, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge, and has a retractable clothesline for those ever-wet bathing suits.) Our room was excellently laid-out, and with first rate Puerto Rican-style ventilation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two effective ceiling fans and Miami shutters on large windows for privacy and all the fresh air you need. Of course, with this island construction there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no insulation from exterior noise, but the daytime voices of staff and guests were unobtrusive, and even at night, with both restaurants open, people were well-behaved, laughing and talking pleasantly, and everybody seems to go to bed early (which is wonderful for the sun-baked, pooped guest.) You will probably be more bothered by the crowing roosters every morning. Here the front desk and maintenance/housekeeping staff are truly warm and friendly, completely helpful and gracious about everything. They provide good quality loaner beach towels and rent snorkel gear. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an honor bar in the lobby well stocked with junk food (but pick up your beer/wine at the mercado down the road, no booze in the honor bar.) They also arrange your rental car (no Hertz or Budget on this little island) which includes a free ride back to the airport, and will book tours for you. NOTE! If you want to see the bioluminescent Mosquito Bay by electric boat (the alternative is to take a kayak and swim tour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which we loved, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only for the physically able) book way in advance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe when you reserve your room. The bay is kept ecologically healthy by severely limiting the amount of mechanical activity out there, so the one electric boat per night fills up quickly. It is a spectacular, do-not-miss experience you can only get on Vieques. We very much enjoyed the one dinner we ate at El Jardin, the pool-side bar and restaurant (see photo.) My grilled swordfish kebob was fresh and excellent. We did not try the Steak House. The self-serve breakfast is also outdoors (in a covered area) and hard though it is to believe, the machine-dispensed coffee is quite good. Bird-watchers, take your binoculars! Sitting around the pool we watched the gray kingbirds, hummingbirds (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153zumbadores\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Spanish) and pearly-eyed thrashers, among others. Elsewhere on the island expect to see lots of cattle egrets, other, larger egrets, frigate birds, brown pelicans, changos, and more. Back in Chicago now, 5 degrees outside, I really miss this place.
