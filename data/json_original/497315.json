I'd got a very cheap deal and hadn't expected too much but it exceeded my expectations. The room was clean and spacious, it was also quiet, though must add I was up on the 7th floor and would suggest getting a high floor is necessary for there is a nighclub down on the 1st. The buffet breakfast was fine and varied somewhat each day, so you'll certainly find something you'll want. The place was full of Russians on a package trip (that's not a complaint) and reckon I was probably to only British in the restaurant each morning. I never ate any other meals in the place so can't comment there. The Metro is now fully open and the station (Al Rigga) is only about 400metres away so getting around Dubai is very straightforward. Also it's only four stops away from the heart of the airport so I definitely wouldn't bother with a taxi. Yes, it's true there are quite a number of prostitutes locally but the neighbourhood isn't sleasy, though it ain't the area for sure that they show in the brochures. The reality is that however Dubai sells itself, undoubtedly a lot of people do visit for sex, as well or instead of shopping.. Personally I can't say I was overstruck with Dubai at all, but if you're there and on a mid range budget rather than wanting to dig deep for a fancy beach place, this hotel should do the trick.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ljubljana, Slovenia", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "Magnapurga", "ReviewID": "UR116745379", "Content": "I chose this hotel since it was the only one offering free wi-fi and free breakfast for under Euro 40 per room per night and did not regret it.

I called in to say that i would be booking in late as my flight did not get in till the early hours - which they were very helpful with. Check in was quick and efficient. Staff - throughout the stay- turned out to be very helpful. the room itself was very clean, spacious and (on 1st impressions) comparable to some 4 star hotel rooms. It had been recently renovated - and shows that it is a 3 star hotel due to some poor workmanship during renovation - but you would have to look carefully to spot them. Room cleanliness was very good - but i did find a toenail chip on the bed one day! Room service was very good, efficient and the food was of good quality. When it started raining one night - water started pouring in through the windows. When i called maintenance - they could do nothing about it and just said leave it till the morning and it will dry!!! The documents in the room say that there is FREE shuttle service to the airport - but upon inquiry it turns out its NOT free. You had to pay DOUBLE what a taxi would have charged. Though the hotel are generally good at arranging taxis for you - if you give them plenty of time. You had to ask for the PIN to get access to wireless internet - and that did not work for most of my stay! I did not get to try out the breakfast (which was included) and it didn't help that there was no information to say what was included as part of the package. Did not get to try out Gym, nightclub or the restaurants the hotel had on its premises.

Rooms are basic and are clean and comfortable and have plenty of space. I followed the advice from a tripadvisor review and requested a room on 5th floor or above and had no issues with noise. I wanted the staff to recommend places and give advice on where to go, which they couldn't. Logged onto the internet and read some reviews instead so not a huge problem. Just think that these little things add to service. Rooms are cleaned daily and staff were polite. Must be a new pool guy now as he was very friendly. The one day we used the pool he did shut it at 5.30 however. Went to the beach all other days anyway. Restaurant - breakfast had different items daily was perfectly fine. Don't drink the coffee though. We were half board - check this with your agent as they tried to give us breakfast and lunch and we had to get our agent to fix this. Food was fine - staff were pleasant. We were the only people eating dinner - heard that they stopped the dinner buffet due to complaints. Location - bad for most tourist attractions e.g Jumeirah beach side - costs about \u00a310 each way to Jumeirah in a cab. Metro is unfinished so can use to get to a few places only. Close to Gold Souk, Aviation club and a beach park. Bar guy and girl in the bar at the pool are lovely. We got ushered into Patriots (the ground floor entertainment room!) a couple of times by the staff. The first time we stuck our heads in and then quickly left - cheesy girls dancing on stage. The second time we'd had a few drinks in Carter's (Wafi Mall - nice bar) so actually sat down. I found it too embarassing and left a couple of sips into my drink. hahaha Agree with a previous review - the aircon in the rooms is really bad - it basically blasts freezing cold air for 5 min stretches to bring the room temperature down. Meant you had to either turn the aircon to a higher temp ot turn it off and boil, or put a cardi on! Dubai as a whole LOVES aircon - I hated being indoors as it was colder than in England - also meant that I developed a cold after a day due to the constant extremes of temperature. My no. 1 piece of advice - bring plenty of cropped trousers, and conservative dresses and t-shirts. My usual summer wear (knee length / floor length halter neck or strappry dresses / shorts) attracted way too much attention from the men in the area around the hotel. Plus carry a cardigan and wear trousers / jeans if you intend to go to shopping malls. I was told by a friend that you can wear anything you'd normally wear, in Dubai - you pretty much can but it ruins your day if you have groups of men constantly staring at you (probably thinking you are a prostitute). Places to visit: Malls: All the major big ones - Dubai Mall and Emirates Mall the best I think. Drinking - Best find was the Dubai Aviation club - very rare to find outdoor drinking in dubai and this was wonderful. Also you can find Irish Village - an Irish bar here. Try also Carter's (Wafi Mall - has an outside terrace and links to a couple of other bars), Mai Tai on Dubai Marina - near to the free Jumeirah beach. I would recommend this hotel as a cheap option - but would prob try to stay in the more aesthetically pleasing west Dubai (around Jumeirah) if I were to visit again - as far as budget allows anyway ;-) p.s. as per previous reviews - no-one can pronounce the name of the hotel (Ver-Say-Les is the most common but not always recognised proniunciation). No taxi drivers know where the hotel is - say it's near Taj Palace (thanks for that tip!).", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Almaty", "Title": "\u201cGood\u201d", "Author": "bounty0987", "ReviewID": "UR40091540", "Content": "The service there was quite good, the staff is polite.

The pool closes at 6 pm, which is not very handy, considering that it's so hot outside and leaving pool open till 8-9pm would me much more appropriate for the guests of the hotel. But what can you do..? Restarant was a bit dissapointing. Not cheap, but food was not very nice. We had much better lunch at the shopping centre food court than dinner in the hotel's restarant. So i wouldn't recommend it for dinner. Breakfast was ok, as it was mentioned by someone already- if you only paid for continental breakfast- make sure you dont eat anything from the \"buffet\" food, otherwise you'll be charged. Location of the hotel is pretty good. Overall, it's an ok hotel for 2-3 days to stay in if you are not planning to spend all your days in the hotel.

Neither the Emirates chauffeur desk nor the chauffeur had heard of Versailles Hotel in old Dubai despite it only being 10 minutes' drive from T3; that was the first clue that we had made a poor choice of accommodation. The promise of early check in - false! We arrived at 06:30 having been on a 17-hour flight and were told we were too early for early check in but should have a room at about 9am. We overheard the receptionist complaining the next morning that guests arriving early should pay for the half day before standard check in; turns out our room was ready when we arrived but we were refused immediate entry by the receptionist on a power trip. What a warm welcome! Have a cup of tea while you wait for your room - but if you accept they insist you forfeit your breakfast the next day. Also, the breakfast buffet isn't included in the room rate - breads and cereals are included in b&b tariff but are intermingled with cooked foods - put the cooked foods on your plate and you will be charged an additional fee. The room - when we eventually were shown to it is spacious enough but could do with new carpet. No tea/coffee making facilities. Hairs on pillow - I suspect a staff member on his break snoozed there before we got the key... Bathroom - mouldy shower curtain and grouting, dimly lit, hairs in bath, not at all pleasant. Sleep tight? I don't think so! The night club base starts thumping at 10pm and stops around 3am, so you'll get maybe 2 hours' sleep before the dawn call to prayer sounds out across the city, shortly after this the car horns start their chorus. The rubber sealing on both windows was partially missing so the windows didn't shut fully. Living in a quiet coastal town and having spent time in Paihia before Dubai, we found the noise very intrusive. Any plus points? The food is reasonably priced (roughly 70 Dirhams for 2 main course meals and 2 bottles of beer) and tasty, freshly cooked. Breakfast selection is extensive and for the most part, tasty. Honesty of restaurant staff is commendable; we had been accidentally short changed by 5 dirhams and the waiter came to our room less than 10 minutes later to apologise profusely for his error - we hadn't even checked the change and were completely taken aback at his honesty. If it hadn't been for this we would only have awarded one star.
