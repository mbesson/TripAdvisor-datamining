You could spend your whole holiday in a 1km radius if you wanted to! There is a free shuttle from the resort to Whalers every half hour and a bus to lahaina every half hour is only $1. The dream! The best beaches on the island are Kaanapali, at your door step! Pop your head under the water during the whale season and you can hear them singing, or you can just stand on the beach and see them breaching! We were really happy with this place, basic, clean and probably the best price considering we could use all the resorts facilities, with every thing we needed. A word to the wise though, most restaurants/ eateries close at 8 or 9 so dont leave dinner til the last min like I do.

If you like the show, you get it for free from your balcony, minus the food... The great thing about this hotel, is surely it's location, just \"on\" the beach. two steps out of your room, and you are walking on the beautiful sandy beach. On the downside, a few things to be aware of, and if you don't mind them, you can enjoy a nice vacation in Maui, for an affordable price. 1) Rooms are dated, old style green carpets, and bit shabby bath room area. 2) Mattress is old and not very comfortable. 3) No wireless Internet in rooms, and when in the main resort lobby, Internet beyond one hour is for $10/day. 4) No microwave in the room, which I always found kind of silly, since a cheap microwave costs one third of a single night rate. 5) When we checked in, I got a nice printed paper with the dates of our stay, to put on the dashboard of our car, showing the people in charge that we are eligible to park in the parking area. What they did not bother to tell us, is that we will be charged upon checkout $10/day for this parking. Bottom line - for budget travelers, this is not a bad choice.

Right on the ocean, on the Royal Lahaina Resort property, but the Kaanapali Ocean Inn itself is pretty dumpy. There is no elevator, the rooms are dirty feeling due to the outdated linens & furnishings and the forest green carpet. The bathroom was useable but the shower/toilet combo area was small. The shower itself was just a stand-up and the fixtures all needed re-caulking and the ceiling of the shower was gross. On our 3rd night after being gone all day doing the road to Hana, we came back to find a trail of ants coming from the ceiling to our kitchenette area infesting our not cheap groceries & a dead beetle under the night stand... We immediately called the front desk and they moved us to a cottage still on the Royal Lahaina Resort property (a MUCH nicer place, but the beds seemed the same). Both beds we slept in were very uncomfortable, paper thin pillows and the mattresses were hard, felt like the cheapest ones you could buy. Another downfall was there were no microwaves in any of the rooms. Food in Hawaii is expensive so grocery shopping and trying to do at least 2 meals in your room is really the way to go on a budget so not having a microwave really limited our food options. Another downfall is you have to pay daily for parking, something to keep in mind when looking at other hotels that offer it for free. If you are on a tight budget the Kaanapali Ocean Inn would be suitable because the location is great, if you can spend a little more at least get a cottage or a room at the Royal Lahaina.

Because of the low price, as well as the TA reviews, we didn't have high expectations about our accommodations. Yes, the Ocean Inn is pretty dumpy (toilet didn't flush properly; cottage cheese ceiling had severe water damage; daily charge to use the room safe: $3.75; peeling wallpaper; cockroach bait behind the sofa - and cockroach on railing of lanai). HOWEVER: we asked for and received AT NO EXTRA CHARGE an ocean FRONT room with a sliding glass door that opens onto a small lanai that looks out directly onto Kaanapali Beach, with spectacular sunsets and glorious morning views of the whales breaching in the channel. We also had direct access to the facilities of the Royal Lahaina Resort, which were very nice: great poolside restaurant/bar; ocean activities center with beach towels; poolside lounges; beautiful swimming and snorkeling beach; good parking; helpful and friendly staff - hint: ditch the luau - the entertainment sounded horrible from our balcony). We like to run and swim, so having the ocean at our doorstep as well as the beach walk trail going right through the property was great.

The resort is gorgeous and located on the beautiful Kannapali Beach (the section north of black rock). We stayed in room 1600, a corner room on the third floor with a king sized bed. with our 2 year old son. This room was excellent in that it only received slight (actually pleasant) noise from the nearby luau (which is over at 8:30 anyway). We travelled with older relatives who had room 1511 (middle of second floor, double beds). The luau was incredibly loud from thier room, but again, it is short lived. Room 1600 was a little more attractively appointed in my opinion. The rooms are indeed older and a bit dated but perfectly adequate. Bathrooms do not include tubs, only showers and tend to be damp. (Bathroom was poorly ventilated; there was some mildew stains/water damage. The maids cleaned it every day though.) The rooms were clean, no bugs or other nasties. On the downside, there were no microwaves in either room. We used the coffee maker to boil water for soupcups and had cereal and milk, bread, cheese etc in the fridge for occasional in room meals and managed just fine with our small child. The lanai's do not really have a view of much, just palm trees and some parking lot but were still a relaxing location to read or have a drink in the night time listening to the sounds of ocean waves and tropical birds. You can pay a bit more and get the ocean view in the same building. The wooden railing on the lanai is a bit rickety so take care with small children. The linens were clean and we slept well in the beds. There are stairs rather than elevators. A porter took care of moving our luggage and brought us to our building on a golf cart from the main building reception area. Service was very good and we felt that we were treated equally to those in the main hotel. Everything was close by and a easy walk. The restaurent in the main hotel overlooking the pool was good (a bit pricey, like everything on Maui). Avoid the Castaway Cafe, also located on the resort. Equally high prices but medicore to lousy food and spotty service. Cheap and tasty food can be found at the Lahaina cannery mall food court, by the way. It doesn't look like much, but the Baille asian food stand serves awesome vietnamese Pho and other dishes. The beach is excellent, good swimming, great sunbathing. Nice poolside atmosphere - quiet and relaxed by day with some hawaiian music playing at a low volume from the adjacent restaurent area. Beach towel use is free and we noticed they do occasionally pick up 'abandoned' beach towels to make the lounging chairs available to everyone. A hot tub and small pool is hidden up by the tennis courts (walk through the tennis building). It is open until 9 and rarely in use. The guest makeup seemed to be about 70% couples, 30% families at the time we visited. I can't comment on the nightlife aspect but I'm sure there's plenty of that to be found in Lahaina. No problem to get drinks on the resort to sip by the pool. A small market on the resort sells booze, snacks, diapers and other incidentals but its probably worth a trip to the Lahaina safeway to stock up on food etc when you arrive. Don't forget to pick up a few paper plates/bowls and a packet of plastic cutlery if you are planning on eating some meals in the room. There are also some on-resort shops selling a good selection of aloha clothing (not too overpriced) and souvineers. An ice cream parlour is also located on the resort. A nice treat for the whole family on a hot day. A poolside stand sells floats, balls etc for kids to use in the pool (reasonably priced) plus a more expensive line of skin care products and sun glasses etc for the adults. The Royal Lahaina Luau takes place on the property. The entrtainment sounded poor compared to the two others we have been to on Maui. Don't bother with it unless you get a really cheap deal. Overall, for location and price this place can't be beat. All the benefits of a beautiful well located beachfront resort without the high price tag. The room is budget but clean and functional. We've previously been to Maui and stayed at the Hotel Wailea, which was also a decent budget choice though not directly on the beach. The rooms at that hotel were proper suites with full bathroom and kitchen area. I'd suggest a rental car for any trip to Maui, especially if your hotel is not beachfront. There are so many incredible things to see and do on this amazing island.

It's a 3-story motel-type building containing the cheap rooms, and part of the Royal Lahaina Resort complex. Apart from the cheap room, travelers staying at the Kaanapali Ocean Inn are treated no differently than any other Resort guest. There is no lobby or other facility in this building, just rooms. All check-in and other services are in the main lobby of the RLR tower. The Kaanapali Ocean Inn building was built in the early 60s and basically nothing has been done to the facility since. And I do mean nothing. I'm pretty sure it's the same 1962 bathroom tile/fixtures, furniture, and hardware. When was the last time you stayed at a hotel that still used actual metal keys that you put on your key ring? They keys thing might scare some people from a safety standpoint, but remember that hotels and commercial buildings usually use key types that you can't just run to Home Depot and get a copy made. Probably they've changed the carpets and bedding/mattresses a few times over they years by necessity, but that's it. They keep the rooms and hallways as clean as possible. As far as I could see, only the 2nd and 3rd floor rooms and possibly the 4 ground floor rooms facing the ocean are occupied by guests. The other ground floor rooms appear to be used as storage, and two of them serve as bathrooms for the nightly Luau. The best part about this place after the price is the proximity to the beach. So if you have small kids and plan on spending a lot of time at the beach, with frequent bathroom/diaper change trips back to the room, this is extremely convenient, and you won't feel bad about going back and forth because you're basically going direct beach-to-room and not having to go through a lobby or anything. Rooms on the South side of the building will hear the nightly Luau goings on (over and quiet well before 9:00 PM, so not a huge annoyance). The ocean facing rooms have an awesome view, particulaly the 3rd floor. The North side rooms are the quietest. Some of the rooms (not all) have a sink and small refridgerator in the room. One other tip: happy hour at the restaurant/bar by the main pool and the tiki bar by the other pool is 2:00 to 6:00 PM, mai-tais are $5.00, and if the tiki bar is closed for some reason, the main bar will put the drink in a plastic cup to go (to the pool, back to your room, or to the beach). In summary, if you're going to Maui on a budget, this is the best place. If you plan to spend most of your time sight-seeing, relaxing on the beach, or other activities (and there are thousands), and you want to focus your time/money on enjoying yourself outside the hotel room, this is your place. Also, be assured that your room will be clean, and if you have a problem the resort staff will treat you well, and will do their best to address your issue as a resort guest (with no prejudice just because you're staying in the cheap part of the resort). Also, if you're interested, and if they have space, they will offer you an upgrade to one of the cottages. Just ask when you check in. Sometimes the upgrade is free, sometimes it's an additional charge, but always less than what you would have paid by booking a cottage room to begin with.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winchester, TN", "Title": "\u201cVery good value and information.\u201d", "Author": "rfherrell", "ReviewID": "UR90185392", "Content": "We were at the Ocean Inn for 2 weeks, Dec 1-15th got an ocean front first floor room that was worn and outdated, asked and received another ocean front room on the 2nd floor which was much better and newer furnishings.

We stayed at this resort which happens to be part of the Royal Lahaina Resorts and is also next the LUAU. We really enjoyed our stay here for 5 nights. The key things were the fact that the beach was right there no need to walk that much and there were places close by to eat. We ordered out from The Table pizza place it was really good, and also ate at the China Bowl which was good as well. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go the terrace at all but did go the Cast away cafe the food quality was very great. Snorkeling was at the Black Rock in front of Sheraton, maybe 15min or so and your were there. Its best to go early when its not that full of people around so u have better visibility plus water current is less strong. They do have many assorted fish and its quite neat but be careful with getting pulled away from the shore wear your fins and if possible some floating device too. We had the opportunity to snorkel while a huge marine turtle was eating on the side of the Royal Lanaina Resort just by where the beach shore ends. We took a cab to Lahaina Town and it was very nice since they have many local artist on the main street with beautiful exhibits, there are also many shops and places to have decent lunch or dinner. Try the famous shaved ice you choose your flavor. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget to eat Maui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Golden Pineapple.

Some of these reviews almost scared me away. I decided to take a chance since we were only coming over to Maui for a quick trip from Oahu. First, this is not a 5 star resort.

They checked a clip board and said \"Welcome Home Mr. Silva\". Check in was a breeze and we went to a very cute room that was in sort of a 4 plex. Our room was older but everything worked. We had a lanai with a beautifull view of a Banyan tree. I could not believe the price. < 100 bucks a night! We got unpacked and headed to the pool. We discovered there were 2 pools. We liked the one with the poolside bar. We set up our lounge chairs facing the ocean and proceded to drinking happy hour Mai Tai's. I can't remember (good sign?) how much the drinks were but I think the range waas $2.50 to $4.00. We pretty much did not move more than 300 feet the next 6 hours. Back to the room, dressed for dinner and headed to Lahaina (about 5-10 minutes). Returned at 9pm, was greeted \"Welcome Home Mr. Silva\" and headed back to the room. BTW, These rooms were quiet. Could not hear anything except tropical birds. Great night sleep. The next morning we had breakfast near the second pool seated outside. They had a wonderful menu but I chose the buffett which had a wide assortment of breakfast items including Portuguese Sausage. It might have cost $11 or $12. It was a deal! Anyway, the visit was just fine. On check out day my Cousin and I wanted to head to Waimea but the girls wanted to stay by the pool. We checked with the front desk and they said they would provide a room for showers when the girls were ready to leave. They made an appointment for 5pm and got an entire extra day by the pool.

For us, we travel so frequently, and Hawaii is a quick flight and easy for us so the budget part is perfect for us. The Kaanapali Ocean Inn was part of our Pleasant Holidays package. We were on the 3rd floor and had nice ocean view - opposite side of the luau, but one the line for the luau side. Thankfully we were never in the room much during luau time. And if you are in Maui - why would you be in your room during those hours? You should be out enjoying the ocean and sunsets. Pros: * The Kaanapali Ocean Inn is on the actual property of the Royal Lahaina. Full se of all its amenities and mostly private beach. We liked the seclusion of this property in contrast to most of those on the Beachwalk. * It is very easy to walk to the connecting Beachwalk where most restaurants and other hotels are. There is also a free Kaanapali shuttle to take you into the Whaler's Village/Beachwalk. * The hotel room itself was very clean and spacious. * More chance of getting ocean views in your room than the Royal Lahaina \"cottages\". Cons: * Outdated decor. * The bathroom door on a hinge is kind of weird and again, outdated. * Standing shower only, no tub. Not a big deal to us, but I know a lot of people mind. * No elevator. If this bothers you, I would request a 1st or 2nd floor room. * There is a mandatory $10/day parking fee even if you don't have a car. But mostly everyone rents a car in Maui.

Not sure if they just cleaned it or there's water running from the sink onto the carpet. They didn't have any king size beds available, so we were given 2 queens. The covers looked very old & dingy and I felt dirty just looking at it. I figure, I've been in worst locations when I was younger. I went into the restroom and the there was mold on the shower tiles and rust in the exhaust fan grill. The shower felt like an old high school gym shower.

There's this friendly Hawaiian fella that sells them out of a small stand. Sorry, I don't know the name of the town, but you can't miss it. 2 loaves for $10 is not bad, since they are bigger than most. And did I mention still moist and good 3 days later. Great breakfast item. Anyways, by the time we came back from our trip, it was late and we came back to the room. Very disappointed!!! I couldn't believe that after that nice drive, I have to come home to this. So, I called the front desk and asked them to move me to one of the suites at the Royal Lahaina. The price would have been $100 per night for the upgrade, but the front desk worker gave it to us for $50 a night. I took it in a heartbeat. When we got into the suite, it really felt like a vacation. It was immaculate. The view could have been better, but the room made up for it. The rooms at the Royal Lahaina have gone through a very expensive upgrade. Before I end this babble of mine, ask yourself this, you spend 1 year working hard for your money and look forward to a nice relaxing vacation on a tropical island. Don't be cheap. After experiencing the beautiful island and a long drive to Hana, you want to come back to a nice room and just veg out. Don't skimp on the room. It's well worth it. Just think, you can save money and stay in a horrible motel or treat yourself a little for your hard work and stay in a nice hotel. Believe me, it will make your vacation more memorable.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oahu, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cA Great Option!\u201d", "Author": "Islandhop_cg", "ReviewID": "UR21943703", "Content": "Here is the scoop on this place.

The location is ideal, at the quiet end of Kanaapali beach and you can use all of the facilities of the Royal Lahaina hotel which is right next to the Ocean Inn. The rooms were extremely spacious and the bed linen was really clean and the bed comfy. We weere on the second floor and there was no lift so this could pose a problem for those with walking difficulties. We had a view of the car park from our balcony but spent very little time in the room so this was not a problem. There was a coffee maker and refrigerator in the room which came in handy if you wanted a hot coffee or tea late at night or early morning or a cold beer.

We flew in, drove a convertable over and planned on spending one night and attending the Luau (slightly cheesy but alot of laughs and the pork is unreal) and visiting Front street and Maui and spending time with my family who live in Santa Barabara. I am from Virginia Beach and was traveling with two young adults and a seven year old. I am a very picky traveler when it comes to hotels but my cousin was very generous and was picking up the tab for the room and booked us in ocean view---two queen beds. I thought I would be staying at the Royal Lahaina. We came over last minute and this was the only room available on the property. The popcorn ceiling was falling apart and the bathroom had mold and mildew. This is not a room to stay in if you have asthma or allergies. The hotel is really really dirty (cobwebs in the hallway) and half of the rooms look out on the luau (yikes)--but you could watch it for free....ha ha ...there is a smell of warm trash in a dumpster as you walk in the place. The doors to the rooms and the balconys are old and dirty. The shower head sprayed water up on the ceiling which made big drops of condensation that landed back on your head as you showered and the shampoo was horrible----tangle shampoo. The shower experience was the worst--I should have just rinsed off at the pool. Our ocean view looked over private massage tables and the line for the luau. Imagine a line of luau goers outside your room as you get ready. Our balcony was old and the railing wiggled. My cousin called the front desk (he is picky too) and we were upgraded to the ocean view--which had a nice clean ceiling, normal shower (small) and okay beds. (hampton inn blows these beds away) and slightly upgraded shampoo. The room was cleaner also. I opened the door and the view and the sounds of the ocean at your bedside did make sleeping a dream. So for oceanfront sleeping in Maui this was not a bad nights rest. (The door was off the track mind you)..... This is not the Royal Lahaina--but a good deal for a night or two--my time at the resort with my cousin and in town was really fun and I am glad I was upgraded to the nicer room. However, if you are on a honeymoon or something special stay at the Royal Lahaina instead, Those rooms (oceanfront) are really nice. They have wonderful upgrades to make you feel special.

Also, the sheets were very scratchy. I should qualify this review by mentioning we stayed at the garden terrace (2 story structure), not the tower -- I have no idea if the tower is any better. We complained to Hotwire since this hotel was at the time considered 4-star, according to their ratings, which wasn't even close. I'd say 1 star, assumming no cockroaches. If you have ever used bidding sites like Hotwire you know that the star rating is extremely important, as the rating, price and location is the only information you have beforehand. Btw, Hotwire didn't do anything for us except issue lame apoligies -- I will never use Hotwire ever again. The hotel staff did replace the bed sheets after we complained, which was nice.

A very nice condo which is where I will stay at next time. Everyone we talked to loved it there. Very frendly people work there and food and beverages are alot cheaper. A tropical drink is $2 less for example. Visit the village of LaHaina down by the boat harbor and do some shopping. You can also buy a boat tour to do some whale watching. The whales are in Hawaii January-March to give birth. Alot of shops and eating is good there also. The road to Hana was alot of winding roads and is pretty but the road was closed coming around the other side so we had to go back the same way. My teenage kids were both car sick. I would check on the roads first before you drive it. Allow yourself extra driving time from Kahului airport to the Kaanapoli Beach are. Traffic gets pretty heavy.
