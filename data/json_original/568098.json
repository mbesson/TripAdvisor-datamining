Breakfast was basic and this was the first time ever anywhere in the world that the kitchen had run out of eggs for breakfast, don't they have Tesco's in Chingford ?

This was the only hotel left in the area with room available. Think it must have had a bit of a refurbishment. Room very clean with comftable beds and flat screen tv. Bathroom small but adequate. Yes you could hear other guests coming and going but this is the case in a lot of hotels. Breakfast very good. The hotel certainly does not warrant the previous comments. Can only assume that it was refurbished after comments were made.

Worst rip off ever . I do not recommend staying here at all let alone for a romantic occasion or pre/post wedding event. Before we got to the room we were handed a worn out door key and thought nothing of it .As we got in there were 3 switches for the 5 lights however 1 switch did nothing and only 3 out of 5 lights working. When we asked about getting replacement bulbs the attitude of the reception staff was \" I don't know why you need the lights working when your only sleeping in there\". However we did need lights as the bridal suite had one wall of patio doors a nice feature had it not overlooked the communal gardens and dining/breakfast room so our curtains had to be permanently closed as everyone could see in ! Then another advertised feature of the room was the jacuzzi bath as i tried the bath i discovered it did not work. The night porter was very helpful and accommodating when she couldn't fix it and said sorry , however later when we complained at the end of our stay we were accused by the manager of lying and breaking the bath . The reception lady's attitude was also very immature with a he said she said attitude. This was not the end of our disaster , there was damp on the walls, two broken lamps, plug sockets hanging of the walls , clearly against any health and safety regulations, outside our patio doors there were cigarette butts and also rather suspicious looking 'cigarette' ends. Considering there was a clear poster saying no smoking we found this quite disgusting. We also had a broken kettle , which we were then told by the manager was not broken again we had 'lied' however the night porter had brought us a replacement previously which we were happy with . There were other various small broken parts in this room , which they charge \u00a3120 for including cigarette burns on the duvet and broken pillow covers and broken shower parts. The room was fairly clean but not entirely hygienic by anyone's standards. We were grossly over charged for our room and breakfast was no better , shocking service and limited amounts of over and under cooked food. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE RIDGEWAY to anybody . We will never go back and we our taking our complaint as far as we can .

I was unhappy with the manager's attitude from the start. Both the manager and owner weren't very accomodating with regards to our needs and what WE wanted and kept trying to tell us what we SHOULD have rather than asking us what we would like and what they could provide. We were told we could decorate the marquee the night before the wedding, but when we got there, the marquee had only just been put up, the carpet hadn't been hoovered and there was no linen on the tables. So the groom and best man had to do it on the morning of the wedding! We asked for 6 guest tables and only got 5! A buffet was laid out and the food (which was actually very good) was replenished, but was cleared away at around 10.15, well before the reception had finished at 11.00pm. We weren't even asked if we wanted the food cleared! OVERALL I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE SERVICE AND THE ATTITUDE OF THE MANAGER AND OWNER AND WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO STAY OR HOLD YOUR EVENT!

That does not make up for the poor quality of the \"hotel\" the throw on the bed was dirty, the brown sheet underneath dusty, ended up sleeping under just 1 white cotton sheet which was clean! Bathroom so small you had to side step past the sink to get to the toilet, Couldn't put your arms out in the shower to wash you hair! you put your phone on the bedside cabinet and by the time you pick it back up there is a layer of dust on it. We only went for breakfast one morning of our three day stay, wish we hadnt bothered! There were two of us, a harrassed woman came out of the kitchen and asked what i wanted for breakfast (bearing in mind you have only a choice of 3 items!! No full english here) i said my choice and the woman walked away without even asking my colleague what she wanted!! 15 minutes later my breakfast came and the woman said to my colleague i understand you dont want any breakfast even though she hadnt even had a chance to make a choice. but one look at mine and she knew she had made the right choice! I got 1 sausage, 1 slice of bacon and a spoon of beans!! The sausuage was clearly raw. it had been turned once in the pan. I cannot stress how poor quality this hotel was, I feel mean as the actual reception staff were great, it seems a shame.

I changed rooms because of a non-functioning light which I made several trips up and down the stairs to try and unsuccessfully rectify, but worse was to come. Unfortunately I didn't find out the bed base in the second room was knackered at the head end before I wanted to go to sleep so I had to put the pillow at the other end. It was lumpy, obviously beyond its useful life and I wouldn't even be able to give it away; it was an ex-bed. The hotel is frequented by night shift workers, and those in the next room liked the TV on loud and weren't shy in sharing their conversation with me either. About 1.30 am. they went out slamming the door too but peace and quiet were restored. Breakfast is an exercise as to how little they can get away with letting you have. Fruit juice OR porridge OR cereals etc. Followed by bacon egg & tomato OR sausage beans and egg etc. (you can only choose three items) so a full house doesn't exist. The coffee was undrinkable sludge. On departure I took up the state of lousy bed with the owner who had the gall to deny she knew anything about it as she didn't sleep in any of the rooms (I would never have guessed). Considering the state of the other room it makes me wonder if they are all so tired. A \"hands-on\" proprietor? I don't think so! It cost me \u00c2\u00a354 for b & b which was about as poor a value as I've experienced. I stayed at a Best Western in Brighton a couple of months previously for 2 nights for \u00c2\u00a358 in total including a huge breakfast. Fire regulations are breached as all fire doors on the first floor were propped open with door stops the whole time I was there (mercifully not too long). The Advertising Standards Authority might like to look at their website that states it's fully refurbished. When exactly? Circa 1990? The Trades Description Act might also come into play too!

Having been given a very warm and down-to-earth welcome on arrival at the hotel our sprits rose... until we reached the room. I don't have an issue with a bit of old fashioned 'fawlty towers' style charm, but the bed that I nearly tripped over as I entered the tiny attic room (access to the bed from one side only), the toilet 'room' so small that the door needed to be opened in order to 'sit down', the shower that appeared to have slowly leaked into the bedroom over a period of years causing much peeling of paint, the wafer thin walls that leaked every noise, the layer of dust on every skirting board and carpet edge, and the general impression that we were staying in a spare room of a student digs, all left a feelng that, even at a budget price, we were not getting value-for-money. The breakfast fared little better. Whilst I was given a 'full English' on request, the breakfast menu only offered seven combinations of only three cooked items, presumably to try and cut costs. Serviettes were not supplied on the tables. On a positive note, our friends stayed in a non-attic room which was definitely acceptable at the price and appeared to have been more recently decorated. I really wanted to give this hotel at least two stars as I felt the staff were at least trying to make an effort, but it is impossible to excuse its faults at any price and I cannot recommend the hotel.", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North West UK", "Title": "\u201cvery basic\u201d", "Author": "cloud9NorthWestUK", "ReviewID": "UR7849131", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 1 night only which was quite enough.
