My only other hotel was the Sky City Marriott which cost 50% more. If you're counting your nickles and dimes this hotel might be the place to stay. But, for me, I will probably spend more if I have to go to Hong Kong again. I did appreciate the staff and the free Internet. I didn't appreciate the lack of cleanliness.

In paper, the hotel was a good choice. It's one station away from Central (Sheng Wan) and its near the Wholesale Market if you're into trying different local foods. However, it was a long walk going to the MTR station (around 20mins). It took us forever to find it on our first night. I thought by the 2nd night, we'll get the hang of it, but still we got lost and just took a taxi from the station. Same story on the 3rd night. Accommodations were fairly typical of any HK apartment/room. Very small but the space is maximized. The room was equipped with ref, blower, hot water and cups for coffee, complete set of toiletries, complimentary water bottle daily,TV with cable. I definitely got a good bargain per night because I only got it for less than US$40. If you're just looking for a place to sleep in, you can definitely bunk here.

I've been searching all over the place for things within his budget during peak season (October has lots of fairs going on so hotels get packed and charge an arm, a leg and your neck cuz they can).. stopped by the place a random night after calling and asking about specials for bi-weekly rates. was greeted by a girl who kinda lacked the 'hi, welcome to bridal tea house' kinda attitude, but her supervisor was A LOT of help. they let me see a room, which, knowingly was small, but kinda old (think of a holiday inn on your average american random highway)... pretty clean.. but since i saw very nice pictures on their website, asked the supervisor about it... she helped me check other BTHes to see if they had any rooms, and whether the size of the rooms would work out.. Once you see the elevators (aka lifts in HK) you'll get an idea of the size of the rooms.. you've got all you need there though, and if you're planning on doing a lot of partying anyway, this'll be a good choice (cuz it's nice on the wallet). might not recommend shopping until the later end of your trip, as you might not have much space to place what you got in the room.. Location wise it's not too bad. as it mentions you've got lots of buses, minibuses, the tram and such to get to and from.. the area has a mix of old HK and new HK, so you've got your fair share of fast foods but also congee breakfast places too.. did see an old school grocery store though when i was there, that was pretty cool. Mind you i speak the language so it might have helped; they are willing to help as long as you tell them what you need, and also be understanding as it is a budget place.. i must say they did go out of their way to help me out though.. i also checked out the BTH in Aberdeen.. will be writing up a review shortly.. I'll be checking out the one in Ap Lei Chau tonight, so I could probably write up another one too. : )", "Date": "September 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cOk but not the greatest\u201d", "Author": "mshk7890", "ReviewID": "UR22495736", "Content": "We stayed at the Bridal tea house at Hung Hom for 17 days btw Nov to Dec 2008. The room was spacious and adequately equipped with fridge and hairdryer. However we encountered a number of hassles during our stay. The sound proofing of the rooms suck which means you can basically hear everything that goes on in the next room or out in the hallway. A few idiots smoked in the hallway and in hotel rooms (apparently a common practice for the usual customers who stay in this hotel) and had to threaten to call the fire department because of the closed air circulation within the hotel rooms. The hotel has a policy to not change the cups/glasses in the room due to health and safety concerns for the cleaners. The rooms are reasonably clean although some sheets were stained. Front desk and kitchen staff are not the friendliest although some are ok. Great location, reasonable prices.

The bed was comfy and while we could hear a fair amount of street noise, the windows did a reasonable job at keeping this to a minimum and I didn't find that it disturbed me too much. The hotel is a good 15-20 minute walk from a metro station, but very close to a tram stop and a stop for one of the airport bus routes.
