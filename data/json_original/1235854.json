The hotel was very modern and quiet. Breakfast was delicious -- they served eggs, waffles, sausage, and fruit.The location was a plus as we were only 15 miles from DFW airport and 6 miles from the Kennedy 6th floor museum. The only negative (not hotels fault) was our GPS could not find the address. Try punching in 'Tom Landry Highway' and not 'DFW Pike' or IH-30.

Very spacious rooms, complimentary breakfast, the only thing that bothered me was that it had only one elevator which was kind of slow but other than that everything else was great. The bathroom is a good size, there's a sofa bed, Fridge, microwave, ad flat screen tv in every room and the hotel is right off of the freeway.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cComfort Suites Dallas...

I usually stay at this particular brand of hotels for all of my business traveling needs. First, hotel is very new \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe between 1-2 years old, but just a guess. Thus, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153newness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the hotel is apparent and reflected in the quality of the rooms, d\u00c3\u00a9cor, cleanliness, etc. Rooms are appointed nicely with a suite-type of layout including sitting/living area, desk or office work space, king bed (with comfortable mattress and linens), and very clean bathroom and shower. Very impressed with the rate of $90/night. Location is so-so. Kind of far (for me) from downtown Dallas for meetings or business, but then again travel is a must anywhere in the metroplex. However, there is a great selection of fast-food and sit-down restaurants in the immediate area close to the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so, that helps for dinner plans in the evening. Breakfast was nice, basic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fair, but good enough to eat. No Manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or Happy Hour reception, but then again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most Choice Hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have these now-a-days, so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault them for that. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see or use the gym or outdoor pool, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure they are just as nice and new as the rest of the premises. Internet worked great on laptop, but not so much on cell phone - still, very good. Cannot recall any problem or any fault with this property during my stay, and will most definitely be back!
