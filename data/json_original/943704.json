When you enter you have to pay for your capsule using a vending machine and then take off your shoes and clothes and change into the slippers and pyjamas that are provided. Men and women sleep on different floors with a communal area on the top floor with a tradition Japanese bathhouse and great views of Tokyo.The location is excellent, on the riverside with a subway station just across the road and aside from the novelty aspect of capsule hotels; this place is also really good value for money for those on a budget in an expensive city like Tokyo. Both the communal areas and the capsules are very clean and I would most definitely recommend this place to travelers on a budget or someone just wanting to experience the real Tokyo.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR325163331", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gemmasnook"}, {"Content": "Hostel deluxe!
