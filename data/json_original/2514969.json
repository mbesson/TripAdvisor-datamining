First impressions were not very good as the man who served us was very rude and obnoxious.

His attitude did not change at all even when we attempted to speak to him in French. When we were finally allowed in the room the room was tiny. We pretty much had to jump onto the bed from the door. The room was furnished with unnecessary stuff which made the room even more cluttered than it needed to be. We were left with no towels one day as the cleaners had taken our wet ones. The cleaner also entered our room after being explicitly told \"no\" by myself and my husband. We also had the money, for the hotel, deducted from our account without being notified, two days before we checked out. When we did check out we were asked to pay again (lucky we had checked our accounts otherwise we would have paid twice).

We had an excellent stay. The location is perfect. It's a 5 minute walk to Saint Germain and the Odeon Metro. It's also an easy walk to the Saint Michel Metro, which we took to Versailles. There are countless cafes and restaurants close by to have breakfast if you choose not to eat at the hotel (which we didn't). There's also a Carrefour (grocery store) on St. Germain to pickup wine, snacks, whatever. It's about a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame and not much longer to the Louvre. We couldn't have been happier with the location. Tons of shopping (mainly clothes and accessories) if you'd like. The hotel is small but well maintained. Be forewarned, the rooms are VERY small. We had expected that but were still a little taken aback when we first stepped inside. It took some careful maneuvering and compromises to get around for a week. However, we spent very little time in the hotel room and once we adapted, we were fine with it. This is really a personal preference -- the rooms are quite small by American standards and I can see how it could be bothersome to some people, but if you're not spending much time in the room, it may not be an issue. The bathroom was small but modern with a separate room for the toilet. Rooms were clean and there's a small minibar should you not feel like going out for a drink, water, etc. It was a little noisy -- we had the windows open due to the unseasonably warm weather (in the high 60's / low 70's, in March) and there is a fair amount of nighttime noise, especially Friday and Saturday. I believe it's fine with the windows closed, but we couldn't get the AC to come on (it probably wasn't turned on yet -- who expects to need it in March!) so it got a little loud at times. The front desk staff was what really made this hotel stand out for us. Thomas, the person we worked with the most, was superbly kind and helpful. He made all of our dinner reservations for us, helped us with recommendations, and provided us with all the directions and information we needed. He was wonderful and really made the stay a pleasure. Constantin, who I believe is the director, was the other person we worked with frequently, and he too was continually helpful and friendly. We highly recommend Aux Charpentiers for dinner. It's just around the corner and we ate there twice. It's fairly inexpensive and not fancy but had excellent food and service. Marie was our waitress both times and she was warm and talkative (even with my horrible French...she went out of her way to talk to us in English). All in all, it was a great stay. We would stay there again without hesitation.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas, USA", "Title": "\u201cLeft Bank hotel\u201d", "Author": "cam330", "ReviewID": "UR126830142", "Content": "This hotel was a nice boutique hotel - very small rooms with a modern bright bath.

Also about 5 minutes to the closet metro stop. The room was small, but large enough for both of us to be in comfortably with luggage. The bed was comfy and the shower pressure good.
