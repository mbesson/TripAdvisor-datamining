Located in a business park, our room was on the back side and we couldn't believe how quiet it was. It featured everything we needed: a kitchen, plenty of closet space, spacious bathroom, a comfortable bed and more. Room comes with a DVD player and we took advantage of this perk by renting two movies for free from their library. The place was very clean and the staff friendly. Two computers available near the main lobby for Internet use. Easy to get to Indianapolis and back. Many restaurants within 5 to 10 minutes. I would recommend this hotel whether you are a business traveler, couple or a family.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fuquay Varina, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cA pleasure to stay there!\u201d", "Author": "TravelingCass", "ReviewID": "UR119936760", "Content": "What a wonderful hotel this is. The one bedroom suite was perfect with a comfortable king size bed and lots of closet space to allow you to settle in during your stay. The full size refridgerator was a bonus and having a the kitchen area was very convenient.

Fabulous value! We booked through Expedia and paid less than $75 per night (before taxes). New hotel. Very comfy bed and room is nicely appointed with reclining lounger and flat screen with satellite and DVD player (especially for the price\u2026.did I mention the price?) We wanted somewhere with a kitchen(ette) for breakfast and afternoon snacks and this suited our requirements perfectly \u2013 full size fridge, microwave, two burner stove, coffee maker, toaster. Close to the highway, and near to restaurants/fast food outlets, gas stations and a supermarket for provisions. We used the pool, the business center and the well-stocked \"honour system\" pantry shop for late night snacks. There is also a fitness centre and outdoor BBQ. Didn't have maid service, but who needs it for three nights? They provide if you stay one week but offered to exchange towels if we had needed to. A/C, temperature control in room so-so but it could have been more a function of trying to manage in 90+ temps outside? The free in-room wifi was slow, but there's the business centre with hardwire access and a printer. Great desk service. We had to move on the last night due a \u201cfunny noise\u201d in our room \u2013 appears there was a water leak in the room above and they were drying out with high power fans which we could hear below. No problem \u2013 they moved us to another room and offered a discount which we could not take advantage of because we had pre-paid.

The suite we had was beautiful, everything was spotless! The staff were very friendly and the onsite grocery store was fully stocked. Big comfy beds, nice pool, and hot tub! The only thing I saw wrong with the entire building was in the poolhouse, one of the light bulbs had caught fire a few weeks earlier so you could tell they were making repairs in that area. Also, the bathtubs seem to be a bit narrow, but I have a big tub at home so this could just be a matter of prefrence. Besides that, the rest of the building was in mint condition! It's right off the expressway and there are resturants literally 1 minute away from the parking lot! It's located in a very quite and seemingly safe industrial park area with lots of businesses and other hotels around it.
