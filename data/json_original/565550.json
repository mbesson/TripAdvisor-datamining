We spent 3 short nights in a 3-bedroom villa (R2) and it was everything we could hope for.

This is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a place to relax and enjoy a quiet vacation in PR. Cooking for our family of 5 was easy, with a grocery store a short drive away. There are a couple of restaurants walking distance, along with horseback riding even closer (we went to all 3). The staff was friendly and helpful - even for us short-notice vacationers. There was wi-fi for my ipad addicted sons - but even they could not resist the snorkeling in Blue Hole and reading on the deck, overlooking the beach. Our unit was very clean and everything was new.

It was exactly if not even better than we had expected. We stayed in F1 which is a gorgeous & comfortable apt. It was myself, husband & 3 teenage boys and where on a mission to surf & relax. Everyone enjoyed taking the time to snorkel & walks on the beach & around the neighborhood especially to Ola Lola's.(.A must along with their infamous peanut butter burger. Great host & staff there too!!) Each morning we enjoy our coffee on the porch & would receive our daily surf report from Mike & guide us to our destination. If you want to know where the surf is he is the man!!! Him & Val are awesome host in their beautiful villa. Trevor & staff are extremely helpful & accommodated with any request needed..if your coming from the states bring a pack of American Spirits Cigs for Trevor..he will greatly appreciate the gesture !! The view is breathtaking, we felt very safe & slept each night like a baby. We had 3 different neighbors during our week stay. They all were considerate, pleasant & professionals that were really happy to be at the VT. In regards to a few previous posts I have read I would like to comment on: If you are in need of any cleaning supplies just ask the main office. They were very accommodating in going into their closet & provide us with any of the essentials to keep our unit clean during the week stay. I can totally understand why they would not keep certain cleaning products left in the units as a liability point and since they do cater to families accidents happen especially with small children. Secondly, noise from planes. We were disappointed in hoping to see more military planes!!! We only saw one USAF cargo plane doing some maneuvers once & that plane was not noisy at all. You will see the occasional USCG helicopter flying around but that only sounds like a leaf blower. We enjoyed watching any military plane fly by because we know they are out doing their job or training for that next mission and in PR the USCG is kept very busy!!! Commercial flights are a bit noisy since they do happen in the odd hours but I enjoyed listening to them cause it brought me back to the moment we were going to be landing & the excitement we felt about beginning our vacation. And then I would feel bad for all those who were leaving & wonder if they had a great vacation & felt as sad as we would when we had to leave. Overall, we were very happy we choose the VT for our family time together. It was perfect setting for spending time with each other. Definitely did not want that resort atmosphere just a safe, clean, comfortable place to call home for a week & we got it here!! Thanks VT see you all again one day. Also, if you follow their directions exactly it is easy to get there even in the middle of the night & only took us less than 10 mins to arrive!!!! If you are planning on doing surfing or discovering the island..excellent location!!! we ventured to Old San Juan and into Rincon all within a very reasonable time..Kids hit every surf spot they watched on youtube or read about in the magazine.

The condo was nice enough, the beach area was lovely, and the sound of the water lapping all night long was wonderful. It seems that most of the friendly people we met come there for long stays year after year. Those people probably don't mind that the condo had almost nothing to make our 2 night stay easier. If I made a list of what it didn't have, it would take pages. It is easier to say, there was a small bar of soap, one washcloth, and watered down dish detergent. For someone staying a long time, they might not resent that there wasn't even a coffee filter or broom, but for 2 nights, we just ended up buying enough for breakfast and eating out the rest of the time. Having stayed in dozens of condo rentals, I have never seen any place as bereft of the basics, such as a tea bag or some coffee or kitchen cleanser. We know that people leave things so that there should be no need for someone to buy everything needed to make a meal or keep the place tidy. I wondered what they could have done with all of the things that people must have left, and then I saw the closet used by the cleaning staff. There were enough cleansers to open a small store. I understand health safety issues, I don't understand taking every single usable item from the condo. We stayed in M2 and my understanding was that there was a queen bed.

We are fairly picky about our accommodations and left pleased. We happen to stay in two units while on our week stay in PR due to availability issues. I will share the pros and cons from our perspective. 1) Ocean Blue Bldg. Rear unit with private pool. There was a sense of tranquility in this unit. It is modern and is relatively new construction. There was plenty of room and the unit was clean. It was very quite with adequate off street parking. These are rental units and there was some minor wear and tear. The living room furniture was fresh and there was a nice sized TV. We were there in January and the pool was too cold to use but nice to sit by. There is an outdoor shower for rinsing off after being at the beach. This unit is across the very narrow lane from the beach. The building is surrounded by other buildings but due to the foliage, you don't get that feeling. One thing that I did not like were the door locks. If you keep your doors to the main exit and patio locked, you had to use your key to unlock the door to exit the unit. This is solved by just keeping the key in the door at all times but not convenient when using both doors. I would return to this unit again. 2) Villa Quionnes unit Q3. This unit was completely different from Ocean Blue. It is right on the beach with spectacular views. It is older and needs a good paint job on the interior walls. The kitchen had bearly enough plates and bowls for two people. The mattress is in serious need of replacement. I had to sleep in the twin because the sag of the mattress made it uncomfortable for two people to sleep in the one double bed. Nevertheless, the place was amazing. It has a large shared deck with a hammock and picnic table for each unit. You immediately become in awe of the views and both my husband and I would find ourselves standing out on the deck just staring at the water. The noise of the waves is constant and loud. We really enjoyed watching the kite boarders. There is a hedge and gate between the buildings and the beach so there is a nice sense of separation from public on the beach. The views and proximity to the water outweighed the negatives stated above. I recommend renting a smaller car when staying at this unit. The parking spots won't accommodate SUVs.or large cars easily. This unit is part of a two building mini complex (M & Q buildings). There was a friendly sense of community where there was always a friendly face and plenty of people happy to answer questions. There are picnic tables between the two building and two outdoor showers to rinse off after being at the beach. I would return to this unit. 3) Villa Tropical as a whole. I liked it. I felt a sense of community among strangers with Trevor and Jennifer as the centerpieces. We had all of the privacy we wanted but there was always someone around if you needed anything. Even the cleaning ladies are really nice. The airplane noise is an issue. The first time a plane flew overhead it was in the middle of the night. It woke me from a deep sleep and scared the heck out of me. I got used to it by the end of the trip. It never bothered my husband. The beaches are nice but not good for swimming. The currents in January were very strong. Swimmers must also take care around the reefs which are numerous. The beach sand is clean. The kite boarders are fun to watch and are all over the beach in one section. They are very friendly and polite. The water temp was just fine for swimming. We are New Englanders. While we were there, we lost power for about a half day. The weather was not too hot so other than not having lights this was not too much of a problem. This is typical for this part of PR. I learned that some units have backup generators and some don't. I suggest taking that into account in the peak of summer when choosing a unit. There are plenty of restaurants near by and two that are within walking distance that I know of. I hope this helps.

Also across the way was the horse stable which always has a a few trips daily. It's a short 5 min drive to town and all of the other beaches. So this place has everything you need as far as convenience. Only negative thing is that it's set back away from the main road and somewhat difficult to find if you've never been there before.

We would definitely stay here again and agree with the reviews we found on TripAdvisor. Our baby was only 6 months younger than Jennifer and Trevor's youngest and we related to their retirement plan to Puerto Rico. We were also looking for possible retirement for ourselves to a tropical environment and found ourselves here to start our search. We loved this place and it was true to the reviews we read. If you are looking for more detail, read on. Villa Tropical is what it says, an apartment without everyday cleaning unless you request it. This is what we wanted, to be left alone and have our full kitchen etc. and to take care of ourselves. We absolutely loved our stay and look forward to staying there again. There are plenty of things to see that are only a day trip away including Rincon beach (known as a surfing mecca) with great picturesque views. Also, the wind caves and many other places we didn't have time to see. Staying at Villa Tropical and not going anywhere else is a vacation in itself. The grocery store is not far and you can sit on the deck and watch the ocean all day long and not be bored. Searching for shells and sea glass is a fun bonus experience. You can even rent snorkeling or surfing gear by the day or the stay. We had a big grill on the huge deck that we used almost every day. Our little 22 month old enjoyed the space. We left the doors accessing the deck open most of the time. She absolutely loved being so close to the beach and enjoyed playing with the beach toys provided by Trevor and Jennifer. The beach was so close and so wonderful. There was plenty of snorkeling and beautiful views to see. The reef was plentiful with lots of ocean life that you can get lost in as you follow it through the area. You could walk down the beach to the east and be secluded or walk to the west and visit Villa Montana for some good eats. The sunsets were beautiful and night beach walking was great. I love to take pictures and there was so many shots, I couldn't keep up. We were there during Halloween and Jennifer planned out a trick or treat adventure for all the kids including mine and even let us borrow a little outfit so my girl wouldn't be left out. These people were so family oriented and loved to meet new people and made us feel like a part of their family. We loved this place and the community surrounding this area. Ola Lola is also a place to visit near by with great food and they will welcome you with open arms. The day we left was hard enough leaving the ocean and about one hour after leaving Villa Tropical, I realized I had left my wedding ring in the top drawer of the nightstand, ugh! Trevor and Jennifer mailed it back to us even adding insurance without hesitation and didn't bother to add it to our bill.

The actual swimming beach is a few feet away, there you can swim, see coral, and snorkel. You can rent snorkeling equipment. for I belive, $10. For food both Isabella and Aguadilla have grocery stores, and many restuarants, bakeries, eateries, no shoratage. Around the corner when you are on the main street you can grab \"pastellilos\" which are basically a turnovers, stuffed with shrimp, meat, cheese, etc for $1.25! They are great! You can go further down to Jobos beach and find small bars, and restuarants and get whatever you want. Ocean Front also has a nice open bar where you can get a full meal or appetizers and enjoy the ocean. I want to stress this is not a fancy hotel. This is not your Westin or Four Seasons type of properties. This is more on the condo scenario, and it might seem a bit outdated with the furniture for some people. However, I want to say we couldn't have been happier here. This is absolutely a quiet, pristine, amazing property with views worth a million bucks.

The location is perfect, right on Shacks Beach. Some of our party had stayed here before. Just not in this unit. All other units were booked and from the website and talking to the owner/mgr of Villa Tropical we decided to stay at Casa Session. However, this unit is substandard. Casa Session should be either removed from the property management listing or the staff needs to get real about what Casa Session really is.... and it is NOT as described on the website or by Trevor. When we arrived, we were shocked. There were Big Wheels and two barking dogs in the compound. And it does look like a compound. We could not open the gate without fear of a dog bite. Cujo and his buddy were in attack mode. The unit was nothing like we expected. Cookie, a wonderful lady, offered us another unit for one night while they had the Cujo family move to another location. The ocean front unit called Villa Sol is wonderful. As is Villa Quinones where another couple from our group stayed. After seeing the cramped accommodation of Villa Session, two of our friends elected to go to Villa Montana Beach Resort, which is not part of Villa Tropical, but just a short walk down the beach. The rest of us stayed and paid our penance. Casa Session, the upstairs unit is a hot, stuffy box with a sliver of an ocean view. There is no air in the central living/kitchen area. Even closing all the windows and creating a dark-hot-box while trying to blow A/C from the bedrooms only brought the temperature down to 86 degrees. Not conducive to cooking or relaxing. The patio has a view of barbed-wire, and one sliver of ocean can be seen. The patio is no relief from the heat inside, as it has not much in the way of airflow or light. This unit would make a great surfer crash pad, and only if the rates were cut in half. If you just got out of prison, you'd feel right at home in this unit. The outside bathroom is reminiscent of the movie Cool Hand Luke and the scenes with the box. Only use this bathroom in the early morning. During the day, you risk your life. Night, brings in the creatures. From website: Casa Session is the latest built building managed by Villa Tropical. It is crisp and new inside with fresh paint and new furniture and artwork. Well manicured (NOT) with new furniture (NOT) and paint, (Okay, the paint was fresh; from a can and on the rusty patio furniture. We had green paint on our arms.)

There is a three bedroom upstairs which has ocean-view from the deck, and a two-bedroom on the main level. (You call that a deck? Now, where is the ocean? Oh, past the barbed-wire.) There are laundry facilities in the base of the building and private parking. (Washer/Dryer/Barbecue are all located on the side of the building. Outside. Rusty.) deck does have ocean views and great patio furniture (Great?) with rocker. There are queen-size beds in two of the bedrooms and a full-size in the third.

Even knowing that we were supposed to be looking for a shell, we had trouble locating it....... can't imagine what we would have done it we hadn't run into the employee.... We got to our apartment in the Villa Bajandas to find an empty beer bottle and a broom on the plastic table on the terrace, and my heart sank. Yes, the view is beautiful, but the tile was filthy and the chairs were all piled up and stuck in a corner-- not very inviting. The interior is, to say the least, basic. There was no working light in the 'master bedroom' so we had to feel around to put our things away in the broken down closet. The tiny bathroom has a leaky toilet, but at least there were clean towels and clean sheets on all of the beds. The A/C works, and there are working fans for the living room. The next morning we went to the office to complain and ask to be moved. Unluckily for us, the were all booked (mostly with friends and family of the wedding party) so we were unable to move. The manager did come up and get one light working in our room as well as mop down the terrace. When we asked what we were supposed to use as beach towels (the whole idea of the place, after all...) he told us that they were all out, but I could purchase some at the front desk. Unbelievable. He brought up one towel a bit later as a 'complimentary gift' which we, of course, left. Other friends had similar experiences, including no toilet paper in the bathroom!!!! (and there are no other paper products throughout the apartments..) On a better note, one group had a very nice apartment that was a three bedroom that was decorated quite well and had a nice clean terrace with actual furniture on it. If you want to stay here, ask for the nice three bedroom. I don't know the name. Their place was like a palace compared to the rest.....", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "TurpentineMontreal", "ReviewID": "UR26503874", "Content": "We stayed at Villa Tropical for one week at the end of February. We were a large group (6 adults and 2 toddlers), so we rented one of the three-bedroom condos. There is a full kitchen, all equipped, which was great for money saving! We pretty much cooked all the time since all necessary shops are about 10 minutes (you have to try the fish hangar at Playa Crash Boat, a 15-20 minute drive, where we bought a tuna for $10 and made 7 big steaks out of it!!!). There was a large terrace overlooking the beach, and it's direct beach access with outside showers and lots of free gear you can borrow. By walking on the beach, you very quickly discover you're the only one around, it's quite deserted! Beware however that the during the week we were there, the beach itself was not really swimmable (though we did quite a bit of snorkelling): quite wavy and windy, which explains the popularity of surf kiting there. However, there is a superb beach a 5-minute drive away, well protected from wind and currents (in front of Villas del Mar Hau, which looked pretty run down from the outside, in case you are considering that option). The hosts were very helpful and friendly, the apartment very clean, large rooms with even a jacuzzi, a real pleasure.

They went out of their way for us in so many ways. We are most grateful.

I understand they have there regular clientele of surfers, ect but I cant understand why anyone would come back with so many options in the area. They pulled a bait and switch when we arrived giving us a different apartment than we had reserved and then tried denying it as though I would not figure out that the name of the house and pictures where not the same from what I had selected from the web page or what was sent to me in the rental agreement (with additional pictures email with the agreement. As a result they avoided us at all times, but in the interest of letting sleeping dogs lie and not let it ruin my winter vaca we dealt with it as we had no other options (they were fully booked and I wasn't going to find somewhere else). Trevor and Mike seem to only take care of their regulars as they dont seem to mind burning (no pun intended) a guest or two based on the reviews. I have rented beach houses the past 2 winters in Puerto Rico and have never had a problem and consider myself a low maintenance guy who could sleep on a fence but these guys run a terrible business and made our stay uncomfortably by sticking my wife son and I to sleep on a full bed giving the apartment we rented with a queen to someone else (a regular is my guess based on what I was able to put together). I wont be surprised if someone gets hurt on one of thier properties and I am sure for every satisfied stay there is one bad one. We made the best of it & love PR but it was just one thing after another and it all lead back to poor management and was all unavoidable if they had taken the care to give us the right accommodations, and not provide junk grills and bottles.

My Villas have always been extremely clean, spacious and peaceful. My schedule is usually very full at work and it is always a joy to come back to Villa Tropical. I open the back door, sit on my patio and listen to and watch the ocean lap onto the beach just 50 yards away. This brings a sense of tranquility after an often busy and stressful day at work. The owners, Trevor and Jennifer are very cordial and accommodating. It is not uncommon for one or both to take an early evening walk about to ensure their guests are comfortable and have everything they need. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the personal touch from this family owned operation that is very attractive. The owners also set me up with a great catering service called \"Banquetes Reinamar \"who delivered fabulous breakfast meals directy to my door every morning at 6:45am. It is evident they truly enjoy their guests and treat everyone, including their Staff, with dignity and respect. I highly recommend Villa Tropical to business travelers or vacationers.

My friend invited our family of three over for the afternoon to have a bar-b-cue. We were also considering staying one night, though the rental \"agent\" for the clustered, privately-owned rental units informed us they only offered only two nights. Fine, since my wife had work later the following day, so we opted to merely visit with our friend. As we were we being accompanied by an agent to our friend's \"suite\" the agent made a bazaar comment to me. She said, \"are your still here?\" At first I could not comprehend her meaning. Apparently, you cannot have guests at this \"fine\" establishment-gussied up beach shacks-without management permission first-kind of like asking the teacher permission to use the bathroom. Anyway, she did not politely remind my friend of this policy, or he was unaware of it. After her caustic comment registered in my road-weary brain, I realized I was livid. I did not call her any names, but I did tell her I had no intention of staying that afternoon, night, or forever. Also, I informed her that she was unprofessional, and perhaps a racist, since she is white and my friend is not; I cannot see her making the same comment to the guest of a middle class -white \"American\" family. I felt bad for my friend who has stayed here for years, spending thousand of dollars to be humiliated. The irony is that he is a person of color being insulted by a white, non-Puerto Rican on an island supposedly controlled by brown-skinned people. How ugly. What really upset me was the fact that my twelve-year-old daughter was present. I did give the agent an earful, but she probably deserves more, like being made to change her job description. I later found out that the same person was having \"issues\" with other guests. In a real hotel, she would be fired immediately for such nasty comments. Her intent was, contrary to her flustered after-explanation, really lame. She said it was a \"misunderstanding.\" Alas, I completely understood her intent. We already found another place up the shore for later this summer, and we would never return to this place. Although the beach is really nice, it is riddled with sea urchins, and nasty coral. The blinds did not work properly and I was told the air conditioning unit kept going on and off all night. If I was on the mainland, I would certainly consider a lawsuit for such strange, insulting behavior. Stay away until they change the management. There are plenty of other places to stay in this neck of the woods. One final comment: The owner of a couple of units graciously offered to help us and tried to placate us with kind words.
