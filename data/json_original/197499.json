The funky shower, lighting & furnature that others have mentioned give it the impression of more space. The only way to feel cramped is if you have too much luggage (after dragging too much luggage around Europe, especially up/down metro stairs, we learned from www.onebag.com how to pack for several weeks with just carryon luggage & works fine). Only quirk with the free wireless is that you have to re-register every 6 hours - as a business traveler that would be a pain but since this is a vacation trip its OK). BTW-in room guide says no Voip or peer to peer on the WiFi, can't comment on the peer to peer but we had our Vonage Voip working fine & did a quick test of Skype with no hitches either. \u20ac18 for breakfast is a bit steep but next door at Pomme de Pain, \u20ac6 gets a small coffee, small juice, crossent & yogurt. Room also has a very small fridge but good enough for wine, snacks, juice, milk, cerial from the Monoprix next door. Hotel can also do your laundry but there is a self service laundrymart 50m away (on rue de Monteotte) where for ~\u20ac10 can do 2 loads in under an hour.

The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Arc De Triomphe and the Airfrance bus to CDG airport. It is located in fairly busy array of streets where there are shops and plenty of food places. The hotel itself is very modern in decor, if not a little bit too 'red' in illumination and interior design. The reception were efficient, the lift I found to be a little cramped and this was with just a small hand luggage! The room was gorgeous, clean and spacious. I am easily satisifed but overall it was enough for my one night stay and most importantly it was clean!

We've stayed in Paris many times, so we knew not to expect a lot for our money (even though this is a 4* hotel). We were given a room direcly opposite the lift - I think on the 4th floor. The corridor was really narrow (just wider than one person!) so we thought we might get noise disturbance from the lift doors and people entering/exiting. We returned to reception and asked to switch - no problem. Note: there is only one tiny lift so be prepared to take the stairs or wait a while at 'rush hour.' On entering the room we were pleasantly surprised as to how light and airy it was. The room was overlooking the main street, but we didn't have any noise disturbance and enjoyed the view. The rooms are very modern in decor, with some unusual (optional!) coloured lighting effects. The w.c. was separate, and the bath/sink was next to it, with a frosted glass wall facing into the bedroom - and no door. As other people have said, this might not be ideal for people who are travelling as friends/family. As a married couple this didn't bother us, but on deciding to take a shower we were shocked to find that the bath had no shower screen and one of those ridiculous shower hoses that you have to hold with your hand!! So, it was really difficult to have a good shower and wash your hair, and avoid getting water all over the floor. This was a major design faux-pas in my opinion. The breakfast buffet selection was good, but on arrival there were no 'cleared' tables to sit at. We cleared one ourselves (not really appropriate for a 4* hotel) and then had to wait for one of the serving ladies to bring us plates and cutlery etc. She was clearly over-worked, but remained pleasant and helpful. The reception staff were also pleasant and friendly, which is always a bonus in Paris ;) Location wise, the hotel is very close to a metro line and there were many bistros, bars and restaurants in the area to sample. The area seems quite upmarket, judging by the shops etc. I would recommend this hotel - although I think I would phone first and check whether the bath/shower situation has been resolved first.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDoes the job, reasonable location.\u201d", "Author": "MidgeMouse", "ReviewID": "UR118732247", "Content": "We stayed here for three nights in September.

The staff were accommodating and moved us to the 4th floor which was great. The rooms are average but clean, the beds were comfy, the shower was hot and powerful. There's not much privacy so no use if you are not a couple. The breakfast was just what was required and there was a good selection. We were just down the street from the airport bus stop, Arc de Triomphe, Champs Elysees and we walked back to the hotel from the Eiffel Tower one night also (40 min walk). If you are staying there visit Chez Gabrielle in the next street up, its a lovely little restaurant with great food.

Although the hotel is like a hostel type, and we didn't get the room we wanted, we enjoyed the stay, mainly because of the staff and location. All staff we encountered were really helpful and kind. Inehs at the breakfast (some orgnanic food!!!) lounge, was absolutely wonderful and went above and beyond her call of duty - merci beaucoup, Inehs, vous-etes tres gentille! Lawrence, who manned the front desk, was especially helpful when family visited, Zahra...-all the staff was very kind. To top it all off, this is an environmentally friendly hotel - a real one - not like the big ones that claim to be, in order to cut costs, and in the end forfeit customer comfort in the name of environment (see my reviews on the Toronto hotels I stayed at). I would recommend this hotel to a friend visiting Paris. And I would go again. If you book early (which we didn't) you can get some great deals at this place! it is a safe: 10 min walk to the Arc de Triomphe, 11 min walk to the Champs-Elysees, and if you are up to it, a nice, long 40-60 min walk to the Tower. If not, buses abound. Or the Metro. Taxis too, but expensive. The area, Ternes, is quite a hustle and bustle place, with a weekend market directly across the street, a grocery store, pharmacy, shoe store, some high end retail and restaurants around. Some homeless people (we saw 3.) La Brasserie Lorraine, which Zahra (I hope I'm spelling her name correctly) recommended, had an excellent menu, and the fish we tried was delicious. The mashed potatoes were not so good. We stayed in a superior room that had chromotherapy (does it work? I don't know, but I wanted to keep it on all the time!) but no view. Ask for a higher floor (so it's a bit quieter) facing the street, (the courtyard is the side wall of the next building - not a real courtyard,) or if you can afford it, the suite. La Seine tour was good, and if you have the time, combine it with the Paris by Day tour with a Tower visit (no waiting!!) Overall, a good stay.

The room was wonderful and I especially liked the fact that I had a balcony. This made my brief two night stay in Paris all the more enjoyable. All of the staff were very attentive and helpful in assisting me finding specific museum locations, local fitness centers and dining establishments. On the last day of my trip the elevator did not work and I had to come down 8 flights of stairs with my heavy luggage, needless to say I was very annoyed. However, Aurelie, the Chef de Reception was very apologetic and offered me a complimentary breakfast. In fact, I should also state that Ms. Aurelie Gaujour also checked me in early on August 3, 2010 and helped me find a local fitness center. She is really amazing, very professional, attentive and a real star! In fact I think she is the \"Etoile\" at the Mercure Paris. The internet worked just fine and the bed was comfy. The hotel was within a 2 minute walk from the metro stop a BIG plus in my book. The only thing I do not like about this property is the very strange set up of the bathroom.

If I can design it better than that at home I am sure a hotel designer should do better. Another foible was that you had to enter the door card into a slot just inside the door before the lights worked but there was no light showing you where the card slot was located so you had to keep the door open with an extended leg to get enough light from the corridor to light up the card slot. The room contained two chairs but they were made from leathercloth. The room was rather small but OK.

They just gave me the hotel's address again which didnt really clarify anything for me! Anyway, the hotel is only a 10 min walk from the Porte Maillot drop off point. My very first impresssion was Oh No we are right next to Stringfellows! I have to admit the strip club with like 5 bouncers on the door clouded my first impressions of the hotel especially when we got upstairs to discover no English TV channels but a host of hard porn entertainment (you need an access code to watch!). The next day when we actually got a chance to walk around teh area during the day, i realised that its actually a fab location and not seedy at all! We were a 5 minute walk from the arc de triomphe and the end of the Champs elysees. Its very handy to be right next to a Monoprix also for supplies! Theres a bar just down the road too called Indigo or Indiana or somthing like that...great to go to for Happy Hour between 5 and 8, half price beer and cocktails in a city where beer can be very pricey! Back to the hotel-the location is fab, the decor in the reception area is modern and nice and the hotel rooms are excellent. They are just like they look on the hotels website. The rooms are large by Paris standards, certainly larger than any other 3 star hotel ive stayed in the city. They are very modern, lovely large shower, big bed, mood lighting etc etc! There are tea and coffee making facilities too (no milk though!). The one reason Im giving the hotel a 4 and not a 5 is that we booked a weekend package through the hotels website that included a guide book, bottle of water , bed and breakfast and a late checkout until 4. When we arrived, there was no mention of teh package, we were just given keys to our room. I had to specifically ask teh next day. The reception staff werent friendly at all. They told me to take a water from the minibar and said I couldnt have the room until 4, only until 2. That was dissapointing as we had a late flight home and the late checkout was the primary reasonh we booked this hotel. If there is no availability, surely you should be told apologetically upon arrival, instead of having to ask when its part of your deal. Anyway...other than that, nice stay!
