{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location in Mexico City We were in Mexico City for sightseeing and the location of the NH is just perfect. I don't know why everybody seems to recommend the area of Zona Rosa, when I think that the Centro Historico is a much better location. Guess it depends about your nightlife activities, we were rather tired from running around all day, so it's great here. You can walk almost everywhere from here, metro station is just across the main plaza. Staff is very friendly, rooms are not too big but comfortable. Very nice breakfast as well and - very important in a city that big and busy - the hotel is absolutely quiet!", "Date": "Dec 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR259673839", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Manuela69"}, {"Content": "no frills business hotel       buffet breakfast", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR927859945", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "singinggigi"}, {"Content": "Solid central Good central city hotel - clean, comfortable, close to the Zocalo but wasn't bothered by noise.

My husband and I stayed in this hotel in our first visit to Mexico city. The location of the hotel is nice since it is pretty close to the Zocalo. However, there are not many restaurants around. Next time that we go to Mexico city we will stay close to the Reforma Avenue, which is still considered the historical district. We liked the places around Reforma Avenue better than the ones in the Zocalo area. We also felt saver and more comfortable around Reforma avenue. This hotel is a chain that target business travelers therefore it was the standard business hotel. It was nice to have free-internet access though. Overall we had no problems there. It was a fine hotel. The staff was helpful and gave us all the information that we needed. In other reviews people complained of the size of the room and of the restroom - this was not a issue for us at all. We just needed a clean bed and a shower!!! We prefered to be outdoors and enjoy the city all day long. They offer a guided tour that include the Plaza de las 3 Culturas + La Basilica de Guadalupe + the piramides (Teotihuac\u8c29n). It is with a private driver and costs 60 USD per person. However, we decided that we would go only to Teotihuac\u8c29n since we did not have much time there. We took the metro to the Central del Norte and then took the bus to Teotihuac\u8c29n - the bus company is called autobuses Teotihuacan. We ended up spending 4 and 1/2 in the site and this was so cheap! I think that this is the best choice if you do not have much time available. In my opinion Teotihuac\u8c29n is more impressive than any other historical site around Mexico city... with a private driver we would have had about 2 hours to walk around Teotihuacan by ourselves.", "Date": "Jul 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR407150369", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pithula"}, {"Content": "NH Mexico City - In the heart of the Zona Rosa Great location in the Zona Rosa.

You know more or less what to expect from the NH chain, a bit like Starbucks. But I have stayed in better hotels of this chain (NH Puebla, and NH Embajada in Madrid). Maybe they have better rooms here but mine is small, almost claustrophobic. Staff have several times just walked into the room, without knocking. The bathroom: NARROW, you have to close and open doors to go from one half to another. The bath tub as someone pointed out is difficult and dangerous to get out of. They have stuffed a bath tub into a shower space. I would not recommend this for older travellers, getting out of the bath tub is dangerous! Everything else is adequate and decent enough. They charge you about $11 for a day's Wifi internet connection. Also for the ecologically aware: they change sheets and towels every day! There is a note in the bathroom asking you to hang your towel if you do not want it washed: but they change it anyway, even if you ask them not to! I dare say they charge for the Internet so they can pay their water bills.

We paid $69 for one night, a great price for this type of hotel, although it may have been because it was a very slow time over Christmas weekend. As another posted commented, it is a serene and quiet place, a lovely change from the total chaos just steps away from the hotel. The location is perfect and extremely convenient. The hotel is nicely decorated. The room was a bit small, but also nicely decorated with a king-sized bed, desk and chair, TV, air conditioning, bathtub/shower combo and black-out drapes. The rooms are soundproofed which means you hear very little from the street and nothing from the hallways - again, may have been because the hotel seemed to be virtually empty. There is a lovely 5th floor restaurant with an outdoor terrace - we did not eat there but it looked very nice. My complaints are small but annoying. The first room we were given was not clean or ready for guests and reeked of smoke. We had asked for a smoking room but this room smelled like there had been a party of smokers. They changed the room without a problem but gave us a non-smoking room. There was a coffee maker, which I had noticed in the hotel information, but no coffee and only one cup. When we asked for coffee, sugar, etc and another cup, they said they would bring it. When we returned later, we did not find these items and when we asked again, we were told they have no coffee. This struck me as strange - why furnish a room with a coffee maker and advertise this if there is no coffee available? This was a small thing and was probably because there was a Starbucks downstairs attached to the lobby. I also chose the hotel because I wanted a bathtub. It was a very small bathtub and difficult to enter - a small step and strange, moveable half-door was somewhat in the way. But both the shower and bathtub were fine - it appeared to be a rather complex design that didn't exactly work. They had toiletries but we had to ask for extra soap as they provided only one small bar for the sink. They also advertise that newspapers are available in the lobby, but they had none. Other than these minor things. we found the hotel to be high quality and a great price. It served our purposes well - a quiet place, comfortable hotel, conveniently located. I would stay there again and would recommend it over other hotels in the area if you are able to get such a good price and are looking for quiet and peace!", "Date": "Dec 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR574032499", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kitkatgirl"}, {"Content": "nice place, one or two issues The NH Centro Historico is well located, a block away from the Z\u8d38calo, close enough to be near, but on a quiet street. The hotel is new (or recently refurbished) and has a pleasant business hotel ambiance. The room is pleasant, decorated in the modern fashion with lots of lights for show and mutiple light switches. My room looked out on a courtyard, little more than a lightwell really, but this was quiet. There was a large TV with several movie channels in English, CNN and a variety of local stations in Spanish. The free wireless access is an appealing feature and this worked fine for me. A few things spoiled the high standards set by the room decor. The bath/shower was surrounded by a thick wall which made getting in and out unecessarily difficult. You had to put your key card in a holder by the door to operate the room electrics, however the clock had no backup battery, and so lost its settings each time you went out of the room! There was a coffee maker in the room, with one coffee pack when I arrived, however although I stayed for a week this was not replaced. The buffet breakfast was fair, but smoking is allowed in the sections right beside where the food is served. On one day when I ordered a room service breakfast, via the card you hang on the door, it arrived 45 minutes late! When I called room service and asked if the person spoke English the phone was left down with a grunt and nobody returned to it, nor was I transferred to the front desk where the friendly staff do speak excellent English ( I then called them myself). The NH Centro Historico is in a fine building and has the potential to be very good but they need to look at some of the details.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR860856585", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gaelflyer"}, {"Content": "Stylish, Comfortable, Convenient The NH Centro Historico is new and stylishly decorated.

The views are not particularly inspiring; half the rooms face a very drab courtyard, and the other half look out onto a 1970's-era bank. The other down-side is that the centro historico area, while very lively during the day, can be a ghost town at night.
