Small hotel, on third floor (fourth to Americans) with a very small elevator access.

Hotel is completely on the third floor. Reception desk, rooms, everything. Hotel arranged for a driver to pick us up at the Fiumicino Airport and to take us back. This worked great and was reasonable, 40 euro each way. I forget to get receipts for these two drivers, but I wrote the hotel after I got home and they got me the recieipts I needed. Great Service! To American sensibilities, the room we had (a double) was small, with a Queen size bed and a twin bed at the foot of the main bed. No chairs to sit on to relax, but we only were in the room to sleep, as we were out seeing the sights for 16 hours a day. These roooms are for sleeping, not to \"live-in\" for long term. We had a private bath in our room. It was small, with only a shower, no tub. Our room was quiet and opened up on the front of the building. The air conditioning was on and worked well, so with the windows closed, no street noise bothered us. Windows did open up and were opened during the day, as the power to the room shuts down with no one in the room. The hotel is in a neighborhood, so not much nightlife here. A few restaurants are near the hotel, but much more commerce, shopping, etc. is about 6 blocks away toward the Vatican. Access to the Metro is just a short walk to the Octaviano Station.

The hotel is located on what is mainly a residential street (though there are shops and businesses too) about 10-15 mins walk from the Vatican. It's fair to say that it's on the outskirts of the city - any further out and you're completely out of tourist territory. That said, it made the area around the hotel pretty quiet, and you're only 5 mins walk away from the nearest Metro station (Ottaviano), which takes you right into the city. If you want to walk into the city, which we did several times, it's more like half an hour. The hotel itself is quite similar to one we stayed in a few years ago in Florence and is probably pretty typical of lots of Italian cities. It was originally a series of apartments and is located on the third floor - thankfully, there is a (very small) lift! The room we had was basic but fine, and certainly clean. We went for an en suite room, which had a very good shower. A couple of small negatives - there wasn't much in the way of wardrobe/drawer storage (we had one small cupboard for both of us) and the bed was a lot firmer than I'm used to, although I must admit it didn't stop me sleeping. In terms of amenities, the free wi-fi was great, as my husband had his laptop and we could look up how to get around. We also used it to make an advance booking for the Vatican Museums, the queue for which is usually horrendous. For those without laptops, the hotel also had its own computer for guests to check emaisl, etc. The room had a TV and DVD player, which were a bit old but workable. We took some DVDs with us because Italian TV is notoriously awful - not that you need to spend evenings watching DVDs in a city like Rome! The hotel's staff were very friendly (usually just one person working there at a time, it seemed), and booked us tickets for the Villa Borghese (well worth a visit) when we asked - though they did take some convincing that it was open on a Sunday! The hotel doesn't do breakfast, but there was access to tea, coffee and mineral water at all times. The first few days we had breakfast in a very nice neighbourhood cafe across the road, frequented mostly by locals; a cappuccino or orange juice and a pastry was 2euro. There is also a 24-hour bakery around the corner from the hotel, which does amazing cakes and pastries! In terms of restaurants, Angelo's is just over the road from the hotel, which we didn't go to but seems to have a very good reputation.

We paid 80 euros a night and for the 80 euros we could have booked last minute into a 4* hotel, but none of the 4* hotel reviews were as good as the San Pietrino and were so glad we went with the guide and stayed in the San Pietrino, this hotel is only a 2* because it does not offer a food service, but right out the door are plenty of places for breakfast, lunch and dinner, I have stayed in 4* hotels not as nice as this! The hotel is well located, Rome is pretty big so no hotel is on top of all the sights, but from this hotel we could get to all the tourist sights easy either on foot by train or the bus! The vatican city/St Peters is less than a 5 minute walk away. Although the train station is a 2 minute walk away and easy to use, we chose most days and evenings to get the bus, nothing is more that a 10 minute bus ride and you get to see much more. The hotel owner was great, he couldnt have done more to make our stay easy, he gave us all our directions, bus numbers, where the bus stops where to get it back etc he gave us resturant reccomendations and if we needed something ie toothpaste, hairdryer we got them in seconds! He even went out and bought a wonderful bunch of flowers which were delivered to our room, as a request from my boyfriend for my birthday! The rooms are immuclate and really cute, and made up every day, with air con, tv, dvd, really comfy beds lovely powerful hot showers etc, oh and free internet, you cant fault the rooms in fact I cant fault this hotel its location or Rome at all! If I was returning to rome I would not even consider booking something else! I would recomended this hotel to anyone going to Rome and I have friends from Australia are staying there next month! Oh one thing if your sightseeing make sure you buy a 20euro pack from the tourist information at the airport or one of them in the city, which gets you into the coloseum and saint peters and another castle which I cant remember the name of plus loads of museums along with 3 full days of free transport, buses and trains, definately MUCH cheaper than doing these things separate!!

The hotel is situated close to the Ottaviano metro station, which is situated on Line A of the metro (around 5 stops from Termini station). It takes approximately 30 minutes to travel to the Coloseum from the hotel by metro and walking. Where the hotel scores highly is its proximity to St Peter's Square, being at most a ten minute walk. It is even closer to the Sistine Chapel, only five minutes away which is very useful if you want to beat the crowds (we arrived at 8.45am and only queued for 30 minutes).

Generally, not a long journey, but you won't have an opportunity to drop in for a shower or half an hour relax between the two sigtseeing/ shopping tours. Secondly, no breakfast is served and that was a problem, since you have to reserve some morning time to find the place to have your morning coffee (although the coffee in italian cafe's is much better than the one in the hotels), but still you need extra time and the worst of all: italians have there coffee standing and there may be even no seats (and if there are, you have to pay three times more for the same when seated). Thirdly, the hotel is not a hotel in the usual sense: it is an apartment in a residential building, refurnished into several separate rooms, and there is no hotel sign elsewhere, except for the one, which is very small, on the entrance door of the building side by side with the names of the other lodgers. So in spite of the map on the web-site we hardly found it. And the last remark. Towels (including bath-towels) were very thin and got soaked very quickly. The rest was quite nice (hospitality, linen, cleanness). For all these the price was not low - 105 Euros for a double with bathroom. Just for comparison: we paid the same price for the same type room in Venice (where we went after Rome), the hotel was located 5 min from San Marco (i.e. right in the center) and bathroom was much better equipped and towels were real Turkish.
