{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Absolutely Awful This hotel was an absolute disgrace. We checked in, were taken to the room which was padlocked (probably because the door didn't close properly) and were gobsmacked at what we saw. There were about 10 flies sitting on the bed to greet us, and heaps of mosquitoes. Looking around for a bathroom and found it was actually outside the back door of the villa. It was open air, and just awful. Imagine showering along with all the mosquitoes. The back door did not have a lock on it either and to me felt very unsafe. The front door lock was bad enough and really anyone could had entered the room. It was miles from anywhere. I would never tell anyone to go to that hotel and have advised my travel agent that they should be taking it out of their brochure. Complete disgrace. Needless to say we checked out 6 hours later after having to pay a fortune for another hotel for 6 nights.KD  KG - Perth, WA", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR208905845", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "karenkevo"}, {"Content": "Value for money Used to be better when I first came to Bali 3 years ago. It is getting old but still quite cheap  value for money. Breakfast is acceptable. Go to Bebek Bali across the road for heavenly local balinese meal - they don't just serve duck. Lots of construction going on around it - as happening in most part of Bali anyway. The hot shower in our room didn't work but they are quick to fix it in the morning.http://www.baliayuhotel.com/", "Date": "Sep 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR346764422", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Reisekater"}, {"Content": "Out of the way We stayed here in June 2008. It is out of the way and doesn't look much from the road but it was well worth the stay. The basic rooms didn't look much so i would advise you to up grade, but for a little extra you can have a 2 bedroom pool villa, which we did and it was terrific.For not much at all we had our own private villa and pool with dining area, kitchen and a little lounge room upstairs with the second bedroom and en suite. it was very clean.The staff are lovely. It has 2 resaurants. the downstairs one I would consider 4 -5 star. The steak is terrific. We had most of our meals here as it was cheap, safe and very nice. The staff were just terrific. Upstairs was not so great but OK.You are about 15min walk to the beach and not a terrific part of the beach but the good thing is your not hounded by hawkers.It took about 15 mins to get into the heart of Kuta and it cost 50,000Rp.

It was my 1st stay at this hotel, and I had a standard Vila for $25 USD a night and because I stayed more than 3 nites I was provided free airport - hotel - airport transfer.Large basic room, comfortable beds, decent TV, balcony (no real view). Staff were always friendly and helpful. Breakfast was basic but tasty. The hotel provides a free shuttle service to Kuta, tho it leaves at 1030 which i found to b a bit early.Tried the spa at the back of the hotel. Staff were quite experienced. Had a foot massage and facial at prices similar to outside the hotel. Only issue was the construction work going on at the property next to the hotel intruded on the relaxed atmosphere.The area around the hotel is very quiet. There's a good range of cheap places to eat near the hotel (1 USD got me a meal and drink), as well as venues more targeted to tourists (with a much higher price tag). I found it quite easy to spend a day in and around the hotel and have everything i needed.Was a very relaxing and enjoyable stay. Definitely consider staying at the hotel again when I;m next in Bali", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR851758807", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sydboy07"}, {"Content": "Not bad at all.... My family stayed at bali Ayu for two weeks in March/April this year (2007). As we are a family of four - 2 adults and 2 kids - we booked a standard villa and a superior villa, requesting that we got these together. (Bali Ayu has a number of these villas that although seperate buildings have a room upstairs and a room downstairs. Each room is accessed by an outside stairwell. Each two storey villa has its own little courtyard with a gated entry which is fine if you are afmily sharing, but if you dont know who has the villa above or below you then you'd have complete strangers passing through your courtyard!)The rooms themselves were fine - tiled floors, indoor/outdoor bathrooms, robe, mirror and the superior villa had a little kitchenette which consisted of a hotplate anf a reasonable sized fridge.The rooms had TV's in them, but we were unable to get any reception at all on these. Apparently they only show indonesian channels anyway!The pool area is lovely - has a little pool bar which is manned some of the time. There was always a shortage of pool towels however and the hotel wasnt even half full! There are about 8 loungers around the pool, so probably good that the hotel wasnt busier.The spa Puspa Ayu is fabulous - very reasonable prices and lovely girls, expecially Ayu who was our favourite!Bali Ayu is a fair way out of the action of Kuta/Legian. It did not worry us in the slightest as we didnt want to be near it, but could quite easily walk into it! (Took about 45 mins to 1 hour to walk down to Legian/Kuta). We loved walking past rice paddies and cornfields to get to restaurants rather than market stall after market stall...Bali Ayu now has some proper villas! two and three bedroom villas with private pools...these look very nice and would be a great option for families or groups of friends travelling together", "Date": "Apr 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR696706175", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "stutter"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d594289-r23364672-Bali_Ayu_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "594289", "Price": "$36"}}
