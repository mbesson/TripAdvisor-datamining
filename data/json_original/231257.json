This is quite the possibly, no hang on a minute it is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in in. My lovely new wife also shares my views. We stayed on the 5th floor. No way on earth this hotel is 3 star. Room was very small. A/C was rubbish, like a hamster blowing through a straw. The toilet smelled and the shower also flooded the toilet. The only plus point it did have good views of the Tuscan countryside.If you value your sanity do not visit this place. As the A/C was poor we left the window open....big mistake......I had at least 30 midgie bites all over my body, still have then now, nearly 2 weeks after I visited.

Three of us myself , my sister and her partner. We had booked a single and a double room. The hotel lobby started to send warning signals but up we went to our respective rooms. As soon as I went into the room I had this overwhelming impression of being dirty. The room stank ,the walls looked in need of a good clean and a paint job, I didnt want to even sit on the bed !! I was wondering what to do when my sister came in looking devastated. Her room was as equally appalling. We went to the reception asking for different rooms, inspected two others but found them as equally dismal. We checked out immediately and moved up the road to another hotel. How does Ascot get its 3 star rating there was no way it compared to any of the 3 star hotels we stayed in while in Italy. It resembles more of a Doss house than a 3 star hotel.

We stayed here on our honeymoon, and it was the worst hotel of our whole trip. When I book hotels now, I think of this place and hope and pray that it is not like this place. Because of this place, I spend hours searching for hotels, reading reviews and convince my husband we should spend a little more on the hotel. When we first booked our accommodation, I hadn't discovered Trip Advisor - I wish I had.I don't think I am fussy when it come to hotels, I am happy with a small bathroom, singles beds, basic breakfast, a bit of noise, just give me a clean and comfortable hotel.The SMELL in this place was HORRENDOUS. The bathroom stank of sewerage, I put a towel and chair over the drain to try and stop the smell, but it still stank out the room. We bought a can of air freshener, but it didn't help for long. We had a smoking room, and my husband hates me smoking, but he let me smoke in the room to help mask that smell.The bed was so uncomfortable, sagging and springs sticking out like it was decades old. The decor was old, stained and peeling, the floor was vinyl.The staff were rude, abrupt and unhelpful.When I think of Florence, I now think of this place which is sad, as I really enjoyed the rest of Florence.", "Date": "Oct 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR627730644", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "vegiemite6"}, {"Content": "The people who liked this place are crazy We read the bad reviews too late, but figured it was just people being snobby.

The rooms are small, the shower flooded the bathroom every time you used it and the air conditioning unit is a theory at best. The staff lost our reservations, so that was a good 15 minutes of panicking as well.And when we were checking out, their Visa machine wouldn't take either of our Three credit cards. The manager thoughtfully suggested that we must have just overspent on our limits and told us to go get some cash from the machine up the street. When I told her the limit on the cards were quite significant, she just rolled her eyes.After confirming the cards worked just fine (all three of them) we went back and told them. Still no luck.

TV hanging off the wall over the bed and held in place with a chain. Electrical wires coming out of the wall(not sure if they were live or not, didn't hang around long enough to find out). The shower in the bathroom had no base so water just flies all over the place, just a hole in the floor! We went downstairs and said we wanted to be moved in a polite manner.

The beds were comfortable, linen clean however the furniture and the decor was a little tired but for all the time we were in the room it didn't bother us.We had no nasty smells from our bathroom and the shower which did spray over everything else in the room was powerful and there was plenty of hot water.

Had 2 rooms booked - 1 for my sister and I, the other for my parents.If I had the cash to be able to 're-home' all of us, I definitely would have. Reception - uninviting and serviced by people who showed little or no interest - e.g. requested a light bulb for the toilet / shower - there was no other light - was told it would happen the next day as they had no bulbs - it was never done.The rooms - miserable  dark. Paint chipped, tile floors - lacked comfort and very uninviting - the blue bed spreads were not clean.The bathroom - tiny - toilet come shower. The toilet dripped throughout the night.Breakfast - forget it - I didn't bother after the first morning - cardboard croissants / no taste rubber cheese / ham - coupled with busy hot room. Air Con - didn't work - you had to leave the windows open at night as it was so hot in the room. Got bitten several times (I am hoping from something flying around NOT something in the bed!)Location - On a busy road down from the main station - feel like I haven't slept for 4 nights as it was so loud.I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for - this was not a hugely expensive hotel, but the 3* grading was completely misleading. If this is a 3* standard in Florence then travellers need to be aware that it is not what the English would grade as 3* - I would definitely have looked for a 4* had I known !Not only did I not sleep at night, but there was also nowhere comfortable to relax and re-charge - you felt that you wanted to get out of the hotel as quickly as possible.Have left feeling very sad for my parents as this is their 1 holiday a year and it wasn't at all relaxing.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR966748755", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "LondonFlorence"}, {"Content": "Don't stay here A terrible hotel in a generally poor state of upkeep and repair.

The floor was not carpeted and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. The bathroom had a drain in the middle of the floor, with the toilet/bidet on one side and the sink on the other side. The shower curtain didn't reach all the way around the room so we either had a wet toilet or a wet sink after taking a shower. Water from the bathroom would seep under the door into the bedroom when we would take a shower (which could explain why there are no carpets). We had to keep the bathroom door closed at all times because it smelled like a public restroom. The second day we were there, the hotel staff were finally able to locate our reservations but by then we had already found a room at a different hotel because we were afraid that they had lost our reservation. They did not charge us for cancelling our room less than 24 hours in advance, but that was the least they could do considering that they weren't competent enough to locate our reservation in the first place.

The beds were awful - almost like two camp beds pushed together with the springs jutting out. The room smelt of rotten eggs and was humid despite the air-conditioning.

It was on the mattress bad, but it was visible through the white fitted sheet. Regardless, we refused to sleep on that bed. The second bed sagged terribly in the middle. The third bed broke when my brother laid on it because it was missing half of the wooden slats on the bed frame (the remaining ones had been angled, but as soon as any weight was put on the bed they fell out). We ended up putting the mattress on the floor for the night. The air conditioning that was advertised did not work. We played around with it and it made noise, but there was no cold air. There were dead bugs on the walls. The floor was dirty- I took off my socks and shoes to cool down and the bottom of my feet were filthy from walking around the room. There was no shower curtain in the bathroom (basically there was a toilet, sink and shower head with a drain in the floor), so we had to take everything out to avoid making a huge mess.

How this hotel ever got a 3 star rating is beyond me. The hotel is not worth the price at all- I'm sure there's something nicer in Florence for this kind of money. It really ruined our day there. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "Aug 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR160182730", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Lorrxa99"}, {"Content": "Lousy In an attempt to get away from another nasty Florence \u9225\u6e08uest house\u9225? we found this hotel at a moment's notice.

We stayed in this hotel on Nov 28-29, 2003. When we came in the afternoon they said our room will be ready in the evening and therefore we should come back later. However, when we came back late night we were told that the room we were supposed to stay in, was having some water leak problems. To be fair, they did offer a choice to us to move to a different hotel which was 20 minutes away. Since we were too tired, we settled for staying in Ascot itself, provided they move us to a different room the next day.. t was a bad decision to stay there. The carpet was wet and the bathroom outlet was clogged and the room was stinking. There was no way that problem must have happened that day. It must be a permanent issue with that room and we were mad that why did they not tell us in the afternoon that the room was seedy. Throughout the night, the doors of other rooms kept banging and there seemed to be no soundproofing. The stink coupled with the noises did not allow us to sleep and left us cursing. The room we stayed in the next day was better and probably was their best room (we were shown a few other rooms and they also seemed to have a stink).

My wife and I, with a group of four friends who had recently retired, decided to enjoy the delights of Italy and planned a visit to Florence between the 8th and the 15th of October 2003. The hotel we happened to choose, was the Ascot Hotel. We pre-paid for six nights and were looking forward to enjoy the relative comforts of a three star hotel. Whilst the hotel is conveniently situated near the Santa Maria Novella railway station and lots of other attractions, our misgivings started on arrival. We arrived about lunchtime and were graciously offered to make use of one of our allocated rooms to store our luggage and refresh ourselves. There was a small lift to room 201 and before entering we noticed a rather rank smell in the reception area, which seems to originate from the sewers of the town. The corridors had wallpaper peeling off the walls, but whilst the bedroom was adequately sized for a double, it was shabby, carpet was threadbare, bedside light was not working and a number of slats were lying under the bed instead of supporting the mattress centre. The outlook was to a dismal backyard with broken railings, however we did not intend to spend a lot of our precious time in the bedroom or the hotel. On entering the small bathroom I observed shelves just loosely hanging from the mouldy, grimy tiles, a cracked hand wash basin, a shower hose with no shower rose and a centre drain with a broken metal grid. Our first purchases in Florence were at the chemist for bleach, disinfectant, air-freshener and mosquito spray. Being in high spirits, we then looked at some of the delightful attraction in the vicinity and planned our week ahead before retiring to our rooms and discovering a handful of cockroaches. The following morning we made our way to the breakfast room and found nothing! No clean tables, no crockery, no cutlery, no glasses, no bread, no juices, no coffeeetc, etc..absolutely pron nulla! The one member of staff on duty was one woman who seemed to be overwhelmed by our requests for anything. Her reply due minuto was an automatic response followed by her departure into the background and her eventual reappearance with a couple of hot glasses (for 6!) straight from the dishwasher for juice or some other single item of food. We began to feel sorry for her and the apparent shortage of equipment she had to deal with, we decided to have our breakfast earlier the following day to avoid the rush hour. However, we found nothing had changed and we had a repeat performance from the previous day, only to be told when requesting utensils or food cinque minuto and to sitta downe. We decided to mention the shortcomings at the reception desk and found the three following mornings a plethora of equipment and glut of food available as well as two members of staff working and were quite pleased with ourselves for having resolved the problema. It was however a short-lived gratification, the last day of our stay was a repeat performance of the first couple of days and our complaints to the receptionist on duty resulted in a confrontational row with a hostile breakfast waitress. On the second day the lift also ceased to function and was only repaired by the evening of our 6th and last night. At no time did a representative of the management approach us and we decided to write to them instead and also contact the Florence tourist board to enable them to review their rating system.If this hotel had been in the UK, I would take them to court.Would we recommend the Ascot Hotel? Decidedly: NO!!!S.H.F.

All the printed and website information says that the hotel has been recently rennovated but it certainly does not look like it has. It was very hot in Florence in July when I was there and one of the reasons I chose the hotel was because it had airconditioning. The airconditioner in the room made a lot of noise but no cold air came out of it. The entire hotel was hot! After a day of walking in the heat it would have been nice to take a cold shower but even the water was hot. The bathroom was not nice at all and had a moldy smell to it. The carpet in the room looked like it had not been vaccumed in a while. The breakfast was standard and the staff were nice but did not seem like they really had the ability to do much. I'm sure there are other hotels in the city that offer comparable prices with better ammenities.
