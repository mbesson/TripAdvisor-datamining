Unfortunately, Hotel de L'Elysee was not part of the \"wonderful\" equation.

I read all the reviews on Tripadvisor carefully, so it seemed to fit. I always use the tripadvisor reviews before booking a hotel, and have never been disapointed. Once I arrived I did have help from one gentleman who helped bring my luggage up the stairs. I asked him if there was and breakfast and he said no. That was fine with me, but I did think it odd, as it was mentioned in the other reviews that they provided a small breakfast. Once I got back in from my meetings, I was looking forward to sleeping, as I had an early and busy day the next day. At 2.30 AM in the morning, I woke up absolutely freezing. The weather was about -22 degrees outside, and it felt that cold inside also. I went to call downstairs to see what was happening, and I realized that my room had no electricity! So, I got up out of bed, went downstairs. While I was going down, I realized that the two floors below me were heated! Once I arrived to the main level, there man behind the counter who proceeded to tell me that the electricity was now put on again. What? Why did he turn off the electricity on my floor? How unbelievable is that? It took forever for the room to heat up. It also took me over an hour to fall asleep, this time fully dressed with my pyjamas, and my sweater on and jacket on top of the two bed sheets provided. The next morning, I didn't even get an apology from the same man who was there at 2.30 AM or was asked how my stay was. I am polite, flexible and don't have a chip on my shoulder.

Place was a bit shabbier/plainer than we expected from the reviews but overall room cleanliness was very good for the price. Unfortunately construction going on across and up the street awakened us at 7AM with very loud digging equipment, saws, etc., but that's not the hotel's fault. The surly attitude by the morning front desk person makes me give this place a resounding negative. First, he knocked on our door to inform us that check out time was 11AM--as if we had overstayed, when in fact it was 10 minutes before 11 and we were preparing to leave. Then, he yelled at us for using an upstairs exit door and stairway to bring down a large suitcase. The desk person the day before had allowed us to use this more convenient and less narrow/twisty staircase when we checked in and we assumed it was ok to take the same route for our departure. (The indoor stairway is very narrow and winding and I feared that I'd scrape the walls with my suitcase if I had to bring it up & down that way.) I apologized and tried to explain to him that we had been given permission by the gentleman working the desk the day before, but he just repeated that we were \"never\" to use that exit and that he didn't care what we'd been told.
