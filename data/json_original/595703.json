{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice location, lousy service The location is perfect if you wanna dive the wreck. It's just 100 m from the wreck. Diving service is ok, staff are professional and eco friendly. The reservation staff is prompt and responsive.Now the downfall: the hotel service is lousy. There's nobody to welcome us at the reception despite two receptionist girls were sitting there and saw us coming. The annoying thing is the room doesn't have telephone so you have to go down to the front office (if there's somebody there at all) if you need something or just want to ask something. They charge EUR 5 per hour for internet connection in the room if you bring laptop. The room itself is quite nicely decorated and has view overlooking the ocean with nice terrace. Toilet is rather stinky though. The bed is squeaking pretty badly in our room. Food is not too bad even some are overpriced. Two small pieces of fried banana is $3.5!!! There were many flies too in the restaurant. Well if your main purpose is for diving, this resort is more than enough.", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR300077212", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "natnaw"}, {"Content": "The best place for relaxing diving in Bali We stayed for 14 nights at this wonderful resort. We loved everything about it and would recommend it to anyone wanting to dive in Bali. It is directly at the beach with beautiful views on the Mount Agung and the sea, especially when having lunch upstairs in the open restaurant. The food they serve is very delicious, no matter if you have Indonesian, Balinese or Western food. And the breakfast served as several menus is the best we ever had all over Bali. The rooms themselves are very comfortable, plenty of space and great facilities (air condition, comfortable sitting areas plus lazy beds, mini bar\u9225?. The whole area is very beautiful and exquisitely maintained and you can enjoy a sun bed without getting disturbed from other guests or even beach sellers. The village is quiet so you do not find a lot of night life there, but you have a very nice Beach and Pool Bar in the resort where they serve delicious cocktails - place to be, especially at Happy Hour Time! The service is excellent, in the restaurant, dive base and everywhere else. And the diving is amazing , not only the popular Wreck (but we had unforgettable night dives there), also the beautiful Coral Garden and the Drop Off. Bali is a great place to be and Tauch Terminal Tulamben is a must for all divers!!", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR467625180", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KarlaKarlsruhe123456"}, {"Content": "They can change your reservation without a notice. We just returned from an 8-day trip on Bali. One of the nights we stayed in Tulamben at Tauch Terminal resort. I booked a specific room there a few months in advance. The room I choose was actually a suite with two rooms and a sea view. Both factors were very important to us because we were traveling with our 12-year old daughter, and because we were told by our friends of the beautiful sunrise there as the hotel is right at the beach facing east.However, to our great surprise and disappointment, when we checked in, we realized that we got a different, less expensive room. It was just a single room with an extra bed for our daughter, facing the back wall of a utility building. We brought this to the management\u9225\u6a9a attention. The General Manager by the name Mark, a very pleasant person, came to apologize. However, he apologized not for changing our reservation, but only for the fact that they did not inform us about it. He said that it is normal to make such changes. In addition to the apology he offered us an additional room (i.e., the same as the one we got) for free. We declined since that room would have had the same less than exciting view. Then, Mark offered us to pick any wine at the hotel's restaurant for free, which we accepted (the most expensive wine on the list was about US$30).There was no point in continuing our complaint since the type of room we originally booked was not available, anyway. However, even though Mark tried his best to mitigate the problem, we still felt a little insulted that our reservation was changed without a timely notice. I strongly believe that hotels can not kick their guests around at will. If a hotel confirmed a booking, it should be true to its word, even if later it gets a reservation request from a more profitable or better connected guest. Now, to be fair, I must state the things I liked about Touch Terminal. Its location is unbeatable. The sunrise is truly amazing. My wife and I got out of our dark room to the pool overlooking the sea at 6am, and enjoyed the sunrise. In addition, it is an awesome place for diving and snorkeling. There is a WWII shipwreck right in front of the hotel, and the amount of fish in just a few meters of the beach is amazing. The hotel specializes in serving divers and does a great job at that.The service, in general, is also very good. However, on Bali, great service is a norm.I think, however, that hotel is very overpriced. Its restaurant and spa (particularly the spa) were the most expensive by far of the ones we saw in our 8 days on Bali. The diving and snorkeling equipment rental was rather expensive, as well.", "Date": "Aug 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR670641476", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "grib"}, {"Content": "Good for a short break for divers with a non-diving partner Don't be put off by the location to get to this resort, although it is quite a journey in Balinese terms it is worth it. Rather than take the early morning dive boats from the busier resorts you can stay here and simply dive off the beach when you want. Even prior to arriving at the resort I was impressed with the staff - all my questions via email having been answered promptly. Upon arrival we found friendly and helpful staff. The rooms were large simply furnished, the restaurant served very good food and was very good value. As for the diving it's not the best in the world, but being Advanced PADI meant we were able to simply grab a tank when we wanted to and walk off the beach to dive the Japanese wreck at our leisure which was amazing as it's very shallow and teaming with life. Seeing the local young boys and ladies carrying 2 sets of tanks on their heads back to the dive shop is definitely something not to be missed either. I partook in a spa treatment one evening and was pleasantly surprised - for non-divers this would be a nice way to spend the time and not expensive either.", "Date": "Apr 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR982745090", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Hong Kong Rats"}, {"Content": "Tolle Tauchspots - sch\u679anes Hotel   showReview(8659130, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR993072497", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Ferientechniker"}, {"Content": "Hotel a Tulamben pour plongeur   showReview(5638164, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR514949529", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Margaux75"}, {"Content": "Nichts was man gesehen haben muss   showReview(5602440, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR551967527", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Taucher"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469406-d595703-r23364751-Tauch_Terminal_Tulamben_Resort-Tulamben_Bali.html", "HotelID": "595703", "Price": "$92"}}
