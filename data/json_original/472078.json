We booked our stay through an online travel-booking site and picked a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd deal at a very reduced price; the offer basically consists in knowing the location, number of stars, the facilities and the Tripadvisor rating of the hotel but not its name; not until you pay for it, that is. It worked really well as the hotel was just what we expected and the price was a really good deal. The hotel is a bit far from the train station for a walk, though we did it in about 40 min on the way there, as we love to walk around and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t travel with heavy cases. There is a tram that takes you to the station directly and stops next to the hotel, so transport is not an issue. We chose the location for the museums but found that it was perfect for pretty much anything you might want to do in Amsterdam (although it is technically far from the city centre and the red light district). The Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh museum are 5 min walk away and Vondelpark is only short walk away. The Pijp district is on the other side of the canal and there are plenty of international restaurants, small caf\u00c3\u00a9s and nice bars. We walked to the Flour Market without a problem but took the tram when visiting the Botanical Gardens and the Hermitage Amsterdam museum. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have breakfast included in our stay but were lucky enough to find the fantastic Bagels & Beans caf\u00c3\u00a9 (Ambachtsweg 40 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 42, only 7 min walk away) as soon as we arrived and we ate our breakfast there every day; I cannot recommend it enough! Restaurant wise, do try the superb Ethiopian restaurant Walia Ibex (1e Jacob van Campenstraat, 41-HS; again only 10 min walk from the hotel on the other side of the canal). We had a standard room as far as I can tell and it was a good size, with big and comfortable bed, large bathroom and lovely view of the canal below. We found service to be efficient and reception staff was always happy to help. There is a very cosy sitting area and a bar on the ground floor, level with the reception area, and we enjoyed having few glasses of wine there while using the complimentary wi-fi connection (please note that each login works for 30 min only but you can get as many free login codes as you want from reception).

I departed on the Schiphol Sternet bus #197 to the airport for only 4 Euros. The bus only took 15 minutes and departed in front of the Rijksmuseum every 10 minutes from about 6 am to midnight. The room I had (6th floor, facing the canal) was very quiet and large by European standards but had older, worn furniture, a small closet and a small CRT television with, in English; CNN, the Discovery Channel, Comedy Channel, MTV, National Geographic, BBC and Eurosports. The room had a desk with an Ethernet port, shower with tub, some toiletries (shampoo, shower gel, etc.) central heating and air conditioning, safe, iron and ironing board, hair dryer, mini-ref and blackout curtains that really worked. The bed, in my opinion, was hard with mushy pillows. There was a self-service laundry, fitness center, breakfast (not included with my room so I can't comment on the quality), bar on the ground floor and Internet PC in the lobby available for 15 minutes at a time to check e-mails and print out boarding passes. There was also a luggage storage room for early arrivals or late departures. The hotel is located in the Oud Zuid or Old South section of Amsterdam. This area has the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum as well as the Heineken Experience and the US consulate just around the corner. I found the area to be safe, even late at night and never felt uncomfortable walking back to the hotel at any hour. Amsterdam is a small city so it only takes about 20-30 minutes to walk to the Centraal Station and Dam Square. I've stayed in other hotels in Amsterdam that were more conveniently located but with much smaller and older rooms.

The drawback was the housekeeping. I asked for a change of sheets and pillowcase once when the maid was in the room, and was told \"No, not today. You can have new bedding on Wednesday\" This was on Monday, so I was amazed at the curt answer. The desk staff tried to be helpful when I needed to find a drug store. Unfortunately, the street they directed me to, where they were sure there was a pharmacy, had no such establishment, and I wasted an hour walking about while I was feeling ill and needing some drugs (not the kind Amsterdam is famous for). There is a cute little bar in the hotel, that never seems to be open when anyone wants a drink. Free Wi-Fi only in the lobby, for 30 minute intervals, only with a password, and you have to ask the desk clerk for a new password every 30 minutes. This is a really clumsy approach, and it surprised me. Other NH hotels I have used do a better job with this modern necessity.

From the time we got there until the time we left, it was horrible. When we first arrived, the front receptionist claimed that we cancelled our reservations. Though we were able to book two rooms, they both were not next to each other. One room was double bed and the other was double with an extra twin. When we got to our rooms, both had dirty carpet and the atmosphere was just not what we expected for a 4 star hotel. One of the rooms had a sink with brown burned marks and hair in the sink and on the upper counter above the toilet. Don't expect much from the refrigerator either, its this small tacky thing with nothing in it. If you wanted a drink of water and pay, you'd have to call and order because nothing is there and ready for use. Wifi, dont expect it at all because you can only use it in the lobby and for a duration of 30 minutes unless you're in some \"special group\". I used it late at night and was able to get another passcode from the front desk who was nice enough to give another one. They were late night shifts who were actually nice. On check out day, i woke up to my phone alarm on the bed and forgot it when we checked out. I called back 30 minutes to have them check if they found my phone and they said no. I came back to the hotel in 15 minutes and the front desk brought me up to my room. My room which we gave tip, was wiped clean. The extra twin bed which i had slept on was gone. They called linens to check if my iphone may have been accidentally taken off with the sheets but no luck. I asked to speak to the staff cleaner but it was in their policy to not allow that. I was then directed o speak to their manager who was nice in an evil way. He basically made me feel like crap because he couldn't prove that i was right and so his staff was able to get away with taking my phone. Where I come from, the customer is always right, he just shooed me off and did not offer to take down my information to contact me if it was to be found. Instead, he gave me \"his\" card and said try calling us someday and maybe we'll have it. I was in complete shock that I was at a 4 star hotel and my phone was taken and not returned. I replay my phone on my bed over and over and I just cannot believe the staff cleaner got away with taking my phone. I cannot believe they can claim to accidentally put it in the linens when I know damn well the cleaner had to pick up my pillow and blanket before taking off the sheets. So, i faced it that my phone would be gone forever. The one front desk receptionist (really upset i didn't get down names!), she was kind enough to direct us to the police station to get a report so I could send to my insurance. We went to the police station and not to my surprise, was treated like crap again. The office had a defensive stance with his hands on his waste and talked with an aggressive demanding attitude. He refused to write up a report and kept asking me to give him my registration number of the phone so they could find it. At that point I wasn't even worried about finding it because I already knew it would never be retrieved ever again. His little fairytale world thinks you can just track a phone and get it back when in reality people can wipe out your phone and use it as if it was bought. We went back and forth for 10 minutes and I'm trying to figure out with this douche just cannot write up a simple report. He finally calls out his chief who was actually really nice! he wrote up the report, I kindly thanked him for his help and we headed right back to the hotel. We asked the front desk to confirm our report, she said she could not do that. Her \"colleague\" who is the manager, was only able to do that. She gave us so much attitude and difficulty about getting her \"colleague\" to do it. She then claimed that he and the staff were in a meeting. We got upset and asked when will this meeting be over and we were fussing and all that when eventually the receptionist next to her (the nice one) spoke to her in dutch and we could tell she was like why can't you just go in and get in and she got up and got him immediately. We were in total awe that we were spoken to that way by her, lied to by her, and treated that way at all as a customer. When the manager came out, he tried to give me a hard time about just confirming the report saying he cannot say this and that because it would make them liable. I said, i didn't need him to state much but to confirm our stay at the hotel. After fussing with him for about 5 minutes, he finally wrote it and stapled \"HIS\" card to it which he did not give me in the first place. After all we went through, no phone. One customer was kind enough to ask if I was ok (American) and thats when I felt homesick because America would never treat you like that no matter what hotel you're in.

It's on a quiet canal (not the most beautiful of the city's canals, but a nice one nonetheless), very convenient to to the main art museums, a five-minute walk to streets full of varied restaurants and bars, and a fairly easy stroll into the historic center. Within 10 minutes of the hotel you are walking the historic central canals. We would walk into the center, and then take a tram back. We took the basic room and it was plenty large for a rollaway bed. The rooms are well designed with plenty of closet space, a safe, a dryer, a fridge, and electric kettle. The hotel has a laundermatte, a small but well appointed gym, and icemaking machines on each floor. The bed was comfortable and the litte bit of traffic on the canal never bothered us. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel felt like an American hotel, in good sense of being roomy and full of conveniences. We could have had our room for 120 euros a night if I had paid ahead. Our room came to 135 euros without prepayment. Still, I felt it was good value for such a large room in a city center. The breakfast is a bit pricey at 19 euros a head, but they never charged us for our daughter, and it's such a huge spread of fruit, cereal, eggs, cheeses, and cold cuts that we didn't need lunch. A few complaints: we could never get the supposedly free wi-fi to work (but we didn't try that hard either), and the room service menu is limited, pricey, and not terribly good (it was our first night, our daughter was tired from a full day of travel, and I didn't know how much good takeout there is in the neighborhood).", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kolkata", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel, not so great location\u201d", "Author": "editorindisguise", "ReviewID": "UR83550378", "Content": "If you check the hotel website, it will tell you NH Museum Quarter is located 1 km from the city centre.

The breakfast here is lovely- good selection- pancakes, meats, cheeses, fruits, cereals, eggs, fried breakfast and more. Only complaint is that coffee is from a machine that wasn't always working. They serve breakfast til11 week mornings and til 12 at weekends- great to have this option when you're on holidays. The rooms are very spacious, modern and clean with plenty of wardrobe space. One small complaint about the rooms is the air conditioning/heating vent. Despite turning it off at night it seemed to make a very slight constant noise- as if on a very low level- which can be annoying when you're trying to sleep. Bathrooms are a good size, with a good shower and always plenty of hot water. The hotel was quite busy during our stay- seems to be the hotel of choice for KLM cabin crew which is always a good sign.

Since we arrived late we just used the hotel restaurant, which was a massive joke. The restaurant menu and room service menu is same. Very small selection. The chicken and cheese sandwich i had arrived with melted cheese but it was stone cold. When we went to pay, it took us 20min since the room we were staying in was still under the previous persons name! The breakfast was so so, nothing special. When we checked out we needed to print the online booking tickets.. which they charged us 35 cents per A4 sheet of paper. Gee thanks. Our room was on 3rd floor if that makes any difference. Overall i was very disappointed considering the 4 star rating and the price.

As we were in Amsterdam for the Easter weekend, it was very difficult to find anywhere at all within budget, that wasn't miles away or a hostel. This place seemed cheap, and near enough to walk to the centre - my two main considerations! However, this place was much more than that. We arrived at ten AM, after having been up since 3am. We were fully expecting to be told we had to come back after 2, but were pleasantly surprised to be told that there was a room available. We had booked a smoking room, and we still don't know if what we got was a soming room or not. There were no ash trays, but also no \"no smoking\" signs. We smoked in there and had no problems. One thing - they wanted to take an impression of a credit card, but as we wanted to pay in cash they took a 50 pound deposit instead. This was re imbursed on our last day, and it worked out well because it meant that we didn't have to worry about keeping money aside for the last day. The location is good - really nice bar over the road, and near to nice bars, cafes, etc. I was concerned it was too far from the centre, but I realise now that the centre really isn't all that great, and the areas further out are nicer and less tacky. It took us about 20 mins to walk to Dam square, which was fine, and as near as I would want to be to the place! One thing about the trams- really easy to use and cheap, but we did have trouble getting off at the right place! We never managed to get up in time, and always ended up getting off at the next stop. It wasn't a problem, but it might be worth bearing in mind. It's not a typically touristy stop, so you wont be able to rely on others getting off too. We never ate in the hotel, so I can't comment on that. The bath was lovely, loads of hot water, as was the shower. It was all pretty quiet, even though we were by a lift. I also liked the fact that we got a lovely view of the canal, with nice big windows that opened. Good, as it was hot and sunny! I liked this hotel because we felt like we were free to do as we liked; we never felt that we were being hassled, the room was nice and clean but we never saw the maid, and reception were really helpful if you asked for it. The fridge in the room worked well, the hairdryer was good, and the bed was large and comfy. I would definitely stay again. Only thing I wold change was the toiletries in the bathroom. There was only a small cheap looking shampoo and shower gel.

We booked the hotel through the NH Hotels website. Our 'deal' involved a king size room with canal view and included breakfast. I think we got a good package for what we paid. Our room was on the 7th (top) floor. It occupied a corner of the hotel above the hotel entrance. It, therefore, had a great view. The room had a significant amount of glass windows. We found that this amount of glass, plus the fact that Amsterdam was pretty cold during our stay - not a complaint because we were really pleased not to have rain during our four days, meant it was difficult to get the room to a reasonable temperature. We did find it cold in the room at times. We were surprised, given the size of the room, at the lack of space for hanging and storing our clothes. Most of our clothes stayed in our suitcases as there was nowhere to put them. Had we been visiting at a warmer time of the year, i.e. less clothes taken with us, and for only one or two nights, the storage space would have been fine. Last negative comment: the lighting in the room could have been better. Now for the positives: All the staff in the reception and breakfast areas of the hotel were great, friendly and helpful at all times. The buffet breakfast was very good. It offered a good choice of hot and cold food and drink and was taken in a very nice dining room. We needed to leave the hotel early on our last day, before the buffet breakfast service commenced. We were very pleased that we were able to take an early room service breakfast at no extra cost. The hotel is very clean and modern. We were very pleased with its location. We would not have wanted to have been in the busier centre of Amsterdam, and found the museum area to be just right. We could walk to the centre easily when we wanted to and found some very good restaurants close to the hotel. We were particulary pleased with Brasserie Bark and De Knijp, only 10 minutes walk away on Van Baerlestraat. When we arrived at Schiphol we took the Connexxion shuttle to the hotel. We also used this for our return journey. This is an excellent value means of travelling between hotel and airport in Amsterdam.

This hotel was a different story, the building itself looked a little tired from the outside and didn't get better inside. Room was adequate and, while there was no peeling paint, it was crying out for redecoration; it was certainly not up the level we would have expected from NH. The lifts were very small and slow. Normally I am happy to use the stairs for a couple of floors, but the stairs were also pretty cramped, steep and institutional. Breakfast was, at best, OK. There was a reasonable selection of food available on a buffet counter, however, if you want any of the cooked food options (e.g. fried eggs), you have to rely on a single chef, standing in the middle of the buffet counter making food on two gas rings. That in itself wasn't a problem, the issue was more the fact that the chef was rarely there and would just disappear if you didn't queue up.

Voila, you get your morning constitutional, an apple turnover fresh out of the oven and a latte in less than 45 minutes. Breakfast for 4=less than $20 a day.

The only downside about this hotel is that it is not located in central Amsterdam...but mind you, I've heard that's a godsend. I did try to follow the directions which were given on this site but to no success - it actually added to the confusion when I asked which tram went to \"Hobbemakade\" at the bus terminal at Centraal Station. Arriving at Schipol Airport, do not get the shuttle bus - its costs something like \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12 whilst the train to Centraal Station costs about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.60. We bought an IAmsterdam card because we didn't want to worry about buying tickets when getting on the public transport. Get the train on platform 2 to Centraal Station. Outside at the tram terminal, go to the stop for trams 16 and 24 (this is currently located on the otherside of the large blue construction site on track 4). The stop you are looking for is \"Ruysdaelstraat\"...unlike the UK, the trams speak to you and tell you which stop it is stopping at. On the tram, you are looking for a door knob looking black button on the side walls, thats the bell! Press that and the tram will stop at the next stop....but remember to press the button by the doors to get out (we made the mistake on the first day of waiting at the doors and the tram then subsequently driving off without letting us off!). Hobbemakade is the road next to the stop, look up at the side of the buildings and you will see the hotel name. We arrived an hour before check-in but the receptionist very courteous and checked us in anyway. We were also allocated a beautiful room on the top floor - a panoramic view of the canal below us and stars at night! The rooms are clean - oh and the shower! BEWARE! Hot on this shower is SCALDING!! I recommend setting the temperature of the water before walking into the bath. Room was cleaned everyday. Overall - an excellent excellent stay!

We were put up there by KLM as their flight cancellation from the UK to Amsterdam meant we missed our connection to Bangkok.

We were given meal vouchers but didnt use them, but the food that was coming out looked tremendous. It had a great atmosphere, very relaxed (Dutch). The only thing I would say is that it is a fair walk to the bright lights of Amsterdam, but the taxi took 5 mins. Lots of Air Crew around in the morning, and the breakfast on offer here is amazing.

It was central enough and easily accessible to the hussle and bussel by tram service. Everything one could ask for was in the vicinity of the hotel also- coffee shops, a small inconspicuous red light area at night (if viewing such is on your tourist 'to do' list), museums, lovely park, supermarket, open street market- without the droves of tourists one would find in the city centre. The area around the hotel is a very nice part of the city. Our room could be cleaned each day up until 4pm which was great as we left the hotel late each day. Lovely view of people going by in their boats on the canal. Vending machine on the corridor sold beer. The 2 biggest pluses were the black-out curtains and air conditioning.

This hotel is only a couple of blocks from the (temporary) Rijksmuseum and van Gogh museum. Otherwise, there is not much within a block or two (shops, restaurants), but the NH is close to a tram line. Also, walking to the city center is safe and only about 15 minutes (watch out for the bycyclists). If you want to go to the north side of Amsterdam (Central Station and Red Light District), the walk is considerably longer.

Breakfast (not incl.) while seemingly pricey (16 euros) was decent quality, eggs the way you like, good choices decent start of a day. You'll only need a light lunch, then a good dinner. Staff was very helpful. If you're not enamored with European duvet's, ask for an extra bottom sheet (they don't use fitted sheets), and use the blanket provided. Temperature control was good, we were able to leave the window open all day, then turn the air on at night to cool the room down for sleeping. Cons: Housekeeping, while at a high standard for cleanliness, wasn't necessarily at a 4-star level. We were only given one-set of towels repeatedly, and would find the sheet and blanket replaced with the duvet every other day. Annoying, but quickly corrected. Some front desk staff are more helpful then others; they have maps, some give them, and advice freely, others it's like pulling teeth. Don't be surprised if they're recommendations aren't what you want, the secret be as specific as possible, e.g., instead of a place nearby to eat, ask for a nice restaurant, serving 'traditional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dutch food with minimal smoking (if preferred), that's quiet. Otherwise you're likely to get a really smoky \"dive\" that probably has good food, but leaves a lot to be desired. Bottom line. Reasonable price, excellent location, and quiet (props to the previous mention of the curtains, they are thick). With a tram stop within a 10 minute walk, as well as the major art museums 10 minutes away, don't worry about being in the town center, this is close enough. Tips: Friday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s both the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum are open until 22:00. If you plan on going to both, as well as a few others, think about the year long museum pass (30 euros), it's the best deal. The bigger souvenir shops sell tram tickets. A 15 trip ticket goes for 7.00 Euro, you can hop on by the Van Gogh, and get to the central station in under 5 minutes.
