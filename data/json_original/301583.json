The legend may speak for itself, so I'll touch upon irking issues, if I had to spend all that money out of my pocket: We were given a courtyard room (ground floor), shrouded by plants which gave us privacy. The rooms/suites are classical colonial style, but I was shocked to have the old type tube TV instead of a flat screen - my last sighting of a tube TV in a top-notch hotel would have been perhaps at least 5 years ago... The air-conditioning was terrible - very cold no matter what temperature setting we did - so we called for maintenance, and at 10 in the evening, they came, but the problem could not be resolved. Instead, the a/c was switched off and the entrance a/c was sufficient to provide cooling (and more quietly). The main thing is that they attended and acknowledged the problem. At that late hour, we were preparing for bed and moving rooms was going to be inconvenient. Breakfast was good, nothing spectacular - I've seen better elsewhere. Service and attendance was excellent - we had room service. Bed comfort was very good - had a good night's rest. Gym - probably one of the most pathetic I've seen in any luxury hotel. Apart for the few quirks mentioned above, which I think the hotel could make up for if one were staying for several days if you had to pay an average of $700/night, I'd still give this old lady a 5* rating.

It was a lovely setting and the staff were very courteous. Two of our party had a starter and all six ordered their signature meal - Welsh shoulder of lamb that had been slow cooked for 36 hours. We also ordered a bottle of White and red wine together with some water. When the lamb arrived only three of the meals were edible - three cooked perfectly and three raw and running with blood. We complained to the staff that three of the meals were impossible to eat. After some 5 minutes the executive chef came to see us and he spent 10 minutes explaining how his meal was cooked. We asked why three meals were perfect and three were not. He just shrugged his shoulders and said \"it happens like that sometimes\". I fail to understand why a meal which has been cooking for a day and a half can be raw in the middle but the chef was adamant there was nothing wrong with it. He offered us an alternative meal but our companions had finished their meal by then and we felt that the moment had passed. He then offered us desserts as complementary and we accepted the desserts as we were by then quite hungry. Finally we had coffee and chocolates.

However, about the time we checked in my husband realized he'd left his cell phone at security coming off the ship into Singapore. The concierge assisted him by calling to check on it. He gave my husband the name of the person to go see at the port and apologized that they could not send someone to get it for him. But, he explained that my husband would have to identify it and then put him in a cab. While he was gone, the manager took my daughter and me up to the pool area to relax and wait for his return. We were served a lovely refreshment \"on the house\" while we were waiting. After perhaps an hour, the manager returned with my husband showing him where we were.

The rooms are spectacular, with extraordinarily high ceilings, a separate sitting room, marble filled bathroom with an wonderful soaker tub, and the highest quality linens, soaps, furniture you'll find.

But don't worry! A quick call to the butler and a new, dry bath mat is delivered. The rooms are very quiet despite the road noise and music outside in the courtyard. The beds are spectacular; I have never slept so well. The location is good, with easy access to the subway and a short taxi ride to many restaurants, bars and the water area. The service at this hotel was simply the best I have ever experienced. Whether checking in, or eating in the lovely Tiffen Room for breakfast, the staff were warm and welcoming, always willing to accommodate with a smile. I used the gym a few times, and to warn you, it is quite small. Also, it is warmer than I would have liked it to be, but the quip meant is relatively new. Also, the pool area is a little oasis in the heart of the city, with palm trees and perfectly warm water. There is also a bar out there too. I spent a good amount of time reading the newspaper in the public areas on the second and third floor of the lobby. It is a wonderfully relaxing environment, and there is often piano music floating up from below. What a great experience! My only advice would be to skip the Singapore Sling at the long bar, which is quite small and exceptionally expensive. However, if you must, go in the evening when the band plays.

It was completely outdoors , but with no fans, misting or A/c be prepared to get moist ! The choice of dishes was very small ( 5 starters/ 5 mains ) and when we asked for just a plain green salad it was not possible ( we had to have a full chicken ceaser !) - which seemed strange as on the breakfast buffet they had laid out a full salad bar ( which nobody touched ! ) even though it's a seafood restaurant I would have expected some other add-ons/ choice for those who want a blend of food.

To put it simply, this must be the best hotel in Singapore, in terms of characters and charms. The service is excellent, like you would expect from the Mandarin Oriental or Ritz Carlton but with the extra touch from the butlers in the hotel. On the first day of my check in I was walking around the hotel ground but got 'lost' and suddenly a uniformed guy called out my name and said \"Mr Sia your room is 223 and it is in that direction\". I was pleasantly shocked because I have never seen him during my stay but yet he knows who I am. And then he introduced himself as Avalro and he is my butler. You can be staying at Ritz Carlton or Mandarin Oriental but regardless how nice the hotel or the room is, it is just another 5* hotel, but what sets Raffles hotel apart from others is the history behind it and you truely feel like going back in time and living the life of high society. If I am not wrong this hotel went through a major renovation in the 90's but till date it has been maintained quite well. The whole hotel is like a labyrinth and after walking around a few times, I still couldn't quite figure out the hotel's floor plan, but it is this that adds to the charm coz every turn in a corner will delight you in many different ways. I booked the Palm Court Suite but was upgraded to one of their Personality Suite (to be exact it is named Gavin Young whom I believe was a writer and you can find two of his written books in the room). To be honest I managed to peep into some of the other rooms types and I concluded that all the Courtyard Suites, Palm Court Suites and Personality Suites are of the same room design, other than the Courtyard Suites being few square meters smaller and lacking a powder table and Palm Court Suites and Personality Suites are exactly the same but the Personality Suites have the extra name tag on the door depending on which famous person it is attributing to. Judging on this I would say it is not worth the money to pay extra for the Palm Court Suite nor the Personality Suite. I personally like the extra touch that they have door signs in front of the entrance saying 'Residents Only' and no outsiders can come in to the lobby unless you are a guest. This adds to the exclusivity of your stay, though I do get asked many times when entering the hotel since I am a local (which is no big deal though). In a nut shell this is a truely fine and exquisite hotel and everything is excellent.

My husband & I had 4 days here in a Palm Court Suite and our stay lived up to all expectations. From the moment you walk through the beautiful entrance you are treated with the utmost courtesy and genuine friendliness that belies the fact this is a commercial establishment that has a huge turnover of guests. Guests have their own Butlers who are on duty 24 hours a day and will appear within minutes of you buzzing them - no request is too difficult and they remember if you have certain preferences. Our Butlers were wonderful and provided little surprises during our stay. On our last night we had booked for Dinner in the Grille but after breakfast, lunch & the High Tea mid afternoon we couldn't eat another thing so cancelled and opted to stay in our Suite after a swim in the pool. What did our Butlers do - set up our verandah table with a vase of red roses and scattered orchids and arrived with an ice bucket of champagne - really touching and appreciated. The Palm Court is beautiful, particularly at night with the lights on and free from all traffic noise. The suites all lead off the wide verandah that surrounds the Court and outside each suite is a wicker table & chairs - perfect for relaxing with coffee or a cocktail. The suites themselves are spacious with a smallish sitting/dining room as you enter with a sofa, chairs & TV, dining table & chairs and a fridge. There is also an internet connection here. You can request tea making facilities but not coffee as it is freshly brewed and the Butlers deliver it on request. Fresh fruit and bottled water is delivered daily. The bedroom is large with an extremely comfortable King bed, sofa, plenty of cupboard space and an additional TV. To the rear of the bedroom is a large dressing room with twin basins which leads to a bathroom with shower, bath, loo and a drying rack for those wet bathers, etc. We ate breakfast in the Tiffin Room each day which is a relaxing experience. Tea, coffee, juice are brought to you on arrival and orders taken for the hot component. There is also a large selection of food from the buffet - all delicious. High Tea is also served in the Tiffin Room and is very popular with non guests. We opted to take High Tea one afternoon in the guests area on the first floor overlooking the foyer - a lovely experience. Cocktails on the verandah outside the Billiard Room were also relaxing and we did this on several occasions. They have a selection of excellent cigars which really appealed to my husband. At the rear of the Raffles complex is a large courtyard containing restaurants, cafes, an excellent bakery for sandwiches and some fabulous shops. The Raffles Shop has a huge variety of souvenirs to suit all tastes. And the oasis within an oasis is the Spa, pool and bar on the roof where we relaxed at some point every day. The staff are terrific and will go out of their way to fill your orders, whether it be for a certain type of drink or light meal. And there are little touches like fresh berries on skewers and nuts to nibble on. There is so much history at Raffles and much of it has been retained. The ambiance is fabulous with a great deal of thought put into the detail - little nooks and crannies where you can sit and read or just people watch, the amazing floral arrangements that pop up in the most unexpected places, listening to the pianist of an evening, the tradition of the clock in the foyer - they all add up to the perfect hotel - a world away from the daily hustle & bustle of the city. You can request a late checkout (available depending on how busy Raffles is) but even if you have an evening flight you can check out, leave your luggage in the baggage room and Raffles will give you another key that gives you access to the guests precinct including the pool area where there are dressing rooms and showers to freshen up.

The classic hotel is 120 years old and has a very colonial feel to it. You will not confuse the hotel for a Mandarin Oriental or a Four Seasons. If you are expecting all the latest electronics and gorgeous modern bathrooms, you will be sorely disappointed. if you like classic old rooms with high ceilings, ceiling fans and high service levels at high prices, Raffles may just be the place for you. I booked into the hotel using the AmEx Fine hotels programme, which provides a series of benefits including an upgrade, if one is available. When I checked in, I asked for an upgrade and was told that none was available at the suite level immediately above the Palm Court level - The Personality Suites. However when I checked the hotel's website after getting into my room I saw that there was, in fact, availability in that level of rooms with a choice of either a king or twin beds for the full duration of my stay. My suite was reasonably large, with a king bed and high quality sheets and pillows and decorated in an old fashioned style with heavy mahogany furniture. There was a small (22\"?) TV in the armoire - a CRT, rather than a flat screen. The bathroom was reasonably spacious but had slightly antiquated plumbing with a few water sounds from the pipes and a shower door that creaked.and a tiny scratched bathtub. Service levels were high, other than the snafu when checking in and a slow room cleaning on the second day of my trip. The buffet breakfast was of high quality and with a pretty wide selection and additionally had a menu of cooked dishes such as the (not very well prepared) eggs benedict that I ordered. I went to the gym a couple of times, which is small with only 4 cardio machines, 1 weight machine and some free weights. The hotel offers free wireless internet service, but the speed was too slow to easily support streaming video. I think the right demographic for this classic old hotel is either elderly (60s and 70s) or someone who loves antiques and old colonialism. For me Raffles, while impressive in some ways, is just not my cup of tea. When next in Singapore I will stay at one of the new 5 star luxury places rather than returning to Raffles. .", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cRaffles Review\u201d", "Author": "cgtree", "ReviewID": "UR119187085", "Content": "One doesn't choose Raffles if looking for a hip, vibrant hotel.

I went to Singapore for 10 days of R and R and visit friends. I had read warm and glowing reviews of this property. I loved the images views of this historic property with British influence. I decided I see the grounds and enjoy lunch in the courtyard. Yes the grounds are wonderful but the staff at the court yard dining area lacked attention to detail and were rather unfriendly group. Our table was approached and asked for a drink order. The two of us have given up on spirits cause they don't work for us. We informed our server that we would be dining and that we were not drinkers. We would opt for water. Once we made that comment it was down hill from there. The water glasses were dumped on the table and the waiter abruptly took off. Another waiter finally appeared and took our order. I ordered a Club Sandwich and my partner selected a salad off the menu. Mind you we are talking lunch not dinner. Were they busy? I would say moderate and the staff was rushed. My club sandwich arrives and there are two small sandwich sections on the plate with some fries. My expectation was a full sandwich with no fries. This is a first for me to see the portion served like that. Skip the fries and do a sandwich or charge me more and give me a full sandwich. Next my partner's salad come out in plastic container with lid. Think your common grocery store deli to go container with snap lid. The side dressing came with a souffle cup with snap on lid. The expectation was to receive a small salad plate that had been chilled with maybe the dressing on the side. We have my sandwich plated and my partner's salad in a tupperware bowl. We thought they had pulled the salad from the take out cooler and forgot to plate it. We looked around to notice salads being served this way at other tables. No we were not out by a pool where glass breakage would be an issue. First impressions are lasting impressions. A hotel at this level can charge what they want but it should be appealing and served with respect and graciousness. I am willing to tip in spite of what I order. A guest no matter if it is hotel or dining with you has chosen you and has expectations. Lots of places in Singapore to spend my money. I decided not to return and have high tea at Raffles but instead opt for the Fullerton.

We arrived to a warm welcome late afternoon, check in was swift and efficient.we were shown to our courtyard suite 109 which was stunning. Unpretentious elegance is how I would describe it. We were travelling with our 6 year old son and a nice touch was that they placed in the bathroom a miniature dressing gown and a child's toothbrush and paste in there for his use. The room was spacious and spotless with a separate parlour area. Outside your room you had your own table and chairs which was ideal for quiet late night drinks in your own oasis. We used the hotel pool one afternoon which we had to ourselves, the service was second to none, someone always on hand to assist you. They had steam rooms in the changing rooms which were nice. The main hotel was gorgeous with a heady fragrance of frangipani lingering in the air. We of course made several trips to the long bar, and although we have visited before on previous trips to Singapore , this time being a resident they made you feel extra special just by simply greeting you by your name as soon as you entered the long bar even though you'd never met the member of staff before, also always taking you to a reserved table even when the bar was crowded and they brought us complimentary whole fruit dessert/iced drinks. I remember sitting outside on the veranda one day and a waitress coming up to me that I'd never met and saying Mrs Hicks can I get you a glass of water for your comfort? It's these small attentions to detail that makes a stay memorable. Similarly one day whilst in the gift shop which is open to the public I was enquiring about stamps and a particular umbrella that we had in our room which was not for sale to the general public, I was advised to go to concierge. After visiting the raffles museum ( which is well worth a visit as it is enchanting) I arrived at concierge without introducing myself to be told Mrs Hicks your stamps and your umbrella ! The staff were attentive without beings intrusive which is exactly how it should be. They arranged a late check out which was ideal and we were extremely sad to leave.

As the floors are wooden, you can hear walking noises from the floor above your suite. So what, that's how guests lived with during the late 1880s and early 1900s. They have lifts but somehow you are drawn into re-living history by taking the stairs. You can spend the whole day exploring the hotel grounds and not get tired of it. So much history in it.

It was our 4th stay since 1992 and I never cease to be impressed by the quality of the experience. There are certainly more opulent hotels in the world but surely there are none with better service and general ambience. The checkin, the butlers introduction to the rooms features and facilities, tea and coffee being delivered without charge at a touch of the butlers call button, the attention to detail, the friendly smiles and welcoming comments by passing staff were all features. Raffles does a whole lot extremely well. Attention to detail was demonstrated in relation to Kayes birthday. The hotel had not been informed of the ocassion but I guess they observed the date is in her passport . I was called in the room to say that it was noted that we had a celebration coming up. We came back from the pool to find the room decorated with birthday greetings and balloons, and towels folded as frogs. Our bulter and an assistant turned up with a birthday cake and our celebrations were well under way. The rooms are huge with fresh fruit was provided daily. The room is serviced more than once each day and still has a genuine turn down service. At the pool cold bottled water , chilled towels and fruit skewers were delivered by the pool attendant /barman without request or charge and towels were arranged for guests on the sun beds. The front desk staff kept track of our changing flight departure time. The pianist in the writers bar is just brilliant. Leslie, the historian who has been at Raffles for 40 years, met us at breakfast in the Tiffin room, and arranged to take us on a tour of the hotel. We had a chance to recall things about Singapore and the hotel from the 70's when we first visited the hotel to have a Singapore Sling in the old long bar. Raffles does everything you expect from a 5 star hotel and much much more.

The colonial style hotel is breath-taking and this era is carried on through to the decor in the suites, the uniforms of the staff, the many bars and restaurants, and also the pool area. Our suite was fabulous: massive bedroom with ceiling fan and dark-wood furniture, sitting room/ dining area and beautiful bathroom with double sink and separate shower/ bath/ toilet room. It was very warm when we were there, so we used the ceiling fan quite a lot. We found the staff very accommodating and friendly, even when we were walking through the grand foyer to the pool area, dressed in beachwear and flip flops! No one questioned whether or not we were residents of the hotel, as we had read in previous reviews. It is a busy hotel, as it is a main tourist attraction, but we had no problem getting seated on the few occasions that we went to the Long Bar for Singapore Slings. The bar had an excellent atmosphere and the drinks are amazing. We were able to order Singapore Slings by the pool as well, and in the Courtyard Bar, where we enjoyed our last evening at the hotel, writing postcards. The bar staff were very friendly, making Caipirinha cocktails for my husband, trying out different fruits each time. The pool area is fabulous. We had read in some reviews that it was in need to renovation and we did notice that the spa is out of order, but apart from that the style is in-keeping with the rest of the hotel and we enjoyed using the pool most days.

We partook of complimentary Singapore Slings on the verandah. We booked the Indian Curry buffet, excellent choice and fantastic curries. Breakfast, served in the Tiffin Room, again was a culinary delight. All too soon our one night of luxury was over. We had pre-arranged a transer to the airport (not thru Raffles), which for various reasons did not arrive. Analyn on the front desk went out of her way to solve our problem (thank you). We were whisked into a taxi, waved off, and on our way to the airport. The pool area has loungers/umbrellas/towels. We received complimentary water, small fruit kebabs and a smoothie. This for us is chilling out in style. Sitting on the verandah, sipping Singapore Slings, we were not aware that there was a bustling city outside of Raffles walls. We had a wonderful nights sleep. Be sure to visit the Museum and learn about Raffles history. This little Museum needs someone to make it a little sharper - it really is an overlooked gem from our/their proud Colonial past.

My husband and I just came back a week ago after spending 5 wonderful days at the Raffles. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty and I have never experienced such amazing hotel staff. We stayed in a Palm Court suite (209) which is in a quiet area of the hotel where no tourists have access. The suite was very spacious and decorated in a colonial style with lovely furniture. Outside your door you have your own table and chairs so you can enjoy the beautiful Palm Court with a cup of tea or maybe a Singapore Sling. You have 24 hour butler service and our butler Fidel went out of his way to make sure that we had everything we needed. The butlers bring you free tea and coffee and we never had to wait long when we made an order. The room service menu has a good choice and the prices are not more expensive than any other 5-star hotel. We ate at several of the restaurants, all which were superb but if you like fine dining to a T I would recommend the Raffles Grill (and the wine list is amazing). After dinner you can enjoy listening to the fantastic pianist Jimmy who entertains in the Writer\u2019s Bar. Raffles has a resident historian, Mr Leslie Danker who gladly shares historical anecdotes with the hotel guests. We had breakfast with Mr Danker and after breakfast he took us on a historical tour of the hotel which was one of our highlights during our stay. I highly recommend that you meet Mr Danker during your stay as he is a true Raffles original (and he has also written a wonderful book about his years in the hotel). The spa, gym and pool are located on the third floor and we enjoyed spending a few hours by the pool every day. The most amazing thing with the Raffles staff is that they seem to know what you want before you even ask for it and this was certainly the true with pool staff as every time I thought about ordering more water, the waiter was already next to me with new water! So, is the Raffles worth the price? To me the answer is a definitely yes and it does not get much better than this. I have had the good fortune of staying in many famous hotels around the world but I have never experienced such good service as in the Raffles. I could go on and on about the amazing staff, but I think the only way to experience it is to go yourself.

Raffles Hotel is a jewel in the crown of the hotel industry, renowned and loved for its inimitable style and unsurpassed excellence in service and facilities. This is one of the world's most beloved grand hotels and welcomes everyone as if you are royalty. On arrival we were greeted by very friendly and professional staff. We spent very little time in the reception area as they are so well organised once your details have been established you are taken to your suite by your very own personal butler, where your experience begins. The suites are very grand and they have maintained the colonial style inside, that is synonymous with this grand hotel. The service was the best we have ever experienced in 30 years of travelling the world. Services & Staff. The staff at the hotel were the most professional I have ever encountered and the service they provide was outstanding. They were always very smart, polite, would never pass a hotel guest without exchanging pleasantries or engage in conversation. I would say they are the elite of the service industry. There are many restaurants and designer shops within the complex and an outdoor swimming pool & bar. (However, this area is a little tired and in need of refurbishment) Restaurant, Bar & The Food. The many restaurants and bars within the hotel. You can eat in an American diner, Courtyard Restaurants with a fine selection of fish, a American Style Steakhouse and the finest of restaurants in the Raffles Grill. You can also have a leisurely ding in the lobby bar, Ah Teng's Bakery, The Tiffin Room, or enjoy the famous Singapore Sling in the Longhouse Bar where you eat your peanuts and throw the shells on the floor. They also serve great snacks here where you can soak up the atmosphere with the many non- residential tourists that visit this bar. I dined in 5 of the restaurants and enjoyed everyone. My favorite, however, was The Raffles Grill. The food here was cooked to perfection and the service was faultless. Overall This is without doubt one of the finest hotels in the world. From the time you enter the hotel until you departure you are treated like royalty. The food was first class in every restaurant that we dined in and the service was out of this world. The staff are so professional that they ensure your stay at the hotel is memorable, and it was.

Unfortunately this stay was not as perfect as our previous stays have been. Firstly the staffing level seems to have been cut dramatically. This means that the restaurant is not as well run as it was before. Also the staff no longer make any attempt to remember the guests names, not a major problem, but one of the little extras that made Raffles special. The butler service also makes minor mistakes, we ordered early morning tea for 7.15am and then get an early morning alarm call at 7.30am?? We were also given possibly the smallest suite in the place, even though the hotel was very far from full, surely this is not good business to upset regular guests. The housekeeping service has also deteriorated. Suites are no longer thoroughly cleaned. There was an unpleasant stain on the matress cover in our suite. During our previous stays the suite was checked several times a day and towels replaced throughout the day, now there is only a visit in the morning and turndown at night, which can be any time between 6.30pm and 10pm. Unfortunately, this has probably soured my experience of the hotel so much that we will be unlikely to return. Raffles has lost it's charm. Let's hope that it finds it's way back to graciousness before it also loses too may of its guests.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bedford", "Title": "\u201cInauspicious start to CNY\u201d", "Author": "woodyMK", "ReviewID": "UR96129034", "Content": "Arrived in Palm Court Suite to find orange tree with rotting fruits and dead leaves this was pointed out and on returning later it had been stripped of all fruits.

The bath room/toilet door did not close due to ill fitting tiles binding on the door . During our stay several ligt bulbs failed and these were never replaced,nor was the bowl of small, dried up mandarin oranges from day three of our stay. Rudyard Kipling would be disappointed how the standards of food have slipped in the Tiffin Room. The breakfast buffet is not as extensive as in previous stays, more dishes have to be ordered but due to less staff these arrived cold. There used to be a waiter patrolling with tea & coffee to keep you topped up now you have to ask for more this is decanted from a large pot and delivered to your table lukewarm With less staff tables were not cleared quickly and Sivam one of the waiters seemed to be on the run all the time. Several residents appeared to be more suitably dressed for the beach rather than breakfast ,if you want to breakfast in shorts, T shirts & flip flops stay at one of the resort hotels! Afternoon tea has also changed for the worse. Instead of the vast array of sandwiches ,cakes , pastries scones and hot dishes on the buffet, It is a \"three plate\" tea with a few other additions. There appeared to be a great deal of wastage from these pre filled plates. Yet again the supply of tea was very poor and the waiter seemed more interested in trying to encourage diners to have either champagne or a sling. At all meal times there was a constant barrage of camera flashes. Why do people need to take a picture of a plate of food,a teapot and a glass of pink fizzy? Since our last visit you are now provided with morning tea in your room The Doormen, swimming pool and gardens are just as good. The Lion Dance for CNY outside and in the lobby was excellent.

Because we couldn't agree on the hotels, we decided to stay in three different hotels. Therefore, we stayed two nights at the Raffles, two nights at the Fullerton Hotel and one night - for shopping reasons - at the Grand Hyatt. The Raffles is an amazing hotel and truly one of the most legendary hotels in the world. Because we booked with American Express, we received a complimentary upgrade to a Palm Court Suite as well as an early/late-check-out and a SPA voucher. The very attentive staff checked us in quickly and our Buttler showed us our colonial-styled suite in the beautiful Palm Court. I would recommend a suite in the Pam Court Wing, since the Courtyard Wing is a bit touristy and probably can be a little loud. The suites are very well equiped with WiFi and everything you expect from Raffles. You will be welcomed with a Singapore Sling, Chocolates and a fruit basket. If you like the colonial-style, you will love the room, if you're more into a modern-style, it won't be your cup of tea. Since the world famous Singapore Sling was founded at the Raffles, you have to try at least one of them at the Long Bar. We asked at the reception, where we can find the Long Bar and obviously they already informed the bar staff that we will arrive. The bar staff greeted us by name and led us to a table in a separate area for hotel quests. Food and drinks there were good, but not excellent. The Raffles do have a nice Pool area and SPA on the roof of the hotel. Staff is very friendly and attentive and the SPA is excellent.

Privacy is of utmost importance and unless you need anything, no one will bother you in the slightest way. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. My suite (#228 Courtyard Suite) was right underneath the pool, where one could hear a bit of water filter noise coming through the ceiling, but no drama really. The only thing missing in the suites were tea and coffee maker facilities. Asking why there are none, I was told that the hotel prefers to make tea and coffee as a presentation and serve in your room or veranda, instead of making it yourself, well fair enough, but how about if I get up at 3am and feel like a tea? Do I need to wait for the butler to come and serve it 20mins later and what if I want more tea after...I really prefer to have free coffee and tea maker facilities in-room as in almost every hotel on the planet and have the option to have it served when needed. Otherwise really nothing major to complain about. LCD Tv's would be nice in the cabinets, instead of the 80's style tubes, wireless internet jumps in and out, not convenient for conference calls, wired internet in rooms would be much better.

If you are a business traveler looking for top notch service, pristine accommodations, and modern convenience, then I would not stay here. Don't get me wrong, the place is clean and very nice, but this hotel is all about the old world charm, and it has tons of it. The rooms are cozy and romantic - they have a little ante room with a table and chairs, perfect for working or having breakfast (or any meal for that matter I suppose), but right outside each room is a table and wicker chairs overlooking a courtyard - very cool and great to relax in. The bedrooms are spacious but dated. My ipad has a similarly sized screen to the old tv's there - I didn't care, I didn't come to watch tv. To get to your room, you take an elevator to a hall, to a short staircase to a veranda, and a couple turns later...you get the idea, old hotel=serpentine ways to find things. There is no wonder that so many authors and journalists have stayed here - there is a real \"Harry's Bar\" feel to this place. The people could not have been nicer. The food was excellent - a lot of choices on the room service menu and on the premises. Delivery was fast and polite - prices reasonable for a top end hotel. Pool was wonderful, gym is new equipment, not a lot of it, but elliptical and treadmills, etc...enough for a business traveler. Lot of shops at the hotel and across the street from a mall. So the cab driver dropped me off on the shopping side and not the hotel side, and getting to the front from the back is pretty difficult - so make sure the cab driver is taking you to the check in area - the hotel main entrance, otherwise, you are in the Matrix without a map. I usually respond only to the high end hotels with the best service - I figure if you are paying for excellence, then they should deliver it. This is one where I am 85% sure I would stay here again if going to Singapore - why? I am pretty sure if I had to guess, the Four Seasons is better in a lot of categories relating to modernity and efficiency, but the feel for this hotel, it's historical vibe was great. If coming on business, I am not so sure - coming with a spouse or significant other for a pleasure trip, then I would stay here. I saw the casino's by the way - there is no reason to stay there if you don't have to - they are lame.

The food came hot and freshly prepared, with full service which included laying a full table in the room with cutlery crockery and serving the food all with a welcome smile.

This hotel makes a great first impression; the iconic fa\u00e7ade is beautiful in real life, and our car was met by an immaculately liveried doorman. The sense of history throughout the property is almost palpable, which can\u2019t be captured in a photograph, or by standing looking in from the street. I think that\u2019s what makes being a guest there feel so special. Upon checking in we were greeted by our butler who announced that we had been given an upgrade from a Palmcourt Suite to the Andr\u00e9 Malraux Suite, which was a lovely surprise. Our suite was beautiful, and just what you\u2019d expect for a 100+yo building; a little shabby-chic in places, but spacious and bursting with charm and character. We loved the wide, creaky old floorboards, the shutters and the panelling. When combined with the beautifully appointed furnishings, the suite had that calm, individual, utterly unpretentious feel that, for me, always signifies a seriously good hotel room. Our suite was directly across and up from the gift-shop and at night the overall affect of the lights through the tropical foliage was restful and beautiful. There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the suites. If you want coffee, you call the butler. Everything else is as you\u2019d expect. Linen/toiletries/water pressure/robes etc: check. Once settled, we went ahead and did what one does at Raffles. We explored. We took High Tea at the Tiffin Room, drank Singapore Slings, browsed in the gift shop and wandered through the Arcade and the gardens. We visited the museum, wallowed in spa products and breakfasted at Ah Tengs Bakery. Our stay was only short (we were essentially in transit on our way home from Thailand) and there was so much to do and see that we checked in and essentially didn\u2019t set foot outside the property again until it was time to check out. Wherever we went, the staff were unfailing friendly and gracious and always greeted us by name. On our second day we decided to take a quick last minute trip to Marina Bay Sands and Orchard Road. Our plane departed at 9.30pm that night and the hotel seemed to be in no particular hurry for us to leave, which was nice. The check out process was smooth, the charges were accurate, our luggage was stored without fuss and a taxi was booked in advance for the trip to the airport. Downside? Hmmm. Not that much. After prompting by the wait-staff I ordered a \u00bd bottle of champagne with High Tea and was told that the actual tea would arrive later on; but it never did. The butler service was a little patchy and we twice phoned with small housekeeping requests that didn\u2019t eventuate. A pair of running shoes that my son left outside our door were not picked up with our luggage and vanished, never to be seen again (no great loss there!) I\u2019m one of those travellers who will happily stay somewhere \u2018middle of the road\u2019 for the majority of a trip in order to splurge on somewhere fabulous last couple of nights. I can honestly say that I\u2019ve stayed in much prettier locations, in more beautifully appointed suites, received more attentive service, enjoyed better food\u2026.but (and its a big but) it\u2019s the sum of the parts that adds up to something amazing at Raffles.

The Hotel is beautiful with incredible history, we loved exploring it floor by floor...courtyards and verandahs as well. The early photos are so interesting...a member of staff stopped and explained the photos to me and showed me where many of them were taken... The personal service is first class, you ARE special as a guest at Raffles and are addressed by name by almost every member of staff. I was amazed to be personally greeted as I wandered about the Hotel. If you're looking for wow rooms, then you may be disappointed, but they are lovely original and spacious suites...the only thing I'd replace would be the toilet, which looked a bit dated. Every room is a suite comprising a dining/sitting room, large bedroom and a dressing room/bathroom - you also have a table and chairs on the verandah outside your room...we sat out there and drank our complimentary French champagne, ate our chocolates and fruit and enjoyed the balmy evening...we then took a dip in the open air pool. The pool is a private area and once again, the service is outstanding...towels draped over the sun lounge for you, complimentary iced water and chilled berries on tiny skewers for your enjoyment. Nothing is overlooked... The lobby and Hotel are closed off to the public, which makes it a quiet and cool space. The public can access the restaurants and Long Bar and shop in Raffles arcade of shops, but otherwise the lobby, main Hotel, swimming pool and spa are guests only. This policy is enforced by the Hotel and tourists are turned around (politely) at the door. Here is a tip: if you want to take some photos of the amazing lobby, approach the doorman late at night - say midnight...if the lobby is quiet, they may let you have a look. If you're watching your money, stay somewhere else and enjoy a drink at the Long Bar or do some shopping in their gift store, but frankly, we found the Long Bar noisy and crowded and headed back into the Hotel. Everything in the Hotel is expensive, but this is possibly the most famous hotel in the world. An excellent pot of tea in the lobby lounge was $20 with taxes and service charge, but you're not just paying for the tea, but the surroundings, the service, the history, the pianist....

The only slight disappointment was the famous Singapore Slings which are now made in a vat rather than individually and which cost an arm & a leg, but then alcohol is expensive everywhere in Singapore and nothing is cheap in Raffles, so don't go there unless you are planning to splurge. All of the shops in the Raffles complex are beautiful but very high end and very pricey. As for the accommodation cost, we booked about 6 weeks prior on \"Wotif\" and managed to get a great deal, about half the published rack-rate. Make sure breakfast is included, its about as good as hotel breakfasts can possibly get!! Also you must do the High Tea, which is extremely civilised and refined, but make sure you book (your butler will arrange this for you!)

It hosts its own museum, shopping arcade, a bevy of gourmet restaurants to choose from and of course, the Long Bar. Where else would you rather have a Singapore Sling? I found Singapore a likable but strange city. Its tropical setting, colorful architecture, charming Merlion and unique wildlife attractions like the Jurong Bird Park and Night Safari at the zoo were worth the 5 days we spent there, but I expressly did not like that the city was one big mall. Its like a mall, that connects to a mall, that connects to another mall and it never ends. If you go underground, there are malls there too! And it is predominantly western stores, so I didn't feel compelled to buy all that much. I live in NY and travel a lot and strongly believe if I can find it at home, I'm not buying it oversees and figuring out how to pack it! The Raffles was easily my favorite thing in the city and I felt honored to stay there. Our Butler, Shah, was so cheerful and accommodating and every other staff member I encountered had a warmth to them. Our room was huge and I loved the decor and extra touches such as a table for dining and a tiled tub with antique fixtures. The bed was comfortable as well. Standing out on the wraparound porch, watching people shop the arcade, or enjoying music and snacks in the courtyard was the perfect visual to start each morning. The pool area was intimate and well maintained and the afternoon tea service was fantastic. My favorite thing is the tales from the Raffles they leave on the pillow each night. Ending our daily adventure with a tale from the past or a reflection from a notable author who once walked the halls was the cherry on top. My one negative comment is internet costs a fortune. Many much cheaper hotels offer free internet and in this day and age where it is a necessity, it should be included or available at affordable rates.", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth", "Title": "\u201cService service service\u201d", "Author": "AJMBournemouth", "ReviewID": "UR57918331", "Content": "A warm welcome with staff rushing to help with our suitcases.

The room had everything we needed and I didn`t have to ask for extra anything. All the staff were polite and geeted you by name in the restaurant, nothing was too much trouble and they were very attentive. True 5 star plus service. The location of the hotel is good with everything just a walk or quick & cheap taxi ride away. Breakfast was amazing with good quality food and service - if I had to moan or rather comment on anything it would be that hot food arrived before we had completed our fruit, maybe they were a little too eager. The hotel has a fab swimming pool on floor 3 but alas we were too busy to use it. Afternoon tea at approx \u00a325.00 per person is not cheap but the experience and quality are well worth it - if only they would have left the teapot on the table to save us having to ask for refills each time.

Upon arriving we were being looked at as if we were beggars trying to get in there to beg for money from their guests (hardly). As mentioned above I have stayed here before so I know the dress code. Maybe it was my age??? Maybe I needed to be more mature looking??? Anyway arrived there and thought heck as a few of my friends (all married) live and work in Singapore why not treat them to a spa as we always go out for dinners. I know they love it and have their favourite spa\u2019s with whom they regularly receive treatment from. When I asked to check out the spa area they wanted me to get dressed first??? Are you kidding me? I explained to them I just wanted to confirm that I was to spend S$650 per couple (Raffles Signature) for 3 couples and wanted to make sure that I would be getting a descent experience. Still that didn\u2019t work. So picked up my bag and told them I am going to stay at Goodwood Park Hotel as I had never been treated with service so pathetic even at a 3 star hotel. And this is coming from a 5 star hotel. I guess unfortunately my mates, who are both Directors for Citigroup and HSBC (respectively), heard about my experience at Raffles but did also rate Goodwood Park Hotel. Good to know that they\u2019ll be sticking with their chosen spa\u2019s and not waste their time at Raffles. It\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s the service. Raffles Signature indeed!!! I guess at this hotel it is not all about you get what you pay for, but far from it. I made a quick call to another mate (also with Citigroup) who changed their reservations to another hotel nearby. On a positive note the Hotel is nice, the food is ok (for the price your are paying) It\u2019s nice to know that they do stop non-guests (or should I say ill-dressed non guests) trying to get in to have a look. Rooms are a nice size and the whole place does have a nice feel to it - if you can look pass the service. It\u2019s probably just a once off but sometimes it only takes one negative incident. It is just unfortunate that on this ONE occasion the service and treatment got my nose bent out of shape and I would hate to have that experience at a 5 star establishment again.

The room itself whilst fine was very old - and not in a good sense. Very dark, aging amenities, and incredibly noisy when people in the room above walk on the wooden floors.

The rooftop pool area looked ok, although a little on the small side. One aspect that really surprised me was the size of the Raffles Arcade - I'd estimate that the hotel shops took up more space than the rest of the site put together. Even so, the majority of the shops were as with most hotels pretty empty most of the time, and in a city such as Singapore where shopping is such a big draw-card, I wasn't sure why people would pay way over the odds at the hotel when the very same goods can be bought a few minutes away.

Ditto for the Waldorf in New York. Forgive my rave, but either some people like to whinge or they only look at the negatives. So what if something tiny sometimes goes wrong. Get over it and enjoy everything else. These are grand old hotels and an experience that you should have if you can afford it. Anyone can stay at run-of-the-mill five-star hotel, but these places are truly different. Raffles is brilliant. It is like stepping into another world - one that you never want to leave. The service is life-changing. You leave this hotel thinking you have to change the way you live so that it becomes more like the Raffles lifestyle. Things happen here before you know you want them to happen. The staff: How many hotels are there where staff you have never met before know your name? And you children's names as well. This place makes you feel special. Our nine year old daughter picked up a cereal bowl at breakfast and filled it with cornflakes. Instantly she was surrounded by helpers. One added the milk, another carried it to her seat, another pulled out her chair and tucked her back in again. Do you know how special that made her feel? She has stayed in a lot of nice places and didn\u2019t even want to go to Singapore. Raffles is now her No. 1 hotel and she wants to go back to Singapore soon. I can't describe how happy it made me feel taking my family to this hotel. They looked after us better than we ever have been looked after at any hotel in the world before. The truly perfect doormen are another example of the incredible service. There can be up to three of them on hand at any one time. At an ordinary five-star hotel there will be one and if he is off with someone else\u2019s bags you have to wait until he returns or carry your own luggage. At Raffles it\u2019s different: Our taxi would pull up, one doorman would open the doors, they saw our baby and knew we had a pram so another would get it out of the boot and set it up while the third would take the baby from my wife as she got out of the taxi or grab our shopping. We'd be getting out of the taxi saying to each other 'Get the pram' only to see it all set up and ready to go. They do things before you know it and it is so nice. The rooms: They are large and grand and have massive balconies and coffee machines and the softest slippers that are laid out every evening and put away in the mornings, and massive towels that are changed twice a day if you want and an evening quilt and a daytime quilt for the bed, and an amazingly powerful airconditioner. The pool: We extended our stay in Singapore by four days. Unfortunately Raffles was booked out for the last two of these days so we had to move to the No. Rated hotel on trip advisor, the Pan Pacific. Pan Pacific\u2019s pool is huge and BUSY. Our children wouldn\u2019t in it after being at Raffles. At Raffles the staff find you somewhere to lie, they put towels on your lounge, they bring you free water and free fruit and you can buy (expensive) ice cream in silver (plated) bowls with ice under them to keep them cool. The pool rarely has more than two other guests in it and you usually have it all to yourself. I don\u2019t want to go on because part of the joy about staying here is experiencing these things for yourself, but if you like classy things then you would be mad not to stay here. .", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cSophisticated Old Lady in need of refurbish\u201d", "Author": "aiguebelle", "ReviewID": "UR46702292", "Content": "We held our wedding at the Raffles Hotel and paid for a night's stay in the courtyard suite.

Whilst the rooms achieved the vintage look and might be charming for someone into old world charm, however the room was generally tired looking and most of the furniture looked worn out. The bathtub was leaking and the one time we took a bath, there was a steady spray of water from the tub onto the floor resulting in the bathroom being flooded. To their credit, this was quickly rectified when I phoned for the butler who came swiftly with a whole bunch of towels to soak up the mess. Some of the switches in the room didn't work, and neither did the refrigerator and we gave up after a while.

First we saw the picture postcard front of the Raffles and visited the lobby which can only be done - by none-guests - on certain times and you can not wear short' s or too sexy and revealing clothing as well, or it' s a no from the amendable door-man. The lobby in itself was stunning and very colonial in color scheme and tone incl. white and brown plus plush seating and a massive concierge table and a real cashier plus a nice standing clock from historical times which was standing already there when Somerset Maugham visited here way back in time, how romantic to know! After this we strolled further through the hotel and enjoyed the Raffles Courtyard and the gardens plus fountains and we saw not one but two wedding celebration' s going on at the hotel. Having been our second time at this famous hotel we know why you would have your wedding celebration here! A visit to the Raffles is not named simply visit it is named pilgrimage! Our visit to the original Raffles Giftshop was obligatory for us! We bought incl. postcards, t-shirts, a nice book-mark which tells us the Original Singapore Sling receipe, we bought several books incl. the ladies and gentlemen behind the hotel and a history book about the hotel! The bill came at 200 Singapore Dollars for the whole lot! Well worth it! After this very nice past-time we strolled more through the massive romantic grounds of the hotel and visited the world-famous Long Bar located on the first floor of the hotel and he enjoyed the world-famous Singapore Sling ( which was first mixed-up here more than 100 years ago in the same Long Bar in the Raffles Singapore ) priced at 23 Sing. Dollars plus a mango juice and she enjoyed a really old receipe of the Old Fashioned Cocktail here plus a refreshing apple juice and the complementary peanuts we eat and simply throw the peanut shell to the ground like the greats would do before us in another time incl. Kipling and Conrad and and and. The furniture was classical colonial and the atmosphere was upbeat and many people incl. us had taken photos from this world-famous Bar. After this we enjoyed the Raffles Museum on the 3rd floor of the hotel which gives you and us a perfect overview of the complete history of the famous hotel incl. original letters from former famous guests incl. George H. W. Bush ( No. 41 ) and others plus historic photos of the hotel and many artifacts about the hotel incl. the very first mixer set of the Singapore Sling and a photo from the Gentleman who has shot the last free wheeling tiger of Singapore at the Raffles' Billiard Room! The Billiard Table can also be seen there! There were also more newer photos about the recent restoration of the hotel in the 1990' s available to view! All in all a real must when you really want to understand how the Raffles came into being and why it is still with us today! This was our second time visit also to the Raffles Museum and was well worth it, hopefully we can do it a third time and much more in the long-term future! At the end of our second tour of the Raffles we enjoyed ice-cream at the Raffles Creamery ( which is new and was not even there on our first tour in 2002 ) and is operated from the Seah Grill ( in which we had lunch in Nov. 2002 - very nice american fare incl. the famous macaroni and cheese! enjoy! ). We enjoyed at the Raffles Creamery the following drinks and ice-cream incl. a non-alcoholic refreshing tropical colada, one forest berry smoothie plus the following ice-cream combinations incl. she had gianduja kit-kat, rocky road, macadamia nuts and oreo cookies and he had incl. tahiti vanilla, white chocolate, gummi bears and chocolate sauce! A perfect stop when at the Raffles! Especially after such a fine day in Singapore' s foremost historic Landmark Hotel founded in 1887 by the Sarkies brothers from Armenia! Well done! Now we have the hope after our second visit to this hotel that we can eventually stay here at least one night in our lives in the future to even more experience the Raffles Hotel plus the charm and the superb facilities on offer! However a third visit would be also on the cards as you would expect when in Singapore! Happy travel and Happy love! So do not forget to FLY!STAY!EXPLORE! MORE! and be more than happy to have the opportunity to even visit such a fine City and hotel!

We boked on the Raffles website at an early purchase rate which still worked out at about \u00a3250 a night for a Palm Court suite. I had read the reviews on tripadvisor with interest prior to booking and it seemed that the only downside appeared to be the attitude of the front desk. Check in for us was civilised with check-in in the room. The suite was not ready and they had given us one right next to the maids storage room - one of the pleasures of a vacation is getting up at whatever time you wish right? They were however prepared to upgrade to a celebrity suite at no extra cost which was near a fountain [you either get rooms overlooking a green area with palm trees or a fountain at the front of the hotel]. The front is too noisy so stay away from this area. We declined the upgrade due to the noise from the fountain and the front road which is busy. The room we got was in colonial style but it felt tired. I had just come from the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok - so I wasn't really prepared for it. Colonial here means an excuse not to remedy defects in the room, I am sorry but you don't pay hard earned money for anything that isn't up to scratch. The hotel occupies a large area, at the time of construction it was built out horizontally rather than the vertical dimensions of the modern constructions which is why it is a novelty. It is so much a symbol of opulence in Singapore you get the distinct feeling that staff feel that it is your honour to be there rather than their honour to serve you. There was no specific incident to suggest that but you do feel it. My attitude is I am paying money so please understand that without travellers like me you don't have a job..... Breakfast was included in the room rate and there was a mix-up which meant we saw people arriving after us getting served. There was a nice apology but still it doesn't feel nice to ask where your food is. We had drinks at the famous Long Bar there were two complimentary singapore slings and there are monkey nuts in bags so you crack them open and throw the husks on the floor - alot of fun! There is an arcade with alot of nice shops in the hotel complex and a mall which is adjacent. Just a tip for those who are visiting for a short time - do the night safari, it is amazing. Taxis are cheap in Singapore so just get a taxi out there. Overall, I must say that the experience was mildly disappointing and when I go again I wouldn't waste my money here. If you do want to come here to say you stayed at Raffles then book in advance on their website - I believe there is a 30 and 60 day advance purchase rate which has free breakfast and is much cheaper than closer to your travel dates. Again do not expect upgrades here, take the hotel for what it is - a landmark and don't expect a great deal more.", "Date": "July 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cpricey but worth it\u201d", "Author": "DCtravler244", "ReviewID": "UR35807908", "Content": "My husband and I spent two nights at Raffles.

We were siting in the Courtyard bar and ordered a Tiger beer from the tap. The barman looked at us and seeing us watching him poured a normal beer from the tap. Then, however, somebody siting at the tables at the Courtyard ordered a jug. In front of our eyes the barman then took one-quarter-full jug from the refigerator (somebody had obviously not finished his previously), added some beer from tap, then quite a lot of water and send it to the table. And that all in front of the eyes of the people siting at the bar! After a while there was another request from the tables. Barman took a jug, poured some beer from tap, then some water then a bit more beer and then another part of water and sent it away. We were absolutely dismayed. That seems to be regular practice there and it is obviously encouraged by the management. I have never seen it before in my life in any other 5 star hotels.

The suite had a small sitting room with a dining room table and couch, a nice bedroom with two twin beds and desk, and a very large bathroom. Not sure what distinguished this Personality Suite from other nearby rooms. They did not look much different. But, never-the-less, the suite was very nicely furnished with the size and quality of the bathroom a pleasant surprise. Importantly, the air conditioning was up to the task of keeping the room cool. What separates this hotel from the others, however, is the common areas, especially the lobby. They are just spectacular. And while the hotel is often listed as one of Singapore's top ten sites to see, the number of tourists in the lobby was not intrusive. The free breakfast was a great way to start the day and offered a very good selection. Service was excellent, especially from Serene, who, by day two, knew what kind of tea we wanted and what kind of sugar we preferred! Ate dinner at Raffles Grill, Seah Street Deli and the Longbar Steakhouse. The Deli was over priced and disappointing, the steakhouse was OK and not close to what most would consider a steakhouse, and the Grill was excellent; very expensive, but well worth it. The service throughout the hotel was excellent, from the stylish doorman to the concierge.

When we arrived we were warmly greeted and were taken into the lobby area whilst tea was ordered for us. Within a quarter of an hour we were shown to our suite, which was more like a mini apartment, it was beautiful, and just along from the Ava Gardener suite!! The front part was a living area complete with dining table, sofa and tv, you then go through to the large bedroom area where there are also a couple of armchairs. The bathroom was divided into two rooms, one with basins and dressing area and the other with bath, shower etc., all beautifully furnished. The first afternoon we went to the Long Bar, which we had already done on our first visit to Singapore, but just felt that we had to start with the Singapore Slings again! The hotel is very large and there is alot to see if you haven't been before, like the museum shop upstairs, and then it's just so nice to wander around soaking up the atmosphere. When you go in through the front door and into the lobby area it is really stunning, I really felt transported back in time. In the evening we were so confused as to which restaurant to choose as there are quite a few, so in the end went for Doc Chengs upstairs - it was very nice and certainly different with superb food. The next morning we decided to have breakfast by the pool (as recommended by a previous trip advisor) and it was wonderful as we were the only 2 eating there! The second evening we decided to eat in the Deli Restaurant on the ground floor, which was more American diner type food - we chose this as we had just spent 2 weeks in Bali eating a lot of very rich food! It made a nice change and there was a good buzzy atmosphere. Our last morning we opted for room service for breakfast.....wow, there was everything you could have wished for: porridge with banana on top, cereal, croissants, toast, fresh fruit, full English breakfast, a nice pot of tea and freshly made coffee! And our butlers who brought it in laid up our table beautifully and were so friendly. What utter luxury - we loved it! As we weren't leaving until late that day we were offered the health suite and pool to use in the afternoon which was a nice way to end our stay there, as we weren't pushed out. I feel it certainly is a wonderful experience to stay there, yes I know there are more modern luxury hotels in Singapore.....but if you want to taste a little bit of a bygone era, in perhaps the most beautiful building in Singapore then it has to be Raffles! You must also remember that you are staying in one of the top tourist sites so when you come out of the sanctuary of your apartment, you are in with all the tourists, so obviously the staff aren't always going to remember you, but when they realise that you are guests, then we were treated with the utmost courtesy.

Everyone told me how great the hotel was and I would be pampered. However, I was extremely disappointed and upset with the service. Let me list out my underwhelming experience: 1) We called the hotel in advance about our late check-in around 11:30pm. When we arrived there, nobody helped us get off the taxi, nobody carried our bags, nobody opened the doors. In fact we couldn't find a staff to help us check-in. We did manage to check-in after 10min of wandering 2) Next morning we ordered breakfast in our room, they didn't give us what we ordered and frankly the staff seemed pretty unfamiliar with the menu 3) Every time we pressed the \"butler button\" in our room, front desk called and asked what we needed. I said I would like to see my butler then the butler showed up after 15min. If the front desk called every time I pressed the button then what's the point of having the \"butler button\" in the room? I was told there were three shifts of butlers to serve us but I kept seeing different people in each shift. Butler didn't leave us he/she contact so when we were out we couldn't get him/her to make arrangements for us. These things totally defeated the purpose of a butler 4) We wanted to check out the hotel facilities and entered through the main lobby. A hotel manager stopped us because we didn't have proper dress code unless we were hotel guests. That's fine so I told him I was their hotel guest. He just shrugged his shoulders and did not apologize or at least say \"good morning, sir\". Completely rude! 5) We left a note on the fruit plate about what fruits we wanted for that evening. When we got back at night, fruit plate was not replenished and the note was still there. 6) Drinking glass was broken on my bed side table 7) Toilet supplies were not refilled 8) It finally went beyond my tolerance and I told the butler what happened and demanded an apology from the hotel manager when we check-out next morning 9) When we were carrying our bags to the lobby to check-out, a staff was moving furniture and we were both trying to get through a tight corner from opposite directions. The staff didn't give way and I actually got hit by the furniture he's moving 10) Hotel manager sounded very nice and apologetic and wrote down everything I was not happy with like 1) - 9) mentioned above. He said he would follow up with me shortly. We traveled on the Mar 21 weekend and I really thought it was a one-off and didn't want to publicize my poor experience. Three weeks have gone by and they haven't followed up. I guess they don't care... To be fair, the building, facilities and decoration are absolutely gorgeous. It was really one of the best in the region. Some of the events above may be one-off's and I can accept that but some of them are very substandard as a 5-star hotel and a combination of errors is really not acceptable. I booked through a discount hotel website may be that's why I didn't get the best out of them. People have different travel preferences, I enjoy more on personal experience and hotel service with attention to details really makes a difference.

Upon returning I was checked in and given the appropriate tours of the facilities including my room, the hotel, the spa, and surrounding grounds. Accommodations: Four nights in a Palm Court Suite. If you want slick, high-tech, and pure luxury I\u2019m sure there are superior hotels in the city. If you want understated colonial class where the floors creak a little bit (in a good way) and the faucets squeak (ditto) then this is your place. Needless to say I prefer the latter and was not disappointed. The adjoining facilities are nice as well, both the Amrita Spa and rooftop pool (a MUST) were top-notch. Dining: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll find a hotel in the world with more options (18 restaurants). I ate at the Raffles Grill and Longbar Steakhouse which were both above average. Room service is excellent. I had breakfast a couple mornings outside my suite overlooking the Palm Court (another must) and dinner one night as well. Location: Central and about a 5-10 minute walk to City Hall MRT. One of the negatives to its central location (and historical legacy) is that everyone and their cousin is peeking in the front entryway to take a look at the entrance and take a picture. Service: The butler service is great, as is the room service. You want to eat steak at 11:00PM while taking a swim on the rooftop pool and watch the world unfold? Please indulge. Politeness is the watchword here. Cost: All of the above obviously comes at a cost. Overpriced? Probably. As many reviewers have noted this hotel is about twice the cost of most of the others in the city. I think you are paying more than anything for the rooms and history here, as well as the privilege (yes that may sound weird) of staying at one of the most famous historic hotels in the world . It all depends on where your priorities are I guess. Convertible BMW or a few nights at a place like this?

I had booked a courtyard suite but asked if I wanted a Palm court suite at extra cost but with tiffen thrown in. We where shown to the Somerset Maugham suite, The largest suite we had ever stayed in and it lived up to the Raffles image. It was so quite it was hard to believe we was in the middle of a city. The two night stay was perfect everything as it should be. At the end of our stay we ask for the Raffles car to take us back to the airport. Yes it is expensive.

Our first meal was local delicacies and was okay though the restaurant was pretty empty and had no atmosphere. The price of wine was very high - food costs reasonable. We then found our way to the Long Bar where we ordered the signature cocktail, Singapore Sling - very disappointing in that it was pre-mixed and the barman just added some ice cubes - at 32 sd very disappointing. We took breakfast the next day in the pool bar and the guy who runs the pool bar was the best thing in the hotel - he was attentive, friendly and yet discreet. We asked our butler (who arrived after pressing call bell and finally resorting to calling reception on the phone) various questions about the hotel - she seemed not to know the layout at all and we were certainly not offered a tour nor run baths or taken to the Long Bar for complimentary drink as other reviewers have stated. Whilst the staff were very friendly we certainly were not made to feel 'special' and they certainly did not know our names. The Tiffin Room's curry buffet was awful.

We stayed for four nights. Major problem with room made a mess of our first night. We booked a Palm Court room (checked chain of emails from the agent to verify). We arrived and were shown to one of the \"personality suites\" in a courtyard location (Ava Gardner). Whether it was the right level or not was academic, it was uninhabitable because of lacquer fumes. We asked to be moved before the front desk left the room and were shown to an adequate, but unimpressive courtyard room facing a busy street which had 24 hr construction activity. Had a very bad night. Went down the next night, and were finally shown to a Palm Court room which was extremely nice. Lovely outlook, quiet area and very nice fit out. Take your own iPod and speakers. In subsequent discussions with the front desk we discovered that there was a room adjoining the Ava Gardiner which was being renovated which was the cause of the fumes and that they had left four rooms vacant to deal with it. Clearly they needed to leave an extra one. Overall service was good. Enthusiastic if not skillful. I think our description was \"cheerfully incompetent\". There were, however, some very nice moments. For instance, we were in the habit of having a pre-dinner drink on the balcony with friends, and when they noticed we were using the bar fridge Pringles as nibbles, the next night they were replaced be a small selection of nibbles laid out as our wine was brought. Hand written notes of apology for the room debacle. Dinner in the Grill was superb. The sommelier was exceptional and has a great wine list to work with. High tea in the Tiffin room was lovely and breakfast was nice. Singapore Slings in the Long Bar were much better than expected! The pool was lovely and relatively quiet (about 24 sun beds, but never full, chlorine levels were tropically strong!). The spa was nice with several treatments much approved of by my other half.

Service excellent, staff fantastic. Book the hotel limo through the hotel and you fast track immigration, a guy waitng for you as you disembark the plane. (but to be fair, most top end hotels in asia offer that). The scale of oppulance and beauty is second to none at Raffles, and although i enjoyed the experience it i did feel like a tourist attraction myself whilst staying at the hotel. The hotel does attract many tourists, and i have to admit that i aalso once visited the hotel for a drink on a previous trip!! The rooms are very colonial and old and very beautiful. The lack of Flat screens etc didn't bother me. Go elsewhere if you want modern hi tech. However, what did slighty irk me was the condition of the room. I appreciate its an old building and the design may not attract that much light into the rooms ( palm or courtyard rooms have small seating area when enetring, before walking through a curtain into bedroom) but the room i was in could have benefited from a lick of paint. Staining and disclouration around door handles and walls from previous guests, rust on the ceiling speakers. Also, the blue curtain separating the entrance sitting/dining area was really frayed and rather tatty, it most ceratinly had seen better days. The other issue that concerned me was the lack of bottled water. Yes, i know that you can drink the water from the tap at Raffles, but filling my glass up with water from the bathroom just didn't feel classy. The staff filled your silver jug of water from the tap on an evening, but i just personally felt i would have liked a bottle by my bedside table. Pool area small, but nice and quiet, and also a less formal alternative to the more formal breakfasts at the tiffin room. Go try Raffles for yourself, you only live once, just don't get too caught up in the spin. Let yourself be the judge of any hotel and not simply the price or other peoples comments. Its a great place, but maybe not for everyone. Five stars ,yes, but for me, im not sure if i would return. That doesn't mean that people who do are wrong or that i'm right, just that hotels are very personal, and even when you are staying in one of the top hotels in the world doesn't mean you always want to return. Thank you for the experience Raffles you were great, but been there, seen it, done it comes to mind which puzzles me as i never get that feeling with say, the oriental in Bangkok or the aman resorts.

We buzzed him from the room and within 5 mins he appeared to take us on the tour. This was not a rushed \"lets get rid of the tourists asap\" but a really informative enjoyable half an hour. We loved having our Slings in the Long bar - For the traveller who made the comments about \"a carpet of peanuts\" - THATS WHATS ITS KNOWN FOR - its part of the charm. We felt quite decadent sipping our drinks and throwing our shells on the floor. And chucking them on the carpet back home would NOT be quite the same. As a resident you do feel priviledged to have one of the magic keys which let you into every part of the hotel. Tourists are not allowed into the reception unless they are staying there. The hotel is beautiful - and in keeping with its era - so don't expect contemporary modern furnishing. Expect beautiful antiques, gorgeous displays of flowers and crystal chandeliers ! It really is like stepping back 100 years. The bedrooms are in keeping with this - even the TV is stored in a old TV cabinet. We loved the double sinks in the bathrooms. And they are well stocked with every toiletry you would need. When we returned to our room we found they had strewn the bedroom and bathroom with petals and the chef had prepared a bowl of Chocolate dipped strawberrys and a bottle of bubbly - accompanied with a lovely handwritten note from our Butler We loved breakfast in Tiffins - lovely food and beautiful service. Singapore itself is amazing. You can eat very cheaply and very well. Drinks are comparable with the UK. Shopping is out of this world - but haggle especially for electronic goods. Try Luckys mall for gaming/electronics. Men prepare your credit cards as the clothes shopping is unbelieveable ! Do not travel to Raffles expecting it to be cheap - that would be like expecting the Savoy in London to charge \u00a3 20 per night - its not going to happen. Go to Raffles expecting a once in a life time experience and jump back to an era pre PSP's and Nintendo Wii's !", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen", "Title": "\u201cRaffles is a must try\u201d", "Author": "Pindsvineparret", "ReviewID": "UR17002843", "Content": "When in Singapore a stay at the Raffles is a must.

From the moment you step from the car you feel welcome. No need to scrabble around in your pockets for passports etc.; check-in is in your suite; once that's done, your luggage will have rejoined you and it's time to relax. As many reviews have already said, there is a feeling of history and timeless elegance about the place; and despite being in the middle of a busy part of town, within the hotel grounds there is a feeling of tranquility. Although it is a prominent landmark in the city, they have been very careful to strictly limit non-resident access to the majority of the grounds and we were surprised how few other guests we encountered when not in the restaurants or bar area, despite the hotel being quite full. The staff are incredibly attentive, helpful and polite; nothing is too much trouble. There is a rooftop pool and an adjacent gym (small) and spa. The pool and gym are open 24 hours. The spa is not state of the art; but it would be incongruous if it was. Instead the therapists rely on their skills which are superb. The Raffles Hotel Plaza is also worth a look around. We had suits made at Coloc on the 2nd floor (=1st floor UK) and highly recommend it for service, price and quality. If I really had to nit pick, these are my criticisms 1) the Tiffin Indian restaurant (which we visited last time) was disappointing. The food is buffet style, in rich sauces, and was not as tasty as the smells eminating from the restaurant would suggest 2) The Courtyard restaurant is lovely (particularly recommended is the Singapore chilli crab) but in the evening there is a singer crooning Sinatra-esque ballads.

Everything about this hotel is first class, you are absolutely treated like royalty from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. The period suite was a gem, seperate 'parlour' with dining area, comfy chairs and writing desk. Forget sending postcards, send letters using the Raffles retro stationary. The butlers call button in the parlour (I kid you not) was answered within 5 minutes and the delightful staff attentively dealt with any request.

The absolutely superb piano playing and occasional gospel singing by 'Jimmy' which echoed around the restauraunt was an absolute delight.

We did venture out to Long Beach for some tasty Black Pepper Crab but apart from that and a visit to the excellent Mall across from Raffles, we hardly left the hotel. Had a couples exfoliation/steam/jacuzzi & massage in the Spa which was a very romantic affair and was similarly priced to the Chedi.

You cannot fault the location, the scale and quality of the rooms, but when it comes to service standards have really dropped. A nice touch had always been the \"welcome back to Raffles\" note. I know it's out of a database, but this time they slipped up and assume it was our first visit. This clearly had our valet flustered from the outset. The bar in the room was warm. A request to have it fixed was meant to get it sorted but the only obvious difference was that the door stuck - still luke warm beverages. On the first morning it took three requests to get coffee at breakfast, two requests to get juices delivered (and the wrong ones turned up anyway) and napkins arrived only as an afterthought. On return to our room re pressed the service button to request that a garment be pressed. After 30 minutes I gave up and called the front desk. No activity for 10 minutes so I called again and asked if this was \"normal\". The final straw was at 17.00 on the first day when the key to our room failed and we got locked out. The problem was met with nonchalance. At this point I called the duty manager and he accepted that there were shortcomings. He offered us a free meal as recompense and managed to get the fridge changed. Next morning at 5.30 am our doorbell was rung by the concierge staff. I woke but did not respond. Following a scuffling of feet noises were then heard from above - it was clear they had gone to the wrong floor. Later that afternoon my wife was in the bath. I was sitting in my boxers and the bell rang again and the door was swiftly opened from the outside - a maid going to the wrong room! The hotel is a delightful building but is a tourist trap. It's overrun with camera happy snappers and this rubs off on the staff who are off hand and disinterested.

Recently, on 10th February 2007, I attended a masterclass by 2 Michelin Star Chef Thierry Marx as part of Raffles Hotel's Annual Wine, Food & Arts Experience. Raffles is the grande dame of Asia and is 120 years old this year. I learned how to cook Mousse Chou-Fleur-Ang which is cauliflower mousse inside a chicken fillet rolled up like cigars and deep fried. It is enjoyed dipped into cauliflower mousse spiked with passion fruit and fizzy Espumas. Next, came his signature dish of Risotto de Soja Aux Truffles which has NO Arborio rice at all. Instead, we have bean sprouts! They are cut to resemble rice grains, and then made in to a \"risotto\" with mushrooms, cream, white wine, shallots, Mascarpone cheese plus diced oysters brunoise. Topped with thin sliced black truffles, it was the most unusual \"risotto\" I had ever tasted. For a sweet finish, I learned how to make dessert of Gingerbread & Candied Sweet Potato, Potimarron Squash Ice Cream and Bitter Cocoa Flakes. First came the gingerbread with honey and grated orange zest for that aromatic flavour, then the ice cream was concocted with sweet potato, butter, sugar and milk. Finally, sweet potato sliced thinly was soaked in sugar syrup. Et voila! Over lunch with Chef Thierry with Mischief & Mayhem 2005 Pinot Noir from Burgundy, we exchanged culinary experiences. I was startled to learn that 42 year old Thierry is a vegetarian. A lot of 1, 2 and 3 Michelin Star Chefs like Paul Bocuse and Philippe Legendre are my good friends, and it is the first time I have met a Michelin starred chef who is a vegetarian. I asked him, \u201cWhat is the strongest influence on your cuisine?\u201d Thierry replied without hesitation, \u201cJapanese Kaiseki Ryori cuisine from my 3 years in Japan.\u201d As wine is always close to my heart, I enquired, \u201cWhat is your favourite wine?\u201d He came up with a politically correct answer, \u201cChateau Lynch-Bages.\u201d You see, Thierry\u2019s restaurant is located in Chateau Cordeillan-Bages in the Chateau Lynch-Bages estate in Pauillac. \u201cChampagne?\u201d Chef Thierry said, \u201cBollinger and Salon..\u201d On the subject of the coveted Michelin Stars which has even driven Chefs to suicide, I probed gently, \u201cHow did you feel when you got your first \u201cmacaron\u201d? Thierry was frank and open when he explained, \u201cI was happy\u2026but I live for cooking\u2026not Michelin Stars.\u201d His cuisine aims to let diners experience differences in textures, temperatures and tastes. To those more used to \u201ccuisine traditionelle\u201d, his eclectic style may be radical and unconventional. However, I would advise those who want to be critical to be careful.

Seating was comfortable and multiple period pieces of Chinese objet d'art placed around the room. Whilst in no way gaudy, compared with staying in all-too-common 5 star modern hotel rooms with plain furnishings, carpeting, glass and marble, the Raffles felt like staying at a home.

You must stay here once in your life!!! Having spent many nights in the best hotels in the world I have to say that this is easily now in my top three. My wife and I spent our honeymoon here recently and were treated like royalty from the minute we arrived until the minute we departed for the airport in the hotel's very own Bentley Continental The food options at the hotel are vast and varied from a funky american style diner to more exclusive jacket and tie fare. Charmingly old and traditional the hotel really has a warmth about it and the staff are extremely attentive and proffesional The Queen recently stayed there and we had the pleasure of meeting the guest services manager called Terrance (he served the Queen personally when she was in residence) who made our stay that little more special after we requested a few little tweaks to the stay, including the Bentley back to the airport (you simply have to do this if you want to arrive their in comfort) The city itself is amazing but we found ourselves spending most of the time in the vast grounds of the hotel and drinking Singapore Slings long into the afternoon in the long bar surrounded by monkey nut shells (we all have a bit of tourist in us don't we?) The rooms were spacious and the beds extremely comfortable. Each room has its own bellboy who arrives in seconds of the push of a button. We rarely used him but when we needed to the service was world class. Nothing wasan issue for any of the staff. Prices are extremely reasonable compared with the UK's top hotels, but then you don't come to Raffles to have a cheap meal and a three pound bottle of red wine.

Stayed for 3 nights in a palm court suite towards the end of November 05. Check in was a breeze and i found the staff INCREDIBLY friendly. You are led through the RESIDENTS only gate, across the palm court to a simply ENOURMOUS suite. Very colonial with fabulous toiletries, nice welcome letter, fruit platter etc. Breakfast (which we got included in the rate) is very nice and one day we chose to have it by the pool (at extra cost) this was simply devine and the attendant s attitude was one of the best i have ever come across (little things like changing my partners coffee cafitiere instead of just topping it up) we even saw him a couple of days later in the lobby and he came over had a chat even remembered our names. Infact we had a few occasions where we were greeted by name. Room service was incredibly quick and one day we had afternoon Tea on the verandah outside our room, very peaceful and hard to believe we were only a few feet away from a busy main road I know a few people have concerns that the hotel is overun with tourist but the lobby is residents only after 9pm and only guest can access certain parts of the hotel. We certainly did not find this a problem. The long bar is busy but this adds to the vibe. All in all, this hotel is one of my most favorite i have ever stayed in. Yes its expensive but they treat you fabulously, service is magnificent and the rooms are huge. Would stay again in a heartbeat.

Tom, the manager learned only that morning that we're on a honeymoon trip. We didn't expect anything from him and he didn't tell either. We went out for dinner in the evening and when we're back, he's got us a big surprise. We open the door to our suite to discover it filled with a relaxing aroma and romantic music. The bed was not only made but covered with rose petals with patterns and a pair of toy teddies and a large plate of choco strawberries. We thought that's it only to discover that rose petal bubble bath, with water still hot and candles still lit, had already been set in the bathroom.

We stayed here for 1 day & night as our first stop out to our honeymoon in Australia. This hotel really is top notch in terms of service, attentiveness, and quality. The main intrigue when you get there comes from the colonial heritage of the place, it's history and the way it is laid out. Overall, it occupies a much larger area of land than you would expect - the hotel is more like an estate, it's low-rise and you can get a bit lost wandering around the shopping area and mall-facing side of the hotel grounds. Because of the open-air nature of the Raffles grounds, you find it impossible to escape the humidity - if you are not used to it (like us). We were provied with a room in a wing of the hotel which is across an area of the open lawn to the right of the main building, so we simply had to expose ourselves to the backdripping humidity simply to get to breakfast. However, breakfast here is worth sweating over; an array of food of such diversity and detail it's extraordinary to think they provide it every day. What you are paying for and getting with this hotel is quality of both the service, and everything you come into contact with while here. The room was certainly special in terms of size, facilities and quality of finishes. The thing is, it is pretty impossible to occupy yourself for any decent length of time within this hotel in order to escape from the humidity as all the rear grounds and buildings are open-air. This factor can be limiting to your ability to refresh if you are travelling onwards. However, they do have a great bar and steak restaraunt lining the piazza and gardens. However, if you are looking for total relaxation and pampering where you don't have to spend all your time going between the extremes of climate (control), then I would strongly recommend the Valley Wing Deluxe City view at the Shangri La instead, which is cheaper, has a great pool, and is even more attentive - as it doesn't have to deal with non-resident visitors.

It was totally unexpected and overwhelming and for a while we dare not touch anything in case there had been a mistake! But the personal letter with fruit basket from the management confirmed we were booked into this suite. Our personal valet, on call 24 hours did a sterling job showing us around the suite. On a more down to earth level, the front desk/concierge were very helpful and gracious. However, the service in the restaurants, especially the Tiffin Room at breakfast was erratic and the meal we had in the Long Bar Steakhouse was disappointing. And as other reviews have mentioned the \"Singapore Sling experience\" lacked romance! The areas soley for \"residents\" are stunningly furnished and very comfortable and it is true that one gets a slightly smug feeling being able to cross the \"residents only threshold\" and leave the gawping tourists behind! The hotel complex was much larger than imagined and the array of restaurants, bars and shops is very impressive and the courtyard cafe and bar areas a very pleasant spot to spend a warm evening.
