They are VERY isolated so a car or plenty of spare $$$ for taxi is required.

That phrase (though wordy) sums up this place perfectly. Not going to spend a lot of time on things like lobby (who cares) or location (it is really in the middle of nowhere - end of a pathetic 'island'). In sum, this place has no business attempting to pass itself off as a resort. In my opinion, it is misleading and false advertising. From other reviews, it sounds like this place was good in it heyday. Sadly, those days are long gone. At best, this is a fancy Motel, like a step above Motel 6. Let's call it Motel 6.20. If I had to sum up the room in a single word, it would be 'dump'! Old and outdated are the least of its problems. After you drive your car around to the building where your room is allegedly located (yes, think HoJo style here), you enter a semi-enclosed structure. There is no signage or other direction to indicate if you are in the right place. It is simply trial and error to find your assigned roon. After getting on the elevator for the short trip to the second floor, I had to avert my eyes from the filthy carpet in the elevator. Upon entering the room, the stench is the first thing to greet you. After that, it is all downhill. Walk past the tube TV and you encounter a terribly sagging, U-shaped bed, as well as similarly shaped desk chair (and, oh yeah, the chair cushions are stained as a nice bonus). The beds are abysmal. During the night, I was fully expecting a spring to pop up through the mattress and impale me. Also, you better really like the person you are sleeping with because the laws of gravity, along with the terrible beds at this place, will guarantee that you spend the entire night - like it or not - attached to them. There is simply no escaping the valley of the U mattress. For the most part, the rooms appear clean, but do not be fooled! For a clean freak like me, it is notable to point out some very major deviations in this regard. First, the bedspread...yes, you read that correctly - they still use bedspreads. As all of the 20/20 and other investigative interviews have revealed, a hotel bedspread should essentially be burned immediately since they are so nasty. Not at kona koni....instead, there, they take the bedspread and cover the entire bed, pillows included. So....your pillow is tainted with bedspread nastiness from the get go. After you muster up the courage to remove the bedspread, an equally nasty and worn \"velvet blanket\" is revealed. As anyone born before 1976 can confirm, these are those nasty velvet things that pill and get gross with each washing. I thought they were banished from the face of the earth, but fear not - you can find a full supply at this Motel. At this property, you have an added bonus - they contain the hairs (head as well as hairs from other body parts) of prior guests. This all sets the stage for a great night's sleep. Speaking of sleep, good luck. First, the pillows; or, rather, the \"pillows\". These are nothing more than pillow cases stuffed with a layer or 2 of miscellaneous stuff. I call them \"pancake pillows\" That is about how thick they are. Second, no need for an alarm clock if one of your neighbors rises riser earlier than you. When a neighbor showers, it feels like you are in the middle of the pipes where the water is running through. While I did not hear the actual guests talking, I could tell when they showered or washed their hands. The sound is so loud you feel like you're in the middle of a waterfall. Third, the lovely holes in the towels are really nice. Enough said. Fourth, if you are handicapped - or get put in a handicapped room - good luck in the bathroom. Apparently, at the Kona Kai, physically challenged people don't have needs for shelves or cabinets or counter space in a bathroom. I had an accessible room. The only place to put my toiletry bag was on the shower chair that is used for disabled people. Fifth, the heating/AC unit. It is at ankle length and appears to emit only one temperature regardless of its setting. Sixth, outlets. They are original from 70's or 80's - be prepared to get creative in getting your electronic device to stay plugged in. The outlets are so old that they barely hold any charger. Also, as an added bonus, they are all about ankle high and out of the way. This is a business traveler's nightmare. Speaking of business travelers, they claim free internet. Well, you get what you pay for. In the common areas, it works well. In the rooms (where you probably need it the most) it is slow and unreliable. This place advertises a spa. There was a flyer attached to the key jacket that boasted a \"neck, shoulder, back, foot and leg massage\" for $70, usually $90. This type of massage you can get at major airports for $20 bucks. This is not a real massage or a real spa. In any event, you will need a whole lot more than a half-baked massage after a stay at this Motel (I am even being kind calling it a motel). They should throw in a free week's worth of chiropractic treatments after suffering 1 or more nights at this place. Service at the bar was good....once the bartender showed up. Warning....her martini doesn't taste like it, but it is quite lethal ;) Restaurant....service and food delivery were rushed. However, when you wanted a refill on wine you had to set yourself on fire to be noticed by the waitstaff. Food, at best, was mediocre. Bar and restaurant close at 10 on Friday and Saturday nights....really????!!! Suffice it to say..this place is so bad that I would sooner stay in my car than stay here for the night.

The standalone cabinet in the bathroom was so worn the paint was coming off and corners were rounded down, it looked to be about 25 years old.

Parking ($15 a night fee) is between the hotel and the street, and note that the outdoor seating area for many of the standard rooms face the parking lot. The grounds and plantings were well maintained. Check-in was efficient and the room easy to find.

Carpeting and furnishings were in good shape, although some of the wallpaper in the bathroom was beginning to peel. King bed was comfortable, but not very substantial so that any movement on the bed caused it to shake. The room had a mini-fridge but no coffee maker (a cup of coffee in the restaurant to go was $3). Free wifi worked well. Use of hotel gym was $10/day per person (better off driving 10 minutes to a real gym and spending $15). There was a small 'beach' area facing the marina on the back side of the property, but even if you could swim there, you wouldn't want to with such close proximity to boats and related pollution.

They had a nice gym & bike rental area, and it was very relaxing to just stroll around the hotel, since it's right on the sand. The best part of the hotel, in our opinion, was the restaurant. We are the quiet type, so we were delighted to have dinner mostly to ourselves at the beautiful restraunt with the ocean view. We also got a free breakfast that was included in our stay in the morning (there was only a few other people that time as well). The food was great and the venue was high class.

More than one night is probably too much though.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medina, Wa", "Title": "\u201cGreat place if you are a sailor, otherwise look elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "travlinman36", "ReviewID": "UR123323930", "Content": "Long ago, in a very different life, I spent 2 glorious years aboard the USS Will Rogers, the ultimate Polaris submarine.

From the point of view of the individual guest, the KK has seen better days. Specifically, the carpet of the first room to which I was assigned was soaking wet, sopping wet. Upon notifying the front desk of the problem we were immediately moved to a similar room with a dry carpet. The rest of the room was just fine. Comfortable beds, good shower, plenty of space, nice balcony with view of the marina. But, the entire property shows its age. And the restaurant is mediocre and pricey.

It doesn't strike me as a place people are actively looking to book. So my review is structured to help people who might be \"stuck\" in a stay at the Kona Kai and my tips to make it tolerable. I had stayed on Shelter Island before the the location can't be beat. It is slightly secluded but very close to downtown San Diego. I guess in the 60's it was known as \"Poor Man's Hawaii\" and maintains a very cool tropical vibe and beautifully planted grounds and parks. It has a marina on one side and a view of the bay on the other. I bid on a hotel with three stars in Shelter Island for 70 dollars a night and Kona Kai picked it up. When we got there I was prepared to be zinged by the 15 dollar a night parking fee, but bantered back and forth with the staff and got it lowered to eight dollars a night. That said, there is nothing special about the parking, except that it's annoying to have to swipe your card a million times on their semi defective security gate to get it open. I cruised around trying to figure out where else we could park and if we were alone (we were traveling with two kids) we would of parked in the park parking lot across the street overnight. That behind us, we headed to our room and were struck by the marine smell it had (some would call it musty) but otherwise it seemed clean and fairly spacious. We went out to eat and when we got back to room we discovered our heater went out. We tried to get it back on (it is a window unit) but to no avail. We informed the front desk that we had no heat, and I was surprised that this didn't even seemed surprising to them. They said that if two rooms next to each other are running the window units at the same time one often goes out. They offered to move us immediately or the next morning. We were exhausted and it wasn't too cold in the room, so we decided to move in the morning. IMPORTANT: Bring your own pillow. The pillows they have are the equivalent of a piece of kleenex. Flat and tiny. I had come prepared with my own pillow and even my 3 year old's were fighting over who got to use it. The beds were lumpy. I suggest getting a room with two doubles. Two adults on one bed is sure to have someone sinking ot the center. IMPORTANT: Bring earplugs, as the walls are paper thin. I could hear the 4 am coversation next door word for word. I was pretty sure they were complaining about their room. So that night was pretty brutal, but the next three nights we were moved to a third floor room in what seemed like a slightly newer part of the hotel. IMPORTANT: Try to get a third floor room. This room had elevator access (the previous room did not), it was newer -- no marine smell, no peeling paint, or lumpy beds. It was much quieter. So if you get a third floor room in the newer building you are going to have a nice stay. Not amazing or great, but nice enough. The things to enjoy about Kona Kai are the views, the clean rooms, the fairly pleasent staff, the grounds, especially the pool area. Things you will find annoying: the laundry area that is a pretty long trek from the hotel, the possibly rabid raccoon that lives in the palm tree by the pool and washes its feet in the water every ten minutes and eats out of the garbage can, and the very severe prison shower head, and the credit card attachment on the \"house computer\" that charges you for using it. Things that you should try to avoid at all costs: Staying in a first or second floor room in the older part of the hotel. I think this hotel would be amazing if they did a renovation. But until then, it just is barely tolerable.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Littleton, Colorado, United States", "Title": "\u201cSome Great, Some not so much...\u201d", "Author": "Tomincolorado", "ReviewID": "UR122230839", "Content": "We stayed at the Kona Kai 3 nights, the 25th - 27th the first night, Christmas night, we checked in at 1:30 am.

Made my reservation through Travelocity's Top Secret Hotels for a 45% discount. The Pop Secret deal is a gimmick that mimics Priceline/Hotwire, but, lets you know the price. Pop Secret gives you the general area, often with too broad of a brush stroke, and several guest ratings of property categories. If you can toggle to/fro the Pop Secret property review and the regular Travelocity review screen, you can get an idea of the candidate hotel. I was able to narrow down my guess to two hotels on Shelter Island, a perfect location for my needs. Within a minute of my placing my reservation for the Secret Hotel, the dramatic news was emailed to me that my winning selection was Kona Kai. What an exciting drama! My stay at Kona Kai was without drama. Just how I like it. My hotel needs are: 1. Location 2. Firm/clean/comfy bed 3. Hot shower 4. Coffee within crawling distance in the morning 5. If staff treats me well, that is a bonus Kona Kai met and exceeded my five needs. I was greeted and treated well. As several have stated, the hallways and other decor is a bit dated, but, I don't care about carpet, wall paper and wall sconces. My room was a clean, 2 queen bed with a desk and a double door armoir for clothing storage. Fast wi-fi internet is free throughout the property. Coffee maker was in the bathroom and for some, this may crowd the smallish 1 sink counter. Also, the bathroom lighting was a tad dim. My room had a nice view of the pool, grass courtyard and marina. Noticed a nice restaurant/bar with bayside and marina views, but, I'm not a fan of most hotel food. There are dozens of good restaurants within 1 mile. Their health club is an excellent facility, even at $15/day. I didn't work out, but, my tour of the club saw dozens of pieces of equipment and all in good condition. A free workout is a walk or run along Shelter Island's waterfront. Kona Kai also has bicycles for rent. Parking is $15 per night. But, the airport shuttle is free and it's a new, clean Toyota mini-van that starts at 05:30 and runs every half hour. Biggest downside of Kona Kai may be the thin walls in the rooms. I noticed some conversation next door when I first moved in. Lucky me, there was no noise at night. Maybe I should add that as a SIXTH hotel room requirement. My overall rating for Kona Kai is THREE out of 5 Hawaiian Leis. This ain't no Hyatt with 10,,000 thread count sheets. But, San Diego is very proud of their hotels with plenty of $200+ properties. At way less than $100, I will return to Kona Kai.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cAdequate and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Casualtyward", "ReviewID": "UR118875049", "Content": "I booked this place as a mystery hotel and was apprehensive when I read the reviews.

My overall first impression was that this was a fairly nice property. When I approached the front desk the attendant asked what she could do for me. No smile, no warm greetinge; she simply wanted to get to business. It was early in the morning, so I knew there was a good chance my room wouldn't be ready - and it wasn't. She instructed me to come back at a certain time when she would assign my room. I returned at the time she instructed, she said a room was not available and that I should come back in an hour. Once again I followed her instruction. This time when I arrived, she looked at me as though she'd never seen me and asked what I needed. I explained to her that she told me to come back to check in... At this point she said the room still wasn't ready, but she would go ahead and get the paperwork done so that I could come back in an hour and get my key. I agreed, and an hour later I received the key for my guest room. Upon entering my room I found it to be quite dated, with worn furnishings and stained cushions and carpet. The mirrors in the room were obviously not cleaned, evidenced by something smeared on them. When I phoned home, I sat on the bed and happened to look behind the nightstand where there was a dirty tissue from a previous guest, I assume. When I opened the closet I was pleased to find a mini refrigerator; a bit unexpected, but it was a good thing. Clothing is intended for the armoire/dresser. San Diego can be a bit warm, and this place does not offer central air. There is an old fashioned, rather loud, wall-unit air conditioner that protrudes out onto the lanai; which by the way is very nice with its patio table and chairs. The lighting in the bathroom is awful, as is the condition of the tub/shower, with its chips, stains, and mildew. There is a hairdryer and coffee maker, along with plenty of soap, shampoo, and lotion. Somehow my toothbrush didn't make it into my bag. I called the front desk to inquire as to where I could get one after 9:00 p.m. They said they would send one right over to my room. In less than ten minutes there was a knock on my door, and I had a colgate toothbrush and toothpaste. Now that's some good customer service! (I guess it's hit and miss depending upon who is working what shift.) The actual geography around the hotel is great. It's situated right on the water, so the immediate surroundings are lovely.

What we didn't expect was how perfect the location is for a quiet, family-friendly relaxation vacation. On one side is the private beach and marina, and on the other is the bay and a strip of public park that we didn't want to leave. We sat in the lawn chairs we brought and took our time with our little barbecue. The weather was perfect on July 2nd and 3rd. Shelter Island is a gem with a beautiful strip of public park space for boat and people watching along the bay. Even though it was very popular on the July 4th weekend (as expected), it was only on the 4th that it got crazy because locals stake out space early to watch the fireworks at 9pm. We got the package that included premium views and a breakfast and free parking. The room is the size of a balcony stateroom on a cruise ship, except the bathroom is larger. The balcony is small and hadn't been cleaned. Neither of these facts bothered us because we had a gorgeous view and a wonderful location (room 348). The staff was very friendly and helpful, with very few exceptions. The free breakfast is actually very nice, but limited (options include 2 eggs, a fritatta, a waffle, pancakes, and one other thing I think). We sat in the restaurant with a gorgeous view of the marina. They serve you coffee and leave the carafe. Spouse and I both ordered two eggs and bacon. He chose potatoes while I chose fruit. That's it. You don't get toast or juice or anything else. We didn't care. It was presented very nicely. Strangely, my eggs, ordered over easy, were really underdone. I had to send them back and ask for over medium. When the plate was returned, the whites were still a little liquidy and the second time the bacon was overdone. If you like over easy, I would order over hard. It was tasty enough, though. The fruit bowl was lovely. Strawberries, grapes, melon, and fresh pineapple. The parking gate is a little sticky. You need to keep the card in the slot a second and then it opens. We would return, but maybe ask for a newer room with a better bed. Or maybe return on July 4th and ask for a bay view room to watch the fireworks without having to stake a space in the park early in the morning. We didn't use the pool, though it was nice and not overcrowded. The pool and spa close at 10pm, keeping things quiet. I tried the spa but left after a family let their boy pee in it. They were speaking Spanish and assumed I didn't understand them. That's why I hate public spas--the behavior of one or two people who ruin it for everyone. We got massages and they were good and included the steam room and a shower. Restaurants in Point Loma are only a few miles away. One of four Miguels Mexican is right off the island. Great chips and the perfect \"real Mexican\" margaritas--just tequila, lime juice, and rocks.

We stayed for 5days/3nights with two kids under 3, and grandparents and enjoyed sitting on the balcony mornings/evenings watching the boats, helicopters and other water traffic on the bay. Room: Room and linens clean. Good size with balconies with view of bay--nice. Not all rooms have this view so if you want it, ask for it. The pillows were flat wafers and the beds are worn. The bathrooms are very small--squeeze between toilet and vanity to close the door to get into the shower. Each room has a refrigerator. There was no closet door on our closet, the bathroom door was splintering at the bottom from prior water damage, the floor tile was stained, and the bottom of the bathtub needed a thorough, aggressive scrubbing. The towels were clean but very thin. Facilities: Good size sparkling pool and jacuzzi. The pool towels are like kleenex so take your own or get several from the front desk. The play area is just a slide. We did not eat at the hotel or order room service. You will pay $15/night to park a vehicle. There is no elevator so if you want a room with a view you have to climb stairs. Service:The staff was functional but not overly friendly. There is no poolside bar/food service, room service trays were piled up in the downstairs hallway for at least 2 days (they were still there when we checked out---gross). Housekeeping was good but late in the day. A couple of times we returned from a morning out to find the rooms just as we'd left them. It is definitely not a destination resort.

We booked online with a third party and I admit I never did that before. I was assured by the third party if I upgraded my room I would get free breakfast everyday. When we arrived at the hotel I told them that and they said we were not getting breakfast and could not upgrade because it was booked third party. I don't know who was wrong but they didn't even try and work with us. When we were getting the room key I told them I wanted to stay in the free standing buildings not the older part of the hotel. She gave me the 2nd floor in the older part of the hotel. I said that wasn't what I wanted, she then gave me another key. When we went to the room we were on the first floor of the older part of the hotel...exactly what I did not want. The hallways to the rooms have scuffed walls, dim lighting and not nice smells. The room itself used to have beautiful bedcovers, pillow shams and decorator pillows...this time they made the bed with the bedcover turned down with no shams or nice pillows. The only pillows on each bed were about 2\" thick, together they didn't make a decent pillow. The place just seems to get more run down each year we go. The beds were junk, neither of us got a good nights sleep in the cheap mattresses. The outside had a lot of discoloration, could have been mold or rust. Inside the room we had to move furniture to find a place to plug in our computer and cell chargers. Lastly we had to pay $15 a night to park in an unsecure parking lot, they were working on the gates and they were constantly open.

I checked in with a young lady who seemed confused and seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. It took at least 20 minutes for her to locate my reservation once she found someone to help. After waiting 20 minutes, I was told the room was not ready. She asked me to have a seat until the room was ready. I waited almost 40 minutes in the lobby watching people come in and out getting room keys and not be acknowledged. Had I known it was going to take over an hour I would have left to enjoy the city since it was a nice Sunday afternoon. I asked if my room was ready and she looked aggravated that I was asking. I then asked to speak to a manager and she went somewhere in the back and came out and said the manager was in a meeting and not available. When I asked her to have the manager come speak to me after her meeting she said \"if she's still here, I'll have her come out.\" I continued to watch her give keys to other people and even watched a shift change in agents. Finally, I could not handle the frustration, I attempted to see the front desk again. I asked her again and she told me it would be 45 minutes. Im not one to complain but after seeing so many other people get rooms I had to say something. She apologized and said to have a seat and she would help me in a bit. 25 minutes later, I saw the young lady run off with her belongings to leave. I tried to remain patient after being so upset, when the new agent who arrived Crissy, saw me waiting. She asked if I was waiting on a room and I explained my situation about waiting and how the manager was surprisingly unavailable. Instead of waiting the 45 minutes, Crissy immediately found a room for me and even offered a full view room at no additional charge. She was very pleasant and friendly and a complete turnaround from the gal before her. Crissy had suggested a few things to do while in town and even had great suggestions on some sales for shopping. After speaking with her, I was really excited to go about my day and had forgotten about the negative experience I had first encountered. Later that night I encountered another issue when trying to order room service. I was unable to reach room service as the phone just kept ringing. Another 45 minutes later and numerous attempts to call, I went downstairs to the restaurant and saw no one there to help me order. I waited 10-15 minutes and saw not even one worker so I decided to go back to the front desk to see if I can find help. At the front desk I saw Crissy helping a line of people and she was the only one helping. This hotel must be short on staff because with a line like that, I would assume one would be highly overwhelmed. Apparently, after eavesdropping, I gathered their flight or plans were cancelled. I thought my day was bad until I heard some of these peoples horror stories of not having a decent meal since 7am! Watching people venting frustrations and upset people taking out on her, Crissy maintained a polite and positive attitude. Finally, her back up came and they managed to check everyone in within 10 minutes. When she finally noticed me standing there she asked me if I was ok and I explained my issue regarding room service. She and Patrice seemed apologetic and they took my order and walked it over to the kitchen. They said it should be half an hour and my food came in less than half an hour qt that point. Thank you Crissy and Patrice! The grounds seem like it has alot of potential, surrounded by water with amazing views, however, it seems dated and can use some renovation. The hotel has a Hawaiian theme however the buildings (according to the hotel map) are named after Mexican cities. Cabo, and cozumel, cancun? Doesn't make sense. The furniture in the lobby and in the rooms seem old fashioned and I don't understand why or how it fit the hotel motif if it even had one. The bed was an older bed and felt like it had to be 20 years old. The hotel definately needs some updating and renovation, once that is done I'm sure the hotel would be a great resort. Also, if the staff is more trained and anything like Crissy and Patrice, I would come back because they seemed very sweet and helpful. Until then, if i were in the area, I would probably go to another one of the 4 hotels in the area.

My co-workers and I were there for a radiology conference that was held at the resort and felt it was best to stay on premises as transportation was limited and daily parking was expensive. Looking back now, I would have stayed off-site. I went to a radiology meeting there, and arrived few days early and the hotel was disappointing to say the least. There were over 250 attendees at the meeting with a general consensus that the facility was less than adequate. Many people only tolerated an unacceptable situation, others changed rooms, others stayed out of their hotel rooms for as long as possible and yet others simply moved out of the Kona Kai. I reserved at this particular hotel from the radiology association website and now I realize that the links to the Kona Kai Resort website have been grossly photoshopped, doctored, embellished and glorified! The Kona Kai at Shelter Pointe in San Diego, CA is rated 3.9 and average for the area by Hotels.com. This is a FAULTY rating as it does not even come close to the description and photos in on Hotels.com. The lobby was spartan, the furniture in the lobby was worn and needed replacement or reupholstering. Upon entering the hallway to my room, it was obvious I were staying in a sub-standard motel that had no pretense of being a three star hotel much less a resort. There were stains on the carpet, food trays left in the hallways, dust hanging from the ventilation grates, scuffs along the walls of the hallway and doors to the rooms. I was in a room and it was not worth anything close to what they charged. The Hotels.com and AAA rate listed for the room is around $89 and yet they charged $189 in November - off season. My room was not only dated, the last time it had been renovated was probably years ago, but it had a strong musty and mildew odor. The air conditioner was antiquated and turning it on only added to the moldy and mildew odor. The room is dark and poorly lit, only a light by the door and two lamps beside the bed. Opening the cheap aluminum sliding doors leading to the courtyard-pool area to get rid of the foul musty smell, only reconfirmed what I was seeing. The flimsy screen door latch looked as though it could be easily opened from the outside even when locked. Also the curtains covering the door to the patio were also stained and torn. The wall papered walls in the room had stains running up it and was dusty. I don't think anyone has cleaned it in quite some time. The carpeting in the room had numerous stains on it and worst of all, the bed sheets were stained. The furniture in the room was old and worn, small TV, few cable stations. The bath linens were no better, having yellow and dark stains on towels. The bathroom looked as though it had received only a cursory cleaning with soap scum evident on the shower stall tiles and hairs on the shower floor. The bathroom had no vanity area or counter space at all even though this was a handicapped room. The coffee pot was placed on a cheap water damaged wooden stand next to the bathroom sink so that it could be plugged into the razor outlet. All the other electrical outlets in the room were removed except for one in the small corner between the air conditioning unit and closet/ TV armoire. This single electrical outlet is not even accessible for the handicapped person. It looks like that at one point were electrical outlets in the room but all the convenience electrical plugs for the computer by both the desk and night stands have been removed. There is a table on the patio with two chairs but it has not been cleaned for a while. There were cigarette butts all over the rocks providing ground cover for the shrubs. My room was no different in lack of maintenance than that of my colleagues attending the meeting. Many rooms had foul odors which were permeating clothing and you could smell in the person's clothes at the meeting. The drains in the showers, bathtubs and sinks did not drain properly resulting in standing in water during a shower. In my room the shower drain was backing up when showering. This problem must have persisted for some time as the cheap particle board stand for the coffee machine in the bathroom had been soaked in water enough to cause swelling of the wood and loss of paint on the surface. The walls are so thin, you can expect to be awakened when the staff push their service carts down the hallway each morning at 6 a.m. Also, the housekeeping staff was very loud in the morning -- they would be outside in the corridors calling down the halls to one another. I could hear the conversations in the hallway with the room door closed. You can also hear creaking of floor above every morning from the people walking around. The worst part was the outside door slamming very loudly each time someone left or came into the building. Very poor room service. Rooms were not cleaned promptly. Often they were still cleaning at 2 p.m. There were a lot of room service trays left outside doors all the time and the food trays would be left there for several days. Overpriced on-premise restaurant. Cockroaches were seen in the dining area by more than colleague so I decided I would eat out even though it is quite a walk. The Kona Kai does offer a shuttle service to local restaurants but it is a Kia minivan that can only accommodate 6 passengers. The wait for a shuttle out to a nearby restaurant was 2 hours. Shuttles to the airport in the same minivan. Makes for long waits when you are at meeting with over 250 people. I discovered several restaurants which were much better than that offered by the Kona Kai- i.e.; Blue Wave in the Best Western Hotel next door, Fiddlers Green (steaks), Brigantine (good seafood), Point Loma Seafood and Juice It Up (smoothies and panini). Most of the restaraunts are a fair walk away (about 1 mile) so bring comfortable walking shoes except the Blue Wave which is about 5 minute walk. Expect to be nickeled and dimed to death... Charge for the fitness center!!!! $10.00/day Charge for computer and printer use!!! $.35 per minute on old antiquated computers Charge for the parking!!!! $10 or $15/day Charge for extra chair in room!!! All in all VERY disappointing. It was a disastrous eight nights in the hotel and although I tried to talk with reception staff, there was great difference. I felt a little hospitality. I was referred to the hotel manager who conveniently was never available when I was at the reception desk. There are three other hotels next door that are much better. Best Western next door at only $95 per night, and the Bay Club. Keep on looking, pass on the Kona Kai. The rooms are run down and the staff were less than enthusiastic about helping. Save your money and heed this advice and the other negative reviews, as they are the TRUTH not the pictures you see on the Kona Kai website or Hotels.com. The positive reviews must be from relatives of employees or paid evaluators.

We had made plans to watch the Hawaiian Luau show that Kona Kai runs on Fridays in the summer and then stay the balance of the weekend. First off, checking in and parking were a breeze and very efficient. When I entered the lobby to check in, the first thing I noticed was the warm Spanish Villa styled lobby area. The huge fireplace, cushy chairs and couches, and warm tones immediately put me in a good mood. We were greeted by the manager Dennis Vinegas who assured us that our stay would be memorable (and he was right). Our bellman, then helped us to our room and took care of our baggage...he was so fast that he actually beat us to our room (I still don;t know how he did it!). When we got to our room, we noticed that we had a great view of the main courtyard and pool, as well as the marina (and a nice balcony to take it all in)...what a specatacular view. After settling in , we saw the Luau/Hula show which was fantastic...the food was delcious, in particular the Kahlua Pork and the Lomi Lomi Salmon..I have to admit I went back for seconds and thirds! The show was very nice, with children and adult perfomers and even two fire dancers...The next day,(Saturday) we awoke and had breakfast in the main dining room. Again, it was a very comforting place, with it's vaulted turret ceiling and beautiful views of the Shelter Island Marina...and the food was plentiful and freshly prepared..and most importantly, served efficiently and courteously. The wait and bus staff was qucik to cater to our every need. Later, we went to hang out at the pool and jacuzzi and spent the bulk of the day just lounging and relaxing. The hotel has a pool cocktail/food server and we definitely took advantage of their services. The Calamari and the Mojitos are a must-try.by the pool. We had dinner offsite that night (another story which is not so nice...I won't mention the place). But we made it back in time for a nice evening soak in the jacuzzi and for our daughter to play on the playground adjacent to the pool before heading to bed. Thewre were other families in that area with a fire going in the firepit on site which gave the evening a real \"clambake\" celebratory feel...a very nice night. On Sunday, we again had breakfast in the dining room (we ate breakfast there every morning)...then did some sight-seening down by Seaport Village (a short drive away)...it was warm outside though, and we found ourselves back at the pool again by early afternoon for more swimming, mojitos and calamari! The whole experience of this place was perfect for us...the hotel has so many areas where people can gather and play cards, visit with family etc.(there were many family reunions and a few weddings that weekend...but there was always plenty of space on the hotel grounds to do your own thing)....The decor and service at every level invited you to relax, and enjoy...and that is really what you want out of a mini-vacation...the bottomline on our trip is that we intend to return and make more family memories very soon.

Now for the bad things the Hotel was built in 1962 and really needs to be re-furbished, it apparently was suppose to happen last year but due to finances not being available it didn't happen. The rooms are shabby and tired with dated bathrooms the rooms are not cleaned that well but that is also to do with it being all so old, I did have a hairslide and some cereal by my bed when we checked in, the room viewed our car on the carpark, road, and then harbour view as this was the last 4 days of our honeymoon we wanted this to be so special, before unpacking we complained and were given a marine view room, it was shabby but had a feeling that all the rooms were the same.

It was huge with a lounge kitchenette, 2 bathrooms, large bedroom but again decor very tired, out dated bathroom, but it was a light room, so success. another moan $10 dollars to use the gym!!!! that means another $80 dollars on our bill if we used it daily. another moan Free breakfast, yes but you have very little choice if you dont want un-healthy waffles, pancakes etc. $2.75 for toast $2.95 glass of orange juice, just madness!! why not do a buffett style it's so disorganised. Location - great if you want peace and quiet, but you do need a car, it costs $24 to get a taxi to gaslamp district which can make it an expensive night out. The concierge guy is really helpful, and does run a bus to the airport, if it's convenient he will drop you at the airport where you can catch a bus in, it's a lot cheaper, but not the nicest of experiences and you would still need to get a taxi return. If you really want to be staying on shelter Island check out the Best Western, Humphries,or Blue Wave they are all just a bit further along the island, but if your a party nightlife person, it's not the right location.

We loved it. The weather was a little more cooperative last time, but that's not the problem.

I bet when the signs went up the hotel smacked their chops and went 'cha ching'. Also, the dog fee. Gone Waaaaaay up. We don't mind paying a fee for the privilege but its outrageous now. I felt like we maybe could have booked her her own room... If you want to workout? You have to pay extra for that too. The room was not so great. They put us in a Handicapped room for some bizarre reason. Neither of us are. This meant the bathroom was large, but had NO COUNTER. The cleanliness of the room bothered me. The wall papered feature wall in the bathroom (alongside the toilet/basin...the one with no counter) reflected in the light a host of stains running up it. I don't think anyone has run a cloth over it in quite some time...yeeeck. Also the curtains covering the door to the balcony...aside from looking rather sad and old, were also stained with...something...not too sure what...blood? wine? ketchup? double yeeeck!

We had arrived early along with several other members of our group, it was just past noon and check-in is at 4:00 PM. We were told our rooms would be ready in an hour so we walked back down the island to find lunch. Returning at 2:00 Rooms were ready, except for mine which seemed to take an extra hour and was still missing some of the normal niceties like coffee and toilet paper. On the positive side the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. They also seemed to have the ability to reduce or in some cases eliminate the advertised $15.00 parking fee for those who had rental cars. There are four resorts on Shelter Island. The Kona Kai is the last one in the line maintaining what I would see as the prime location. During the weekend we walked along the island many times and saw the maintenance and landscaping work being performed at the other resorts, especially the Bay Club. I hope the Kona Kai begins their projects soon. The resort is beautiful, but it has the potential to be so much better. Neglect is a harsh word though ignored is descriptive of their grounds, the decorative vegetation appeared to be attempting self-sufficiency. We had rooms on the ground floor, our patios opened onto the grassy area by the pool. The building was bordered by Bird of Paradise bushes, always a fascination to those from the northeast, these however needed some attention. Fortunately the bed area had small stepping stones as a walkway by each door that allowed you to walk through the mud and water caused by excessive irrigation. My daughter\u2019s room was at the low end of the line and the irrigation combined with the drain from the ice machine formed a moat in front, a constant source of enjoyment for my three year old grandson and his mother\u2019s dismay. In general the landscaping needs work. It has promise but has not had attention in a long time. The interiors of the hotel were clean and in good repair but seemed to be in need of something. I do not know the age of the Kona Kai but it gives the impression of an old resort that needs some TLC. Overall our stay was pleasant. Maid service was sufficient, although not efficient. Perhaps in keeping with the tropical theme the staff worked on \u201cisland time\u201d. Our group for the wedding numbered about 80, all from out of the area, and the majority stayed at the Kona Kai. Most of us found that the dining options at the Kona Kai restaurant were a bit expensive for our tastes. I only ate one meal in the restaurant, breakfast on the last morning and while the meal was very good the cost exceeded what I would normally budget. Fortunately there are other options off premises, some within a pleasant walk. The only truly negative aspect of our stay occurred on Sunday evening. We had closed down the wedding reception and had gathered in a few groups, in rooms and by the pool, as we had done on the two previous evenings without issue. Obviously a new night security guard was in place this evening and recognizing the possibility of a noisy gathering he took interest. I fully understand his job and the responsibilities he has to the facility and its guests, however he needs training in the art of tact and diplomacy. His confrontational, disrespectful and threatening initial approach caused to escalate a non-existing situation. Fortunately a compromise was reached; we were given an area to continue our conversations and celebrations and even assisted with some of the amenities, the evening continued without incident. When I return to the San Diego area I probably will not choose to stay at the Kona Kai.

It is away from the hustle and bustle of downtown and next to the marina and bay. Yahooo!!! 4 days and 3 nights next to the water! Even with a parking fee of $15/day, it seemed like a deal. Check-in was a little tricky since my request for either a 1st floor room or an elevator up to other floors was overlooked. Room 140 appeared to be perfect - parking close to the room, a lanai looking at the Marina and close to the main building and restaurant. Upon entering the room, we noticed a musty smell. It's fairly common for waterfront hotel rooms, so we chalked it up to the hotel's location. As time went on, we noticed another scent. There was a urine smell coming from the carpet next to the desk and door to the lanai. It was so unexpected, that I couldn't believe it! I actually got on my hands and knees to sniff the carpet to make sure of what I was smelling and where it was coming from. Yuck! Looks like someone snuck a pet into the room. Housekeeping can't notice it cuz they open both the lanai door and room door for ventilation when they clean. The lanai door is glass and covered with a fabric curtain tacked down with rods at top and bottom to the door. It isn't easily removed - I tried. The glass-side of the curtain is white (sorta) and covered with mildew. Maybe that's where the musty smell comes from. Daily housekeeping surely can't address it since they can't even access the glass from the inside of the room. Daily housekeeping was done well and with diligence. The housekeeping staff is professional and friendly. The grounds are well-maintained and the healthy plants, trees, and shrubs add to the resort's appearance. The breakfast that is included with the breakfast plan is more than adequate. There are 5 or 6 breakfast options (no substitutions). Additions are very pricey, so avoid them. Wait staff is helpful, though not overly-attentive. Check-out was easy and pleasant. Trudi assisted in every way possible. When she asked if we enjoyed our stay, I mentioned the smells in the room and the mildew on the door. She apologized profusely, made notes on the computer and asked if I would fill out a customer card. She quickly offered to \"comp\" our parking fees for the stay!

Arrived late in the evening, and was given a room facing a wall. Had reserved a room with an water view, and upon opening the door, the stench of animal urine hit me in the face. (evidently, they allow pets). Asked to be moved to a room that didn't smell and faced the water. Was given a room facing the road and bay upstairs over the lobby. (no elevator - had to carry bags up two flights of stairs) Room was the quality of a truck stop. Old furniture, small tv, few cable stations. Bathroom had light so dim, you couldn't see yourself in the mirror. If you were over five feet two inches, you had to bend down to get under the shower nozzle. Opening the closet door, we were once again hit with animal urine smell that since it had been closed up, it was so strong that it made me start coughing. Asked for another room. Got another one in the very same condition. Gave up since we had been traveling for twelve hours to get to the west coast and we were exhausted, so I asked them for room deodorizer spray. The faucets on the sink twirled in 360 degrees, so you had to keep turning them to get them to come on and shut off. Took a shower in the morning, and water wouldn't heat above luke warm. Walked out of the room and noticed the dirty dishes left on trays in front of two rooms next to us were still there from the night before. Headed off to go sight seeing and returned that evening, the dishes were still there and the hallway was very smelly from food left on the floor. Asked the front desk to have them removed. After two more calls over two more days, I finally called hotel manager and he seemed perturbed at the request. Said he would get them picked up immediately. Came back to my room in four hours, and one tray had been picked up and two others still remained. The hallway stunk, the room stunk... we stayed out as much as possible. The bed coverings also had animal urine smell.... I know that smell because I've had dogs all my life, and I know it well. Came home and washed everything I hung in closets because my clothes retained the putrid odor. Concierge desk is a joke. They knew nothing about restaurants or activities in the area.

First, I had a wedding to attend to in Mission Bay, so the location was perfect because it wasn't too far. The hotel was located in a quiet area along the bay in the Shelter Island Area. It was quiet, beautiful, and relaxing all in one. Dennis Vinegas, an employee there, set the reservation for the room for me. He set me up with the perfect room with an awesome view (Many thanks to Dennis!). The room was itself was cozy and comfortable, but it was the balcony that really did it for me. It was so relaxing just to sit on the balcony area and look out on the bay. Sleeping, we just left the balcony door open and let the bay breeze blow in to cool us down. Living in Vegas now, staying at the Kona Kai made me remember some of the things I truly miss the most about San Diego. The pool at the Kona Kai was a delight too. It was just as quiet and relaxing as our room. A pet peeve of mine is to be trying to relax at a pool while a bunch of young children splash you with water and scream the whole time. This was most definitely NOT the case here. Dining at the Kona Kai restaurant went just as well. My boyfriend and I couldn't resist and ordered 4 breakfast plates between the 2 of us. We opted to sit outside on the patio where the host told lead us to the table with what she dubbed as \"the perfect view\"....and she was right. We enjoyed our breakfast with a perfect view of both the bay and the hotel at a table with just the right amount of sunshine and a gentle breeze. If you're looking for a real hidden gem by the San Diego Bay, I completely recommend the Kona kai Resort.

I'd read all the reviews beforehand so wasn't sure what to expect. I'd been hoping to get Best Western Island Palm or Humphries Half Moon. We arrived Fri April 10th. Check in was fairly fast with Jason at the front desk. The first room we got was a ground floor handicap access room just down the hair from front desk. On going in, the room wasn't bad as everything seemed clean and well laid out. We discovered however that the handle of the hot water faucet on the wash room sink was broken and fell right off when we tried to turn on the water to wash our hands. Then when I picked up the phone to call front desk to let them know, I discovered the phone wasn't working and had no dial tone. I went back out to Jason and front desk and he changed our room right away. We moved to room 125. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite as nice looking as the first room but as everything was working, we decided to stay in it. The lighting in this room was very very dim whereas the first room was very well lit. The bathroom was also outdated and had an old tub whereas the first room had a very newly renovated bathroom. Oh well, I guess it was a tradeoff but as long as everything was working, we were staying put. Based on the reviews I read beforehand, I bought ear plugs with me. It was a good thing I did as the first and second night was noisy. There were kids upstairs running around past 11:00 pm. I wouldn't have been able to sleep without the ear plugs. Once Sunday night hit, everything quieted down and it was peacefully quiet. Nice things about hotel: 1) It was central to everything we wanted to see. About 15 minutes to Cabrillo National Monument and 15 mins downtown. We rented a car from Alamo for $10/day so had no problem getting around. 2) Shelter Island is beautiful, peaceful and safe. It was beautiful to wake up, look out the window and see the water. 3) Housekeeping staff was very friendly. Greeted us each morning and cleaned our room well. 4) Front desk staff was very friendly and greeted us all the time. 5) Room had a fridge which was handy. 6) Free wifi internet access Bad Things: 1) Parking is expensive and you don't really have a choice but to pay for their parking there ($15/night) 2) Our room lighting was poor and washroom needed upgrades 3) Really bad pillows here so if that's important, bring your own. 4) Hotel doesn't provide towels at the pool area. You have to bring your own or the room towel. All in all, for the money I paid, I felt I got a fair deal.

We found Shelter Island and the Kona Kai easily using the Garmin. Upon our arrival we were told there would be an additional $15 per night for parking! To me this is absolutely outrageous! This charge should either be included into the room price, or absorbed by the hotel. This is a hotel without parking! Also, after dinner my wife wanted some water and ice. I covered the entire second floor of our building looking for an ice machine. Then I went downstairs to the lobby and asked about the location. I was told if I go down to room 115 and look for an exit that would be the ice machine. I gave them my special look and the receptonist took my ice bucket and went to the kitchen and got some ice for me. I thought that was nice, but I still didn't have the water. I went back looking for the ice machine. There was NO SIGN indicating that there may be ice and soda machines anywhere. Very poor service indeed! After a while I found the machines. They were hidden outside by the pool. I was on the second floor and there were no services available on our floor and NO signs directing you to the services either. The rooms were clean. The furniture in our room was well worn. I will say this for the Kona Kai and it's location: it was a very quiet place. The view of the city from our room was blocked by trees. So we got to look across the water at what appeared to be a military installation. Not too pretty. We did enjoy watching the fishermen retrieving pots and speculating on what they were catching. We also enjoyed the sounds of the seals barking... All in all, we had a good time despite the difficulties given us by the Kona Kai. In case you're wondering I think that the extra $15 for parking is more than enough reason NOT to stay here. We were told that parking may be extra, but who would expect it to cost as much as a 1/2 tank of gas for one night?! Poor way to treat \"guests\" if you ask me! (after spending $200+ for a night in a mediocre room.) Luckily we were smart enough not to eat there! Ruth's Chris Steak House is not far away and is good.

From the website Kona Kai Resort and Spa seamed like the place to be at the time. My first impression was that it was really nice on the outside when i walked in i was a bit disapointing because the rooms were so small and a bit out dated. The sink was very small barely had any room for anything. The building is older so their was a lot of creaks and squiks at night which freaked me out. I am a fair person It was a clean hotel though when we got back to our room everyday the room had been cleaned. We had a King size bed and it was very confy and spacious. :) We made reservation for Valentines at the resteraunt at Kona Kai and it was very small and over priced the food was disgusting me and my husband even joked and said that we should of went to Jack in the box and we would of been more satisfied. I love fish but the salmon tasted as if it was days old and the salad was a cheap lettuce head and one small tomatoe and a two baby carrots. The only fairly descent food was the desert. we ended up paying over $150 for 4 pieces of lettuce one small tomatoe, two baby carrots and a little plastic cup with dressing, a under cooked a few days old salmon with a cup of over boiled rice, and a small little dessert which was the only half way descent food of the meal. I was furious because we could not eat the food it was so disgusting. We only ate desert. Later when i checked out they had charged me and extra $92.00 for some other persons room service and made me seam as though i was crazy who was trying to get a cheap discount. When the receptionist finally decided to do her job and investigate she realized that i was rite i never ordered that food it was another room. and told me that it had been put back on my card. Well I dropped my husband off at the airport and went home with a broken heart to come to realize that not only had she not given back my $92.00 she had charged it on my account plus kept the original balance. so she had charged me for some other persons meal twice. well i called and spoke to accounting which was a self centered unproffessional who called me a liar and said that the receptionist had not charged me. Well I told her that I had been charged for the meal seperate from my hotel bill because why would my bank show a individual charge of $92.00 all our room service was added to the total amount due. she was rude and not helpful she almost made me cry because she was set to not help me. I asked to speak to her manager and she pretty much told me their was not one else above her I was furious at this point because she was refusing me my right to speak to a manager. Finally she transfered me to the hotel manager that all of a sudden mysteriously she happened to have a manager. I got his voice mail and left a detailed message with all my phone numbers. In a process of about three days i left two to three messages a day and never not once recieved a phone call back. On the fourth day I looked at my account online and saw exactly was i suspected I was charged the original amount which included the extra $92.00 and an individual $92.00 charge. than I was refunded twice $92.00. so not only was i correct but i am still trying to get in contact with someone their to explain how badley i was treated and i have yet to recieve a phone call back. They are rood, inconciderate, mean, and a big rip off. One advice i would give the staff of Kona Kai would be smiling with your voice goes a long way, and not accusing the guest a paying guest at that we lert over $1000 their, of being a liar. Admitt to your mistake and the least I would expect would be an apology. Never again this was a horrible expeirience. Oh yah And the heater kept breaking and everytime we would call the front desk they would get mad at us as though it was our fault that their electric system was old and kept making the heater blow out.

The air conditioner was a bit noisy, but maintained the room's temperature nicely. The restaurant was very nice with sweeping views of the harbor and hills through floor to ceiling windows. The staff was courteous and efficient, and the food was of good quality, although pricey. The pool area was exceptional for its views, comfort and cleanliness. The pool was quite large for a hotel, and the hot tub was very nice. The conference I attended was held in three meeting rooms, which were kept quite cold. I needed a jacket to stop my shivering. The rooms were well equipped and spacious. Overall, I was satisfied with this hotel and its very nice location. I will stay here again.

I would not pay the going rates to stay here. However, the hotel has amazing views from everywhere on the property. The grounds are nice and it's actually quite a small hotel. Shelter Island has a neat waterfront walkway with people jogging and walking dogs. It's truly what San Diego is all about....being outside and enjoying the water and sunshine. The hotel is fine. I would say it is on par with any generic Doubletree hotel. The staff are generally nice and helpful. I had to wait until after 4pm to get my room even though others I was with got into their rooms at 9:30am. The next day my room wasn't serviced until after 4:30pm. But they were completely full and our conference was there after all. About the room...I was given a ground floor room in the first building next to the main building. Every ground floor room has a patio and all other rooms have balconies, which is really nice. But my room was a wheelchair accessible king room, so the bathroom was extra large and the sink and toiletries were out of the toilet and shower/bathtub room. The toiletries are ok; the brand is Gilchrist and Soames. The bedding is terrible and has a bedspread that is the old type that probably isn't ever washed. The tv was old and the air conditioning is located under the window and is controlled from the unit itself. One night it was cold in the room and the other night it was really warm and the settings were the same both nights. The patio furniture was dirty and I didn't want to sit on it. My room faced the bay but the building is lower than the parking lot in front of it, so it's difficult to see much. If you want to see the bay, ask for a room above ground floor. The other thing that was not good about the room was that I killed about 4 spiders, and some of them weren't small. I lived in San Diego for 4 years, so I know about the bugs there, but for a hotel that charges a lot of money, they should do something about that. I did not use the exercise facility this time but I did last year. It's nice and they have a lot of cardio machines. There is a \"spa\" there with a few treatment rooms. It seems like there are locals that use the gym there, so maybe they have memberships. On the plus side, the conference food is good. I didn't try the restaurant food. They do have free wifi about everywhere in the hotel and around the grounds, which is nice. If you want an average hotel in a great location this is the hotel for you. It seems to be family-friendly too.

Great pool with a lap lane (I am a swimmer). Great views on both sides (harbor and bay)- you cant lose on view with a room on either side. Very peaceful and restful during the day. Very nice room and balcony. Free internet that I could get, even on the beach (bay side). Nice jacuzzi. Good food at restaurant. We did not notice any carpet problems or mildew smell as a previous reviewer. Free shuttle was nice and they will drop you off and pick you up anywhere between the hotel and the airport. We did not rent a car. We enjoyed renting bikes and riding them down to the gaslamp area. Wonderful! They only charge $5 for 2 hours and even gave us a little extra time :) Great place to jog along the bay or on one day I ran north up to the top of tjhe hill and the Pt Loma bible college. Plenty of free parking ont he street. Lille kids playground on their beach. Cons- Noisy at times at night. The walls do seem a bit thin but mostly when my neighbors ran water, it was very loud in my room and would wake me up. It was a Pro for me but could be a Con for you that the hotel is at the end of the isalnd and sort of removed from everything. Easily solved by renting a bike or car, though. One day the maid forgot to make up our room. :( The staff was fine but not overly friendly. Shuttle driver gave us good advice on places to eat. I really liked the touch of Venice restaurant down the way. Water taxi only ran between 3-9. Better to ride bike to the real water taxi by the russian sub- it goes all day and is super cheap.

Kona Kai is sort of lame and uptight. Can't describe it really. The \"view\" from the rooms is obstructed partially. Just an okay experience. Would rate it a C+.

The carpeting in the room had numerous stains on it and worst of all, the bed comforters were soiled, one with a large blood stain. The sheets were no better, having yellow stains on both beds. The bathroom was very small and looked as though it had received only a cursory cleaning subsequent to the previous guest and prior to our arrival. Plumbing fixtures were either rusty or calcified.

The stairs leading to their room looked to be made of flimsy plywood that had been painted to conceal the deterioration. Carpets and bedding in their room were soiled as well.

The room was great, the staff was friendly and very helpful, and my wife and I both feel this is the most exquisuite location we've ever stayed at. The view of the marina from our room was just spectacular, and the pool and jacuzzi were wonderful.

First off they had us arriving in March, we reserved for February. Because of their mistake we were put in a bay view room with queen beds, we reserved a harbor view room with a king. The gentleman at the front desk offered to lower our rate for the trouble, yet he lowered it to the regular rate of the room we ended up in. Room service meal was awful, over priced drinks at the bar (AJ's). They charged the wrong credit card and finally - this is the loudest hotel I have ever stayed in in my life (I have traveled internationally for years). The walls are PAPER THIN and you can hear everything. We could hear people's full conversations in other rooms, heard hairdryers at 6 in the morning, could hear if some blew there nose for crying out loud. Save your money and take heed to this and the other negative reviews, as they are the TRUTH.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Kona Kai Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d82443-Reviews-Kona_Kai_Resort-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$131 - $237*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1551 Shelter Island Dr</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92106</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515565", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/85/08/2f/kona-kai-resort.jpg"}}
