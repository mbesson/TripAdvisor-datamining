{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Overpriced This is a typical Travelodge - I've stayed in a couple in the UK and they have the same kind of features. The common areas are acceptable - nice looking entrance and reception, breakfast area clean and tidy. Once you go off to your room, though, you see the truth - flimsy construction, claustrophic and grubby corridors and cheap furnishings. Good points: the bedclothes were clean, so were the carpets and bathroom floor in my room. Provision of cutlery and crockery, tea and coffee were good, with a little carton of fresh milk in the fridge. Bad points: there was a damp smell in the room and the bathroom walls and ceiling were mildew-spotted. Bedclothes were scanty: one thin sheet and blanket each, although there were spare pillows. Tiny cake of soap and one little container of shampoo and conditioner between two: two bathtowels were provided but only one handtowel. Breakfast was expensive at $16 a head, although the food was acceptable and plentiful. The self-serve toaster had been broken since the previous day, according to staff, so no toast.Staff were friendly and approachable. All in all not too bad, but very expensive at just under $140 a night in low season (and I did shop around to get the best deal).", "Date": "Jun 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR194344143", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "coffscricketnut"}, {"Content": "Lots of tourists A reasonably priced hotel in an expensive city, and one of few in the booming west. I spent a week here in November 2006. Comfortable room, welcome air conditioning, helpful staff. A favourite with bus tours of Chinese tourists. Minimal facilities, but access to adjacent working mens club and sports facilities", "Date": "Dec 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR477998032", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Sparky81"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d278580-r16915841-Travelodge_Hotel_Blacktown-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "278580", "Price": "$129"}}
