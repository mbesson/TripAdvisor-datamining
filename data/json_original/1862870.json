It's extremely well located, just a couple of minutes walk from main Berlin S-Bahn route (it's the Noldnerplatz station); there are three pubs and a bakery/coffee place in the same street (in case you, as we did, decide to skip breakfast), closest \"Spatkauf\" is some 10 minutes away. The Room was very clean and spacious, equipped with a tv, a minifridge (came pretty handy as it was way too freezing outside :) and plenty of storage space. Toilet/shower facility was very neat too, small but clean and efficient and they even provided towels and toiletries. Free wi-fi had an excellent connection and the staff I spoke with seemed really pleasant. Overally I'd 100% recommend this hotel to student/low budget travellers, cause it's not fancy in any way but the price was EXTREMELY nice and there is nothing that would make you not like the hotel either.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northamptonshire", "Title": "\u201cGood value, good room, good links, lots of stairs\u201d", "Author": "weekender79", "ReviewID": "UR119152042", "Content": "Simple room with ensuite, towels were changed, heating was warm, shower was fine, beds ok.
