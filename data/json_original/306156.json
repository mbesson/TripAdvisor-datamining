The bathroom was very clean and there was complimentary shower gel, shampoo and toilet soap. Excellent water pressure in the shower. Clean bathtub. Bathroom was a bit small. Check in and out handled very professionally. Staff in the Sunrise restaurant were very polite except to guests who arrived at the closing time of the buffets, when they would almost rudely tell guests to hurry up or refuse to let them have the buffet. but overall the staff were courteous and helpful.

There is still some of the indestructible rosewood furniture in the lobby. The room was not too small and the decor is modern, no nice old rosewood furniture left here. It has everything that you expect in a decent Singapore hotel: toiletries, robes, flat screen television, mini bar, coffee making.

The staff are great, I even get welcomed with a kiss and a hug from all the Concierges who are great people. The rooms are standard rooms that we book although you can book premier rooms for 25 UKP a night more, this room comes with breakfast usually. The standard rooms are rosewood and are a comfortable size and have all the usual things in the room. The hotel has a pool and one thing which I think hotels should have is a self service laundry ($6.00 plus $6.00 SP). The Grand Pacific has this and that is super handy to have. The only drawback we have since we have been visiting the Grand Pacific Hotel, the rooms have gone up from 53 UKP to 110 UKP per night since 2009. This price would include breakfast for two people. I would like to ask the question why? I expect price rises but not that much. They are pricing themselves out of existance where many people cannot afford to pay these prices, expecially people like ourselves who go for a week or so at a time. They don't do a long stay rate which is extremely unusual nor Corporate rates. We have been told for the last three years that the rooms are being upgraded, the standard room that we were in hadn't been. We used to get high floors but now they won't put us any higher than floor 9. However, the premier rooms are the higher rooms. We have also noticed that the hotel is never full, only 50% full, so why don't they lower their prices and include breakfast and it would be brilliant. I would like to tell you about the breakfast which we have had in the past alot. The staff remember you if you come back, you have all the usual buffet food including a counter where you can ask for eggs and bacon, omelettes all freshly cooked. The lady that works on that section is great, doesn't speak alot of english but you ask for what you want and she does it for you perfectly. Hassan (very nice gentleman with a suit on, you cannot miss him) is extremely obliging and will help in any way he can. He originally said \"come and stay at this hotel, you will not be disappointed\". We haven't been. One tip, ask for a room facing Victoria Street, if you face the back where the pool is there is alot of noise in the room and it is bad. Book your hotel on an asian based website, don't assume you have to book if with your tour operator. I have been booking holidays for ourselves (2 people) and our friends (4 extra people) for ten or so years and have never had a problem that we could not fix. They also have a fantastically easy transport system near the Grand Pacific, you can go on three lines on the MRT, work out where you are going on a map then go to the one that works for you. The buses are great, we have been out in the middle of nowhere not knowing where we will end up and have seen buses that say on the side of them Victoria Street and we have hopped on. Easy. The other thing I would say is get an EZY card with stored value which we keep using everytime we go. The value stays on it and lasts for as long as you need it within reason. Don't be the person that has to buy the ticket, if you do don't forget you get a dollar back after you have completed your journey. It is obviously daft if you are only there for one or two days, but it is still nice to take home for a souvenir. We have had ours for years and have had a changeover card due to the original one being upgraded. When you go for your stay always go in a taxi from the airport, everywhere in the world is expensive, not there! We have never paid more that $20.00 (10 UKP) each way, but we have always arrived in the daytime. The price can double between midnight and 6am. Do not book the shuttle you want to get there quicker unless it comes as a freebee. An American company has recently taken over the Grand Pacific Hotel and thinks oh we will put the prices up by 100%, nobody will mind, tourists will pay it. It is sad and I really would like to get a reply from Head office on this matter. I would also want some sort of loyalty scheme for regular customers that they get points etc like the Hilton, or an automatic upgrade as many hotels do in Asia and Australia. We have already stayed one week on this holiday and are going back in 10 days for 8 nights and will ask for a different room again. I have a list of which are ok and which are not. We are looking forward to it. About Singapore review: Why do people only come to Singapore for a stopover? I have talked to many people and they say \"yes, I've been to Singapore\", and I say \"great, where did you see?\" The usual places are Raffles, Sentosa Island, Bird Zoo, Night Zoo etc. What are these people doing, they are missing the great places as well that are undiscovered. We have been on many really good walks and seen loads of wildlife that are wandering about. Last week we went to Kranji and got on a bus $3.00 SP each and went to the Wetlands Centre, we saw snakes, monitor lizards (big Ones), birds and all sorts of other creatures. It was brilliant and in the middle of nowhere. We also walked up to the Henderson Waves bridge and carried on for miles over the Southern Ridges on a tree top walk. At the end we caught a bus to the MRT and got that back to the hotel. You can go skiing at the ski place, go to museums, go for exciting things like Universal worlds and Sentosa Island. My tip go on the luge and go as fast as you can and buy a five go ticket for $25.00 SP, it is extremely good fun. Go on long walks, there is something for everyone including nature lovers. So we love Singapore and have been lots of times and are still finding loads of things to do, we are usually the only english people doing them but hey what does it matter! It is extremely safe, I have never been to a place where I felt like that all over the island. So my tip is take longer, stay longer plan what you want to do before you arrive. Talk to the Tourist Board, they have helped me time and time again.

This was a business trip and I stayed at the Grand Pacific (formerly the Allson) for 11 days. The hotel met all of my expectations. The check in was without problems even though I arrived at 1 in the morning. The room was ready and nicely set up. They are not overly spacious, but there was room for a (very comfortable) queen sized bed, a refrigerator with tea/coffee service on it, a desk with internet capabiities, and an easy chair with ottoman. The bathroom was not overly large but perfectly functional. The room was efficiently cleaned each day and the staff were pleasant. Sheets were changed every other day, or every day if requested. Some commented in other reviews about a musty smell in the rooms. That was definitely there if you didn't turn the air conditioning on. The a/c was highly effective. People must understand that Singapore is a VERY humid country -- the humidity each day approached 100 per cent and it wasn't raining. So I am sure that most everything has a bit of \"wet\" or \"musty\" smell. It's just a hot and wet country and you have to get used to it! The breakfast buffet was pleasant -- and yes, often the offerings were the same. But most of us eat the same thing for breakfast anyway. There was always cereals with milk, an omelette/egg station, breads and pastries, lots of fresh fruit, salads, and on the warm side, there was usually a Singaporean noodle dish, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, sausages/bacon, and potatoes of some sort. There was a sign on the buffet noting that people who left food on their plates would be charged 3 dollars for every 100g -- at first I was offput by that. And then I thought about it and realized it was just a way of reminding people not to waste food -- and they're right. I didn't ever see anyone charged. And I remembered to take only what I could eat, and if I was still hungry, I went back for seconds. There is a lovely pool on the 5th floor and I used it when I was doing my laundry -- there's 2 or 3 washers and dryers near the pool and it was fun to go swimming while waiting for my laundry to be done. By having the launderette, I was able to bring half the clothes I needed. That's a great perk. I managed to fit all my stuff in one suitcase which I did not need to check. There's also a fitness center near the pool -- it has two or three treadmills and some bicycles. There are also some free weights. Nothing very fancy, but good enough for me. Overall, I thought it was a wonderful place -- close to everything and a solid 3 star service.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "India", "Title": "\u201cGood, clean hotel, awsome location, not so friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "AtriumExplorer", "ReviewID": "UR117266299", "Content": "We, a group of 5, 4 adults and 1 kid stayed in the hotel for 5 days.

Did not have such a very bad experience, however, there should be a lot a of improvement from staff with respect to hospitality. I have hardly seen Singaporeans smiling, so the same applies here too. Swimming pool was nice, mostly deserted, but closes at 9 pm. Hotel Breakfast is good, not breathtaking, anyways- but will give you enough calories for a day. Right opposite to the Hotel, there was a 24 hours open Hawker food, which helps you taste all local food. My suggestion is do not take any Fish if you are not Chinese and if you are Indian. Average meal cost is SD 5.00, which is indeed cheap - try different varieties of Chicken Rice, if you are non veg! Dont even think about going there if you are Veg- they use same spoons for non veg and veg. My family except myself, all were veg and had to go to little india, pretty much walkable within 15 minutes. Avg meal cost in Indian veg restaurants is around SD 8.00. Its good to try singapore hawker food, as it is clean and upto the standards. And if at all you have ever been into a Zoo, do not opt for Night Safari, as I felt it was definitely bad - u cannot even see animals properly though it has a huge built up and the lighting is so so bad, that you cannot really see anyone!

Shopping in Orchard Road is a 15 min walk away, the harbour a 10 min walk and the nearest station only a short stroll. As has been stated, the rooms are a little dated. We had expected that following the name change, the hotel might have up-graded its rooms. They hadn't (or at least the rooms on the floor we stayed in). Still, for just over 100\u20ac, we were not complaining! Everything in the room worked well, the beds were comfortable and all was very clean. The room standard reminded me of a Mercure Hotel: not top-luxury but excellent value. The hotel pool was the ideal place at the end of a hot day, not too busy and well maintained. We found the staff helpful and were delighted to be able to get into our bedroom when we arrived early at 7.30am. The only disappointment was the breakfast. Expensive and rather limited. No cereal or milk products were on offer and the croissants less than appealing. Still, Raffles City was just around the corner!

Clearly, either you pay for that or compromise on other aspects. The hotel is not luxurious, but considering that the prices are low to middle 4 star for Singapore, it\u2019s not bad. Everything works, the room is well lighted and has all the facilities , the bed is comfortable, the amenities are adequate, there is a small clean pool and a workout room. The staff do their best considering the price paid. I found it notable that in addition to the usual signs to conserve water by reusing towels and sheets, this hotel also provided two wastebaskets: one for regular and the other, with a big recycle sign on it, for recyclables. This is notable because while hotels save money when guests re-use towels and sheets, and thus have an incentive to \u201cbe green\u201d, in this case by recycling trash, they don\u2019t actually \u201cget\u201d anything.

A food station where you can order your choice of freshly cooked eggs + bacon is also in this area.) Next door on one side of the hotel is a 7-11 store and on the other, a food hawker centre (had dinner here one night, but it was pretty average - maybe we chose the wrong menue or stall??) Bugis Markets are a few blocks walk from the hotel. We changed a $100 Aussie dollars on arrival at the airport, but then checked out the currency exchanges in the Bugis Markets and changed more dollars at the best rates there (both had no commission).. Lots of cheap (and nasty??) goods (bags/shoes/clothes - in small sizes!) for sale at the Markets but handy for gifts (cheap watches are SGD$5 or 3 bracelets = $SGD10) for the neighbours' small children back home. If you like MotherCare (for children/grandchildren goods and clothing) I found at least one store. Lots of the stores were having 20 - 70% sales when we were in S/Pore at the end of February/beginning of March. You can eat cheaply in Singapore at the numerous shopping centres (Bugis Junction is near the hotel). Look for Food Republic outlets in many of the shopping centres - there are all types of reasonably priced food venues all in one area - Indian/Thai/Indonesian/Korean/Malay + dessert counters. The Singapore Flyer has great views of the city and surrounds and if you present your Singapore Airlines boarding passes, you will get 20% off (SGD$47.20 for 2 people). We went on a Fun Vee City Tour hop on/hop off bus (SGD$19.90 x2 - this was a 'special' for 48 hours!!) + 1/2 hour river cruise (SGD$5 x2). There was a poor (if any) commentary on most of the buses we joined but for 2 days, we travelled all over the city, getting off and on at will. Be prepared to wait 15-30 mins for the buses! On leaving Singapore, it took 20 mins from the hotel to the airport (SGD$13.40 - we gave him $SGD20 as he was a guided tour on the way (better than Fun Vee Tour commentary)!! Harrods/Prada/Levis/perfumeries et etc etc are among the stores at the International Airport. ***WARNING: Don't get 'ripped off' at Newton's Food (Newtons MRT) -where ther are lots of food outlets, all touting for your business - it cost us $SGD105 for dinner for 2, on the last night and this was for 4 cooked prawns (SGD$8/100grams), a plate of calamari and rice + 2 soft drinks!!! Get a price BEFORE they cook and serve your meal - then at the end, they present you with the bill!!! We had no money left and had to cash more AUD$ after this costly experience!! WE WILL NEVER RETURN HERE AND WILL ADVISE ALL AND SUNDRY OF THE COST!! It was daylight (okay, so it was night time!) robbery....! Singapore can be cheap to eat, if you watch where the locals choose. We found Singapore to be clean and friendly and safe - just \"stung\" with the nasty surprise at Newton's!! As Singapore is hot and humid, watch your prices on bottled water - we paid anything from $SGD1 to SGD$3 per bottle and try to get a hotel with a pool (even a small pool as is the case at the Grand Pacific) for cooling off at the end of a busy day! Apologies for the lengthy commentary, but any information gained may help someone with their travel plans!

Singapore Airlines then had a $1 / night stopover deal, so I was able to cancel my original booking and re-book (all online) for $AUD3 including hotel and all the stopover vouchers. The hotel is very well located. It only took us about 30 minutes to walk slowly down through the City Hall area to Raffles Landing Place on the river. There are many conveniences near the hotel, including a 7-11 right next door open 24 hours for all your essentials (making for a cheap snack or breakfast option too). Even though we arrived at the hotel after 2:00pm, our room wasn't ready and the reception staff were not very useful in letting us know how long it would be for the room to be ready - they just told us to take a seat. After 30 minutes of now news, we left out bags to start exploring the city as we only had 24 hours in Singapore. Other than this small disappointment, our room was OK - not flash, bit dated, tight squeeze for a triple but remember this was only a stopover, even at the normal price I understand this is good value for Singapore and the location was good. We were leaving at 5pm the following day. The hotel kindly held our bags and allowed us to shower and change in the pool shower (with use of the pool towels). No need for late checkout especially given we were out for most of the day.

The deal included airport transfers and a half-day city tour and one nights free accommodation. When I arrived at the hotel, the concierge on the 1st floor (Ground floor for Oz travellers) offered to hold my luggage whilst I checked-in at reception which was up the escalator on the 2nd floor (1st floor). The receptionist was quite indifferent, unforunately. She hardly looked at me and I had difficulty understanding her English (probably my fault there). So I refrained from asking her too many questions. However, the process was quick and efficient. I discovered that I was upgraded to a Premier room as there weren`t any smoking rooms available for my 5 day stay. As mentioned in previous reviews, the smoking floor hallway had a strong residual aroma of smoke, but surprisingly not in the room. The room was on the 8th floor and had a view to the south where I could see a quarter of the Flyer thru the vista of skyscrapers. It was well appointed, functional and very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The room-controlled air-con provided a wonderful refuge from the oppressive heat that Singapore can provide. The hotel pool was also a welcome relief. Accessed from the 5th floor corridor, you take the outside stairs down to level 4. It`s mostly exposed to the sun but there are areas of shade and blue pool towels are available for guests. Daytours from Allson may mean a pickup from outside the adjoining hotel at the rear - Hotel Royal @ Queens. It backs on to the Allson and is on Queen St. Access is thru the sliding doors on the reception level past the tour desk. This also makes it convenient if you`re going to visit places north of Victoria St. There is an evening bar on this level as well. As a guest, I was able to enjoy the breakfast buffet at half-price (SGD18) in the hotel`s Caf\u00e9 Fontainebleau which also operates buffets for lunch and dinner - plus set menus. The staff there are very welcoming and attentive. The food was varied and plentiful. Western and Asian palates are catered for, but the quality I`d say was only average. There is another, more formal and upmarket, restaurant attached to the hotel as well. My accommodation deal afforded me the slightly later checkout time of midday. It also provided the option of an even later checkout (up to 4pm) subject to Allson`s availablilty. As I was not departing for the airport until 6pm, I requested this option the day before and reception graciously allowed me a 3pm checkout. The TV even counted down before switching off 25 mins before checkout time. It certainly gave me a hurry on. They have a luggage holding system and they also advised that there were shower facilities available for checked-out guests before their departure from the hotel. As I was fortunate to receive an upgrade from my booked Deluxe room, a lot of my expectations were often surpassed in that capacity. But the general service, facilities and features of the hotel were excellent. Its location is practically perfect. So when you look at all the Allson has to offer, it is extremely good value. I`d certainly stay there again and would definitely recommend it to others\u2026 even without a special deal.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cVery good location, friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "Sue1107", "ReviewID": "UR50331771", "Content": "We arrived fairly early in the morning and were greeted by very friendly staff.

Lucky we went then. Singapore International Airlines (SIA) has since suspended flights from Vancouver effective April 2009. We initially checked the Trip Advisor rating of each of the hotels offered on the package. Allson Hotel had both the best TA rating and the most reasonable price. As first time visitors to Singapore we quickly realized that the Allson was the best location we could have chosen. The famous Raffles Hotel was only a block away, and offered a stop for the SIA hop-on / hop-off bus. Our package included two days worth of free hopping on and off. Two round trips on the SIA bus with the maps they supplied gave us our bearings for the rest of our stay. Our SIA boarding pass also provided for a wide range of further shopping and attraction discounts during our stay. Every morning the door men gave us very helpful suggestions for our shopping and exploring. The Allson is a SIA stop-over hotel. This really means 24 hour service. Our flight was a couple of hours late, making our check-in 2:30 am. Absolutely no problem! Our bags were taken to the room and we were given a quick lesson on use of the room card for both the electricity in our room and for the elevator. There never was hitch in the operation of the three elevators serving us. The in-room safe was easy to use. Our bed was comfortable and we were amazed at how quiet the room was (12th floor) for being in the centre of the City. Large bathroom, adequate furniture, TV, small fridge and coffee maker were handy. The hotel internet was SD20 per day. We just used it once as it turned out we could get free WIFI at a McDonald's a block away. Breakfast was included in our package and included a wide range of delicious western and asian foods. A 24 hour food court is adjacent to the hotel and offers at least eight various asian cuisines. Our favourite was the dim sum. SIA has a tour operator in the hotel which is very handy. He suggested we obtain tickets for the CHINGAY PARADE which is the largest Spring Festival event in Asia. We ended up above the Prime Minister's reviewing stand with an excellent view of the whole parade. WOW!!! We walked from the hotel down to China Town for the arrival of Chinese New Year's. Again WOW!! - largely due to the loudest fireworks we've ever encountered. The hotel was a convenient pick-up spot for the tours we booked. The hotel is just north of the Singapore Business University. The shopping centre across the street from the hotel has several floors of new and used books. Little India and the Malay quarter are only a few blocks away. The gigantic electonics building is only a couple of blocks away. There are hundreds of restaurants and food courts within a few blocks of the Allson. There is also a 24 hour 7/11 adjacent to the hotel. Handy for drinks, etc. We used the 4th floor swimming pool almost every day. For anyone wishing a touch of the sun, it shines through a gap in the surrounding hi-rises from about 10:30 am to 1 pm .People told us that a couple days was more than enough for a visit to Singapore. They were wrong! We look forward to visiting Singapore again to see all the things we missed this time. Shall only hope we can arrange a stay at the Allson again, and that SIA resumes service again from Vancouver.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, South Australia", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't be in a better location....\u201d", "Author": "MustangFrank", "ReviewID": "UR23447948", "Content": "Wife and I went from Australia to Singapore with another couple to do something different for birthday and wedding anniversaries that came up in the first two weeks of 2009. The hotel was chosen by our travel agent as an affordable place to stay, within walking distance of several major shopping centres and eateries. The location in the Singapore CBD was perfect, with a money changer and a 24-hour 7 Eleven next door at the left of the hotel and a large open-air food court to the immediate right. It is just a 5-minute walk to the famous Raffles Hotel and about 15-minutes to the Bugis Street markets and Bugis Junction shopping centre. A cab ride to Chinatown is about $5... actually, nowhere in Singapore is much more than about $10 to $15 by cab and there seems to be more cabs than other cars in the city. I agree with the comments about noise transmission in the Allson. It seems to have been built in two phases ... the original building of solid brick with excellent noise insulation and a high-rise extension with walls of timber studding and plasterboard. Yes, you can hear water running in the pipes when someone showers but not much else. Besides, after a few of those big 633 mil Tiger beers at the food court next door, you won't hear much for the rest of the night:) The full breakfast in the dining room is excellent. if you're lucky, your deal included vouchers for free breakfasts. If not, your travel agent can arrange a 50% discount. That makes all you can eat of Asian and/or Western food for $15 per head...plus 10% service charge, plus 7% GST, which is the norm in Singapore. Truly excellent value and if you eat late and stuff yourself enough, you really don't need lunch. The reception girls are a bit cold but they lighten up if you crack a few funnies. As for the indian/Malay lobby porters - well, what can you say... excellent service, helpful tips - especially from big Mano who is a bit of a legend in the place. Nothing was too hard for him and I hope they give the guy a big pay rise as he did all he could to make our stay very enjoyable. The pool area was basic but very relaxing, with a dozen high-quality lounge chairs to laze about on, plus outdoor seating settings with big umbrellas. The pool was perfectly clean. Allson has an excellent policy of allowing check-out as late as 1:00pm and even when you've left your room, they let you leave your bags in the foyer holding area as long as you like (our airport shuttle wasn't due to collect us till 8:15pm for our return flight.) Also, you can get an electronic key to visit the pool area and use the showers ... this is after you've left the hotel! That's pretty good in my book. Overall, it was excellent for the four of us. The aircon and fridge both worked well and we had a great view. Our rooms did have a few quality issues with materials like ceiling paint flaking away, etc, and the hot water service was struggling a bit to get a good flow to the 16th floor - but if you want 5-star, you gotta pay for it. As a place to crash after walking 10km for the day, sinking a bunch of Tiger beers and stuffing yourself with chilli crab, who needs anything better?

On arrival at 8am we were received by surly, unhelpful reception staff. We were told to come back at 10am and given a voucher for a free tea or coffee at the buffet restaurant. After availing ourselves of the freebie we still had 90 mins to kill so went for a walk. Arriving back at 10am we went back to reception and asked if our room was ready \"no,no not ready yet, come back later\" I explained that I had been told our room would be available at 10am so grudgingly they checked and lo and behold our room was ready. Our first room was fine and I really can't complain about it exept that the Singapore stopover rep rang us at 8.15am to ask us to meet with him after breakfast. Then the restaurant rang us at 8.50am to talk us into going down for the buffet breakfast at half price. We had ordered breakfast to have in the room but decided to take them up on their offer. Big mistake, I have never seen such an unappetising mish-mash of food and I am not a fussy eater. In the end we just had poached eggs on toast at 15 dollars each which is what we had ordered in the first place and would have been cheaper in the room. Then it was off to meet the rep to find out what was so important that he had to ring us at 8.15am. He told us what time the coach would be picking us up the next day! and tried to sell us some excursions, which of course was the real reason we were there. After a visit to KFC (beware, if you order a \"meal\" it doesn't come with chips, you have to order them seperately !!??) we found that we couldn't get into our room, I went to reception and explained our predicament, they looked at me as if I was stupid, fiddled with the key card and sent me back to try it again. No joy, back to reception, more looks of disdain. This time they sent the manager up to try the keycard and show me what an idiot I was. I was highly delighted when after many attempts he had to admit it didn't work and called for the engineer. We ate our cold KFC and waited for the engineer, who fixed the door lock but then the electricity didn't work. We waited for the second engineer. Eventually we had power and were able to get into our room but it was too late to go out by then anyway. Our second room, on the return journey was on the 7th floor and was a twin smoking room, they said it was all they had. As soon as the lift doors opened the stink hit us, it was absolutely vile. If I had known how bad it was going to be I would never have accepted the room. The room itself was old and not at all like the first one, badly in need of refurbishment and fumigating. We were called in the morning again by the rep just before 9am. We decided to give the breakfast a miss. On checkout, reception staff weren't too bad.

We were very happy with our choice and mentioned to each other a number of times that we'd stay there again if we were transiting through Singapore. The hotel is extremely well located, with train stations and major shopping districts only a few minutes walk away. We did nearly all of our Singapore sightseeing on foot from the hotel, where you can easily walk to Raffles, the Marina, the Esplanade, Suntec City, and heaps and heaps of shopping centres. Bugis Village and Bugis Junction take less than 5 minutes to walk to. Plus there is an awesome hawker centre next door (Victoria Street Food Centre), which is lively and has heaps of cheap and very delicious foods on offer! The hotel may be a little tired, but it was immaculately clean and very comfortable. Beds and pillows were comfortable, and you have the option of requesting privacy in your room if you're just too tired to go out and you don't want housekeeping to disturb you. Floor 11 is non-smoking which was perfect for us. And despite its city location, you don't hear any street noise and the blockout curtians meant we were easily able to nap during the day after arriving on a redeye flight. Reception were fairly friendly, though when we checked in early after that redeye flight, were were told we could check in from 9am and when we went to the desk, we were told the rooms were not yet ready, but they'd let us know. They didn't - I kept an eye on things myself. That was the only negative bit. Concierge and the doormen were friendly and polite, helped with bags and were happy to give directions to the sights and shops. Restaraunt staff were great. We had breakfast in the restaurant just to save time looking elsewhere and got a 50% reduction because we were hotel guests, and the western and local options easily kept us going until lunchtime. As an aside, the Singapore Stopover holiday is brilliant - free transfers to and from the airport, major discount at the hotel (we payed less than $100 per day), and lots of free tickets to local attractions. A few reviews on here complained about musty smells, small bathrooms and inattentive staff, but I've had worse at 5 star hotels in Australia.

Our experience at this hotel was OK. Here are some observations. 1. The location was excellent - conveniently located between 2 MRT stations Bugis and City Hall. It is approx. a 5 minute walk to either stations from the hotel. 2. If you chose not to eat at the hotel, there is a small hawker centre located just beside the hotel and another right across from the hotel. There are also restaurants and a food court at Bugis Junction. There is also a 7-Eleven right beside the hotel for quick snacks, drinks etc. 3. We were given a room with a \"queen sized\" bed beside an elevator. Unfortunately, we were not comfortable due to a noisy elevator and an uncomfortable bed. We asked to be transferred to another room. The receptionist, without smiling, promptly informed us that this couldn't be done tonight because there were no more rooms and that we had to come back tomorrow. We returned the following day with the request. It was done but quite mechanically-no warm friendly smile. We were just glad we were transferred to another room with twin beds and away from the elevator! Thankfully, we didn't have to deal with reception again till we checked out. 4. An annoyance was that the key card reader was not working properly in the elevator. This resulted in having to insert the key card again..and again..hoping that it works. 5. The room was very basic-no iron, no ironing board, no robes, no slippers. At least there was a safe! There was a note posted by the coffee/tea/mugs/kettle that indicates that if you wanted to request more coffee/tea, that you will be charged $1.00 for additional packets. Thought that was quite odd. The rosewood furniture was lovely and added a nice touch to the room. The bathroom was tiny but at least it was clean. 6. Housekeeping staff were friendly and ensured that the rooms and bathroom were kept clean. They also ensured that the amenities were stocked. 7. There is not much a pool and a gym at this hotel. We didn't bother using these facilities anyway. So, if you are looking to swim laps or get in a work-out or two, you will be disappointed. There are no free weights in the gym. A good point is that there is a self-serve laundry facility on site. 8. Staffwise-other than Housekeeping, the only other person that seemed to be friendly and cheerful was the person operating the tour desk. All in all, an OK hotel to stay at.

The strong points of the hotel are: 1. The hotel is conveniently located on a main thoroughfare, within walking distance of many of the center-city attractions of Singapore. It is a 10-minute walk to the Suntec Convention Centre, where I was attending a conference. 2. With the exception of a few problems at Reception, described below, services such as housekeeping and laundry were very friendly and reliable. 3. Guests rooms are very clean but noticeably worn in places: e.g., chipped, scratched furniture, cracked light switch. 4. Internet access - The hotel has good wired internet access in the rooms, although it can be noticeably slower during peak access times. At approximately US$ 13.70 per day, it is a little pricey on the worldwide scale, but not outrageous. The access port is controlled by the Front Desk and service can be purchased for the entire stay. This eliminates the need for passwords and avoids the too-hasty time-outs that one often encounters in hotel internet services. 5. The hotel has a swimming pool and workout facilities. 6. As one would expect in a Singapore hotel, staff appear to be genuinely friendly. There are several weak points that would make me think twice about returning to this hotel if comparable or better accommodations were available elsewhere: 1. Front Desk / Reception should be the strongest part of a hotel experience. At the Allson it is the weakest. I had annoying problems both at check-in and check-out. a. I was not given the type of room that I had booked, due in part to the lack of information that expedia.com had provided to the hotel; however, I was moved the next morning. b. The hotel's card reader was not working properly, which resulted my having to trudge about the streets of Singapore, at 2:00 a.m. after a 30-hour airplane journey, in search of an ATM, so that I could pay a cash deposit (obtained with the same card that would not work at the hotel) and check in. c. Upon departure, I requested a copy of my bill in advance, but the Reception clerk refused to present one until check-out. There is no video review of one's account or video checkout. d. Although it did not affect my departure, Reception appears to be understaffed during peak periods, as evidenced by significant lines between 1000 and the hotel's 1100 checkout time. e. Otherwise, Reception staff were professional and responsive. 2. Restaurant - Like most hotel buffets, the Allson's is best avoided except in a last resort. The breakfast buffet is of average quality and variety, but not nearly worth the US$ 24 price. The 50% discount for hotel guests, before tax and service charge, helps to bring the price more in line with the value delivered. I noticed that people staying on a package tour received breakfast included. The better alternative, if one has time, is to try the many cafes, coffee shops, and 24-hour eateries all within one block of the hotel. 3. Guest rooms - My \"executive room\" was very clean but also very sparse in terms of amenities: very old hair dryer, no iron or ironing board, small work table, only one arm chair. The room did have a mini-bar / refrigerator that was lightly stocked. The room was of adequate size, but not spacious. 4. Bellman / porter / concierge services are understaffed and usually non-existent. Bottom line: The Allson is definitely second tier among Singapore hotels -- maybe even third -- and noticeably below the quality and features of the larger, better-known hotels nearby. It is also noticeably below them in price.

The pool area looked quite lovely, however not convenient to get to (down to the 3rd or 4th floor, down the corridor past the other rooms, out the door, down some steep spiral stairs and then to the pool). We spent most of our time outside walking around town to be bothered by the confinement of the rooms. The service was friendly expecially from the gents at the Concierge desk. Manu was a very friendly man who offered some wonderful local knowledge. We dined at Equinox on the 71st floor of the Swissotel at his recommendation. An amazing view (not revolving), delicious food, however very expensive. We had a full 3 course meal with wine and coffee and it was $530SGD. I would recommend that you visit Singapore Zoo - like no other zoo I've seen. No fences, just deep trenches filled with water separate you and the animals. Just gorgeous. The Night Safari was good, but so dark you can't see much. Still, an exciting experience to be that close to such amazing animals. We did High Tea at Raffles which was stunning! However, do not eat a big breakfast/lunch or plan a large dinner - there is so much food and so much more than just cucumber sandwiches and scones. The food was spectacular and it just kept coming. We were there for 3 hours and were stuffed full. We also had Singapore Slings/G&T's at the Long Bar of Raffles. A wonderful experience to just sit back and sip on a drink, eat some peanuts and discuss the day. Take a walk through the entire Civic District (Raffles and the Allson are in it) as it has beautiful old world charm. To get around town I advise you use the clean and efficient service provided by the train system. On time, cheap and regular services ensure you can get where you want with the least amount of fuss. Boat Quay is a must with a fantastic variety of restaurants. Don't stop at the first one you find, some of the better ones are in towards the middle. Also try to do a boat ride on the river at night. Suntec City is pretty amazing to walk around as is Chinatown. Go to Chinatown in the late afternoon to get its full benefit. Orchard Rd is great if you want to shop - very westernised shopping district with all the big brand names you would expect in Sydney/Melbourne/London/LA etc. Not really what I came to Singapore for, although we did get 2 suits made for my husband from Christian Armani which is in Scott's Mall off Orchard Road. Very well made and excellent service - about 1/2 the price we would have paid in Australia. Overall, we had a magnificent time in Singapore, not long enough though. The Allson Hotel provided us with a good, clean hotel which was very accommodating and so close to everything it made the whole trip worthwhile. I would highly recommend this hotel for those who don't mind a smaller room and who will be spending a lot of time out sight seeing.", "Date": "April 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "clandite", "ReviewID": "UR7269613", "Content": "stayed here for one week no complaints,nice and central nearest mrt station five minutes walk lot's of food outlets nearby,nice comfortable room and good hot working shower,special mention for the concierge had an evening flight and they stored luggage no hastle and pre ordered a taxi to take me to the airport which arrived bang on time.", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel\u201d", "Author": "briztraveller", "ReviewID": "UR6802983", "Content": "I stayed at the Allson for 2 nights with my family on the way to Australia.

Also we asked for a room for 3 adults. We got a double room with a spare bed put inbetween the other two beds with no gaps inbetween. Result, extremely squashed up, only one person could walk in the room at a time. There was drilling etc work going on next door and it began at 6 in the morning. Very noisy.
