When put on Max, the temperature would probably get 5 degrees cooler than the room temp. - The TV was completely broken. - The phone barely worked. You had to keep your head still in one position. - So much noise in the middle of the night. Airplanes, and oh my goodness - stray cats, ... - Breakfast was okay considering how awful the hotel was.

I would like to recommend Dream palace hotel , UAE (Deira) for the following reason - quite budget, compared with other brand new / chain hotel - location is good, near MRT, not far from Airport by Taxi (40 Dh , actually it might just 20 Dir but taxi from airport will charge 20 Dh extra) - free shuttle bus (return to Airport) , really it's free (see the timing from the photo) - near Reef Mall , the mall is just behind you can buy anything you want (supermarket & mall) - 250 metre to metro station Salah Al Din (Green line), see the photo that i will post - No disco in this hotel so you can sleep without annoyance Something you may not prefer; - Not allow to check in before 1 pm even 5 minutes, even the room is available, you have to wait until it is 1 pm - The room has no window, i guess because it's country of dessert so they prefer constructing the building like this - Internet was not free This hotel is a bit old from the building but i think they renovate inside, bathroom (shower, hair dryer, bath tube) is very good. Since there are many new hotels in Dubai esp. brand or chain hotel, the price of this hotel is a bit cheaper than others but it's all i need. I did not expect a 5 star service, i just want t good place to sleep , so i don't mind if i will not be called every 5 mins \"how are you sir / mam?\" (which is a norm of 5 star hotel!) When i search for hotel, i found some cheaper nearby but the hotel has disco in ground floor and many people commented that it's loudly until 3 am, even some say many girl service (prostitutes) available. I am a lady travel alone so i want to avoid such environment. Before i have experience, staying in a hotel that has disco and men always look at women in a bad way.......and if you are in gulf, you will understand the attitude of men toward non-Arab women , which i hate that too much so i find a hotel that without such environment. One thing makes me surprised is the maintenance available at 11 pm. By that time the small shower is broken from the reel, i just called reception and expected that they would just turn off the valve. But he said the maintenance staff is available, and they change it for me within 5 10 minutes (from a call - come to the room - go out to take a new reel and change), very impressive. But if you expect a very new room, trendy design, you con consider other hotel, surely in higher price. Be aware that hotel in Dubai will include more 20 percent from the price show in your booking (10 + 10).", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire UK", "Title": "\u201cDream Palace\u201d", "Author": "TimboHertfordshireUK", "ReviewID": "UR121389407", "Content": "I stayed at the Dream Palace from 26th November 2011 to 2nd December 2011.

I paid around $17USD per day for Internet but had low to no connectivity in my room. The staff repeatedly told me to take my laptop to the front desk (because there was more connectivity on the ground floor) and would never send anyone to check the connectivity in my room. The Internet in my room never worked, and I ran through at least 15 passwords. Even if the Internet had worked, the continual need to obtain new passwords would have been maddening. The staff became hostile about the Internet issue and said that, if I did not pay for the Internet, the cost of it would be deducted from their paychecks. I finally gave up on the Internet altogether and was still charged for it. I had no hot water for two days. After several requests, the staff turned on the hot water by removing a ceiling panel in the bathroom. The panel was never replaced, leaving a 2' by 2' hole in the ceiling above the bath tub. Anything could have fallen on me. No one ever replaced the panel. The bathroom grout was moldy. The bathtub was so small that no one could sit in it. The television image was pink, wavy and blotchy. The beds and pillows were unbearably hard. I could not sleep well at all. One of my breakfasts was quite good, and the rest were so-so.

The hotel is magnificent with fresh interiors, nice and clean bed linens, towels etc. & very good bathrooms. We stayed on 5th Floor in Deluxe double room, which has different scheme from other floors. We were just expecting a few nibbles but breakfast is a lovely continental spread with cheeses fruits, cakes, Arab breads etc. The location of the hotel is in Deira Dubai, which is old Dubai. Right around the hotel there are two good Malls, many super stores, good restaurants only 3-5 minutes walking distance. Gold Souk is also quite near, 10-15 minutes by taxi ( there is always traffic Jam when you go towards that area) There is nearby metro station on Al Rigga road from where you have options to go to new Dubai, Mall of emirates, Airport by paying merely 6-9 dirham. The hotel staff is very co-operative and courtious. I needed an adopter for my camera charger, which was arranged within a short time. My return flight back was scheduled at 22:40,but hotel people allowed me to stay in the hotel upto 18:00 without any extra charges. However the hotel transport from and to airport was through an old bus without curtain, which posed a problem during day time when the sun was at its peak on our way from airport to hotel. Since the distance of airport from the hotel is not much, the hotel could have arranged a car. Overall I would say this is probably the best hotel in 3 star category we have ever stayed in on holiday.

The staff even let me use the internet in the lobby for about 10 minutes without an additional payment. A small pool and jacuzzi on the roof. The gym is very basic, but has 1 or 2 treadmills. There is even a sauna...very nice after a long day on the town. I travel through Dubai frequently, sometimes with a company paid hotel (which the Dream Palace is not on their list..it should be).
