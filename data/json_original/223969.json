I believe it was in part because I had stayed there in the past, had a great experience, but I never really had a chance to write a review. Out of the Terminal, I waited for about 7 min for the hotel shuttle bus which I easily recognized. The hotel being just about a mile away from MIA, I barely had time to sit that we were already pulling into the complex where 2 or more others hotels from the Marriott family are located. And just as I was expecting it, I quickly recognized the friendly and warm welcome at the front desk. The check-in was fast and efficient, and I was in my room in no time. The room looked spacious, clean and well decorated. There was a nice sofa next to the bed, though I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need it, it added a charm in the room. I had a king size bed just like I requested and was happy with it. The bathroom was also clean and spacious with a tub and a huge mirror. I had a very quiet night and woke up refreshed! Additionally, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the things that I really appreciated in this hotel, I had ordered few stuff online to be delivered at the hotel before even I checked-in, stuff that I wanted to take them with me to Europe. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all went very well; once I identified myself to the security from my room, they had my stuff brought up to my room like an express delivery. The only negative point that I noted was a small leak from the A/C in the room right in front of the bathroom entrance. There was water coming out of the A/C, making the carpet a bit wet, not a major issue but enough to be noticed. Since I was only spending one night and needed just a great night sleep, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me at all as I was totally satisfied with my night. Overall, I had a great experience, just like the previous one, and would definitely go back if I have a chance.

It appears that some parts of the hotel are newer than others it is obvious there are updating rooms and I don't mean construction you can just see the differences. If I have any complaint it is that there are no refrigerators or safes in the room. On my second visit I would have gotten my leftovers to go from the restaurant but with no refrigerator I would not be able to store them. As for the staff they were very helpful. Danny B was beyond helpful when the printer was broken. He made sure my document was not going to print later and then assisted me with printing at the front desk. The only time I had a problem was later in the evening on my first visit I went on a hunt for a soda and they do not have soda machines in the hotel instead they have a small shop by the front desk. I am ok with this however the clerk working was by herself and so busy she did not have the ability to ring me up, I finally left and went back to my room still thirsty.

Unfortunately, the Courtyard is not as good. The front desk staff is courteous and the rooms are nice and comfortable. Unfortunately, the property is terribly noisy (there wasn\u00c2\u00b4t a single night when I wasn\u00c2\u00b4t woken up either by noisy room neighbors (REALLY noisy) or by people on the corridors (guess walls and doors are made our of cardboard). One night I was even woken by the smell of heavy cigarette smoke in my room, coming from the bathroom vent. Why was I even advised it was a non smoking hotel, if when I call the front desk to complain I\u00c2\u00b4m solely told \"I\u00c2\u00b4ll let the manager know\" (???). Another separate issue is housekeeping in this property. t\u00c2\u00b4s terrible. Worst I\u00c2\u00b4ve ever experienced. On the first week of my stay, they took a shirt I was sleeping in with the linens. And I\u00c2\u00b4m not talking of a white shirt. It had different colors so it would have been clearly visible on my bed if there had been careful housekeeping. But the worst part is that I asked the front desk to have someone look in the linens chute or ask the cleaning company to look for it and never heard back. One day, coming back in the hotel, I asked them if there had been any news. My complaint was not even there, it had never been filed. Of course, by that time it was too late to look, so they asked their \"operations manager\", and the next day they left me a voicemail saying they hadn\u00c2\u00b4t found anything. Of course. So, I lost my shirt and nobody even offered to compensate in ANY way. But the housekeeping chapter doesn\u00c2\u00b4t end here. They NEVER, not one single day, clean inside the shower (and God knows about the rest of the bathroom). I was leaving little empty conditioner bottles in there, to see if they at some point cleaned them up, and when it got up to 4, i threw them out myself because it made me sick to thing they weren\u00c2\u00b4t not only not cleaning, but also not even looking at the shower, because you could clearly see the empty bottles and old soap through its glass. They never changed the soap, and rarely vacuum cleaned the room. Some of the sheets had stains and the blanket had holes. If a piece of paper fell on the floor next to the desk, it could be left there for days (I started leaving these kind of small tests behind to see if they were cleaning at all). One day they didn\u00c2\u00b4t even leave towels in the bathroom, so I had to get dressed when I got back at about 10 pm and was about to jump in the shower, to call the front desk and have toweld be brought up to my room. When I did, they even asked me how many I needed (just the ones housekeeping should have left in my room!!!). Good for short stays, not so good for long business stays when you need to get good rest and exceptional service.

We selected it based on its close proximity to a 2-day seminar we were attending in Coral Gables. It's right off of the main highway, and located on the same property with two other Marriott brand hotels (I think!). The lobby and downstairs area was gorgeous - modern decor with large flat screen tv's playing, lots of seating, and computer stations with large, sleek monitors and free wi-fi. Danny at the front desk was great. The first room we got was on the second floor, right next to the elevator. It had a loud humming noise and the whole room was vibrating. There was no way we would have been able to sleep with that, so I called down & Danny gave us another room with no problem. This one was on the 3rd floor at the end of the hall by the stairway. It was much better in that it was quiet, but here's a few things I didn't like about it: - There was no fan in the bathroom, so the steam just stayed in there after taking a shower. - The friggin bathroom door automatically closes by itself and has no doorstop, so I had to prop it open with the clothes drying rack thing I found in the closet in order to air it out. - The water didn't drain well during my shower, so I was standing in an ankle-deep puddle the whole time. - The room had no mini-fridge. - I'm sure many people like a firm mattress, but for me it was too firm. I no likey! - The hotel IS close to the airport, so we did hear some planes, but honestly they weren't bothersome. On an up note, the room was decorated nicely and it had a large, flat screen tv with Direct TV. Other than that, we wanted to call & order take out from the restaurant downstairs (I think it's called Champions Sports Bar). However, there was no menu in the room (HEL-LO?!), so we went downstairs to place our order and then waited in the lobby area. As I said before, it's very nice, but the AC had to be set at like 50 degrees because we were FREEZING! All in all, it was fine for that one night, but I probably wouldn't stay there again. P.S.

I stay exclusively at Marriotts and travel frequently so I feel I am a good judge of it. First the good: 1) I was concerned about airplane noise keeping the kids awake because we are right next to the runway. However, it was not a concern at all. Windows are well insulated and even though the planes fly right by the building, you can't hear them at all. Thus sleep concerns are not an issue. 2) We had a 1-bedroom suite. It was fine, the kitchen was nice actually. Clean and all modern equipment (fridge, stove, dishwasher, etc.). Nice marble counter tops. Very nice look too. 3) good for family The improvement portion: 1) room service must skip the even numbered rooms cause they never stopped by our room to clean anything, though they did adjacent rooms. Could have been just an oversight - mistakes happen, no big deal. 2) front desk personnel were kind of off - one was grumpy, the other one did not conduct herself to the level of professionalism I have come to expect from Marriott. I'm not asking to have my feet kissed or anything, but a little professional courtesy would be nice. If Bill Marriott came in, he'd probably would have fired them on the spot. 3) the room was obviously cleaned, but there was long black hair everywhere, possibly by the cleaning person. Kinda nasty.

The area is in a not so great area, but the hotel is on a campus of a full Marriott, a Residence Inn, Courtyard and Fairfield Inn. The lobby includes a touch screen board that is interactive and can help with restaurants, directions and other information. The only minor complaints are: access from the exit ramp from the Expressway going W. does not allow you to make a left turn from a multi-lane busy highway into the driveway, and you have to go one or more blocks around to get to the driveway which is gated and controlled by the room key. There is a lot of traffic during rush hours. The other complaint is the water is not hot enough during the evening when everyone is using hot water.

We paid $120 with tax which we thought was a very reasonable price for such a new and sparkling hotel. There was a Champion's Restaurant on the ground floor which served a great cheeseburger. The check-in team was upbeat and perky. The room was in perfect condition with the exception of the air conditioning system needing some adjustment.

The pool opened just a few hours before we checked it out and it was nice. A tad on the small side (is shared by the Courtyard and the adjacent Marriott) and the jacuzzi looked a bit dingy, but the new landscaping and patio area were extremely well-done and inviting. We also liked the shuttle from the airport and the shuttle to the cruise terminals that were complimenary. The front desk was very courteous and helpful in arranging transportation. We used the fitness facility which was absolutely top-notch; each bike, treadmill, and cross-trainer had their own personal TV's that you could plug your headphones into which made working out much more enjoyable. There was also fresh fruit, water, and towels available. As we were heading out from our stay, we ran into J.W.

Well the night I arrive, the sheet was too small to be tucked in on either side of the bed. So during the night, it kept coming up and I ended up on that nasty pad. I did tell the front desk about the problem and they told the maids to put a bigger sheet on my bed.
