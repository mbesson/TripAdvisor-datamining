There were no drink making facilities which is poor when there is no restaurant or bar. The management could not supply a kettle to make a drink late at night. When I bought a flask to obtain hot water to make a drink, it was brought to the room 2 hours after the request at 1am, when we had fallen asleep. Service??? The next night we were told it was impossible to supply hot water. On a more serious note, the automatic fire doors were jammed open by fire extinguishers and heavy weights, as the magnetic releases were unserviceable. This meant that if a fire caught and set the alarm off the doors would not close and would let the fire spread. I will say, however, the location of the hotel was first class; near to the main rail and bus station and that I had a great weekend, just picked the wrong hotel in the area.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "MickeSweden", "ReviewID": "UR122909205", "Content": "A simple hotel, with a good location just a few minutes walk from Roma Termini.

The first room I was put in had a leaking radiator in the bathroom. A very rude receptionist refused to put me in another room unless he goes to the room and checks the leak. No apologies and after the inspection I was moved to a twin rather than a double room which I paid for. The floor in the bathroom of the new room was dirty and sticky. The walls in the room were dirty and seriously require a proper painting. I was afraid to complain as the receptionist was so rude already I did not want to end up with no accommodation in Rome at all. The room was overlooking something like a banquet hall from where, if I opened a window, someone could probably enter my room (fortunately they haven't had any events going on).

Not only was it easy to find but it turned out to be in a very good location. If you like to stay in a busy neighborhood, this hotel is not for you. But if you prefer a quiet area, this is it. Even though there are tons of hotels in the streets nearby, since there is no real touristy stuff to do here, it's very quiet at night. There are enough decent restaurants around. No gourmet stuff but ok. It's 5 minutes from the station and all the buses and the subway. Rome being a rather small city, you can walk from the hotel to the Colosseo in about 25 min. There is a supermarket just across the Piazza Indipendenza, if you need drinks or food. The internet is also a 2 min walk. And there is a good restaurant, Florian's, on the Piazza also. Good food, especially the pesto trofie! I don't know about the other rooms but mine was the smallest I've ever seen. I have to say that I was in shock when I first saw it but you get used to it very quickly and you don't go to Rome to stay in your room! Yes, it was small but the room was well equipped and it was fine for my needs. Don't expect anything modern, the decoration is quite dated and the walls need a fresh coat of paint. But everything was clean. If you're a bigger person, forget this place. I had to walk sideways to get to the toilet and the shower... The breakfast was fine for me. Not 30 choices of food but how much do you need? Coffee, croissants, cheese, eggs, salami, cereals, bread, Nutella, yogourt, more than enough. The staff was nice. It seems that the same guy works there 24/7 but apparently he's not fed ud, and always answers your questions, gives you map, tell you where to get the internet. The only things is that there is nowhere to sit outside your room (in my room, I couldn't sit at all except on my bed!). There is some kind of living room in the basement but it's not very inviting and I never saw anyone there even if the hotel was full. If you go to your hotel, you're in your room, period. Don't expect anything else. The bar they mention is not a bar. Barely a counter and if you want a drink, I assume you go get the guy at reception...

Contrary to other reviews, we found all the hotel staff polite and helpful including recommending restaurants and trips to do during our stay. The hotel is fairly small but very clean and we thought the room was more than adequate. My partner is a big guy but he was comfortable enough relaxing in the room and enjoying a soak in the bath after a long day strolling through the piazzas. The rooms are traditionally decorated but for us this added to the 'Rome' experience rather than detracted from the size. Breakfast does leave a little to be desired but its continental, what more can I say, its not going to be bacon and eggs and is certainly not USA style. We had a great few days in Rome seeing the sites and with the hotel ideally located near the Termini station but in the nicer quiet side instead of the rough side it was perfect to get out and about. We also thought the restaurants in this area were good value compared to other areas of the city but do visit Piazza Navona too as the cafes there are great, just stop and take in the vibe.
