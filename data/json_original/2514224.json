Everybody loves it. The 54 is my home in London because that is exactly how I am treated, like a member of their family. I stay in hotels all over the world, and short of the Shangri La in Hong Kong, the 54 is my favourite for business and personal use. But it depends what you want in a hotel. If you want a gym, fancy restaurant, executive lounge, loyalty scheme, or any of the other trappings of the chain hotels, then look elsewhere. But I am not interested in these, nor for paying for them whether I use them or not. After 25 years of hotel life all I, and now my family, appreciate is a warm reception, a comfortable stay, a good night sleep, a shower that works, a great location, and a check in and check out experience that does not feel like queuing up at the post office at Christmas. But most of all a feeling that I am staying somewhere that I feel at home, and not a dorm with benefits. If you share these views there is no place like the 54. If they are ever booked I would rather commute (200m) than stay somewhere else. Over the decade I have stayed with the 54 I have watched a string of continuous improvements, all of which have enhanced the property without taking away the essence of a boutique hotel, and this has been good to watch, right down to this weeks security enhancements re room key operation, very innovative.

This turned out to be Room 1, which is below street level at the front of the hotel. One of the attractive features of 54 is the fact that the hotel is a quirky conversion from an elegant old town house. However, this does mean that the rooms are all individual in size and shape (or I assume so, from reading other reviews). Although our room was much larger than we expected, with a comfy sofa at the window end, the ceiling was quite low, and the room felt quite oppressive. A few mirrors might have helped to bounce the available light around (in addition to the full length mirror provided). During the day we were very aware of people walking past on the pavement at roughly our head height, and when we switched on the lights to relieve the gloom it felt like we were rather exposed despite the hessian-effect blind. The recessed spotlights were subtle, but unfortunately not practical for checking one's appearance in the mirror or applying makeup. A big plus was the comfy beds, and the room was spotlessly clean. I loved the proper hairdryer provided, and the flex was long enough to be able to see in the mirror. A morning newspaper was a nice touch, too. The ensuite bathroom was a good size, but the loo seat kept falling off its hinges. The shower was impressively powerful, and the perfect height for those of us vertically challenged, although I think anyone taller than say 5' 8\" might have had to bend their knees a little. The bath was completely surrounded by an enclosure with a sliding door, but this made it impossible to turn on the shower to warm up unless standing in the bath, or to reach in to close the plug to run a bath. The sides of the bath were also quite high which made it a little hazardous for climbing in and out when the bath was slippy. A hook neaby on which to hang the robe provided or one's towel would have been very useful. We both liked the airy lounge/bar where breakfast is served, and the location opposite the Natural History Museum was central for exploring this part of London, but quiet enough that the street/traffic noise was not excessive at night. We did get a 7.00 am wake up, though, when someone started moving what sounded like empty bottles right outside our window. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and would probably stay here again, providing we could get a room at at least street level or above.

Just walked out of either Gloucester Road or South Ken tube station and head towards Imperial College and the National History Museum. It is one of the houses opposite the road from the Museum's ice skating rink. There are running numbers on the pillars so you cannot miss it. I had a good stay at 54. No doubt about it. The location was fab. Easy access to the Tube. Near the major museums. Near a few eating places and more importantly, offering all that while not having to put up with the noise & crowds associated with Piccadily Circus, Leicester Sq or Oxford Circus hotels. Overall, the decor was simple but tasteful. I was a little surprised to see that the reception / check in counter was exactly that - a counter or a hole in the wall, merged with a small bar counter in an equally compact breakfast area. Compact is a good word to use to describe the hotel. It is obvious that the hotel was converted from a residential property - so the living room become a breakfast area / bar and various bedrooms became hotel rooms of different configuration and size. We were given a free upgrade to a deluxe room on the top floor - possibly b'cos we were staying for a few nights and there weren't many other people in the hotel due to the uncharacteristic arctic weather in London. The room (Room 24, 4th floor) was quite large by London standards and was pleasantly decorated. Nothing too fancy or over the top. Just what you would expect from a decent business or boutique hotel. I even had a view of the National History Museum and Imperial College & despite the room facing Queens Gate road, there was hardly any traffic noise. The room, especially the bathroom was a little cool but not too cold - I have stayed at other hotels where the room was warm but the bathroom was freezing. One thing to note though. The lift only goes up to the 2nd floor. So any room from nos 19 onwards would have to be accessed via a flight of stairs. Rooms 22 to 26 were accessed by yet another flight of windy (small) stairs. Also, certain rooms are along the small corridor where you can hardly walk 2 abreast e.g. room 18 or 19, so I expect those rooms to have to put up with noise from footsteps on creaky wooden floorboards. Staff seemed to be uniformly non-British and mostly fairly young. The housekeeping staff were, we suspect, nearly all E. European ladies while the reception, save that one middle-aged man in the day - were all men in their late twenties or early thirties. Mostly quite friendly, especially the chap who did the night shift. Lots of smiles and was very patient. My only wee grouse was that one young chap who did the day shift who was not very conversant, very matter-of-fact but he was nonetheless, professional and was quick with his responses. We had a good chat with the middle-aged chap at breakfast about the cold weather - he advised us to wrap up warm. Breakfast was continental. Croissants and 2 kinds of each of the following : ham, cheese, toast (white & multi-grain), yogurt, pastries and fruit. There was 3 kinds of boxed cereal but only 1 kind of milk (semi-skimmed) and 1 kind of juice (orange). So, its nothing to crow about but something light to start your day. I found the hotel rates very reasonable for what I got, albeit I did get a good promotional rate.

Much bigger as well. Almost big enough to justify the large skylight directly over the bed with only a wonkey bamboo blind to keep out daylight.

Also, for an extra small charge, you can heave breakfast in bed! That was a lovely treat! The location is great too; as we stayed right ontop of Christmas there was an ice-rink at the Natural History Museum, which is only about 5 minutes walk away. If you fancy a (naughty) mightnight snack, there are some takeaways about the same distance as well! Plenty of restaurants nearby as well if you head towards the direction of Natural History Museum.

South Ken is beautiful but pretty empty at night so be aware that walking back from the tube at night you might be one of not many people on the street. Still, never felt unsafe. 5) Just a tip to know, if you can book your cab to/from airport online it's better than booking through hotels. The hotels all rip you off and charge like 50 pounds.

We booked through a hotel website and were quoted \u00a3139 for the standard double room inclusive of continental breakfast. We must admit that some of the comments read on the Tripadvisor reviews did put some doubt as to whether we had done the right thing, but we were pleasantly surprised, and had a very comfortable and agreable stay. We travelled to the hotel by tube, alighting at Gloucester Road station. We timed our walk to the hotel to be exactly 6 minutes walking at a gentle pace, with bags to carry. We fail to understand the comments about the long distance of this hotel from the tube station! Upon arrival, we were given a choice of a smaller room facing the rear on a lower floor, or a larger room on the 4th floor facing the road. We chose the latter, and were not disappointed. There is a small lift to the second floor only, and you have two flights of stairs to the top. Unless you were serious disabled, in which case the point would be valid, we failed to see how this was a problem to some...But if this is an issue, then best to request a room up to the second floor only. Our room at the top had great views of the Natural History museum, and was pleasantly quiet and free from traffic noise. Our room had ample storage and hanging space for our evening wear (we were going to an evening 'black tie' function), and would have been ok for storing several days' worth of clothing. The room was equipped with a safe which worked perfectly, the bathroom had a large shower where one does not get bruises knocking the sides and the normal complimentary toiletries were of good quality, but please, not luxurious as some mentioned! There was ample supply of towels too. There was very efficient air conditioning which kept the room at a comfortable temperature. The bed was a large kingsize which was arguably a tad too large for the room, there was just enough space to move from one side to the other one person at a time! But this is London after all, and the property is a grand old house where all rooms were former residences, and it is normal to expect a huge variation in the size and shapes of those rooms. The bland all rooms the same the world over of large hotel chains it ain't. We found the bed ultra comfortable, but the bedding was a little too warm (big fluffy duvet) for the time of the year. A lighter version would have been perfect. The duvet was a little on the small side for the size of the bed, too, but we did not find this a problem as we spent most of our night above the covers rather than under as it was too warm to stay under! The standard of the decoration was simple, neutral, but spotless. The carpet was very clean, we did not find one stain on it. The room smelled fresh and inviting, and the free bottle water was welcome after a long and sweaty train and tube journey. We loved the snug bar/coffee lounge by the reception. We ordered a nice bottle of wine, and sipped away at it for a while reading the papers. Coffee and tea was very good too, and free all day. The wine was very reasonably priced at \u00a315 a bottle, which we thought was also cheap for London. The continental breakfast bar was ample for our needs. Finally, we paid what we were quoted, and the staff was courteous, helpful without being intrusive. The night porter was opening the door for us when we returned very late even before we had rung the bell! We would certainly return to this hotel for short stays in London, it is one of the best finds we have made in a long time.

Pros: beds and bed linens comfortable; nice soaps, lotions and shampoos; continental breakfast and beverages included in package we booked and plentiful; the breakfast guy is very service oriented; breakfast area/bar are conducive to socializing or relaxing. Cons: The biggest change we noted was the inconsistency in service. Everyone who works there is most polite, and two in particular did an outstanding job of helping us with restaurant reservations and other advice. Internet access was pricey (10 pounds per day for wired or wireless) and difficult to access. The other hesitation in our recommendation is the need for greater attention to maintenance and some upgrading of facilities. Our room safe (not big enough for a laptop if you're wondering) had a low battery. We called it to reception's attention four days in a row before it was fixed. The light over the sink kept turning on & off. The carpets are clean but starting to look worn. The mattress was starting to sag; one bathrobe had a sizeable hole in the front. The room has one undersized stool that's uncomfortable for more than the minute or so it takes to tie one's shoes. The desk surface had a lot of water stains. None of these are \"deal killers\" in and of themselves; but taken as a whole, the impression is the facilities will continue to decline between visits.

Would definately go back.", "Date": "October 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, West Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cOverated and over priced\u201d", "Author": "rej_jones", "ReviewID": "UR4018771", "Content": "Whilst the location and service of the hotel staff was very good - the overall standard and cleanliness of the hotel was very poor- decoration very scruffy, very unclean carpets- heavily soiled in the room I was allocated, lumpy beds, mouldy bathrooms- it requires its 4 star down rating.

We paid \u00a360 for a double with breakfast - which is astonishing (via Lastminute.com) - you cannot even get a scabby travel inn in London for that! The Hotel receptionist (I think he was called John) was extremely pleasant, he upgaded us free of charge. We were in Room 2 (in the Basement) - which was dark, though felt very relaxed though, had patio doors leading to terrace which let up some stairs to another roof terrace - which was very pleasant (though shared with 2 other Rooms). The Hotel on the surface is quite smart - however, there are sogns of ageing - decor is a bit rough round the edges and the carpets I do admit are stained (though most places in London are!). Our room was very noisy in the night - due to a badly fitting door which rattled. Also the cleaning staff did seem to congregate outside our room very early in the morning. Having said that, for this incredible price (Which included a very pleasant continental breakfast in a charming room) - i can only rate this as an excellent deal. If I had paid rack rate of \u00a3180 I may have had a different view. The staff were all lovely. The free tea and coffee all day is a nice touch. The location is very good for Knightsbridge, The Natural History Museum, V&A, Kensington Palace Gardens, Albert Hall etc. The nearest Tube is Gloucester Rd at 8 mins walk. Harrods is maybe 15 minutes. Knightsbridge 15 mintes. Previous reviews have said it was badly located - I'd suggest to that reviewer that they should have bought a guide book and done some research before booking a hotel in an area where you won't spend most of your time! I think the personal and individual nature of the hotel far beats many of the poorly decorated and souless chains (Radisson, Holiday inn etc. which are overpriced, poorly managed and like everywhere else in London staffed by Eastern Europeans who can barely grunt at you!). I would definitely recommend this hotel even if you didn't get such a great rate. We were shown two other rooms (a superior) and the Mega Suite (which sleeps 4) - all rooms are of the same standard, same furnishings and merely vary in size. If you are not spending much time in your room - then a standard will be absolutely fine. All bathrooms are of a similar good standard. Another bonus is the free parking if you park after 1830 midweek, 1330 on a Saturday and all day Sunday and Bank Holidays - a definite plus!", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cA nice hotel for London\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3474508", "Content": "I've traveled to London more than 30 times and have stayed everywhere immaginable. On our most recent trip for a theater holiday, my husband and I stayed at the Queensgate because of a very nice price on Expedia. The Queensgate is in South Kensington, very near my favorite museum, the V&A, so I loved the location. The hotel is in a refurbished townhouse, so it feels small and personal. The rooms were very comfortable, and I liked the modern streamlined furnishings which are so much nicer the the stuffy and not always clean furnishings in more traditional small London hotels. We were there in early April, so it wasn't high season and we arrived in the middle of the week, so the hotel wasn't terribly full. But, once the weekend arrived and the hotel was full, it had all of the same problems that every other private London hotel seems to have. They couldn't accommodate all of the guests for breakfast when they arrived, and ran out of hot water for the showers. It always amazes me that the hotel staff seems surprised by these events as they must happen every weekend, but they always seem perfectly flummoxed and have no system in place to handle things or any other recommendation than to wait an hour for hot water or for breakfast. We are taking my 73 year old mother and my 18 year old niece to London at the beginning of June and thought about staying here again, but decided against it in favor of a more traditional hotel. It's fine for experienced travelers to have to deal with a lack of hot water or a place to have breakfast, but I want my mom and niece to have a nicer experience. We decided to stay at the Best Western Hotel John Howard just down the street based on TripAdvisor recommendations which sounds like it will be a bit more professional.", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, excellent service\u201d", "Author": "quilt00", "ReviewID": "UR3345699", "Content": "My boyfriend and I spent the last 5 days of 2003 (including New Year's Eve) at the Queensgate. The hotel was amazing -- chic, cool, and comfortable. We were able to get an early check in (since our flight from NYC arrived in the morning, London-time) and they were kind enough to serve us cappacinos while we waited for our room to be ready. The breakfasts were simple, but great -- croissants, fruit, coffee and tea. Location was phenomenal -- just a few blocks from the nearest tube station (with a Starbucks and a supermarket nearby!). The rooms were small, by American standards, but beautifully done. We were in a basement room, but there was plenty of light, the room was clean, and the bathroom was gorgeous. I LOVED the Frette sheets and am saving my money to get a set for myself! The service was great -- everyone was cordial, pleasant and friendly.
