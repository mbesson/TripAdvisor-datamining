There were six of us and rather than reserve 3 rooms, we opted instead for 2 3-person apartments. What a mistake. My apartment was directly across the street from the hotel. The building was very old (which typically in a city in Rome would be fine, but this lacked any old world charm). The front door to the building is marred with graffiti. There is no elevator so bags have to be carried up the stairs, The apt. was very dark, outdated and, after dark, extremely loud. Right below our windows, are bars and restaurants that are terribly loud until the early morning hours. The apartment was very hot and we wanted to keep the windows open (since we couldn't figure out how to turn the heat down) but the noise, and lack of screens, prohibited that. The glare from the outdoor lights was also a problem but since the windows lacked shades, the only way to keep the light out is to close the shutters, resulting in a very dark room in the morning. Oh yes, the accommodation for the third person in this apartment is an extremely uncomfortable cot in the main room of the apartment. My sister's apartment was across the piazza, down the street and up 3 flights. While her apartment was updated, the building lacked an elevator and was also extremely loud at night. The lack of an elevator was a problem on Sunday morning when we left since there is no hotel staff available until after 8:00 a.m. to help with the bags. They had to carry 5 bags down 3 flights of stairs. The bottom line is that we paid for a hotel experience. What we got was, in my mind, a bait and switch. Dumpy apartments, separate from the hotel, without any hotel amenities at all. In re-reading some of the ratings on this site, I'm amazed to read that there is a rooftop terrace and food available.

Due to the age/location of the building, the bedrooms are quite small but are well equipped with modern bathrooms. Due to the roof terrace and number of sites in the local area, not much time is spent in the rooms meaning the size is definitely adequate for most.

The breakfast was ample, but the friendly lady serving could have done with a bit more assistance as she had to refill juices, clear tables, take tea/coffee orders, etc all by herself - she coped well but sometimes there was a bit of a wait due to the lack of support.

We were (and still are) absolutely in love with this hotel.

The afternoon we arrived (tired and jet lagged), we were able to unpack, shower and walk a few steps out the door and get some fabulous Carbonara in the piazza while families and friends played and relaxed! It was truly an Italian experience. In addition to the excellent location, the rooms were great. We had a double/queen sized bed and separate bath. We loved the decor - it was very \"Roma\". The room and bathroom was very clean. There was a flat-screen TV and alarm clock and a window over looking the terrace. It was the perfect room to unwind after a long day touring Rome. The staff was very nice and offered many times to schedule tours and reservations for us. They gave us great suggestions of traditional eateries that were off the beaten \"tourist\" path. I truly believe that they would have done just about anything for us! We spoke very little Italian and the staff was so accommodating with their English. We found the price to be very reasonable considering the location and room appointments. As a side note, we flew into Rome airport and took the train into Rome city. We then attempted to walk the mile or so to the hotel, but found it too confusing and the neighborhoods a little unnerving. In the end, we hailed a taxi and were there in 5 minutes.

Have been to Rome many times and have always stayed over by the Spanish Steps. This was my first time staying in a different area of Rome. Campo de Firoi area is loads of fun and I have to say I loved it. The market in the mornings is a must see and the restaurants and bars are always active in the evenings especially on the weekends. The area is sooo...convenient to stay in; it is an easy walk to most of Rome's must sites. The hotel and apartments are well located. Great area and loads of fun. Not to be missed!! I tried booking our stay at the hotel but it was totally booked and so I booked a 2-bedroom apartment affiliated with the hotel. We arrived into Rome late from Paris, and even though we can in late checking was smooth and friendly. The first apartment we were directed to is located directly in the square; it was not what we were expecting. It is on the fourth floor and faces the front of the building. This apartment was not that nice & OMG!! It was extremely noisy. We spent one night there and the next morning we requested to be moved. The staff at the hotel was more than accommodating, and they worked to ensure that we were comfortable and happy and they quickly came up with a solution that worked out quite well. We were more than pleased. We were moved to two, one bedroom apartment (both in the same building) off the main square and loved it. Each apartment sleeps four or more people, (great for family and a group of friends) and both have a kitchen and sitting area. The sitting room has the day beds and thus doubles as a sleeping room. One apartment was on the 4th floor and the other on the 2nd floor. Lol...I took the apt on the second floor, I would not recommend getting an apartment on the 4th floor if you are not in great shape as there are lots of steps. We enjoyed the apartments we finally ended up in, they were large and comfortable, Lol\u2026.and we had free Wi-Fi \u2013 LOVED IT!! I would stay in either of these two apartments again, but would not want and or recommend the apartment facing the square. If you are thinking of staying in an apartment, try to stay away from the one facing the square. The noise level on the weekend is very, very high, everyone is out having fun, lots of eating, drinking and just hanging out. If you are someone that goes to bed early (10:00 PM or so) you will not find it appealing. Any of the apartments on the side streets are quieter. My recommendation to the hotel since they are managing the apartments is to make them look a little warmer, friendlier more receptive. Simply by put some prettier covers on the day beds in the sitting room and add some flowers when they know that guests are booked for those rooms, it will make them more cheerful. Finally yet importantly, let me not forget to mention just how WOMDERFL the staff at the Hotel Campo De Fiori is - everyone and I mean everyone is fantastic. The service was exceptional! I can\u2019t say enough about just how good the service is at Hotel Campo De Fiori. The owner/s of this property is lucky to have such a great staff.

All of the extras were thought through - they have a superb roof terrace, but instead of trying to sell you overpiced wine in a porrly stocked mini bar, they provide a corkscrew in every room and glasses and recommend that you pick up a local bottle fromt he store over the road (we did this for 5 E) and take it to the terrace to enjoy!

We stayed here for 4 nights in end of January 2012. This visit was very special to us as this is our 15th wedding anniversary and we decided to go to rome and selected hotel campo de fiori after analyzing so much and we would like to say that the hotel lived up to the expectations and made our stay very special and quite memorable. Even before travelling we would have sent many emails asking for various questions/details as our visit was very special for us, we got the response within hours to each and every mail. \"when in Rome\": The top 3 reasons why someone should stay in Hotel campo de fiori 1. Ambience & Cleanliness The hotel is really beautiful and the rooms are absolutely clean. Rooms are small but nothing to worry about as it is very much sufficient. The rooms have all the required facilities like safe box, clean bathroom, comfortable bed and especially a wine opener in the bathroom. Quite a romantic hotel, but suitable for all age groups whether it is with family with kids, for romantic couples or even for individual travellers 2. Service One of the best service we have experienced (as we travel a lot). whether it is Airport transfer or suggestion for restaurants, or arranging for tours or providing any information about rome etc., All the staffs were very friendly and smiling always when we enter or exit, we were kept hearing \"buongiorno\" / \"buonasera\" from every staff we came across every time. For sure this hotel is \"home away from home\" 3. Location The best location.. few steps we were campo de fiori piazza, The location is very center and we could walk for 20-30 min. in all directions all the attractions were covered, saves time and also we did not use public transport. \"New Attraction in Rome\": The hotel Roof Top terrace - We relaxed ourselves during lunch and evening wine at the roof top terrace, brought pizza slices from Forna (just in the square) sat in the roof top terrace and brought a nice bottle(s) of wine (before and after dinner) and sat in the terrace in the evening(s). May be one day this will be added into the tourist attraction list as must visit in rome. \"The Terminal\" : We use the hotel fixed rate airport transfer both way, perfectly organized and we left early in the morning and when we came down to the lobby the driver was waiting for us already. \"Fast five\" : We would have met approx about 5 different people in the reception, they are extermely fast in their service whether it is check-in, check-out or any queries we got the response immediately within couple of minitues. And also they are our best friends during the stay. \"Saturday night fever\" : We are not into major nighlife, but when we stepped out of the hotel on saturday night, we felt that we should experience the same..this is the place just outside the hotel, when we needed a break in between changing bars we just jumped into the hotel lobby and relaxed and had chat with the person in the receiption and pop out again to another round of party..and when we were totally tired at around 3am no need for a cab just steped inside the hotel and crashed. what more we need...for a perfect night out.. \"eat enjoy love\" : There are few restaurant arounds which are good (1) Da Pancrazio - just opp. to the hotel (2) Al Balestrari - simple, good ambience, friendly staff, great service and very reasonably priced (3) Forno - for the best pizza (4) Baffeto 2 As Audrey hepburn says when asked, which place she liked the most \"Rome, by all means Rome\" for sure we will also cherish our visit to rome and our 15th wedding anniversary as long as we live.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLocation, Quality, Quiet, Comfort\u201d", "Author": "BrennaBee", "ReviewID": "UR123808689", "Content": "Hi, we stayed here after 2 nights somewhere else.

I had a particular liking to a type of cheese that the hotel provided for breakfast. I asked Maria the name of the cheese and she said she didn't know. The next morning, we went down to grab some breakfast as usual and she came to me with the same friendly smile and told me she brought the sticker label from the packaging to give me. It doesn't end there. Gabrielle, recommended two restaurants to try in Rome and they ended up being our favorite restaurants during our trip.

For example, one night my wife and I had dinner at a great wine bar less than 2 blocks away from the hotel and after that we decided to cross the bridge over to Trastevere for a last drink. The walk is pleasant and the distances are more than reasonable. This could be done because the location of the place we were staying really couldn't get any better. The room was really charming. The size was very adequate: it wasn't huge, but it wasn't cramped. The decoration was tasteful. Bottom line, the room was very cosy.

I telephoned the hotel and after a few minutes they phoned back to say that the car had been stuck in traffic and would be there shortly.

It is ideally situated for all the main sights but it is relatively easy to get around on foot in Rome. One of the receptionists at the hotel went to great lengths to try and sell us one of their guided tours and looked quite disgruntled when I asked him about the open top bus! I would thoroughly recommend the open top bus, it is only a short walk to the Monumente a Vittorio Emanuele 11 (wedding cake building) where all the buses seemed to stop. We were also given tickets for the green open top bus which went out to the Catacombs which was wonderful. The route takes you out into the roman countryside and the smells and sights were breathtaking. This is not something I would have normally done but I am so thankful to the very kind lady who gave us the tickets. Our room 101 was fairly small and situated on the first floor, next to the extremely small lift and overlooking the front of the hotel. This was incredibly noisy at night and I wished I had paid extra for a room at the back and on a higher floor. The room was clean enough and the bed nice and big although the shower room was really small.

Be warned: as the flats are in old buildings, the ceilings are low and furnishings are antique. The extra bed in the living area was just a regular cot, and not an extremely comfortable one, at that. The hotel itself is newer and probably much more luxurious, but those rooms were not an option for us, being 3 people. However, for a short stay this was not a huge problem for us, as the location is very central and within walking distance to almost all the major Rome sites and shopping district, along with excellent restaurants nearby. Also, the charm of the old flat outweighed the lesser level of comfort. Good points: besides the location, the hotel staff is excellent, friendly and always helpful, I can't say enough nice things about them. The breakfast was plentiful and tasty, with good coffee & service. Also, the flat was immaculately cleaned and made up each day. Points which need improving: Being November, the flat was cold and the only working source of heat was an A/C in the living room. This was fine for anyone sleeping in the living room's cot, however the main bedroom was always cold. The only English channel on the TV was MTV...! Also, the cot in our flat had a noticeable sag in the middle and the hot water service was intermittent in the shower. Our main source of discomfort, however, was during our first night (a Saturday) in the flat, which overlooked the main square. There are several bars and restaurants all over the Campo de Fiori square, and the noise from people in the square during this night was so loud (despite the double-glazed windows) that we couldn't sleep until nearly the middle of the night. To be fair, this was only the case for the Saturday night of our stay. Therefore, I would definitely recommend a room not facing the square, if possible, for one's stay.

I decided to contribute one more brief review based on my most recent stay at the beginning of November (2011) for five nights. Everything remains as I write in my original review - all wonderful but I just wanted to add that, in addition to the many appealing features of this little beauty, I was more struck than even before regarding the staff here. I have been in many hotels, not only in Italy or elsewhere, where the staff is perfunctory, answering questions when asked, being polite enough, etc. But, as someone who chooses to usually travel solo to Italy, I was even more appreciative of this hotel's very special staff members than even during past visits. Especially when solo, it is nice to come back at the end of the day and be greeted warmly and asked about your day. It is not something I need, but found it very welcoming. I don't like to intrude on staff unless I need something as I know they are working but it is very nice to have that warm brief schmooze, for lack of a better word. I usually pop in and out of this hotel a number of times a day - sometimes up to 4 or 5 times a day and evening (and, that is why their perfect location is so perfect) and it felt almost like I was at home, coming back and being greeted like an old friend. Even teased a few times, which really made me feel at home. They were also very welcoming when friends of mine came by to meet up with me. Many hotels aren't all that friendly to non-guests. But, my had stayed at this hotel a few years ago (they couldn't get a room this time) and were keen to stop by and that was fine. I also had some other friends meet and spend a few minutes in the front of the hotel where they have seats. These are friends who frequently visit Rome and stay in another hotel all the time. They fell in love with this marvel of a hotel and said that next visit, they will stay here. (I did keep the friend visits to a minimum not to take advantage but I appreciated they did not mind.) I like sharing the goodness that this hotel is though I fear that means the more of us previous guests that do, the harder it will be to get rooms but, I happily will take that risk to encourage travelers - and maybe even particularly a special word to solo travelers - that this place does not seduce you just once or twice, it maintains its charms and stellar service with each subsequent visit.

This time I have to. We chose Hotel Campo De' Fiori based on the Trip Advisor ratings and its geography: we were visiting my son and he was staying close by. I was concerned with what I had read about Italian room sizes, out-of-date and/or unsanitary bathrooms, \u201cfree\u201d breakfasts that were nothing more than bread and expresso, etc. Hotel Campo De' Fiori did not subject us to any of that. What we did get was a hotel and room with dark thick highly polished wood trim and doors throughout (the wooden door on our room was 3 1/2\u201d thick), a gleaming black tile and chrome bathroom, a shower with an overhead \u201crain\u201d nozzle and a hand wand, free high speed internet, a daily free breakfast in a caf\u00e9 style room that included a wonderful variety of sweet rolls, cakes, and crescents, eggs, sausages, salamis, cheeses, espresso, cappuccino, juices, etc., and a roof garden with views of the National Monument of Victor Emmanuel II, the Pantheon and St. Peter\u2019s. The staff was as impressive as the facility: always smiling and asking to help (in impeccable English), they found and recommended restaurants for every taste and occasion (including searching for and finding one for our family\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner (with turkey), they helped us coordinate with our son, arranged for taxies, and they jumped in and took charge when a US credit card company (not the one we using to pay our bill) sent a warning about using the card overseas and demanded an immediate overseas call. The maid service and the young lady who brought us Cappuccino daily at breakfast were equally attentive and charming. I confess that the room was smaller than we are used to in the US. It was however, nicely decorated and big enough for the bed, a desk and chair, an armoire (including a safe and a standard hotel size refrigerator (which was standard \u2013 no request needed). We had no complaints about the room size. The hotel is on 50' from the edge of Piazza Campo De' Fiori, on a cobblestoned alley perhaps 20 feet (4-5 meters?) wide between the Piazza and the Corso Vittorio Emanuele II. The Piazza has many restaurants and a daily open market of foods, trinkets and clothing. From there my wife and I \u2013 in our fifties and in less than perfect health \u2013 walked to the Pantheon, St. Peter\u2019s and the Piazza Navona. The Colosseum, the National Monument of Victor Emmanuel II, the Roman Forum, the Trevi Fountain, and the Spanish Steps are all within walking distance for younger guests. Lest I be accused of being too easy to please \u2013 I am known as a bit of curmudgeon, and did have objections to some encounters with tradesmen, gypsies at the Vatican, and taxi drivers during our visit. I agree with the writer who says that it had no iron available, no laundry service, and no toaster in the breakfast room. But we did not care or notice - the Hotel Campo De' Fiori is a boutique hotel with perhaps 20 rooms, and we did not plan to do laundry or cook toast when offered all that WAS available (my son uses a nearby coin operated laundry and dry cleaner). The Hotel Campo De' Fiori did not disappoint, and in fact exceeded my expectations daily.

I had emailed the hotel while visiting England the week before our arrival in Rome, and asked if we could store a large piece of our luggage while we toured several other towns in Italy before arriving back in Rome for the last few days of our trip. We utilized their privately arranged driver (which I would highly recommend...much nicer than waiting for a taxi). He picked us up at Rome's Fiumicino Airport on our arrival to Italy, drove us to Hotel Campo De' Fiori to drop off the luggage we wanted to store, then took us to the main train station in Rome to catch a train for Florence. It was so helpful that they would store this for us, as it saved lugging an extra unneeded suitcase thoughout Italy on the trains. When we arrived back in Rome, we were warmly welcomed and shown to our room, given maps and information about dining, directions...everything we needed. The restaurant suggestions they gave were perfect! The views from their rooftop deck are breathtaking. We went up to it each night to enjoy a glass of wine and the perfect weather and views.

However, I would add to my review that I found the room that we chose to stay in, the top floor room with Private Balcony, to be less than worth the value that was paid. The room is quite small as observed by other reviewers and the balcony, although providing a view of the Vatican, is not worthwhile considering the beauty of the rooftop deck that is available to you. As well, being so closely located to the rooftop deck, there is noise at all hours from people going in and out, which made our stay in this room less than perfect. One other note was that sometimes, even on vacation, you may wish to just stay in and watch TV in your room; the lack of English language TV available to those of us that do not speak Italian made this not possible. There are only two English language channels offered at this hotel; CNN and BBC. They do offer movies on demand but charge a rather steep 8 euros for the privilege.

I found this gem of a hotel when I was helping a friend find a place for her stay in May 2011. Unfortunately, it was booked as they only have 23 rooms . The roof terrace pulled me in from the opening of the website. In reality it will take your breath away - the views are spectacular!!!!!!!!!!!! And the prefect place to end a day with a bottle of wine and all Italian delicacies. Or to live \"dolce fa niente\" ( the sweet of doing nothing ) any time of day. But I have to rewind to explain. Because the hotel was booked, I found a flat for 2 of my friends across the the way from the hotel in Piazza Biscione in May 2011 . While they were there, ,they needed a cork screw and ran across the hotel to borrow one, as there was none in the flat. There they befriended Matteo at the hotel's front desk. Suffice to say, he and the staff at the hotel were life savers for my two friends. And they were invited to the roof terrace where the panoramic view Roma will take your breath away. My friends told Matteao that I would be coming to Rome in Sept 2011 and that she hoped he would allow me up as well. I rented a flat myself, ( not connected to this hotel ) just on the other side of the Piazza Campo dei Fiori and so the night I arrived I wanted to see Roma by rooftop so I took myself and a foto of my friends and went to the hotel. I was lucky to find Matteo and Andrea behind the desk, and asked if we could visit the roof top terrace. From the moment we walked in we were warmly welcomed. They showed us around and gave us some history on the building. To see Rome at night from a Roman rooftop, you have to live it to know what it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then the next day we met Valentina - a sweetheart and one of those gorgeous Italian young women, and several other staff members throughout the week. All just a joy to know. The entire staff made our stay in Roma that much more the better for all the help they gave us as we passed by every morning to say hello before we started on our way. And any guest who happened to be checking out while we were there, had nothing but accolades for this gem of a hidden treasure and all the staff who work there. For myself and the person I traveled with, we were treated just as if we were guests of the hotel or their flats. Suffice to say, if you plan on a visit to Rome, want to be in a great hotel, with great people, in a great location in the center of town, then book this place as fast as you can and go and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also note, they have flats ( dependencies ) apartments for rent as well, all over the Piazza Campo de Fiori- so ask about that as well . On a scale of 1-10, this place gets a 50!

The piazza was filled with a marketplace which disappeared at night as the restaurants, bars, gelato shops, and bakeries came to life! We thought it would be a noisy place to stay with so much going on outside our window at night, but it was not! The shutters provided plenty of noise elimination. The staff was excellent and I would definitely stay here again. Next time, I'd like to bring my husband, because this is a romantic hotel as well!

The hotels location was perfect for using as a base for exploring all the sights of the Eternal City! 5 steps from Campo De\u2019 Fiori and 5 mins from Piazza Navona, perfect for walking through the city during the days, and even better for that evening \u2018La Passeggiata\u2019 stroll. We never once opted for taxi\u2019s or public transport while in Rome as the location of the hotel was central to everything, and a comfortable 15-20min walk to Vatican City, Coliseum, Spanish Steps. Etc. The hotel is beautifully decorated in vintage Italian period styling, with lovely communal waiting rooms, with the basement library also functioning as the dining room where they serve breakfast. The bedroom was comfortable and as spacious as other hotel rooms we\u2019d experienced in Italy. The hotel also had a wonderful rooftop patio, which was perfect for enjoying a relaxing glass of wine before heading out for dinner, and afterwards to absorb the picturesque scene of Rome\u2019s rooftops and cathedral domes at nightfall. Added Bonus: The hotel also has a luggage storage area, which was perfect as we travelled to the Amalfi Coast for 3 days, before returning to Rome and the Hotel Campo De\u2019 Fiori. Having this amenity was such a benefit as it meant that we didn\u2019t have to worry about the hassle (or expense) of dropping our bags off at Termini Station. Overall, our stay at the Hotel Campo De\u2019 Fiori was perfect, and just what was needed to make the most of our visit to Rome. The room rate was slightly higher than other hotels we reviewed, however the location of the hotel to all the historic sights, and the plethora of wonderful restaurants on Campo De; Fiori and Piazza Navona more than made up for this. (There was no need for us to pay for taxi\u2019s or waste time on public transport, as we were living in the heart of the city.)

Position: right in the centre of Rome, so all the well known \"sights\" are within walking distance, which we consider to be a plus, because there is no better way to see a city than on foot. The hotel borders a busy piazza, edged with restaurants, with a market in the middle, so lots going on. Hotel: small & privately owned, which we prefer, as you tend to get a better service. The hotel website indicates that all the bedrooms are individually furnished; judging by the photos on the website, all are done in a similar baroque style, as are the public rooms; we found that quite stylish & a change from the usual bland hotel style. An earlier reviewer didn't like the furnishings, but such things are all a matter of personal taste & the photos on the website do giver a pretty good indication of what the rooms are like. The bedroom was big enough,had a good-sized comfortable bed & good air-con. The bathroom was smallish but what I expected for a city-centre hotel & was nicely fitted,with a good shower. We had no problems @ all with noise from the square. We liked the basement breakfast room - no windows, as another reviewer said, but lots of furnishings to look at! It's a buffet breakfast & the choice is excellent. Rooftop: incredible! You get the most amazing views right acroos the city, in all directions. It was a joy to sit-up there every evening, glass of wine in hand, before going off to eat. As to the hotel being unlicensed, so that you have to provide your own drink, there are shops in the square where you can buy what you want, a fridge in the bedroom for icecubes & chilling, so what could be easler, not to mention cheaper? Lots of people got \"nibbles\", like olives, to take up to have with their drinks. Sit, relax, unwind after a hard day's sight-seeing; look @ the stunning views & listen to the church bells - unbeatable! Incidentally, we didn't have any problem with the lift - yes it is small but it's quite fast & we never waited that long (it is only a small hotel, so doesn't have that many rooms/people staying there) & there of course stairs! Yes it does only go to floor 5, so I can see that if your bedroom is on floor 6 then lugging a suitcase from floor 5 to floor 6, by the stairs, would be an aggravation. We didn't have to do that & walking up from floor 5 to floor 6 to get to the roof terrace wasn't a problem (even carrying a wine bottle & glasses!). Service: Couldn't fault. All the reception staff were friendly & very helpful. They gave us clear directions to get to places. We did ask for suggestions for restaurants & were very happy with the 3 places we went to as a result. The lady who gets your tea/coffee/whatever for you @ breakfast is friendly & pleasant. And the \"unsung heroes\" - ie those who quietly & efficiently clean & tidy your bedroom whilst you are swanning round Rome - did an excellent job. Finally, we used the hotel-arranged taxi transfer both from & to the airport; on time, no problems @ all. Not the cheapest hotel, but we wanted a small hotel, with a bit of luxury, in a central position, and this certainly fitted the bill.

The rooms are beautiful - unfortunately, they did not have our first choice of room for the entire duration of the stay, so we had to move after 3 nights to another room. They did move our luggage and made the experience as smooth a possible, so the only nuisance was to re-pack our suitcases halfway through the stay. Both rooms were unique, very tasteful and rather baroque, which we did enjoy. The first room was on the top floor and a tad smaller but did have our own private balcony,which we did really enjoy! Bathrooms are tiny - pretty standard in central Rome. We had absolutely no problems with noise and the rooms were well air conditioned (a tad too cold for my taste, but perfect for my American husband. Breakfast is served in the basement and pretty standard fare. The server at breakfast was very nice and happy to accommodate my husbands 'two cappuccinos' routine; she was actually the only one in the hotel who was not very fluent in English (not a problem for us since I am Italian) and despite this, I noticed she was going out of her way to help other English-speaking couples (including one with a 'to go' order of coffee). Service from the front desk was excellent, very helpful to book tickets, give directions and promptly book taxis. We did not ask for any restaurant recommendation since we are quite familiar with the city.

The room was not huge, but decent size with more than enough room and very nicely furnished. The contemporary bathroom was great. The hotel has a really wonderful roof deck with views in every direction. It was great to be able to read a book, enjoy the sunshine and a glass of wine and look out over Rome. Breakfast is in a charming breakfast room. The selection was very good and everything was well prepared. There had been a problem (beyond the control of the hotel) when we arrived.

It proved to be an excellent choice. To put the review in context, please know that I am one of those travelers who values architecture, design, and a special sense of place more than a mini fridge and closet space. Location: I've stayed in three different Rome hotels, including one 5-star, and this is by far the best. The location is hard to beat. Not only is it close to the historic sites and monuments you want to see (Pantheon, Forum, Trevi, etc.) but it's adjacent to the \"real\" Rome--the neighborhoods where the restaurants, shops, and streets bustle with Italians and not everyone is clutching a guidebook. The service: The concierges, especially Daniella, were incredibly helpful, setting up everything from a private tour (tip: Do NOT try to get into the Colosseum or Vatican without a private guide--you'll spend your entire vacation waiting on line) to airport transfers and dinner reservations, all of which were great. Our favorite restaurant in Rome, by the way, is nearby Riccioli Cafe (Via delle Coppelle 13). The atmosphere is relaxed, the prices are modest, but the wine list comes in two volumes and the food is impressive, even to this New Yorker. The hotel: The hotel itself is very charming although we crammed my tall, 12 year-old daughter into our room and it made for tight quarters. We stayed in the main hotel and not the apartments because I'd rather be cramped than give up an ounce of charm. The bathroom had a shower, no tub, but was attractive and sleekly modern. The room itself was charming and the beds were comfortable. If you've stayed in Rome before, you know that's a rarity! If we had been traveling as a couple, l would have tried to get one of the more romantic rooms on the top floor but otherwise, I have no complaints. We experienced none of the problems with the cleaning service that other reviewers reported. Other notes: The rooftop terrace is indeed very special although during our stay, it was strictly BYOB and snacks. From reading the other reviews, I had got the impression that the hotel serves snacks and drinks up there. The buffet breakfast consisted of fruit, cheeses, meats, cereals, yogurt, pastries, breads and rolls with an attendant serving hot beverages. The cappuccino was delicious but the juices tasted oddly artificial and sugary.

We thought the hotel was almost ideally located, very close to all the sites and some interesting restaurants nearby. Pros: 1. Service: The employees at the hotel were flawless. Everything we asked for was taken care of, and they are genuinely nice people. 2. The room was neat and cleaned well each day. Also, it had good sound proofing from the nearby street, which can become noisy at night (especially near the weekend). 3. Breakfast: In a really beautiful room downstairs they serve breakfast. It isn't a complicated affair, but decent enough in selection. 4. Complimentary wi-fi. I really think this is now a must for travel. Being able to stay connected is so useful, and make planning your daily trip a lot easier. Cons: 1. The room we stayed in was small. My guess is that this is pretty much par for the course in any great city on the continent. 2. The decoration in the room is nicely done, but was not to our taste. It seemed somewhat dark. Although, to be honest, we didn't spend a lot of time here. 3. Don't take the guided tour! It is not worth it! I will go into this last one in more detail. We took a 3 hour private guided tour of the Vatican Museum arranged by the hotel and it cost us around $240 USD (2 people). The guide was competent, but she overcharged by $20 USD (which the hotel helped us get refunded). For what the guide offered, I thought the tour was unexceptional. You are better off getting into a tour group, you learn all the same things. I think the cost is the same for 4 people, so in that case the private tour only costs about 2X per person compared to a group price. 4. The market next door seems like a great idea, but it really is not that great. The prices are high and selection in limited. Two final recommendations. Try the pizza in the bakery in the back corner of the Campo de Fiori. Everything there is quite good. Also make a right out of the hotel, and travel across the plaza. As you go down one more street, you will see a small wine bar on the left.

We would recommend this as the most stress free way to get from the airport to the Hotel. Well worth the 50 Euros. On arrival at the hotel reception, we were greeted by very friendly staff and checked in quickly and efficiently. We were given a map and initial directions to all the local sites. We had booked a deluxe double. Although this was not the largest room that we have ever stayed in, it was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated and furnished. Similarly, the shower room, whilst small was immaculate and ornate. To our delight we were at the back of the hotel and found the room to be very quiet, despite our proximity to Campo De' Fiori. The room had a very small balcony, which we never used, except for drying the occasional item of clothing. Breakfast was another pleasant surprise and surpassed our expectations of a 'continental breakfast'. The breakfast room was a converted cellar and was beautifully presented - the choice were good and the quality equally so - the service at breakfast was also always excellent.

The location is perfect - 20 mins walk (in different directions) to all the main attractions- situated on a narrow cobbled street, covered in ivy on the outside, the Hotel Campo di ' Fiori has charm and a warm welcoming feel to it. The hotel is traditionally decorated and the rooms quite oppulant - yes the rooms are on the small side, but this is a 'small' hotel, and I think you will find the size typical of hotel rooms in cities around Europe. I would suggest booking a superior room to get a little more space. We stayed in room 501 - it was lovely (decorated in green and gold) with 2 floor to ceiling windows with shutters opening out looking across at a tiny square. The Campo di'Fiori which is situated right around the corner from the hotel, has a great market during the day, in the evening it is the 'happening' place with the 'young' and particularly in the weekend, it can get quite rowdy, however the double windows blocked out any noise. The roof top terrace is fabulous, and well used. With a number of separate areas where you can take your bottle of wine and watch the sunset in the evening, relax and read a book during the day, or just sit and 'chill' and take it all in. From here across the rooftops you can see the dome of St Peters, the dome of the Pantheon and many church bells dotted around - and the striking stark white Vittoria Emanuelle II monument in the distance. There is a wonderful traditional deli on a corner of the Campo that sells wine, and good quality deli items, cheeses and cold meats, etc. The basement breakfast room is lovely, and they provide a very good breakfast. I read comments from others not happy with the breakfast selection - we stayed in 7 different hotels during our trip, and this was definitely one of the best we had. There was lovely fresh fruit salad each day, and a 'hot dish' usually scrambled egg, plus all the usual breakfast offerings, cereal, yoghurt pastries, cold meats, cheeses etc. and great Cappuccinos. The hotels staff were excellent and so helpful. Gabrielle and Barbara left a lasting impression, they were so friendly and helpful. Barbara helped us make some further travel arrangements and their recommendations for restaurants were really good. Gabrielle gave us the name of a restaurant where his parents go to, for our next stop Siena, we had the best meal of our trip (went back twice). There are alot of negative comments about the apartments - they are not decorated the same as the hotel , but are appointed in a fashion that a family can stay and cook for themselves and have some extra room that a hotel room would not be able to offer them - in a hotel you would have to pay for 2 rooms to accommodate more than 3 people. They are basic, but clean - and typical of living in an apartment in the middle of a big city. I think people expect they are going to an apartment building - but they are separate apartments doted around in buildings close to the hotel, most off the Campo itself. You have to look at the apartments as completely separate to the hotel altogether. Anyway, this is a review of the hotel not the apartments. But we did take a look at the apartments for future reference.

We stayed in one of the apartments on the front end of our cruise which are located about two blocks from the main hotel building. The room was spacious, well equipped and a very nice modern bathroom. It was not what I would call overly elegant. A couple of drawbacks....we were on the fourth floor with no elevator access although hotel staff gladly carried our five suitcases up four flights of stairs. Secondly, we found the noise level from outside to be a minor distraction. Although the apartments are removed from the main hotel we found them to be very secure and felt very safe. On the back end of our cruise we stayed in the main hotel and found our room to be much smaller than the apartment but very luxurious, modern and a very nice modern bathroom. The main hotel has elevator access and beautiful rooftop terraces. Our room in the main hotel was on the fifth floor and was a deluxe king. The cost was 15 euros more than the apartment and we personally found the room in the main hotel to be much better for us. Besides a great location the best thing this hotel has going for it has a very friendly and accomodationg staff. We booked private tours through them prior to leaving home. They arranged a tour of the Vatican as well as the Colesseum/Roman Forum. The guides were both extremely knowledgeable. I always found the staff quick to respond to my emails.

It thoroughly deserves it's high-ranking here on tripadvisor and is definately somewhere I will come back to one day. The photo's on the hotel's website are a fair representation of the faciltiies which is reassuring amongst the hustle and bustle of 100's of city-centre hotels vying for your money. Location-wise it is perfect, set in the Centro Storico area of the city set on one corner of the Campo de'Fiori square, a market by day and a lively area of bars and restaurants by night. Mainly in a pedestrian area but take care to look out for the odd taxi, van or lorry that deliver people and goods to the square and rattle over the cobbled streets around the hotel and square. It looks amazing from the outside, covered in ivy and standing out from the faded decor that is typical of many Roman buildings. The staff are amazingly helpful, we arrived (using the hotel's private transfer from the airport which I highly recommend as a very easy and convenient way to get from the airport to the hotel front door and not much more expensive than a taxi) just before miday and the room we had booked was already available which is very unusual for city centre hotels and very welcome after an early start to get to Rome. Full of local information they provided us with not only a local map but a walking tour marked out to ensure we were able to take in all the sights. We didn't use any of the local guide services they offered but they seemed to be comprehensive and from reading other reviews appear to be good value for money. The (deluxe double) room we stayed in was excellent. A good size for a European city-centre hotel it was very tastefully decorated, had a large double bed, very large wardrobes, ample storage for clothes, flat-screen TV (which we didn't turn on) and an obligatory safe. Other reviews have mentioned the fridge, wine glasses and corkscrew which are extremely useful for a bottle of wine on the terrace at sunset. The bathroom was fabulously decorated and had a great walk-in shower with an outstanding rain-shower head. Our room faced a small interior courtyard which made it very peaceful but the streets outside are no noiser than any other city-centre and those that have complained about the noise in these reviews are making a fuss over nothing. Breakfast is good and served by a very cheerful and helpful lady who appears to be managing the service on her own very efficiently and expertly, a shining example of how good the hotel staff really are. Don't miss the 3-level rooftop terrace, mentioned elsewhere but definately worth taking a bottle of wine up to to watch the sun-set and take in the sights and sounds of this wonderful city. I mentioned location but it really is fantastic. You can walk everywhere, the Colosseum is around 20-30mins walk (get there early to avoid the long queues or haggle on price with one of the guides touting for business outside the entrance), and then you can strol back up Palatine Hill and through the Roman Forum. The Vatican City is around the same distance as the Colsseum in the opposite direction (also good to get there early and go straight to the museums for the Sistine Chapel and the amazing Last Judgement). The Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps are all within 30 minutes of gentle walking. Just over the river and around 15 minutes away is the Trastevere area full of very good restaurants and ideal for dinner.

It did not let us down. the location was unbelievable, right in the heart of Campo de' Fiori. A bustling Piazza was right outside the hotel. There was a market setup each day in the piazza and plenty of food choices as well as meat and pastry shops not to mention plenty of clothing shops. the Hotel was a short walk to the Pantheon and the Colosseum. The room we had came with a private balcony, but since we were on the 6th floor our room was right outside of the hotel's 3 level terrace. This became our terrace to relax with a bottle of wine and some fresh meats and cheeses from the shops below, so the additional cost for our room was really not needed. The room we had was a little larger than the one my sister and brother in law had. Both were small compared to USA rooms but about what you would expect to find in any city hotel. The rooms were decorated very tastefully and were extremely clean. The bathrooms, always of concern, were new and very clean with all of the modern appointments. One word of caution do not get a room overlooking the piazza, unless you are into a very active and loud nightlife and want to hear that late into the evening. One of the rooms we had was over the piazza, and the noise level was quite high late in the evening. Our room was overlooking the rooftops of other hotels and apartments and was extremely quiet. From our terrace we could see the domes of St Peters and the Pantheon, truly amazing. The entire staff at the hotel was extremely courteous and helpful in anything and everything we wanted.

The rooms are each like jewel boxes; individually decorated, different colors of paint (walls), furnishings and paintings together with beautiful lighting fixtures and, a real plus: carpeting. The carpeting eliminates any noise at all from other rooms, which is a big plus. And, though the campo can get noisy at night, you simply close the double paned windows and silence envelopes the room and sleep is easy. The beds are extremely comfortable (not easy to come by in Rome), towels are large and plush and I particularly like that they have the system whereby you insert your room \"key\" into a corresponding slot when you enter the room that activates the electricity which reduces energy waste. The rooms all have a small refrigerator, glasses, wine opener and plenty of space for clothing - it is not like other hotel rooms where you are crammed into it and bumping into inadequate closet space. The wardrobes, drawers, cabinets are made of a beautiful wood and provide more than enough space and, in the rooms I stayed in this area is separate from the space with the bed, etc., making it even more comfortable. The bathrooms are nicely decorated with ample space and rainshower showerheads. I did not have a bath, only a shower (but a nice size); not sure if other rooms do have baths. The photos on their website are representative of the rooms, lobby, breakfast space and roof and I think the photos are fairly recent; at least I recall them being different than ones I'd seen on the site in the past. Yet, I find the rooms to be even prettier than in the website's photos. I have stayed in both the double standard room and the double deluxe room and have found both to be designed in a way that you have more space than you might originally think. I did not feel confined at all in the rooms even though I was there for a week at a time. Breakfast is typical and plentiful (eggs, cakes, breads, fruit, yogurt, croissants, meats, cheeses, juices, cereal) and the woman who serves is always pleasant as she manages to effectively serve a room full of guests. The roof deck is the crown jewel of the hotel - three levels which include comfortable, cushioned couches and chairs and tables which allows for people to relax and bring up wine and food and soak up the unobstructed gorgeous view of Rome. Tip: it's nice to take your breakfast up to the roof. The staff is a stand out: each of them from Valentina, Matteo, Adam, Barbara and a new fellow that I unfortunately cannot recall his name but each are personable, engaging and helpful. They offer excellent suggestions about restaurants, getting around, and will cheerfully assist you with reservations, etc. I feel as though I have a home in Rome when I stay at this hotel and wouldn't stay anywhere else. I'm already plotting my return.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLove the Apartment M2\u201d", "Author": "BellaOne", "ReviewID": "UR102940443", "Content": "We've just returned form our vacation to Italy. We stayed 4 total nights at M2 Dependance (Apartment) on the Hotel Campo De'Fiori and loved it. The hotel itself is really charming and roof top garden is an amazing place. M2 is around the corner on the piazza, and I loved being there. It is large and was great for our family of 4. The hotel staff is very helpful and friendly. They let us check in early and communicate by email very well! The square has a market every day that clears out in the late afternoon to become an open public space with basically no cars. Forno bakery sells excellent pastries and pizza to go. The Magnolia was a great sit down place and there are several great \"bars\" to hang out and get a beer or wine for a great price without paying for a table. Our 2.5 yr old could run around the square with the other kids and was welcome wherever we went. The M2 is kind of a shotgun set up, one room wide with one enclosed outdoor patio (READ - no view of anything but straight up! But was nice to sit out there). The bathroom is large with a standup, enclosed shower, good lighting, and plenty of shelf and counter space. Queen bed in the large room at the back of the apartment is nice. Nice TV and overall quiet. 2 single beds in the front room are definitely for kids but were still comfortable. The room has a bit more noise but still nothing I would complain of. There is no \"living room\". The rest of the apartment is a small kitchen and a nice table/chairs. The only TV is in the large bedroom, if this makes a difference to you. I was a little disappointed at first that the apartment had no living area, but it really never mattered. We watched no TV and were gone all the time or sitting on the patio. I have previously stayed in other parts of Rome and would only come back to Campo De'Fiori in the future. It is so well located and feels like you have your own slice of Rome to youself...surrounded by people who are really living and working in the area. I have read a lot about noise, drinking, or whatever on the piazza. We didn't find any of that except for very late on a Saturday night. And it was really just more crowded than anything.

I usually seek cool and contemporary where possible but this time - at the suggestion of my wife - we wanted something that fitted more with the character of old Rome.

The hotel had free WiFi - something all hotels should have in 2011 (get more than one access code if you have more than one device) - and it had a lovely roof terrace with views over the city.

I decided to stay at the Hotel Campo De'Fiori because of the reviews on TripAdvisor, because they had apartments, and because of the central location. After staying at an apartment maintained by Hotel Campo De'Fiori, I needed to write a review to give other families with young children more information. Pluses: We found the apartment to be spacious and clean. The apartment was near the square/market, and thus was convenient for us. Great view from the rooftop. Minuses: The staff of the hotel was often aloof and unhelpful to us. For example, I booked online for a specific apartment that was on a ground floor so that we wouldn't have to take our stroller and multiple bags up and down many flights of steps. When we arrived, they did not give me the apartment that they told me I would get via email - all that was available was on the 2nd or 3rd floors, at a building 2 blocks from the hotel. We had to move 4 heavy suitcases, a young child, stroller and car seat over two blocks and up to a 3rd floor apartment at 8 pm in the evening. Since this is a small hotel and there was only one employee working at night, we had to do this all ourselves. When we left for the airport several days later, early in the morning, we had to do the same thing in reverse. Also, the cleaning staff regularly moved things around the apartment, and I needed to be alert to where my belongings were. Although there is free wi-fi at the hotel, we did not have it at the apartment. Lastly, do not book transportation to/from the airport through the hotel. We used Rome Cabs to go to the hotel - they were great - they waited for us at the airport and they charged 55 euros for the 4 of us. On the way back, we used the transportation service arranged through the hotel. The price they quoted was 80 euros, and then when we arrived at the airport, the driver told us it was really 90 euros because he had to wait for us at the hotel. This service is obviously gouging riders, and I would not recommend them at all.

We were given an apartment across the road from the hotel which I must say was a nice surprise. Spacious bedroom, sitting room, fully fitted kitchen and a comfortable bathroom. The hotel is located at one corner of Campo De Fiori Square which has a nice market each day. We were very lucky with our hotel selection as in terms of location we could not have picked a better spot, very close to all the beautiful sights of Rome and about two hundred yards from the hop on hop off tour bus stops. We did not see a lot of the hotel as we wanted to take in as much of Rome as we could during our short stay. We did look at the roof top terrace and our plan was to return some evening with a bottle of wine and some cheese however we would have needed to stay for a couple of more nights. Considering the fact that we spent so little time in the hotel it is amazing how we managed to get to know the staff at reception. I was in touch with Barbara & Valentina a few days before we arrived in Rome and they gave some programme suggestions that we should take on board during our stay. The Borghese Gallery was one such suggestion, the place had to been booked in advance and Valentina very kindly had that reservation made for us on our arrival. While we had an early start in the morning (suffering from the effects of a lot of wine and a big meal the night before) I would certainly recommend that you visit this gallery. Each morning we called to reception with our many questions for the day and everyone at reception just went that extra yard to be helpful, right down to recommending restaurants and making reservations for us. If there was a negative it would be that the place was a busy spot in the evenings particularly the Saturday night, so if you are planning on early nights ask for a quiet room. Having said that, for most of our stay we did sleep fairly well.

Once we were there though we were very happy with the apartment. The rooms were nicely decorated; a large bedroom and a large separate reading room which could be converted to another bedroom I think quite easily, a kitchen, modern bathroom. Lots of space. There was some street noise, church bells, all very typical of Rome. We could've closed the windows as they are all new and appear to be sound proof, but we liked the fresh air. There was a giant piece of a pillar in the bedroom which had been build around. I understand it was a pillar from the old Pompeii Theatre. The accommodation was fun for us. As friends we can now recall the time when we had our own apartment in Rome (LOL). While at the apartment you can still use the facilities of the hotel. We did not have breakfast included and saved some $$ that way, opting for breakfast in the square. The rooftop terrace is a lovely spot to watch the sunset or to comfortably lounge. The views are wonderful. Lastly, the staff at the hotel are all helpful and go the extra distance to make sure you have everything you need for a great visit. Valentina, Barbara, Matteo, Guido, Adam and the new guy (trainee). Their pride in service is evident.

The front desk staff was very helpful and gave us detailed directions to anywhere we wanted to go. We really only had one very small, minor criticism. We had a very early morning reservation at the vatican and wanted to grab breakfast first. It began at 7:30, but we were leaving at 7:15 to walk to the Vatican. The front desk had suggested going down a bit early and they would still give us a coffee and danish. However, when we did, the woman setting the area was a little rude and wouldn't serve us. She just told us we were too early. It wasn't a huge deal, but we never did get to try the breakfast the hotel offers due to our schedule.

There are a lot of things to do in this neighborhood, but I would also recommend taking the short walk over to Trestavere. The only negative experience we had was NOT the fault of this hotel. We made ATM withdrawls at 2 locations during our stay. One was in Piazza Navona (a 10 minute walk from the hotel) and the other around the corner from the hotel on Corso Vittorio Emmanuel. One of the machines must have been fitted with a \"skimming\" device and camera. We returned home to find that thousands of dollars had been stolen from us.

The room is well maintained with large comfy bed and the fridge was most appreciated being able to chill our stock of drinks! The free champagne we received from our package also went down well. The hotel is a boutique hotel so it's not large but it is immaculately kept plus the staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooftop terrace affords great views and is a great place to relax and have a few drinks with other guests, as we did each night. The breakfast room is in the basement and is very nice. It's a continental breakfast, so no sausages or eggs but it is one of the best one I have seen in Europe (Banks Mansions in Amsterdam do eggs so they win!) There is plenty of meat bread etc and a lot tastier than the cardboard breakfasts of France. The hotel location is perfect for walking to all the sights, no more than 20 minutes from the Vatican and Colisseum. We queued for almost 1 hour in high temperatures to get into the Vatican museum (well worth it) and when we left at about 12.10 you could have walked straight in! Similarly when we went to the Colisseum we were 'advised' by the guides outside that it was over 1 hour wait to get in but for 25 euro extra each we could jump the queue and get a guided tour, this was down to 8 euro each as we entered the queue and then 4,5 euro halfway along! We actually waited only 20 minutes and all in the shade. We took in the 3D Rewind Rome experience in a street behind the Colisseum (Camp de Africa or something)it was good fun and you can get a chance to dress up as a Gladiator or Senator, they dont charge you for this part and use your own camera. The receptionist recommended a rooftop meal at The Grand Hotel Minerva next to the Pantheon, its a 5 star hotel so not cheap, the food was excellent and the service was second to none and we were pleased with the recomendation, we also ate at theTucci restaurant in Piazza Navona and again enjoyed a very good meal with service to match, it was enjoyable watching the street buskers in action. In all we thought and also after speaking with other guests, you cannot really go wrong wherever you choose. One thing I would point out is the scandalous excjhange rates given out at exchange booths, the ATMs had ran out of money on the Sunday and had not refilled by Monday so I was forced to use the exchange place at the Pantheon where I was ripped off by 20% commission!! 87cents to the pound is absolute theft! When ATMs did work I received 1.21 Euro for my pound so beware of these rogues. We enjoyed our stay we had glorious weather, saw a beautiful city and topped it all by sunbathing (with a cheeky wee wine or two of course) on the rooftop terrace to wind down after lots and lots of walking.

We managed to cover alot of ground just by walking around near our hotel and saw some interesting and beautiful churches. The rooms were delightful and tastefully decorated. They were both unique in arrangement and decor, which was refreshing. (we separated into two rooms, seeing as how there were only two allowed per room). The bathroom provided adequate room with a spacious sink and shower. Even though I have to admit the room was somewhat cramped, it was still comfortable and not really a bother. We had two large suitcases with us. There is a TV, but be warned, there is only one or two English channels at the most. One of them was a news channel, which repeated the same news two or three nights in a row, which was hilarious in our opinion. The bed itself was large and very comfy. We had a view of the street directly in front of the hotel, which was nice. However, there is a club and bar located very near to the hotel (almost right across the street), and at first, it was a big nuisance. But we eventually became used to it after a couple of nights. The breakfast was excellent and had a wide array of pastries, croissants, and meats. We always were the first ones down there (its located in the basement), and it was nice having the room to ourselves :) There was always a waitress to greet us and ask us if we wanted any coffee, cappucino, etc. There is no charge for it, although make sure you know your room number (she will ask). The only complaint I had was the music selection during breakfast. It was a bunch of techno and syncopation that really was out-of-place and tacky. We thought it more funny than anything else, however. The front-desk staff are as friendly as can be. They made reservations, called taxis, and recommended restaurants for us. On the first night, we were recommended to this restaurant that was supposed to be one of the best. I don't know if they were commissioned to tell us to go there, but honestly, it wasn't that great.

It was the worst I have ever stayed in. You must check in at the hotel, and then drag your luggage down the street and around the corner where the apt building is located in a graffiti filled alleyway. We were informed there was no telephone, but there was, it was simply not working / no line? The elevator in the building can only fit one person with one suitcase at a time. You are given one set of keys; one key for the front door of the apt building and one key for your door. What a hassle. How do four people get in and out of the apt with one key? It's not like a hotel, where you can walk in and knock on your door to be let into your room. There is no one in attendance in the apt lobby, the front door is locked, and remember, there is no telephone to call up to the room. It was extremely annoying. The worst aspect of this though, is the fact that the front door to the building automatically locks from the inside also. You need the key to get OUT of the building. It made me sick to think if there was ever a fire in this place. Scrambling to unlock doors,or, what if your friend has the key and they are out of the building, and of course, no phone to call for help. For this reason alone, this place was unacceptable. The apt itself looks like it was last remodeled in 1978. The icing on the cake for me was when we were leaving. We dragged our suitcases back to the hotel to check out and we were pretty tired. We asked to use the phone to call a taxi, and the desk clerk adamantly refused to let us use it, or call one himself. I reminded him that there was no telephone in our apt, and we would gladly pay for the call, but again, the answer was \"no\". This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.

Our double room was dark (when will Europeans decide that some at least of their guests like reading in their rooms?) and not very large, but this is apparently the norm in the older parts of the city and in an old building. And the A/C and cozy room is welcome after hot Roman streets. Besides you can always go to the roof and sit comfortably on one of the three terraces, imbibing and nibbling, if you've brought your own food and drink. The view is just what you want in the evening before going out to dinner. There is late-night noise from the crowds in the Campo, but it's filtered by good windows and curtains so that we had no trouble sleeping. Everything is up-to-date in the hotel and having free LAN service is in itself a reason to stay here, since some hotels, even high-end ones, charge through the nose for wi-fi. Breakfast is uninspiring--no cooked food--but included in the room rate. One can always go out to a local cafe for something better. There is a laundry around the corner in the Campo itself. The hotel also rents apartments in the neighborhood, we understand, which would be the best choice for a stay of more than three or four days.

We had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend it. The reason we picked it initially was because of the central location, and this didn't disappoint. You're about 5 minutes from Piazza Navonna - and all of the other main tourist sites in Rome are within walking distance (we spent 4 days sightseeing and walked everywhere). The hotel is on a small side street just off the Campo de' Fiori square. I probably would never have visited the Campo de' Fiori if we hadn't been staying here, but I was really glad we did. There's a fantastic selection of bars and restaurants on the square, and we found them to be just a little bit less busy and less touristy than Piazza Navonna. (There's a branch of the Obika mozzarella restaurant which is particularly good if you want a lunch of - well - cheese!) Our room was small (but not terribly small by continental European standards) but decorated to an incredibly luxurious standard. As lots of the other reviewers have said, the roof terrace is a stand out feature - you've got views over the rooftops of Rome. There's no bar on the roof, but they seem happy for you to take your own drinks up there. The only disappointing aspect for me was breakfast (and this is the reason I haven't given it a 5 star review). It was billed as a continental breakfast but mainly consisted of long life croissants and bread, and not much else.

I received prompt and friendly replies to my emails from Olga, Valentina and Angelo, who explained they have standard and deluxe rooms, plus 2 with balcony on the top floor, giving lovely views. They offered me a good discount, so I booked one of the top floor rooms for 4 nts ( mon- fri) The hotel will book car transfer to/from the airport for you, at a fixed rate of 50 euros each way. We decided to book a shuttle through Viator.com from Fiumicino airport to the hotel, for 35 euros, and to book a car for our return trip. Although we found the shuttle desk without a problem, there was a queue of people also booking hotels. Only one person was serving so we had a long wait, and then had to wait again for the next shuttle. We wasted about 2 hours at the airport, but were pleased when the shuttle was an air conditioned Mercedes, that took us to the hotel door. LOCATION The hotel is literally just around the corner from the Piazza Campo De'Fiori where there is a market every morning. This is cleared away by late afternoon, and in the evening the piazza is buzzing with people and musicians. There are restaurants, trattorias and bars all around the piazza, which stay open until late.The hotel is soundproofed, so no worries about noise at night. In Italy some restaurants close after 3pm, but we found that most stayed open all day, so no problem getting food and drinks. The location is excellent, and we walked to all the sights; 10 min to Piazza Navona, with Trevi Fountain and Pantheon just beyond. 20 min to Castel Sant'Angelo, Vatican Museums and St Peter's Basilica. 20 min to Colosseum and Forum. This was at a leisurely walking pace. HOTEL It was very hot when we arrived, and walked into the cool, peaceful hotel entrance. There is classical music playing quietly. Matteo was at reception, speaks excellent English with an American accent. Very welcoming, and gave us a map of the city. There is a small lounge on the left. The hotel decor is very elegant with chandeliers and vaulted ceilings. There is a room to store baggage, and a W.C.( take a look- very grand, with fresh towels.) There is also a small writing area. The bedrooms are on 6 floors. The lift goes up to floor 5. There is a small flight of wooden stairs from here to the 2 balcony rooms, and the door to the rooftop terrace. The 360 degree view from the Terrace is spectacular. Worth taking binoculars to pick out the sights. Good view of St Peter's Dome to the west- beautiful at sunset. The hotel does not have a bar, but you can take your own drinks up to the terrace. Pack a bottle opener/ corkscrew. There are drinking glasses in the room. OUR ROOM We had room number 602, and this was really the icing on the cake. Definitely worth the extra cost. Decorated in green and gold,comfortable king sized bed ( 4 pillows), writing desk, armchair, double wardrobe. Minibar/ fridge with 2 complimentary bottles of water and safe. Flat screen TV on the wall, inside a gold frame. Chandelier, faux candle wall lights. Lace curtains over sliding doors to large balcony. Great view to the east. We could see the white National Monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II on the Piazza Venezia in the distance.Known as the Wedding Cake. Lovely sitting in the early morning sunshine, listening to church bells ringing, and relaxing at night to the sounds and music from the piazza round the corner. When we closed the doors, it was silent in the room. Modern shower room ( no bath) HUGE showerhead! Also a separate hand shower.Black wall and floor tiles, loo/bidet, sink, mirror, hairdryer. Plenty of towels, changed every day. There are speakers in the ceiling so you can hear the TV! CNN and BBC World news. Some toiletries are provided. The room was a good size. The other top floor room is similar, but faces west, with views of the Vatican. BREAKFAST This is taken on the lower ground floor ( -1) accessed by stairs or lift. Two joining rooms with vaulted ceiling. Buffet laid out, tea and coffee is brought to you. Coffee with hot milk is known as American coffee. You can also have expresso or cappuccino. Very cool and restful, with classical music playing quietly. Small elegant tables, antique bookcases. Breakfast consists of fruit salad ( yes it is tinned, but very nice) bread rolls, cheese, ham, yoghurts, cereals and cake. Croissants and biscuits in wrappers on your table, with jam, honey,marmalade. Ask if you want butter. Juices in a jug. It was plenty to set us up for the day. The hotel give you a map of the city, but we used the AA Rome city guidebook. Has clear maps of each area, plus a wipe- clean map of the city in large print. We also used Baedeker Rome book for info about the sights, as this contains site plans. Very useful, and saved paying 7 euros for an audio guide at each place. You can use the hop on/ off 110 tour bus. Does a round trip in about 2 hours for 8 euros. Stop and go day ticket costs 13 euros. We preferred to walk, as you see other sights on the way. Lots of churches!! There are always guides offering guided tours outside the sights. I read on Trip Advisor that Angel Tours are well recommended. Always carry water with you, as some sights do not have refreshments once inside. Advise trainers ( not sandals) for the Forum, as dusty and gritty. I carried a small umbrella ( you can buy paper parasols) as a sunshade, and took a small battery fan. That was a godsend at times. We prebooked Vatican Museum tickets online from the Vatican's website, for 9am and spent all day there. Tried to get tickets for the Scavi Tour ( underground tombs) but was full- you have to book way ahead for this. Had a fantastic trip, but still more to see, so want to return one day. Will definitely stay at the Campo De'Fiori.

We also loved the fact that it was tucked off the Piazza Campo di Fiori which whilst still full of tourists, felt slightly more authentically Roman - a great place to people watch and enjoy a beer or wine in the evening. The rooms are absolutely tiny - I'm guessing all the rooms are small but we paid \u20ac300 per night for a triple and the extra bed was a camp bed against the wall which amounted to about 1/2m of clearance between the double and the campbed. The bathroom was equally small with just a shower so we really struggled to manage logistics getting ready in the morning and going to bed - not quite what I had expected for the money. However, petit was balanced with a certain amount of bijoux - the rooms were interestingly (! - see the 'gold' beading round the TV...) furnished with dark green walls and a chandelier and the bathroom was faux marble effect. With flimsy curtains, the overall effect was quite dark and tacky but at least the room was clean enough. The public spaces were better decorated and the outside terrace was lovely, if too windy to actually use when we were there. Breaksfasts were at best adequate (coffee/tea, juices from cartons, cold meats, cheeses, cereal, fruit, prepacked 'plastic' croissants) but were a bit of an insult given the prices being charged, especially as there is a fabulous baker, Il Fornaio, just around the corner. A couple of other things annoyed me - the one lift in the hotel is pretty claustrophobic, taking 3 people max and the hotel staff seemed to permanently occupy it and to think it was their own private lift, I could sense the housekeeping staff rolling their eyes a couple of times as if I was inconveniencing them when I tried to squeeze in alongside them. On check out, we were the only guests waiting but had to wait for 15mins until the girl at the front desk worked through the housekeeping roster with housekeeping. When, she finally got round to checking us out - she gave me my bill in Euros and then processed my bill in GBP, with a poorer exchange rate than my Visa card would have given me, without informing me.

I had read reviews that the rooms were small but 'small' is a bit of an understatement... ours was tiny. There was barely enough room for the bed, and literally just a narrow space around it, though they have squeezed in a small dressing table and a tiny pouffe on which to sit at it. There was nowhere to put our suitcases except in the wardrobe, one at ground level, and nowhere to sit except on the bed. No chairs! No room for them. The bath room has no bath, just a shower, which admittedly is rather plush. So I suppose you could say the room was 'intimate', and the bed was certainly very comfortable and it was all cosy and finished to a high standard, but really, I'm not sure I would be able to offer it with a clean conscience as a double room if I ran a hotel. Change the double for a single bed and stick a chair in there... but then you'd probably not rent it half the time. On the plus side, the staff were very helpful, polite and friendly at all times. The internet only worked once by ethernet cable but thereafter I was given a WiFi access code, which was fine. If you're big on breakfast, sadly the breakfast falls rather short... there's nothing cooked, and everything is very processed: cold meats and cheese were not your typical Italian style but more like what you'd buy in Asda in the UK. Individually-packaged 'croissants' with long best-before dates; tinned fruit salad; supermarket yogurts, and milk left out to lose its chill; juices with indiscernible flavours and unnatural colours. Um-Bongo anyone? And finally, the cappuccino was just filter coffee with frothed milk on top -- I'm afraid I wasn't fooled. Okay so I understand they want to keep costs down by offering a breakfast that doesn't require more than a single member of staff to cater for the entire hotel, but we'd rather have paid more and had better. To redress the balance slightly for all that moaning (hey I'm British), I can say that the location is absolutely stunning, the views from the roof garden are stunning, the staff excellent, and on the whole we enjoyed our stay tremendously and would stay here again... we just might just lower our breakfast expectations, or grab breakfast in one of the many cafes around the Campo. --", "Date": "February 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "minster", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, brilliant location, fantastic staff.\u201d", "Author": "gbajz", "ReviewID": "UR22831820", "Content": "A lovely hotel in a fantastic position we managed to walk to all the attractions easily.

Walking in the front door right around the corner from the bustling campo de fiori market place, I knew I had found the perfect little hotel. The arched wooden bookcase behind the front desk, the silver room keys in velvet boxes, the cozy sitting area furnished with traditional Italian furniture. There is a tiny lift to take your bags up to your room where you will find a heavy wooden door leading into small room with shuttered windows draped in silk, a dark wood beamed ceiling with a small crystal chandelier hanging from the center. The room is furnished with Venetian style furniture but has a very modern bathroom. You put your clothes away in a polished wooden cabinet. Every detail adds to the charm of the small room. One marvelous feature of the hotel is its beautiful roof terrace with wicker chairs and tables and comfortable lounge chairs. When it's time for siesta - grab a pizza from any of the local shops and head up to the terrace to realax, eat ,and enjoy the sunshine overlooking the city. The hotel is located within walking distance of any of the important sites you want to see in Rome. We walked everywhere. The campo de fiori itself can be very noisy at night as it is a popular gathering place for young people. But the good windows in the Hotel shut out most of the noise except for a background hum and the occasional burst of song which is just Rome by night. The breakfast room is exquisite with its Venetian painted barrel vaulted ceiling, a beautul wood Venetian bookcase across the back of the room and traditonal small tables and chairs set with linen and china. Bread, cheese, cereal, yogurt, fruit cocktail juices and coffee are offered. The front desk is helpful with directions, transfers etc. Prices are competitive with other small hotels in the 3 star category - but after peeking inside a few of the others, there is no comparison.

The roof top terrace is great. there are couches and chairs to sit on to admire the views and take in the sun. The hotel staff were all friendly and accomodating.

The first regarded taxis to be booked to the airport on our departure. The lady on reception accused us ordering a cab to De Vinci when infact we had asked her to book for Campiano. There was such an issue made about this and she just kept accusing us of being wrong, instead of just ordering an another cab. When another cab eventually arrived yet again (in italian)she went on to tell the driver it was our fault, it was actually getting embaressing at this stage. We also found the staff there to be quite abrupt, but put this down to a language barrier. There are no facilties in the rooms for tea/coffe etc. so we had takeaway coffees and we assumed it would be OK to have these in our room, yet again this was frowned upon. However we foolishly booked again to stay here in March as the location of the Hotel is excellent. We will never stay here again. After paying nearly 800 euros for a four night stay we were called to the desk. The same lady who we had the issue with during our previous stay proceeded to tell us that the room we we had been staying in was non smoking. We did smoke in this room as there were ashtrays in the room and no-one had told us otherwise. We then asked why were we not informed it was non smoking and she then said that we could actually smoke in the room but we should have opened the window. We HAD the windows constantly open as the room was unbearably hot and also had a strange smell. We were indeed going to ask reception about this at the beginning of our stay but just thought we would let it go. Yet again this converstaion turned into a major issue were she made us feel like school children and yet again as guests we were shown no respect whatsoever. The day staff here really need to lighten up abit. They believe they are right no matter what the circumstance. It is such a shame as the hotel is really nice and the location is great, which is why we did not mind paying the extra money. They also really need to have more facilities in the rooms if they are going to frown upon a takeaway coffee being brought to the room. The staff who were working in the evening/night shifts were lovely, and helpful at all times. If you are a young couple who would like to sample the nightlife in Rome - do not stay here.

Located in the Campo De Fiori piazza area there are plenty of bars, restuarants, shops, etc to keep you busy. Also most sights you would want to see are just a short walk or an easy bus ride away. Franco and his staff will be happy to guide you anywhere. I just want to say when I return to Rome, soon, I will be staying at the Hotel Campo De Fiori and can not wait to be greated by Franco, Andreas, Angelo, & Michael. Make it easy on yourself and stay at a fantastic Italian hotel.. Contact them @ hotelcampodefiori.com PS... The best pizza place in Italy, Baffetto \"2\" is just around the corner.

The busy square is virtually just outside the door and most attractions are in walking distance. The recent refurbishment is very stylish with a modern edge to the old world charm, combining items such as chandeliers, purple walls and silk curtains. Sounds strange but it works! The rooms are small, but have everything you need including flat screen TV, ours had a tiny balcony overlooking the roof tops of the old city. The small bathroom was very modern with an excellent shower. Although looking incomplete (like empty window boxes) the roof top terrace offers magnificent views over the city. The staff are efficent, but perhaps a little smug, and the breakfast is not really worth turning up for!

We had reserved an apartment which turned out to be right off the piazza. After traversing a dark corridor with a rusty moped parked inside, we arrived at our second-story rooms. One bedroom (with a strange cot attached to a chair) was right over the square, with preparations for market starting at 5 am. Although clean, the furnishings were sparse - the \"courtyard patio\" consisted of a rickety plastic table and a cut-off garden hose on a sink faucet. The hotel staff treated us as an ugly stepchild, with no maid service, no breakfast, and no help w/our luggage - all this for 200 euros a night. There was no airconditioning, but they did provide us with another fan so we could attempt to cool the place. Fortunately, we were so tired at days' end, we did sleep. The hotel looked nice, but we never made it past the lobby. When checking out, we informed them of leakage around the toilet, and they didn't particularly seem concerned - almost as if we had done something. The location was great - walking to many sites was easily accomplished, and the piazza is charming.

Eventually they found our booking and off we went - they didn't inform us about breakfast or anything - but we weren't bothered to be honest - you don't really go to Rome to stay in the hotel! The place was being renovated - but there was a (very tiny!) working lift. Our room was dark blue (makes it seem smaller) and designed cave-like. Very small en-suite off the room and a wardrobe. The en-suite although tiny was totally clean and plenty of towels available. The shower was a rain shower - totally fab. There was a flat screen plasma on the wall and internet was available. There was also a working saferty deposit box in the wardrobe. Never saw a roof garden. Breakfast was across the road in a cafe, croissants, coffee; very simple and you pay with a voucher the hotel gives you. It wasn't noisy at night at all, but we were situated in the middle of the building - looking out in to another room across the courtyard! (not really a courtyard - just a small area, not for customers) It is a grand place to stay, no hassle and really good location for all the sights.

You are within walking distance to many central tourist sites in Rome. We were on the 3rd floor.. and there's no elevator! This is a negative if you have lots of luggage/shopping bags. No bell boy to carry your bags either. Also the hallways are a little dark. Breakfast was decent. Fresh cappucinos, warm rolls with pate, jams, and nutella. Also, resh yogurt, cereals, juice.

The old hotel before the modernization was a wonderful and charming European style hotel with a very friendly staff, good rates and a wonderful roof garden. When we decided to go to Rome in December 2006, there was no doubt in our minds that we should stay at Hotel Campo De Fiori. The rates had more than doubled since we stayed there the last time, but that was OK because we expected improvements. When we arrived, we soon discovered that the renovation process was still very much going on. The much advertised roof garden was closed, and the breakfast restaurant wasn\u2019t finished either. The room was nice enough, but the included breakfast had to be consumed in an unheated and not very clean snack bar across the street. We complained to the service desk, and after much discussion we were sourly offered a 10% discount. The staff was rude, and we were ripped off. We did not want to change hotel, because we were only in Rome for a few days, and we did not want to waste time by moving around. But you should make sure that the roof garden and the breakfast restaurant is finished before making a reservation.
