{"Reviews": [{"Content": "absolute gorgeous n relaxing Bland on 1 st impression. even a bit spooky as we arrive late.. Reception counter just a table. BUT STAFF are courteous n always ready to assist yet unobtrusive. Stayed 2 nights in deluxe room. View of Sg Ayung n surrounding valley breathtaking especially in the misty early morning.. Felt real good just taking in deep inhalation. Both bedrom , bathroom are hugh. Jacuzzi works well. Guessed staff made effort to clear the swimming pool ( quite small tho) of fallen leaves n debris prior to our arrival. Cud see young naked children frolicking in the river as well as rafters.in the evening. Moved over to standard superior room as other had prebooked on 3rd night.. Staff did well to clean up before we change over.,. breakfast however simple toast, eggs, fruit, beverage daily.. Only setback it's distance to ubud market. We did some trekking once n arrive main bazaar after 40 mins walk.. quite fun to do it once. Along the way there'll be transport offers ranging 10000-20000baht for 2 person 1 way. They also oblige with late check out n even showering in one of the room. Great stay ! Luv it !", "Date": "Sep 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR394175624", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "june31"}, {"Content": "Absolutely disgusting! I honestly do not know how there are any positive reviews about this hotel. First of all when I arrived with my partner they had no idea who I was because my name was not on any booking list. \u9225\u6de3ot to worry\u9225? they said, \u9225\u6e28e have room\u9225?...Of course they had room, no one could possibly want to stay there. The pool was BROWN and I mean there could have been ducks in it brown! My lovely driver inquired about the state of the pool, to which the reply was we don't use that pool anymore... You don't say! There are, however, pictures of this pool (as being clean) when you book online. There was another pool that was clean (or rather cleaner) because I am sure it would not have met safety standards. The rooms were damp and smelt rotten with very little natural light. The only good thing about the place is the view, ah the view could take your breath away... but let\u9225\u6a9a not kid ourselves, one nice view is not worth a brown pool and cave-like room.Needless to say, I did not stay at this hotel. It was too awful (and I have stayed in some pretty bad hotels in Ubud) and too far from the town centre.I must say that the company we booked through were very helpful and refunded my deposit since the Puri Bunga did not have my booking. So this review is nothing bad against the travel company, I believe they themselves are being misled with out of date photos (the pool pictures they have are certainly not septic tank coloured).All in all, I would suggest you only stay at this hotel if you do not mind a dank room, hate swimming and wish to enjoy a view. The cheap deals for this place exist because of its condition and they are obviously desperate to keep guests coming despite the place slowly falling apart.Alas, I have no pictures to show you as I left as soon as I had been shown a room (that is to day after my partner insisted I at least see a room after I went running back to the car upon sighting the pool, really I harp on because it was that bad, believe me).", "Date": "Sep 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR926923549", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Travelbug383"}, {"Content": "Wonderful peace  The place is about a 5 min drive from central Ubud. The trick to staying here is to patronise outlets which provide shuttle services from your hotel. A majority of the restaurants and spas will help get you to their outlet and safely back to your hotel at no additional charge.A private taxi ride for some nearby shopping and sightseeing will cost roughly Rp20,000.The rooms are clean and huge. My Deluxe Suite included a jacuzzi!Wonderful view of Ayung River, with rafters going by at about 11am daily.Staff were helpful and totally unobtrusive. They were even willing to give us a late check-out of 5pm!Definitely a great experience!", "Date": "Aug 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR548964254", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "gregyoon-kl"}, {"Content": "total relaxation       view from deluxe room balcony", "Date": "Aug 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR564035723", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "beautifulbali"}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue76c\u5132\u9289\u51b2\u7a9b\u9287\ue1bd\u7b13\u748b\u98ce\u7de8\u9287\u5c80\u6e82\u9353\u5d83\u4f00\u6434\u51a6\u4eb4\u9288\u5a3f\u4f28\u9287\u6b0d\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(22855422, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR827131140", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "HOTEL EPOUVENTABLE   showReview(17743746, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR560926785", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "GLOBWOMEN"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d309324-r19777763-Puri_Bunga_Village_Hotel-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "309324", "Price": "$48"}}
