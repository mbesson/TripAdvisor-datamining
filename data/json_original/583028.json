He demonstrated everything in the room and was very keen to impress. The beds were comfortable, the linen clean and white and the pillows plump. The bathroom was also clean and tidy. The only gripe was the shower curtain. I hate shower curtains generally and I swear this one had a mind of it's own and was determined to allow me only about 6 inches between it and the wall opposite. The breakfast was fine. The usual selection of hot and cold food - asian and western - with plenty of coffee and tea and juices. Great location next to Bras Basah MRT stop so the train from the airport is virtually door-to-door. Bugis market is but a short walk away.

We walked back from Orchard Road and also back from the Marina Bay Sands hotel, via a number of air-con malls of course!

Bizarrely, this hotel has done away with the reception counter and replaced it with individual desks, so you feel like you're going up to your boss when you check in. With this ridiculous design innovation the hotel is telling you who's in charge, and it isn't you. But I deliberately chose this hotel\u2014friends stayed there during a previous visit of mine\u2014because of its excellent location. It is right across the Singapore Art Museum and just down the road from Nathan. Raffles is a short stroll away and the exquisitely Gothic Chimes even nearer. The design of the rooms, with a glass bowl sink over a glass counter in the bathrooms and flat screen TVs in front of the beds, is now looking a little dated, but their condition is still mint. It's undoubtedly the value of the quality of the rooms and the hotel's prime location that draws heavy traffic to the hotel. Unfortunately, the traffic seems to have worn down the staff, and, to me, the staff manning those ludicrous desks seem to have been swept away into a torpor by a profound sense of futility. What can it all mean, they seem to be thinking to themselves as they check you in.

This means it is not too expensive. However, it is located to the best advantage of a stopover tourist - quite in the centre of Singapore and close to every central site. It is not more than a five minutes walk to Bras Basah subway station, about 30 to 40 minutes to the Flyer, about the same to the nearest boat station. So you may get yout and start walking in any direction you may choose. I spent almost one and a half day there - arrived in the evening of day 1 and booked the second day in full, as I was leaving late at night. The room was wide and clean, there is nothing superfluous in the design, just the necessary things. The bathroom was also roomy, everything there is operable and cleam, What else can I say? It was a little bit noisy outdoors, as there is a kind of restaurant in the same street, and they had a sort of celebration there (a wedding, I guess, or something as great), but it did not last for too long - maybe ten minutes of noise in the whole night. Otherwise the street the hotel is in is not busy at all, there is hardly any traffic at all. I overslept my breakfast, so cannot tell anything about it. What I really did not understand, is why they switched on the central air conditioner at some moment, when I was away from the room on my second day. When I returned back from my city rush, it was as frosty as during the Russian winter. Even the windows got damp from OUTSIDE (the thing I have never ever seen before). Maybe it was the maid, who arranged some cold weather inside after cleaning the room. Who knows... Anyway, as there was nothing of that kind on my first day, perhaps it is not an automatic thing, and probably I could settle it at the reception, but I was leaving on the same day, so I did not care. Anyway, the room got its right temperature very quickly, and there were no problems ever since. So I give it a \"four\" only for this slight disconvenience. All other aspects were simply fine: the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and the sights nearby. The transfer service to and from the airport was also fine, not a minute was lost. One small advice to photographers: take care of your cameras, as air conditioning in public places is bitter (Royal hotel is not the only place that tries to compensate for the outdoor warmth). It will get your lense wet from inside as soon as you get outdoors. This may cost you a few precious minutes that you will be trying to wait till the fog disappears (I won't say anything about electronics, mine was fine after all). So when you are planning your route, try to arrange it so as not to mix in- and outdoors too much. P.S. The bright spot in my photos is not a picture or abstract painting - it is a wall of a building opposite the hotel. In overall, it gives a very specific view to the whole room, but it is not obtrusive - to see the abstractionism, you will have to look out the window.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei", "Title": "\u201cGood location. <2 min walk from Bras Basah metro station.

The hotel safety was also a plus point, since you will need the room key card to use almost all of the facility in the hotel such as elevators, gym, and swimming pool, so only the hotel guest and hotel employee have the access for it.

Unfortunately the Royal At Queens Hotel is just like most other hotels in Singapore, presuming that because you are prepared to spend decent money for the hotel they can charge you ridiculous amounts for everything else - $8 for a beer; that is criminal, from a hotel that charges over $150 AUD per night! I don\u2019t expect it to change, but I don\u2019t have to like it, and it\u2019s a big part of why I only ever stop over in Singapore, rather than consider it a tourist destination in itself.

All had connecting doors, which I was assured were well noise insulated, but on my second night I was disturbed continually by next door residents (only talking!). Room amenities (shampoo etc) were clearly the cheapest they could buy and the shower curtain had been badly located so that it made the space to shower about 300mm wide - so it kept sticking to me throughout. No free water bottles were provided, so it was either buy from the mini-bar or go out to a shop - unforgivable in a humid climate. Internet was not cheap and frankly was unusable - it took me 10 mins+ to check in online! At least they credited this on my bill.

Nice touch controls 3) Can get this hotel really cheap (Dont book on the hotel website, will get 20-40% cheaper on agoda, dizzy goat etc or best search on wego.com) Negatives : 1) Terrible check-in procedure. Most of the ppl at the front desk look drained out at most times. They rarely smile and are just not interested 2) As we checked in around 11 AM we were told the room is not available (which is ok as the check in time was 2 PM) but the lady (and Mr.MANI) also said there was no double room until next day. Thats ridiculous. And believe me she did not care. 3) The hotel staff treat you as if they have obliged you by giving you a room. And because they know its cheap they treat you accordingly 4) There was no one at the entry gates to welcome the guests. No one to call the taxi. No one to help with luggage. Its like a really low cost airline service 5) After a long day at the universal studious we came back in the evening at 6 PM to see that the room was not cleaned. The house keeping said (Lady named Grace) she was busy with the check-out rooms. Lost it there. 6) The lobby itself looked like a storage place. Luggage everywhere. 7) No food options. Tough for vegetrarians Simply avoid this place unless we wish to overlook everythign cos of the location. Also, dont go by the positive reviews recently. They are incorrect.

So, once we got up to the rooms we realised and just swapped over, but it was an annoying start to the stay. The other negative was the crappy wifi - only available in the reception/breakfast area and required a log in from the reception desk. Wifi didn't always work and the log in info from reception sometimes didn't work because it had already been used by someone else or was out of date ... and if the wifi dropped out it logged you off and yet another log in was needed to get back on.

The room itself is well maintained and has a good system of one single controller near the bed to control all the lights and a separate alarm clock for the occupants. The bell-boys and service personnel were most helpful in sharing information, the hotel also has a tour desk which is most helpful. The hotel swimming pool is rather dissapointing and did not see any activity out there for the period of stay. The breakfast has a good spread for all and is usually part of the package for Lunch and dinner there are several option which are much cheaper close to the hotel. The hotel is close to the MRT station, but a bit away from the Hop on bus stop, which is more helpful for tourists.

Location: This hotel is just 10 steps away from Singapore Art Museum - this is a lovely surprise as we booked this hotel through our Singaporean friends. As both of us love arts and also to see culturous stuff, our friends had chosen this hotel for us and I think they made a good choice. Besides the Art Museum, which is only short walking distance (it is just right at the side of the hotel), a building mostly occupied by book shops (\u767e\u80dc\u697c in Chinese) is just at the back of this hotel - you may pass through the back door which linked to another hotel at its back. From this hotel, we walked to Clarke Quay which took us around 20 mins. It is easy as we don't have to make so many turns - just go out from its back door and turn to the right and go straight. On our way to Clarke Quay, we passed by many historical buildings/sites of Singapore. I also walked alone from Chinatown to this hotel. It took me around 35 mins to do so. By the way, there is one MRT station (under construction) right in front of this hotel. Besides, Many museums are just walking distant around this hotel. Hotel Room: Clean. with a big and wide LCD TV and lots of channels to choose from! I like the toilet. It is clean and the design is good. Buffet Breakfast is included. The taste of the food are ok.

Unfortunately we were here for a week. Initial reaction was \"small room, nicely re-decorated, but what's that smell??? \" Noticed there was what looked like mold on the walls beneath the new wall paper and a sewer gas smell coming from the bathroom. Must admit the other room my colleague was in didn't smell and seemed slightly larger. Nice neutral modern decor. The bedding was good - feather duvets and pillows. No other choices offerred for pillows and they were rather too soft but we survived. Towels were tiny and well used, but clean. Shower over bath was very narrow. Fought with the shower curtain every morning but plenty of hot water and good pressure. Only 3 english tv channels - Channel 5, espn and CNN - no discovery channel , most unusual. There is a broadband outlet in the room but no wifi. You can borrow a cable or use the spare computer in the tiny business centre office at $6 an hour for internet access. The staff were very good, polite and efficient - no complaints. An additional swipe card key was available but not offerred on check-in. We had to ask and pay a $3 cash bond for the 2nd card but it was worth it. If there is an emergency an automated voice message is transmitted thru speakers in the hall ways. I know this as it went off at 7am one morning. We had no idea what it was saying until the \"All clear - sorry for the false alarm\" message was transmitted. Good thing there wasn't a real fire or bomb scare. Breakfast - Quantity not quality is the focus here. Cereal is either cornflakes or Cocopops, two types of bread for toast, you can get an omlette made on the spot by a chef (which is worth the queue), bacon - lots but dried out and fatty, hash browns (found them on the last day in the asian food section, asian breakfast section - yes, fresh fruit - melons, pineapple, apples (no bananas), apple or orange juice, coffee, tea and warm milk - ewwwww (no cold milk), pastries and yogurt. As I said... lots of food but not the greatest quality. And we also have to add that we sufferred 2 attacks of delhi belly a few hours after eating breakfast on two different days - and it was the only time we all ate the same things. Coincidense maybe??? ...but I don't think so. The buffet dinner was a very cheap $12 per person - but there was significantly less to eat than breakfast and the quality was even worse (if that's possible). We invited people to join us for a meal and were very embarrassed. There is a small gym with a running machine, cross trainer and exercycle - all good quality and in good condition. The pool is hard to find and just a lap pool really. You MUST shower before entering the pool - WHY???? because the signs command it. Eating out - exit the hotel and turn right, walk for 1 block and enter a newish shopping centre on the right. Take the escalator to the 4th floor. Avoid the asian chicken rice place and head for the steak house in the middle. The steak, chips and veges are excellent - but ask for no seasoning unless you adore salt/pepper/paprika for africa on everything. OR exit the lift on level 2 of the hotel, go thru the glass doors into the Allson hotel, exit thru the Allson hotel entrance and turn left. There is a good food court there with lots of local traders or further along the street, diagonally opposite at the traffic lights, under the Intercontinental Hotel there is a great shopping centre with lots of eateries. There is also a huge night market nearby. Turn right coming out of the hotel and walk two blocks. Walk past the fruit shops and the entrance is right there. Great for last minute souvenir and gift shopping. Last advice, bring earplugs as the corridors get noisy with other guests banging doors and talking loudly at any hour of the day or night.

Many aspects of the hotel are very good, but it falls down on others. My room was stylishly designed with appearance in mind more than function. Most of the lights were controlled only from a panel next to the bed, meaning one has to walk across the room to switch on or off a nearby light. The armchair was in a dark corner of the room, useless for reading. There was a large flat-screen television, and an in-room safe with a power outlet inside for charging laptops while locked away. High-speed (wired) broadband was included in the cost of the room. The bed was comfortable, and although my room faced the street I heard no traffic noise. Alas, mechanical noises of the building (even with the room's air-conditioning turned off) were so loud as to disrupt sleep; I had to resort to ear-plugs. The curtains were fully light-tight, but the glow of the light-switch panel was sufficient to light up the room like a bright night-light. Bathroom amenities included all the usual little bottles and boxes. The bathroom design was far too hip to have towel rails or lighting adequate for shaving or make-up. The shaving/make-up mirror was badly placed, as was the shower curtain (several centimetres further into the tub than necessary). The breakfast buffet offered plenty of choice, but the quality was mediocre. My primary displeasure was the persistent, and sometimes strong, smell of sewer gas in the bathroom, which I was unable to diagnose. At first I thought that someone was eating durians next door, but it became clear, after a couple of days, that the smell (which was only in the bathroom) was coming from the plumbing. Pouring water down the floor drain, in case it was just due to a dry trap, did not help.

The service apartment is essentially two connecting hotel rooms, but one of the rooms has been converted into a living room with a full kitchen. We stayed at the Allson back in 2006, and I do not remember being impressed by the connected Royal @ Queens then, but it has clearly undergone a major renovation. Pros: 1) Location. It is a 10-minute walk to either the City Hall MRT station (Raffles City) or the Bugis MRT station (Bugis Junction). There are plenty of shops for the non-Orchard Road shopping experience, and food is everywhere with Chijmes one block away and plenty of restaurants and food courts in the area. Being able to cut through the connected Allson hotel (on the second floor, not first) to get to Victoria Street is nice too. 2) Comfort. The newly refurbished rooms are very comfortable. The service apartment included large, LCD televisions in both the bedroom and living room (only the one in the bedroom included a DVD player). My six-year-old could have amused herself for hours playing with the fancy panels that control all the lights. There was a king-size bed in the bedroom, and the couch folds out into a super-single or double bed. Also, we received a complimentary cot. Thus, there was plenty of room for the 4 of us. Finally, the kitchen included a large (for a hotel room) refrigerator with a separate freezer, a microwave, an oven, a stove, and even a washing machine. 3) Did I mention the washing machine? It took about 3-4 hours to wash and dry one load (the unit does both the washing and drying), but we were so happy to have a place to do our laundry without paying hotel, per piece prices or sending it out to some unknown laundrette. 4) Breakfast. The buffet breakfast we received with the room was not spectacular, but it had a variety of eastern and western foods, was well stocked, and hit the spot. 5) Staff. The reception staff was helpful, allowing us to extend our stay for an extra night at the discount rate we received from booking.com. Even better Cons: 1) Swimming pool. It really is comically small. You access it via the 4th floor, where you can see the Allson's pool. That pool is by no means large, but the pool area itself is nice. By contrast, the pool at the Royal @ Queens seems like an afterthought. After you go outside on the 4th floor, there is one table and a small shower area. You then must climb a flight of stairs to find this sliver of a pool deck. It appears to have a small wading area for kids, but I honestly do not think that it is more than 8-feet wide or 25-feet long. It might give the kids a chance to splash about and cool off, but there will be no swimming or lounging around the pool here. 2) Internet. S$6/hour. Now, I was told on our last day that there was no charge for me to use the internet in the business centre, so it may come with the service apartment. However, when we checked in, we were told that the internet cost S$6/hour. Overall, for the same price we paid for the Holiday Inn Park View, we got almost twice the space, a kitchen, two large televisions, a DVD player, free breakfast, and a similar 8-10 minute walk to the nearest MRT station.

Technicians came to our door right after check-in, and asked to come in to fix the phones, saying we had asked for it to be fixed. I explained we had just checked in and nothing seemed to be wrong with the phone. They insisted on coming in. I said we were resting and if they could return another time. Again, they insisted on coming in. Rude! 5. Internet. I was under the impression that Singapore was a hi-tech country. The hotel doesn't have wi-fi. They will lend you a network cable at the hotel counter for your plugged in browsing experience. Having kids, this is definitely not an idea solution, having a long cable running across the hotel room. And at $6 Singapore Dollars and hour, I feel like I am being robbed. 6. There is a large LCD TV in our room, but the reception is terrible. Lmost every channel has static. 7. Don't be fooled about its location. The Royal @ Queens is a long way from Orchard Road.

The rooms were supposed to have been newly renovated and the staff seemed very proud to show them off to us!!! But have to say the rooms were amazing. There were touch screen controls for everything - lights, door bell, make up room and do not disturb. Everything could be controlled from the bed side. There was a 40\" LCD TV - which did have some problem of being fused out when we arrived but they corrected it very quickly after we mentioned it to them. The bathrooms were great with a tub and very clean. The view from the top was gorgeous and you could a whole lot of the city. We enjoyed looking out of the floor to top windows whenever we had a chance. Beds were soft and lovely, fell asleep as soon as we got into them. Staff were very helpful and would correct anything quickly if we needed. The buffet breakfast the next day had the usual choices. I guess it was the usual, standard fare that is available everywhere \u2013 nothing special. We had to wait for a long time almost always to get into the crowded breakfast room as there were many tour groups staying at the hotel. All the days we were there it was really full with many tour groups coming and going. We did order room service for dinner once and have to say the food is terrible here and comes quite a bit of time after ordering, so you would do better to just go to any of the great restaurants in Singapore or even the food courts. We went into one of the food courts once but you better be sure you know what you are getting and ask the locals if it is anything good for a foreign taste as sometimes strange tastes otherwise get into your plates. (Well we do like to experiment with food so would try out new stuff \u2013 but some of the food on offer is really strange for foreign tongues). But if you have a local with you, you can get amazing food at the food courts. Back to the hotel, the swimming pool is on the rooftop and is dismally small - like 3 bath tubs put together, so don\u2019t hope for a exercising swim there. However staff overall was quite good. I needed the internet in my room and they had a package which had free internet at the rate we took (200Sing $ per night per room). They gave me an ethernet cable to plug my laptop into but this was broken and so kept disconnecting and after asking for a replacement after rummaging through the wires they gave me another one in the same condition. And in any case the internet connection was not great and kept dropping off and sometimes I couldn\u2019t even get logged in. Well so much for the \u201cfree internet.\u201d As someone mentioned yes it is difficult to get a taxi here so it helps sometimes to get the hotel to ring for one earlier on. Its about a 5-15 min walk (depending on how fast you walk \uf04a) to get to the Bugis market where there are food courts and shops to look around and shop and also the Bugis Station Mall for more better quality stuff and some good restaurants. So overall a well placed hotel which is a great place to stay but not to eat in.

I banked on the last 2 positive reviews and just hoped for the best. I booked the newly renovated executive room and I wasn't disppointed. The rooms were a bit tiny especially that we had an extra bed, otherwise, i think it would have just been okay. It's got modern furnishing, flat screen TV, comfortable beds and modern finishings in the T&B. the not so good points are: the sliding door to the T&B can be quite difficult to maneuver and many times it got stuck, so we had to contend with taking a shower with the door open. The bathtub didn't have those non-slid stickers and it was quite dangerous to move around, I had to keep on holding on to the shower handle. If you have a child, then you better check this out. The retractable clotheline was a bit located halfway such that if you have it pulled out and u wanna rush to the tub, you might easily get caught up in it, dangerous as well! In the time that we were there, our rooms weren't at all made up each time we got back to the hotel at around 5pm. We had to call the attention of the front desk to make sure our rooms were made up by the time we're back for the night. There was no complimentary bottled water, and I think this was at least basic especially if you have coffee-making facilities. The staff did tell me that it was okay to use tap water, but I guess sometimes, we are wary on drinking tap water. As some poster has said, the biggest disappointment was really the breakfast. It was so bland, not too many choices and just so not appetizing. The \"free breakfast\" in the package seemed not to have mattered at all. I suggest you go somewhere and have your breakfast, there's kopitiam two blocks down. The hotel is located along a small street and we found it a bit difficult to get a taxi, especially in the early morning. I never had this problem in my previous stays in Singapore in other hotels. The front desk staff wasn't too helpful at all. He never helped us carry our bags nor did he offer to call a cab for us. He simply said it was difficult to get a cab from the hotel. And when I asked why, he just shrugged me off and said \"i don't know\". Over-all, if these points don't matter that much to you, the hotel is a good place to sleep (just make sure u get the newly-renovated rooms). Be sure to don't expect much from the breakfast nor from the staff.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Japan", "Title": "\u201cGood location but...\u201d", "Author": "Kento-san", "ReviewID": "UR20383887", "Content": "My family and I stayed at this hotel for 1 night while we were in Singapore.
