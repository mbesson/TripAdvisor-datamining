This is a small hotel but beautifully presented. The staff were extremely pleasant and very helpful. The rooms are typically Parisien but ours was ideal (room 34) overlooking the Opera House - if you had the balcony door open you could hear them practising - it was fanstastic. The breakfast is great too as it was included in the price - plenty of fresh fruit, yoghurt, cereal, ham, cheese, fresh bread, boiled eggs (hard or soft), fresh juice, coffee, tea etc. The lady who worked breakfast shift was very friendly and very helpful. Location of this hotel is ideal - within 3 minutes walk to the Bastille, very close to the nearest metro and everything very close. We took the open bus tour to see all of the sights from the Bastille on our first day and then took the metro/train to the Palace of Versailles on the second day - stopping off on the way back to some of the sights we had seen from the bus tour. A fanstastic city that doesn't have to cost a fortune if you eat/drink just of the main squares/streets. We found restaurants in the Latin quarter which were priced from 10 euros to 35 euros for 3 courses, however, if you want to spend more, there are plenty of places where you can spend your money.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ascot, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCan definitely recommend this hotel\u201d", "Author": "lizvincent", "ReviewID": "UR126829135", "Content": "Stayed here fo 4 nights.

Each one of them was not friendly at all. Unfortunately we had to leave our key with them each time we left and then pick it up when we came back into the hotel to get in our room. I kept hoping each time we did that....that at least one of them would be a little friendly....but not... On our first day I asked politely if I could have another pillow and the woman at the desk rolled her eyes and said something in French to the other woman standing there. Even though we were within very close walking distance to the metro..once on it... it felt like we had to take several trains each time just to get to the area where most of the sites were. We paid for breakfast each morning, but wish now that we hadn't. It was nothing to write home about...very basic. Our room was small but clean and the bathroom looked like it was fairly new. One night we were going to walk to a restaurant a couple of blocks away and realized when we got in the lobby that it was raining. We saw an umbrella stand with 5 or 6 umbrellas in it and asked the guy at the front desk if we could borrow one and he said no that we had to buy one. Needless to say we went back up to our room and got our own umbrella. On our last morning there we had to leave very early to get to the airport so I went down to the breakfast room to get some coffee for myself and my husband. Even though it was an hour or two before breakfast was to be available the coffee was already done....which probably explained why it tasted like mud on the other mornings. I was in the room maybe 10 seconds and the night desk clerk came hurrying in and said that I could not get the coffee...it wasn't time. But he said that there was coffee upstairs...in the lobby. I followed him up there and he showed me where I could get coffee but that I would have to pay for it. Seriously?? Even though we paid for the breakfast that morning, but were leaving before it started, we couldn't even get coffee from the breakfast room....we had to pay for the coffee in the lobby?? Needless to say we left without getting coffee. While in the lobby, I realized that there was a security camera for the breakfast room....I guess they thought you would steal some of the stale crossiants and awful coffee. They did have free internet on one computer down in the basement breakfast room. Of the 4 days we were there though, it only worked one day. All and all staying here kind of colored my stay in Paris in a not so great a light.

He's stayed in it before and is wonderful at finding affordable places to stay that have a little personality (or at least aren't some large, predictable chain) all over Europe. I had relatively easy, efficient communication with the hotel via email prior to my arrival when booking my stay and got the room at a good rate. There are a couple hotels on this little stretch of Rue de Lyon that are quite similar (small, boutique, and one has a name that's very similar to this one). It's a clean, pleasant place on the outside. The lobby is small, but clean, organized, and cheerful. When I arrived, I was a bit early and my room wasn't ready yet. The woman behind the desk took my suitcase and let me know when I could come back. And she helped me with some directions so I could run an errand or two in the meantime. When I came back, it was ready. My room was small (I didn't expect it not to be; it's France), but nicely appointed. There was plenty of room for me (and a guest one night when a friend came to visit) during what little time we spent in the room. There was a closet with a good amount of space, desk with chair (Unfortunately wifi isn't free), chair, and a nicely comfy bed. The room had central air (and heat, I suppose, but it was summer when I was there). The bathroom wasn't massive, but was again, what I expected. There was actually a bathtub (which isn't always the case). And I appreciated the heated towel rack. There was a nice, little view out into the hotel courtyard at the front (facing Rue de Lyon). The staff during the day was immensely helpful. They helped me find somewhere to buy a new mobile SIM card (and even helped me later top it up with my credit card since the directions/prompts were in French) and were generally great with any questions I had. The front door is locked at night, but someone is always sitting at the desk to let guests in. You can't beat the location of the hotel for the price, I think. It's right across from the stage door of the Bastille, steps from the Metro, a few more steps to the Marais, and walking distance to so much, really.

In fact, the contemporary interior design has been awarded for its excellence by \u201cHotel and Restaurant Design International.\u201d Across from the Opera Bastille, the hotel is a short walk from cinemas, terrace cafes, restaurants and shops. It is only 20 meters from the Bastille Metro, a five-minute walk from Gare de Lyon, and a few steps from the Marais area. Although not in the center of the city, it seemed to us a perfect situation for most anyone visiting Paris. The helpful and friendly day staff (Indunil and Zaia) always greeted us like welcomed friends and guests in someone\u2019s home. They provided us first-class personal service orienting us to Paris, offering sight-seeing and restaurant suggestions, aiding us in making arrangements for tours, giving directions and, in one instance, helping us by phone exchanges to reconnect with our tour van after being lost in a rainstorm for two hours in Versailles. The owner (Sylvie Glade---who lived in the States for two years) and staff we met all spoke fluent English including Indunil and Zaia. In B&B style, they brought us a small bottle of champagne to help celebrate my wife\u2019s 70th birthday and, when she was ill for one day, the owner herself graciously brought her a tray of tea and snacks.

My room - a twin for single occupancy, I just booked a single and this is what I got - was very comfortable and far more spacious than I'd been expecting after all I'd read about tiny Parisian rooms. Room #32 is directly above the courtyard, on the Rue de Lyon side. The double windows are Very Well soundproofed and open over a little balcony front - not a balcony, just a wrought-iron front, very cute. The bathroom was large and clean, with a shower over a nice deep bath. Great mirrors, both in the bathroom and along a whole wall in the bedroom. Just one full-length panel would have been good - ladies going to the opera need to know we look good de cap a pied - I had to stand on the bed to check! Nice little mini-bar, items the usual cost in hotels: \u20ac2 for small water, for example. Much cheaper to go to a supermarket of course but not outrageous. The room was very well cleaned every day. In fact, on departure I had to grope under the beds for my mobile phone - still not found it - and there were no dust bunnies at all. There is a safe in the room, and the general security felt good. The desk is attended 24/7, there is a sliding door operated from the desk, and the iron gate from the courtyard is locked at night. Small lift - but again, I've seen smaller. It says for 4 persons: probably not 4 of me buy hey. 2 with luggage, definitely. The hall lights go on instantly you get out of the lift or out of your bedroom. Breakfast was fine, a good enough choice, but ludicrously over-priced at \u20ac12. Pleasant wait-staff. My only problem was at checkout, which I chose to do the night before, as I had to leave early. The desk clerk did not know how to work the credit card machine, and, after first of all giving me the wrong price, then said I had to go out and get the cash from a machine. 'Where from?' I asked. 'I don't know. There are many in the city.' As it was now late and pitch black, I declined. Fortunately a senior staff member on her time off looked in and sorted everything in 3 minutes. To give her her due, she had wondered whether he'd be able to manage, being new, and had left what she felt were thorough instructions but it could have been a very nasty end to a great stay, if I'd been forced out to hunt the dark Bastille streets for a cash-point. Even worse if I'd waited until departure, I'd certainly have missed my flight. So, staff-training issues. However, these things happen, and although worth pointing out, did not diminish my enjoyment of my stay. I have already indicated to the hotel that I will be returning in March, and will again and again. The location is very good indeed - 90 seconds walk from a very good metro station, plenty of cafes and restaurants around of a kind that are used to dealing with international visitors but are not tourist dens. Ideal for the opera. (Opera Bastille). Close to L'Open Tour pick up/drop off points. The area is good and bustling, so that if you are out late at night, it does not feel creepy or threatening. I was perfectly happy as a solo female. I read people wanting accommodation 'near The Sights' - but some of the streets near 'The Sights' have such dreadful tourist-tatt shops in; the Bastille area does not feel like that at all. At the price point,\u20ac135 per room per night, which is kind of my max. I wouldn't think of looking anywhere else, will happily recommend, will happily return.

I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Love to Travel 50", "ReviewID": "UR17161923", "Content": "We arrived at the Pavillon Bastille late in the evening after travelling almost 24 hours, and this may be why the first night we were already making plans to look for a different hotel for the remainder of our stay. But the next morning, although the rooms are very small compared to what you get in the US for the amount of money you pay, the room did not look that bad. It was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom, also small, was very clean as well. The staff was great. They provided us maps and directions for either the subway or the metro to where we wanted to go every mornig whe we asked. Compared to the room our friends stayed at for about $100.00 more a night at another hotel, we really had a great room. Plus, we didn't spend very much time in our room either, we went to Paris to sight see, not to sleep. I would definitely go back. We didn't eat breakfast there because for the price, you could certainly eat somewhere else for less and get a better breakfast. The elevator is very small. We had to make 2 trips seperately to take everything up. The lobby is very small also. Quite frankly, everything is very small, but again it's Paris, and rooms are bound to be small unless you are going to want to spend a fortune for a room. Overall, we were glad we did not look for another hotel, It was near lots of places to eat, and near where we could take the metro and the subway. It was very clean and the staff and the owner were all very nice. We would love to stay again. A good tip though.. if you need a taxi, just flag one down outside because if you have the hotel call one for you, the taxi will charge you about 10 Euros for the reservation.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDesapointing\u201d", "Author": "Gary58", "ReviewID": "UR14126740", "Content": "Extremely desapointing for a 3 Stars : small rooms very noisy.

Although the room was somewhat small, it was totally sufficient for our needs. It is very well located by the Bastille, and close in particular to the Marais.
