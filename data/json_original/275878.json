This hotel is dire. My wife and I only continued to stay here because it became a laugh after a while at just how bad things could get! The hotel 'entrance' is basically a dark, dirty, bottom of a lift shaft with an old wire-cage lift in front of you. There's no reception at all down at street level. The lift wasn't working properly and didn't come to the ground floor so I had to drag the suitcase up to the second floor. There's seems to be around 6 floors to the 'complex' and is very poorly signed (like most of Rome in fact) so it took a few phone calls and lift rides to find the 'entrance' on the 3rd floor. There IS a reception on the 3rd floor and the lady was nice enough but the room was very small/no flat surfaces to put things on/no TV remote/no towells. There was no hot water from the shower at any time for 4 mornings except briefly on the day we were leaving and the shower door fell off. The breakfast room is tiny and the one working appliance, the toaster, broke on the second morning. I don't think they'll be replacing it in a hurry. In conclusion, this is the worst hotel I've stayed at EVER, in ANY country. Avoid at all costs unless you like a good laugh as well!", "Date": "March 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada", "Title": "\u201cQuality is poorer than expected\u201d", "Author": "lwx", "ReviewID": "UR3428453", "Content": "Our two families (4 adults and 4 kids) stayed in this hotel for 4 nights before the Easter long wekend and found the quality of this hotel is worse than what we expected. First of all, renovation was going on at the time when we stayed there and created a very noisy and dusty environment. The only positive thing that I can think of for this hotel is its location: safe neighborhood and close to the Main Train Station (about 15 minutes by walking) and the subway. Withinin the same old building, there are other B&Bs on the 2nd floor and other floors. Based on my observation, these hotels seem to be in a better shape than Hemingway Town Suites.", "Date": "April 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cWorst deal in Italy\u201d", "Author": "misela", "ReviewID": "UR3309784", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here during a 3 day stay in Rome while on our honeymoon. I had requested a quiet room, and the woman who had checked us in told me it was one of the better rooms, away from the noise. First, it was on the 6th floor (Hemingway office is on the third), they have only one small lift which was being used by construction workers the whole time. Our room was away from the street, but the window opened up to a large 'airshaft' where everyone's window is open and you could hear everyone's conversation. Because our room was so hot, and there was no way to control the heat, we HAD to keep the window open! (Not that this is the hotel's fault, but there is also a slew a pigeons who would wake us up every morning at 5 am) The room was super tiny, the walls were paper thin, and we were only given one towel and one tiny bar of soap each morning for two people. The breakfast room was a joke, they have five tables crammed into probably an 8'x8' space, so if there's more than 4 people in there, you're literally eating on top of someone. This was my first trip to Rome, so I'm not sure if I could've found a better place for the same amount of money. But for all the places we stayed in Italy, this was the worst for value and comfort.", "Date": "March 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, New York", "Title": "\u201cThink Twice Before Making a Reservation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2950695", "Content": "If anyone is considering making a reservation at this hotel, think twice. I made the rooky mistake of checking availability with this hotel and giving them my credit card number. Their website was clear that there would be no charge for making the inquiry. After making my inquiry, I never received a response. I then went on to book a stay at another hotel. Imagine my surprise when a month after my trip, there was a charge for $170 on my credit card for the Hemingway Town Suites! I contacted my credit card company to dispute the charge. They told me that Hemingway provided them with a copy of my e-mail asking about availability with another file that I never received stating they were confirming my reservation. When I never showed at the hotel, they charged me for a \"no show\". I just want travelers to know that I think their way of doing business is deceitful and with so many other alternatives to choose from, why stay at the Hemingway Town Suites. Also, I did try contacting the staff at this hotel about my situation and my e-mail was ignored.", "Date": "December 28, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hemingway Town Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d275878-Reviews-Hemingway_Town_Suites-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$95 - $171*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Flavia 84</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "275878", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e2/8d/e28d31e911a3955254fc49843f3bc53a1large.jpg"}}
