They are very helpful and flexible on any request. Very cheap prices and the location is amazing. Just two blocks from el zocalo, the national palace, half a block from el metro and walking distance to bellas artes. The rooms are very small but are comfortable. It doesn't have an AC and thus the room can get a lol hot but the fan helps a little. The rooms are clean and decorated in a simple yet very modern way. Truly recommend this place.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA great little hotel\u201d", "Author": "TeacherOnTheMove", "ReviewID": "UR68770657", "Content": "No frills! Tiny bath and a comfortable bed with a window you can open for air. For under $25 USD/night, this is a real steal. You're just a few blocks from the Zocalo, and even closer to the Zocalo's metro station which will zip you to the Zona Rosa or other parts of Mexico City. It's not noisy at all, and still very accessible by taxi (you're also just a few blocks away from a grocery store, department stores, and restaurants). Why overspend on your hotel?
