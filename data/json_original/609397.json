What's most important, especially when the weather is not good, there are radiators in the rooms which were still working in April.

The location is conveniently superb (spot on Gran Via - Callao), as there isn't any reason to stay in the room, really, they're just bed against walls, which actually nails its purpose. What was not so nice was the persistent sickening smell of food during the entire day at the lobby; luckily nothing found its way to the rooms. These were overly simple, but the bathrooms were spacious and clean! The doors weren't too think so steps could be heard from the other side, but rarely was there movement in the night. There was free internet, which is a major bonus. Good if you're looking for a cheap place to just sleep for a few day and want to be over the Gran Via.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for visiting Madrid, central, cheap and clean\u201d", "Author": "LynnBeeston", "ReviewID": "UR48363090", "Content": "This hostal is run by friendly staff, although on the 5th floor there is a lift. We travelled as a group of 5 mature ladies, and both rooms were perfectly acceptable, and extremely clean. Reception staff spoke English and Salvatore was most informative with good recommendations for dinner. As this is right on the main street ( a six lane road) it is advisable to ask for a room at the back, if you are an early bedder. We found everywhere within reasonable walking distance, but I recommend the bus trip for its commentary.
