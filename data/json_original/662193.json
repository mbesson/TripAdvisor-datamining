I first had a single room, which was just too small for my week long stay. I upgraded to a larger room, that later somehow never showed up on my final bill. Score! Truthfully, my biggest complaint was how uncomfortable the bed was. I had to ask the front desk (several times, too) for extra bedding so that I could cushion the mattress for more comfort. They are sort of front desk nazis about asking for extras. They kind of looked at me like I was hosting 10 extra people in my room althought I wasn't. And the pillows? What's up with the pillows? Their standard bed pillows are small and square. As in like couch or chair cushions. They were AWFUL to try to rest or sleep on. AWFUL. I begged for regular, normal bed pillows, but was advised the small square ones were the only ones they had. Ive travelled all over the place and have never not seen regular bed pillows used. The white and red pillows you see in the hotel's photos are what you get. Needless to say I had a very, very, very rough time trying to get comfortable in my room's bed. Spent a week sleepless in AMS. Other than that, I thought it was a good, safe hotel. They have to buzz you in after hours. The breakfast was what I expected... mainly its cold cuts and breads.

Our room was very satisfying. It was more spacious than we expected. Bathroom is a little small; but it was OK too. The only complaint would be about the breakfast. Not very much choices of, surprisingly cheese, and the coffee was bad. Nevertheless, there was a promotion price for the breakfast (9,95\u00e2\u201a\u00ac) so it was OK, I guess. Just one last and important note: although we have prepaid the entire stay through the Best Western website, we had to pay the City Tax (about 8\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for 2 days) upon check out.

So the standards rooms are small. Once you push the door to the right, taking one big step takes you to the tiny toilet on the left. Two more steps, you have the desk on the right handside, and one more step takes you to the bed. If you're staying in a double bedroom on your own, great. But walking around to the other side of the bed is going to be tricky - so my friend had to climb up the bed from the other side of the bed. Anyway. There is a nicely positioned TV installed on the wall, which was good. Towels were nice and clean, the bed was comfortable, shower was more like a 'wet room', so once you turn the tap on, the water will be pretty much everywhere. Plenty of hot water though. Also, Dove Shower Cream and Dove Shampoo were great. I regret brining my own stuff. We got fresh towels every day, which was good. Airconditioner goes up to 28 degrees, which was good enough. (It was around -14 outside, and we didn't fee a thing! So you probably won't feel cold). That's all I can say about the room. The hotel itself is in a perfect location for everything. Especially if you go for the Iamsterdam City Card - which gives you free pass to loads and loads of museums and public transport, you can take trams 2 or 5, and you'll be at Dam Square or Central Station within minutes. If you want to walk, it'll only take around 20 minutes or something - great walk on a sunny day. The hotel itself is really close to some of the museums - 1 minute away from the Rijksmuseum and 5-7 to Van Gogh museum. Lots of cafes and restaurants around. Seemed quite safe, even very late at night. Breakfast. Two words. Don't bother. OK, in Amsterdam it's difficult to find a place where you can have breakfast for less than a tenner, but at least you get what you really want. At the hotel, what you get for 10-12 (cheaper if you book it in advance, 12 if you don't) is: Slices of cake (raisin, etc.), croissant, butter, jam, sliced bread (no toaster, unfortunately, so cold bread), cold boiled egg (I got up at 9, surely they were warm at some point..), cheese slices (one or two kinds), ham-salami (2-3 kinds), some kind of chocolatey-pastry. Two kinds of cereals: 1- Kelloggs Corn Flakes 2- Fruity (the purple package - you know the one...) with cold milk and strawberry yoghurt. Concentrated orange juice, and coffee. All in all, it wasn't a disaster, but I'd rather get a pancake or something more local elsewhere. Mind you though, in Amsterdam coffee - plain, black coffee - is very expensive, and you get them in double espresso sizes - for 4-6 euros. No idea why, but it's a plus for the hotel breakfast if you fancy 3-4 cups of it in the morning like me! I stayed at Apollo for 4 nights, and I can't complain about it really. Rooms are tiny, so what. They were clean and comfortable and practical. Just once I heard the cleaner ladies in the hall hoovering the carpets at 8am which woke me up, but I guess it's my fault for being so lazy - or hungover :) That's all from me.

According to him we were the only people to go in our room that day. (So 300 euros had got up and walked away!!) After spending far too much time in the reception already for a 2 day trip, we were told in not so many words that even if someone had been seen going in our room - we wouldn't get any money back!

Ok look, breakfast cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac12.50 (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 if booked in advance), there was no restaurant which served lunch or dinner, and I had read on Trip Advisor that the minibars in the rooms were usually empty. So what on earth could I possibly spend \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 per day on in that hotel?! I explained that I had only brought a Visa debit card and that the deposit would come out of my account immediately, and would take 7-10 days to be refunded AFTER checkout. In the end, I was allowed to go to my room on the proviso that I appear at reception the next morning with \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 in cash. Fair enough, but I was tired, hungry and sweaty and really did not need such a long discussion at 2.30 in the morning! Next morning, there was a really nice receptionist called Anna on the desk - a whole different attitude and much more willing to find a compromise. The deposit was duly paid and, on mentioning that I hadn't slept all night due to people chatting and smoking right outside my room down in the basement, Anna immediately found me another room, still in the basement, but quieter and actually slightly larger, with 2 windows, so that at least there was some light coming in. She also arranged for me to receive breakfast ar the pre-booked rate of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10, so THANK YOU ANNA!! The rest of my stay was very enjoyable. Breakfast consisted of different types of bread, croussants, meats, cheeses, preserves, yoghurt, cereals, tea, coffee and fruit juices - perfectly adequate.

Shower was modern, with good water pressure, basic toiletries provided. The hotel was right beside Museum Quarter, so for location it was unbeatable! Plenty of restaurants nearby - try Srikandi, an Indonesian restaurant right round the corner, great food and service in authentic surroundings.

Perhaps Apollo Museum Hotel has cleaned up its act since then) with plenty of modern granite, chrome and clean textiles. The bathroom was lovely and I didn't find i had any of the previously mentioned problems with the shower getting the place wet. The shower was very good and could keep a nice temperature. I had a bath twice while i was there and it was lovely. (Can you tell I'm a toilet person?) We also didn't have much problem with the frosted glass toilet doors. It's true that you don't get much privacy - you can see into the toilet. However, if you're a couple then that shouldn't really matter too much. I only seen one bug when i was there, and it looked like it might have come in the window, which was open anyway, so I think the hotel must have sorted it's ant problem out too. The room had air conditioning which you could control from your room. The hotel kindly provide you with plug converters, toothbrush/toothpaste, shampoo/conditioner combo, hand creme and shower gel (all Dove brand) and there's a few extras you can get from reception which are all detailed in the handbook in your room. I can't comment on the mini-bar, breakfast or function suites as we did not use them. Cons: The staff were pretty rude and blunt at times. On the first night we went out to ask for a converter for the wall socket and the guy at the desk was pretty out of line with us. He commented that it's always the \"English\" who don't bring their converters. We corrected him that we are Scottish and he replied that we were all the same (!!!!) anyway. So from then on we were very uncomfortable around the staff as we were under the impression that we were not high enough on the class scale for them (as i mentioned, we got the hotel on cheap - we would not have been able to afford it otherwise and i think that they held that against us a little). Another point I'd like to bring up here is that if the hotel is offering services such as converters, they should not mock people for needing them. Another problem i had was with the intercom at night. The hotel locks the main door at night and you have to bell the front desk and they ask you your name and room number. This would be fine if any of the staff had any compassion or manners. They leave you standing there for ages while they finish what they're doing (you can blatantly see them through the door ignoring you) and then they come to the intercom. On more than one occasion they seemed disbelieving of us when we were trying to get in. They were often blunt and asked you to repeat your name and room number many times - even though they can see you through the door and know that you have a room with them. In the mornings, the housekeeping calls in at like 9 am. LOCK YOUR BEDROOM DOOR AND USE THE \"DO NOT DISTURB\" SIGNS. Otherwise, in your sleepy haze, you won't hear the cleaner calling in or knocking - then they barge straight in on your naked sleeping self. Not pleasant. This may well have been my own mistake on the first night for not using our signs, but it was a pain in the neck. Sometimes the cleaner would just keep knocking the door until you answered and told them to go away. The bed was okay. The mattress was new and thick, but the pillows were pitiful. We only got one each and it wasn't the regular size of a pillow and was thin. I would have asked for a new one, but the reception were so cold to us that i just coped. The hotel did not tell us about the 150 euros deposit we should have to pay prior to our checking in. Apparently it's to cover the cost of the minibar etc, but i advise that of you don't have a credit card then pay with cash. Apparently on a debit card the 150 euros will be held by the bank for a month (The woman at reception did actually inform us of all this, i was not robbed). I paid with cash and we didn't use any of the other facilities, so i got ALMOST all of it back. Apart from city tax. Which they did not tell us anything about until they deducted it at the end - this was pretty low quality service. I wasn't bothered about paying tax - everyone should anyway - but to be kept in the dark about it until it happens. Not good. The Wi-Fi did not have adequate coverage to our room and we were right next to reception. Even with the air con on, it was very cold at night and the duvets did not cover both me and my boyfriend very well. Summary: So all in all, it was a nice hotel to stay at. The staff were pretty poor, though. The woman who checked us in was nice and helpful, but the man with the glasses was the racist one whom was cold and uninterested towards us. The other staff were all just pretty indifferent and uncaring. My advice is that if you get this place on the cheap, then do get it. Definitely. The room was lovely and the location is brilliant. Just don't expect the staff to be very hospitable.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cThe only place to stay to see the Museums\u201d", "Author": "Kiwis_overseas", "ReviewID": "UR122239333", "Content": "Smaller room but a lovely shower, clean and tidy.

Last year it was a nightmare with the shower because the water would just spill out all over the floor and onto the carpet of the actual room. This time it was much better. Only once did the cleaning staff forget to leave us towels. But a call to the front desk and a few minutes later we had towels. Breakfast was included in our package and it served us well.

Only one receptionist had the courtesy to great us with a brief \"good night\" upon entering the hotel. The staff needs training, for sure. Also, dont forget to put out the \"do not disturb\"-sign, if you don't want housekeeping to enter at around 9AM. We booked this hotel at a bargain rate, so we were okay with staying there.

First impressions of the hotel were good, nice building, nice location, two minutes from the tram stop and modern lobby. Check-in time is 2pm and we arrived bang on time, however there was only one person on reception checking a lot of people in. We waited until about half 2 to finally check-in and were told (after a few minutes of being blatantly ignored) that our room was still not ready as the hotel was 'fully booked'. Waited until three to finally get our room and we were disgusted by it. It was beyond tiny, as soon as you open the door you smack it against a clothes rail, which had to be placed that close to the door as there was virtually no floor space in the room. There was about a foot of space around the bed, with a tiny window overlooking the back of another building. Our double bed was also not a double bed, but two singles pushed together. However the worst thing about the room was the walls. The supposedly white walls were covered in black marks from suitcases, shoes etc. Even the wall above the bed was filthy. It was disgusting. We stayed about five minutes then went back down to complain. The girl on reception was quite nice and changed our room immediately (fully booked?). Our new room was not in the main hotel building but in a separate apartment building beside it. She assured us that it would be nice and quieter in this building. This room was much bigger and much cleaner with huge windows. However it was on the ground floor and the windows did nothing to keep out the noise from the rather busy street outside. The double bed was again two singles pushed together, which would have been ok had they not been made up separately, not exactly nice when you get stuck in the gap between the beds and have to sleep beneath separate single duvets! The pillows were also tiny, and very high, resulting in a terrible crick in the neck! This all combined to give me a terrible night's sleep every night! Another room's bathroom also backed onto ours and so the noise from the flush would be enough to wake anyone up. We were also beside the main door into the building which was noisy when people were coming in and out. The bathroom was ok, wasn't a fan of the glass door, or the fact that the shower practically flooded the little room, making the tiles a deathtrap if you didn't put a towel down. Our room had a minibar however it was empty. There was also no room service provided by the hotel, at least not to our room, and when my other half went to the main reception to inquire about it (at about 12) he found the front doors locked, and received no answer to the bell. We didn't get breakfast so can't comment on it, and spent little time in the main hotel building unless we had to, however the staff on check-out were helpful and polite and we were allowed store our bags for the day too. The best part of the hotel is undoubtedly the location, on a high-end shopping street, 5 minutes from the main museum district, 5 minutes from Leidesplein (full of bars and restaurants), 15 minutes walk to the Anne Frank museum, 20 minutes (max) to the Red-Light District.

Telling me that they needed more people reporting a problem although, he said, most people with Apple products had complained of not being able to log on (???). I guess there were not enough Apple users including myself to have this gentlemen try to restart the router.... We get to our room which smells disgustingly like mold. Another minor detail, our hotel window faced a large wooden panel - super depressing. Fortunately, thanks to another review, we had been warned that the shower leaks out from under the useless glass door, which does not even come close to holding out any water from running out onto the floor of the bathroom. We put a towel here when we showered. The first night/morning we are awoken by an alarm at 3am. My boyfriend and I are unsure whether it's a fire alarm and open our door and see nothing nor here any movements from others. We fall back asleep. I ask the person at the front desk the next morning whether it was, in fact, a fire alarm and she nonchalantly answers \"yes.\" I inform her that the protocol in US hotels is quite different, and the louder alarms remind everyone to evacuate their rooms- she replies \"well we expected you to come out and gather by the lobby.\" I don't even know what to say. The people at the front desk seriously could care less about us. Lastly, upon returning home, I realize I've been charged an additional fee outside the $560+ USD I dropped for three nights. I've been charged an additional $43 USD (not including the currency convergence charge). I call the hotel, and explain to them that THEY had explained to me all my charges on ONE, single, bill that I thought had already been paid (including a short phone call I had made from the room). They say that my rooms were paid separately, by another authorization number, and that the additional fees (17EUROS for a \"tourist tax\") and my phone call were charged separately. Why not explain this on check out? I have now had to pay TWO separate currency convergence fees!!! Dealing with this hotel AGAIN when I got home was incredibly infuriating and when I tried to explain what I had thought was the way I would be charged to the man at the front desk of the Best Western Apollo MuseumHotel Amsterdam City Center HUNG UP ON ME.

Also, the internet was horrendous for the most part, so I wouldn't stay here for a long-term stay. And the biggest problem that we had was that our room was FREEZING! Our room was located underground on the -1 floor, it was under freezing temperatures outside, and the heat did not work. While the staff provided us extra blankets and gave us a stand-alone heater, we did not pay 280 to freeze for two nights. They said they would check on it the first night, but the problem in our room was not resolved by the time we left. This is the reason why I gave it a 3/5. Now, the good. Since the couple shared a double bed and I had a separate bed, the room was very spacious. The hotel was very nice and very cheap considering the location of the hotel. As soon as we walked out the door, the Hard Rock Cafe was literally across the street, along with clubs, museums, and a 24/7 spot to eat. Prime location for tourists (which I was).

The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to two trams around the corner (the 2 and the 5 which both come and go to Centraal Station). Surprisingly there is no ramp to go into the hotel. Rather you have to climb about 10 steps with your luggage into the hotel. We were immediately able to check in. They asked for a credit card to keep on file (which I thought was weird because the room was paid for). Nevertheless they made a \"copy\" of it (more about this later - it's not bad I promise). We were on the 4th floor and the elevator is big enough to fit two people with two 25\" inch suitcases and a few stragglers. To comment about the smell that the reviewer below mentioned - I think it was from the carpet. There was a mildew-y musk in the hallways that is certainly not refreshing but I think it stemmed from all the wet shoes coming in and out of the hotel (It had unseasonably been snowing for the past few days). That said our room did not smell at all. If anything they sprayed something to make the room smell fresh upon entering. The room is small! A lot of reviewers have mentioned that and it's very small! We kept our suitcases by the door and we had to squeeze to get in. I can't imagine two large size people comfortably staying in this room. However, if you plan on just using the room to sleep at night then you should be just fine. The bathroom - while it looks pretty it's not exactly functional. The sink is pretty, but ours didn't drain very fast because the water would stay around for a while. Not a big deal - we stuck the end of our toothpaste tube under the drain (if that's what you call it) and the water went down a lot faster. We left it like that for housekeeping to see and they fixed it. They include large size Dove shampoo/conditioner and body wash in the shower and by the sink. The shower isn't very functional as well. If you take a long shower - good luck. The way the shower is installed it's on the same level as the sink and toilet. There's no step into the shower. So if the water doesn't drain right away it leaks out into the bathroom. After each shower we would use over towels to mop up the floor. It wasn't that big of a deal when given we had hot water and good water (not hard, not soft). It was kind of cold in the room and we couldn't figure out if the heating was on. But from reading the previous review it seemed there was a hotel wide issue. We put on the highest temperature we could but it was still cold. Not a big deal when we went under the covers - which honestly was weird that there was only a comforter and not a blanket. Usually in hotels there's a decorative blanket/quilt, a textured blanket and another linen. Here there was only the comforter, but I have to say was cozy and warm. The bed has a foam bed then the mattress so you kind of sink into it. But it was comfortable. I must say I did fall asleep fast. Our room was in the back so no issues with noise. I did notice there's a fifth floor and it's stairs only access - so good luck if you have heavy luggage. Breakfast was included in our package. And it was good - there were croissants, rolls, toast, apples, and oranges, cold meats ham, turkey, salami), cheeses, cereals, yogurts, coffee, hot chocolate, juices, etc. After you sit down you get asked to fill out a form with your name and room info - I guess for either stats or to see if breakfast is included in your package. Onto the credit card - there's free wifi in the hotel which is a plus. I saw two computers hooked up to a printer for guest use which is always nice. Since it was the end of the trip I wanted to make catch up on bills and banking. I noticed there was a charge for the hotel (about 130USD). I wondered for what since the room was paid for and it couldn't have been a deposit. \"Oh no it was that stupid sink!\" I thought. When we checked out I asked about it and they said it's just security measure/deposit, but that it would be credited back to my account. It wasn't a big deal as I had enough in my checking and several days later the charge disappeared and all was well in my checking account. I would recommend if you're checking into the hotel to make sure you have enough money in your account for their \"charge\". Because it would be terrible if you were \"charged\" and you didn't have enough money and you were given an over charge penalty. All in all, yes it was small, but the room was clean and tidy and in a great location. You're about a 10-15 minute walk to Leidesplein and about a 40-60 minute walk to the Anne Frank House.

If you dare stay here, you will be walking distance from Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum -- two \"must sees\" while in Amsterdam. The hotel is also walking distance from several public transportation stops. 2. The hotel was clean. CONS 1. My room (for two) was so small it was ridiculous! When I walked approximately two feet from the door, I ran into the bed. Please note I am not exaggerating. Further, to get a medium sized piece of luggage to the twin bed near the window, you need to lift the luggage over the bed. The floor space is inefficient to pull your luggage around the bed. 2. The designer of the hotel's bathroom clearly never used it! While granite floors are aesthetically pleasing, they are also incredibly slippery. Additionally, the shower floors did not slope toward they drain nor did they have a barrier so that water would stay in the shower. Therefore, after a 5-10 minute shower, water was all over the (slippery granite) floor. 3. The hotel does not have a full restaurant. It does offer a buffet restaurant with a mediocre selection. 4. During our last night, we did not have heat! Mind you, during our stay, Western Europe experienced record low temperatures for November; so indoor heat was crucial. When we reported there was a heating problem, the front desk's response was, \"There is nothing I can do.

It is located off of a very high-end shopping district and rather close ton Vondelpark. The lobby is also very nice - quite modern and welcoming, with computer stations. However, the rooms are anything but that. At least the room that we had. The decor is a mere afterthought. It was very clinical. Plain white walls with no artwork of any kind. The room is also very very small. Just to get to my side of bed I had to practically squeeze my way through the wall and the bed. Perhaps most of hotels are small at this price point, but I can't say as this was my first visit to Amsterdam.

However this hotel was the worst we stayed in during our travels, which was surprising considering we stayed in Paris, which is renowned for its miniture rooms. One thing which the hotel fail to mention is that they do not accept Maestro cards. As we did not have a credit card we had to pay up front and also give a cash deposit of fifty euro for every night we were staying. Seeing as how this was the last leg of our travels, money was tight. Had I of known this prior to our arrival I could have budgeted for this. The staff were unhelpful and seemed only to smile when there was money involved. The room was like a cell complete with two tiny windows and and a bathroom with a toilet facing a frosted door. The cleanliness of the room was not ideal and there was a terrible smell in the bathroom from prior guests who obviously were not sufficently cleaned up after. It was difficult navigating the tiny bathroom alone especially after a shower when it flooded. It was also hard to enquire about anything at reception as there was usually a que of dissatisfied guests every time you went to reception. Needless to say the atmosphere was not inviting. The only positive about the hotel is its location, however, when you are faced with torrential rain and wind, which we were, you find yourself wishing you had a room you could bear to stay in.

Hooftstraat and Stadhouderkade. The reception is bright and spacious, so is the restaurant. Our Classic double room on second floor had two very comfortable single beds, a writing desk, air-conditioning and a wall-hung LCD-TV. The bathroom was impeccable and extremely clean with everything shining. The shower was great and brand new. I've noticed on various sites that there are rooms described as \"Economy rooms\", these are located on lower ground floor and are smaller than the Classic rooms. If you don't mind having a view only of peoples feet on the pavement outside this can be a budget choice. However, if you request more space and a nicer view I would definitely recommend you spend a few Euros extra and get a Classic room. At 17.95 Euros the breakfast seems a bit pricy. However, if you book your breakfast at the reception on the night before, you get a 5 Euro discount and pay only 12.95 Euro. That is actually priceworthy - the breakfast is buffet style and lacks nothing. You can eat as much as you like of eggs (boiled and fried), bacon, cereals, bread rolls, fruit juices, freshly made croissants, ham, cheese, fresh fruit and coffee or tea. The restaurant is open all day and quite nice to relax and enjoy a drink in while watching the boats on the canal outside the window. The only thing I can think of commenting on was the fact that it said that all Classic rooms have a mini bar. Ours didn't, but we never even bothered to ask why. Besides that very minor \"problem\" I consider Apollo Museum Hotel to be an excellent choice if you look for a clean and fresh hotel in the middle of everything. Leidseplein and numerous restaurants and bars are reached by a 5 min walk, Blue Boats departure (you must take a 75 min canal cruise) is just outside the hotel. The tram (#2 and 5 both go to the Centraal Station which takes about 7 mins) stops just around the corner on Hobbermaasstraat and takes 1 min to reach. The area is quiet and nice though it's close to everything. For those travelling with children: this is an area free from all kinds of sex shops - not to be forgotten. Last but not least - if you go to the left when you go out of the hotel, just around the corner there is an Indonesian restaurant called Srikandi. Try their Rijsttaffel, an Indonesian sm\u00c3\u00b6rg\u00c3\u00a5sbord which is marvellous. I have never met such polite and nice waiters before, and the food was delicious.

Words can't describe how disappointed we were with this hotel. Firstly we were given room 301. The worst hotel room I have ever stayed in, which had a sink in the bedroom as the bathroom was too small, mould through out the whole room and especially thick in the bathroom. Clearly the room had previously been broken into as the lock was broken. We then asked for another room which was also on the third floor, this room was marginally better (if that is possible) only to find a mouse in our room at 2:00am. This hotel is currently under renovation and only the first two floors out of the three have been completed. If you do want to stay here dont accept a room on the third floor. All I can say is DO NOT STAY HERE.

This is a hotel of two parts. I booked a \"classic\" double room which was only accessible by going outside from the lovely refurbished foyer and down the road to another entrance where the electric mains cable ran through the letterbox and the bags of dirty linen were dumped on the tatty carpet in the hallway. The room (405)was so small that there was no room either side of the bed. Along the wall near the window was growing black mould and because of the tightness of the bed to the wall, presumably they were unable to clean the dirt from the around the radiators. A wall light and desklight did not function. There was mould on the shower room ceiling (no bath) and after the first night the towels were not changed or the rubbish bin emptied! There didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any fire escapes and the only provision I saw was a fire hose on the wall and an escape route plan. (Not much help to those on the higher floors) Why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I ask to be moved? Because it was reasonably quiet in there (a priority) and the bed was comfortable. Other than that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how they can use the word \"classic\". They say you get what you pay for and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even get that. For a higher rate you can get a \"deluxe room\" which is accessible by lift and newly refurbished. The difference couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be more contrasting. I also booked a roundtrip airport shuttle with Connexion. Their airport desk instructed me to give my departure time to the Hotel reception who would ring them and arrange the return journey. No way! They wouldn't ring - they sent me down the Road to another Hotel (not related) who kindly rang and we arranged pickup from there.", "Date": "September 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "London.

The staff seem pleasant, although take proof of your booking, we were told that breakfast wasn't included for expedia guests, luckily our confirmation email said that it did. You do need to go along the road to a different hotel for excellent buffet style breakfast. We were given one of the refurbished rooms, just as pictured on the website, but perhaps using trick photography!! Quite possibly the smallest double room I've ever been in, you are able to walk round the bed, but there was only about a foot to spare at the bottom.

I arrived to absolute chaos. I honestly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind as I was out during the day. What I did mind was the additional fees/expenses that were suddenly added to my final bill. Let me elaborate. There was a sign prominently posted at the reception counter. It stated something to the effect that you were to obtain your \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breakfast voucher\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and take it to the Park Hotel and that they were very sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. What they neglected to state was this breakfast was NOT included in the price of your room and cost 15 euro/day. So in essence what might have been a good deal on a room went down the drain as I am sure the average couple could have found a hotel that included breakfast and had no construction for that additional 30 euro/day. If you still want to stay here, skip the park hotel breakfast and have a traditional English breakfast practically anywhere in town for about 5 euro. Otherwise I found the hotel to be of standard European fare. The room was a bit small and you could hear your neighbors as well as you could if they were in the same bed with you. It appears they are converting all the rooms to ensuite. In order to accomplish this they are adding 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 X 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (1.2 meters X 1.2 meters) bathrooms to each room. While it looks very euro-chic, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very practical for more than a day or two nor for more than one person.
