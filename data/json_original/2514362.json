Simple, clean, friendly staff etc is all you need for a good holiday and your not exactly going to be spending day and night in your room! Myself and a friend booked in for 7 nights in the Americanna Inn, on arrival it just looks like and apartment block. Inside its clean, simple and altogether all you need for a trip to the city. We where a bit dubious about the shared bathrooms, but with 10 rooms on each floor and 5 bathrooms we never had a problem with queing or them being dirty. Cleaners came into our rooms everyday and made our beds and did the floor etc, all very friendly. The staff on the desk are all lovely too and very helpful! The rooms themselves are big enough for 2, not huge but enough space with a sink, TV and wardrobe area, we had a/c in our room but I dont think they all do, ask if its warm as the rooms do get hot. If Im being picky, the only thing I would say was becuase our room was on the main road it was noisy during the night even though the windows are double glazed, but then you are in New York so its to be expected. The location is ideal, 2 blocks to the left is the Empire State Building and right next to 5th ave and Times Square. Also the deli just across the road (Bryant Market) is good if you want some cheap hot food.

I stayed in a single room which was very small but this was expected! However I had no problem fitting in a large suitcase + you have the cupboard space with hangers & rail. The flatscreen TV was also great. The rooms were a little too hot but better than being too cold. My room backed onto a building site which was extremely loud at 7am every morning which was a bit of a pain. Also the hotel is just that little bit too creaky/old so when the couple in a surrounding room is having a little fun it's very very loud for you....not so enjoyable!

Yes, bathrooms are shared, but there is one bathroom to every three rooms - it's either next door or just a step across the hall. We never once encountered the one next door occupied or needing to be cleaned, but there were more within 20 steps down the hall. Yes, the room has linoleum tile in the bedroom, but the room is clean. The blinds are a bit thrashed and didn't work in our room, so there was more light in there at night and early morning than we'd have liked. You have no control over the room temperature. You will need ear plugs to block out the street noise which continues all through the night. Yes, the room is small, but there is a sink and mirror in the room. There is a closet (but no hangers in ours), the pillow was a little too dense, and the bed is just ok. There was a collapsible luggage stand in the closet, a small bedstand with a phone, and a slim-line TV on the wall (we never even considered turning it on). We were there simply for a place to sleep that was conveniently close to the theater district. Did I mention that the place is clean? The idea of shared bathrooms made me nervous initially, but they were kept clean. The place looks and smells clean, and the staff is very friendly. There is no wi-fi in the rooms, but there is a computer with internet access in the lobby that is available for a fee. I managed to get wi-fi access in the lobby for my laptop.

We had to book the Americana whilst in New York, and were concious of budget having already spent money to stay in a hotel for one night after our previous hostel was shut down upon arrival. By this point in our trip we were not really bothered about what accomodation we got, we just wanted something that was reasonably priced and clean so we could rest our weary heads for a while. We decided upon the Americana, and we were NOT dissapointed!!! We arrived into a lovely cosy reception area, and were booked in efficiently. On getting in to our room, the first thing that struck us was how small is was, but the second thing that struck us was how CLEAN it was too. We Had a huge cupboard to put our massive back packs in, and a big sink in the corner with lovely clean towels and soaps underneath the sink. The room was noisy, but as a previous reviewer has said, I dont think anywhere in the city can really be that quiet, its a compromise we were prepared to make to be in a fantastic location.The beds were comfortable too, so depsite the noise, and after days full of walking the streets of New York, we didnt find it too difficult to fall asleep! In fact, the people in the room next to us kept us awake more than the hustle and bustle of the street outside. But dont let that put you off at all.....we felt safe and secure in the room we had. The bathrooms were also very clean, luckily we had one right across the hall from our room, so it was very conveinient, I did also see a large disabled bathroom too, which we used on the one occasion the other bathroom was busy. The cleaning staff do an excellent job of keeping the entire place clean, even the hallway floors are cleaned everyday. The location is EXCELLENT! We were not completely sure of the exact location when we were searching for hostels, but upon our arrival we soon realsied that Byrant park is just a 3 minute walk, (currently they have an amazing christmas market on there), Times Square is also very close, just a few blocks away (if that!) and Macy's and the Empire state are also within walking distance from the Inn. After a very bad start to our stay in New York, with our original hostel being shut down, the Americana Inn really did make the trip worthwhile. In fact, In a way we were pleased that the original hostel was closed down, as this place superseeded our expectations and was probably much better than our original accomodation anyway for not much of a difference in price! Highly reccomend, and we would definitely use this place again if we return to New York in the future.

I\u2019m a budget traveller and I chose this location for it\u2019s proximity to Bryant Park and was not disappointed, only a 2 minute walk to this little haven of peace in hectic New York. We were upgraded to a 3 bed room, which for this hotel means a pretty large room! I already posted other pictures earlier and yes, rooms can be pretty cramped. I\u2019m giving this hotel 5 stars, though, but that is keeping in mind it\u2019s only a one star hotel and we got a pretty good deal, booking it early on a slight discount, and got a wonderful upgrade as mentioned! Actually, after reading all the reviews I was surprised at the little street noise we experienced. Nothing spectacular, really. Sure, we both used earplugs, but that only drowns noise a little\u2026.guess we were both too tired, though I did spend 1 or 2 nights staying up late working on the pc. No internet in the rooms, as stated, but Bryant Park offers free wifi which is perfect as long as you sit in one of the corners. The park did close at 11 PM, to my surprise. Pillows were fine though not overly thick, beds a little squeaky, nice firm mattresses (which is how I like them). We experienced no noisy neighbours at all, but that\u2019s always a matter of luck, I think. No carpets, so no dirty stains, fine by me! Yes, the bathrooms could be damp, as there was no airing system\u2026but when I share bathrooms, I make a point of wearing flipflops at all times! They were clean, though, and water pressure and temperature was good. About 4 or 5 to each floor, only one with a window\u2026 As for the bedding, the linen was fresh and clean, the blankets thin and indeed had holes in them\u2026they did seem clean to me. There was a flatscreen tv, but we never had in on, so I can\u2019t comment on that. We could actually get on to the fire escape, which we did once to have some tea and it was great fun! Luckily, we also had a functioning airco, as the outside temperature was well in it\u2019s 80\u2019s! Boy, it was hot in NY that week! As one NY-er we got talking to said: \u2018you picked the worst weather ever to visit!\u2019 He was right, of course, but we still had a wonderful trip and the last 2 days the weather gods had some mercy on our souls\u2026 There is a small elevator, no fan or airco inside, so with these temperatures: a free sauna was included. It stops on the second floor at any time, so we opted to take the steps from that floor and back\u2026..I have to admit, not the fastest elevator I know\u2026.we sometimes took the stairs down not to get too hot\u2026but, as I mentioned, weather conditions were extreme! Fire plans, extinguishers, alarms, escapes, all seemed to be in perfect order. Every floor had one kitchen with a microwave, a cooking device and a fridge. No utensils. There is a lovely little deli across the street, run by Chinese, where you could get great stuff (warm food after 11 AM, I think) to take to the park and have breakfast or diner.

The location is superb, and the price is a fair bit cheaper than anything else in the area. The hotel is very clean (no bed-bugs!) and the communal bathrooms were also very clean and never busy. The bad: we booked two nights here, directly to the hotel. No agencies, no middlemen. And when we arrived, the hotel had NO record of us at all. This is why I always carry printed-out confirmations, and booking it directly meant they couldn't make the excuse that it was the agency's fault. No, it was entirely and completely their own. And we had the proof. They were also full, so after making us wait in the small and rather stuffy lobby for ages we were finally able to have a room. A single room, for two adult males. With a rollaway, there was literally only just enough room for the two beds, as the room was tiny. The desk clerk graciously permitted us to have this rollaway for NO extra charge! So generous! When it was their own fault in the first place that we were being squeezed into a shoebox! So in summary, while this hotel has several features to recommend it, it fails in one of the core aspects of running a hotel: keeping track of reservations (not even a discount as apology). It is about half the price of the Marriott brands across the street, but I would think very carefully about staying here. Oh, and while our room was nice and quiet, as it faced a brick wall, the air-con in the window made a huge racket. Next time I will choose the Marriott over the road if I want to stay in this part of New York. It's only about twice the price, and almost certainly twice as good.

It is less than 10 minutes walk from Penn Central station, and is very centrally located within New York City, only a few blocks from the Empire State Building. I stayed two nights in September. The hotel was very clean. The office (on the 2nd floor) offers guests use of a safety deposit box to store valuables. There is a payphone in the 2nd floor lobby, as well as a drink vending machine and a single computer with paid internet access (either credit card or cash). I was in a single room on the 5th floor, and there are a few things for prospective patrons to note to assist with their stay: * The hotel has vinyl floors, * The rooms do not have a coffee maker - but you are next door to Pret a Manger and there is also a great deli diagonally opposite, * With shared bathrooms I would suggest bringing thongs (flip flops). As other guests have noted the bathrooms are very clean. There were at least 4 bathrooms on my floor. Unlike several other reviewers, I did experience one occasion when three of the bathrooms were being used - I think everyone wanted to have a shower at the same time! * While a washbasin is provided in the room, there was nowhere to hang your towel (other than over the back of the chair), * There was no lamp in the room, with all the lights controlled by a switch at the door. I would therefore suggest bringing a torch, * While toiletries, towel and floormat are provided in your room for use in the shared bathroom. no facecloth was provided, * There is no desk provided in the room, but the chest of drawers can double as a desk if needed, * No iron or ironing board is provided in the room (I did not ask at the desk if one was available), * No guest information is provided in the rooms, and * The single lift can be very slow. I only used it to bring my luggage up to the 5th floor when arriving and back down when leaving and used the stairs for the rest of the time. The above items are not meant as criticisms and did not detract from my stay. As several other guests have noted downtown New York is noisy at night, but after all it is the city that never sleeps (except seemingly at 7:00am when going out to get breakfast). I did not find the airconditioner particularly noisy even though it was mounted right above the bed head - it probably made less noise than my wall mounted unit at home! The deli diagonally opposite made great bagels with cream cheese for breakfast. As noted above Pret a Manger is next door and adjacent to Pret a Manger is another deli. The souvenir shop around the corner (corner of 39th and 6th) sells stamps, and there is a post box right outside the shop. The internet booking price of $145 per night (plus taxes) was excellent value for money for central New York, and I would definitely stay here again if visiting New York.

I actually found the sound of cars driving by, car horns being tooted and the somewhat annoying sound of the shop across the road's high pitched advertising jingle all part of the experience of being in NYC. The room itself was tidy & a comfortable size. With the fantastic city all around you, I doubt you'll need a bigger room anyway. There were plenty of bathrooms on the floor; we were closest to the disabled. The bathroom was okay. It was cleaned each day, but there was something about it that you just wouldn't spend a long time in there. The city... What can I say about the city?

On our way out, we bumped into some other Aussies who were staying on our floor and they pointed us in the direction of TS. The Inn is also close to Bryant Park where we spent a few mornings eating breakfast & enjoying the cool breezes & watching the New Yorkers make their way to work. There's just so much to say about NY, I loved this city.

Just some helpful tips: The hotel is on the corner of 6th ave and 38th street, on 6th you will see a blue sign above a cafe on the corner with the hotel name, then turn the corner to 38th st and the hotel is just a couple doors down, with a green door, press the buzzer to enter. The lobby is one floor up, there is an elevator and stairs, I think there are about 5-6 floors. The lobby has a vending machine for drinks and a stand for pamphlets that have coupons for attractions in the city. We stayed on the 2nd floor, which if I were to do it again, I would ask for a room on a higher level and for a room with a view. The main floor just has too much commotion with cleaning staff and the elevator dinging at all hours. But there are about 15-20 rooms and 4 bathrooms per floor which was never a problem for us, I would suggest using your do not disturb sign when going into the washroom because people tend to try to open the door before knocking. The room itself was small for two people but it was enough for the price. There is a little closet with hangers, a desk, chair, sink, and mirror. The cleaning staff bring fresh towels every day and tidy the room. I would recommend bringing a wash cloth or loofah to help scrub off the layers of sweat from walking in the city. There is free cable in your room which is awesome. The walls are super thin so you can hear everyone walking around and the cleaning staff are really loud in the morning, try a higher floor and maybe it wouldn't be a problem. Overall the hotel was pretty nice, if you're looking for a place to keep your stuff and crash for the night, this hotel works. It is right near bryant park and times square, its within walking distance to central park, its a great location especially for the price. If you're on a budget but want to have fun exploring the city, I would recommend this hotel.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "miami", "Title": "\u201cGood bang for your buck!!\u201d", "Author": "colo77", "ReviewID": "UR52557239", "Content": "Tis hotel is well located, in the heart of new york, everything is close by,,,the rooms are average what you could expect for a budget hotel, but clean! service from the staff was very helpful, i stayed during the NYE so it was pretty busy but the staff always found time to help out, overall is well located is cheap but clean and the staff is helpfull.

The bedroom on the top floor had twin beds, a shared bedside table, a small closet with about 6 hangers in and a sink with a light on. My biggest gripe was NO mirror in the room which was a bit annoying with two girls getting ready every morning. Saying that though, the shared bathrooms were normally very clean (obviously when they had just been used they got a little mucky- but the maids were excellent and kept them clean every day!) It would have been nice to have paper towels to dry hands or soap to wash hands because you hardly remember to take a towel every time you go to the toilet. The shower wasn't very powerful and did stop randomly a couple of times - but did turn back on after a couple of minutes and was hot and fine. Also there were no worry about getting into the bathrooms because you could always nip to another floor you were stuck. Overall it was clean and basic. Little touches like paper hand towels in bathroom, and a mirror in the bedroom would have made it even better, but for the price you can't really complain. Asked for a hairdryer at reception every morning and got one and used a safety deposit box behind reception too which was fine. Lift was kinda HOT and a bit slow, and slightly annoying because it dinged a lot. Air con handy when we stayed because wass very warm but could not really leave it on all night because was very noisy. NYC is the kinda place which you expect beeping horns and trash being broken up in the night so just expect it and take it in as the city experience.

We had no creepy or weird experiences with the residents of this building but having residents in the same building as a hotel is something worth mentioning so people booking it are at least aware. The rooms are waaaaay smaller than the Pod Hotel which is a comparative price in the same neighborhood. The room is just barely big enough to fit the double bed in the room, a tiny dresser that you couldn't use if you wanted to due to it's proximity to the bed (to close to open the drawers). There is also a closet and small sink in the room. However, there is no mirror in the room making it difficult to apply makeup, or do your hair without going into the somewhat dirty shared bathrooms. The room could not have been bigger than 75 or 80 square feet. It was very difficult for two people to sleep and get ready in this room for two days. The bathrooms were not the worst shared bathrooms i have ever seen but they were not clean. There was other peoples hair all over them. There was also nothing to dry your hands on after washing them. The linens on the bed were clean enough to sleep on without fear and we did not see or feel any bedbugs so that was a plus, i guess. There is no wifi. The man working the front desk was flat out rude. the entire time.

Looked up hotels, found this one that was under $150 a night, parked my car two blocks away @ $25 for the night. I read the reviews and found that it was a bare minimum kind of hotel. You just get a small room, with shared bathroom, etc... The hotel reminded me more of a hostel, with doors and closets. I selected this hotel for the price, and because it was close to what I was in New York to do. The rooms are clean... too clean. Smelled a little like bleach. Bring ear plugs, or noise canceling head phones. The inn overlooks the intersection of 5th and 38th, and the city literally never sleeps. Very noisy. The A/C works, TV barely works. Who goes to NY to watch TV? I couldn't hear the TV over the noise from outside with the A/C on top of it. The shared bathroom isn't too appealing either, but you get what you pay for. Bring soap, and your own towel if you can. Maybe your own pillow too. Actually, you should probably stay across the street at the Marriott. About 5 blocks west, there's a Best Western. The Americana Inn is for non-fussy travelers. I was too tired and drunk to really care about my room for one night.

I would advise anyone going to NY to use this place, its well worth it. The lobby is on the second floor, and they have to buzz you in to enter. To use the lifts first it has to stop at the lobby, at first i was a bit confused by this, but i suppose its an added security measure to stop any would be thieves, nice approach.

The only thing I could perhaps say is that our room was far too warm. When we asked the hotel staff if there was any way that they could turn down the heat they refused. However all the staff that we dealt with during our stay were polite and helpful. They even booked our shuttle bus back to the airport saving us the job. The airline lost my boyfriend's bag on our arrival in New York, but the staff at the Americana assisted us by giving us a ring when his luggage was eventually delivered. The location really cannot be beaten for the price, only 4 blocks from Times Square and a five minute walk to Fifth Avenue. Oh and the Bryant Deli over the road is fantastic!

The Americana Inn was walking distance to most everything we wanted to do and see. There is also easy access to bus routes and subways if you decide to venture farther out. The room was small, but we expected that. The bad part was being on the 5th floor where it was very evident that someone had been regularly smoking on the floor, and that housekeeping was using spray air freshener to cover it up. I am very sensitive to those sprays and it was so bad that I asked to be changed to a different floor. I was told that it was not possible that night and they would move us the next day. Note: They indicated that smoking was not allowed, to which I responded, \"you may know that and I may know that, but someone has been smoking, and the awful spray is not the fix\". I would have rather put up with the smoke smell. They had no suggestions or remedys to my inability to breath without covering my nose. I slept breathing through a wet cloth most of the 1st night. The next day, we inquired about our move to a new room and we were told that the night person had no business promising us a new room and there was no other room to move us to for the rest of the week. Again there was no suggestions on what I could do other than tell the housekeeping not to use the spray air freshener in our room. We looked into a few hotels in the near vicinity, but one night in those hotels would have been as much as our entire stay at the Americana, and at the time we were not prepared to pay that much. I ended up going to a Starbucks, buying a lb. of freshly ground coffee and a couple of their large filters. Back in the room, I spread a large amount of coffee grounds over a flattened filter and that actually helped cover up the artificial spray. Each day I put out a new filter with new grounds. At least I was able to sleep without covering my nose. I waited to post this review just to give me space not to emotionally rant. I am generally not a hard person to please, I expect that not everything is going to be perfect every time, but I felt that my stay was greatly downgraded by the intolerable smell and lack of remedy by the staff.

Take flip flops for bathroom visits as the bathrooms are very clean the floor is tiled so if someone has taken a shower before you go in you might get wet feet. Our room was key card so felt secure and we were given two key cards. The room itself was tiny (we expected this) Double bed, chest of drawers and sink. Small wardrobe. Hardly any room for our two cases. The room was very clean but really noisey. Getting to sleep at night was hard with all the beeping cars. The garbage truck came every morning about 5am and felt like it was in the room with you. The room was a good temp but during the early hours it did get cold due to the lack of double glazing.

The shared bathrooms even though they were fairly clean most of the time were a real pain, the bathrooms were busy and we ended up walking around the corridor trying to find one that wasnt being used. The bathrooms were cold and damp and the bathroom plugs didnt work it was a shower or nothing. The rooms are very basic and not much room inside you end up with stuff all over the floor not much space to store anything, The tv was useless about 3 channels that actually worked no movie channels or anything overall I can understand why people are getting carried away with the location it is handy but really even though it is cheaper than most hotels its worth spending the money and going somewhere that has better amenities and is more comfortable", "Date": "May 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bournemouth", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!\u201d", "Author": "DIAS420", "ReviewID": "UR15511648", "Content": "Well...My friend and I spent HOURS trying to find a cheap hotel online but all we could seem to find was hostels.

There are 5 floors in the building and the lobby is located on the 2nd. To enter the building you have to buzz the front door and the front desk will let you in. There is a public computer with internet access for guess to use, and shared kitchens and several bathrooms on each floor. In addition the front desk service was very friendly and accomodating. For those of you squemish about using public bathrooms the bathrooms here were kept fairly decent, except for the first day in which the toilet needed a bit of a cleaning. TIP: if you plan on using the shower make sure you bring some slippers. We stayed in room 516. The room was decent, nothing out of the ordinary. Room consisted of 1 double bed, and lcd tv, a desk upon which a basket full of towels, soap etc was placed. However we did not have a sink which you can see clearly on the pictures advertised on their website. TIP: If you want a sink make sure you request one, also there are NO safety deposit boxes in the rooms. PROS: We were out of the hotel for most of the day but when we did return, our rooms were cleaned and we were given fresh towels. CONS: The walls of the room are not that thick and you might be able to hear your neighbours next door or vice a versa. Another thing to point out is that there is NO central air as the hotel was quite warm but there IS a noisy air conditioning unit located right behind the bed, making sleeping with the A/C on absolutely unbearable.

The point here is that you really get what you pay for, and we booked this hotel for $90/night and in Manhattan, so close to everything, this was a steal. The location absolutely cannot be beat. We ate at three different little diners in the area (Starwich, PAX and Jimmy's Cafe) and were very pleased with the location near the Subway, 5th Ave shopping, and Times Square. But... After requesting a quiet room through our online reservation, a separate email and a phone call to confirm, we were assigned to an on-street room. After barely being able to sleep the first night from all of the street noise, we inspected our window and realized that it had a gap in the top pane. So, after properly closing the window, the noise was reduced, which goes to show the quality of the hotel. Also, the electronic key lock did not work. My boyfriend and I were in Room 204, right next to the \"lobby\" so the desk attendant had to basically open our door for us with his key every-time we came in and out of the room. They did have someone come to fix it promptly the next morning, but it was on the fritz on and off our whole stay which was slightly annoying. There was only one night that our linens were free of stains or new looking. I would bring several of your own towels, because you only get two towels a day that are no larger than a regular hand towel. And bring shower shoes and slippers because the floor is linoleum. If you are looking for a glamourous, comfy, fancy trip to New York, do not stay here. My dorm in college was cleaner and nicer than the Americana. I wondered what kind of gross thing I would find every time I went to the shared bathrooms (and it was gross, people leaving the seat up, pee (and worse) on the seat, hair all in the shower, etc...gross!!!) All I can say is at least there were no bugs! I was expecting better because the previous reviews on TripAdvisor made it sound like there was a maid there all day cleaning-- there was not! This was not a place that I really looked forward to returning to everyday after being on my feet all day long in New York City, standing in lines for everything. I will say that the new paint job in the rooms, the LCD flat screen TV and new sink, mirror and lighting fixture were a nice touch. I just wish that the rest of the hotel looked this new. Now, my boyfriend who is used to staying in budget hotels & hostels in Europe, etc.. couldn't have been happier with this hotel and gave it shining, rave reviews, and says that he would not hesitate to stay here again.

I found that the only way is to go for rooms that are not ensuite, like those at Americana Inn. This can literally half the price - and considering that the bathroom was actually just next door to our room, and it was big, clean and always free then it is really worth it! The room had everything else that you'd expect in a swankier place - sink, mirror, TV, towels, drawers, cupboard, air-con, etc. So although the place looks pretty grotty on arrival, with a sparse lobby on second floor and lino rather than carpets, it has everything you need. And who's hanging around their hotel anyway when they're in New York!? I even think our room was a better size than more expensive places... oh, and there was a kitchen on our floor with fridge, microwave, etc. And the location was fab - just a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building, so in the middle of midtown Manhattan. A nice area and great to get around to everywhere else... I would definitely come back to Americana Inn - perfect for the bit-more-than-just-budget traveller.

This hotel was fantastic!! It is definately worth paying that little bit extra if you are looking for something a bit better than a hostel - the rooms and separate bathrooms look as though they have been recently refurbished, they were immaculately cleaned at least once a day with fresh new towels and toiletries in our room. The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful...I honestly cannot fault this place at all! The location was fantastic on 38th St, 1 block from 5th avenue (shopping heaven!) and 4 blocks from Time Square. It can be loud in the rooms due to the huge amount of traffic outside but to be honest, in a massive city like New York I think it is all part of the experience!!

I really can't say enough about the LOCATION!!! We were easily able to walk from Grand Central Station (about a 15 minute walk), it's 4 blocks from Macy's, 2 blocks to either the red subway line or orange subway line, approx. 4 blocks to Times Square. Myself and my 14-year-old daughter walked everywhere. I didn't like walking 38th street too much (we only walked on that street once when we arrived), but 6th Avenue was great. Also, across the street is a little deli that's open 24 hours. HOW CONVENIENT!!

You cant go wrong- we pre booked it but i think you can order one from the desk in the arrivals lounge at JFK. Our room was small but clean and tidy with all you need, although no tea and coffee making facilities but the deli over the road is open 24/7 and has great fresh coffee - or a star bucks can be found on virtually every street corner of NYC!!! The room had no ensuite but the shared bathroom was big and clean- i was really worried about this fact before we went- (i wasnt very keen on sharing a bathroom with others) but it worked out fine- they are good quality and cleaned every hour. Our room was opposite our shared bathroom which we shared with the room next door ( normally 2 bedrooms share the one bathroom) The security is good too- you have to be buzzed in and walk past the front desk which is on the first floor so the security person can see whoever enters or exits the building. There is a lift for when your tired or have heavy shopping bags ( macy's is only round the corner!!!) The hotel is located in the fashion district and is within wealking distance of almost everything you could want to see. Times square is about 5-10 minute walk from the hotel and other attractions are easy to walk. We were in NYC for 5 days and didnt get a taxi once- if you walk you get to see much more. We did get the greyline bus tour for one of the days, which was good- if you do this first you can get your barings and evrrything is then easy to find. We went to NYC in Feb 2006- it was VERY cold- i would advise lots of warm clothes and hand warmers for inside your gloves- it was -7 and it gets quite windy! so go prepared!

The rooms are small but very clean, and we were even able to get a smoking room which was a suprise. The staff on reception were very friendly, and made us feel welcome. The hotel has shaed bathrooms but there are four on each floor so you can usually find one that's free, and again these were spotless. Another huge plus for us was that the hotel provides a safety deposit-box facility (for free!) so you can safely store any valuables - the boxes are in the office behind reception and we were told we could just wander through as and when we needed to. To access the box you need two keys - the master key and the key you are given to hold on to. The hotel's on 6th and 38th, which is about four blocks from the Empire State Building, Madison Square Gardens, and Times Square. If you want a breakfast, turn right out of the hotel door, walk one block to 7th Avenue (there's a drugstore on the opposite corner), turn right and walk one block North - there's a diner on the corner called Andrews which'll sort you out nice and cheaply. The only problem we had was sleeping due to traffic noise, but I'd imagine this would be a problem in most hotels in the area. I'd recommend taking ear plugs!

Easy walking distance to key attractions, e.g. Empire State, Time Square, 5th Avenue, Broadway, Macy's, subway access to downtown and uptown - all about 5 mins walk away.

Double bed, walk in wardrobe (enough room for shopping bags!), chest of drawers, TV (with about 15 random channels), sink and cabinet. This was not en suite however there were 4 bathrooms (one disabled access) for approx 15 rooms on our floor.

You can't beat it. Everything & anything is there or easily accessible. Cons: If your room faces 6th Ave., it will be really loud. I specifically asked for a room facing 38th St. and it was fine.

I must admit to some trepidation before our trip as I'd made my selection of Hotel entirely on TripAdvisor reviews! As far as I could work out after extensive research, The Americana Inn seemed to be the only cheap and cheerful hotel with mostly good reviews in NYC! I was worried that our reservation would not be in place as this seemed to be the most common problem. I booked through the Hotel's website and we paid around $100 per night for a twin room including tax. I needn't have worried as when we arrived everything was order and our reservation for the following week was also in place. The buzzer to let you in the lobby was manned constantly so we never had to wait to get in. The lift was quite small and slow but to be honest we only used it when checking in and out anyway. You can fit two people and two suitcases in - any more than that is a bit cosy! The hotel is only 5 floors anyway so walking up isn't exactly a hardship. Our room was set back from 6th Avenue on 38th Street so the full force of the traffic noise (quite amazing - bring earplugs and don't bother opening the window as you won't be able to hear yourself think!) was not revealed until we returned the following week and had a room overlooking 6th Avenue. Ok, so the room was very small but there was a large wardrobe which was plenty big enough to store suitcases and a large chest of drawers. And to repeat everyone else on this site, you're only using the room to sleep in anyway! The room was spotlessly cleaned everyday, with a small basket left including clean towels, soap, paper cups and a spare loo roll. And the obligatory tip envelope... The bathrooms (of which there was 1 for every 4 or 5 rooms) were cleaned twice a day and there was always hot water. We never had to wait for a bathroom and having a private bathroom (as opposed to the gym showers you get in Youth Hostels) was pleasant!The showers were pretty good and I'd recommend taking one of the towels in with you to use as a bathmat to avoid flooding situations when you step out of the shower. Use the bathroom next to the lift on each floor if you can as they're the ones with windows so don't get as hot. All the cleaning staff we came across were very friendly and never failed to smile. This was mostly true of the staff on reception too (which is manned all the time - quite reassuring). And now for the however... After we'd been to Washington we returned to The Americana Inn and to our delight got a larger room overlooking 6th Avenue. Unfortunately the traffic noise was horrendous and we couldn't close the windows (being feeble females) but housekeeping sorted that out for us after we asked at reception). We could at least then sleep! Unfortunately after a couple of days the weather turned a bit parky and the heating came on which was ok while awake but absolutely excrutiatingly hot whilst trying to sleep. At 4am I eventually couldn't stand it anymore and went and asked reception how to turn it off. The gentleman behind reception explained he couldn't switch it off as it was centrally controlled and the people who lived in the building complained to 'The City' if it was too cold and The Americana Inn would get fined. Arrgh!! He suggested I open the windows and wasn't really very helpful to my pleas that the traffic would put paid to any chance of sleep. Never mind, after two nights the weather got a bit better, the heating got switched off and I could get some sleep. Red Bull's a wonderful thing... And then, 2 nights before we left my friend saw a mouse run under my bed. We spoke to Reception (who didn't apologise and looked blankly at me) and demanded to be moved rooms. We were moved to a room away from 6th Avenue (hurrah!) and on check-out I eventually got money taken off the bill although the gentleman didn't seem to understand why having a mouse running around was a problem. He even tried to be suprised about it although surely somewhere that has mouse traps everywhere (humane ones, don't worry!) must be aware of a mouse problem! He rang the manager of the Hotel when I stood my ground and we had a night's charge taken off the bill. I felt this was very generous as I was only really looking for an apology and a token gesture of a small discount! I didn't get an apology but oh well, at least it took a bit of shopping pressure off the Visa bill! Would I stay here again? The location was brilliant: walking distance to Times Square, Macy's and Empire State Building but I think the traffic noise did my head in sufficiently enough to fork out to stay somewhere with air conditioning I can control myself, at least 30 floors between myself and the street, and triple glazing. And having a mouse running around does kind of turn my stomach a tad! By the way, I'd recommend the following to tourists in NYC: Don't bother with Empire State Building - it's really busy all the time so you have to wait to get near the view. Go up Top of The Rock at Rockefellar Centre instead. It's not quite as high but the views are much better as you can see the Park properly and also the Empire State Building! Top of The Rock has only just re-opened after twenty years and not many people know about it yet. We went up to see the sunset and the lights come on across the city and it was absolutely beautiful. Hardly anyone else was up there and the difference in the way we were treated was remarkable. You were just left to enjoy the view rather than be treated like tourists with too much money to spend. At Empire State you are constantly bombarded with people trying to get you to part with your hard-earned cash (on souvenir photographs of yourselves in front of a picture of the building, on audio tours, on skyrides etc). You even have to walk through a giftshop to get to and from the lifts at the top. Top of the Rock is much more understated and you don't have to go in the shop if you don't want to! I would also highly recommend going on the Greenwich Village food tour - it was a fascinating insight into the culture and history of the area, as well as taking you round some of the local eateries. Finally, if you do decide to stay at The Americana Inn, go to Guy & Gallard across 6th avenue for breakfast. They're so friendly in there and serve about ten different types of coffee!", "Date": "April 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood value, good location.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4740340", "Content": "My wife and i stayed here for a week over the St Patricks Day celebration.

The shared bathrooms were also very clean and plentiful. There was always a spare bathroom on the floor even if the one directly attributed to your room wasn't available.

A few streets up and an avenue across and you are in Times Square! The Empire State Building and Madison Square Garden are less than ten minutes away. I cannot stress how good the location of this hotel is. This trip was my second visit to New York and was much improved by the change of hotel from the Habitat to the Americana Inn. I am sure there might be people who find this hotel too basic or disapprove of the magnolia walls, but for people on a budget who still want to stay in a safe, good hotel this is an excellent choice. However if you are a light sleeper you may want to try and request a room a few floors up or at the back of the hotel as we had a first floor room overlooking the street and it was very noisy from 7am, with the endless plod of business men and women on their way to work and the ceaseless traffic.

The excuse I was given was that they use lots of companies to book rooms at the Inn - although I booked mine directly through the Americana Inn website. A guest who was checking out in reception told me I was one of fifteen to be turned away that day.

This ended up costing me dramatically more than the Americana Inn (who refused to pay the difference) but it was a necessary expense as I had made the trip especially for the marathon. It doesn't seem to matter if you have reservations and printed confirmations - this stands for nothing. I would avoid the Americana Inn at all costs.

We only stayed there for 4 nights. Price: VERY GOOD!! I booked online on their own website. It was only $399 USD for the whole for nites (this includes taxes). Rooms & cleaniness: Very clean. White walls and light green accents. The room was a little small, but still enough to fit 2 suitcases flat on the ground. There was a sink in the room. Towels were ok, but we brought our own anyways. Our room faced the street, no disturbances, just ocassional police sirens. Bathroom: very clean. Even though we needed to share the baths, I never had to wait once. There's 3 bathrooms on my floor (3rd floor). Service: We kept the \"do not disturb\" sign out all the time. But, the front desk was very helpful. He suggested the \"airport shuttle\" back to the airport when we left. $20/person. Safety: Very safe! You have to get buzzed in 2 doors on the 1st floor. The front desk is on the second floor. When you go up the stairs, you must pass by the front desk before you go up. The elevator always stops on the 2nd floor. So, I felt it was very safe. Location: \"location! location! location!\" VERY GOOD!!! It's very close to times square. 6th ave & 38th street. Close by to many things. Even if you take the taxi, it's good price. For the price, I totally recommed this hotel. Spend your money on other things (food is SO expensive!!). But, keeping in mind, you just want a clean, safe, and close to town place to sleep.

This place is fantastic for the price you pay! Okay, it's not luxurious but if you'd rather spend your money on entertainment this is perfect! The hotel is slap bang in the middle of Manhattan; walk out of the hotel and on your left is Fifth Avenue (about four blocks from the Empire State Building which is about a ten minute walk - if that - and in the opposite direction four blocks to Grand Central) - on your right is Sixth avenue and Broadway (A few short blocks to Times Square also). So location is perfect! Yes, the rooms are small but they are perfectly liveable and very very clean! We had a double bed which was so comfy (perfect for a good nights sleep after all the walking we did) - sheets were changed everyday (if you put your sign for house keeping out) and a lovely little towel basket fresh each day with clean towels, soap and some plastic drinking cups. We had a telly with plenty of TV channels and a chest of drawers. In the corner of the room was a cupboard for hanging clothes and storing suitcases. Every room has air conditioning which is such a relief in this very sticky city! Each floor has a little kitchen (no utensils though) so if you bring or buy stuff you can make yourself food or drinks (I have to admit we ate out every night so didn't use this facility). I was worried about the shared bathrooms but needn't have been! They were kept very clean and we only had to wait once or twice the whole time we were there. There are about four to every floor. They were constantly supplied with toilet roll and the shower was clean and warm. We were on the fifth floor at the back of the hotel so we didn't suffer form much noise disturbance so I can't comment on that but if you ask reception for a room at the back they will happily provide. The guys on reception were friendly and helpful and booked our shuttle bus back to the airport for us. The only annoying things about the hotel are: 1. The lift stops at the 2nd floor every time (this is because reception is on the 2nd floor and they don't want new guests getting lost on other floors looking for the reception so in a way it's a good thing) 2. The hotel communal areas such as hallways and lobby are very very warm! But once you're in your room with the air conditioning it's cool and refreshing so only a minor minor complaint! So all in all, I would recommend this hotel to anyone (so long as though don't want shag pile carpets and large spacious suites). It is perfect for the price, in an ideal location, comfy and above all, VERY CLEAN! (I forgot to mention it was recently painted so they obviously take care of their hotel).

We had read the reviews on Tripadvisor, so we were aware of the street noise, and the shared rest rooms in the hall before we arrived. We did not have too high expectations, but Americana Inn was a pleasant surprise - much better than hoped for. The room was spotlessly clean (newly painted, I think?), the bed was great, daily maid-service and fresh towels, a TV set (which we did not use), air-conditioning worked perfectly - all that we wanted. I found the staff to be very helpful - the safety box was free to use and they gave good advice as to directions etc. The location could not have been more central and the neighborhood seemed safe enough. Street noise, yes, especially on the 2nd floor where we stayed, but it was just cars going by continuously - it was more of a background noise and it does not disturb your sleep, but bring earplugs, just in case! Yes, you do have to share the (nice and clean) restrooms and showers with others, but we never experienced any waiting. We would have preferred our own restroom and shower, naturally, but that would have cost quite a lot extra (see e.g. the prices on the hotel Belvedere which we also considered) - and it really was not that big a deal to share. In other words, we found the hotel to be a good bargain - what we saved on the hotel price easily paid for all our meals, entrance fees and transportation during our stay in New York.

This place will do, but you should know what you are getting into. It's located in a light industrial area, which is mildly interesting but not very convenient. It's four blocks from the nearest subway station, but six blocks from numerous different subway lines, especially at Times Square (42nd St and 7th Ave, walk along Broadway). It's just busy enough at night not to feel deserted, without being busy enough to overwhelm you with noise. You have to get buzzed in, the hotel lobby is on the second floor, and you'll be talking to the desk clerk through glass. Rooms are quite small and really basic. Mine had a TV and air conditioner but no refrigerator (fine with me). I had a shared bathroom (don't know if other rooms have their own bathrooms), but it was fine. The building is old, but then lots of expensive hotels on the east coast are in old buildings, and the general atmosphere is not especially shabby. Bring shampoo, and while they've got towels you might feel more homey if you bring a towel too. They've got an Internet connection and a coke machine, and there was a door labeled \"kitchen\" that I didn't investigate, but that's about it for the hotel facilities. The people behind the desk seemed basically fine, scarcely enthusiastic about their jobs but not at all difficult. The maids seemed cheerful but I kept the \"stay out\" sign on my door so I don't know much more. I did have one untoward experience when I first arrived. The guy assigned me to a room right nearby the lobby. It was okay, I guess, except that the towels were small and gross and, oh man!, had a roach crawling on them. I told this to the guy behind the desk, who seemed mildly surprised and concerned and without hassle got me a different room, which however backed up against the first and shared a wall with the bathroom. I was uncomfortable about this, but I got used to it and it worked out fine.

The TV was OK, not loads of channels but enough to occupy yourself for the limited time you spend in your rooms. The room we stayed in was quite small and we did have to sit on the end of the bed to use the sink, but it was nice to have a private sink so when you weigh it up it is worth it. We just about had enough room to keep our cases open while we were there, and there was a decent sized chest of drawers and cupboard. Internet access was good, $1 for ten minutes which is cheap compared to some places, and there was also a drinks machine.

There were no double bedrooms available the night we arrived so they apologetically offered us a room with three single beds in it and told we could have a double room the next day. The room was very big with plenty of room and a spare bed to store our belongings so we didn't bother swapping. It was very clean and warm. i must admit i was expecting worse from a hotel rated 1 and a half stars, (despite the good reviews) but it was furnished well and reminded me of a travel tavern kind of place. The staff were all very friendly, especially the cleaners who went out of their way to help us when our door wouldn't open, this was easily solved at the front desk. I must admit we felt very safe having to buzz in and having extra bolts on the door and when the batteries on our tv remote ran out the staff happily replaced them for us. It is excellently placed, literally a five minute walk from Times square and another 5 in the opposite direction for Macy's and other shops. The television had plenty of channels(about 15) and our bathroom was just outside our door meaning it was almost as good as having it in the room. We had no trouble from other guests and i never ever found anyone in the bathroom plus the shower was great - extremeley powerful! Our bedroom was made up everyday, and fresh towels and soaps etc left in a basket. Admittedly we're only in our early twenties and we haven't stayed in a lot of hotels but for someone who has big issues with cleanliness and warmth this hotel was brilliant. I can only imagine the people who gave bad reviews are used to staying in hotels witha higher star rating than this (which begs the question - why stay there in the first place?) I mean come on! Do you really need someone to carry your bags for you when there is a lift and all the rooms are close to it? The people on the front desk need to be there to let people into the hotel not worry about lazy people who can't carry their own luggage! We were always buzzed in promptly, even in the early hours of the morning. In response to reports of the rooms being too hot, i must admit it was fairly over heated but whilst we were there, there were reports of a snowstorm and i think they would have receieved a few more complaints if the rooms were too cold! We left our windows ajar in the day and then closed them at night. Even with them open it wasn't so bad, i wear ear plugs to sleep in anyway but my boyfriend had no trouble sleeping with out them.
