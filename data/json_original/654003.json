Breakfast is a self service buffet with plenty of hot and cold foods to choose from. What really made our stay at this hotel so nice was the staff - they were extremely friendly, polite and helpful. They carried out their work in a professional, efficient and unobtrusive way but were always there to offer assistance if needed. They are a really great asset to this hotel.

Imagine as we step out of the taxi, we are greeted at the door and our luggage is whisked up the stairs. As we walk into the lobby we are welcomed by the nicest, friendliest man at the front desk. I believe his name was Salvo. He greeted us by name!! He spoke impeccable English, pulled out a map and showed us where everything was. The rest of the staff that we encountered during our stay were equally helpful if not as memorable. The room was nice, the bed was comfortable, we had free wifi. For breakfast they served a free buffet in their breakfast room. Again, the staff was very friendly and the food was good. I have only one complaint about the hotel and that was the elevator. It stopped between floors so that you still had to go down a flight of stairs to get to your room. After one day in Rome, the arthritis in my knee was pretty bad and I didn't really want to do the stairs but didn't have a choice.

The location is great and within walking distance to the Pantheon, Capuchin Crypt, Spanish Steps and depending how far your legs can go the Colosseum. Great location to catch the metro and get off at all the sites too. We utilized it all and really loved the energy that came with the hotel and the surroundings. One drawback, we live in Naples, and drove our car up and ended up leaving it in a parking lot close to the Colosseum because the parking in the area is pretty non-existent. We did notice parking in the Spanish Steps area but it was Carnevale weekend and we just didn't feel like messing with it......So parking is not really there..... Our shower was full of jets and the pressure was great!!!! We were surprised at the size of the room. Most hotel rooms in Europe are quite small.

The staff at this hotel is what made our trip, If I could name them all I would, but a big thank you must go to Salvatore who was so attentive to all our needs and requirements. Having read the previous review it would appear to us that it must have been a different hotel. I will say the shower was a little on the small side but - thats Europe isnt it?? Thank you again to all the wonderful staff who made our stay at Trevi so special from Salvatore to the guy on the desk - John from Argentina ??? to the boys in the breakfast room and rooftop bar at night nothing was ever too much trouble. Also a massive thank you to the man who had to carry my 35kg bag up and down those stairs - dont know how you did it.

Once we got home from the airport that night I followed up with an email and informed them I would call as we had been advised to do. I got up at 2:30AM our time in order to call and that gentleman indicated that there was no manager that worked on the weekend(it was Saturday) and that he saw where I had emailed so the manager would respond to my email on Monday, he told me to not call back. Of course no email came on Monday or Tuesday, etc. I sent another email simply asking that they please respond to my email, I understand having to have a policy but I remained hopeful that the manager, especially if the room had been rented out, would understand I could not control weather and would not charge my card. Needless to say I never heard back from anyone and I sent several other emails and today my credit card came in and it was charged, not a cheap room might I add. When I orginally booked the room they were quick to respond to the numerous emails I sent but I guess they are only interested in being helpful if it serves them.

We chose to stay at the Annex, about a block away from the main hotel, and chose not to have breakfast included. We were very happy with our decision and would definitely stay there again and make those same choices. We saved about 30 Euro a night staying in the Annex and I think another 20 Euro not having breakfast. The Annex was nice and quiet and at night it was quaint with the street being lit up by candles. If we needed anything we could walk over to the hotel or call. It was actually nice being just a block off of the fountain and away from so many people (and the noise). One morning we had their breakfast and it was definitely a good value. However, we wanted to explore other options in the area. A TIP--Try the coffee bars. Stand up. It's cheaper than sitting down! One morning we had pastries and coffee for about 3 Euro each at a place about a block away and it was excellent. The location is perfect. We walked everywhere. Bring comfy shoes!! We walked to the Borghese Gallery (reservations required), Forum, Spanish Steps, Colossium, etc. The only place we took a subway was to the Vatican. Another TIP--Get the Roma Pass at the airport when you arrive in Terminal 3. It's 25 Euro and includes free public transportation and two entries (and after that reduced rates) into almost all of the sites. Obviously use the freebies on the most expensive tickets. You can also skip a lot of the lines. Oh, and download Rick Steves' many free podcasts on your ipod and you won't have to rent audio tours when you go places. If you ask, the hotel will arrange airport transportation. We paid 50 Euro total for a \"limo service\" which included a black Mercedes with black leather interior with a classic Italian looking (and musky smelling) driver in a nice suit. It was awesome! Easier and not much more than either a cab or public transport. He was waiting for us and was very friendly. The hotel also helped us out when our luggage didn't arrive when we did.

We had 2 rooms 1 for my husband and I and 1 for my mother. The location was great, it was within steps of the Trevi Fountain. Our overall Room #105 layout: larger than most we'd stayed in. no carpet, wood floors, 2 nightstands, 1 flat screen tv that was mounted on the wall, large closet and a desk. THe room was also right next to the housekeeping room so all night we heard the phone ringing and buzzing. Thin walls Mom's overall room layout: not large at all, the bed took up the whole room, it had a small closet and a desk with a tv on top of it. No window Our Bathroom: shower and bath area were extremely small but that was expected. The toliet was literally against the wall so you could not sit on it normally you had to side saddle it so to speak. It was quite funny. I had to go across the hall to use my Mom's restroom because it was ackward. (I had to take photo of this but wish I'd taken more of the room) Mom's Bathroom: Very roomy, almost as large as the rest of the room. even had a door that went out to some sort of patio. The patio was somewhat strange because it was just a large holding place for old stuff from the hotel. Kind of creepy. We were told by an older man at the desk on arrival we were \"lucky\" to have received such a great room and that he \" didn't know how that happened\" but we had a great view. That was ridiculous to say the least. The room had a window that overlooked the front of the hotel. If you turned your head to the left sharply you could see the Trevi fountain. You could hear all the action going on around the fountain and below all night. The facility is heated without controls in your room so it was often too warm for us and we wanted to open the window to get some fresh air however since there are many smokers in Italy and our room was right above a neighboring restaurant the smoke was overwhelming. Breakfast: powdered eggs, coffee, fruit, rolls, toast, yogurt, juice. some sort of meat that I didn't recognize. The staff were nice except for the older man we met upon arrival.

I researched the perfect hotel for days. I came across Relais and noticed pretty good reviews and prices so we booked it.

For a standard bedroom, I paid 200 euro a night which is a great deal for being right in front of the Fontana Di Trevi and close walking distance to other sites. We got there early and the staff was cheerful and held our bags until our rooms were ready. They even helped out my now fiance get roses into the room the night he proposed to me at the Piazza di Spanga. We had a standard room and I found it to be charming and more spacious than I thought it would be. The bathroom was cute. It was a cross between antique marble with updated fixtures and soaps. We didn't have a view but we didn't mind. My sister and her husband were celebrating their 1 year anniversary so they splurged and got the room with the Trevi View. It was huge! The window was small but you can really sense the activity below but was still quiet at night. The world cup was going on and the staff helped us figure out how to plug in our computer to the tv. Now, for anyone that complains about the breakfast who isn't from Italy( I am Italian- American), Italians don't do breakfast the way we do in America, so I found their continental breakfast really lovely and suprising.

The first night we slept through it but woke up hot (and with a cold/flu), the second night we tried turning off the air con as in other hotels this kicks in the air con - it didn't work but we slept through it, by the third night we were over it, I was really sick and we rang reception at 2am and the man who came up couldn't get it to work so our only alternative was to sleep with the windows open - with a nearby church bell ringing literally every 15 minutes! Obviously we didn't get any sleep. When we complained the following morning upon checking out the reception girl said that the manager wasn't in, couldn't be contacted but to email him and he will refund our money for the final night and assured us she would tell him what happened. We emailed the manager to ask for a reimbursement of our final night stay when we received no sleep which I feel was reasonable as we complained in the night and the night reception guy agreed that the room was very hot. After many emails back and fourth with someone who would probably win the rudest hotel manager of Italy award - he has refused to refund us for our final night stay even though one of his staff members said he would. All he cared about in his email exchange was to mention repeatedly that he will refer us to his lawyers if we wrote about our experience at his hotel. Other reviews on this site have repeatedly made mention of how rude he is also. Other negative points about this hotel - we asked on the first day if the receptionist could ring and book a restaurant for us (no other hotel has had issue with doing this) and she said \"Perhaps you could just ring and do this yourself\" - at ridiculous call rates from the room and from our mobile phones? I think not. I'm sure the hotel had some positive points aside from the location near the Trevi but after dealing with such a rude manager who has refused to apologise or reimburse us, I can't seem to recall any.

Breakfast was fantastic. Not only did they have the typical Roman fare of cold cuts, cheese and breads, but they also provided several types of eggs, including omlette and crepes. Staff was wonderful and eager to please. Free internet was great since we didn't book any tours and wanted up to date information. Make sure you mention this to the reception when checking in.

It was worth it, as it was still less than other hotels with comparable locations. Very convenient, and great fun to be near the Fountain. Upon arriving for a 7 night stay, we found we had been upgraded to a large room (106) with a street view (the Fountain itself was just out of view but we could watch the crowds at it). The rooms are beautifully decorated with fabric upholstered walls and white-painted beamed ceilings. I thought the art choices were unfortunate, they clashed unsympathetically with the otherwise classy decor; black and white photos of the fountain and neighborhood would have been a simpler and better choice. Bathrooms are clean, 4 fixture rooms, if a bit tight in the narrow dimension. Rooms feature a built-in desk with refrigerator and four foot closet with a safe. The small but sufficient lobby is on the first floor (what Americans call the second) up a narrow stairway, but the staff rushes to carry all luggage, so no problem. A free computer with internet access in the corner of the lobby is quite convenient. Sliding glass doors isolate each corridor from the stair and associated noise. Cabs called by the front desk respond very quickly, arriving through the pedestrian congestion within 5 minutes. The staff is good. The manager John is competent and runs a tight ship, although you get the impression he is a bit stiff. Alejandro at the front desk and Red on the roof deck were delights. I regretted that my last apertivo meant no more nightly joking with Red. They have a small white \"lobby dog\" named Willy, who is very friendly. Breakfast is varied, plentiful, and good. The roof deck, as many have mentioned as a great corner view of the Fountain, and makes breakfast fun. They have a nice indoor room too, if the weather is cold. The hotel is trying to get a bar/restaurant business going at night on the roof deck. I had before-dinner drinks (an Aperol spritz initially suggested by Red) every night, but never ate dinner there. Very pleasant way to begin the evening. The staff seems to have a good sense of the guest's coming and goings (probably tracked via the electronic key cards in the light slots), as the room always seemed to be cleaned and made up at the right time, and chocolates always appeared on our pillows before we returned at night no matter what our schedule. All wake-up calls requested were on time. Street noise is present, but the double-glazed and weatherstripped windows block most of it out when you don't want it. Only on our first night (a Friday) did it interfere with sleeping when some college students decided to go swimming in the fountain at 2:00 AM, complete with war whoops and cheering.

Everything you've heard is true, it is indeed the heart of Europe. I live in Fort Lauderdale Florida US and i traveled to Italy by myself. The way from the airport to my hotel was amazing! It was dark but i could see thru my taxi cab windows many beautiful monuments throwout the city; i was literately blown away. I had never in my life seen a monument of the size of the Victor Emmanuel II in piazza Venezia. My hotel was right across from la Fontana di Trevi, the sole purpose of my trip. I stayed at the Relais Fontana di Trevi Hotel. I believe this was a 3 star hotel and it was perfect! Not too expensive, room service was great, breakfast up in the terrace was just what i had hoped for. From the Fontana di Trevi to Vatican city is probably about an hour walk. I'm personally not a fan of walking but there is so much to see that it makes it all worth it. Besides if you like sweets and you are in Rome, make sure to get a cannoli, this Palermo originated pastry is the best walking partner :) The Roman Colosseum, is not as big as i expected to be, yet it is a huge part of Roman history. I wouldn't recommend paying the extra 6 euros to get the audio tour, it was just confusing. On the other hand, It is a good idea to get with a tour group, sometimes they are a bit more expensive but it eliminates the waiting time in line to get in. Another thing to have in consideration is \"L'uomo italiano\" (the italian man). They are handsome, charming and speak one of the sexiest languages in the world. You would think this is enough to go crazy for them.....wrong!!! I found them to be a bit too aggressive when it comes about flirting. For me this spoiled the idea to get away for a few days alone. They like to get wayyyy too close. So this is my advice for all woman, Do not go alone. it is better if you go with a friend or anyone you know. It can be scary at times. Vatican City, this place is a must. I ended up going there twice just to see La Basilica di San Pietro. A few blocks away is the Vatican museum, in there is the Sixteen Chapel with Miguel Angelo master piece. Rome is by far the most beautiful city i have ever been to, i would love to go back as soon as i get a chance.

My main grumble with this hotel was that I \"got the short end of the stick\" and I was bitterly disappointed with my room - it was nothing like what had been portrayed on their website. Everyone else reviewing this hotel has praised the \"spacious\" rooms and the views. Well, I was in a cramped [supposedly] double room at the back with no view at all. It was quite awful and not worth the money. It also seems like all other reviewers suffered from noise - well I definitely did not suffer any noise stuffed at the back of the hotel as I was. To top it all off, the room was pretty claustrophobic. I cant imagine how two people would go staying in there. The bathroom was pretty basic and the shower rose was broken - which I complained about the first morning but it didnt really get fixed. When I went down to reception to remind them that it needing fixing, the Manager was at reception at the time and he grumbled at me for \"only just reporting this at 6pm\" ......he would not listen to my explanation that I already had reported it. The bed was okay - not particularly soft but bearable enough. The pillows were good which helped make up for the bed. The air conditioning struggled in the heat wave. Breakfast was ok and it was on the roof top terrace overlooking the fountain, which was nice particularly for me coming from my room with n view. The eggs were cold, but there was a reasonable selection of stuff and I cant really compain about the breakfast. On the plus side, I thought that the staff in reception were fantastic and really helpful. Though I do have to agree with one reviewer who commented that for a 4 star hotel it was lacking in a lot of things.

This, by implication would mean that the rooms are very noisy - there is a little noise but nothing to write a bad review about! The windows are triple glazed to keep out as much of the tourist banter as possible - it didn't cause a problem. However, what did cause issue with us was the building work that started on morning one of our holiday at 8.10am - the noise was deafening and after contacting reception, I felt sure that nothing was going to be done about it, as they said it was from an adjoining property. That being said, by the time we had finished breakfast, we were told we were moving to a higher room away from the noise and were given a massive apology for any inconvenience caused. Our new room was much nicer, not that our previous room was bad. The girl on reception was most helpful and really pulled out all the stops to sort our problem out extremely quickly and we were very relieved. The rooms in the hotel are a good size, if a bit warm. The stairs are very steep and the staff will insist on taking your bags from you - there is a lift, so don't be concerned! Breakfast is typical hotel fayre and nothing to write home about. The location of the hotel is excellent! Your are a stone's throw away from Via del Corso and the many bus routes that eminate from there and the shopping is heaven is you are a shoe junkie like me. We bought a Roma pass which was excellent - we got into two Museums for free and all public transport was free also. January is a good time to go to Rome. The sales are on and there is very little queueing for the top attractions. The weather is cold but bright. Restaurants - I would recommend two. Del Sostegno near the Pantheon - tiny trattoria with the most wonderful truffles (and dessert wine) we went there twice - great wine list and fresh typically italian food. Then there is San Marco, near the American Embassy - this is a modern restaurant, with limited atmosphere - but the food is top notch! Three things I would warn you about. We found the Archeobus tour a massive disappointment (open top bus tour around the catacombs etc) - really dull! Also the hawkers around the Trevi are such a pain! Especially the rose sellers - who are the lowest of the low. And finally, the museum of modern art - another disappointment, with completely disinterested staff.

It was my daughters first trip to Rome and I wanted to make it special. Although normally a bargain hunter when it comes to hotels, I decided to treat her to two nights in The Relais di Fontana at 265 euros per night. I basically chose this hotel because of the location and the fact that it advertised a terrace overlooking the Trevi Fountain. When we arrived at the hotel we fell in love with the location, which was literally thirty metres away from the fountain. The street itself was busy, with cafes, ice cream parlours and souvenir shops. The atmosphere was vibrant and we loved it. No problem for us to climb the stairs, but those with mobility problems may struggle. The female receptionist was polite and professional. We had booked a triple room after seeing a photo on the hotel website of a nice large room with three beds. We were disappointed to find that our room although large enough had only a large king size bed and a sofa bed. We found the main bed quite comfortable but the sofa bed was springy and uncomfortable. We did not want to start our trip in Rome by making a fuss so we let it go. The room was, however, clean and nicely decorated. The air conditioning worked well and there was a large flat screen TV in the room. The booking confirmation also stated that the price included the mini bar - but dont be fooled as this actually included two bottles of water. Basic coffee facilities were in the room. The bathroom was brightly decorated and the hotel provided the usual toiletries. Fresh fluffy towels were provided each day and the beds were made up every afternoon. The macerator toilet and shower system were noisy, but no big problem. The main issues we had with this hotel was the fact that on both evenings the terrace was closed and the attitude of the staff, in particular the manager. The hotel had advertised the location and its terrace overlooking the fountain as its main features and in all honesty, the thought of watching the sun go down overlooking the Trevi Fountain with a glass of Italian wine, had forced my hand in booking the hotel. The first evening I asked the young male receptionist why it was not open. Although, his English previously had been very good, he appeared all of a sudden to struggle. I was told that the bar man was ill and nothing could be done - that was that. He showed no particular concern. The next evening, we went up to the terrace again and it was still closed. The young male on reception was busy trying to sort out problems for another couple so I waited, not wanting to be put off this time . At this point another male came out of the office and I discovered that he was the manager. Another customer from the USA had now come into the reception area and he asked the manager directly if the terrace would be open. The manager replied that the bar man was in hospital and the terrace could not be opened. The other customer, my friend and I, all politely explained that we had chosen the hotel because of the beautiful terrace overlooking the fountain. The managers response was unbelievable. He asked me... \"What do you want me to do, the bar man is in hospital\" I said.. \"Employ someone else or get another member of staff to open the terrace\" The other customer explained that he and his wife had been looking forward to spending the evening on the terrace. Ignoring this, the manager then went into detail about how difficult it was in Italy to employ staff etc. etc. I saw that another member of staff was standing near by. He had been friendly, but clearly did not understand the conversation as he was grinning. I suggested to the manager that this staff member could open the terrace for a while and the manager, (who was now acting like Basil from Faulty Towers) started shouting at the poor staff member (Manuel!), saying... \"Why are you smiling? They think you can open the terrace. Tell them you can not open the terrace. Stop smiling\" I couldn't believe it. After listening to more of the managers reasons for not opening the terrace, the other customer asked the manager to open it himself. Basil was not happy with this and growled ... \"Yes. OK. I'll open it for one hour but you have to let me finish my work first\". Clearly getting no where and not wanting to get poor Manuel into any further trouble, we declined his ungracious offer and left. This man obviously does not know how to deal with people. We are very polite people and would never dream of making a fuss over nothing. He was extremely rude and really didn't care. If we hadn't been able to laugh about his attitude, I think we would have left the hotel. (and the fact we had my daughter with us and I didn't want to have to find another hotel that evening) Breakfast at the hotel was (because of the location on the terrace ) - delightful. The buffet is adequate. Probably advisable to get there before 10 am as although breakfast is advertised from 7.30 - 10.30 am this was not the case. We went up at 9.30 and enjoyed the stunning view with a satisfactory, continental breakfast. At 10am my daughter went to refill her juice glass and was told it had all gone. Weird! Anyway, nothing can detract from the lovely terrace area overlooking the Trevi Fountain. A great way to start your day in Rome. The hotel location is brilliant. The Spanish Steps is a ten minute walk away, as is the Pantheon. The Colosseum was about a thirty minute walk (but we took our time) and the Vatican is about 45 minutes. We really enjoyed walking and came across some amazing places en route. There are actually many hotels in the area to choose from. Personally, I would choose another one next time. (simply because of how our problem was dealt with). This hotel is a good choice, with the only main problem, being the manager.", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cCould not have been better!\u201d", "Author": "PNG", "ReviewID": "UR7730207", "Content": "I booked this hotel without the benefit if seeing reviews as it is very new and was a little anxious but it really could not have been better. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was lovely, spacious and very clean. The room was well serviced every day. We travelled with a baby and a small child and the hotel could not have been more helpful. I brought frozen meals for my baby son and the hotel was happy to store them in the freezer and reheat them when asked. The only slight drawback was the lack of a lift connecting the ground floor to reception but staff were always on hand to help lift buggies up the stairs so this really was not a problem. The breakfast terrace has a good view of the Trevi fountain and the rooms are well soundproofed which is important in this very busy area. The location is central and we were able to walk to all main attractions with ease. i would recommend this hotel to anyone (except perhaps those with a mobility problem due to the lack of lift). It was well priced for central Rome and an ideal base for our stay.", "Date": "June 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cWe LOVED this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "leo82", "ReviewID": "UR7657372", "Content": "A perfect location!!
