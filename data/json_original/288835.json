{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Showlet Dear future Florence tourists. As an American group we went to Firenze a few months ago with a group through Explorica... Being high school students these things can get a tad expensive so we were booked at the Cordova and were utterly shocked by our rooms. The beds weren't exactly well kept, the televisions did not work, no shampoo, etc. The towels were like Brillo pads and to say the least we discovered a new form of bathroom use. The showlet A shower and a toilet in one. I suppose the owners didn't believe in using a bit of the space they had wisely so they made a drain in the middle of the room, put a shower head almost right about the toilet, and through a curtain over both.. How CREATIVE! Sense the sarcasm. Overall, we survived and the breakfast was good for those of us who were dieting. cafe was excellent and Florence was beautiful. I can only say that Hotel Cordova struck a chord with us in more than one way. Here is a song the group wrote while we were bored one night. To the tune of hotel california by the eagles.

Being a two star hotel I wasn't going to be be expecting anything too luxurious but nothing prepared me for what was waiting in our room. The only positive things I can really say about this hotel is that we had a very spacious balcony and it was not a far walk to Firenze attractions. Though there was no shampoos, soaps or wash cloths and the shower suceeded in making the whole bathroom drenched. The towels smelled of vinegar and though we were provided with a fan, it was non functional. When me and my room mates asked for a new fan they disreguarded our request. Even with these minor complaints I was willing to stay in the room with optimistic views. It was only when we returned from dinner to find our room infested with cockroaches that gave us a scare. When we went to tell the man at the main desk we laughed in our faces and told us that they have never had a cockroach problem before and do not understand what our fuss is.

We ended in Hotel Cordova because we took one look at the rooms of the hotel recommended and gave it a pass.We were greeted at the front desk by Carmello, an extremely helpful, friendly staff. He showed us the rooms and communicated in english which was a plus, considering its the only thing we speak. Initially we had decided to stay for a night but when we told him we were hunting for a better place, he took the trouble to run us through the city sights and recommended other places, it was like having a walkthrough of all the things to see in Florence, without actually paying for a guide. That made us change our mind and we decided to stick with the hotel for the 3 days we were here.In the evenings, we were accompanied by the evening staff, Simone. He too made our stay even more enjoyable by chatting us up (since there is only one english channel, CNN -it gets tiring after a while). He spoke perfect english from the stint in Canada and don't be fooled by the look of seriousness, he CAN make you laugh.All in all, the rooms are clean and well kept, the toilets are large with a TV. The breakfast has the variety we havent had in any of our other stays, it includes a choice of oats, biscotti, cornflakes, paninis, milk, juice, coffee...pretty sumptous considering we only had a bun, biscotti and coffee in the other hotels we stayed at, for the price. We paid about 60 Euros a night for the 3 night stay.Location is good. The place is quiet and very near the train station, about 10 mins walk. If you get tired, you can always go down the the road in front of the hotel and take any bus to the train station. Coming back from the train station you can take the bus 25 and drop near the Piaza Liberta and take a 3 mins walk back. You don't have to walk all over Florence, Hop on the bus and see where it takes you, it's kinda fun, and they ALWAYS end up back in the train station, or so we reckon, but ask the hotel staff, thats how we found out.We'd definately stay at Hotel Cordova again if we visit Florence in the future.

Hotel Cordova became our site.The room size was reasonable and the room was clean. The mattress was good. We had a balcony that overlooked a fairly quiet street (because it was a fair distant from the main city attractions, albeit still within walking distance). This was a nice feature, but oddly enough, we had to climb out a window to get to it (we could tell other rooms actually had doors to their balconies). The room was quiet despite the hotel being filled with fairly large numbers of high school (?) travel groups. There were a number of negatives though that would prevent me from going back there. First, we had what I call a shoilet. This is a combo shower toilet area. Picture a shower space with a toilet in it! When taking a shower, you close the lid to the toilet and cover the toilet paper roll to minimze wetness. Or, as my husband pointed out, you can kill two birds with one stone! The towels, as noted in a different review, were the same material and thickness as sheets. The breakfast consisted of corn flakes and dinner rolls. Finally, the hotel starts on the 3rd level. While there is a one-person elevator, it lets you off half way between floors so you have to drag your luggage up a set of stairs. While the staff did speak English and were not rude, they also didn't extend any warmth or help.I didn't get to see the rooms of the hotel that we originally booked but based upon the lobby and reviews on this site, it appeared much better than this hotel and was for the same price.", "Date": "Jun 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR651428816", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Pretty Cool I stayed at the Cordova on a school trip.

Just got back, in fact. I booked this hotel through a travel agency b/c it was inexpensive (like $60 US dollars per night?) and I was trying to work with in a budget. I went and checked online after I booked and paid, and saw these reviews and got a little concerned but tried to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt- mainly because I really didn't have much time to try and change the booking. I wish I found the time to change it (and was kicking myself in Florence) because the hotel was about 1 mile from the historic area (the main area with all the history. I live in NYC and I am used to walking everywhere but after walking around Florence all day, that trek back to the hotel is really annoying, especially if you want to go back to your hotel mid/late-day at some point to drop off bags, get ready for dinner, etc.. So, basically, to walk back and forth to the hotel twice a day (morning, late day, and night) actually adds another 4 miles to your day of already about 10 miles of just walking around. Plus, its not a pretty walk. As far as the accomadations - they are bare-boned. The rooms was an ok size and the view was of an alley of some kind - nothing spectacular. The air conditioning didn't work (but it wasn't too hot with the window open). The walls were thin - but not too much noise on the 5th floor, the breakfast hours were 7:30-9am but I didn't bother to go. The bathrooms provided no shampoo and just a tiny bar of soap - no wash cloth. The shower was not great but did the job and I always had a tiny trickle of hot water. Towels were like sheets and smelled like vinager. The people at the front desk were polite and spoke english, but didn't extend themselves (nobody to help with bags, no recommendations on things to do). However, they did give a timely wake up call for 2 of the nights I was there. Also, they lock the front door (street entrance) after midnight so you have to buzz in. The elevator was tiny but worked. All in all- I would never go back or recommend it to anyone because there must be a better hotel in a better location for the same price. If you have to stay here- try to book online tickets to the Accademia to see the David for an early morning time and at least you can take advantage of the hotel's proxemity to the David - its only benefit.Ciao!", "Date": "Aug 22, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR157914170", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not that gud I have just came bac from a 4 night stay and i found the hotel quite ok. but the breakfast was not gud , they rooms did not luk lyk wat they was on the pics on the hotel site also, it smelt lyk sewage around the hotel back , (courtyard) Also the lift broken and was not gud wen getting ur suitcases upstairs.

We've just returned from our class trip and I must admit, before I left, I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews. First, let me address the shower issue. Which really isn't an issue. It's a tiled area with a shower curtain and a drain in the floor. It appears to be the norm in that region. Infact, my bathroom in Venice did not even have a curtain. (that was a resort hotel) But I would suggest your own towels and a pair of shower shoes (which you ought to have anyway). The area that the hotel is situated is gorgeous and since there is SO much to see, you won't be in your room for anytime longer than what you need to sleep and shower. Yes, the rolls are hard. It seems that's how they are, crusty outside and soft inside. At least that is what I found throughout the country. The cappuccino is tremendous though. The juice was better than I've had at other hotels. The staff was incredible. Mind you we were a group of 50+ people mostly middle school kids. I had a clean and relatively quiet room.

Stayed here over a year ago, but still remember the Cordova clearly! The towels provided were more like bed linen, so it was just as well I brought my own! Also, the bathroom, which was very small and had no ventilation, had the toilet in the shower because of the lack of space.

Yep, its only a 2 star... and if you had a better room its would probably be ok. Make sure you are not put on the same floor as reception (i.e. level/piano 3).The room was a good size and the sheets were clean. The bathroom featre combine toilet, bidae, and shower and was dirty and old. It also had a lingering sewage smell.We were inlucky and encountered a teenager night receprion staff that decide to have a party while we were there. They have a tv room also, with the tc so loud that you can here it through the walls.Location wise, the hotel is a half hour walk from the station and is out of the city centre to the extent that the area it dead at night. The street is also a main thorough fare which causes alot of traffic noise at night.Don't stay here....", "Date": "Nov 2, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR854283512", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Hotel recomendable para una...   showReview(20743784, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR172393621", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Air climatis\u8305 sur demande, pas...   showReview(16726307, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR945840556", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d288835-r20223642-Hotel_Cordova-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "288835", "Price": "$119"}}
