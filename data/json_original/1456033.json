We arrived in the rain, and there were some local characters sitting outside, rather unwilling to move. We nearly had to carry our suitcases in to avoid hitting them. Once in, we were changed from 2nd floor to 3rd due to a water problem - and the gentleman who checked us in offered to carry our luggage up. He managed our two 50# suitcases with no apparent problem. The room is t-i-n-y. Cute. The seating area is very attractive but uncomfortable. The bed was fine, the bathroom was tiny but fine. It rained all night, and it sounded like the rain was directly into our room. No leaks, just an unusual architecture. We wandered around in the morning, found our cruise ship, as well as a Starbucks. They held our luggage while we shopped. It was probably 80 degrees and humid when we hauled our suitcases the 6 blocks to the cruise ship. Sure, we could've taken a cab, but it was part of the adventure. Overall, it was ok. I wanted to stay at the Sheraton (or any chain I am familiar with), but it was spring break week and most hotels were unavailable even 6 months in advance. I was getting nervous when I booked the CasaBlanca. It was acceptable - safe, clean, weird, attractive.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a native Puerto Rican. I visit once or twice every year and I have seen Old San Juan being revitalized throughout the years. I do feel nostalgic walking on the blue cobblestones streets that adorn our old city and I have fond memories as a child walking on these streets with my mother eating plantain chips and coconut helados or gelato. Many a times on my visits, I passed by the Casablanca Hotel in Old San Juan and never peaked in. Last year, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help myself. Looking for an oasis in the midst of a hot day with a heavy traffic of cars and tourists, I walked into the hotel lobby. To my surprise, the hotel did not had a film noir qualities of shadows and soft lighting, instead it was rich in color and textures. Beautifully decorated with restored antiques and art from one of the owners according to the receptionist. Me and my best friend from Orlando booked rooms at Casablanca this year. When we arrived, the lobby was as beautiful as I remembered. There was different art on the walls, but the art was just as stunning and colorful. Then wham! Two of our reservations didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show in their systems. The staff was rude, defensive, and condescending. When we asked for the manager to assist us, the girl at the desk said he was out. After I got frustrated and raised my tone of voice due to her lack of empathy, he mysteriously appeared from behind a curtain like a genie, but a condescending and rude one. Pedro was his name. Pedro needs to be trained in customer service as his skills and attitude suck. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an elevator in this hotel; so pack light. No one offer us help to carry our luggage. So, if you need some type of assistance, you may want to book the Sheraton Old San Juan, which is nearby. My friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room was cute, but small. The shower didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a place for toiletries; we put them on the floor. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I hate to pick up soap from the floor. The bed was comfortable. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t room to put luggage and there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t closet or armoire. My reservation was never found so I booked a different hotel. See my upcoming review of Water Club, Isla Verde. The Casablanca was a catastrophic mirage. My friend told me that two days later they moved him to a nicer room, but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make his bed one day because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is only one key to the room and he took it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd WHAT? Have you EVER heard such a lie? He also said he overheard some people complaining in the lobby about having their jewelry being stolen from their room. Even though I had a bad experience with this hotel, I am NOT spiteful. HOWEVER, I urge you to think twice before you book this hotel. Again, the hotel is cute, and so are the rooms. I would NEVER go back to Casablanca unless I know that they have new management and that Pedro is gone.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, some drawbacks\u201d", "Author": "Daniela R", "ReviewID": "UR127661797", "Content": "We booked this hotel for our one night in Old San Juan and the location was perfect.

Where do I begin? First of all, trying to lug heavy suitcases up those stairs just about did me in. There was only one guy (he was nice) at the desk and nobody to help carry the luggage up, it was a nightmare. We had asked for adjacent rooms and got rooms that were on different floors, which was unacceptable with us having 3 kids. They would not let us cancel the reservation without a penalty, so I decided to just suck it up and deal with it. But staying in a hotel should not feel like a prison sentence. My first look at our 3rd floor room reminded me of prison. It was small, dark, with a tiny window and hard floors and tiny bathroom. I felt claustrophobic in it. The 2nd room with a kind sized bed was bigger, but the views out of the window were horrible. I am going to try to attach a photo so you can see it. Pros: (I tried really hard to think of good things to say) The building was sturdy and the walls were thick. The sink bowl was pretty. The lobby had interesting decor. That about sums up the good stuff. Cons: No towel rack or counter space in the tiny bathroom. No shampoo, conditioner, lotion or kleenex. The towels were flimsy and too few (we got 4 small towels for a family of 5) and no hand towels, no washcloths, etc. As I mentioned before, NO ELEVATOR! If you have a lot of heavy luggage and a 5th floor room, this will kill you, destroy your back, give you tennis elbow, put you in a bad mood, etc. The 4th floor room we were in had small windows with ugly black curtains, which makes no sense in an already dark room. I went to the window to look out and realized why the curtains were black. They were intended to block the hideous view of industrial waste. I took some photos of it. Our rooms were freezing cold, and the only way to reach the temp control was to stand on top of the tv table and risk breaking your neck. The other option would have been to rent a ladder. Hiking down all of those stairs to bother the one guy working there did not seem like something I felt like doing. The floors were not carpeted, seemed like concrete. If you took a shower (the shower handle fell off when we tried to use it) then you would inevitably track water all over the concrete floor because there was nothing to absorb the water. If you wear contact lenses, or want to brush your teeth, or put on makeup, etc, you will not be able to do it in the bathroom because there is no counter. Just a sink.

We HAD paid- our cards were charged in December! After arguing with her she suddenly found that we had paid. So after we protested more about being bumped out, we were told it was a comparable hotel in a nice area near good restaurants. We were told that we would be shown multiple rooms and could pick the one we wanted. They agreed to pay our taxi to the new hotel and when the taxi came he had no idea where it was, hint #1 Pop Art was not great. After driving around for awhile and many calls from the driver we pull up to a gated door with no name outside and the receptionist waving us down! We go in to find what is best described as a Youth Hostel. The receptionist then informs us that they only have 1 room available and it sleeps 8 and shares a bathroom! Mind you we paid $125 to stay at Casablanca and now are being told that we have to share a room and bathroom! We proceed to tell her that we are not staying here. There were multiple groups of teens and 20 somethings coming in and out and another couple who were also bumped from Casablanca and they were not happy either. Our husbands asked to use the restroom and she takes a key for what is the room that we would be staying him and leads them to that bathroom. There is no public restroom. The room had 2 sets of twin bunk beds and a set of queen bunk beds and 1 bathroom. The beds had not blankets, just a bottom sheet. No TV, decorations, no night stands, lamps, nothing! the neighborhood was way off the beaten path, which in San Juan is shady. There were no restaurants nearby. I felt bad for the receptionist as it was not her fault. She called Casablanca and they told her it was a mix up and they would make arrangements for us to stay elsewhere. So we waited for over an hour for this to happen and were told it would be the Howard Johnsons which is an even bigger dump. We told the receptionist to call her back at Casablanca and get a different place and that is when she stopped answering the phone. We then started looking for other places ourselves. We told the Pop Art lady to call Casablanca and tell them to refund our money and we would find our own place to stay. Still no answer.

My priorities are, in order: cleanliness, location, price and amenities, like free breakfast. It was clean, the location is fantastic in old San Juan, the price was excellent, and it had a very modest table-service continental breakfast included. But, echoing what others have said in earlier reviews, here's stuff you need to know before you choose this place over pricier ones in the old town area, or go with something along the Condado beach row. This hotel is 5 stories tall and there are no elevators, so you might have a long climb. Worse, there's no one assigned to help with your bags, making the climb to your room quite a workout, especially around the narrow, winding staircase. The people in front of us insisted that someone help them with baggage and, after a delay, a guy in scruffy jeans showed up, but clearly it's not a service they provide. That surprised me because I read so many comments giving them low ratings partly because of this fact, coupled with there being no elevator. Obviously, they can't do much about an elevator, but they certainly would boost comments if they offered baggage service. Another downside is noise, varying greatly depending on bar activity. We were there Saturday night, and it was LOUD. One side of the building that apparently had been open, has been enclosed with several stories of large glass panels, creating an atrium. The sounds of partying echo very loudly upward. The majority of rooms seem to surround the atrium, and I've read that rooms facing the street can encounter lots of late night street noise. We anticipated this negative, brought earplugs, and slept well, but others have rated it unacceptable for noise reasons. We had no problems with the hot water, as some others have, but we didn't place a lot of demand on it. The employees were fine, neither solicitous nor surly. Finally, they don't seem well organized. While we were checking in, one of the couples that had checked in ahead of us came back to complain that the room hadn't been made up. In our case, they had our reservation, but tried to charge me for the night, though I had pre-paid it last September. I knew the date and amount of my payment, and they quickly admitted their error, but it conveys sloppy management. In fact, they operate from a laptop as they sit at a table, with reservation printouts next to them, and disappear behind a curtain a couple of times with each reservation. Comes across as amateurish and drawn out. If you're using this hotel for a pre-cruise stay, make sure what pier your ship uses. We had thought it was Old San Juan piers, just a few blocks walk from the hotel, but our ship used the Pan American Pier, a $15-$20 taxi ride away. Bottom line is if you can live with the downsides for a short stay, the location is wonderful, the price is very reasonable, it's clean, and you're in a centuries-old building with lots of character and charm.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cQuaint and nice decor but noisy\u201d", "Author": "Spacebabe77", "ReviewID": "UR125413894", "Content": "Stayed here for one night after our cruise.

So I cannot say this was a \"bad\" experience.....but as far as getting what you pay for....That might be a whole different story....A friend and I took a last minute weekend excursion down to Puerto Rico for a weekend. We had booked a room that was supposed to have a terrace, and and extra bed.....we did NOT get this room with a terrace, nor did we get the extra bed...which was fine as the one bed we did have was more than large enough to fit both of us, and we had no qualms about sleeping next to each other...But we DID pay for these features, so it would have been nice for us to have been compensated in some way...The staff was very friendly, so there was definitely not a problem with that.. The hotel does offer brunch of some sort, but I did not eat there at all so perhaps a different review might have something to say on that matter... One night, we had a small termite community wander in thru the window...but like most termites...they tend to venture out the same way they came in...so that fortunately was not such a disastor, but it easily could have been... All in all, the hotel is conveniently located in the center of old San Juan, right in the mix of everything.....if you want beach, you must have a car, or take a taxi out of old San Juan to the neighboring town of Isla Verde...about 10 dollars and approximately 5 miles away...definitely not the end of the world....So a good hotel, just not great, and a bit overpriced for what it is...I would entertain staying there again...but would most likely try to find something different... *Also on a side note, make sure to visit El Yunque National Park and go visit the waterfalls...this was a highlight for me...it can be magical if you go SUPER early in the morning...get there around 7 or 8am and you will have the waterfall and much of the rainforest to yourself...go closer to 10 or 11am, and the tour buses will have dropped off about 100 people...thus cheapening the experience..

He proceeded to lead us up an alley that was crowded with people drinking and partying outside a nightclub. He guided us into D'House hotel which was located directly across from this nightclub. It was obvious in the lobby it was not of the same quality. He told us that the owner would give us a room in the back of the hotel so we would not be disturbed by the noise. He quickly left saying he couldn't do anything more for us and if we wanted to complain we could talk to the manager in the morning. We were then told that we had the last room which was directly over the nightclub and felt like you were in the center of the dance floor. I called Priceline to try to get a relocation but after over an hour on the phone gave up as it was midnight. We were awake until 5am when the noise finally subsided. The rep from Priceline said they would talk to the management because in the event that a hotel overbooks, the expectation by Priceline is that they find alternative accommodation at the same star rating. Casablanca is rated as a 3 star by Priceline, the D'House Hotel-had not been rated by their system-so below a 1 star. In fact they did not even deal with them. D'House was rundown and dirty, the air conditioning did not work properly and the noise level was unbearable. I would never book with Hotel Casablanca because they do not honor your reservations appropriately.

We were first given a room with no windows and upon going back to reception they moved us to a \"suite\" which had a lovely old world charm overlooking the street. However that evening we discovered there was no hot water in the suite. We made several requests to the front desk staff and were told they were looking into it. At midnight the clerk let us know that he \" is not a plumber and cant fix it\" so he gave us a key for a vacant room down the hall and told us to shower in there for the night. We did. Next morning we again mentioned it to the front desk and he said the plumber was looking into it today. We were out of the hotel all day sight seeing and upon return were told by different desk staff that it had been fixed, yet we found that there was still no hot water. Upon checking with the front desk they advised us that they had done all they can do. When questioned as to how we were to have a shower with no hot ( or even warm water) they stated they didn't know and that they did not have a room we could use to shower in as the hotel was full, and there was nothing more to be done. This was after several inquiries and being told they were working on it. At this point the \"nice\" front desk staff became rude and dismissive to us. When pushed to solve the issue they finally gave us a key to a suite 4 floors above, that the guests had not checked in yet, and told to hurry up and have a shower and return the key so that the new guests could check in. The next morning upon checking out the front desk tried to re-charge us for our hotel stay (despite being paid in full on check in) as they had no record of payment made. I produced the credit card slip as proof of payment and they photo-copied it. I was told that they were going to give us a discount due to the inconvenience if no hot water and all the hassles, and that they would call that day to advise us once the manager arrived. We left the hotel with our other guests to head off on our trip to the BVI. It has now been 2 weeks and there has been no call, no discount, no contact and they have charged the full price of the room to the card. I can accept some of the inconveniences that occurred but not the lack of follow up and or serious commitment to customer service when working in the hospitality industry. During my time there it became evident that there are comparable hotels in the same areas as this one that appeared to have better reviews on trip advisor.

I usually look on Trip Adivsor first, and sometimes I go directly to a cities visitor website. At first I booked a room at the Howard Johnson hotel, and we did see that hotel when we were there, but did not go inside. But I changed my mind, because the CasaBlanca was less $ and just had a great history. It was built for Ponce de Leon, though he never got the chance to live there. That in and of itself was enough to pique my interest. I chose a suite, and it was huge! Had we only had the bedroom side, I'm afraid it would have been a little cramped, not terribly, but there would not have been much room to do anything but the usual things you do in a hotel room (sleep). We were going to cruise the following day and had to rearrange our bags since I was smuggling a lot of alcohol that I could pack in my checked luggage for the airlines, but needed to transfer so the cruise ship would not scrutinize the contents of the \"checked\" bags. The point is we had lots of room to spread out, there was a huge antique wood table and a couch and chairs in the second room. Then we also had a balcony, that was really nice. Originally I wanted to have our anniversary dinner at Marmalade, and discovered it is directly across the street. When we arrived it was hot, October 22, 2011. Hot and humid. We took a taxi from the airport. We enjoyed the drive, it was not far, and you could tell when you were going into Old San Juan. The streets are very narrow, so it is a constant challenge for the drivers. We hopped out of the taxi, no place to park, and drug our luggage into the lobby. There were 5 or 6 parties waiting to check in, the lobby is a little small, but had lots of chairs and couches to sit on. The artwork in the lobby was plentiful and eclectic. I did not mind waiting at all. Once it was our turn, the check in was quick, and one of the guys took my husband's maxed out suitcase and threw it over his shoulder, then picked up my larger piece and hauled it up two flights of stairs while we followed behind. I could not believe it. We handled our luggage on our own on the way out, it was not hard going down, it might have taken a few trips had he not helped us. That is worth mentioning, since it is one of the only drawbacks. Once we checked out the room, which was nice and cool, we explored the rest of the hotel. We also explored the roof. We were tickled by so many things. There were big tubs on the roof. They looked like the tubs from Cialis commercials, even bigger. No idea what they did with them. There were 6 or 8 of them. The views from the top were cool, you could see the water on both sides of the island, the fort and all of the nearby shops, restaurants and hotels. We took a walk and got hot and sweaty, but it was fun to explore. Then we went back to Casablanca to get ready for our anniversary dinner. The bathroom was okay sized, we took turns, not enough room for two people to be in there. When we went to the lobby to exit, we took some cool photos, and the staff went out of their way to move furniture for a better pics. When we returned from the great evening, I was so tired, we went to the room and I crashed, but Larry watched the Cardinals win the 3 game of the World Series. He said he could hear people on the streets until about 11:00 p.m., but he was not disturbed by it. I woke up once and went out on the balcony in the middle of the night and early in the morning. Earlier there were so many people walking around in and out of the shops and restaurants. Now, nobody. Maybe the street cleaners, but no tourists. We were sad to leave even though we were bound for the cruise. To me, this hotel was quaint, romantic and plain fun. It is more like a European hotel. I know a lot of people give bad reviews. I'd rather stay in a unique place rather than a chain ANY day. I certainly recommend this hotel, but I'd add that upgrading to a suite is really the way to go.

We stayed in room 5F, which had a nice wooden shuttered window that overlooked the side/back of the building. It was quiet. The couple we traveled with had 4G, which was directly below us and had it's own terrace. The lobby is nicely decorated in Moroccan themed accessories, with comfortable places to hang out and drink mojitos. We thought their bar was a bit expensive, but during happy hour they have 2 for 1, so two drinks are about 10 dollars. The hotel is near one of the only salsa clubs left in town, and is easy walking distance to the pier, San Cristobel, El Morro, and other areas of interest. The front desk staff was helpful and friendly, suggesting places to eat, callilng taxis, and keeping our luggage safe until we left on our cruise. Now, the downside. Our bed had only two decorative pillows. They were tiny throw pillows decorated with sequins. We ended up using the pillows from the small couch instead to sleep with. Our bed had no comforter, just a small blanket. Normally this would be ok in a tropical climate, but they had pre-cooled the room (16 degrees celcius!) and it was freezing. In addition, after a poor night's sleep, our room had no hot water. We tried everything, and ended up taking a cold shower. Our friends had a similar issue, and apparently there is a \"magic\" position somewhere in the middle of the knob that produces warm/hot water. We did try and call the front desk multiple times to attempt to address these issues, but they did not answer both the room phone or cell phone calls. Our traveling companions, in room 4G, had full sunlight streaming in their faces at 5:30am due to no curtains on the patio door facing their bed. They had bed pillows and a comforter, however. Finally, the rooftop terrace is under construction, with floating 2 x 4s that have nails sticking out. The soaking tubs appear to be disconnected from the draining system, as adding water creates a lake under the tubs. In addition, there were no plugs, so water will not stay in the tubs. We considered the rooftop terrace a total bust. Overall, this was an ok place to stay for one night before our cruise left port. Sure, I would have liked a real bed pillow and hot water, but we piad $90/night, so I feel as if I can't be that picky. I wouldn't pay much more than that however; this is not a high-end boutique hotel, as they attempt to bill themselves.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Teaneck, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat atmosphere.......

A tip for the traveller, its a lot easier for a hotel to control bugs when the floors are hard surface, so obviously I really like hard surface floors. The first time I stayed on the 4th floor with a little private terrace at the back; it was ok but the outdoor chair was falling apart. The second time I decided to stay on the second floor in one of the two front rooms \"close to the party\" ... and indeed there was a loud and boisterous party on Saturday night right across the street in a bar / restaurant. And I loved it! Noise and all! I certainly don't go on vacation to sleep on Saturday night! Hello! This hotel may be in the heart of Old San Juan, but the party was definitely the heartbeat!

The beds are comfortable but the comforters are very thin. There was no closet in the room only two dressers which smelled very musty. The bathroom was very very small. The shower had no soap dish or any ledge to place soap or shampoo bottles. The water in the shower was either very hot or very cold with nothing in between. There were many annoyances wth our room. Our bed sheets were changed only once in 5 nights, several nights our dirty towels were taken but no new towels were left and we had to call. Our last night we had clean towels but no clean wash cloths. During the first three days of our stay our TV did not have any receiption. We complained several times and were told the hotel was waiting for a techniction. Finally we received TV but with not access to any local channels. One night our air conditioner failed and the room was very hot until morning. When the air did work it made the room so damp that everything in the room felt wet including our sheets and clothing. The batteries in both set of remotes for the TV were dead. The worst thing of all was the noise at night. One night there was a loud party in one of the rooms on our floor until 3:00am and nothing was done about it. During both Friday and Saturday nights there is a nightclub directly across the street from the hotel which plays very loud music onto the street until 4:00 am. During those nights it is impossible to sleep with the loud music. We also had no shampoo provided to us during our entire stay. Everyday we asked for shampoo and everyday we were told they wore out. Our stay was to include a contnental breakfast. The breakfast only constisted of ceral, toast, or a small danish. I chose the danish and it was literally one inch by one inch and the coffee was watery. We ate else where.

In fact, though my partner and I went to Puerto Rico mainly to lounge on the beach in Vieques, we decided to spend two nights in San Juan just because we were so excited about this hotel. The hotel is centrally located in Old San Juan. As soon as we walked in the vibe was great: super bright, funky lobby, and the whole place smells absolutely beautiful. The room they took us to was really very beautiful and well decorated, but it had no balcony-- a disappointment after we had paid more for a room with a balcony. Then I went downstairs to complain, and we had to wait to get shuffled to another room. This room had a balcony and even a nicely appointed sitting room, though with no view, and it meant we got downgraded to a double bed, rather than a queen, which is what we had ordered and would have preferred. That said, we loved the aesthetic and the vibe. We had brought a bottle of wine and particularly enjoyed lounging in the living room drinking it. There were numerous other little things that were off. The TV didn't work; our room was without hot water for the entire time we were there. We paid $130 a night for the room, which, considering all the numerous problems, was ridiculous. I was particularly teed off that we didn't even get hot water for the price, and the staff seemed put upon that we wanted a discount.

I also saw other hotel guests complaining to the hotel staff about this. And finally, at about 7:00 am on Sunday morning, there was a huge crowd of raucous people in the lobby singing and yelling.

Many have been mentioned in other reviews: no closet, no towel racks, poor breakfast service, inconsistent housekeeping, no remote for AC (which was resolved) needed help figuring out the cable, noisy due to the echo chamber created by the atrium. We stayed a total of five nights. My biggest complaint is the noise factor created by the hotel itself--it's the deal-breaker for me. On Friday, the hotel played hard-driving rock till 11:45 p.m. The staff did turn it down and move the speakers when I called at 11:15. All other evenings, no music, so it was quiet. The quietest rooms are probably those those ending in d, e, f, and h. All others face the street or share a wall with the atrium. B is close to the stairs, which are noisy. We were in 3G, and had no issues with street noise, but it shares a wall with the atrium. Breakfast is a disorganized mess. They couldn't keep coffee flowing or breadand pastries stocked, and always ran out of clean cups silverware, etc. Save yourself the irritation and go to Siglo XX on the other side of the street for good coffee and basic breakfast. Treat yourself to breakfast at Hotel El Convento's restaurant at least one morning, too. It's served in a gorgeous open air courtyard and was so delicious! The staff were very friendly and helpful, and mostly made things right when we complained. They helped us with a car rental, too. Our first night, we were upgraded to the suite as our room had a leak issue. That lobby is stunning, and the rooms charmingly decorated. For the price and old building, I thought they were good-sized. With more attention to detail, this could be a truly great little hotel, one of those hidden gems--the location can't be beat.

The bathroom had only 2 bath towels no toiletries and there was no place to put our dop kit. The roof top tubs looked interesting but there was too much wood and construction debris to step over and around to get there. The front desk staff had other business that always seemed more important than their guests. The biggest problem was that while we were in San Juan it was very rainy. Upon returning from a day of sightseeing & a huge amount of rain we got to our room and found that someone had been in and picked up our bags off the floor. The rain water had come in off the roof and down the stairs and seeped under the wall and the door. There were towels in the hall against the wall of our room. In the morning when we woke there was at least an inch of water all over the floor and seeping up the bedspread. All of this took place and no one from the staff even acknowledged that there was a problem. Luckily we were checking out that morning so we tip toed through the water puddles and packed our bags.

First, the location is great. It's located on Fortaleza Street, right in the heart of Old San Juan and perfect for sightseeing. And if you like clubs, you're in luck, there's one next door that blasts music till dawn. For those of you who aren't night owls, bring earplugs. The room itself was very nice, if a bit smokey, complete with a balcony overlooking the street, a big comfortable bed, a highend Sylvania TV with Blueray player and a clean bathroom with a great shower. However, the TV didn't work, none of the cables were hooked up, and we had to wait hours for clean towels. When the towels finally arrived, they were hand towels. The rooftop patrio was great, outstanding views, bathtubs to soak in and comfortable chairs to relax in. The only problem was the unused lumber and construction equipment laying around everywhere. One aspect of the hotel that cannot be criticized is the lobby. Elegantly decorated with a Middle Eastern feel, the lobby has ornate furnishings, a bar and decorative paintings. Definitely a place to relax after a day of sightseeing. Our only dealing with the staff came at check in where a slight mixup over payment was quickly and politely resolved by the young man who helped us. Overall, the Casa Blanca is a tough hotel to review. There are many positives to speak of, but there are also negatives. And while it isn't the hotels fault a club is next door, it is something that needs to be mentioned. As far as the hotel's other deficiencies, I believe most were do to an inexperienced staff and the hotel's relative youth.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "GA!", "Title": "\u201cUnique hotel with great location.\u201d", "Author": "QueenOfTheRoad7", "ReviewID": "UR56817964", "Content": "Stayed at Casablanca for 3 nights in two different rooms.

That being said, it is still a charming and unique property. Staff does their best to satisfy. After checking in and getting to our room, 4 A, we heard a loud explosion and the electricity went out. A transformer next door had blown. Attempts to repair it caused a second transformer to go. No electricity from Friday afternoon until Saturday around 6pm. The hotel was not responsible for this, just general infrastructure issues. Sounds awful doesn't it? Imagine a Morrocan villa entirely lit by candle light. Even the stair case was filled with candles. Fortunately we had an outside room with a balcony to provide fresh air. I would recommend this to other travelers. The staff provided ice buckets full of ice for everyone, lots of candles, and opened the bar. It turned into a party on a street full of parties! Breakfast is included, and was a little tricky Saturday morning, but those who wished-were sent to another property for a full breakfast. We were happy with the juice and fresh pastries the staff brought in. When the power returned on Saturday night, staff had beer on ice for all and insisted on full refunds for everyone who had stayed the night. We had a great time, but we were out sightseeing on Friday afternoon and evening, as well as all day Saturday. Rooms are small, but this is a colonial building, we have found the same all over Central and South America. Decor is eclectic and arty. Bathroom was small but had a glass sink and Italian decorative mirror. We had satelite TV but didn't use it. WiFi worked fine as did the air when we had power. I chose this property based on TA reviews and the price point. It's perfect for staying in OSJ and not paying an arm and a leg. We chose to spend our dollars on the fabulous food and drink! Calle Fortaleza is a party no doubt about it. We were right over the street with our balconey open the first night. But I had read the reviews and brought ear plugs which made sleeping just fine. You are across the street from Marmalade the trendy new restaurant, and in the same block as the Parrot Club, Aquaviva, Tantra, etc. Location can't be beat. The free trolleys stop right down the block so you can get all the way out to El Morro without walking if you wish.
