The hotel has Bicycle rental - from 3 hours. We took the bikes and rode around the city like a real townspeople))) The hotel itself is located very conveniently - it is quiet expensive district centre. Near bus stop and trams. By bus 197 can be reached directly from the airport to the hotel (approximately 20 minutes). Near the hotel there is the van Gogh Museum, the Vondelpark and the Rijkmuseum.

Interestingly enough, on the times we met him as he was getting off work he was a very pleasant fellow. I just don't think he liked his night job very much.

Do not rent the quad room if going in warm weather, the night clerk (when off duty) told us it was the hottest room in the hotel...he wasn't kidding. They gave us a fan to use, but since you can only open one of the windows in this room it never really cooled down that much. All in all, I would stay here again if the weather was cool.

My husband & I had a double room - the only problem was that there was not enough room between the bed, the door & the wall to get our suitcases in so they had to be lifted (each one weighed about 22kg so was not an easy feat) over the end of the bed. However, the shower was hot & water pressure good - which counts for a lot. My sister's room was upgraded by the hotel on their own volition on checkin - her room was very large with oodles of room. One interesting feature was the fake chest of drawers. The downstairs coffeeshop/bar area was pleasant & the prices fair. Breakfast was good - but don't expect bacon & eggs, sausages etc. On offer were boiled eggs, pastries, bread for toast, cereals, cheeses, meats, juice & tea or coffee. The staff were very helpful & nothing was too much trouble. As we were lesving for a 2 week river cruise, we had the hotel order us a taxi to take us to the embarkation point. When we reached the wharf, the boat was not there & noone on any of the other boats knew where it was. However, out intrepid taxi driver dropped us off & then went searching for the boat, finding it on the other side of the river. he then came back & picked us up. The cruise company had not updated the website so the wrong embarkation point was listed. If all Amsterdam taxi drivers were like this one, then everyone would be smiling.

And I loved it! First of all, location is great. It is close to many museums, fashion district, restaurants, bars. Amsterdam, as a whole, is not that big of a city so we walked everywhere and used the public transportation on our last day only-going to to the Central Station to catch a train to Schiphol. Yet, the street is very quiet, residential. Second, the look and feel is so different. Like I said, it felt almost like you were staying in a museum :) Bathroom was updated, very new, modern and clean (if not very big, but I don't care about it). Complementary breakfast was nice. Nothing special, but it's good to have a meal to eat before you head out exploring the city. Complementary wifi is something that is very precious to me, very important-so loved that as well. Third, people are very nice. I got to notice that after I left (I don't interact much with people who work at hotels etc and consider myself extremely low maintenance). What happened is that I forgot my outlet adapter and my iphone charger. They send me an email before I even arrived back to the States to let me know and asked me if I want them to send it to me. They charged my credit card off course, but their attitude and personal service felt so genuine.

Fashionable shops are within the block. The staff are helpful and the continental breakfast is satisfying, served in a lovely dining room with excellent coffee and steamed milk. Bicycles are available to rent outside the front door. The great disappointment was the bedroom which was excruciatingly small and very shabby. Two small beds were pushed together, both mattresses were very uncomfortable, and there was just a hook to serve as a closet. Being 2 people with 2 suitcases, we couldn't open our suitcase and walk. The bathroom was very tiny as were the towels, but the shower had wonderful pressure and hot water. We were on the 4th floor/street side (canals are 2 blocks away) which was fairly quiet with the windows closed. There is an elevator (very slow, yet welcome) which is a bonus in this city. Many boutique hotels in Amsterdam were former houses and rooms tend to be small, however, as a seasoned traveler, this room was suited for one person only and , although clean, was in dire need of updating/remodeling. Since we had a jammed schedule, we didn't remain in the room much except to sleep. If you are planning a romantic get away or want to really rest, this would not be a good choice for the reasons stated above. There is no wifi throughout the hotel, although a public computer is located in the bar and its use is complimentary to guests. The way the screen is mounted, it's difficult to use and everyone can see what you are doing. It will be a much better hotel when the owners remodel and enlarge the rooms, replace the worn out mattresses, and update the decor.

Even then we had to sleep with the window open, but luckily the hotel is in a quiet area, and we didn't have any problem with street noise keeping us awake. We thought about switching hotels, but after checking with the other hotels on the street, we found they didn't have AC either. On the plus side, the hotel is in a fabulous location for museum hopping and near several tram stops. The hotel staff was very courteous, and we had no problem with the free wi-fi. Also the breakfast was substantial and served in a beautiful room, and they even provided an early breakfast for us on our departure day.

Expensive area of Amsterdam with lovely 1900s buildings which enchanted me - my favorite period of architecture. The welcome at the hotel was great, truly friendly, the room and bed good and directions where to eat excellent. After a good meal near the Concertgebouw I had a good night's sleep and a great array of food on offer for breakfast next morning. Next day I set off for the Rijksmuseum which is 2 minutes away. Pay to go in and find Rembrandts in number and other Dutch painters. Don't forget the Rembrandthuis Museum, truly interesting and the Museum Van Loon which is a beautiful house with beautiful contents - he founded the east India Company. There are many other things to see but I wished to see painting and I had to take into account the Rijksmuseum is partly closed for renovation. Took in a short lunchtime concert (Concertgebouw Orchestra) at the Concertgebouw (5 minutes away). Found a super food market, underground,across the road from the concert building, to get some supper (breakfast only at hotel) for after evening concert. Concert was what I had come for really and it was brilliant. Fantastic orchestra. There is classical music each evening, varying orchestras, and the Concertgebouw has a cafe and, before performances, two bars. Next day I wandered around the city which is so picturesque and full of interesting museums and small shops - a street devoted to antiques which is great, as are the buildings they are in. Canals and boats are great and a photo opportunity at every step, provided you look out for bikes, seemingly on every inch!! Plenty of places to eat, small and larger (plenty of ham and cheese too!). Try the pancakes - wow! A canal trip is a must. The hotel arranged a ticket for me and it was really worth the reduction I got and the trip was fascinating. The commentary is spoken in Dutch and English and French, so you do not miss anything and it does not interfere with your enjoyment. Photo opportunities again, either at the open rear of the boat or by opening a window and photographing through. After hours of walking each day I was ready for food, lovely, friendly Italian place nearby and an Indonesian also. The hotel staff are brilliant, so pleasant and informative. I would certainly recommend anyone to stay there. It is reasonable and within easy walking distance of famous museums, etc. and the city itself. There are trams on a very regular basis to get across town should you wish, two/three minutes away at the end off the street near the Rijksmuseum. For a rest there is the nearby park and for Bond Street type shopping there is the next street. All in all a great stay and a very nice small hotel with a very nice lot of people working there and staying there. Well recommended. Remember though that there is a great deal of walking and on brick pavers, and around the churches, cobbles, so wear sensible shoes - be attractive, I did not see many pairs of trainers! Dress smartly for concerts and larger restaurants. Advice - taxis are expensive, especially from the airport; get a return shuttlebus ticket. Cannot arrange to go to your hotel until t get on the bus and explain where wish to go and it will be done. Can arrange a pick-up to airport from hotel. I was lucky - no bus available so had a taxi at the same cost and was at the airport far faster than anticipated.

LOCATION. This hotel is situated on a quiet street, with some other hotels, and right at the end of the block is the Rijksmuseum. If you walk just a little farther, there is the Van Gogh museum. Both are top-notch and the Rijks is a must-see. There is a park on the other side of the block, near the Van Gogh museum, and I saw there was ice-skating going on. Very, very appealing. Restaurants (I recommend Canaleto) as well as luxury-brand stores are also close by. If you cross the canal going towards the center of the city, there are more inviting (that is, less elite) shopping and eating opportunities. In short, the location is ideal -- a 30-minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal and the Anne Frank museum. Not good if you have tons of luggage, I suppose, but I was able to walk all over town with my 3-days worth of clothes, etc. without too much pain. Amsterdam seems planned-out with pedestrians and bicyclists in mind. It was great, and easy to figure out even for a first-timer. 2. SAFETY. I am 22 years old, female, and a solo traveller. It was my first time in The Netherlands, so I was very happy to see I would be completely safe staying at this hotel. You give the front desk your keys whenever you leave, and there is someone there 24/7. They have a camera to see who approaches the entrance, so when you come back, they buzz you in and there your keys are, waiting for you. You are allowed one guest, if you specify whom beforehand (I stayed in the small, single room -- perhaps you get more guests if you are with a larger party, in a larger room?), so nobody comes or goes that they don't know about. There was, however, a door from my room leading outside into a courtyard, which I initially found a little alarming; but I simply locked it and drew the heavy curtain over it at night. 3. VALUE. This was not a very expensive, super-fancy hotel, but it was very professional, and had a very homey feel. They all speak perfect English, of course, and like all the Dutch I met on my trip, they were friendly and kind. My small one-person room was equipped with a television with approximately 20 free channels with a few in English, wardrobe, nightstand/bedside lamp, desk, single bed; the bathroom was likewise very basic. There is a shower but no tub, and a hair-dryer provided. The only soap that you get is from a dispenser on the wall, like at a public toilet -- there is one above the sink and one in the shower to be used on your body AND your hair. This I found slightly unusual, but the only hotels I have ever stayed at before have been in the US. Overall, no big deal. Bring your own stuff if you are fussy. As far as the appearance/layout of the hotel, it is perfectly respectable in every way -- small, but very nice. 4. FOOD. There is a very good breakfast upstairs from 7:30am to 9:00am. You can help yourself to cereals and milk, tea, breads, croissants, eggs, etc. They will offer you coffee as well. Nothing too elaborate, but a very nice dining room and pleasant service. Downstairs is a bar with alcohol, some sodas, and some minimal snacks (candy bars and potato chips). 5. NOISE. If you stay in one of the two downstairs rooms, you will probably hear people thumping on the stairs all hours of the morning. They are slightly steep steps, so this is likely why. However, the neighborhood itself is virtually silent (I stayed in February, so this is based on a winter experience -- it may be different in the summer when more people are on vacation). 6. Was there anything that went wrong with my stay? Well, the pen on my desk was quite useless. The phone in my room was not connected until I mentioned it to the front desk, but they quickly remedied that. Oh, and I started out with two pillows, until one disappeared the next day, which was disappointing, as I like having two pillows to sleep with. In conclusion, I will certainly stay here again.

I stayed different room each day. My first day, I stayed in a small room, however, it was a perfect size for me. As I saw in someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to Amsterdam to spend too much time in your hotel room, so the size of the room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter to me. My second day, I moved to a big room. It was too big for me, and I could switch the room with someone else, but again, the size of the room was not a big deal to me. In both room, I felt comfortable. The rooms were very clean and neat. Breakfast was included in price. There was a plenty of great choice. Laundry service was available. The reception was open 24 hours, and the hotel entrance was secured. The receptionist held my luggage after I checked out. I had some errands to do near by, so being able to leave my stuff was super helpful for me. There was a bar/lounge, so I spent some relaxing time and chit-chat with other travelers. There was a free computer available in this lounge, and this made my life so easy. The greatest experience in this hotel was, all of the hotel staffs (including house keepers) were very helpful and friendly. As I mentioned in the front, I was stuck in Amsterdam for the personal reason (lost my passport and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fly back), so I had no choice but just had to stay there. First it was very difficult for me, and I actually cried for a few times, but I could change my attitude positive, because of the hotel staffs. They were so helpful and warm hearted. They listened to my stories and could comfort me enough. That was what I needed, especially when I felt so alone and nervous and stressed out. I truly felt that they cared about me.

I was not disappointed. Here's the highlights: Yes, the rooms are small. If you are visiting Amsterdam and are spending a lot of time in your room, you don't understand the point of travel. The room is small, but it's comfortable for what you need - a place to sleep. I was in Room 1a, which is small but also less expensive. Bed, desk, wardrobe, bathroom, TV, and a window overlooking the back yard. Plus free wifi. That's all I need. There's no A/C, but the window gave a slight breeze and I wasn't uncomfortable (actually a little chilly when I woke up this morning). Yes, the way the shower is set up, you will probably get some water on the floor. Big deal. Make sure you put down the bathmat first. The rooms were very clean and well maintained, as was the whole hotel. They run a class act here. The stairs were steep (that's normal here), but manageable, and they have an elevator, so don't worry. Hotels in Amsterdam are very VERY (did I say \"very\") expensive. You would pay less for a nicer, large hotel in the US, but that doesn't help if where you want to be is Amsterdam. For the price, this is a good hotel. You can do everything in two days here, so suck it up and deal with the cost. I didn't have the included breakfast - wanted to get out and see the city, so I can't tell you one way or the other. There are plenty of bakeries in the city, so if you don't like the hotel's offering, it's not hard to get a simple breakfast while you are out. That's what I did, because I didn't want to waste a minute. The desk staff were universally nice, helpful, and their English was impeccable. In fact, I was fine everywhere in the city. You hear just about every language on Earth walking around Amsterdam, so everyone uses English as common ground. The desk staff really were wonderful - they helped me find my route back to the airport in the morning, and pointed out on a map all the places I wanted to see. Can't say enough for them.

For a city as busy and alive as Amsterdam, it was a real bonus to find a friendly hotel in such a quiet location. As I live in a very quiet rural area, this was really important to me. The Aalders is in a residential part of the city, yet very close to everything. A few minutes walk will take you to the Rijksmuseum, van Gogh museum and Concertgebouw in one direction, and Vondel Park and Leidseplein in the other. The trams in Hobbemastraat are just at the top of the street, about 200 yards away. They will take you through the city centre and reach Amsterdam Centraal Station in about ten minutes. My room was advertised as a small single room, but was sufficiently spacious and more than adequate for my needs. You don't come to Amsterdam to spend too much time in your hotel room anyway! It was comfortable, warm and kept scrupulously clean by staff I didn't see - I was never disturbed. The en-suite bathroom and shower were of a reasonable size, and again very clean. Single hotel rooms don't often have the best views, but this room looked out on the garden with its spring flowers and magnolia tree in bloom. Breakfast was buffet style in a large first floor room. There was plenty of choice with cereals, cheese, ham, rolls, fruit, etc. Tea or coffee was provided quickly by friendly staff, who soon learnt that I always have coffee for breakfast. You were neither hurried nor fussed over, making the meal an enjoyable experience. Although the hotel does not provide dinners, I found several restaurants within easy walking distance. The reception is manned 24 hours a day, with the hotel entrance having a buzzer operated security door. It therefore felt really safe. In the bar / lounge there was a computer freely available for guests to check e-mails, etc. I found all the staff courteous, friendly and helpful. They seemed genuinely interested in their guests and were a mine of information. A minor problem with my suitcase on my last morning was instantly solved, much to my relief.

There are places to eat nearby - ideal for a single female traveller - and it is easy to walk to the central attractions too. The rooms are all non smoking which is a big plus in Amsterdam though smoking is allowed in the bar where typically the receptionist was smoking all evening while watching the football - only downside from my point of view.

When we said we were going to find somewhere else to stay, she said we needed to check out on time, since the room had to be made up. Remember, we had reserved the room for 5 nights so clearly no one else was staying in the room. Overall, for the amount this hotel wants you to pay, it is a TERRIBLE value. The staff is cold and not at all accomidating. STAY AWAY, and you will have a much better vacation.", "Date": "August 13, 2002"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Aalders", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d237585-Reviews-Hotel_Aalders-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$119 - $276*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Jan Luijkenstraat 13-15</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1071 CJ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "237585", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/d9/80/d980cd18fa6d512e2d5ce44000a58ad923large.jpg"}}
