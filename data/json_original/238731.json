I will short my story now but I will tell you there were a lot of Lies, attempts to find excuses, attempts to trick us and only after 15 min of talking loud and getting angry he gave us some of the money back (and we payed for a room with shared bathroom). oh and it's VERY loud at morning!!! ** SO BE CARFUL FROM THIS PLACE - GOOD LOCATION , BAD ATTITUDE, NOISY!! ** p.s - when I got out of the cold water shower we found out there is no Heating \u05dfin the rooms - this option is blocked in A.C remote!!", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "Shar1906", "ReviewID": "UR116950160", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Paris for four nights during June. We hadn't booked anywhere to stay in Barcelona we just turned up. Hotel Paris was the cheapest Hotel/Hostel we could find and it was in a very good area, on Les Rambles The service was very good when we got there and the receptionist was very helpful. The room was basic but nice. very clean and comfortable. The hostel was near everything and we walked right into the hustle and bustle of Barcelona and its nightlife. You couldn't hear the nightlife from our room. The only thing i would have to say is that you could hear people coming in from there nights out every so often, but it was hardly noticeable.

The negatives were: at the time the lobby getting painted, so the paint fumes were annoying. The guy working the front desk was not friendly at all and no elevator, which normally wouldn't be so bad but these were unusually steep, narrow stairs and we were on the 4th floor, I think, or maybe 3rd...anyway, after a night of drinks, going up and down the stairs sucks...but overall, a decent price in relation to the great location.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ipswich", "Title": "\u201cCheap and very cheerful\u201d", "Author": "DoveIpswich", "ReviewID": "UR64547479", "Content": "Hostal Paris is in a brilliant location just off La Ramblas, close to the metro and the Place de Reial & Catalunya.

We were slightly chocked already when we entered the room - it had no windows! It was a humid warm burrow with a false \"window\" to some kind of an internal well. But ok, we came to visit Barcelona, not to sit in the hotel room, so we did not spend too much time thinking about that. During the night we couldn't sleep, it was too warm (not working air-co) and too loud (you can here people talking in the corridor, slamming doors, etc), but the worst we were scratching most of the time. I thought (oh, how naive one can be) it's nervous itching, some kind of psychological reaction to the first night in not known place. Unfortunately, in the morning we discovered bugs on our sheets! We identified them as bed-bugs (brrrr), later we've learnt there were also fleas. We packed our staff immediately to change the hotel. But at the reception desk another nasty surprise - we booked the hotel via barcelona30 website and pre-paied by a credit card a certain percentage of the total price which gave almost 90 Euros. When you book the hotel, it is suggested you pre-pay a part of the accomodation price. U-huh, as we've learnt aaalllll 90 Euros was the fee for the booking service! and we still needed to pay extra 80 Euros for the spent night there. I'm still to write a formal complaint to the barcelona30 company, and I will not hesitate to take legal steps, as it's simple cheating. All together an awful adventure. And as for the bugs, we were so badly bitten, that we needed a dermatological assistance - we are still taking anti-alergic pills and apply a special ointment. I wish I have taken photos of red spots on my feet and swallowed wrists so I could send them to the hotel.

The price seemed reasonable and after reading reviews about the hostal it seemed quite nice. But it was absolutely awful. It is extremely old and very ugly. The rooms are dirty, the bed sheets very used and the towels have holes. The soap in the bathroom belonged to another hotel. The bed had bugs and and me and my friend were bitten while trying to sleep during the 1st and only night (as we booked another hotel just 20\u20ac more and on the Ramblas with breakfast and a fantastic room with a wonderful view and soundproof windows). The noise you can hear in the Hostal Paris is the same as if you were outside, or the people talking, screaming, laughing and cars, ambulances were inside your room making a huge noise until the morning. The 2 people at the reception of the hostal do not know how to smile (nor even understand any other language beside Spanish) The night receptionist told us when we said we were leaving the next day that we did not have to pay anything more as we had already paid 87\u20ac. The next morning when we checked out, the lady at the reception screamed at us saying that we had to pay an extra 53,50\u20ac (after already having paid 87\u20ac) for one night. Said that the 87\u20ac was barcelona30 commission, but that\u2019s not what barcelona30 said before, never had they said that the room was 53\u20ac50 per night (they said 59\u20ac) it was a horrible 1st night in Barcelona (a fantastic city that we were visiting for the 1st time). It is a dreadful hostal, horrible rooms, very unfriendly and badly educated people who work there. I do not recommend this hostel to anyone.
