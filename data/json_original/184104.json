Although I had all my information of my visa card to book a room I didnt have my physical card on me because I misplace it. I felt it would be a problem when I get there so I called the front desk to Radisson and the monotone person said that when I get here I can pay in any form of payment and it would not be a problem. Here is when the problems started happening.I asked for a name so that if there was any problems I would at least have the name of who I was talking to BUT he didn't want to give it to me. He just said \"uh...just come to the front and we will help you\" \"yes but I would like your name just in case I have a problem\". This went on for a while in 2 different phone conversations and I simply hung up. Me and my boyfriend decided to come in separately so when I got there and told them that I didn't have my card they told me they could not let me in the room and so I waited. Once my Boyfriend got there the dispute started happening. I explained them that I spoke to someone over the phone (who wouldn't give me there name) that it was okay if we didn't have the visa card but to pay on a different form. They said they couldn't do anything. And the guy MOCKED me saying in a smug voice \"Our associates would never decline to give out there name\". Well buddy they did so you should re-train them because you obviously didn't do a good job. Seeing that I was very upset and angry they called us back to the front and said they will give us the room. I feel like that they were afraid of the bad review we might give them from booking.com. The Room The hallways smell and the room was stuffy and the washroom was NOT clean. The ice machine was not working on our floor so we had to get ice from 2 floors down. It doesn't stop there it gets better. They changed the clock an hour ahead on us so when we did wake up to the alarm clock we noticed it was different on our phone. You want your guest to leave that bad? Why don't you just change your bloody check out time. The cleaning lady that came and opened our door without knocking twice!!! the first time my boyfriend said we're leaving at 11 on the dot and she said \"ok\" and came back an hour later when I was half naked saying sorry sorry.

When I told them it had already been several hours, they offered a portable fan and suggested I open the window. Facing the highway, the noise was too much to keep the window open all night.

My husband and I had to stay in Toronto this past weekend for a wedding. We have always had good luck using Priceline, so after deciding on the North Toronto area for our choice location we bid $75 per night for 3 nights and we received the Radisson Toronto East. After reading the other reviews I was VERY nervous and upon pulling up to the hotel and its dated exterior I became even more nervous. But once inside the lobby I felt better. The staff was extremely friendly and quick, within minutes we were checked in and on our way to room 902. From reading other Tripadvisor reviews I was aware that the 8th and 9th floors were the \"Executive Levels\" that had been more recently remodled than the rest of the hotel. On our way up to the 9th floor, the elevator stopped at 7 and even the carpet on that floor looked disgusting, but thats all I can comment on. Our room was nice, albeit small, but clean. We had a king size bed, flat screen tv, desk and chair etc. The room also had a coffee maker and a fridge. The Radisson hotels are equipped with sleep number beds which is a neat feature. Unfortunately the bed did not work. The last Radisson we stayed at in Kitchener had a working bed, but this one did not. My husband found the bed to be much too hard for his liking. The bathroom was very small. The floor would get soaked when you had a shower but the counter top was solid surface and the bathroom was clean enough. There was no exhaust fan and the lighting was terrible. But there was a hairdryer. So overall it was just good. We stayed for 3 nights and we never used the maid service, we just asked for more towels which we receievd promptly. Parking here was good at $7/night - that is the area average. The fitness centre was very limited, but for cardio it does the job. The easy access to the 401 and the DVP was perfect. For the $75 priceline rate I am happy - if I would have paid the $150/night advertised price for the executive level I would have been disappointed.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDIRTY!\u201d", "Author": "Cyberia0083", "ReviewID": "UR77470316", "Content": "I have to change my room TWICE!

Location is in a business park right off the 401, easy to access and several restaurants and shops nearby.

One major complaint, hallways. From the 2nd to the 7th floor the hallway carpets are disgusting. There are stains everywhere. Ice machines also seem to be a common problem, currently not working from the 4th-6th floors (not sure about 3rd). Every time I walk in the hallway someone shows up with an ice bucket in search of a working machine and I send them up higher. (One little note: 8th and 9th floors which I am assuming are business floors have brand new carpets and ice machines...I find it a little insulting that all floors don't deserve the same.) Finally, the fitness center and pool area are very well done. The pool area has wall murals of palm trees and a brand new rubberized floor to prevent slipping. This was a very nice feature! The pool water was very cold even though it supposed to be heated and the hot tub is drained and not working.

I stayed in room 704 in this hotel for one month until 19 July 2009 together with my wife. The best thing about this hotel is its staff, the people. They are friendly, positive, helpful, smiling and efficient, on all levels from cleaners to the restaurant to the sales management, especially persons belonging to the so-called \"visible minorities\", as Canadian authorities like to define it. The room was large, clean and well presented, with a large double bed, office desk with a good office chair, very-noisy air conditioner, nice and large bathroom. The price was affordable, less than 100 CAD per day for the room (this was a special deal through an organization) incl. free high speed internet, a couple of bottles of fresh water every day and a TV with many Canadian and US channels. Large window opens a wide site of green horizon with often blue sky, so there is plenty of natural light in the room. The hotel has a small but practical swimming pool and a whirlpool (i.e. bubble-bath, spa, US: jacuzzi) which are clean and work well, and towels are provided. The same applies to the gym room. The hotel has a tradition of weekly reception with free food and wine for guests for meeting the management, pleasant and useful. The location of the hotel is probably most favorable for guests visiting the many business corporations in the area and the ACC (Armenian Community Centre). The hotel is located exactly beside the junction of Victoria Park Avenue and the important Highway 401 which connects the east with west of the country. There is practically nothing to do in the local area. The only place to go is the Fairview Shopping Centre at the Don Mills subway station ca. 30 min. walking from the hotel or a 10 min. walking and a 5 min. bus tour (2.5 CAD per person for that tour), which holds good standard with many shops but without a grocery. There is one middle quality grocery called Food Basics ca. 15 min. walking from the hotel, and a Chinese Market ca. 10 min. walking, but I think the latter may be suited for the specially interested, as the smell alone might drive you away if you try to shop the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd daily food and other items there. There are several junk food outlets in the area ca. 10-15 min. walk from the hotel. A TTC bus (the public transport of Toronto) can take you to Toronto Zoo within ca. 30 min. from a bus stop at 10 min. walking distance from the hotel. It is also possible to order a bus tour to Niagara Falls by a direct pick-up and return at the hotel entrance, ask the reception about this. This tour arrangement called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153C U Tours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is great, but the driver is controlling the car only by one hand at high speed as his other hand is holding a microphone for various guiding stories most of the time, beware. To get to downtown one needs to walk ca. 10-15 min., than take a bus, than the subway, than change the subway later at the Sheppard station to Yonge line. The entire trip to downtown takes ca. 45 minutes, incl. the walking from the hotel. It costs 2.5 CAD per person per tour (i.e. one way). Remember to ask the driver of the bus for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transfer ticket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as it is the ticket you have to use later for your continuous journey in the subway as well. Similarly one must take a Transfer Ticket when entering the subway on the way from downtown to the hotel, as one has to use it after exiting the subway for taking bus no. 85, 85A, 85B, 85C, 85D, 24, 24A, 190 or 167 from Don Mills subway station to Victoria Park Avenue, from where one has to walk to the hotel. The bathroom had a leakage somewhere from the system, and the floor was flooded after each shower session. In our experience the worst thing in this hotel is its handling of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign related to the management of their cleaning activities. Everyday a Housekeeping Department representative would call us up with a terribly loud telephone ringing, wake us up, and tell us that she had noticed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign on our door, and that she needs to know if we need a service that day. At first we were shocked and terrified, but took it with comprehension. I spoke with the front desk staff, and they promised me that no one would ever wake us up again if we continue to hang the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign on the outside of our door. The next day the woman called us again. This terror continued every day, and made it impossible for us to sleep in peace even though we were setting out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign. One Saturday they called us at 08:30. One Sunday they knocked the door to ask if we need a service on ca. 10:30 with the sign hanging out. I have spoken with the reception staff about 4 times about this, and every time they apologized and promised to talk the Housekeeping Manager to her senses. Nothing helped. After being terrorized for ca. 10 days I simply disconnected the two telephones in the room. This finally gave us an opportunity to sleep for few days. However, I needed to use the phone, and one day I connected it and forgot to disconnect after using. The next morning we were shocked up again by the Housekeeping who wanted to know why we have set out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign, do we need service or not?! Once again I spoke with the front desk, and again they promised me that we will be left in peace in the future if we hang out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign. The next morning the same nightmare continued. I got enough of this and once again disconnected the two phones in the room and never again used them during our stay. The last day of our stay I connected the phones before checking out, and saw the Message light blinking. I clicked the button and heard that the Housekeeping Manager had left many messages in the mornings asking us if we need service. I think the Housekeeping shall never disturb guests by knocking at the door or by calling them or in any other way, if the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign is set out, and shall clean the room only after the sign is removed by the guest, at least this is my experience from the many European hotels I have used in my life.", "Date": "July 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDirty with bugs\u201d", "Author": "shik92", "ReviewID": "UR34273075", "Content": "First night we spent there, we were bitten by bed bugs.

You could tell the rooms were remodled. Bathrooms a bit small but in good conditon. Even had a scale in the bathroom. King size bed was nice. Sheets seemed clean. Overall the Rooms were very nice.

The pool was on the small side. No towels in the pool area but it was rectified upon mentioning it to front desk staff. Hot tub was nothing special but adequate. One complaint is about the pet policy. I sent an email 2 weeks ahead of time to the email listed on the local hotel website reguarding some more detailed information about pets. I received no response. The hotel website states it accept's pets but failes to give any further information whether there is a charge for pets etc . We brought our small puppy which was less than 5lbs with us on the trip without knowing if it would cost us anything additional. When checking in I inquired about my pet staying and was told it was an extra $30/night . This is riddiculous! I just ended up having the pup stay with family in the area. I think the hotel should updated its website to show rates/charges for pets staying at the hotel and more detailed information reguarding it's pet policy. Hotel is located right beside the 401. So my room # 822 was facing the 401 and was a bit noisy but not bad considering. I still had a good nights sleep. The view was not bad either.

We were looking just for a place to crash after shopping and this hotel was great. The room was very spacious and clean for this type of hotel. I am used to staying a 5-star hotels in downtown Toronto (Sutton Place, King Edward, Westin Harbour, Royal York, etc). While the Radisson is not in the same league, it is better than what I expected and in some aspects were better than the 5-stars. The spaciousness was a plus...room had a king bed, desk and chair, sofa chair and ottoman. Washroom was average size...not huge but big enough to move around without rubbing up on the counter, tub, or toilet. The bed was a Sleep Number bed...where you could adjust each side independently with a remote to control the softness/firmness. Nice touch...I don't think I'd ever buy a bed like that but I've stayed in 5-star hotels where the mattresses were horrible. The Sleep number was reasonably comfortable and a nice surprise (I still prefer our pocket-coil bed at home). Parking was an open lot in front of the hotel. Lots of space. Not covered parking but also no added charge (unlike the downtown 5-stars) for parking. We took the advice of others on this site and requested a room facing the parking lot and not the highway so we never heard any traffic noise. We did not use the restaurant or amenities so we cannot rates those. We had no problems with the front desk staff...check in and out was quick and easy. Overall, an excellent hotel for the money. Great place to stay if you are not looking to spend a lot of time playing in the hotel. Would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cDelightful stay at the Radisson\u201d", "Author": "mangie", "ReviewID": "UR5575397", "Content": "Just returned from a wonderful stay at the Radisson Hotel Toronto East. After spending all day at Canada's Wonderland, we checked in late to the hotel. Check in was fast & the front desk staff was very friendly & helpful. Our room was large & very clean. The king size bed was so comfortable, just what we needed after a long tired day at Wonderland. The bathroom was also very clean, nice toiletries & the shower had good water pressure. The room was so quiet, couldn't hear anything from our 5th floor room, courtyard side. The continental breakfast was a great bonus. Good buffet selection of hot & cold items such as cereal, fruit, muffins, eggs, sausage, home fries, french toast, bacon, pancakes, ham and all the other usual buffet items. Food was quite tasty, no complaints. The free parking at the hotel was also a nice bonus. Only a 10 minute drive downtown, very convenient. The hotel was a great location for us, right between Canada's Wonderland & downtown. The value for your money can't be beat.

I asked him to explain tome why there are ash trays and matches in in the rooms! They tolled me they do not have a crib or refrigerator available for the night but they will have it in the morning, I was there for 6 days and never saw either one. I asked them for another bed because one bed was not enough for my wife and my two children, they brought us a roll-away bed to the room. It was so filthy that we did not use it. Room was so dirty there were chunks of food stuck to the carpet. 2 AM I decided I am here for vacation and will not put up with this. They moved us, actually they just gave us a cart and I moved everything, to a new room. This one was not as filthy as the other one. I stayed at this hotel for 6 days.

If you have business in the west-Scarborough or east-North York areas of Toronto, it's a great choice, particularly if you're approaching Toronto from the east along the 401 (e.g., from Kingston or Ottawa).

The Victoria Park subway station is about 10km south, which is your gateway to all Toronto has to offer. Parking is available at the subway station.
