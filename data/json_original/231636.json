The hotel itself is in a very old building \u2013 we had a good room that needed a little more lights in my opinion, a quiet and efficient elevator and very good firm beds. Bathroom was also to our satisfaction and the staff very efficient. Breakfast good with a lot of choices and the little bar has a very good red wine by the glass. We brought the Michelin guide for restaurants but that was not necessary as there are many good places just around the corner \u2013 a tapas and wine place with very good inexpensive food and wine in the nearby street.

We spent 6 days in the city and even went to the museum area and Park Retiro twice and never used the metro. The hotel itself is located a block off a main drag, so even with this location, it is quietly tucked away on a little square with minimal traffic. There are church bells as others have talked about, it woke me up a few of the nights but did not bother my wife. Having a patio looking over the square and the monastery was well worth this slight inconvenience. Rooms were large and very nice. Staff was very friendly when we talked with them. We spoke very little Spanish and had no problem. We thought they might get tired of us since we kept bringing back bottles of wine to have the bar open but they were very kind and ensured we even had nice clean glasses of wine in our room each night. Other negatives I have read talk about lack of or high expense of breakfast/dinner.

Like a recent reviewer the hotel staff were made aware of this at the time of booking and we requested rooms on the same floor. Upon arrival at the hotel we checked into our room to find the shower door literally leaning against the outer wall and the wardrobe door hanging off it's runners . I brought this immediately to the receptionist staff attention only to be told the hotel was full and they would move us the next day. The absence of surprise at the defects and the lack of any sort of apology was notable. The room itself was clean and a credit to the staff responsible but, having said that,verging on the shabby with very worn carpets. We had to wait until after 2pm the next day to check into a new room and even then,the keys to the new room were tossed to us with no hint of an apology. This is a real pity as a beautiful building in a wonderful location is being allowed to go to seed with clearly a customer service issue with some of the reception staff a real issue. The hotel could be a real gem. This was our fourth visit to Madrid and we do travel extensively. We did enjoy our visit in spite of the shortcomings mentioned.

At the entrance we were greeted and a member of staff took charge of our luggage. The receptionist was pleasant and explained the basics in English as our Spanish is to say the least below requirements. The lobby is narrow, but fit for purpose and opens out into a spacious lounge area which has a multi-panelled clear glass ceiling looking up to a clear glass roof over the lounge, the four walls which face into the area are the rooms away from the streets. There are two lifts, one modern and one which is beautifully restored from an era of elegance long gone. Our room overlooked the Plaza San Martin and we had a lovely view over the opposite roof tops. The rooms are comfortable and the beds whilst giving the appearance of being double are in fact two wide singles pushed together. Excellent nights sleep was had in what we both agreed are one of the most comfortable of hotel beds. The room was of adequate size complete with mini-bar and free room safe along with the usual trimmings. The dining room which is on the ground floor appears to have recently been decorated in what we thought are tasteful elements. Breakfast consists of an extensive buffet array which surely caters for every taste, and there is an option to have additional items cooked upon request. The dining room doubles as the restaurant in the evening and is open until midnight. The menu is of traditional Spanish cuisine and whilst good, we thought a bit over priced. Attractions in the locality, opposite are the museum where there is presently an art collection by the Russian artist Marc Chagall. The Real Palace is within a 15 minute walk, Opera is nearer and en-route to the Royal Palace. The Plaza Sol where most of Madrid seems to congregate on Sunday afternoon is less then 10 min walk. The local transport network is fantastic and we would recommend the purchase of the Tourist Ticket as it is exceptional value for money being available on the Metro and the EMT bus networks. Nearest Metro station is about 400m from the hotel at Callao and if leaving the Metro choose the exit that brings you out onto Plaza Callao and head for Calle San Martin (a pedestrian only street) We will return as Madrid has a lot more to offer than can be catered for in one week.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cLots of value\u201d", "Author": "Sarah W", "ReviewID": "UR124739244", "Content": "Just returned home from a week stay in Spain.

I would agree with most things - we enjoyed our stay, would return there again, and would recommend it to our friends. Staff were exceptional, as was location, and great having free internet in roonm. Also, having El Cortes Ingles Department Store/Supermarket/Travel Agency (they do everything), right nearby was a plus. BUT I would nit-pick about a few things. We stayed on 3 occasions over 2 weeks, and had 3 different rooms. Firstly it was room 504 - we were upgraded to a suite and were over the moon. Couldn't fault anything - except no tea making facilities. We solved this by buying an electric jug at aforementioned store, plus two mugs. We used them extensively on our trip. Next we stayed in room 402. This was a double room and quite good, but we had been spoilt by our suite, so for our final visit we paid for an upgrade. Room 402 and the suite we had had excellent bathrooms. Back again to Room 508, our suite we upgrade to. What a disappointment. It was facing the afternoon sun and was boiling hot even with the air-conditioner. On the outside balcony there was an ashtray full of cigarette butts, and these remained there for 4 days! It didn't seem as big as our previous suite, but the bathroom was just awful. Not even as big as our ordinary room, the toilet and bidet almost touched each other and you couldn't sit on toilet in the normal manner. But worst of all it had an ultra modern shower (no doubt cost a fortune), but we couldn't even get it to work on the simplest setting. Staff, as usual, were most obliging and went out of their way to help us, but even they struggled to get it to work in the simplest way possible. So disappointing our stay in this room.

Close to shopping centre, train, Plaza Mayor, palace, we walked everywhere. Although it is quite a long walk to Retiro Park. When we first arrived our airconditioning did not work, so we reported it to reception. A gentleman came to our room to check we had the settings right, he left and shortly phoned to inform us that the room would be cold in 15 minutes as they had to connect it to something (?). Anyway, we left for the afternoon and returned to a hot room, so they relocated us to another room which was on the top floor and had great views. Just not sure why we weren't moved in the beginning. We didn't have any tour options or sightseeing info provided to us from reception at all. We'd already organised what we wanted to do before our holiday so this didn't bother us. We only received an 'Hola' every morning when we walked past. The free wi-fi is great and connection is good. If you're someone that doesn't like to wear wrinkled clothing, be sure to bring a travel iron as there is not one provided in the room, and it costs 4-14 Euros to iron an article of clothing through the laundry service, depending on what it is. The bed is two singles pushed together, and made up as singles too (each bed has its own sheets). The beds are simply pushed together with a king size coverlet over it. Very comfy though, and so are the pillows we had. Only two english speaking tv channels - BBC and Europe BBC. Cant comment on the restaurant as we didnt eat there. There are literally hundreds of restaurants around, including restaurants in the alley up the side. The first one you come across from the hotel end (Descales - spelling?) - do not eat there. Horrible food, rude service, and 4 Euro for a small basket of bread!! They brought the bill to us, we pulled out the exact amount of money only for the man to say \"tips are not included in this total\" (very odd as everywhere else includes a service charge). So he left it on the table and waited for us to leave a tip. Very bad, and lucky we didn't come across this anywhere else in Madrid otherwise we would've hated our trip. We did a trip out to Avila and Segovia for a day which was nice to get out of the city as there isn't that much to do in Madrid. Next time we visit we'll most likely stay out in the country, out of the city, and visit when it is snowing so we can go skiing on the mountains.

The hotel is situated in the old city, close to restaurants, shops and many popular tourist attractions of the old city. There are a couple of metro stations close by, but once we have got your bearings, Madrid is not that big and walking around is easy; we did not use the metro. To get to the hotel from the airport we chose to take the Metro from the airport to Nuevos Ministerios Metro station, which departs the airport every 5 minutes and costs 2 Euro. To get to the hotel by metro looked a bit difficult (need to change lines once or twice) so we got a taxi from Nuevos Ministerios to the hotel, for under 10 Euros, so all up, the cost was around 14 Euros. The hotel is situated in a charming old building in a quite location, which has been modernised. I believe the building used to house the American Embassy around the early part of the 20th Century. Check in staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was not large but very tastefully furnished and quiet. Our roomed overlooked the interior courtyard. Good bathroom (shower over bath). Mini bar and safe, and the mini bar stock was very reasonably priced compared to most international hotels. As we arrived a little late and decided not to go out and eat, but arranged some tapas through room service, which was excellent and reasonably priced. Breakfast is served in the restaurant on the top floor, with some lovely views over the roof tops of the old city. Our tariff included breakfast, which was a buffet (European style), but you could order hot egg dishes. Try the fried eggs with some of the local ham. They are the best fried eggs I have ever tasted. If breakfast is not included in your room rate, I am told that the breakfast buffet is very expensive. Wi fi internet is available free of charge. Ask at the front desk for a password.

The price quoted for a reservation made the luxurious facade a bit suspicious, could it be too good to be true? It really was. From the attentive and friendly staff, you'd be delighted to stay in a facility that somehow manages to bring together price, service, luxury and location - all in one. It is not only a rarity in Europe but in most major cities in the world. The beds are extremely comfortable and the authentic decor between the classic and the modern go together perfectly. We didn't get a chance to try the restaurant but the menu made it seem up to the standards. There is a very small fitness facility too. Palacio Real and other major attractions as Gran Via are just a few steps away. Local shops, pubs and nightclubs are very close too. Being so close to where the action is in Madrid, the hotel also manages to give you an extremely quiet and peaceful atmosphere. TIP: Don't rush to use the modern elevator and try the old fashioned/authentic manual elevator which is still in service.

It is beautiful with 19th century style, every graceful and elegant. It is next to a royal convent, acrossed the street is Caja Madrid, a culture fundation with exhibition associated with the Thysen Bornemisa Museum. You see people lined up to visit the convent around the corner. But it is very quiet at night. It is walking distance to most of the sites: Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Museo del Prado, Museo Thysen Bornemisa, Parque del Retiro, the Royal Palace. The area has many stores and restaurants. The only place we took the subway to is Reina Sofia, the modern art museum. We took the airport express bus (2 euro per person) to Atocha Renfe (railway station), then took a taxi to the hotel on a Saturday which costed 12 euro. I recommend this way to and from the airport. It is a long long way to go by taxi only and would be very expensive. The hotel has a restaurant and bar, gym too. The best thing offered by the hotel is the map. Please ask for this map at the front desk before you venture out, it will save you from getting lost in the meandering streets and little plazas. I bought a Streetwise map for Madrid before my trip and got another city map from the Tourist Information center, but it is the map I got from the hotel I use everyday. This hotel has free Wi-Fi too, just ask for the code at the front desk. There is a computer near the lobby for guests, but no printer. You need to e-mail your airline boarding pass to the hotel and they will print it for you.

If you want a bunch of redcoats behind the counter go to Butlins. The bedrooms were well equipped with all the usual bits and pieces and two big twin beds pushed together which were very comfortable. After reading another review we requested a room overlooking the square. There was only one left which our friends got and was like a suite, much bigger than ours. The breakfast was first class all the fruit, cereals, hams/meatsand cheeses you could eat and a selection of cooked breakfasts as well.We didn't get a chance to try out the gym so can't comment. The bar is very small and in the foyer and you have to go to the reception to get a member of staff to serve you but this was only a few steps away so no great problem.This is a relatively small hotel in a lovely area of town which is nice and quiet and night with very comfortable rooms. All in all it was exactly the sort of hotel that we like and I would have no problem in reccomending it to anybody. If you go to the Plaza Mayor there is a beautiful old tapas bar adorned with bulls heads and lots of old photos of bullfights and celebrities who have frequnted it in the past. this is a beutiful little bar but be warned.

So close to the bustle, yet set in a beautiful old building in a tranquil square - perfect! Transport: the airport bus costs 2 euros to Cibeles, then go round the corner to the metro, red line, Banco de Espana - 1 euro ticket ('sencillo') for 3 stops to Opera, then it's just a few minutes walk along C/Arenal, 4th on the left! A taxi back to the airport costs about 30 euros. Our room (207) was not the prettiest, but had a modern bathroom with a powerful shower, and being at the end of the corridor, was very quiet and restful. It was cleaned well each day, generally whilst we were having breakfast. There's a lovely little lounge beside the bar, although we preferred to sit under the atrium with a glass of rioja - which was not expensive at all. I can highly recommend taking breakfast in the hotel - it's well worth the few euros when you make the reservation. The choice of cold meats, breads, cheeses, pastries, cereals and fresh fruit was extensive, and a glass of cava with breakfast added to the sense of luxury. Hot food was also available on request. I was a bit disappointed with the coffee... but then had I have asked, they'd probably have brought me something stronger. Staff in the restaurant and on reception were friendly and helpful, being happy to recommend a great flamenco show (Cafe de Chinitas, C/Torija) and make a phone call to reserve our tickets.

It may be worth noting, as others have, that the interior courtyard is covered by a glass roof. During the cool days of February this was no problem for us but it might be less comfortable in the height of summer. The room's heating and aircon system was very efficient, however. The staff were pleasant and courteous. The location of the hotel is excellent - a couple of minutes form metro Callao and within walking distance of all main sights - Palacio Real, Prado, Centro de Arte Reina Sofia - as well as a variety of different neighbourhoods - Chueca, La Latina, Puerta del Sol and Plaza Santa Ana are all within easy reach. Some visitors have mentioned the presence of homeless people near the hotel. We did notice a couple of people in the street just round the corner but never felt uncomfortable walking around the area either during the day or at night.

The bed was comfortable and there was no extra charge for the safe in the room. However we should note a few issues with this hotel. The hotel and the room was very clean however, there was a sewage odor in the bathroom that seemed to come and go. Also having a king size bed in Europe is not the norm. What we had was two twins pushed together but there was no padding in-between and had individual sheets so for a couple it was not convenient but was comfortable for sleeping. The pillows were great. Having an inside room was great for controlling the noise for being in the heart of the city and you had a window that opened up into what seemed to be a sky lit atrium but the atrium had a glass roof which I am sure was helping with the noise but allowed for no fresh air. The Hotel supplies you with everything you could need and if you do need something they will give it to you, including directions to different types of restaurants i.e Indian and Chinese if local cuisine is not your thing. We were on the third floor and breakfast was served each morning on the sixth floor. The hotel only has 1 elevator which could only hold 4 people max so trying to get to breakfast via the elevator could take a while. Once on the sixth floor, when standing, there was a view of the city which was great for determining the weather for the day. The breakfast buffet compared to our stay in Barcelona was outstanding. There were at least 8 different types of fresh fruit each morning along with several types of hams, cheeses, breads, and pastries.

A few steps away from Calle Arenal, Callao metro station, movie theaters, Gran V\u00eda, Puerta del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Corte Ingle, shops, bars, restaurants, etc. FRIENDLY STAFF Front desk personnel are very friendly and responsive both in person and by phone GREAT VALUE Nowadays is a great value, and the breakfast and the internet access are included in the daily rate. GREAT BREAKFAST Great selection and quality. Nice looking restaurant in the top floor overlooking Madrid's rooftops. BEAUTIFUL BUILDING, LOBBY, BAR AREA, STAIRS, HALWAYS This hotel is in a charming Madrid building, built long time ago, and it has certain charm (Old US Embassy). While the front desk is small, and there's only a small office behind it for their personnel and that may give a first time guest a \"not so good\" first impression (as it happened to me), once you go past the front desk, and into the bar area is homey and charming indeed, with friendly staff at the bar. The stairs and the old Madrid elevator are very beautiful, The hallways are nicely decorated, well lit, and quiet, with a nice carpet in very good shape (at least in the second floor, where I just stayed). AVAILABILITY OF QUIET ROOMS (facing internal Courtyard) I stayed in room 206 which faces an internal courtyard, and it was very quiet. Perfect! This is particularly attractive (for me) because this hotel is in a very busy area, and it can be noisy outside due to vehicles, pedestrians, and all the people coming out of bars singing and talking loudly at night, specially on Saturdays. I know so, because I have also stayed for many days in a nice hotel next to this one... The Roomate Laura, which I also recommend, but with the caveat that there are no internal rooms there, and the windows and doors were not soundproofed at the time when I was there (Sep to Dec 2008). See my review of such hotel here in TripAdvisor also. So, I now choose this hotel over the Roomate Laura in good part for such reason. (It's also a better value now. It used to be the opposite in 2008). NICELY DECORATED AND SPACIOUS BATHROOMS WITH GREAT SHOWER Beautiful. Well lit and with plenty of hot water at high pressure, and with shower controls that are easy to figure out and operate. Beats the much pricier Grand Meli\u00e1 Fenix where I also stayed recently which has dark showers with low pressure only, and one of those modern Grohe shower controls which take a while to figure out how to operate. VERY GOOD AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM Adjustable with temperature settings marked on the dial, easy to operate, quiet and effective operation. It also beats the Grand Melia Fenix, which while it's also quiet and effective, it's not easy to operate as it does not have temperature settings marked in its dial, and has a second on/off switch in a different part of the room (next to the bed) which required me to call the Service Desk to know of its existance. INTERNET ACCESS (WI FI) INCLUDED IN THE DAILY RATE This is one of the issues that I am sensitive about, even when I normally travel for business and the company pays for all my expenses. They way I look at it, nowadays hotels should offer the internet access at no extra charge, just like the water coming out of the pipes, and the lights, and the A/C in the room. IMO, if they charge for it, the daily fee should be reasonable. Let's say that I pay USD 50.00 per month at home (in Miami, Florida, USA) for a DSL line (6 MB download / 512 kB upload speed). A hotel that charged USD 5.00 per day, would not make me blink, but often enough those hotels that charge for it, have exhorbitant fees USD 15, or 20, 25, 27, 30 per day. Well, when I stayed in this hotel the first time in 2008, they used to charge 17 EUROS per day for the internet access. Now they offer it at No Extra Charge... Congratulations and THANKS for such decision. On the not-so-good side, at the present time it is only available via WiFi in the lobby area, but according to the front desk staff, they are in the process of installing the equipment that would make it available in the rooms sometime in the fall of 2009. BRAND NEW FLAT PANEL TV (room 206) There was a brand new SONY BRAVIA flat pannel TV, possibly 27 inches or so on top of the desk. Some travelers might appreciate this. For me, that is not a factor because I normally do not watch TV in the hotels, and much less if I am staying in Madrid's downtown. I'd rather be outside enjoying what this city has to offer. Of course, it's a \"nice to have\" feature for a \"rainy day\". NOT PLUSES (BUT NOT NECESSARILY MINUSES) ROOM SIZE (206) This room is relatively small, and the desk, and chair are too close to the bed. I have seen other rooms of the same category and price, and they have different sizes and/or configurations, so it's a matter of either being lucky or asking the front desk for another room if the one assigned to you initially is not to your liking (depending on availability of course). On the plus side, since this room is in the second floor, and faces the courtyard on top of the lobby/bar, it is possible to catch the WiFi signal from the lobby. The signal strength was not high and sometimes it faded away and I got disconnected, but it worked most of the time. This should not be an issue in the future once they install the WiFi equipment in each of the floors. ROOM DECORATION (206) SO-SO There is a contrast between the nice look of the hallways which are also very well lit, and the not-so-nice look of the rooms, which are not-so-well lit either. The desk, night stands, and the bed look like they have been there for decades. However, considering how good value this hotel is, I am just mentioning this here as a potential improvement, and not as a complaint or criticism. However, if the hotel management decides to renovate the rooms eventually and make them look and feel consistently with the nice hallways, that would be VERY welcome.

I travel extensively to many countries in Europe, Middle East and Africa for business, and I have found real gems thanks to the input of other travelers, so it feels good to be able to return the favor and contribute here. I have found that in general, while the priciest hotels (5 stars and top 4 stars) are a safe bet, in some cases, they have their shortmings (from minor to major) and that often enough there are better options and better values \"next door\" and thanks to TripAdvisor's travelers input, it's easy to make an informed decision and have a better travel experience. :-)", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "oregon64", "ReviewID": "UR38703073", "Content": "The Palacio San Martin was just special. It is located within easy walking distance to Plaza Mayor, shopping, numerous tapa bars, historical sites and the major art museums including the Thysson, Prado and the Reina Sophia. The hotel is elegant and the staff helpful, welcoming and warm. It has free internet and WifFi access. We had brought along a new I-Touch but couldn't get it to link to the Wifi. The staff worked with us for at least 30 to 45 minutes attempting to make the link. Although we weren't able to make it work, we really appreciated the staff's diligence in trying. The breakfast at the hotel was great. It's on the top floor overlooking the city. I have to say that I'd like to know what brand of coffee they used. It had to be one of the finest in the city. We were able to find nearby bookstores. The staff helped arrange an excursion tour to the Excorial and the Valley of the Fallen that began within easy walking distance of the hotel. They recommended several nearby restaurants for menu de dia. The rooms are well kept and I would love to come back to the Intur some day.

The only computer wireless available is in the pretty, comfortable lobby with a small bar. Sometimes we had to wait our turn at the computer--they should really get more than one. Hotel was quiet, desk staff were kind and helpful and spoke enough English to communicate our needs. Our daughter joined us for two nights and they moved a cot into our room at no extra charge for her. They quickly arranged taxi service when we needed it but could not tell us where to find a laundrymat. (Hotel laundry was excessively expensive). The square in front of the hotel was in need of cleaning and attention despite the prescence of a summer cafe. Homeless people slept on the grates every night and were always present in the morning and urinated openly in the grassy areas in clear view of the cafe and hotel. This did not particularly bother us since they did not approach us and there are homeless everywhere in Madrid and Europe especially in the hot summer. We loved the location of the hotel--we walked everwhere in Madrid and took the metro from Sol or Grand Via if we had to without problem. The cafes around the corner and down the back from the hotel are more \"authentic\", generous and cheaper--alwasy offering tapa and large drinks. Stay away from the food establishments in and around Plaza Mayor--they are touristy, expensive and unsanitary--had terrible paella there. Go further afield and have a better experience. Also, the Madrid bus tour is very good for orienting you to the city before starting out on foot. The tours run by the Julia Company in Plaza Espagna are very good as well, comfortable and clean with both English and Spanish speaking guides. Cafe con leche,queso bocadillas, and tortilla espangnola fabulous everywhere. Don't miss the camp de mayo overlook and cafe for a view of the Almudena catherdral and wonderful food. Would we stay here again--absolutely!!!", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, England", "Title": "\u201cFresh air and daylight would have been nice\u201d", "Author": "Briercliffe", "ReviewID": "UR29311585", "Content": "We stayed at the Intur Palacio San Martin last weekend, for four nights with two friends. Our stay didn't start off too well.... Any form of greeting on arrival at the hotel was non existent, in fact the receptionist, who was on the phone when we walked in, didn't even acknowledge us or even look at us while we waited to be checked in. Nor did he apologise, welcome us or make any friendly conversation. Then came the rooms we were allocated (how I wished I'd insisted on changing room before I unpacked - although it was 9pm and we were starving and quite tired I suppose). We were given rooms 316 and 317 which overlook that dreaded lightwell. Whoever designed the refurbishment of the hotel and covered over the lightwell should be shot! On opening our french doors we were hit with warm stagnant air, so we ended up keeping them permanently closed and using the AC (which just dries out your eyes and mouth!). Plus, the room was very dark and we had to permanently have the lights on, which weren't that bright either. I like fresh air and to be able to see daylight, and what the weather's doing. I could only do that when in the breakfast room each morning. The main atrium lounge area isn't much better: brighter but still a bit stagnant. The main hotel toilets have no venitlation either, and are damp - nice! After spending four days feeling 'couped up' I really wished I'd swapped on arrival. This problem annoyed me more and more as time went on. The room: apart from being dark and badly ventilated, was fairly spacious and well appointed. Comfortable bed and good shower. We nearly gagged one evening on returning to our room after the maid had used the most foul smelling bleach I've ever known - it took hours for the smell to go! My first shower, on the Thursday night, saw me unravelling a bath towel that had a stain on it that looked like old blood! The towel was promptly changed but I did check each clean towel after that. The breakfast: great selection of tasty food and drinks on offer, awful service particularly on the saturday and sunday mornings (one good waitress and a gormless boy waiter - we cleared and laid our own table on the Saturday after waiting for so long!) and only one tea/coffee station; a Nespresso machine. It became funny after a while, watching the queue of half asleep guests trying to fathom out how it worked, then realising that it had run out of water/had a fault/was full of waste pods!!! The coffee it produced was nice, but for heavens sake BUY A SECOND ONE.... they can't be that expensive!!! Oh, by the way, the hotel has a small gym and a sauna (we weren't aware). Both work and are useful for a quick workout. The gym has 5 pieces of equipment and is well maintained. It also has a fridge stocked full of complimentary bottled water - tip! The location was absolutely brilliant, and we didn't spot one homeless person or drunk in the four days we were there. The square isn't as ugly as suggested in previous reviews and its really well located for pretty much everywhere: 10/15 minutes easy stroll to the palace, cathedral, Plaza Major and Prado. Shopping district on your doorstep, masses of bars and restaurants within 5-10 minutes, it couldn't have been better. Thinking back, we did sleep soundly every night! The quiet lightwell did have its benefits I suppose!", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cHistoric hotel in a good location-but the bells:(\u201d", "Author": "garfield2009", "ReviewID": "UR28984770", "Content": "My husband and I were in Madrid for a combination pleasure/business trip. the room was fine (except for the church bells that chime at 6:30 AM each day).

If you want a trendy or just typically American hotel with lots of extras, look elsewhere.

The rooms are large (by European standards) with high ceilings, modern bathrooms, comfortable beds. Some of the rooms do face the interior court so, if you're like me and prefer fresh air and sunlight in the morning, ask for a room on a higher floor facing the plaza. The plaza may not be the prettiest, but I'm a solo female traveler and have never had any problem there. In fact, the only problem I've ever had with the plaza is directing taxi drivers there, no one seems to know it by the name of Plaza San Martin. Tell your driver to go to Plaza de las Descalzas, same place, more familiar location. The hotel's in close proximity to Puerta del Sol, the Callao metro station is up the block, shopping and restaurants are all around, and you can easily get from here to any site you'd want to visit.

Thanks to all the other reviews, we have choosen this hotel mainly for being located at a quiet square in the heart of Madrid. And it turned out to be true. We had room No. 409, the best room in the hotel, like they say. Its a corner room on top of the buliding with two small balconies and good views onto the plaza, the convent and beyond. The room was very nice with a very big bed (its actually two single beds being put together), nice classic decoration, minibar, tv, aircondition but no coffee making facilities. Big bathromm with a very good and strong shower and pidet, if needed. As the plaza is quiet we strongly recommend to take a room facing the plaza. Moreover the balcony doors are doubled up and if closed you dont hear anything.

There is some type of venting system that is in the middle of the square in front of the hotel which the homeless people use to sleep on top of.

We started with a room overlooking an airshaft, which was quite dark, so moved to a room overlooking the side street above a sidewalk cafe and a group of 5 to 15 homeless guys mostly in their 20s acting like jerks with their radios, flutes, dogs and drunken banter. This group lived (and I assume lives still) in the area between the hotel's front door and this side street, aka under our window. This was mostly a problem at night, but the double paned windows completely shut out the noise. The problem was that the air conditioner wasn't up to keeping the sealed room at a comfortable temperature. Both of us would awake during the night to a hot and airless room. My recommendation is to ask for a room on the plaza, at the front of the hotel (but not on the end with the homeless). The room itself was above average size for a 3 star European hotel, with a large bathtub/shower in a well appointed bathroom. The room had comfortable chairs and decent reading lights. There are only 2 elevators, and thus the wait can be excessive during busy times, but most of the time it wasn't an issue. There is a very nice sitting area on the ground floor where drinks are served, and daily newspapers are available in several languages. This area is light and airy, and was the only public area that we ever used in our recent stay at 6 hotels in Spain. There is overpriced internet access from one computer in the common area. The hotel staff, from front desk to bar attendant to cleaning crew was consistently professional, helpful and pleasant. Probably most tourists stay in the area around the Prado. This hotel is not in that area, though the Prado is reached with a pleasant 20-25 minute walk. This hotel is in the area near the Grand Via and near the palace.

As commented by the previous reviewers, there were some vagrants located outside the hotel. However, they were situated on the corner of the hotel, not directly outside the front door as previously advised. Walking past any homeless people (including these) is not a pleasant experience but you have to accept that there are homeless people in cities throughout the world. If it bothers you that much, you could generally avoid them by walking around them, rather than straight past. I did not feel threatened at any time. Now back to the hotel, the reception and the lounge is quite small but very pleasant. We were allocated a room on the 2nd floor which was quite large with a view of the Plaza. The bathroom was a bit small but more than adequate. The cleanliness of the hotel throughout was excellent. The staff were generally friendly and helpful but some only had a very basic knowledge of the English language. One receptionist totally mis-understood a simple request due to the language barrier. As commented previously, breakfast at the hotel is expensive. However, if this is not an issue the quality of the food and general atmosphere is very good. Breakfast is served on the top floor with panoramic views of the City. Also tried the evening meal at the hotel, once again a bit pricey but it you want something special it is definitely worthwhile. The hotel has recently introduced a three course set menu with a choice of courses for 25 euros per person, including wine and coffee. Recommend visiting the main attractions including the Royal Palace, Playa Mayor, Retro Park and the museums. There is also a temporary exhibition (until 20/05/07) \u201cThe Mirror & The Mask in the age of Picasso\u201d directly opposite the hotel.

Entry to the \u201cMonasterio de las Descalzas Reales\u201d situated next door to the hotel is also free on Wednesday\u2019s for EU citizens. A word of warning though, it is not possible to walk around the convent at your own pace, have to go on a tour. All of the tours are in Spanish and last approximately fifty minutes. Travelled by taxi from the airport to the hotel, approximately 30 euros during rush hour traffic. For the return journey, I recommend the mini bus transfer with aero city for 20 euros for two people.

Being next to the Convent of the Royal Descalceds was a definite advantage, as every taxi driver can identify it as a landmark. For tourists, there are three stops for the hop-on, hop-off bus within a block or two of the hotel. I will stay at this hotel again if I have the opportunity. This hotel compares very favorably to another 4 Star Madrid hotel my parent and I stayed at two years ago. The location is unbeatable.", "Date": "June 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cork", "Title": "\u201cSuperb value for money and great location\u201d", "Author": "spookie", "ReviewID": "UR3505797", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and were very impressed. Having read the previous reviews I thought it worth my while to ring ahead and ask for an outside-facing room so that the windows would open. The staff, in this as in everything else, were very helpful and accommodating. Our room on the fourth floor was lovely - nice size, well decorated and beautifully clean. We left the balcony doors open at night and it was fairly peaceful - except for the bells in the morning. Loud though they were they added to the charm. The location was perfect, we walked everywhere - to the shops, the main squares etc and the museum district was a pleasant 20-30 minute stroll away. There were fabulous Turkish baths about 10 minutes from the hotel - on the other side of the Plaza del Sol (----), well worth a visit. There were plenty people around the Plaza St Martin at all times and we didn't see anything to concern us so I was happy even when returning to the hotel on my own. The large dept store el corte ingles is 2 minutes away and open til 10pm (I think) so a few times I headed over on my own to do a bit of shopping without having any particular safety worries, in fact the atmosphere in the square was very nice and lively and there were always lots of people walking through. We paid \u20ac103 plus I think \u20ac7 tax per night for the room with hotels.com.

The hotel is stylish, very clean, well decorated and very interesting. All staff were very helpful, friendly and accomodating. Recommendations, reservations and suggestions were well made. The room was a good size for a European hotel with many amenities, especially for one in this price range. The location is excellent, in the overlapping area of Old Madrid and Downtown Madrid. We walked almost everywhere, with an occasional metro ride (one block away). The hotel is footsteps from the major department store, El Cortes Ingles. Scores of stores surround it, running parallel to the hotel. Small cafes, tapas bars, great discos, restaurants are within a few blocks. The hotel was very quiet, as there were no late bars in the immediate area. Our room faced the inside enclosed atrium courtyard which was fine by us. Some opinions here have referenced vagabonds in the area. We saw a few, they were all throughout Madrid as in most major cities. There were a few who did like to hang out near the hotel, but they were unobtrusive, polite and never threatening. The hotel is next to a church and art museum, facing a plaza and is not secluded. We were late partyers, walking around the area at 2 a.m., without concern. I am a frequent traveler to 4 and 5 star hotels in the US and Europe.
