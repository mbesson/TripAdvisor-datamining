{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I wouldn't stay here again We stayed here on a Top Deck tour. The hotel was very run down and despite us asking for a non smoking room we were very bluntly told by the front desk that all rooms in all hotels in Italy are smoking and that we would have to deal with it. We persisted and got moved toanother room which was still smokey was not as bad as the one we first had. The room was a good size and clean but we had pillowcases for towels in the bathroom and the TV did not receive all of the channels it said it could. When we complained we were told its a 2 star hotel so deal with it. The hotel is a half an hour walk from town and does not have any facilities near by. I would give it a miss", "Date": "Jul 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR226517527", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "T-A-UK"}, {"Content": "Arno Bellariva: una pessima esperienza!!!   showReview(19257203, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR683383274", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "ithilien"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d667783-r8256676-Hotel_Arno_Bellariva-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "667783", "Price": "$144"}}
