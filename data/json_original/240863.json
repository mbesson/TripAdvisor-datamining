It was clean, the toilet occasionally had weird smell but it wasn't much of an issue. Loved the bed, never wanted to get up!!! Breakfast was a good selection. Not much to choose from but really good. The first day they had a nespresso machine which disappeared on the next day. They offered american breakfast as per request on the first day too. Scrambled eggs and bacon were lovely. The next days, they kinda replaced it with cook scrambled eggs for you to scoop up at the buffet line which looked + tasted horrible. But I didn't mind since the selection of cold cuts, bread, juice, fruits, cereal were enough to keep me happy. Staff are helpful. Had a really nice stay. Cons are, it's not in the centre of everything but the metro is one minute away and Madrid has one of the best public transports. For those who want to go to Santiago Bernabeu, there's a direct bus a block away.

I held this impression when I saw the triple room I'd be sharing with two friends and i was pleasantly suprised to see that we had three single beds as opposed to one double and one single. The shower room/ bathroom was also very clean, although there was no lock on the two way door and no actual door for the shower, so the floor outside of the shower was wet quite often. I wasn't too keen on the smoke screen window for the bathroom as your silhouette was visible from the outside. Even worst, was the fact that the actual shower was seperated from the bedroom by a smoke screen window which showed a clear silhouette of the person showering from the bedroom. We found this funny but it could be a problem depending on who you're sharing a room with. Another downside was that the shower lever had been loosened and fell off whilst I was showering, had it hit my foot, it would have broken a few bones. I fixed this myself, and in the hotels defense, they can't check every shower lever in the hotel. The matresses were hard and the pillows were thin and uncomfortable to sleep on. However the room was cleaned every day, the bath gel, shampoo and soap was replenished and new towels given. The hotel also provides free wifi and free water in each room. They have computers and internet in the lobby although the connection is unbelievably slow and you're better off using your own phone or laptop with the wifi. The hotel is located in a great place. It's 15 minutes from the airport and 15 minutes from the city centre using the metro.

The rooms were cleaned every day, the staff were helpful and the location is ideal for those who are looking to go out and see Madrid. To be honest we didn't use any of the hotels facilities other than the free mini bar which was stocked with water. The rooms have free wi fi for anybody who wants to take their laptop with them and there are also two computers in the lobby that have internet access should you wish to use them. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as often we would just get it on the go. The only thing that was a bit of a let down was that there was no iron in the room and you had to pay for their ironing service. When we asked about it we were told that on Saturdays and Sundays you have to pay more for it which was a bit confusing so we just left it! Apart from that the hotel is PERFECT for the busy madrid tourist!", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "auckland", "Title": "\u201cCould of been longer\u201d", "Author": "pjcat", "ReviewID": "UR27336944", "Content": "We had two nights in this hotel and enjoyed our stay.

I used Google street view to see how to walk from the train station to the hotel. We arrived at midnight, took the train, and very easily found the hotel at night. The staff is very courteous and attentive, although with very limited English. We did not eat at hotel but it does have very nice bar. At the time of our stay hotel offered FREE wireless internet. I don't know if they will maintain this policy. One item we did not like - our room was right next to the elevator so it can get noisy.

The Location was right beside the Metro station and 15 mins away from the centre Sol (which was a change of line) or just about 5 mins to Goa (the main shopping area) which was grand if you didn't mind having to get it. whch we didnt the Metro is brilliant and brings you every where around the city with no real wait. The one thing to note is that if you are going out after 1.30am the metro stops then you willhave to get a taxi home, which is only about 8-10 euro from SOL so not that much. The hotel Staff were lovely. The hotel was clean and had a kind of stylish edge to it rather then comfy . If you prefare to walk outside the door of you hotel and have everything close to you well this may not suit you, but as i said the metro is right beside it.

Firstly the hotel is positoned very near to the Metro so there is no need to get a taxi to reach it, and it is also relatively near to both Madrid City Centre and the Airport. When I first booked it I was quite concerned that the hotel's distance of 10 Metro stops [or so] from the Aiprort would prove to be time consuming but the Metro Travel time was about 20-25 minutes if that. The hotel itself is both modern and stylish. The reception and downstairs lobby has an almost Japense/Oriental feel to it and the reception area furnishing are reminiscent of Asian culture. The pleasant surprise was that this hotel is actually a 4 star hotel and not a 3 star masquerading as a 4 star which was what I found to be the case in another hotel in which I stayed last night! The bedrooms are spacious, stylish and clean with all the facilites you could need. What I espcially liked was the separate sitting room area which had a sofa, desk, chair, separate TV [with decent channels!], wi fi internate connection and the requisite mini bar, etc. The bedroom area was also very spacious and the bed itself huge. There was also a spearate tv ion this room. All in all I would really recommend this hotel for either the discerning businessman, families as well as solo travellers like myself. There is a restaurant and bar area [although the meals do seem to be a bit pricey although I cold be wrong as I never actually ate there.
