Very well-kept furniture and a large bathroom, and as is typical in Spain with a separate toilet and bidet. A small nespresso is provided. However, the required capsules are not freely available. So bring along! Slippers and dressing gown to emphasize the four star standard. Anyone who wants can also iron, an iron is integrated in the room.( we did not) The rooms are medium-sized, but it can certainly stand there for a few days. A lounge access with breakfast (sufficient selection of hot and cold dishes, including access to the breakfast and tea time as well as an appetizer) were included. Also there was a smoking lounge available. And was located on the 7th floor. the tapas bar, connectedt to the hotel, was represented with a large assortment.

Some evenings, the snacks are better than others, but the water, coffees, mixed drinks, and fruits were wonderful. Our room had a heated bathroom floor, slippers and robes, a very comfortable bed, and lots of closet space. Noise was not a problem. We did have a problem with the a/c and heating system; our room was very warm all four nights. We complained to the front desk several times, and their engineer finally came up and said we had a problem. At the end, they gave us a fair discount on our bill for our discomfort. We did not have to get a transportation pass because we could walk to all the major museums and attractions, such as museum island, Brandenburg Gate, the Bundestag, the German History Museum, the DDR Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, and boatrides. The Hauptbanhof is only a 5-minute taxi ride away, and there is a metro station one block away. We could see the Rive Spree from our room. Berlin businesses close down on Sundays, except for museums.

Nice size, windows open all the way to let fresh air in. Bed was pretty comfortable. Feather pillows and down comforters. Breakfast is very good, lots of choices. What I did not like that bed was 2 smaller beds put together and we had 2 super small comforters. I would have preferred 1 large one. We had 1 bathrobe for 2 people, which I thought was strange since we booked room for 2. Room had really funky smell, in fact not only the room, the same smell was in the restaurant as well. We were not able to air it out completely, but open windows helped allot. There were no bath tub, but the shower was large enough for 10 people, we realized that our room was designed for handicapped. Bedding was super clean and crisp, but strongly smelled of chlorine. One last thing, even though there is smoking indoors anywhere in Germany, Melia still has smoking rooms mixed with nonsmoking on the same floors. From time to time somebody would smoke on our floor or in the next room and I would smell the smoke quite often. When I brought it up at the reception I was told that people smoke in all the rooms and there is nothing they can do about it, not like they can check every single room in the hotel.

Being located on Friedrichstrasse meant that you were only about 10-15mins walk away from the designer shops on Friedrichstrasse including Quartier 206 and Galeries Lafayette. Museum island was a 10 min walk away and we actually walked all the way to Alexanderplatz from Museum island thereafter. We had a room overlooking the Spree. The room was well furbished and we liked it very much. It was most amazing to be able to open the balcony room doors at night to check out the night scenery and also, just before we checked out of the hotel, it started snowing in Berlin, so it was like having front row seats to the surrounding area turning white with snow within a matter of minutes. The only minor blemish in the stay was when we requested for a taxi at point of check out. The porter had gone off with some luggages for other guests so we checked at the front desk. The front desk pointed us to the taxi which was sitting out in the cold but when we got out there, there was no taxi driver. I went back in to check with the front desk again for a taxi, but the lady told me to go out there and just wait. We waited for 5-10 mins to no avail (driver was nowhere to be found) and we ended up running onto the main road to hail our own taxi. We are not prima donnas and are perfectly capable of getting our own taxis - but just that, at that point it felt as no one from the hotel / front desk could be bothered with us the moment we stepped out of the hotel.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay\u201d", "Author": "AS1986 Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR125138436", "Content": "Good stay in the Melia.

We were very pleased with our choice. The hotel is well located in \"The Mitte\", 5 minutes walk from Museum Island, The Reichstag and the Brandemburg Gate. The hotel can be reached fairly easily from the airport by the express train (25-40 mins depending on whether the train is direct) - that said, I researched the times and numbers of the trains before we left the UK, and I am pleased I did as it was not that obvious at the airport which train to get. Our room was very clean and pleasantly furnished with a lovely bathroom. The beds were a little soft for our liking, but the linen was very clean and good quality, with a variety of different pillow types. Our room cost an average of \u00a370 per night (we were there 3 nights over half term) excluding breakfast, which I thought was very reasonable given the standard of the hotel. Breakfast was initially priced at 22 euros per person per day, which we declined, as this is well above what I am prepared to pay. However, after discussion with the staff on reception, we found that if we applied for a \"Mas\" card (the hotel chain reward scheme - free to join), breakfast was discounted to 11 euros. We thought this a pretty good deal, and I have to say the breakfast was of a very high standard. I could have scoffed the whole fresh bread table! As we booked the room direct through the hotel website, we also benefitted from a special offer of 15 euros per person per day to spend in the hotel (excluding breakfast). We ate in the tapas bar one night, and spent the rest on drinks in the bar, both of which were very nice. There was even a pianist playing one night which I love. Unfortunately, the following night they screened the football in the bar instead, but this did at least please my husband!

First, the hotel is located where the Friedrichstrasse crosses the Spree River, so there are lovely views of boats and small barges moving up and down the river. It is almost across the street from the Museum Island where many of Berlin's most famous museums and the Dom cathedral are located. It is within walking distance of Unter den Linden street with shopping and Humboldt University nearby, and if you are energetic, you can walk to the Brandenburg Gate and back again. The staff was exceptional, multi-lingual and service oriented. On arrival, we received complimentary bottles of mineral water and cookies from the kitchen. Whenever a small glitch happened (arriving too early for check-in, a broken plumbing fixture, recovering a lost cane), the staff was there immediately to assist and professional. We stayed on \"the Level\" (room 749) with its concierge floor and private breakfast room. It was well worth the extra money spent. The view out over the Spree river with sunsets over the city was great. Breakfasts were well appointed and the quality and service were very good. We were able to use the computers to check on our email, and at 6:00 there were appetizers and an open bar. Every morning an international newspaper (written in your native language) appeared on your door handle. The quality of the fixtures and furnishings in the rooms was top. The beds were turned down every night and the linens were SO comfortable. Everything was very clean and well maintained. After our visit I filled in the hotel's on-line review and received a very timely and personal response from a hotel employee commenting on my remarks (This is something no other hotel has done that I can remember).

First, it is on Friedrichstrasse, right in the centre of Berlin Mitte, and about 300 yards from a subway entrance. It is situated on the bank of the river Spree, and you can walk to the Reichstag from it - a leisurely walk along the river, about 20 mins. Taking the subway is the easiest way to get around, and from this location everything is in easy distance. The hotel itself is well maintained and the staff were extremely helpful. We started off with a regular room as a bed and breakfast, but, about 3 weeks before we left Canada, I went to the web site and found they had a sale on. We were able to get the special executive floor called The Level for less than the regular room, so we changed our booking. This was the best thing we did. The Level is on the 7th floor, and has a private breakfast room, with an extensive buffet, and made to order egg dishes. During the afternoon, it is a lovely quiet lounge where you can have a drink (included) and then at 6pm they have Tapas (it is a Spanish chain) which were excellent, and made it unnecessary for us to go out to find a restaurant that first night. They were plentiful and tasty. In the room the furnishings were smart and comfortable (my husband wanted me to buy a duvet just like the ones we had at Melia!) and there were tea and coffee making supplies. All in all this is a lovely, well situated, well run, comfortable hotel, which is even greater when they give a special on The Level.

The hotel location is excellent right beside the Friedrichstrasse U Bahn and S Bahn systems and with both buses and trams outside the hotel door. There are easier transport systems in Europe to figure out and it does pay off to plan your journey well in advance to see which transport option suits your needs best. I used a 48 hour Berlin Welcome Card Berlin costing 16.50 Euros which made travel very easy even though most of the historic sites are in easy walking distance. Berlin is a big tourist destination and all the major sites were very crowded, especially after 11am, if you hit these before that time you will have easier access and little or no queues. The river cruises are very good value and I followed a previous TripAdvisor tip and took the 1 hour cruise which covers the major riverside sights adequately. With such a wealth of history Berlin is a great city to visit but it lacks the charm of Vienna or Paris, not helped by a surly native population whose manner borders on rudeness and could never be described as friendly.

On arrival we received a nice welcome by the staff. I had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival requesting a river view and informing them the trip was for our wedding anniversary but had not had a reply. I should not have doubted the professionalism of the Melia as we were allocated room 650 on the 6th floor. The view of the river and city was great. The rooms are very modern and finished to a very high standard. Nice comfy beds and pillows which is always high on my wifes agenda! The hotel is in an excellent location and walking distance to alot of the main sights. If your legs let you down then the transport network is cheap and first class. We wandered down to Oranienburger strasse, where we found a good choice of bars and places to eat. We had dinner at oranium which had a good choice of local and international foods and was a very reasonable price. We had room only at the hotel which allowed us to have brekkie at a different place everyday ( 22 euros pp if you want). Although on 2 days we simpley got a starbucks coffee and cake and sat out in the nice weather. We did the usual open top bus trips, lots of companies can be found on unter den linden and we paid 20euros pp for a day hop on/off ticket and they go to all the major sights. Nice touch by the hotel with a nice bottle of champagne for our wedding anniversary. We picked Boccas di Bacco for our anniversary meal.

No kettle in the room and room service is expensive but just go down and get tea and coffee from the bar and take it to your room. There are loads of places to eat and drink, Que Pasa is a mexican restaurant, we went there for magaritas and nachos but the food coming out of the kitchen looked amazing, we ate traditional german food at a restaurant called 1840, lunch at a place called Oranium, all the places we ate at were lovely, cocktails were cheapest in Que Pasa. Restaurant to AVOID is called Buddah (indian restaurant) in a little side street. across the road from the hotel down by the side of the river there is a litle piano bar called van gough, good atmosphere. Getting to the Melia couldn't be easier, come out of Schoenfeld airport, straight in front of you is the train station, you have to buy a ticket from the machine that covers areas ABC, you have to validate your ticket on the platform, you do this by going to one of the red boxes on the platform and putting your ticket in it will stamp the date on the ticket, it is really important to validate the ticket otherwise it's 60 euro fine when you get to your destination, the ticket costs 3 euros each, you can buy what they call a welcome card but to be honest the hotel is so close to all the sights it may not be worth it as everything is within 20 minutes walking distance, anyway, once you get to the train station and you've got your ticket go to platform 4 and catch the the RB14 express train it goes right into the city centre every half hour and takes about half hour to get to friedrichstasse, come out of Friedrichstasse turn left and the Melia hotel is on the right overlooking the river.

Then Melia franchise is not for you. We have just completed a 5 day stay at the Melia. You know that strange feeling you get when you feel disconnected to a place. (The hotel that is). It was if we rented a chunk of real esate from the hotel without any personal connection. There is plenty of take and precious little give. I'll tell you why. For starters The reception staff as you walk in try not to make eye contact with you in case you might ask for something. And if you do ask them for something they know ( and you find out ) you are going to be charged or should I say overcharged for most things that you ask for. There is no free internet but the daily charge if you need it is at least 17 Euro (for a measily 500MB unlikely to cope with the most basic requirements ) and daily 22 Euro for unlimited access. ( a service that is provided free at other hotels or charged at a reasonable rate). Further the staff agree that the price for this access was exorbitant and suggested I warn people on Trip Advisor. Also ask for tea/coffee facilities to have a cup on the occassions that you don't feel like going out. It will cost you another daily 8 Euro. If you want a chill out and watch a little TV in your when recovering from the amazing things Berlin has to offer if you speak English, bad luck. There only two English channels BBC News and CNN which although can be great to watch do understandably need to repeat news items. If you would like any more channels watch a movie add another 20 Euros per day for pay TV. If you speak German you can get about 12 to 15 free channels including movies channels. The token hotel type Gym is free but unfortunately the Gym machine is broken there is hardly any free weights but the treadmill does work at the moment. So you get the idea no help plenty of charges. The room is standard and might make the 4 stars they claim. The breakfast and the breakfast staff are very good however. The location is fine but in Berlin it is so well serviced by the metro that that is not critical. Irrespective please try the Metro early in your stay it is fantastic it will also give you a sense of freedom, easy to use and will open up Berlin in so many ways. (Look on wikipedia for Berlin Metro to get a handle on it.)

This was a great decision and worth the extra expense. We arrived before 10 am but were in our room in less than 15 minutes. The room was great except that there was no electrical outlet near the head of the bed so I had to run a cord across the room at night. Everything was clean and the turndown service was fantastic. We had a corner room so we could see north on Freidrichstrasse plus a great view of the bridge and the River Spree. The weather was great so we could look out the window and enjoy the festive atmosphere of the river, the World Cup watchers at riverfront cafes, and the party boats. The Level lounge provided us with two computer terminals (one of my complaints from my prior review and still one if not staying on the Level), unlimited beer, wine, and snacks throughout the day (had to be consumed in lounge area), concierge service from the nicest, most helpful staff, and a great, freshly prepared breakfast. I thought the breakfast I had downstairs in 2008 was more extensive, but the Level breakfast is fresher, less crowded, and offers such personal service. I think I saw one of the guys the next stay at the parade but not sure since he wasn't wearing his work outfit-just what was underneath it! For my birthday, we arrived at opening time, 7 am, and stayed three hours. I had a bountiful breakfast and at least 2 bottles of champagne-how often do you turn 50?! Breakfast the last two morning was great also but only about 30 minutes and just a few glasses of the bubbly! We bought one of the Berlin bears in the Level lounge as a souvenir. I can't wait to return to Berlin in 2011 and will either stay here or the new Tryp Berlin! We bought at 72 transportation card at the airport which also included entrance to the museums on Museum Island and got our money's worth. We rode the TXL bus to and from the airport (get off at Unter dem Linden and Friedrichstrasse and walk 200 m north or connect at the Hautbahnhof but you end doing as much walking plus there are stairs and train waiting times). We also rode the trams, the U-bahn, the S-bahn, and more busses. All trams and trains were on honor system! Efficient, quick, safe, and clean. No worries about getting around Berlin! We were lucky that the weather was great, we had some good meals, and were able to join in the 2010 CSD celebration. We stumbled on to party at the Galleries Lafayette on my birthday evening and had a great afternoon at the parade in former West Berlin in the Tiergarten area. We are leaving in 2 weeks for Munich and will stay at the Tryp Muenchen and stay on their top floor. I hope the Melia Berlin Level didn't spoil me too much! I got so excited about Germany when in Berlin that I ordered the German Rosetta language course in July and am now on Level 4 out of 5 in just over 3 months. Next time, I will be able to enjoy Berlin much more in the native language.

I selected it based on TA reviews and its location on the river. The location was perfect - right opposite the Friedrichstrasse U-Bahn and S-Bahn (one stop from Central station) with access to everywhere from the Eastside Gallery to the Berlin Philharmonic from the station just across the road. It is VERY central, easy walking distance (2 to 20 mins), to the major attractions of museums, galleries, Checkpoint Charlie etc. We stayed six nights and were upgraded to \"the level\", which colours my review as the service received well exceeded the reasonable deal I got by booking early. The room on the 7th floor had a great view and a fully opening window/door. Unlike my original booking, this included breakfast and the buffet here (on the Level) exceeded any I've eaten anywhere, including the Windsor Hotel in Melbourne, which is outstanding. The range of food, from cereals to eggs that could be cooked to order, to beautiful smoked salmon, camembert etc etc was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Staff at reception and on \"the Level\" were very helpful with putting our postage box together and arranging to post our cards. There are two computers and a printer available on our floor, and others, I think, in the lobby. My only criticism of this place was the wifi access. It was available, but not free - for a smartphone it was 9 euros, more for a laptop or iPad, and had to be paid per device i.e. two people want to both access email on their own phone, they have to pay twice. You don't stay connected automatically, which was also annoying, although you seemed not to have to put the password in every time. If the rest of the service had not been brilliant, this would have brought the hotel down to 4 star in my opinion.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location and a Very Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jersey1977", "ReviewID": "UR85182623", "Content": "A+ location in the heart of Berlin in close proximity to everything.

My friend and I arrived and waited for someone at the desk to serve us - which wasn't too long. The place wasn't overly busy but the two staff who were manning the reception desk were busy dealing with phonecalls and other hotel guests. We arrived there at circa 11am and were given rooms - so great result - no waiting around. The porter took our luggage and took it to our rooms who was a lovely Ethiopian chap who spoke excellent ... fluent English and showed us around the room and all it's functions. We stayed in rooms on the 3rd floor. Considering we both had single rooms the rooms were very big and the the bed appeared to be two single beds pushed together we made for a very wide bed. However the the bedding was also for single beds ... so no double duvet - strange?! The single duvet aren't comfortable and kept falling off - why not have a large duvet since the room has two single beds oushed together??!! There were footprints in the room, which I thought was odd... not my footprint. I think they ned to give the carpet a very good clean. We wanted to go to lunch and did have designs on going to the tapas restaurant in the hotel - despite my protestations to my friend given the reviews on Trip Advisor I'd read before coming. In the foyer on the way to the tapas bar, we happened upon the porter who suggested that we go out and eat in the main shopping areas rather than eat in the tapas bar as he didn't consider it to be very good! So I was particularly pleased he said this given my initial reservations. So we ended up eating in a cafe called Boulevard Friedrichstrasse which served German food was excellent and of very high quality. After going for a walk in the evening we had a coffee in the cafe/bar attached to the hotel, which was ok and fairly non-descript. I then went to check out the gym which is located on the 8th Floor. The gym was less than inspired. The equipment looed like that of a hom gym rather than a professional hotel gym. The free weights consist of two dumbells - I am quite disappointed as I used a lot of suitcase space on my gym clothes!

We looked through similar reviews and were still unsure of where to stay, but staying in the Mitte area of the city was a briliant choice. LOCATION After landing, the train station is right next to the airport, just a 2 minute walk. There is an express train every half an hour that stops at most of the major tourist sposts and costs just 2-3 euros each (the same trip by taxi is 50 euros per cab, no comparison), four stops and just another 20 mins later you get off at the station; \"Friedrichstra\u00dfe\". Walk out of the station and 150 yards towards the river and you get the the Melia hotel, close enough for easy commuting and yet far enough never to hear one single train. The transport system as a whole is great, you can buy a day pass if you wish which costs about 6 euros each and this alows unlimited travel on buses, trains and the underground. To be honest though, depending on your itinery, most of the areas area accesable by a 20 min walk. Checkpoint Charlie, the Brandenburg Gate, TV Tower, The Reichstag and many more are even less. My advice is don't waste your money on the open top bus tours, take a 1 hour boat trip up the River Spree and you will get to see where the main highlights are situated (the stop for this is right outside the hotel lobby, the 4 hour one would be too long as there isn;'t enough sites to fill the time). HOTEL ROOM You probably know now that i loved the location so onto the hotel itself. From the moment you walk into the lobby untill the second you check out you will see that there is little or nothing to complian about. The checking in part was simple and quick and the hotel is imaculately clean. We booked into a Comfort room but as i had heard reviews on the Level Rooms i decided to enquire on arrival. The receptionist explained that the suppliment for this room was 60 euros a night which i was reluctant to pay as the hotel had already cost us enough but i asked to be shown the room available. The standard rooms are all on floors 1-6 whilst the Level (executive) is on the 7th. The rooms are spacious, recently modernised, air conditioned and kept spotless. They are also realy well insulated and stop any noise passing through the walls. These rooms are larger, they face the river, they have complimentary bath robes etc and best of all you get use of the executive Lounge. EXECTUTIVE LOUNGE The lounge provides breakfast up until 10 am where continental, British and Spanish foods are available along with a selection of inclusive hot and cold drinks, including champagne. From 11am untill 6pm they put out and top up a wide selection of soft drinks, hot and also beers. Finally from 6pm to 11pm they provide the same but also spirits and a wide selection of Spanish snacks which always differ and taste outstanding. Through the exec restaraunt there is a relaxing lounge whhich is just like being at home with great views. In here there is a TV and lots of different daily newspapers. A point to make is that i never saw any children on the Level or in the lounge areas so it may be worth checking out if they are permitted. If you arent in the exec rooms then you have to eat on the ground floor, the times to do so are shorter and there is a lot less choice. Also a free newspaper is sent to your room everyday. BOOK IT RESTARAUNTS If i'm honest the first of our three nights, we arrived late-ish so just sat in the exec lounge and filled up on the snacks supplied. However, the second night, we decided to eat in one of the hotels restaraunts. We chose the Spanish tapas one which was a typical type but the quality, presentation and value was well worth it. There was a second international restaraunt on the 1st floor but we never got to try it, don't be put off this hotel if you read bad reports of the food because we can vouch for it and if Spanish isn't your choice then there are pleanty of places to eat outside the hotel, all within a five minute walk. NIGHTLIFE If you are like us and enjoy a leisurly stroll at night, eat out and try a few bars then this place is perfect. As i say places to eat are close and easy to find (Saturday was rather busy so not a bad day to eat in), and on the other side of the river Spree there is a quaint river side street with several bars to sit back relax and drink, or dine if you so wish. BEWARE!!!!! On the other side of the river is a restaraunt called The Grill which is a really lovely looking place but be prepared to pay the earth, it cost 70 euros for a Steak and Vodka with Cranberry Juice, and to be honest the steak was discusting. I made the mistake of not checking the prices first and got caught. For that i wanted a cow. Apart from this all the rest were fine and value for money so don't be afraid to try the local cuisine. POINTS TO NOTE: 1) 1hr cruise, not the 4hr. 2) Don't take the night one as there isn't much light along the river so you won't see many sights. 3) Tell the hotel staff its a special occasion and they will treat you like royalty. 4) Visit the TV tower in the day as the views are great. 5) Stay away from taxis. 6) Stay in the Level if you like peace and quiet. 7) Try the hotels food on the Saturday as twn is busy. 8) Pay a trip to Alexanderplatz for hustle and bustle and also the museums.", "Date": "August 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Braunschweig", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "sir_felix1", "ReviewID": "UR76454352", "Content": "This hotel in the heart of Berlin is in perfect location next to trainstop Friedrichstra\u00dfe, about 15 easy minutes nice walk to Brandenburger Tor.

The hotel is perfect very comfortable and within walking distance to everywhere. Unter den Linden and all historical sights can be reached in moments on foot or by S-bahn,U-bahn and buses100 and 200 which go everywhere and are a stone away from the hotel.The trams which also run to the east side of Berlin go up and down Friedrichstrasse in front of the hotel. Boats up and down the Spree river also begin next to the hotel bridge. And of course coming from the airport and having to carry your luggage only 50 metres to your hotel is very relaxing. Dont bother taking the breakfast deal ,15 euros per person is a lot of money when you have everything around you.Great breakfast and lunch room just next the hotel a great Starbucks a few steps away a fantastic bakery across the street all open all day long. And Rossman supermarket just across the street.No problem about having breakfast or coffee anytime you wake up! The only very annoying thing I must rever to about the hotel is the very late cleaning of the rooms. When you return exhausted from your daily sightseeing at about 4.30 it is very annoying to find the staff in your room still working and needing about an hour more to finish without you being able to go even to the toilet!!!!!When I complained at the reception and said that the children needed to rest they apologised and noted down that they will tell the staff to do our rooms earlier since we go out very early in the morning and return this time. The next day the same situation ended up with me having to find the lady in charge of the cleaning staff on the second floor who of course was very embarised and apologised and sent someone right away when I explained that I had kindly asked the reception for a second time to send someone and had been waiting for over an hour to have the childrens room cleaned and keeping them meanwhile in my room without them being able to take their shoes off. All the family wasent able to rest that afternoon the time was nearly 6oclock in the afternoon and because of the outragious behaviour of the reception training boy?????? we had lost our afternoon rest which is very important when you are on vacation and have made a program which has to be kept if you want your family to have a nice time. I thought of mentioning it to the hotel manager but that would probably mean losing even more precious time.

Also at the end of the block going into the center underneath all the railway arches there's a few good places to eat there. Tours are a must and Brewers tours from outside Bandy Brooks Ice Cream place are fab. We did the 3rd Reich tour and Tony is a mine of information - make sure you have comfy shoes on as this tour will last about 5-6 hours! Also, walking tours in English were really good - we did the cold war tour and it was fascinating as it shows all the areas where there is still loads of the wall standing. After the tour we went to the Stasi Museum which is at the old stasi headquaters - it's very atmospheric. I would have liked it more if there had been english translations for the displays but you can get the gist of what's been going on as there are thousands of photos! Also don't forget to go to the holocaust memorial - it's really interesting and very well put together. Museum island is great - you absolutely must go and see the newly opened Altes Museum which has the bust of Nefertiti which is stunning. The museum itself was amazing.

The Melia staff were polite and helpful.

The cost of extras such as wi-fi, mini-bar, movies and breakfast was high - apart from the wi-fi we didn't really mind any of this. Finally we made the mistake of eating tapas in the restaurant one evening - my advice is stay away! The ding of the microwave along with the speed at which our food was brought to the table set the alarm bells ringing in my head. I understand that restaurants often pre-prepare items however I do not accept that every single item in a large order should be reheated in a microwave before serving. Not one single plate we ordered was freshly cooked. Worse my garlic chicken came out hot on the outside and cold in the middle. Worse again I found a large lump of a plastic bag in another dish. When I called this to the attention of our waitress she giggled and said she would replace the chicken. Now I firmly believe that if a diner's food is returned cold then the serving staff should make it a priority to reheat and re-serve the dish. Not here. As the minutes ticked by I watched our waitress dance in front of the 'chef' (microwave operator might be a more accurate job title) who was obviously on a break. Twenty minutes later I called her over and asked her to forget the chicken and just to bring the bill.

No noise from within the hotel either despite being close to the lifts which was good as there is nothing worse than listening to every toilet flush and bath running etc. Service was excellent and friendly throughout.The light went out above the shower and was replaced immediately and we were able to keep our room until 4 p.m. as we had a late afternoon return flight. Breakfast and evening drinks (with tapas selection) in The Level lounge were first class. In fact I would definitely recommend staying on The Level as if you book sufficiently well in advance you can pay the same as you would for an ordinary room without an included breakfast. The bathroom was modern, spotlessly clean and a triumph for German/Spanish (?)plumbing and tiling. Room had tea/coffee making facilities which were replenished daily as well as a mini bar which was not really necessary given the drinks available in the lounge. If I was going to be really \u2018picky\u2019 the bed, despite having good quality linens and pillow menu was a little bit unyielding for my taste and not quite as comfortable as some North American chain hotels offer. However, this would not stop me staying here again. In fact 4 days is nowhere near long enough to see all the sights and sounds of such a modern, progressive and vibrant city - so we will definitely be back. Incidentally, we felt very safe walking around at all times, our only minor gripe was the entrance costs for galleries/museums (in the region of \u20ac12 each), but then we are suffering from poor currency exchange rates and spoilt by the fact many museums in London are free.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo Japan", "Title": "\u201cA great choice\u201d", "Author": "Aussie_in_Tokyo", "ReviewID": "UR65790302", "Content": "Have just come back from a two week trip in Germany and Paris, Melia was definetely the best value for money on this trip and in a long time Very impressed with this hotel on many levels Everyone has already said it, but I will say it again; great location, nice strolls to many of the sites, public transport on your doorstep room, was really good, great size and fantastic bed, the wife was really impressed with the bathroom breakfast, one of the most impressive selections I have ever seen, and fantastic quality service was for the most part really good and on top of this was at a great price", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, great base for sightseeing, very helpful staff.\u201d", "Author": "Lovemyholidays88", "ReviewID": "UR65721140", "Content": "We stayed at the Melia Berlin for four nights, Monday through Friday.

Breakfast is also expensive but there are several nice breakfast spots in the immediate area ( i.e. Alt Berlin across the river to the north).

The location is excellent, about a block from a major subway & streetcar station (Friedrichstrasse) and an 8-10 minute walk to Unter den Linden with all its historical sites. Easy to find both good restaurants and cheap eats right in the vicinity. We paid 80-90 euros a night through agoda.com, which I found almost hard to believe for a hotel of this quality and location in a city like Berlin. I was prepared for something to go wrong when I paid the bill at the end. But it was just as advertised. The hotel is newish and right on the Spree River. Our room looked out at construction of a very ugly, huge, dark-colored new building across the street, but looking sideways we could see the river. The style of the hotel is simple, clean, and elegant. Desk, bell, and concierge service was always cordial and helpful. Our standard room was always clean, well furnished, and not luxurious in space but definitely not cramped for 2 women with luggage who did some shopping as well. The bathroom was also clean, new, and bright, just what I expect from a good, modern hotel in Europe. Importantly, we had peace and quiet with no exceptions. I was a little worried because our room was right across from the elevator, but I never once heard a sound. This could be also because the hotel was not full, but still I think the soundproofing is very good. I needed Internet access to stay in touch with work, and I paid 88 euro for a 7-day package--highway robbery compared to the many US hotels that provide free Internet, but not a dealbreaker for me. If I didn't need it for work, I probably would have skipped it and just used my mobile device access. The only slight inconvenience was that we arrived in the morning after a long flight and, although the hotel was happy to keep our luggage, we checked back several times and were not able to check in until the official 3 p.m. checkin time. There was plenty to do within an easy walk in the meantime (stroll to Unter den Linden, see the Brandenburg gate, have a coffee and excellent light meal at Kaffee Einstein - Unter den Linden), etc., but we were weary and in need of a shower. This just confirmed my general rule of trying to arrive in the late afternoon/evening on a long trip, but this time the $400 round trip airfare was more enticing than the perfectly convenient setup.

It\u2019s a nice, modern hotel just right next to Freidrichstr. U- and S-bahn station. It takes about 30 minutes from Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport with the express train. Check-in was taken care of swiftly. Normally check-in time 15:00, but I was able to check-in at 12:00. The room was modern, spacious with a huge kingsize bed that takes up most of it. The bed was comfortable and they even had a pillow menu detailing the pillow stuffing for all the different pillows. Even though the room faced Freidrichstrasse, it was very quiet. It probably helped that the room was on the 7th floor. As for The Level treats they had a nice tray with complimentary chocolates and a bottle of water. They restocked the water every day. There\u2019s a kettle for making coffe and tea. The bathroom was smallish but nice. They provided bathrobes and slippers. The shower was squeezed into the bathtub. To my surprise I found ashtrays in the room. It turned out that I was given a smoking room, even though I booked a non-smoking room. I asked about this, and they said that they were fully booked and my notice for a non-smoking was just a preference. They offered to try and switch the room for the second night, but I couldn't be bothered moving for just one night. As it turned out it was barely noticeable and didn't bother me. But if your asthmatic or really want assurance for a non-smoking room I would send them a separate notice for a non-smoking room. Included in The Level room was access to the Executive club lounge. There you have the choice of breakfast in the club lounge or in the restaurant. Coffe, tea and softdrinks were served all day. Between 18:00-22:00 you\u2019re able to enjoy tapas and alcoholic drinks. They also have two computers with internet and printing capabilities available for guests. You can also conveniently check-out at the club lounge. Breakfast is served until 11.00. I tried visiting the lounge for breakfast on a Sunday at 10.00, but it was already packed with guests. I was guided to the restaurant instead. The restaurant had only a few seats available, so at these peak hours for a late weekend breakfast was a little too crowded for my taste. The breakfast it self was plentiful with hot and cold items. Personally I liked that they had a good selection of darker breads. Also it\u2019s always a treat when you can order freshly made omelettes. As a summary the Melia aspires to be like a nicer Hilton or Marriott. However it doesn't quite reach those levels.

Very modern hotel with many extras. Location-convenient to everything-very safe area on river-just north of Friedrichstrasse train station-one stop east of Hautbahnhof on several lines-Unter den Linden just a few blocks away- located in former East Berlin where most of the sights and museums are located. I will definitely stay here the next time if I can get a good rate and especially a great one like I had for 75 euros plus 20 euros for 2 breakfasts. All negatives were minor and were completely insignificant compared to all the pluses. My rating of 4 would probably have been a 5 if they offered a free internet station (at least give a guest card for 15 minutes per day so one can check important stuff but prevent people from staying on for hours) Room #504-No view-courtyard so very quiet-might have been nice to have river side view -2 beds (very nice-good pillows with 3 different sizes-duvet cover very soft and comfortable. -flat screen tv with many channels mostly German but others too -small modern sofa-more like an exam table at the doctor\u2019s office -minibar w/ refrigerator-didn\u2019t use minibar -closet w/ free safe-very good plus 2 chairs and a small table -bathroom-very nice with toilet, bidet (didn\u2019t use), good size sink, tub w/ shower and half glass door but no issue if closed properly -ample plugs but not one usable by head of bed (see negatives) Breakfast \u2013 best one I\u2019ve ever had in a hotel-very good but very expensive (get MaS Rewards card which makes breakfast 2 for 1 so 10 euros each rather than 20 euros) Very, very large fresh selection: several types of eggs, meats, fruits, pastries, yogurts. Coffee, tea, juices, water and even champagne both mornings I was there) Excellent service by wait staff! Negatives 1)No free internet in lobby or elsewhere in hotel-as you can tell, this upset me the most-sister hotel, Tryp Buenos Aires, where I stayed in May had two free stations by breakfast area 2)Key must be in slot by door for electricity to work (only TV worked w/o it) which meant hot/stuffy room upon return for quite a while depending on outside temp 3)Light on minibar on same switch as 2 floor lamps. If you want to use outlet by bed, it will only work if light above minibar is on also-no way to turn that off just by itself Tip: Make sure all windows are closed because a/c will not work otherwise. It will keep shutting off. This is possibly why previous reviewer has \u201cair con hell\u201d I felt stupid after I called the front desk to fix it, and the nice guy found that the window was ajar-why maid opened it he didn't know. Suggestion/Recommendation: Take the \u201cFree Walking Tour\u201d \u2013just over 3 hours and starts just east of Brandenburg Gate. We had Colin from Scotland-excellent and entertaining. We each tipped 20 euros although others were cheap. I saw 1 older lady just give him a coin! Many young adults-hostel crowd-so don\u2019t expect them to tip big-not in their budget-but those over 35 should give more. It\u2019s well worth 20 euros or more for the great service and knowledge gained. One of the best city tours I\u2019ve ever taken anywhere. No hopping on and off busses plus they have a \"free Bicycle tour\" also. English tours at 11 am, noon, and 2 pm.

I booked well in advance and was attracted to this hotel as it was almost brand new and was well located to most of the historical sites around Berlin. I always compare the tariffs available from the various booking agencies and finally compare them to the hotel website. If I can book direct with the hotel at equal, or better price, then this is the way I go. In this instance I got the best price by booking a superior room direct online, which also included breakfast. We travelled from Amsterdam by train to Berlin and had an horrendous trip with a suicide up the line forcing all passengers off the train and bused to an alternative train station where we then took a further 4 trains before arriving in Berlin nearly 3 hours later than expected. By the time we arrived at the hotel we were very hot, bothered and tired so we appreciated the warm and courteous welcome and a fast check-in. Even better when my special request for a room on the higher floors with a view over the river Spree was provided. The room was very spacious with a pleasant decor, large comfortable bed with an abundance of pillows and a large modern bathroom. The view over the river was very relaxing and the heavily insulated glass window/doors kept out any noise from the street below, yet could be opened for fresh air. As it was now after 9pm we decided to use the hotel dining room rather than wander around looking for suitable restaurants. Some prior reviews indicated that the hotel dining room was not the greatest and when we entered to find that only one table was occupied in the huge room we had second thoughts. I am glad that we stayed because the meal and the service provided was one of the best we had in 6 weeks of travelling around Europe and the cost was reasonable.Not being familiar with european wines we were also delighted with the waiter's recommendation after we described the characteristics of the type of wine we prefer. The same huge dining room was used for breakfast which was excellent with a wide and varied choice. You could even have champagne if this is the way you prefer to start the day. Location was just as I had expected. A short walk to the SBahn which was important to us as we were travelling by train to Munich after leaving Berlin. Also we had to join a walking tour the next morning only 1 rail stop away. Just across the river was a string of reasonable quality and popular restaurants which we sampled on the next 2 nights. Besides these restaurants was a small park where an impromptu fireworks display lit up the immediate area for about 15 minutes on the next night, which we enjoyed from the comfort of our room. We also took a river cruise with its departure point right in front of the hotel. The staff we encountered during our stay were friendly. We find that it always helps to try and greet them using our best attempt at there own language and treat them the way we would like to be treated - always works, and the excellent service and response to our requests flows from there. When we checked out we said that we had had a very enjoyable stay at the hotel and would have said so in writing if their feedback form was in english as well as german. Berlin is an interesting place to visit, but probably not a city that we would come back to again and again.

It is close to a train station and is about a ten minute walk away from the Brandenburg Gate. The check-in went smoothly. All the desk clerks spoke acceptable English. The room was acceptably large and clean. The bed was large and comfortable. The bathroom was large and clean. The selection of TV channels in English was miserable. About all they had that was sort of worth watching in English was a British news channel. I was particularly amazed by an English language channel that contained only programming about what a great place mainland China was and what a wonderful government it had. It was pure propaganda and nothing else. Maybe it was a holdover from the days of East Germany. I never saw anything quite like it. That was their idea of what their English speaking guests would want to watch? It is incredible they could be that out of touch. Our guide suggested avoiding the hotel restaurants. He said they were expensive, had very slow service and their food was not all that great. They were virtually empty the whole time we were there, which seemed to confirm our guide was not the only one holding that opinion. Anyway, there were many restaurants within easy walking distance of the hotel. It was Sunday and the banks and about every other business (except the restaurants) were closed. I tried to change money at the desk, since all the banks were closed. The clerk said she didn't have any cash to do that. We had to go quite a way to find a restaurant that took credit cards. Most did not, making me think that part of East Berlin had not fully picked up the business practices of the West. That meal cost twice as much as what we paid the next night at a much closer, just as good restaurant, where we paid cash. There was supposed to be wireless internet in the room, but I couldn't get a signal. There was cable internet, which I couldn't get to work -- probably me not knowing how to do it. There were three computers in the lobby, supposedly available for about six dollars for half an hour. However, when I went to get my pass word at the desk, the clerk said they were out of order. I asked her when she thought they might be working again. She got pretty annoyed by that question and said she had no idea. However, the computers did work late the next morning and I was able to successfully get on the internet for my six dollar half hour. There were no ice machines. The front desk clerk said to get ice at the bar. However, the bar tender acted like I was crazy when I asked for some ice. He sent me to the restaurant, where I found no one. I went back to the desk, where the clerk asked me why I hadn't gone to the bar. When I told her the bar had refused, she sent a bell hop to the restaurant. He found a waiter outside and after a long conversation, he said he'd get me some ice from the kitchen. I waited some fifteen minutes, during which time I saw him hauling luggage. He finally came up with a small bucket of ice. I didn't try to get ice again after that. I can't say anyone was ever out and out rude to us. However, sometimes requests for help or service brought a rolling of eyes and a disgusted look. There were no shops in the hotel. The closest shops were in the train station, about a block away. There was an included hot breakfast. The selection and quality of the food was excellent. The service personnel spoke no English, but they kept the food stocked and the tables clean. This hotel was not horrible by any means. However, it just was not up to American standards. Maybe its being in the former East Germany is the reason it just didn't seem to have its act together when it came to catering to guests and having amenities you come to expect in most hotels -- even abroad. Melia may not be a company with its roots in the former East German, but the people who work there and manage it likely are. To all appearances, they have a lot to learn about the niceties many guests expect. While it was not the nightmare we have run into at other hotels where we have stayed a few times in the past (like the totally horrible one where we stayed in Naples [e.g., bed bugs, no air conditioning] a couple years back), we would never stay at the Berlin Melia again.", "Date": "July 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitehead , Co.

Stayed at the Melia from 11/07/07 until 16/07/07 with wife and 2 other friends. We had 2 rooms on The Level. These were excellent if a little small. All the fittings were first class and the room was kept in first class condition. Bathroom was excellent. Lots of soaps etc. Cleaned morning and evening, fresh towels twice per day. Staff were on duty all day to assist if required. In the evening from 6.00P.M. tapas and a range of wines, spirits and soft drinks were availabe on a serve yourself basis. Breakfast is also served here. There is always lots of space. Things might be different outside July/August when businessmen return Had 2 excellent meals in the Cafe Madrid in the hotel. There are a range of restaurants just over the road from the hotel were we ate ouside beside the river Spree. It was great sitting by the riverside watching the tour boats and private cruisers going up and down the river all lit up.The restaurants were really good with great young staff. This hotel is very central and a lot of the main sights are fairly close. If you are a walker Berlin is very flat. We found all the staff at the Melia very helpful especially the staff on The Level. The hotel is also just beside the departure point for river tours. 1 hour city river tours for 8 Euro and longer 31/2 hour tours for 16 Euro are available. On the longer tour which departs at 10.00A.M. and 6.30P.M. a simple range of hot and cold food for purchase is available which is excellent for a meal out on the river. We did both tours, the longer one was the best. The short tour departs hourly all day. The hop on/off bus is the best way to see the sights-15-20Euro for all day. I was amazed at the size of Berlin. Its vast, and there are waterways and canals everywhere. Berlin will have to catch up as regards providing literature and tours for non Germans. I found it difficult to get tour details. The hotel had lots of literature but only very basic details in English. Hard luck for those who do not speak German or English. In fact all the tours I went on were for Germans with English as an add on. I found only 1 chap, a South African, who provided tours exclusively in Enlish using a mini bus. He was excellent ant took us on a Berlin city tour lasting 3 hours He showed us absolutely everything in places where the larger bus cannot go. He agreed that Berlin is unfortunately far from the standard found in Paris, Madrid, Rome etc as regards tours and info for non nationals. However, I found Berlin great and everywhere is clean. The taxis are great. One last word about the Melia. When we left for the airport my wife forgot her cardigan and left it in reception. Luckily I had the telephone number of The Level and rang them. The girls went and found the item and despatched it to the Airport and even paid the taxi. Service indeed!!!

The Melia is also located next to the River Spee - see photos.Very picturesque from my window.Unfortunately,a site is being cleared beside the river which may limit views from the hotel in the near future.On the other hand , there did not seem to be any foundations being prepared so it may (one hopes) be used for amenity space. The room on The Level (floor 7)was very spacious and modern.The bed was massive with numerous choices of pillows. The bathroom was again large and well equiped.The bathrobe actually fitted a normal sized person !. Food in the hotels first floor main restaurant (on 1 meal ) was at a very reasonable standard for a hotel.In the wine list the Spanish wines were expensive arguably: the German wines were better value.For outside meals close to the hotel cross the bridge(ie out of town)and turn immediate left along the riverbank about 50m just past the theatre .The are approx 3 gastro style pubs and a similar no. of restaurants who prima facie cater for theatregoers. A meal in one we found good value and enjoyable.Refer to the photos again, you can see the riverside restaurants from the upstairs hotel rooms. One aspect of The Level is worthy of mention.The hotel operates a business class airport style dining area/lounge on the 7th floor for those residents who are on the 7th and 8th floors.You take your breakfast there separately from the other guests.Self service but a reasonable choice with staff very attentive.In the evening drinks and tapas are free in the lounge.On our !st night drinks and tapas were in plentiful supply.By contrast on the following night ,drinks and tapas were rather meagre.This was disappointing since the hotel had created the expectation.

Berlin is a fabulous city ,go ,and stay at the Melia while the rate lasts but beware one of the reception staff he was the most unfriendly,unhelpful downright ignorant person i'd met in a long time,but he was the exception and he made me laugh,sadly i didn't get his name, but you will know him i promise, always has a piece of paper in his hand.", "Date": "February 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cSuprisingly great value\u201d", "Author": "Canadian_in_London28", "ReviewID": "UR6813205", "Content": "Booked this hotel due to it's good reviews on tripadvisor.com and a great rate on Expedia.

With a suite you get free soft-drinks and beer all day, a great breakfast (literally really great), enough tapas at night that we skipped dinner, and a really nice room near the top floor.

We got a very good deal on --- and it was excellent value for money. Our first happy surprise was how close it is to Friedrichstra\u00dfe train station, just right across the road. The station seemed to be a central point with a lot of connections throughout the city. Location wise the hotel was good for an exploring base as if you turn left out of the hotel you are immediately in the main shopping vicinity, however, to the right it was quite dark at night time and didn\u2019t seem as built up. Check-in was very quick with very helpful staff that spoke excellent English and helped us with all queries throughout our stay. The rooms are very very clean with a nice bright decor, although they probably look smaller than they actually were due to the HUGE bed!! (haha), which was EXTREMELY comfortable with loads of pillows. Again the bathroom was very clean with plenty of towel and was always warm. Compared to another Four Star hotel we stayed in while in Berlin, Melia was well above the standard. So, things to do while in Berlin. We\u2019d highly recommend the New Berlin tours some of which are offered everyday of the year, regardless of the weather (---p.com). Visit Potsdamer Platz where the Sony Centre is located with lots of bars, restaurants and a cinema with films in English. Try the Australian restaurant/bar here, it\u2019s delicious \u2013 get a Death By Chocolate!!! And of course all the other usual sites such as Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie which are within walking distance.", "Date": "February 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cIdeal Location at a good price.\u201d", "Author": "bofcof", "ReviewID": "UR6699402", "Content": "No doubt the price of the hotel will go up as it becomes established. We got a very good deal direct from hotel web-site that included the price of breakfast, we were also delighted with the free upgrade to a superior room on arrival. Concierge staff were polite and efficient and check-in was quick even though we arrived 2 hrs earlier than the normal check-in time. Room spotless, and bright. Liked the flower in a vase in the bathroom and the modern square sink. Umpteem pillows on the bed. Breakfast buffet was a good spread although was surprised to see no muesli in a German hotel? A good choice of cooked and cold dishes, were to be had. Location in walking distance of Museum Island (5 min) the Reichstag (about 10min) Brandenburg Gate and other places of interest. The hotel is at the far end of Freidericstrasse which has some very good shopping galleries such as Lafayette and Galleries 5 and 6 are worth checking out. Also walking distance to Gendarm Platz. Having toured Berlin and the sights I wouldnt choose it above any other major European city so think twice before picking it as a city break, but if you are well travelled and are thinking of where to go, its worth a visit but do include nearby Potsdam on your trip (easy to do by bus or train ) which is far more attractive.

Staff always helpful and service very good. Only criticisms are that the bar is in an open plan lobby and seemed underused as did the Tapas bar and restaurant. Perhaps the reason for this was the other bars and restaurants nearby. Just over the river the Ganymed Brasserie was top class if a little expensive, The Standige Vertretung was a big hit for beers and wholesome German food. Also across the bridge at Friedrichstrasse 113, Ristorante Peretti served up top class pasta dishes and mammoth pizzas at very low cost. Beware of the cost of extras in the hotel, Bar drinks, mini bar etc. If not travelling alone sign up fot the MAS card (free) which provodes a free breakfast for a second person.
