{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A taste of the French Quarter We lucked out during our first trip to New Orleans by staying at the French Quarter Hotel Annex. Our suite had a beautiful living room, bed room, full kitchen and great bathroom. The rooms were clean and even though the kitchen was not well stocked with supplies, the hotel staff was willing to supply anything we needed. The suite was located in an older home on North Rampart 2 blocks away from the main hotel. There was convenient parking at the sight and it was a quick walk to the French Quarter. It took us only 15 minutes to get to the River Walk on Canal Street! The hotel staff were fabulous and very helpful in suggesting tours, restaurants, etc. They also provided an umbrella when it was raining! I have stayed many places around the world and would rate this experience in the top 5. If you are looking for a real taste of the French Quarter experience I would highly recommend this hotel. We had our teenagers with us and they also loved the hotel. We felt very safe and never experienced any problems. The continental breakfast at the main hotel was enough to keep us going until we could nab some great food in the French Quarter. When I return to New Orleans this is where I'll be staying!", "Date": "Mar 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR681815629", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d553441-r3285503-French_Quarter_Annex-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "553441", "Price": "$480"}}
