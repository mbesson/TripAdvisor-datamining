From the moment of my arrival, I felt that the entire staff went above and beyond to ensure that I enjoyed my stay. The hotel is spotlessly clean, and has everything you could ask for. The rooms are more than adequate, and the breakfast is superb. In addition, they offer very competitive rates. If there is one drawback, it may be the location, as it is not centrally located. However, it is so easy to get in and out of the city centre, this should not have any bearing on your decision.

We arrived early from our flight, but the staff did their best to check us in early. In the end, we were eager to investigate the city, so left them bags in storage. The rooms were neat, tidy and compact. I had requested a quiet room, and was given an end of corridor location on a high floor which was great. Staff were all very professional and very helpful with information about the area, all spoke great english. The location is decent, within a 5/10 minute walk of the port area, which has plenty of good bars and restaurants. From there its a slightly longer walk into the city centre, but still is a nice area along the beach. The only slight concerns I had with the hotel was the expensive breakfast at \u20ac12pp - there is a great bakery within 2 minutes walking distance which was much more reasonable.

The taxi cost 28euros which included all fayres/additional charges. We managed to return to the airport on our way home using public transport (very easily) as we had more idea of where we were going and it cost 50% less than getting a taxi. We were pleasantly greeted by the staff who were friendly and very helpful throughout our stay. Again, as it was late and we didn't know the area, we decided to get some room service - pizza & sangria (a must) which was lovely. ACCOMMODATION: The hotel is brilliant, really modern and well looked after in every way. Lovely bathroom with all the amenities you need including: free wifi (hit of miss, but still works fine) air con (we had problems with this, however as soon as we informed the staff they fixed this from the reception desk) tv (with a couple of english channels - channel 4 and some news stations) ice machines on every floor. & a mini bar LOCATION : The hotel is situated along the newly refurbished costal area, which may not be slap bang in the middle of 'La Rambla' however if you want to get into the city centre you have 2 great options a) By Foot - Take a 30-40 minute walk along the beach into the city centre. We did this most days as we are more than happy to walk places b) Metro - the metro station we used was 'ciutadella vila olimpica' this station is a 10 minute walk away from the hotel and takes you into the city centre in a matter of minutes Also, if you choose to get an open top bus tour, there is a pick up / drop off stop within 1 minutes walk of the hotel TIPS: - Cheap food/booze - if you go to la rambla (which is a place we found ourselves visiting every day) you must go to a supermarket called 'Carrefour express' where you can buy 6 small bottles of cider for 1.30euros and wine from as little as 0.93euros! (it depends how fussy you are as to what you think of it, but we really liked the wine, even more so as it was so cheap!!) ** we found ourselves eating out for lunch around 3/4pm then taking some food to the hotel with us from this supermarket to eat for tea e.g baguettes, salami, olives, crisps and salad - all for very cheap!! ** - Eating Tapas & Paelle on La Rambla - This was one of the top 10 things we were told to avoid by our 'top 10 Barcelona' book however you can get plenty of good deals. One thing you need to confirm before sitting down is that you can choose your tapas dishes as we were given random dishes on our first experience. We were more sure of ourselves the second time around and got exactly what we wanted. Its a brilliant experience sitting in the sun, eating gorgeous food, drinking sangria with your partner and enjoying the views and sounds. definitely do it! - Shopping / BARTER, BARTER, BARTER!! - if you want to get souvenirs, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THE MAIN STRIP ON THE LA RAMBLA! across the road (either side of the strip) there are plenty of souvenir shops where the shop keepers will offer you discounts to literally anything inside their shop if you pick an item up. most items we managed to get for around 40% off the labeled price. It makes a massive difference to your trip :) KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR POSSESSIONS - we read loads of articles of advice stating how dangerous Barcelona as an area was for people getting their items stolen. I don't think it is any different to any other capital city i've ever visited, you just have to be vigilant and careful/sensible with your items. Don't panic! I hope this review comes in useful to your trip. It's a beautiful city.

I was sitting in a taxi about to set off when one of the clerks rushed out and accused me of trying to leave without paying the bill. The room was pre-paid, so all this fuss was for a few bottles of water from the minibar and one light lunch. Didn't leave one with a good feeling.

We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel - took about 20 mins and was 32 Euros. We did the same on the way back to the airport - there is always a taxi either outside the hotel, or not very far away, so getting a taxi wasn't a problem. We arrived on the 1st March for 3 nights, so you are still looking at it being pretty quiet at this time. Check in at the Hotel is pretty slow as far as check-ins go, I really don't know why it was so slow, they just seemed to take ages in dealing with every Customer, it was slow for us, and we also noticed it on several occasions when new guests arrived, I would imagine it would be pretty chaotic when really busy. But, Reception staff particularly the ladies were very helpful and friendly, the male receptionists weren't quite so user friendly!! We have stayed in both the Junior Suite and the Jacuzzi Suite and if you are torn between which one to book! Go for the Jacuzzi Suite - gorgeous. Very large bright room with massive super king bed, mirrored walls, and large Jacuzzi Bath. One point about the bathrooms which I think could be improved on is that they have a soap dispenser on the wall and a shamphoo/shower gel dispenser in the shower (both of which were hopeless and never worked, despite being full), the dispensers are pretty tacky and I think toileteries would be a nicer touch - or dispensers that worked? The Jacuzzi Suite was on the 6th floor and pretty quiet, but, the Junior Suite was on the 3rd Floor, and we found the road noise pretty noticable, the traffic never stops outside the hotel. We stayed Bed and Breakfast, I was surprised at the variety on offer at breakfast - very good, although, the cooked breakfast items were usually just pretty luke warm. One thing that was a little strange is that the bar is in the breakfast/restaurant room, so, we did find that of an evening it lacked in atmosphere, I think if they invested in a separate bar area it would be more appealing, you almost felt like you were having a drink in a cafeteria. The outside Pool area is nice, particularly the large gazebos with comfy sofas, although pretty cold of a night, perhaps some heaters would be nice out there? The swimming pool water was absolutely ice cold, no way was anyone going to be using it, Jacuzzi in the same area, and a small gym with sauna and steam room. Again, this area is a bit weird, no proper changing rooms, you had to get changed in the toilet, you are not allowed into the hotel in swim wear, so you have to get changed at the pool area, although there isnt really anywere allocated to get changed. There are 3 computers in the reception area, which are free for guests to use for upto 15 mins per time, which is really handy, we did out on-line check in on these and they even printed out boarding cards for us. All in all a lovely hotel, which was absolutely spotlessly clean - I dont think you could have found a speck of dust or muck if you crawled around all day long on your hands and knees! - so well done to the Cleaners - excellent job - would definately return and would recommend this hotel - not right in the centre of things, a block away from the beach and a good 15/20mins walk into City Centre.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "meromh", "ReviewID": "UR125580713", "Content": "hotel is great, location is a bit away from everything.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nairobi, Kenya", "Title": "\u201cNice location.

We had a twin room. My bed sloped off to the left and my friend's squeaked very loudly every time she moved a muscle. We could feel the springs in the mattresses. The pillows were hard, lumpy and very deep. I had to go and buy a travel pillow to use for my 3 night stay, as the first night there I slept little and woke with a painful neck. I was very disappointed with the overall quality of the rooms. Our first room, despite being on the non-smoking floor, had been used by a smoker. The receptionist changed the room immediately. I know hotels in Barcelona aren't cheap, but for what we paid I had assumed we would get a quality nights sleep. The weather was warm and sunny (18 degrees) and the airconditioning system would only heat our room..to a huge 26 degrees...no cold air was possible. This meant sleeping with the window open all night, with loud traffic outside our window. We were on the street side of the hotel. We didn't have breakfast. The hotel website stated that if you had booked your room more than 20 days in advance that breakfast was free for your stay. We had booked 7 weeks in advance via Booking.com and were told we were not entitled to the free breakfast as we had not booked directly through the hotel. The hotel is 20 minutes by bus from La Ramblas. Adjustable lighting in the room - we never mastered that. In our 4 day stay. Standard naff hotel hairdryer that takes forever to dry your hair. Lovely hot tub. We ran the Barcelona Half Marathon and had a lovely 2 hour soak in the hot tub. This was the deciding factor on choosing this hotel over others. Pool not warm enough to use at this time of year. If it's too cold for children it's definitely too cold for adults! Noce outdoor seating area for lunch or drinks. Amazing burger and chips!

The hotel is a short walk from the Ciutadella via Olympica (excuse my spelling) on the yellow metro line, which you can pick up in the city centre. There are no real street signs that are immediately obvious, but when you come out of the metro station, you basically head straight up the road that is almost directly in front of you - this is Avinguda Icaria. There is a large shopping centre with a supermarket and a few dining options inside (as well as a cinema) close to the hotel, on the opposite side of the road. The hotel is pretty nice and clean. Our room was also clean and the facilities were all very clean and functional. The area is quite quiet, although our hotel neighbours (ie the other residents) were loud and made a great deal of noise arriving back at night.

I do not like taking buses to get to the Metro to get to where I am going. If you stay here you will need a Metro pass. Like others stated, get the 10 pass ticket. Little known fact: you can use the 10 pass for more than one person by passing it back after the first person crosses the barrier. Perfectly legal! We even did this right in front of Metro security with no issues. The Metro pass will get you from the airport to where ever your hotel is, even on the bus as long as you do not exceed 75 minutes. Going from the airport train to the metro (and back) is a little hairy but do able with light luggage.

Alternatively, You can get a bus from right outside the metro and the hotel is just 2 stops away. The actual location of the hotel isn\u2019t great, the ally next to the hotel has car repair and other mechanic shops and looks like a sad place. On the positive side, the city sighseeing bus comes just around the corner so if you plan to take that tour you can board the bus from walking distance. Note there are two different operators running the open-top sight-seeing bus service and our general observation was that frequency on the tour operated bycitysightseeing.com was lesser than the other one. Coming back to the hotel review, the interiors of the hotel are good, the reception staff were nice, we liked the outdoor swimming pool and the pool side table setting \u2013 note the hotel charges 3 euros per person for towels supplied at the pool (this is for the entire trip as opposed to 3 euro per swim). The room itself was nice, we got a pool facing room but it also overlooked upon nearby residences and shops. The room was spacious, and the amenities and room service were excellent. The first day we had ordered dinner in the room, enjoyed the food, and the almond cake was awesome :) The breakfast options were good as well, they had lot many options to choose from. Overall it was a good experience, not an extravagant 4 star hotel, but if you are looking for just a comfy room away from the hustle-bustle of the city center and still easily connected to the city you will like Hotel Icaria.", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kathmandu, Nepal", "Title": "\u201cManish Thapa\u201d", "Author": "Manishthapa293890", "ReviewID": "UR123243061", "Content": "It is a great hotel.

The nearest metro station is only a 10 minute walk and it takes 5 or 10 minutes to get to the centre of Barcelona. It is an amazing city with so much to do but we felt it was nice to go back to the quieter area of the Olympic port at night out of the business of the centre of Barcelona. There are good places to eat and nice areas to go for a walk at the beach. During the day you can spend your time sightseeing using the metro or having a relaxing time at the pool or beautiful beach 5 minutes away so you get the best of both worlds. However, if you are staying for a shorter time you may prefer a more central location. I'd also recommend a visit to the Parc de la Ciutadella which is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel and is near the houses of parliament and the zoo.

However, I have no trouble in admitting they were some of the kindest and most helpful hotel staff I've ever met. The only staff in the hotel that didn't provide an 5-star service was the breakfast host. I am aware that the breakfast rush is a stressful time for the hotel, but his mannerisms were rather curt and by comparison to his co-workers, his work/efforts were sub-standard. The room itself was gorgeous. Spacious, clean and just beautiful. My only complaints here were the following: 1. The light fitting over the desk was broken. Also hung low so my (tall) friend kept hitting his head on it. 2. The 'Double Bed' was actually two singles pushed together, which was fine, but, while not an issue for this trip, obviously one could not sleep near a companion. 3. The mini-bar was not fully stocked with everything that was on the list. 4. There was no 'intro pack' in the room. No information about pool times, dinner times, numbers to call for reception, no TV channel listing. Also only 1-2 channels were in English, which is fair enough, but it would've been nice if we could have taken advantage of the technology in the room. The TV also had no USB port, which would be nice. Again, these are only minor complaints and nothing that detracted from the actual experience. Personally, I loved the location. It was one of my favourite parts about this hotel. It was so close to the beach (2mins to Bogatell/Nova Icaria), and when you realise how compact Barcelona is, not at all far from the city centre either. It was ideal for me because it was quiet. The swimming pool was also very nice. It doesn't however have a \"shallow end\" and a \"deep end\". It just gets a bit deeper in the middle. I'd recommend putting up some safety and warning signs. I saw many children, and even some adults diving into it. For something as shallow as that, it really is an accident waiting to happen. While I understand why, it was a shame that the jacuzzi and pool close at 9pm. 10pm would be fairer, I think. It would give the adults some time to enjoy it without all the children around. Also, a few more loungers wouldn't go amiss. Lastly, 'The Vanity Room' Cocktail Bar was absoloutely stunning and the adjoining terrace was a pleasure to sit in. However, I was disappointed by the lack of variety in the cocktails. There were approx. eight. Not exactly what I would have imagined in such a high class bar. I would most certainly stay here again on a return trip to Barcelona.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSecond Visit - and still excellent\u201d", "Author": "Alexander028", "ReviewID": "UR116337153", "Content": "Second visit.

One before our cruise and one at the end of our cruise. We took at taxi from the airport to the hotel and it cost approximately 40 euros. Upon arriving at the Hotel Icaria from our long trip to Barcelona, we were given a nice room. Though not large it is modern, mostly clean, except for a small opened bottle of nail polish remover that was left on the night stand. O.k. so we threw it away and got ready to spend what the rest of the day was left visiting the Olympic Port and having dinner. The Hotel Icaria is in a somewhat desolete area of Barcelona, however a quick walk away and you will find the Olympic Port, which is located on the beach. The Olympic Port is a great place to dine and to just walk around. The walk to and from the hotel to the Olympic Port is approximately 10-15 minutes. We had a pleasant nights sleep that night, as the bed was comfortable and we were definitely exhausted from our travels. The next morning we slept through breakfast (due to jetlag and time change) so we got up in time to get ready and catch a cab to our cruise. The cab cost approximately 15 Euros to the port. It is a very convenient location if you are spending only one night before a cruise. We then did not return to the Hotel until the end of the week. We got off the ship in the morning so we did not expect a room to be ready but they graciously did give us a room. We were in room 217. This room was larger than our last and again very nice and modern and it faced the lovely pool. We dropped our stuff off in our room and went out to enjoy the beautiful city of Barcelona. We opted to purchase tickets on the Bus Turistic and the bus stop is a block and a half away, so it too is very convenient. We spent the whole day seeing the beautiful sights that Barcelona has to offer. Upon returning to our room, we prepared for our early flight out the next day and went out to dinner. We came back early because we had to be up at 5am to catch our flight. Upon arrival back to our room, 7:30 p.m we heard a lot of noise at the pool. We hoped that by 8pm the noise would stop but it did not. We had to get some rest for our long flight home, so we chose to put on our t.v. to drown out the noise. It helped and within an hours time we were asleep. No sooner did we fall asleep that I heard someone trying to open our door. I woke my husband who jumped out of bed at the same time that a man walked in our room. He had a key and was very apologetic. He immediately left the room. I was so upset, and called the front desk to advise. They were extremely apologetic and shut off all keys to our room and brought us new ones. At that time the noise at the pool was still going on and it was now 9:30 p.m., our time to sleep was becoming less, so I inquired as to when the pool area would close and I was told that it would close by 10p.m. Once again, we put on our t.v. and tried to sleep some more. The noise did not end until very, very late and needless to say if having someone walk in your room does not make for a peaceful night, I do not know what does. In the end we got a little bit of sleep and the next morning we spoke to a lady at the front desk who was so apologetic over what happend that night. We asked for the managers name and she gave it to us. We have since contacted management and they have been nothing but accomodating and understanding. In the end, I just think that it was bad luck for us that night. I honestly believe that the Hotel Icaria is a nice hotel, nice rooms and a very nice staff.

Just a short v. pleasant walk to the beach boardwalk where there are plenty of open air restaurants at the Olympic area and a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Las Ramblas. We toured the city in the daytime and were relieved to get back the the beach area and hotel in the evenings. We walked to the zoo from the hotel with a 6 yr old and it was no problem. The metro is a bit further walk in my humble opinion than some of the other reviewers had mentioned...but perhaps that is because we have a little one. Thank god we packed her scooter in a duffle bag-- we highly recommend this for families with children. We took it everywhere--the boardwalk, zoo, parks, even on the open air buses and I highly recommend this since there is usually alot of walking involved. The open air tour bus is just around the corner from the hotel and this is a good way to tour with children. The pool is small but at least there is one and it was a great way to wind down after a long day. Also, the sun beats down on the pool area pretty much all afternoon so many people were sunbathing. I tried out the \"gym\" once and never set foot in it again as it was much much nicer to run on the boardwalk every morning. There are only 2 treadmills and some weights I think, no cross trainers or any other equipment really. The buffet was much more than we had expected. There was a wide variety of fruit fresh sweet fruit, cold meats, hot meals, breads and muffins...pretty much anything you would want and we really filled up for our day. We left our windows cracked open at night as it felt a bit stuffy and ended up with v big mosquito bites. OUr daughter had huge welts on her face for weeks. The bathroom was spacious enough, we had no view to mention(just faced buildings) but we were on a lower floor, and the lighting system was a bit of a pain. Our daughter was asleep on one side of the room and we were unable to get just our bedside lights to stay on without lighting up the entire set of room lights---a real shame. V complicated and not efficient. Staff seemed ok but we did not deal with them very much. The computers are in the lobby but very much exposed so no privacy when writing emails. However, there is internet in every room w/out charge which is more than I can say for many hotels. It did take reception awhile to bring up extra toilet paper and blankets, but this didn't bother us much. Shower/bath could use updating but it was v clean and v good value for the we paid, esp. since it included the great buffet breakfast. We are very happy we did not stay near Las Ramblas as it was fun to visit but so much more relaxing at Icaria. BTW, best zoo we've ever been to(even better than san diego zoo, albeit smaller)--animals very alert and active, and grounds very lush and pretty.We truly enjoyed our stay.

The beach was 5 minutes walk away (up a slight hill) and there was a 'Tabac' shop just up the road that sold water papers etc. The main disadvantage was the breakfast and the kitchen staff.

We discovered caipirinhas here and have never looked back. We spent most of our days sight-seeing in the morning then came back in the afternoon to relax by the pool. Unfortunately, there was some building work going on at the nextdoor building, which overlooked the pool area.

Across the road and a little way down the street there is an indoor mall. Inside various eateries, including a chinese buffet, Burger King, Mexican and others. The Mexican was good. Really nice pool area, small but adequate and enough shade if needed. Great spot 5 mins walk from the beach and promenade. We had a really happy stay and would return anytime. One downside, one of the rooms had a problem with the aircon and as it was August it was rather hot, we didn't complain as we thought it wouldn't be resolved before we left and the other two rooms were fine. Being too hot after always being cold in the UK is really a joy wouldn't you agree?? Buses stop regularly almost outside the hotel and 5 mins you are in the centre of Barcelona very cheap and easy, they even have a ramp that lowers to the pavement and was brilliant to be able to get my Mum on the bus without a problem. 10 mins by taxi to cruise port cost 25 euro as we hit traffic, thousands of others heading to port at Lunchtime.

The room was a reasonable size with comfortable bed and nice furniture. The bathroom was a good size. There was a flat screen TV and wi fi access in the room. The safe was easy to operate and was big enough to take our laptop. There was a large buffet breakfast, ( which was included in our package price ) although it wasn't the highest quality. The coffee and juice weren't great but it was still extremely good value. The pool wasn't available ( it was nearly November ) but the outside area was pleasantly furnished with tables and chairs and would have been nice for my smoker husband if we had found it before we were getting ready to leave. We would be happy to go back for a couple of days but the location might be a bit boring for a longer stay. BUT BEWARE - BE VERY CAREFUL IN ANY LOCATION AS ROBBERIES ARE ENDEMIC! We were walking around near the seafront close to the Olympic Port and a young man broke away from his friends and tried to speak to us. When we didn't respond he started trying to make conversation about English football teams while trying to trip up my husband by doing some false football tackles. I would imagine if my husband had fallen over he would have helped him up and helped himself to his wallet.

It's out of the way enough to be a quiet, peaceful and relaxing place, while also being very accessible to the city centre by public transport, or even by foot. As an avid walker, I'd easily walk into the city centre from the hotel most days, but it would probably take about 20 minutes I guess. There is a Metro stop just a few blocks from the hotel, however, and I believe there is a bus-stop even closer, though I never took the bus. I must say that the public transport, particularly the Metro, is superb in Barcelona and gets you to pretty much anywhere within a few minutes. The hotel is also quite close to a number of beaches, and the Port Olympic village. We didn't have breakfast or eat in the restaurant so can't comment on that, but we did order in room-service a couple of times and it was grand. Arrived pretty late at night to the hotel but check-in was very quick and room was ready, as booked. The room was kept very clean throughout the duration of our stay.

From the airport (besides a taxi of course) you can take the \"Aerobus\" to the Placa Catalunya (4 EUR per person) and from there bus 41 across the street (or 14 that stops in famous La Rambla some 100 m further), but the Renfe train line from the airport to Estacio de Franca would be the best solution as you can use a single ticket for the ride (unfortunately, at the time of our visit this line was not accesible). Check the Bus turistic lines as they seem a good option (not personally tested), one of the lines stops near hotel - othervise take advantage of the cheap T-10 bus/metro/Renfe/tram ticket.

I realized this was more to do with the fact that we didn't have to encounter the staff who seemed to want to help but a bit confused when a problem was raised by another guest. We had one minor problem, I say minor because we left the next day but our bathroom ceiling all of a sudden started dripping water quite fast, I called the reception who assured me they were sending someone but never did, we mopped up the water with towels. The leak stopped, I assume because the person above finished their shower and we left the next day. The lifts are a bit of an experience. You have to put your room card in the slot to go up - not down, but they fail to tell you this. My cards kept getting demagnetised for some reason over the course of our stay and I repeatedly traveled up and down in the lifts until fellow guests saved me. Amusing at first but very tedious after my tenth trip... Some other guests had problems with their room bookings in not receiving what they had requested, they seemed to have alot of hassle trying to find the right person to sort it out and were waiting in the pool area for a good few hours. The room was quite small I found for a 4 star, but it was clean and the bathroom with it's green marble is pleasant. There's no balcony however, a problem if you smoke and want a glass of wine in your room, but the lounge area to the left of the pool is lovely. Simple, but very comfortable, with deep, wooden sofas and if you're there early, you can loiter there the whole day ordering light snacks and drinks. I loved breakfast and am not sure why previous guests have been disappointed. There's a huge spread, something for everyone I thought and they even provided Soya milk much to the delight of my friend! The hotel is a short trot from the beach. It's in a quiet location and is easily accessible by bus. We tried to take a bus from the airport when we arrived but there was major confusion when we got to Catalunya bus depot. The tourist information queue snakes round and you'll be in it for half an hour at least. Many places were closed for 'the holidays' , which annoyed me as it's a holiday destination. By all means take your vacation, but staff your shops in the meantime! La Ramblas is a very busy street with stalls and entertainers as you see in Covent Garden. Watch your bag/wallet, there's alot of silver/ethnic/gothic/I made it myself jewelry and fridge magnets on sale on nearly every stall which is great, if you like that sort of thing - I don't. If you want nightlife, then this is not necessarily a good place to stay. The buses stop running after 10.30pm I think and the local bars/clubs are uneventful. It's also quite lonely walking back from the beach bars area to the hotel so take care... Go and see the Gaudi architecture, but go early otherwise you'll be standing in Madame Tussuad's queues, uncomfortable in the August heat!

The location was fine, the beach and port (with all it's bars and restaurants) just a 5 minute walk away, but other than that the hotel was really isolated - but at least it was quiet at night. Check in was short and sweet, but they forget to tell everyone that you need to use your hotel key card in the lift or you won't be going anywhere..... luckily some other guests helped us out. The room was ok, but the bathroom door didn't shut, it took a few hours and phone calls to resolve but as the hotel was full and we couldn't change rooms, they did send someone to fix it pretty quickly. We had to go down and spend a couple of hours by the crowded pool area while we waited (it's VERY small, even smaller than the pictures on the websites so don't expect to get a sun lounger). Otherwise the room was ok & fittings new, just don't look too closely and so you don't notice the bathroom ceiling had a damp patch and the bedside cabinet tops weren't properly clean.... they do provide tea and coffee, but no milk and the plastic tea spoons disappeared after day 1.... be prepared to bring your own!! On the 3rd day there was a problem with a burst pipe so we had no water for a day - we called to complain and reception explained no one had water (hadn't had it all day, not that they bothered to tell anyone) and then brought us one 1litre bottle of mineral water to wash with (between the two of us). When the water came back on it was slightly yellow, so we decided not to use it. Breakfast was very mediocre (hot food limited and cold) - ok I think pretty atrocious for a 4 star hotel (coffee tasted like watery instant, and only herbal tea as an alternative) - & the rest was disappointing, suggest you head to the local shops or the port for a much better option (and cheaper!) So, to the main complaint, after day 1 we decided to cancel breakfast which we had pre-booked for one of us - and were told by an incredibly rude man at reception (he kept answering the phone without a single apology while talking to us), who told us we couldn't, it was included in the price (no it wasn't) and only when we got annoyed would he check our reservation and realise that we had ordered the breakfast separately and yes it could be cancelled. Reception in general were rude and unhelpful, not interested in helping or providing good service. We asked about the theatre tickets (as per the leaflet in reception) and they told us to go to the theatre ourselves and buy tickets..... the one notable exception was the very nice lady who helped us check out very quickly and ordered a taxi as our flight had changed, she was quick and efficient. The hotel is just about ok, although I think VERY expensive for what you get, I think you are better off paying a bit more for the hotels nearer the port/town - they are also that bit nearer to things as it's about 30 min walk to the old town from the hotel icaria -or picking something more reasonably priced nearer town - the public transport system is fantastic & cheap (don't go on the tourist bus, get on the metro/use taxis - it actually worked out much cheaper and far more flexible) Barcelona however is fantastic, worth the trip, but probably you should pick another hotel.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cGood Location\u201d", "Author": "uktravelller", "ReviewID": "UR20037310", "Content": "The staff on reception were helpful and polite, room was modern and clean, our room had a view of the pool and terrace, and a view of the city.

Unfortunately, it was raining, so we were not able to open the window for fresh air either. We asked the hotel to hold our luggage after we checked out. They have a locked room, but because they were busy, we were told to set it aside in the lobby and they would get to it when they had a chance. When we returned several hours later, I was disappointed to see it still sitting in the lobby were we left it.

On that note, definitly watch out for the cab drivers. We were told by the hotel that the ride would be 20-25 euro, the cab meter said 18 when we arrived at the terminal, then he did some magic and suddenly it was 30 euro.

The rooms were excellently presented and my partner was very impressed with the overall quality of the hotel. Hotel Icaria is five minutes walk from a \"crossover point\" for the \"Barcelona Bus Turistic\" (the red / blue / yellow open topped hop-on / hop-off sight seeing buses), basically you walk out of the reception and go left (towards the car wash at the end of the road) and then turn right (the stop is across the road).

I would recommend this hotel unreservedly, it is great value for money, it's close to the beach and marina, has good public transport links and the rooms are excellent.

I was wrong. Instead, I was given a one room with a king size bed and a small twin and the bath. I went to the front desk and they pulled my order. I told them what I thought I had ordered and they said, \"You have 2 adults and a child.\" I explained that the child was 17. They immediately checked and upgraded me, at no cost, to a business suite that had a room with a king bed and an \"office\" equipped with computer, desk, recliner chair, and coffee table, with plenty of room for a single bed. It was perfect. The bathroom was awesome. We were staying there for 3 days and traveling elsewhere for 2 weeks and returning at the end of our trip. The front desk reserved that same room for us on our return trip at no additional cost. The all-you-can-eat breakfast was great with all varieties of breakfasts from around the world. It was definitely enough to hold us over until Tapas time, with a gelato and espresso lunch in between. The staff was wonderful and accommodating. I give it 5 stars and will tell everyone to go there. By the way, the taxi from the airport was only 18 Euros, plus 1 Euro for each piece of luggage. I am not sure what the other person is talking about when they paid 38 Euros.

Location: We took the train from the airport and changed to the L4 on the metro at Passeig de Gracia. You can use T10 tickets for the train as well as the metro. The walk from the metro station to the hotel is at least 10 minutes. But since one of us almost had his wallet pickpocketed, that was the last time we took the metro during this trip. Going back to the airport at the end of our trip we took a taxi and it only cost EUR23. The hotel is set in a quiet area with a bus stop right in front of it and the tourist bus is only around the corner. You can get to La Rambla on the 14 bus in about 10-15 minutes but a taxi ride will only cost EUR6 anyway. A 5 minutes walk will take you to the beach and a further 2 minutes you're at the marina. There's a good supermarket in the shopping center only 2 minutes away where there are also lots of restaurants. Hotel / reception: It has a nice lobby, well furnished with tropical fish tanks. As soon as you enter the hotel you can already see the terrace and the pool in the back. Apparently some non-guests also wander in to use the pool... People at reception are helpful. They sit quietly behind the desk but as soon as you walk up to them they will smile and do what they can for you. Check in was quick but one of our rooms wasn't ready until about 2 hours after we checked in. Room: Sufficient space, well furnished and clean. The bed was very comfortable. I've been having back pains for a few weeks before the trip and during the 3 nights there I always woke up the next morning pain free! (Once I got home to UK the pain returned... :P) The safe and fridge both came in very useful. We had a pool view room on the 4th floor and we could see the AGBAR tower clearly. No noise from the construction site next door while we were there. Maybe they have August off... Breakfast: A good selection of hot and cold items. Breakfast is served from 7 - 11 so it never got too crowded. Recommendation: There a \"seafood stall\" restaurant called La Paradeta near to the Zoo/Park on C/Commercial 7. You can get there on the 14 bus and it's also a stop on the tourist bus. You pick the seafood you want from the \"stall\", get it weighed, tell them how you want it cooked and they cook it for you. Really fresh and tasty and very reasonably priced. For the amount we ate it would have cost us at least double back in UK. It is down an alley way next to the old market, so mainly locals eat here. They open at 8, we finished our meal at 10:30 and there was still a long queue at that time, so get there early! Best meal we had in Barcelona. We did all the sights and ate too much food so I don't think we'll be going back to Barcelona anytime soon.

We wanted a base in Barcelona that was outside the noise and bustle of the city centre and also offered easy access to the beach. The Icaria's location fitted the bill perfectly, being on the edge of town in the modern Port olmpic area just a few minutes walk from both the beach and marina. Most of the revews posted for the hotel were very positive and the pictures that were available showed good quality accommodation and facilities so we felt we were on to a winner. We weren't disappointed. I would offer the following comments for anyone thinking of going:- a). Location - we loved the fact that if offered the best of both worlds in our opinion, being close to the (great) beaches and also the town centre. There are metro and bus stops close by (bus stop just outside the hotel but metro a bit of a walk) but also numerous taxis passing the hotel. Taxis were good value with prices varying between 5 - 8 euros for the trip into town depending where you want to go. The neighbourhood also seemed very safe and clean and we had no problems walking back late at night from the metro station. Within a few minutes walk there is a small shopping centre and sundry other shops and restaurants. There are also numerous bars and restaurants down on thebeach and around the marina. We felt that the beach bars were fair value but were disappointed with the one meal we had in a restaurant down at the marina. b). Facilities and accommodation - we found all of the staff, but particularly the reception staff, to be very friendly and able to speak very good english. The bedrooms were great, spotlessly clean, a good size and with high quality fittings and fixtures. Must mention the lovely marble bathrooms! There are also free safes in each room which proved useful. TV wise there are nice flat screen tvs but limited english channels, but hey you're on holiday so you shouldn't be watching it anyway! Outside there is a relatively small pool and plenty of seating including comfortable soft seating areas. For those who want it there is also a small fitness suite. c). Food and drink - we thought the breakfast was great with a good choice to suit most peoples needs. Could get a bit busy at times but I suspect that we were generally in there at peak periods. There's a fair range of options for lunch, dinnner, snacks etc too and we felt the quality was very good. Prices seemed pretty fair, particularly when compared to the marina, but one thing I would say is that on both ocassions when we had dinner there we had starters and main courses coming out at different times for different people. This may be a Spanish thing as we also had this problem at restaurants in town, or maybe we're just unlucky! Another slight negative was the price of drinks. Personally we felt these were a bit high for beer and soft drinks. We were paying 4 euros for a glass that held about a third of a pint, which was much more than either the beach bars or other restaurants we went to in town. Yes I know it's a 4 star hotel, but.... d). Other matters - you can't miss it, there are buildings going up around the pool area. We weren't disturbed by the noise particularly as we had rooms on the other side but you have to wonder what impact they will ultimately have on the pool area. Obviously not the hotels fault but let's hope they don't build them too high and cut off the sun. So, that's it. Yes there are a few down sides but overall we loved the hotel, it's location and the friendly staff. Bearing in mind the price we paid we feel it fully deserves 5/5. A final quick word about Barcelona itself. It's brilliant. We hope to go back there and finish off the things we never managed to do this time.

After very harsh words with the reception manager we were introduced to the hotel manager; an excellent man if ever there was one. He relocated all of our soon to be arrived guests at the front of the hotel, thus away from the noise. He visted the building site and warned the site officer that work wasn't able to start until 8am. He then made our stay as comfortable as he could with free cava in each of the 90 guests rooms, free breakfast the next day and a complementary stay for my events team to come back and sample the hotel, post building work. In summary, we experienced the Icaria probably at its worst. The building work is set to get less obvious and noisy. The conference was saved by the customer service of the manager and his team.

The hotel itself is very nice, the bedrooms are modern and have a mini fridge, safe and flat screen TV. There is also free Internet access in the room. There are only 2 English channels so your TV viewing is quite limited. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis and there were a very good variety of foods available.

Booked this hotel through researching online comments such as those on this page and I wasn't disappointed. First lets look at the bigger picture - Barcelona is a very big city which seems to be very geared towards tourism. The 'hub' of the city around the Ramblas is very busy (and much more expensive than elsewhere) and for anyone visiting they are going to explore the city using the tourist bus. Visitors want safe, clean and well located accommodation. Lets look at the positives: 1. Icaria is on the edge of town, placed in the excellent (and seemimgly very safe) Port Olimpic area. Beautiful beaches and hundreds of bars and restaurants are a 5 minute walk from the hotel. 2. There are 2 ATM's literally 200m down the street from the hotel. 3. There is a small shopping mall opposite these machines. 4. The tourist bus stops 200m down the other end of the street (10min ride from Las Ramblas). This means that travel to any tourist destination within the city basically leaves from your doorstep and drops you off there as well. Its away from the bedlam of the city centre yet within reach of it very easily. 5. The hotel is clean, well maintained and staff dealt with any requests in a quick, professional manner. 6. The restaurant food was very nice. 7. Safe in room very secure and used friendly. Now for the negatives: 1.The hotel seemed to have the feel of a 'business type' establishment, but there were other families staying there as well and we did not feel out of place. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and Icaria is as good as any. 2. The staff, while not overly friendly, are good at their job, which is the most important thing. 3. The pool seemed OK (it was too cold to use it) and the gym is basic (x2 treadmills, x2 cycles and a few free weights). 4. The lighting system in the room is wacky - 9 bedside switches and each one does something different each time its pressed 5. Mini-bar products massively overpriced (use the supermarket in shopping mall instead !!) 6. Only x2 English speaking TV channels (CNN World and Nat. Goeg.) 7. Shop around for best price - I rang the hotel directly twice - the first time they quoted me 200E per night then 1 hr later told me they had no availability. I then booked online and got a much better rate than this. So there you have it. In my opinion Icaria is as good an hotel as you will get in Barcelona for the above reasons.

Breakfast were included because of \"early booking\" but the \"breakfast-staff\" still tried to get us to sign off for it. When we asked why, they maintained it was not included. Sorted out quickly when we spoke to staff in the reception, but still a bit of an annoyance. The sorting out were probably helped by the fact that we had very good documentation that it were to be included.. Staff attitude and response to legitimate complaints. The bad: Broken A/C (set in \"winter position\" apparently), which were not fixed the whole stay (5 nights). Instead, it was set on approx 28 degrees, making the room hot!. With no A/C, the window had to be open, and the traffic noise then became an issue. Safe locked when we arrived, and it took way longer to get someone to unlock it than it should have (2 hours and three reminders and finally going down to the reception to get the staff myself) Swimming pool placed so you had to pass through the lobby to and from, no privacy to speak of, and a laughably equipped gym.

For peace and quiet you are better off getting a place in the Rambla, this would also be vastly more central.", "Date": "April 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "N Ireland", "Title": "\u201cModern and spotlessly clean\u201d", "Author": "Bee40", "ReviewID": "UR7219244", "Content": "Hi, we booked this hotel thru Alpha Rooms having read some good reviews there, we wern't disappointed. The hotel is modern and staffed by very young people from reception to the catering and even the cleaning...that said, the reception staff are a little aloof...extremely helpful ....but still aloof. We had room 113 which overlooked the pool but was right next to where building work was taking place so was noisy from early am ...however as we wern't gonna be in the room all day we didnt bother changing. The room is spacious, had a fridge, a flat screen tv (only 2 English channels )heating/airconditioning unit which you could adjust yourself, a safe, a couple of comfy seats in addition to the roomy twin beds and a spotlessly clean fully tiled bathroom with a hairdryer in it. The pool/jacuzzi area is gorg with the pool up on a decked area and the terrace had big comfy leather sofas and squashy cushions, (a business meeting took place on the saturday and the pool was off limits )...very hip and trendy but this is overlooked by the building work. The dining room is large and the breakfast was scrumptious, cereal, fruit and yogurt, cheeses and cold meats, bread rolls and bread for toasting,and boiled/scrambled or fried eggs with bacon and baked beans. Also tea/coffee/orange juice and a selection of pastries. Plentiful and hot and just yummy and served from 7 am until 11 am...excellent service. Walk out the front door and turn left, 50 yards down the street cross over the road and then go left across the next road and you are facing the beaches which are just lovely. Before you go to the beach is the touristic bus stop...great value at 24 euro for 2 days and you get on and off them all day long from 9 am until 7 or 8 pm. You could walk into the city in 20 mins briskly but buses and taxis are cheap enough. I would return to this hotel and this area....enjoy.", "Date": "March 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "Klo2", "ReviewID": "UR7191217", "Content": "Choosing a hotel for a week in Barcelona was important given that it was going to be my \u2018home\u2019 for a 7 days and nights. Various relatives recommended staying near Las Ramblas, as you would be in the heart of the City. However I spent a fair while searching for a hotel in that area but couldn\u2019t secure a hotel for the full 7 nights within the price and star range I wanted (4* around 80-100 euros a night). Then my search stumbled across Hotel Icaria. To be honest it looked too good to be true. The pictures looked fab. and for 5 of the nights I would be paying only 85 euros for what was a 4* hotel which appeared more like a 5* (for the other 2 weekend nights I would be paying a bit more). Some photos are attached. I then looked at Trip Advisor for reviews - overall positive, but with some negative comments about the attitude of reception staff. Also there were notes that it was a bit out of the city, but not too far/costly by taxi. So I went ahead and confirmed. This review was written on my last night. It really has been a fantastic stay and I can highly recommend the hotel. I\u2019m as critical as they come so this recommendation isn\u2019t made lightly! The hotel is very plush with rooms of a high standard. The standard room didn\u2019t offer tea/coffee facilities though, which I discovered after searching every nook and cranny thinking \u201cit must be somewhere!\u201d. I didn\u2019t use the outdoor pool but it appeared very clean and the spa was on whenever I looked. I can imagine it being very nice in slightly warmer weather. I think it\u2019s real plus point is the location. It is so quiet and feels so safe. In fact, were I to live in the central Barcelona I could see myself in this residential area. The hotel is a bit out of town but not isolated with cafes and restaurants within 5-10 minutes walk. There is also a large supermarket within a few minutes (look for El Centre de la Ville). More so has been the ease of travel into the centre. The 41 bus stop is less than a minute away and takes you to Playa Cataluyna (and on route via other areas of interest). Taking the 41 bus the other way leads you to a new mall. The other main bus I used is the 36, which goes along the beach/harbour area and again the bus stop must be less that 2 minutes away. The bus is 1.25 euros but is cheaper with the travel cards. The hotel has the public transport maps available to take away and I would recommend studying them as I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of access to tourism areas. In addition, the Bus Touristoc stops less than a minute away. I did get a taxi from the bus station and it was about 8 euros. One back from La Sagrada Familia was 6 euros. Also for anyone searching the forum for the term disability/disabled I was really impressed by the bus\u2019 disabled access. It all seemed so routine and quick, with people in wheelchairs getting on and off via an electronic disabled access ramp and having a space on the bus, with such ease. Also concerning location I walked past the Las Ramblas hotels I had looked at and now can only imagine them to be cramped, noisy and without the peacefulness of this area. Saying that on the third morning I was woken by the sound of drilling. On booking I had asked for a quiet room and was appropriately given one overlooking the pool, but it turned out that a building was being constructed next door. I phoned the reception and asked for a quieter room and within 5 mins a receptionist was at my door with a key for a room on the 6th floor, albeit on the main road but an upgrade and much quieter (and with tea/coffee facilities!). On that note, the reception staff have been very helpful and knowledgeable when approached. The technological side of the hotel has been good, but not quite as exuberant as implied by advertising. In both rooms the LCD TV had excellent quality, however they only have two and sometimes three English channels (CNBC and National Geographic and sometimes CNN), but that seems above average for the area. Neither room came with a DVD but I didn\u2019t specifically ask for one (with the hotel info. stating that extras could be supplied when requested). As noted in other reviews of the hotel, the lighting system, was in principal, a bonus, but with no instructions I would find myself pressing a button on the panel by the bed, then finding that the light I wanted to turn off was still on. I would then get up and try the light switch itself, though sometimes that seemed to be overridden! Even working out how to get lights on in the first place was a bit like the Krypton Factor, until I realised you need to put your card key in a slot by the door. Very clever idea once you work it out! A real plus was the free internet access. From both of the rooms I was in I was connected within seconds. Overall, I would certainly stay here again, though do wonder about prices in high season given the beach location. If you find a deal here though that looks too good to be true I would go for it. Oh yes - Barcelona itself is a must see city!

ANGELS! REALLY LIKE the fact that the tourist bus stop is just around the corner so you can get back to the hotel after a day cruising on the various busses looking at sites. The location is nearish to the Olympic port area (walking distance of about 5mins) which is nice - just dont stop at the first restaurant you see or like us you will have a dodgy meal. There are not very many options for vegetarians in Barcelona so make sure you get a few tips and maps on where to eat if you want to get fed properly and whatever you do - DONT EAT ON LAS RAMBLAS!! eeek.. the food was sooooo soooo bad!!! scary - wish we'd been warned before so now you have.
