{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cozy This is a nice hotel. Although the location is quite difficult to find at first, but once you find it, it's so convenient. Located near the Ueno station where you can find both Bullet train (Shinkansen) station and Metro station. The room is small, but immaculately clean. The service they provide is also good.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR271770675", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "tournesol08"}, {"Content": "Good choice We stayed at this hotel twice, at the start of our trip and at the end.As Tokyo does not have a city centre this can be classified in a good location with JR and tube station within walking distance. Ueno station is around 5-10 minute walk. There are plenty of shops and resturant around with ueno park and shrine within walking distance.The hotel is a basic 3 star hotel, it's clean, rooms are not very big but comfortable and quiet.Monica, London", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR188626716", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MonicasLondon"}, {"Content": "Good value for money We chose this hotel because of its afforability in a very expensive city and the Ueno area had quite a few of the attractions we wanted to see, was within walking distance to Asakusa and is also a very short train trip to Tokyo central and Ginza. The hotel is a 7 minute walk to the main railway station and the popular Yamanote line but the better option would be to use the Ginza line and get off at Inaricho Station which then only leaves a 2 minute walk to the Hotel. We opted for a twin bedded room as it provided much more floor space than the slightly cheaper double bedded rooms. The hotel was modern, spotlessly clean and provided free internet use in the lobby but it is tucked away in a side street and a little difficult to find first up.", "Date": "Apr 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR643486837", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Anzacbiscuit08"}, {"Content": "Good location close to ueno station This hotel is nothing flash but its clean, comfortable and close to Ueno station .

The room was very clean, the beds were both king singles, the bathroom was clean and everything worked without problems. The room was smaller than the other hotels that we had stayed in, but it was enough room for 2 ppl. There was a fridge we could fill with our own food (this is preferable over having a stocked minibar, IMO). The room rates were very reasonable, and the hotel was in an interesting location in Ueno, it may be a bit hard to find at first, but once there it is close to Ueno JR and Keisei Station, and walkng distance to Kappabashi Dori, and Asakusa. The staff were all very friendly and spoke some English. There were 2 computers for guests free of chrage. The room had windows that could be opened and the heating could be controlled or turned off, this is a must as sometimes the room could become deathly hot even with the heating on low. This is a very decent hotel, close to Ueno, with convience stores and many places to eat close by. Definitely worth staying in!", "Date": "Apr 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR214571538", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "b00kbunny"}, {"Content": "\u95ae\u3125\u773f\u9287\u5c83\u569f\u9287\u52f6\u7d12   showReview(23234390, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR167908822", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "\u9289\ue0fe\u505d\u9289?> \u9289\ue0fe\u505d\u9289?</a> </div>"}, {"Content": "\u6910\u546b\u4eb1\u9288\u590e\u7e4e\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(20753330, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR401519574", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066461-d620111-r20171016-Chisun_Hotel_Ueno-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "620111", "Price": "$126"}}
