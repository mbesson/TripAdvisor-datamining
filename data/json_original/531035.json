We had to scream for help and a few minutes later two very nice people pryed the door open and pulled us out! It was a hilarious but terrifying way to start our trip! Great location in the center of Rome. Conciege was very nice and helpful. The room was clean and a good size. Nice breakfast lots of bread. Would stay here again!

I have stayed in some crappy hotels/motels/hostels so far, but this was by far my worst experience. I don't consider myself too picky about cleanliness or service. However, I have never had such a bad experience that I felt compelled to write a review on tripadvisor.com to try to save other travelers like me from booking this hotel. First, the bathrooms were so disgusting my friend and I chose not shower during our stay - which is saying a lot. There was mildew everywhere. The smell was so awful it wafted throughout the whole room. The toilet would not flush, no matter how long you stood there with your finger on the button, which only added to the smell after 2 nights, as you can imagine. I couldn't even comfortably use the sink to wash my face. It was so mildewy I physically gagged when I tried, which was just as well considering there was almost zero water pressure so almost no water came out. The beds were incredibly small and uncomfortable. I had to use my blanket for a pillow since the pillow we were given was so thin it hurt my neck to sleep on. That made for a cold night. The staff was incredibly unfriendly, unhelpful and rude. At 7am my friend and I were woken up by the group of students that had booked the remainder of our floor. They were screaming, shouting, running between rooms and blasting music from then until 9am! We politely asked the front desk to ask them to be quieter, at least to turn off the music, and they replied, \"They're a group of students,\" shrugged and laughed. Duh. Thanks for nothing. It's ironic, since I know they have experience \"shush-ing\" people because they \"shush-ed\" me when I was in the lobby skyping with my mother in the U.S. to tell her that I made it to Rome OK, since the WIFI would not work in the rooms as promised (They said it would be working \"tomorrow.\" Shocking - it never got fixed). I guess I was disturbing the staff member, who was the only person in the entire lobby, as he watched a movie at the check-in desk. So, my friend and I had our breakfast of a rock hard biscuit and water, since the juice machine did not work, until it was taken away at 9:20am. The location might draw your attention to this hotel, but trust me, not worth it! It only takes up one floor in a whole building complex of hotels. Perhaps try another hotel in the same building? There's plenty around.

The first time the reception guy put me through. Then the phone cut, so I called again 2 hours later at 8 pm Canadian time, and the receptionist told me the phone system is not working and I must call back tommorow! I was really surprised but before I hung up he told me \"wait, I will try to connect you\" so he put me on hold for 20 minutes before hanging up on me!!! Then I keep calling and he picks up and puts me on hold for 10 minutes (this happened 3 times) without even saying hi or anything and hangs up on me. I know he does this because I hear him picking up and then pressing the hold button and then I listend to the tacky hold recording play for about 10 minutes each time and then hear him hang up. My husband is Canadian but has gotten a very dark tan from his just previous trip on business to France, and has told me that since they first saw him at the hostel he has gotten horribly mean looks and equally rude service which, to me is intolerable because I am from the multicultural city of Montreal and the description of how he has been treated in italy would never be tolerated in Montreal. I guess we cant expect everyone everywhere to be as embracing of different cultures as us however, a certain level of respect towards another human being should always be expected whenever you are giving money in exchange for a service in a place of business. If they arent willing to treat you with respect (or at least even just to your face!! they arent forced to genuinely like you for goodness sake!!!) they shoudlnt take your money. My husband was also in the midst of describing the incidents of crude rudeness he was served with at the hotel when the phone hung up, but believe me, from what ive heard, if you want a smile and humane service, with the opportunity of using the room telephone, either make sure you are white or go to another hotel. ( I have nothing against caucasians or any ethnicity for that matter, I am half Canadian and half Asian, my husband is Canadian as well) Not only did they refuse to allow my husband to use the phone, one of them even told him breakfast was included and insisted that it was before my husband booked. The other receptionist who took over the night shift denied any breakfast was included and stated clearly \"I said no breakfast and it doesnt matter what the othe man said because I am in charge now\" When my husband wanted to leave within an hour of haaving paid, becaus of the rude service and bad communication between staff who misinformed him, they refused to give me even a partial refund. He is staying there for 1 night but is certainly changing hotel tommorow, hofefully to somewhere where communication with one\"s family by the use of a phone is permitted and where the staff is not so dissatisfied with life in general to be so rude and angry to customers.", "Date": "May 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro", "Title": "\u201cNice stay !\u201d", "Author": "rnovato", "ReviewID": "UR25830460", "Content": "As I didn't have much time for looking for many hotels on the internet, and I wanted a cheap place to stay, I could say that Hotel Ferrarese was what I expected. Upon arriving there, I had to undestand how everything works, because on the same building there are many different hotels and hostels to stay. The reception was on the first floor, and my room on the fourth. Old building, no facilities in it. At the first moment I got in the reception, I was told that my room was not available and that I had to wait for about an hour, to get the keys. That didn't bother me so much, I left my luggage there, and walked around the block. The room was really small, there were two beds, a tv, a wardrobe, and a strange bathroom. As I stayed there for only 3 days, and walked around the city all day long, this hotel was not a problem at all. But for people going with family, and children, I would definetely say it is not a good place to stay and wouldn't recommend it. Well, the bathroom was too small, a bit smelly, and had no separation for the shower, so, after bathing yourself it gets all wet. One good thing about Hotel Ferrares is the location, it is close to everything, right beside Termini Station, just two blocks away. And there are many facilities in the neighborhood such as internet, phones, restaurants and bars. The supermarket is about 10 minutes walking. Rome is amazing, food is delicious, and that's why hotel ferrarese didn't bother me. If you intend to stay in Rome for more days, try to look for another one, you will definetely find somewhere else that is also clean but better that this one.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGood Rates, Great location, but..\u201d", "Author": "travelshow", "ReviewID": "UR10476713", "Content": "The Good: Location, less than a mile from Termini Train station, we walked with bags in 10 minutes. 4 Nice Resterants within 1 block, Laundry 2 doors down, Internet cafe across the street, corner market 4 doors down, 3 nice Plazza's within a mile, Bus , Metro, & Taxi stand within a mile. The rate for a double was 110.euros a night. The Rooms were quite large by european standards. The Bad: They charge 6.00 euro for a bad breakfast. Most of the Staff don't speak english. The Elevator dosen't reach the ground floor, so you must drag your bags up a winding flight of stairs to access it. There is a lot of noise from the street, but thats the norm in the center of Rome. The Ugly: Maid service was poor, no soap, not enough towels (those that were provided were poor quality), the floors were not swept.

The rooms are on the fourth floor, which is 108 (five-inch) steps above street level. The elevator will take you there. We were in a quad-person room, overlooking Principe Amedeo street. It was very noisy with the windows open, and mildly noisy with the windows closed. There was a small bathroom, with one towel rack. The shower consisted of shower pipes in the corner of the bathroom, with a curtain composing the other two walls of the shower. There was no soap dish in the shower. The towels were unique, like linen, rather than terrycloth. There was one five-by-five inch washcloth for the four of us. The soap was typical cheap-hotel-soap which barely lathered and seemd to leave a film on your face. The bed was hard. I didn't sleep well. The pillow was hard, and flat, even after I bent it double. The staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was not included, but was five Euros if you wanted to pay for it. We got bread from a local bakery and croissants from the Bontempi Bar on Farini Street for breakfast. There is a fruit stand two blocks away by the train station where you can buy fruit. There are numerous pizzerias, ristorantes and trattorias in the area. There is a McDonalds and a PastOrita by the train station. It was amusing to this American to find the Italian Chinatown two blocks away. I can barely read Italian, much less Chinese Italian. It wasn't the greatest place, but it was tolerable, if you don't mind a bit of street noise at night. It was actually entertaining to hang out the window and watch the action down below. It isn't the type of place you stay for the hotel experience. It is the type of place you come back to at night for some sleep before hitting more sights early the next day. I would stay there again. I'm not very picky. My wife gave it two stars out of five stars. My adult children gave it three stars out of five stars. For you Internet addicts, there is a high-speed Internet point two doors down which charges one Euro for 30 minutes. It really was a fast connection. The hotel itself has an Internet point for one Euro per hour, but it looks a bit old. I didn't try it. The location of the hotel by the train station is good. The bus station is there.
