But I understand that this is the vibe that W Hotels are going after and I love that they've picked their niche and are going for it. My wife and I have stayed at the W Seattle 3 times through the years and enjoyed our stay every time. I don't think I'd recommend this hotel as a \"family hotel\" but I don't think that is what they're going for anyway. If they're trying to capture the 28-50 year old, that wears the latest trendy eye wear and whose wardrobe is at least 50% black clothing, they've nailed it. The lobby area has a very cool vibe with a large sitting area and books to relax after all the walking one invariably does in Seattle. The rooms are very cozy and most offer a pretty good view. All the design throughout the property has a very clean and contempory look. The location of this property is ideal and pricing for the rooms is quite reasonable for the location within a major city. I would totally stay here again but just need to do a quick run to Nordstrom first so I feel like I fit in.

I should mention that I am in the tourism business - i.e critical. From the door person, to the desk staff, to the bell person, the hostess in the restaurant and the wait staff . . . I kept waiting for a slip up, but no - they were all, each one attentive, warm and caring. As for my room, the decor was relaxing, upbeat and very contemporary. A bit European in flavor. Loved it. Perfect. All the latest amenities; a great big HD TV and an IPad dock - plus a number of other items looking hi tech that I did not get to. The view you ask? I took a few photos with my phone (see attached). The Seattle Needle, the water front with boats going by, grand old buildings from past decades - just lovely. It was sprinkling that day. We were going to walk to the Seattle Art Museum (Gaugin) and the desk person asked: Oh would you like the Acura car to drive you over? No charge and no problem. YES! And a delightful fellow drove us over there dropping us right at the front door. Paul. Tip: Breakfast-there is a darling french-type cafe across the street with FRESH almond croissants and lattes. And there are plenty of restaurants easily in walking distance if you are staying several days and wish to have variety. I almost forgot, one can not use the elevators without a room key. Just an extra touch of security.

Very friendly staff, mostly helpful but not so much when I asked them why the bar was closed at 10pm. They had a makeshift bar and restaurant in the hotel. They made a great fuss about handing out this schedule on check in. In my room they had left a message for me to contact the front desk to ensure that I had received the schedule. But it was worthless. The bar closing time was midnight on the schedule but in reality, they were closing it whenever they wanted. What's was the point of the schedule? Anyway....the room was good, nice smellies in the bathroom. Terrible view but it was away from the street and so relatively quiet. Nothing else to report really as I didn't really use any of the services. At the conference rate, the hotel would have been a good deal had all the facilities been in place.

We had never stayed in a W, and we both loved it! We thought the price was very fair for a great city location within walking distance of many restaurants and two Starbucks. My daughter and I loved the cool, hip atmosphere and special touches such as flavored water & morning coffee in the lobby. I'm not sure why others have complained about the rooms. Our room with double beds was very clean, spacious, and stocked with spa-like robes and Bliss bath products/shampoos. Everything looked pretty new, with upscale trendy decor. The Westin Heavenly Beds were plush and very comfortable. Parking is expensive in a nearby garage, but that's typical for all downtown hotels. Once we parked, we never needed to drive our car since we were able to walk whereever we wanted to go. It's located in the bus \"free zone\" so you can hop on a free bus and get closer to many popular destinations such as Westlake & Pacific Place shopping centers. Walking to Pike Place Market is possible (about 6 city blocks away), or shorten your walk by riding the free bus for a couple blocks and get off near Pike Street. (Unless you know what you're doing, be careful not to take one of the long \"express\" buses, since they don't make as many stops). I highly recommend the Purple Cafe & Wine Bar which is only a block away. The food was great and the ample selection of wine flights which is a fun way to try several good wines. The W is definitely not for everyone, especially not for young children, not for elderly, and not for anyone wanting lots of amenities and pampering.

I have to admit it was not a good stay. To begin with, I entered the address in my GPS. When it said I had arrived at my destination, I couldn't find it. The hotel lobby is undergoing renovation and there's no markings to say the entrance was around the corner on Senecca and the only sign I finally found (after driving around the block again) was the unlit W plaque. As others have mentioned, the lobby is undergoing renovation and it should be completed within a few more weeks. Hopefully that will improve the visibility issue. My room was nice. An upper floor corner room with floor-to-ceiling windows. A nice view of the library and the city. The room was comfortable but there was a big white spot on the night stand next to the bed that could have easily been buffed out (it was just wax from someone setting something wet on it). In addition, the wi-fi didn't work in the room. I called the front desk and they connected me with their off-site IT department. They were able to fix the problem for a little while but I ended up making another call the next day again for the same problem. Be sure to check you bill before checking out. Remember having to contact the IT department a second time? When the front desk connected me with them, they charged me for the phone call! They also charged me for room service I ordered that I had paid cash for! The front desk said they would back out the charges but couldn't print a receipt for me. They e-mailed one to me but instead of backing out the charges, they billed me a second time for them! Thank goodness for American Express. I just called them and they'll deal with it. Hopefully things will improve. I talked to SPG corporate customer service this morning (I'm a SPG Platinum member) and they set up a file on it but I doubt I'll stay here again. Next time I'm back in Seattle I'll go back to the Westin, which was my first choice but was sold out for one of the nights I was in town.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cAnother Excellent Stay\u201d", "Author": "PrincessBeach", "ReviewID": "UR124976189", "Content": "My husband and I have stayed here on several occasions.

To me this W seems like a renovation of a previous, traditional hotel. We did get the fabulous corner room on a top floor, 22nd. I love the floor to ceiling windows on the corner and sat in the chaise looking out at the buildings, park and traffic for glorious hours. That's what I do when I leave my small town home. We did have a view of the beautiful city library but not the water unfortunately. We stayed five days and got to know many of the staff. They were good to great. One that stood out was Micheal who floated around the front desk. He introduced himself. Got to know us but didn't linger. He always asked if I wanted juice for our baby, water and even made sure I had a bag to carry it all in. Every time we saw him. He jumped to it. I call it the W hustle and he had it. The lobby had coffee and donuts every morning and beautiful cookies every afternoon. Maybe because of the reno's. Wifi was also free in our rooms because of it. That pleased me. I hate when they still charge you for everything even though the services are limited. It was the lobby and restaurant that were being renovated. They had a temporary restaurant which I also appreciated. My husband needed it in the morning when the baby was still getting up too early for me. The location is nice, near the water, Pike Place market and shopping. I tried a lot of the local restaurants and had some amazing food. Shuckers next door is good for a cocktail and oysters. Nice old, wood bar with atmosphere in the old Olympia hotel, now the Fairmont. Also in this hotel is the amazing Belle Epoque (I think) a french bakery. This is a must. Coffee and pastries are amazing. I also had a Croque Mousier for breakfast and might say it was the best thing I ate in Seattle. We went to Spur Gastropub for Valentines day and though it was tasty, they didn't serve enough food or drink in the set menu and at $85 for food and $40 for wine it was just too much for what it was. Cool place and atmosphere and maybe the regular menu is great. I would try again. I would stay here again, I just can't wait to be able to use the restaurant and bar.

Everything here is being renovated and meals and cocktails must all be taken in makeshift hotel banquet rooms... no character whatsover.

Here's a quote from the room service menu (when public options are all under construction).... \"...Please note a 23% service charge and a $4.00 delivery charge is added to the bill.

From SEA-TAC airport a cab will run you about $45 dollars depending on the time of day. I walked in to the Hotel and was greeted promptly by a very freindly staff. Check in went smooth and quickly, although I guess one of thier machines was broken so they had to call someone else to type my card number into the machine. I was given my room keys and was off to my room. The room was very nice and the views were great. There are a lot of windows and they have the blinds open for you when you arrive. Closing them is a chore, but it is a pleasant one. On my desk there was also a small bottle of wine and a fruit and cheese plate with a letter welcoming me. I did not know whether or not this was complimentary or not so I did not endulge right away. The bathroom was quite large and the necessary bathroom amenities were there as well as some extra ones like face-wash that I notices was available. My search of the room continued as I found a small cupboard by the television contained some snacks such as snickers, almonds, M&Ms and other snacks. I looked around for the costs of these things but did not find any information. This becomes a reoccurring theme. Then I unlocked the mini bar to take a peek and again it was full of great items, but there was no information regarding a cost. Not wanting to pay an exorbitant amount for some M&Ms I simply closed the cupboard. I had arrived late in the evening and was hungry, again not wanting to pay for snacks I proceeded to look for the hotel guide to see if there were any restaurants in the area. I looked around the TV...nothing. I looked on the Desk, in the desk, in all of the night-stands and flat surfaces...nothing. The only thing I found was an art book and a \"W\" shopping magazine (apparently this hotel also sells clothes for some reason). Fed up with searching and my hunger growing I went to the front desk to ask. Again the front desk was very helpful when I asked about a sandwich place or a place to get something quick to eat, they pointed me to the subway. I got lost but it was not the fault of the hotel it was just my own curiosity. I found a Rock Bottom Brewery and then saw the subway on the way back. The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. The following morning I woke up at 3 am because I had flowin in form the East Coast. I waited until 7 and then remembered that I had heard the employee mention to the guest checking in in front of me something about breakfast. I was starving by this point so I called the front desk to cancel my wake-up call and asked about breakfast. They told me it was on the 2nd floor. I went down to breakfast and was greeted by a buffet of eggs and fruit and other meats. I though this was quite a good complimentary breakfast until the waiter dropped off the bill. It was only $22 bucks, but when you think it is complimentary, that is quite a shock. Maybe I would have known this if they had a hotel guide. We used the facilities for a conference and aside from the construction, which I knew about before attending, the facilities were amazing. The staff was quick to react to any request, and the water glasses were always filled with delicious water. I cannot mention enough how great the staff was. Check out was a breeze. My bill was under my door the morning I woke up and all I had to do was use the check-out feature on the TV and then leave my keys in the room. I did not get a chance to use the Acura experience by a fellow meeting attendee did and he had nothing but good things to say about it. Aside from the hotel guide that I wish they had, everything about this hotel was great, and I wish I could see it when the renovations are complete. I saw pictures and am sure it will be amazing.

Yes, there was still the black lacquer motif and a strange bedside device for time and, I guess, some other purposes.

It was late, so I anticipated the thumping beats and hip music. Somehow, they managed to, without walls or obvious blocks, to ensure that I did not have to yell or lean in to hear the desk clerk (Ashley?). She was perky and quick, and within a few moments I was off to the elevators. I later learned that they take a $150 hold as opposed to many other hotels\u2019 $100 hold, but that\u2019s not a dramatic amount, and it appears they credited it back to me without billing errors, so no worries\u2026 if the $50 makes a difference, you should probably not be staying at such a pricey hotel anyway, right? It is pricey. The room was clean. Noticeably. I appreciated the sofa that ran the length of the window, and think that if I were planning to travel with a group or have a romantic evening, this setup would be perfect. Who wants to sit on your bed with no back support? Not stodgy folks like me! There was also a DVD player. I like that.

I was in corner room 2012. I found the check in staff to be quite pleasant, and they quickly helped locate the valet so that I could park my car; I was surprised that no one was at the valet station for several minutes after I arrived, but I did arrive late on Sunday so it wasn't a big deal. I was offered the customary points bonus or wine (I am a platinum level guest) and told about the gym (pretty nice compared to many other hotels). It was an easy checkin and a welcome experience after my trip. The room was very nice, and during my stay the only complaint I have is that an awful lot of street and HVAC noise made it into the room. So much that I had a hard time sleeping on Wednesday night when the wind blew just right and made some noise at the window. I'm not sure what the solution is for this. The tv remote works flawlessly, and it was neat that there was a DVD player in the room - although I did not use it. I was very comfortable overall. There was only one thing that marred my experience: the last interaction with the front desk this morning. I noticed that I was charged $45.14 for parking vs. The advertised $37, so I wanted to find out why. I asked the young man and young lady at the desk this morning about the discrepancy. I was told that the city tax had been included in the total, and that it was on the sign as $37 + tax. I told them I felt it was a bit like a bait and switch, but that I understood and felt that perhaps it would be helpful to have the tax as a seperate line item on the reciept - to avoid this issue in the future. There was some back and forth conversation about the tax, and I reiterated that I felt it should be a seperate line item, like other Starwood hotels in the area. In response, the young man smirked at me and told me that all the hotels in the area do it this way (they don't), and that it was 'clearly on the sign'. I am sorry, but at midnight on a rainy Sunday night it isn't clear, and I certainly don't appreciate being laughed at. As a former employee of the Westin Kierland I know the level of service expected by Starwood employees. This fell FAR below expectations. I felt stupid and insulted and like I told you as I walked out the door: I'll just stay at the Sheraton next time: the only issue there is that they're often full. This can be fixed, which is why I am posting this review. Starwood hotels have been and will continue to be my first choice when travelling. I would recommend this hotel, but only as second choice to the Sheraton for business travelers.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC", "Title": "\u201cOverall a very good experience\u201d", "Author": "DiscerningDiva", "ReviewID": "UR118708831", "Content": "We stayed at the W in Seattle last week for a conference. This is a business-oriented hotel situated within the downtown financial district, within easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, numerous restaurants, and shopping. What impressed us most during our stay at the W were the staff. Often times, staff attitudes to guests can make or break the experience but every staff member with who we interacted was incredibly professional, efficient, friendly, and welcoming (other hotels could learn a thing or two from the W Seattle about guest relations)! We had opted to upgrade to a Spectacular Room (room category) on the 20th floor and were happy to have done so, given the traffic sounds from below. Having researched this property earlier, I was already aware of the advertised room rates but as this was our conference venue we were fortunate enough to obtain a corporate rate. While the room was spacious and the bed was comfortable, the accommodations overall were still slightly underwhelming (definitely not \"Spectacular\"). The room easily showed signs of wear and tear-----scuffed walls, worn furniture and upholstery----that truly should have been corrected to help justify the pricey room rates and to stay within standards one would expect of the W Hotel brand. Other practical suggestions on areas to improve are: \u2022 Improve the lighting in the room, particularly the bathroom----there\u2019s nothing worse than trying to apply makeup using lighting that gives everyone and everything a jaundiced cast. \u2022 Install a towel hook on the back of the bathroom door----the current hook is impractically placed on the VERY narrow strip of wall between the bathroom door and the start of the shower tiles, so hanging anything on it will prevent the door from closing unless the object is first moved. \u2022 Provide a recycling bin to help reduce waste. \u2022 Provide a plastic bag/liner for the ice bucket----this is much more hygienic, given that one simply cannot be certain of how well the bucket is washed out between guests. The lounge/bar was quite busy. Also be warned that only valet parking is available at this hotel, at the cost of $45.00 per day.

The restaurant was up to scratch, great breakfast with unlimited strong coffee. Room service was very quick the few times I used it. As ever it is the staff (not the rooms) that make a hotel and they were top notch. What I like about them is that you can sit at the bar on your own and they know just how intrusive to be. Like most W bars this one was used by non-residents so there is always a great vibe and someone to chat to. Excellent cocktails and draft beers at the usual expensive Seattle prices.

We are SPG gold members and this was one of several options we had to redeem points for a pre-cruise stay. The reception area is very nice with a large bowl of apples available for snacks. There is usually spa water or coffee available too. The room was nice. We had two queen beds and a couch built into the window. The heavenly bed that each room comes with always ensures me that I will be sleeping well. The bathroom was decent sized too. Accessibility was the main plus for this hotel. Getting to the hotel was super easy. We like taking public transportation that is easy to use and Seattle is a great city for using buses and trains. We took the light rail from the airport to the hotel as we were not in any hurry. It was so cheap, about $3 per person and we got off one block from the hotel. Our main problem is that we travel very heavy and had to haul 250 pounds of luggage up the hill one block to the hotel. Even that wasn't too bad. In comparison, we could have taken a taxi for about $50. The hotel offered the Acura test drive experience where you could get a free ride around town within 5 miles of the hotel. We arranged for a ride to the cruise ship the next day which saved about $15 in taxi fares. All our saved transportation fees covered our extra baggage fees for the airline! Location was good although there seemed to be a Westin closer to the big mall in the center of town that had the monorail to the Space Needle. However, the W was located in an area where you could get on any public bus and travel. We enjoyed a nice walk both mornings of our stay to the first Starbucks at Pike Place to get coffee although there was another Starbucks just across the street from the hotel (and practically every corner in between). A big plus was that after the cruise, the W held our luggage for us until we were ready to travel to the airport. We took a taxi back from the cruise ship, checked in our luggage, and walked around town.

The biggest highlight of the entire stay was the food. We ordered room service three times, and ate dinner at Earth & Ocean one night. Everything we ate was perfectly cooked, seasoned, and delicious! The biggest downside of the stay was getting in touch with the staff. Even before I arrived in Seattle, I called to ask questions, and could not get through to anyone. I even sent an email to Whatever/Whenever that was never returned. When we arrived, we called room service a few different times and it just rang and rang. However, once we got them on the phone, it was smooth sailing. The same went for the front desk. When I arrived at the hotel, I did not know that the parking/valet was located on the side of the building, so I called the front desk while sitting on 4th avenue to find out where to go.

The room was small, lacked all hope for trendy and upscale, and was layed out like a Best Western. Valet parking was awful. I understand it is Seattle and parking is like oil, expensive. However, to bleed your paying guests out of $45 (including tax) a day to park, you should look at some other options. Another fee to add to the fun, use of the fitness center! The only bright spot was location. It was easy to walk to any place we wanted. Unfortunately at their concierge, the girl giving directions was off on one of our locations by six blocks. Another time we asked for the nearest US Bank and were sent to the convention center (several bloacks away). Later that weekend we walked one block down from the hotel and surprise there was a US Bank. - Once again, lacking in \"spectacular\".

The next morning, after my shower, the tub wouldn't drain and the bath was filled with about 1/2 a foot of the shower water. As such my friend couldn't take a shower. So we went out and told the guy at the desk about the issue, which he promised to address. He gave us 2 free drink tickets for the lounge, which was fine, if underwhelming.

I've always enjoyed my stays at W Hotels, and the W Seattle upheld this tradition. Arrived via the Light Link Train from the Sea-Tac airport. This has an easy commute and a great bargain for only $2.50 fare per person. The University station is only one block from the W hotel entrance. If you like the vibe of the W Hotels, you'll enjoy a stay here. The Seattle W is one of the more 'subdued' of the W family, but it's still very much a W - lots of great architecure near the hotel. Seattle Library (amazing modern design) and the grand Olympic hotel on the opposite side. The W building itself is a striking building, bands of dark glass alternating with white facade of the building - topped with a metal mesh pyramid on the roof - very easy to spot from all over the city. I arrived at the hotel around 2:30 and was greeted by a lovely and professional young woman at the Welcome Desk. She graciously upgraded me to a 'spectacular' room, which are found on the higher floors (for a better view). The lobby was lovely - nice earth tone funiture, an inviting fireplace, with soaring ceilings. My room was on the 15th floor, facing 4th street and Elliott Bay water view. The style of the rooms and corridors was consistent with other W's - hip, modern style with an aura of cool luxury. Room was quite spacious, spotlessly clean and everything was in perfect working order. I particularly loved the sofa seat in the window. I could sit there and relax while enjoying the city view. A/C -ventilation worked well. I never heard any noise from others in the hotel. The W bed is decadant - couldn't wait to get into the bed each nice - loved the sheets and the pillows! The bathroom was very large - the towels, bathrobe, and toileties were so luxurious. Used the Sweat Fitness Center two times - wonderful facility with top-notch equipment and super-clean. Took advantage of the free Wheels service for a ride to the Olympic Sculpture park - awesome ride and very professional service. Room was serviced very well and timely. Ate at the hotel's restaraunt - Earth & Ocean for one dinner and both breakfasts - it was awesome. The duck and charcuterie plates were fabulous - provided the best dinner that I had for my entire Seattle trip. The adjacent bar had a nice happy hour in the late afternoon and again in the late evening - awesome drinks - loved the lemon drop in particular. Only negatives that come to mind are rather insignificant: I could never find the concierge at the desk in the Living Room - I didn't really need his/her services, but it would have been nice to get a city walking map.

I am right in the target demographic for Ws so am not going to be one of those who complains that it is too dark/hip etc. I get and love the W concept, but this location has either become way too hip in its own mind, or has too many 20 somethings running the place and staying there on expense accounts. I Called down 3 times at 2 am one night to complain about the drunk kids running around and yelling obcenities in the hallways. The person answering the phone appeared to be amused. Perhaps so, but I think it is reasonable to expect some sleep at a hotel and ask security to take care of it. On two consecutive mornings requests for follow up wakeup calls were ignored. Rooms look dirty, dated and worn and show signs of previous guests. Stains on the carpet and the window seats. Scratches and sticky goopy material on wall (like coke or tobacco tried not to look to closely). Bathrooms dated and showers dripping and worn. After the reaction from staff to basic requests (like directions etc.) I just didn't bother trying to get any help - it was clear they didn't really care or want to be bothered with guest issues. All in all, this has been my go to hotel in Seattle for business for the last 5 years, but I will likely be moving elsewhere for the next visit. If you need a starwood property the sheraton and Westin are much more centrally located, and the Sheraton especially seems to be working hard at its customer service.

Perfect location in what looked to be the business end of town, awesome restaurants all around, making for hard decision making for meals. A Starbucks directly across the street!! (It is Seattle afterall) Within walking distance of local market and sites. Monorail easy to access by foot and of course the Macy's and Nordstroms so close. Loved our corner suite room and the generous bottle of wine gifted for our recent wedding. Would have loved to have had a refrigerator in room so we could have snacks and cold beverages, without breaking into the $$$ W snack/bev fridge. One must try the sexy fries and cocktails at the lounge bar! Oh and the bacon in the restaurant for breakfast, the best I have ever had! The W Seattle had set the bar with service, decor, comfort and style.

My first stay was at the W Chicago City Center in 2009. I loved that stay, as the hotel was beautiful, modern, but very comfortable! The W Seattle, however fell short by the standards set by the W Chicago. My understanding is that the W Seattle is one of the earliest W's built and opened, and that it's the least ostentatious of the properties. Indeed, the room didn't feel very 4 star. The wood decor was chipping and pealing, the bathroom was dirty with a broken showerhead, and there was little of the whimsical enhancements from my previous W stay, just a bed, TV, and bathroom. The bed, was comfortable, as was to be expected from a Starwood property. The Valet park took quite a bit of time, and I had to park on the street for 20 minutes with my hazards on - it was the middle of December, and the sign said full except for guests, so I'm not faulting them. Check in was easy, and I was upgraded to a Spectacular room. The desk clerk noted my previous W visit and assured me that they had added a coffee maker to my room. I'm used to having one in my room, and the Chicago W made sure to round one up for me, and promised that there would always be one when I returned t other hotel. I was expecting this in Seattle, however, there was no coffee maker in my room. A call to the whatever, whenever service revealed a person who said frankly, 'the W doesn't have coffeemakers, but let me see what I can do.\" She never called back. Positives included the restaurant, which did a custom vegan tasting meal for my friend. The staff was exceptional, and the food was seasonal, inspired, and delicious. I highly recommend Earth and Ocean whether you stay at the W or not. In all, I can't see the value in the W compared to the Westin (the original Starwood Westin flagship hotel) or the newly renovated Sheraton, or the Westin Bellevue. Seattle has some nice modern boutique hotels which have the polish, trip, and service down 100%, the W doesn't. The hotel is showing it's age (ironic for a hip hotel brand only a decade + in age). Particularly with the premium you pay for the W, I don't see why it should be a must-stay in Seattle. I didn't appreciate being promised something, and then when it didn't happen, I never got a response back from the staff.

I booked a room online & requested a king size bed in my reservation. When I got to my room I was given 2 queen size beds. Side note - unless queen size beds in the US are smaller, which I doubt, I would consider these beds double beds at best. When I called down to the front desk to voice my concerns & see if I could get a room as per my booking request, I was curtly told that there were no other rooms available, that I wasn't the only person who was not getting the King Size bed as requested, and that there was nothing he could do. No solutions, options or compensation offered for my dissatisfaction. 10 minutes after checking in to the Hotel, my key card wasn't working in the elevator. When i went to the front desk to get a new card, I observed the same front desk clerk issuing complimentary drinks at the hotel lounge to a few guests who were looking for something to do. REALLY - you're going to offer complimentary drinks to people who are bored but to your guests who are unsatisfied, nothing? I was given a new key card but each time I went in the elevator is took about 5-6 times before it actually worked & let me up the elevator (frustrating & embarrassing). The hotel building itself has incredibly bad insulation/sound proofing & I could hear my neighbours at all hours of the night & day. The room doors weren't properly aligned (or something) & extremely hard to close - you basically had to slam the door to close it. So again, loud noises as everyone around me was slamming their doors. And the final complaint - $15 for internet access? For the nightly rate @ the W, internet should be free!

I was excited about my stay at the famous \"W\" hotel but once we got here, I was a little let down. As others wrote, internet in the room is $15/day! \"W\"hat's UP with that?!?!? I traveled 6.5 weeks in the summer all over Canada and US and never ONCE paid for wifi! So this was disappointing to say the least. There is FREE wifi in the LOBBY (where I am now writing this review from) so I guess that's something. In the lobby (on Wednesday night, no less!) there was a huge disco type scene - very loud music, lots of people milling about. Too much I think. I guess there's a bar in the lobby. I actually couldn't tell cause it was soo dark, lights turned down and dark furniture and furnishings make for not being able to actually SEE what is there! The rooms are very nicely appointed but the covering on the bed is way too bulky and the room gets quite warm in the night (like the AC just clicks off after a certain time?!?).... so I called down and asked for a simple blanket. The one brought up was too small for our king bed so I had to call down to ask for another one. The bathroom is huge and very well lit - so if you need to actually see anything, you have to go into the bathroom. Huge tub, nice counter space, thick towels. Robe in closet, nice. No stand for luggage - again \"W\"hat's up with that?!?! There is a safe in the closet. Fridge is mini-bar style with extremely overpriced stuff in it. A small bottle of Fiji water on the bedside had a $5 tag on it. There is a bucket for ice and glasses for wine and a wine bottle opener. There is a DVD player and movies I understand you can get for a fee - I didn't check the price cause I was sure it was too much. The sound on the wall-mounted flat screen HDTV is limited and with the hum of the AC it makes certain programs hard to hear. The lighting in the room is horrible - it's supposed to make it all \"atmospheric\" but for middle aged people, as our vision starts to deteriorate, we need MORE light!! MORE LIGHT!!!! This is actually a common theme in a lot of hotels and a big bone of contention for me when traveling - but it was even darker here at the W. They are very kind and courteous to your every question or request. When you call the operator or front desk (or the \"W\"hatever/\"W\"henever line) they answer the phone with your name. Super duper service! The concierge is fabulous! Travis was particularly wonderful! The lobby has candles at the front desk check in. Dark wood and dark counter adds to the overall DARKNESS of the hotel. Parking for $44/valet per night is totally ridiculous. There is a lot next door for $30/nt I think. We didn't know about it til it was too late. You do need a room key to go up to the guest rooms which adds to security especially for single women traveling alone. But overall the W is highly overrated. I wish I could have given it a better review but most of the things that other people have written in their reviews were true and makes it not great for the price. I think the W is going for a different look with all the dark wood, candles, darkness in the rooms, loud music in the lobby.... but it does not inspire in me the desire to come back here any time soon. Perhaps the younger crowd loves it all. The older generation needs MORE LIGHT! For the money, stay somewhere else. The Crowne Plaza is supposed to be very nice. And even the Westin.

We've stayed at almost all of the major hotels (and some great B&B's) in Seattle and we looked forward to trying the W. As a loyal TA user we had read the wide range of reviews and were keeping our fingers crossed. We were not unhappy :) To begin with the staff were all very keen to please. They were incredible especially the concierge (Jay?) My one suggestion for all of Seattle's concierge is to \"Get outta the box\" and try some local restaurants outside of downtown. Seattle has an amazing culinary scene but it's not all downtown. The hotel location is fabulous and as long as you like the \"COOL' style they are going for you will like it. Dark hallways took some getting used to and I never did feel quite \"Mod\" enough but I wasn't uncomfortable. They offer towncar service but not at night(?), There aren't any coffee makers in the rooms but there are urns of Starbucks in the lobby in the AM and urns of lemon water in the afternoon. Our King room (1911?) was comfy although it smelled a lil stale on check in. The housekeepers either need more time or a kick in the butt as there was a lot of dust (look at the wine bottles) and the grout in the shower/tub could use a good bleaching. I'd suggest that the housekeepers lie down in the tub and see what it looks like under the taps. Don't get me wrong its not really dirty its just not top notch. Towels and Robe (why just 1?) were really nice and the bed and bedding were fabulous. The drapes are not black out. I liked the touch of having a DVD player in the room but ours was flaky. Maintenance was fast to respond to this issue when called. I also liked the window seat. Parking is the same nasty thing here as every hotel in Seattle. $37 a night. Why?

You\u2019ve chosen the best hotel in Seattle! Over the years I have become spoiled with the service and amenities provided by W Hotels all over the world, but the W Seattle is at the top of my list. My Dad and I live just east in Coeur D\u2019 Alene Idaho, so Seattle is a manageable drive giving us a great opportunity to relax, eat, drink and be merry. We\u2019ve stayed at the W Seattle five times now from Christmas through the baseball season. I realized I have been remiss in not providing a review for other travelers, as well as to show our appreciation for the fine service we always receive at the W Seattle. Initially, I contacted the W to inquire as to whether they were pet friendly and happily discovered that not only are they pet accepting but are pet LOVERS, a huge benefit as my Dad refuses to leave his small dog. We arrived at the W, greeted straight away by the very friendly and helpful valet attendants who whisked our bags into the hotel. The Valets gave incredible service, bountiful information and greeted us by name the whole weekend. They do charge for parking but having lived in metropolitan cities for many years this doesn\u2019t make me flinch. They do offer quick and courteous unlimited entry and exit, which many hotels do not. Check-in in the chic and modern lobby, complete with smooth music and original art, was flawless and efficient. The staff\u2019s friendliness and professionalism continued with our front desk attendant Mary who checked us in and also provided much valuable information. Tasty, fruit infused, chilled water was offered in the reception area of which we gladly accepted, being parched from our five hour drive. The lobby and lower \u201cLiving Room\u201d have a very cool jazz/Ibiza Lounge feel, coated with hip accents. At night Living Room turns into the place to see and be seen as the bar is just to the left, complete with a DJ spinning etherial music. The Living Room is also where I would take my morning cup of coffee and utilize the free wireless internet. I usually just pay for internet in the room but not wanting to disturb my pop who sleeps late these days, the Living Room is very comfortable and a good way to socialize with other early risers. Additionally, if you\u2019re a Starbuck\u2019s addict there\u2019s a location directly across the street from the Living Room. Our room was incredible. Upon entering we discovered another amazing W touch of class with the doggy bed, complete with personal food and water bowls and a name placard with \u201cLilly\u201d written on it. I believe there was even a toy of some sort for her. Both beds with incredible linens and comfort kept us sleeping like babies. To the far end of the room was a great window couch affording an incredible view of the Seattle skyline and an amazing place to sit and read, as well as enjoy our 4:30 cocktails before the ball game. The bathroom continued the flow of comfort and sophistication complete with Bliss Spa soaps, shampoo and lotion. I loved the Bliss products so much I\u2019m ordering them for home. The W Seattle is located perfectly just up and away from the hustle and bustle of Pike Market but close enough to walk. Shopping, dinning, museums, live entertainment, bars, and the waterfront are all easily accessible from the W. Because of my dad\u2019s age and replaced knees we usually walk DOWN and take a cab back from wherever we\u2019ve gone. A cab ride from the W too all the cool spots is $5 - $15, roughly. We\u2019ve eaten in Earth and Ocean, the in house dining option, on several occasions and have never been disappointed. The fare is good, the service friendly and attentive and price point is reasonable for a hotel restaurant. I will say I prefer breakfast there, great omelets and incredible seasoned new potatoes. In all fairness I must say that as a bit of a foodie I find it difficult to dine anywhere more than once, this is certainly true of hotel restaurants as well. So our not eating at Earth and Ocean every evening is more from my need to explore and discover new dining spots. Bottom line, the W Seattle is excellent, and we anxiously look forward to returning at every departure. I can\u2019t say that for too many things in life, especially hotels. So, book the room, enjoy the city and look for Mike and Ron, \u201cThe Bacon Boys\u201d sitting in the Living Room or the bar and join us for a cocktail.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cWOW, the W hotel in Seattle WA.!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "captainspeed", "ReviewID": "UR63442514", "Content": "My wife and I spent a long weekend at the W hotel in Seattle this last week.

Which is what we asked for in the first place at the consierge. The 2nd night, we had a different guy working for we asked for a mexican food option. We told the consierge about our previous night. We told him - casual mexican. He hailed us a cab and off we went. The cab driver couldn't find the place - cost us $20 cab fare and then he dropped us off at some wierd, freaky tequila bar in the middle of nowwhere. Not a mexican restaurant. Not a place for a young yuppie couple either. Thought we'd entered the Twilight Zone. Had to find a cab back. The parking people didn't know of any mexican places so we ended up and the nearby mall (since it was after 8) and ate there. Ok, if you are the W, and are a prissy as you make your hotel to be - please note that not everyone staying there is as \"metropolitan\". When you see two people in jeans and gap sweatshirts asking for a dinner recommendation, don't send them to a black tie restaurant OR a gay tequila bar! Ruined our trip totally at night. I was super mad, but my hubby held me back from yelling at both men. I think the hotel needs to hire a few more quality workers AND a few front desk people who know how to smile - GEEZ, what a downer the front desk is! It's like they are so unhappy to see you. The room is fine though....if that's all you're looking for Oh yeah, also $38 per day for parking!!!!", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cWhy W?\u201d", "Author": "myparis2009", "ReviewID": "UR49571640", "Content": "Here are my reasons why I have chosen W several times before and still seriously consider it every time I travel to Seattle. Ambiance, rooms & restaurants: W Seattle has a boutique feel to it and you feel chic the moment you step inside. I am particularly fond of the lounge in the evening, when local or not, beautiful people come for drinks (and sometimes food). The rooms are fine, nothing extraordinary but definitely won't dissapoint. I don't have the same complaints as many others do about the dark hallways and elevators. It's nice in a way but I find the dimmed lighting more Vegas than luxe. It's a colour preference perhaps. The restaurant is expensive and the food subpar. I've only eaten brunch there and try not to do that if I don't have to. Service: Don't expect great service from the front desk, concierge, lounge servers or at the restaurant. Room service is also slow and so is housekeeping. The staff seem to have received no training in customer service. Distance to shops: It's a bit of a walk but all downhill. If you want proximity to Nordstrom, Hyatt is your hotel but I prefer W and just walk 5 min. to Nordstrom. Overall: If your stay is a short one which wouldn't give rise to too many interactions with the hotel staff, then W is a great place to stay. It's definitely worth a try for you to form your own opinion.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "worldtraveler1Usa", "ReviewID": "UR49207165", "Content": "I travel on business to Seattle every week and stayed at the W for 2-3 days a week for the past 3 months.

The hotel was the one chosen for my husband with his business travel. The beds were very comfortable, though the scenery for us wasn't the best, as we had the view of a parking garage. This sits only about four blocks from the Harbor, though walking there was hard for us, as the hills are so steep. We had a nice restaurant at the hotel, but they had blaring music at the bar next to it and so it wasn't the easiest place to relax in. The food was excellent, (prime rib), but the cost for the meals were a bit pricey. It was in the hub of all the best shopping places that you could find! They had numerous high designer shops all the way down to Ross for Less. They had a nice German Restaurant, called Gordon Biersch at a mall a few blocks away in a wonderful three or four story mall. Great taxi drivers in the area and all seemed hospitable and those in Seattle just seemed laid back and relaxed sort of folks. Would love to go back again. Only negative is the loud, blaring music in the bar, but if you like trendy music, then you would like that too. Saw the Seattle Space Needle, which is a must for Seattle travlers. Must have their lunch or dinner package when you are there, which is pricey, at about 100 dollars for two people, but the Space Needle rotates and you get a complete view of the Seattle horizon. One of the prettiest skylines at night that I have ever seen!!! Had to pay for internet use in room, but the package was about forty dollars for a few days. Great fish meals at the harbor!

Pretty much everyone we encountered were not outright rude, but they all just seemed indifferent. Like they never really seemed to interact with the guests as I've encountered at other hotels. I can't compare my experience with other W's since this was my first stay, but I hope the other ones have a more upbeat and lively staff. The front desk staff seemed blah, the bartenders weren't very happy the way I'm used to bartenders being. Is it just Seattle and the gloomy weather? Or is it really that bad working at the W Seattle?

There's also no coffee/tea in the room, and no microwave/ coffee pot so that you can make your own. So if you want some morning caffeine, which seems like a pretty basic amenity, you either have to pay about $12 for room service ($6 for the drink, plus $4 delivery, and other charges) or get dressed and head out to the Starbucks across the street. Also, the bar/restaurant downstairs is a total scene, which, depending on your point of view, is probably either really cool or kind of depressing. And the lighting in the hallways is so dark you can't even see your room number. Like another reviewer said, it's eerie, not cool. All in all, there's a lot to like at the W, but I'm not in a hurry to go back there.

I was impressed by the trendy decor and friendly staff. The second time, I felt the same about the hotel, except that I had noticed that the staff was colder and didn't exude much of a welcoming attitude(especially one of the rude concierge team members). This most recent time (July 2-5, 2009), I realized that I am officially over this W location. The employees were very aloof for the most part - and the ones who weren't aloof, just weren't very friendly and warm. There was the lovely housekeeper on our floor who was cheery and happy. And there were also the semi-friendly bartenders, although one was telling us about how unsafe the parking garage is at this hotel and how many break-ins have taken place (!!) And don't get me started on the sleazy-looking concierge staff! The hotel is also looking a little worn-around-the-edges and definitely needs a little sprucing up. And the \"hip\" factor that the W Brand has tried so hard to establish is gone. Now it seems as though the hotel is appealing to a more low-rent crowd (there were the young couple who were being sexually active in the hallway as the elevator door opened and the guy came in with me, while zipping up his pants). I'm just over it. For my next visit to Seattle, I will definitely try one of the newer boutique hotels or the Doubletree Arctic Club. W Seattle is still a clean, comfortable hotel. I have never had an awful experience here. But it has just lost a lot of it's unique appeal - partly attributed to the unfriendly, unmotivated employees and the lack of a \"WOW\" factor.

Apparently, the cruise ships take off on Sundays and most hotels are booked on Saturday nights in the summer. So we decided to try a W for the first time. Never again. First off, the rate was ridiculous. We paid $264/night and the parking was $43 a night! When we first checked in, we had to ask twice for help with our luggage. The check-in staff were not especially friendly either. The concierge was very rude and it felt like we were a bother when asking questions. Not only that, but the guy gave us false information saying that it takes a good 3.5 to 4 hours to drive to Mt. Ranier and discouraged us from going. We went anyway, and it took only 2 hours to get there! The room was ok, albeit very small. Nothing spectacular here. The lobby was dimly lit and cramped. There was barely any room to move around when there were a large number of guests checking in. We were traveling with our 2 young kids (9 and 4). The entire time we were there we got looks from the other guests. It really felt like kids were not welcome there. This was very discouraging. Our youngest child has a lot of food allergies, mainly peanuts and eggs. My wife had called a week in advance and talked to the front desk manager and the chef at the restaurant and told them about the allergies and what he can and can't have. They assured us that they would purchase the necessary items so that he could enjoy eating breakfast with the rest of us. When we got there, they had no clue about his allergies and had done nothing to prepare in advance! They offered him a bowl of fruit for breakfast. My wife was furious!

I have always wanted to stay here, I have eaten in the restaurant before and it was beautiful. Overall this was a great hotel. It doesn\u2019t really need to be said that it is an amazing property. The rooms were incredibly decadent, very modern d\u00e9cor, lovely furniture. Our room had a chaise lounge in it overlooking the corner windows which though it said floor to ceiling, the rooms are pretty short in height so it\u2019s not as incredible as I thought it would be. However, don\u2019t get me wrong it was still beautiful. The bed was incredibly luxurious and comfortable. The room was actually pretty big with a beautiful desk and the bathroom was quite swanky, though it didn\u2019t have a soaking tub or jet tub which I had tried everywhere to find out and couldn\u2019t on the website. It\u2019s your basic tub with shower set up. Now I know. We were on the 12th floor so it was just city views, in fact we looked at the back of the Four Seasons. But city streets otherwise. Higher floors may have more impressive views. It was quite a luxurious experience. My husband had bought me roses and so we called down and asked if they could bring us up a vase and within 2 minutes we had a knock on the door and a couple of options of vases. The location is great, it\u2019s a little more in the business area of town, but only a couple blocks from some great shopping. The bar is actually in the lobby of the hotel, as in, it sort of is the lobby of the hotel so you can just sit by the fire or anywhere on the sofas or chairs and they will come and get your order. We did not eat in the bar or the restaurant so I can\u2019t speak to that experience, though it looked lovely. It was a little full of itself. Check-in was a little frosty, and the bar as well seemed a bit pretentious. But if you just overlook all of that and enjoy the hotel for it\u2019s beauty and comfort, it\u2019s perfect! We had room service in the morning which was amazing. The presentation was incredible and the food was tastey. It\u2019s a rather pricey hotel, I found a great rate online the week of our plans so it was nice to get it all at a bit of a deal, but even so, it\u2019s definitely a splurge. I would stay here again if I found a deal, but otherwise, I am not sure full price would have been worth it.

We felt as though they didn't want to be bothered by a hotel guest. The workout facility at the hotel, in short, was downright awful. A hotel of this caliber cannot have such poor equipment in such a cramped, depressing space and expect people to believe this is a luxury hotel. Imagine a guest room with the furniture removed and then replaced with broken, out dated exercise equipment. Thankfully we had a friend in town who gave us passes to the Washington Athletic Club -- which was AMAZING. We were also disappointed to discover that the W does not provide an in-room coffee pot. This seems like such a standard thing these days. Why don't they have one at this hotel? Another thing that bothered us was the lack of lighting in the hallways. We actually laughed when we tried to get into our room b/c we couldn't see the card reader on our door. There is hip, and then there is just plain stupid. Finally, we requested and received a room on one of the non-smoking floors. One of the other patrons on the floor ignored the hotels' rules and smoked in their room four out of the five days we were there (we assumed they checked out before us). We called guest services the first day, no longer able to tolerate the smell in our room, and were told something would be said to them or they would be asked to move to the smoking floor. They were not spoken to. After calling guest services again on the third day they told us they would move US to a different room...I couldn't understand why we would be inconvenienced instead of those who were not complying with the rules of the hotel. It was clear that they never said anything to the guests who were smoking b/c it didn't stop. We gave up and breathed in the smoke for the rest of our stay.

I had never been to Seattle, and decided to come a bit early to see the sights. I left my husband at home, and this was my first solo trip in quite some time. I chose the W for the location and the price, and the reputation of W hotels in general--I had never stayed at one before. Let's start with the positives. The room was excellent--great decor, comfy bed, nice flat screen TV, great quality toiletries (although i question the scent combo of lemon and sage... too cleaning-product-y for me). The darkness and loudness in the common areas took some getting used to, but it certainly makes for a cool, chic vibe in the hotel. Very different from the average Marriott or Sheraton I typically stay in. I also enjoyed the free Wi-Fi in the lobby one evening with a great apple martini. Oh, and the location was excellent. Very quick and FLAT walks to the \"main attractions.\" And now, the negatives. As a married woman traveling alone, it took me a little while to be at ease with being on my own, especially dining solo and such. I went to the concierge desk on the first evening, having just arrived in Seattle an hour or so ago, and was hoping for a little encouragement and some great recommendations from them. Uh, no. Granted, partially my fault for wanting to be babied, but this desire came from previous experiences with concierges in other cities--usually they're excited to tell you where to go, what to do, and to introduce you to their city. Not so much with this guy. He acted totally put off and aloof and I felt like I wasn't cool enough or something. The next day, I tried again with a different concierge. He was more helpful, but definitely not at the level I'm used to. I was inquiring about the ferry to Bainbridge Island, and he told me all about it but didn't bother to provide a schedule. When I asked specifically where I could get a schedule, he said, \"Oh, I have one right here.\" Um, wouldn't it seem the natural thing to do to hand that to me when you're telling me how to get there and how often it leaves?? While the concierge service is really my only complaint about the W Seattle, it was poor enough for me to knock the rating down to a 3 because, to me, if you're going to present yourself as a luxury hotel, you need luxury service to earn an above average rating.

When we got to the bottom of the staircase leading to check-in the bellman could not have been nicer. He got an extra guy to help with all of our gear. Both check ins were smooth, staff lovely, room was great. The second check-in was particularly nice, as one of the young ladies behind the desk made a special point to welcome my son back to the hotel with a high five and \"It's great to see you again\". Went a long way. We had a view of Mt. Rainier the first leg, lower down the second. Room service during both stays was excellent. The lobby was lovely to hang out in, the restaurant was very, very good. To the concierge problem...we dealt with three concierges during our stays. Two of which were fine, one simply didn't do his job or meet our requests. First, he was on his cell phone at the concierge desk and seemed annoyed that we interrupted him. We wanted to make dinner reservations for two nights and asked whether we needed reservations for a third restaurant. It was early in the day, he said the first two would not be open, but would make the reservations later and noted it on the computer. He then said we did not need reservations at the third. That was that, thanks!, and we were on our way. Later that evening, we arrived at the 'no reservation' restaurant to discover a two hour wait for a table of three and \"Oh no, we ALWAYS recommend reservations.\" Hmmm, basic info a concierge should know. We walked back to the hotel to check on the other reservations with the evening concierge. Neither had been made.

We stayed for the Fourth of July weekend. We waited to talk to the concierege 3 times. Each time it took fifteen minutes for anyone to help us, and each time, the person in that position began his reponse by asking if we were sure we wanted him to check on our requests. For instance, I requested the conierge make an arrangement with a taxi for the end of our dinner. We were headed to the space needle afterwards. His response was \"well, I don't think you'll be able to get a cab tonight. It's really busy. Are you sure you want me to call? You should probably try calling them yourselves.\" We had already called, and I don't fault the guy for failing (although, having bus schedules on hand seems like a prudent alternative), but of course I want him to call! I just waited 15 minutes to see if the W name would help us at all. We cut our losses when we tried to rent bikes. After waiting 15 minutes, we weren't even the second group in line. Calling from the room did little good either. Another time, I watched the concierge tell a woman that there was nowhere she could dine on the Fourth of July. Afterwards, I pulled her aside and gave her the list of places I had found on my own (I spent no more than 20 minutes on this research). I had already called the places, and all said they were slow for the Fourth and thus had plenty of room. Bear in mind that I had never even been to Seattle before that weekend. In fact, at the time of the conversation, I had barely been there 24 hours. I also have to mention that I did all of this research through my mobile phone because the W Seattle does not provide free WiFi. They don't want to help you find anything, and they don't want you to find it on your own either. It's like a casino where everything is designed to keep you within the establishment. We had to hail our own cabs right outside the hotel, and on our last day, as we were leaving, the doormen were too busy talking to one another to help me when I tripped going out the door.

Yes the lighting in the halls was dark, but i must say i loved it even though i got turned around almost every time i stepped off the elevator - oh well i was on vacation. That was another plus, hip elevator music - refreshing. Lot's of activity in the Lobby at night, DJ spinning..etc very cool. Staff all young, so much so i wasn't sure i could count on getting my wakeup call, but it came right on time.

This was after we paid in full, at the time of booking, and we were told to let them know if there was anything they could do to make our stay better, to let them know. I parked in the hotel parking lot for $35.00! What a rip-off! 2 people actually tried to open our door! And they were sucessful! The few things we needed were not dealt with, and when my husband brought a bag to the front desk before our dinner reservation , he was told they would send it to our room. We made it back to find a huge crowd, listening to some techno beat music in the bar. The bartender was a rude young kid, and thought he was Tom Cruise in \" Cocktail\". When we made up to our room, the bag was no where in site! I went down to the front desk, where I was basically told, that we made it up . The bag was no where to be found , with brand new clothes from Macys in it. I waited until morning to talk to the manager, who was at least friendly, and after awhile, he found the missing bag!! Wow, imagine that! You would assume that everyone employed by a 5 star hotel, would have to meet the requirement of overly friendly , but not here. I had better service and a nicer hotel, just a few streets away at the Warwick! The room was dusty, and don't even think about drinking the water.

Once a flagship of THE W chain, she is showing a little bit of wear and tear here and there. The Staff was great as expected except the concierge, who was was a bit too impressed with himself. The hallways/elevators are very dimly lit, with a sexy ambiance, this hotel is for the movers and shakers, the style makers, or people who think they have style! I personally love it. Once inside the rooms you have the wonderful signature W Beds which are quite simply amazing. One of the most comfortable beds you will experience. Mod decor abounds in the rooms with great flat screen TVs and a well appointed bathroom. All of the Bathroom products are provided by BLISS Spa's and you will want to take home the face wash and body lotion, they are that good! My only complaint (and to some this may be a plus) is that it is difficult to get the rooms dark. When I am in Seattle I work late and sleep in, I am usually upgraded to a Corner King room which has amazing views but is difficult to darken, especially when I want to sleep in. The blinds are a so-so at best shutters that just don't block sunlight (reason why I have been over at The Hyatt lately instead). The restaurant /room service is amazing and the bar is great. Last year Quentin Tarantino was at the bar with a lady friend having a drink on a Thursday night! (I don't spot too many celebrities in my hotel travels) No coffee makers in the rooms (urghh pet peeve!) I like to make a cup of coffee without having to go downstairs for the free coffee or order a $16 small pot from room service. Overall though it is a wonderful property with a great location and good staff, on the trendy, high-end side of things so if you are stuffy and grumpy or like to get to bed very early, try the Fairmont next door (which has the best Oysters and Salmon in Seattle at the restaurant \"Shucker's\" on their ground floor.)

However, this W is just average. POSITIVES: 1. Location. Its right in the heart of downtown. 2. The bed. This is a given in a W which, I believe, all use the \"Hevenly Bed.\" I love this bed, it is pillowed topped and has nice linens and a huge (and heavy) down comforter. It is so confortable. I was so impressed with this bed the first time I stayed at a W in 2002 that I actually bought one. So its nice to have the same bed in the hotel that I enjoy every night at home. NEUTRALS: 1. The room. It was nicely appointed and had a nice window seat with lots of funky pillows. However, the view was of a hotel accross the street and as far as the theme of the room, I felt it was mediocre at best when comparting it to other W rooms I've visited in other states (like San Diego or New Orleans). 2. The staff. They were average at best, nothing out of the ordinary. Not particularly friendly or helpful but definately not rude, pushy or mean. NEGATIVES: 1. The lobby. Its tiny as compared to many Ws I've stayed in and the bar, while nice is TINY and often too crowded to even get a seat. One thing I've always enjoyed about Ws is the club-like feel of their lobbies and the cool bar scene. This W has neither. 2. The elevator and hallways. They are extremely dark!! It is bizzare how dark they are. Maybe its to hide the fact that this hotel is an older hotel that's been renovated to become a W and so they darker down the hallways so that you can't see the age of it. However, I found it a tad unnerving and I'm a guy. 3.

Microsuede couch, comftorable bed, plasma tv with dvd player. It was nice after a long day to order room service and watch a movie. They also have an extensive library of cds, movies, and newspapers. We did not take advantage of this but the pay per view movie list was also convenient and featured new releases. When we checked in they had popsicles in ice buckets sitting out. Nice touch. All of the staff is very friendly and helpful. They will bend over backwards to keep you happy. Anytime I called down for something, it was taken care of right away.

Also, we stopped by the front desk at about midnight and asked for a wake-up call for the next morning as we had an international flight to catch, but the call never came, and our 'backup' alarm never went off - so we missed our flight.

I arrived early in the a.m. so my room wasn't ready but they checked me in and sent me a text message when it was. I found that pretty cool. Rooms were extravagent, great Starwood/Sheraton-esque beds. Though one downside was the halls were a little dark (typical of a trendier hotel, like those you see in NYC). The bar in the lobby was always jumping and I heard from some other guests that the breakfast was excellent. When I checked in they gave me 2 drink coupons. Hit up Belltown section (short walk) of the city. Great restaurants and cuisine of every kind! BlueWater Grille on Lake Union is also very good.

Depending on your personal point of view, you may find this refreshing, surprising, and wonder why there aren\u2019t more people doing this sort of thing. Or, you may feel that these are just trashy gimmicks directed at the hi-tech minded and geeky. So what\u2019s different? First thing is that instead of the gushing and verbose service that many concierges and reception staff employ, this luxury hotel employs people who give the impression that everything is no big deal, easily accomplished and in fact hardly worth a mention. In fact, they are often smiling but very direct and to the point in the delivery of their message. Some could mistake this for coolness and disinterest. Throughout the hotel alternative language abounds \u2013 the Concierge desk is titled: Whatever, Whenever. The sign for your door to ensure privacy says: Not Quite Yet! The second thing is d\u00e9cor. The reception area is minimalist meets gothic, with a touch of modern art, all dimly lit. At night the lights are even lower and the fireplace surrounded by candles is a centrepiece. Low coloured lights in corridors and hallways combined with vibrant carpets extend the effect of being in some kind of club. Music is the third thing: ambient techno and jazz will accompany you everywhere except in your room. It all combines with the d\u00e9cor and the attitude to impress upon you that you are part of a hip and cool experience. Rooms are also minimalist, although spacious. Our \u201cCool Corner Room was exactly that, affording a great view of the city on from two aspects at fifteen floors elevation. Everything works, and works well in this hotel, especially technology. Your Flat Screen TV, DVD, Internet are all there, and the lobby if full of laptop users, also enjoying a cocktail. These are the sort of people that feel that a computer is an integral part of life, not just a machine with which you work. On Saturdays the reception and bar area becomes a disco \u2013 still in the techno theme, and is obviously a cool Saturday evening rendezvous for locals and visitors alike. But, don\u2019t think this hotel is exclusively for the young; its more that its designed to make you feel young, whatever your age. We say everyone from 18 to 80 in evidence, and most seemed to be enjoying the experience. We noted several Brides in their gowns arriving after their happy day, en route to a memorable night. So, if you are the sort that might like your hotel experience to be something new and different try a W \u2013 and the Seattle W is a great one to try, both for quality and location. If you prefer leather sofas, marble floors and tradition, there\u2019s a wonderful Fairmont around the corner, but why not give the W a try just one time?

The location is excellent for shopping and sight seeing.

My wife had expressed an interest in staying at the W so I booked a stay there as part of a Mother's Day weekend celebration. Shortly after booking the room through the Starwood website, I received an email offer to upgrade to a \"Spectacular\" room for $30, which I accepted. I also requested to have a special music CD playing when we entered our room. Via email I was connected with Adam Sinding who was my \"Insider\" for this request. I arranged to drop off the CD the day before our arrival. Adam was not there when I arrived for the drop-off and I was referred to the young concierge. She struck me immediately as affected and pretentious. I believe she had been trained that \"putting on airs\" somehow enhances the status of an establishment. I just find it off-putting. Be prepared for awkwardness on arrival at the W. The drive-up entrance is extremely poorly laid out. You basically are in the street when you pull up and configuration of car/pedestrian access to the check-in area is convoluted and congested. To simplify our arrival we just parked in the adjacent (to the east) Olympic Hotel parking garage and walked the 100 feet or so to the entry. Check-in went very nicely with the staff at the desk very friendly and helpful. (A quick note about staff, they seem to be uniformly amazingly young. This means that you should not expect a great breadth of experience in the hospitality industry.) Guests observed in the lobby area seemed mostly the t-shirt, grungy blue jean, running shoe crowd. This seemed a bit odd giving that the W is not really a cheap place to stay. One of the most striking aspects of the Seattle W is its decor and darkness. Lighting in the halls, elevators and other public spaces without windows is incredibly low and techno. For instance, one needs to be quite close (within a foot or two) of a room door to discern the room number. My wife called the decor \"urban zen\" and I think this is probably as good as any moniker. Our room was extremely nice and spacious. And yes, the CD was playing at an appropriate volume when we walked in. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room had very large windows with peek-a-boo views of Puget Sound. A full size chaise was along one wall next to a very nicely equipped desk. The bath was large and had more towels than anyone could use. The faucet handle on the tub/shower was close to breaking so controlling water temperature and pressure was quite difficult. When our car and driver arrived to take us to our evening activities we again were reminded of the extremely poor layout of access to the hotel. The combination of arriving and departing guests, aggressive taxi drivers whipping about and traffic wizzing by make entering and exiting more than an adventure. The Earth and Ocean Restaurant on-site again is very much on the trendy side. We found the staff extremely warm, friendly and professional. The menu selection could only be characterized as super-trendy. Fortunately, the W is in the heart of downtown so there are dozens of super dining options for those not in an adventurous culinary mood. One minor annoyance is that I still don't have a breakdown of what this little adventure cost. Apparently, the W billing system is not capable of providing an up-to-date itemization of charges upon check-out.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cA little too clubby for me\u201d", "Author": "djr76", "ReviewID": "UR7430500", "Content": "I have never stayed at a W before, I have had many a martini at the San Francisco W but never stayed over night.

Check in went smooth except that they stuck us in a room that looked out on to a parking garage (we asked for a nice view because it was my husbands birthday). Once we were switched we were fine with our room (even though no assistance was offered to move our luggage). The main problem that I had with this hotel is that I felt that it was trying to be so hard to be cool and hip that they over did it. I mean who really wants to walk into a blue dimly lit hallway at 10am or listen to house music in the restroom when you are heading out to breakfast. There is a time and place for these things and the morning did not feel like that time. Another strange thing that happened during our stay is that 20-30 young people were staying at the hotel (in their teens) and all the hallways reeked of pot. One day they camped out in the lobby and were sprawled across the couches and by the fire drawing pictures, reading magazines and on the floor taking naps for hours.

The downtown area is brimming with fabulous restaurants, cafes and other nightlife. Every member of staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The concierge was very knowledgable and was always kept busy. The hotel had lots of sitting areas. So, rather than being restricted to your room if you wanted to surf on your laptop or do some work, you could be part of the action and enjoy the fireplace and couches in the lobby or couches in the quieter section on the second floor. They played the best music all the time - like dance/house. Loved it! They had W candles burning all over, emanating a wonderful aroma/atmosphere. There was free Starbucks coffee in the bar area in the mornings. This little tidbit alas, we did not discover until the day we were leaving. The info was on a small card in the room but we missed it. There is a full service Starbucks right across the street. Being Seattle, there is a coffee shop on EVERY corner it seemed. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant the first morning. The decor was impressive but the service and food was lacking - especially for the price. This was our only disappointment. We would recommend that you grab your free Starbucks, walk a couple of blocks towards Pikes Place and enjoy breakfast in one of Seattle's great cafes. The Crumpet Shop for one is well worth a visit. The hotel bar was well stocked and the atmosphere pleasant in the evenings when it seemed to attract the high-flyers of the city. The location cannot be beat.

A friend was attending a conference there this week, so I joined for a 36 hour trip to Seattle. W Hotel is in a great location downtown--a few blocks from Pike and shopping. It does tend to play up the \"hip/trendy\" atmosphere with an attractive staff--definately seems to cater to the late-20's-30's crowd but I think anyone would be comfortable there. The bedding is simply marvelous--high quality mattress topped with a feather bed, down duvet, and lots of pillows. My friend and I ended up with a two bed room and while four probably could fit, the beds seemed more like doubles than queens--not sure what their real size was. It ended up working out great for us though. There is also a great large window seat that a doubles as a soft. We had a great city view on the 17th floor of the Seattle Public Library next door. (see photos) Wireless internet access is free in the lobby and the first three floors of the building (the conference center) and there are plenty of chairs and sofas around. It adds to the trendy atmosphere to actually have a buzz in the lobby. The charge per day for internet access in your room seemed excessive. The bathroom is well appointed with great Bliss products--lime and sage soap, facial wash, body wash, and lotion. A bottle of mouthwash would be handy for the hip/trendy crowd, I think. Bathrobes are included and soft and fluffy. Tube is large and water pressure poweful. I had no problems with housekeeping while I was there...my room was cleaned quite well. Breakfast was better than average at the lobby restaurant at typical hotel breakfast prices.

Unbelievably poor service with arrogance at every step.\u201d", "Author": "TravelSea", "ReviewID": "UR5951188", "Content": "This hotel is directly across the street from my office. I toured it shortly after its opening, and thought I'd stay someday as an in-city treat. What a mistake. I purchased the room at a charity auction. It was packaged with two tickets to the Seattle Symphony, and sold as \"attend the symphony and then stay at the W.\" When I got home and opened the envelope I purchased, I found that the symphony tickets were for Thursday performances; the W Hotel stay was for any Friday or Saturday night. At first I thought it was a mix-up by the charity, and frankly, it was for charity and I didn't really care. But after my experience with the arrogant, sloppy and just horrifically bad service at the W, I now wonder if the mistake was theirs. When I realized the room and tickets were incompatible, I decided to use the room as a surprise for the BF. I procured theatre tickets to a sold out show, and called the W to make a reservation. After being on hold for at least 10 minutes while the operator tried to \"figure it out,\" I was sent to the 800 number. The 800 operator was not exactly rude, but disinterested, uninformed, and generally oozed negative attitude. She, too, couldn't \"figure it out,\" and it literally took over 1/2 hour to make the reservation. When I made the reservation, I also told the operator that I wanted a corner room with a view and would pay whatever it took to upgrade to it. She assured me that I would have a corner room on a high floor with a view, and even after I offered THREE TIMES to pay for an upgrade, she told me (coldly and condescendingly (difficult to articulate)) that it would not be necessary and that I would get my request. You can see where this is going. When we arrived for check in, they gave us a corner room on the 5th floor in the back of the building, facing the wall of the Four Season's garage across an alley. When I spoke to the disinterested \"I'm too cool for my job\" desk clerk, the best I could get was a regular room on a somewhat higher floor, also in the back of the building, this time overlooking the same garage by about 10 feet. No apology, no real help, and attitude. By the way -- when I presented the 'bearer certificate' that I discussed with the reservation department for over 30 minutes earlier in the day, \"Mr. Hip\" had no idea what to do, called over an apparently more experienced version of himself, and the two of them took 20 minutes to, you guessed it, \"figure it out.\" Trying to keep a positive outlook, the BF and I decided to go to Earth and Ocean, the hotel restaurant. It was a busy Saturday night. We stood in a highly trafficked area and were ignored until I was able to stop the \"greeter,\" who told me they were no longer serving in the dining room, but we could order from a bar menu at the bar. Then he walked away. I mean, literally -- just walked away without additional comment, leaving us to figure out if we should seat ourselves, wait for someone else, or move into the lounge area. After a moment, we were able to stop another staff member who handed us two sticky bar menus while we were still standing in that odd, highly trafficked area, and I swear -- he, too, just walked away without comment. We left and went to a bistro down the street. The room was okay, albeit dark and facing the roof deck of the garage across the alley; the bathroom was dirty and well below five star standards. We left the next morning, and the portfolio read \"zero balance.\" While I was very disappointed with the attitude and service of the staff from beginning to end, thought the room was substandard, and had paid several hundred dollars for a \"package\" that was not a \"package,\" I thought I'd just let it go and remember that at least the charity made out well. Then, of course, I get my credit card bill. Yep, you guessed it. They charged me for the privilege of being ignored, condescended to, spending (between the two operators) over forty-five minutes to even make a reservation, and placing me in a substandard room with a dirty bathroom. I called them to correct the latest mistake in a series of mistakes, and after explaining the situation to someone in their reservation department, was forwarded to the guest services manager. I can't articulate the attitude well at all -- but at least it's consistent. Disinterested and arrogant is the best way to describe it. He told me that he would \"look into it,\" and call me back. Two days later I got a voicemail from him asking for the charity I purchased the room from, because he couldn't find the certificate. At this point, I was furious and didn't immediately return the call. About an hour later, he called again and told me he found the certificate and would be refunding the $230.00 charge to my card. The entire conversation took less than 30 seconds, and ended with a curt, perfunctory and insincere apology. Period. Wow... Just unbelievable. I don't see why anyone would want to stay here. The rooms are average at best, the bathroom was dirty, and the service was just \"too hip\" and arrogant to be anything but worthless. The location is good, poised strategically between the financial and retail districts downtown, but so are several other very fine hotels.

I had to be home within an hour to meet my SO and still had to secretly pack a bag with extra toothbrushes, PJs, etc. I was told they would work as hard as they could to get me a room quickly. In the meantime, I decided to arrange for a bottle of Champagne to be in my room upon arrival. I was ushered to the Conceirge, who basically could not have been less interested. When I asked her if she was certain they could have the bottle on ice in the room at 5:30pm, she looked at me as if I were from outer space. I should have known this was only a hint of things to come... Well, I was driving home to frantically pack, and then drive back to do the room key, then drive home to meet my SO -- yeah, I really like him so I go to this kind of trouble LOL -- when the guy at the desk called and said the room was ready. So I threw a few things in a bag and drove back downtown to get the key. Surprise! Another epic line. And people were yelling at the desk clerks and general mayhem was ensuing. Apparently, there was only ONE single bellhop for the entire hotel on a busy Saturday. Genius. Well, while waiting in line I told several people about tripadvisor.com so hopefully they will post here, too. I got to the desk, got my keys, and was running back out the door and said, \"You won't forget the Champagne, right?\" And they all smiled and said it was all set. One hour later, I arrived and told the SO that some friends had invited us up to their room for a pre-dinner drink. I entered room 2120 to find...no Champagne. I called downstairs in a wee bit of a rage and was told \"We knocked on the door but no one answered so we didn't want to come in and disturb anyone.\" I replied that no one had answered the door, because I wasn't in the room and since there was no Do Not Disturb sign on the door and since I had requested the bottle be waiting for my arrival, I was dismayed, mystified and peeved that they had blown the one most important element of the surprise overnight. Completely unacceptable at any price, but at $300+ it was ridiculous! They said they would have the bottle right up there and I said they were welcome to send it up if they would give me a break on the price, otherwise, forget it. She said she would do what she could. Which was, in a word, nothing. The bottle was delivered with a full price bill. I was insulted. I told the man that I was refusing the bottle and to take it back (it was unopened). He mumbled something and left the room without removing the bottle! I had to call down and ask for the bottle to be collected which it was. We ended up drinking the half-bottle from the mini-bar. After taking showers, we discovered there was only one bathrobe. I called down for one, and it was delivered quickly (albeit on a wire hanger...all the hangers in the closet were wood, so this looked tacky.) The room is nice, in fine shape, and the view was spectacular. I can say that much. At check-out the next day, the clerk was very apologetic and comped the half-bottle of Champagne when I told her of how completely unpleasant the experience had been. The W is very much form over function. I guess Seattle still doesn't have an interesting, cutting edge, non-dowdy, non-business-drone hotel.

First, I can't believe how low of a rating this hotel has received from reviewers on this site. I honestly think what may be happening is that this hotel is a little to hip for certain travelers. The W hotel is very nice. The staff is very professional and responsive to requests. At times I've even seen them walking the dogs of hotel guests. The bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. It has very high thread count sheets, a goose down comforter, a feather bed, and goose down pillows. Well I don't know how, but someone on this site managed to complain about that! The decor is definitely trendy. At all times there is house music playing in the lobby and bar area so if you like that genre then you will be right at home. During the evening they have candles burning and the bar area comes alive with people from all over Seattle. This is why you might want to stay there. To be honest, if I was staying at the Hilton I would probably go to the W just to hang out and mingle. It is definitely a cool spot to meet people. I'd say the age range is early thirties to late forties. For the guy complaining about the hotel charging for internet access, most hotels do charge a fee for that service. But if you are truly frugal, and it sounds like you are, then you should have used the FREE internet access in the lobby and bar area. That's what I did because I didn't want to pay either. The food at the hotel is a little expensive. An omelet delivered was $25 including service charges. Oatmeal costs about $13 delivered. Both were very good but I just couldn't justify the price, especially when there are so many restaurants nearby. To be sure, if you are more of a conservative person I would recommend you stay at the Hilton or Hyatt. Those hotels are more traditional. I'm actually a Hilton honors diamond member but after staying at the W, I will remain there for the rest of the month while I'm in Seattle. If you do decide to stay at the W, make sure you check out the great restaurant nearby called Jasmine. The food there is excellent and they also have a very nice vibe in their bar area.

There should be 2 firm pillows on each bed and 2 down pillows, which gives one a choice, thank God. The minibar was locked, very strange since we have been to five star hotels where they were not locked and did not need a key to get in, the hotel should figure out how to do that. The coordination between the front desk people was poor, we asked for 2 days to get an additional room, during our stay there and no one did anything, although promising to, we had to keep on top of it, it was quite disconcerting, no messages, no returned calls to our room...The concierge, a young man, directed us to Anthony's on the water downtown when we asked for a good seafood restaurant within walking distance. That place was pretty bad for a very expensive menu, the view was great but we would never eat there again. The concierge said their food was \"excellent\"...wrong! He really should be more informed, or fired. A list should be composed that lists all the best spots in town for food, drinks, dancing, shopping, etc...We had never been to Seattle before, and your information was non-existent!

He never asked if we wanted the tray in our room or in the hall, he would just rush past into our room where I was lying half asleep or naked, staring at me, yuck! This guy is unbelievable! Then if we would not answer his knock, he would disappear, with our tray, then we would have to call downstairs and get him to come back, then he would try to barge in again, where we had to keep the safety on the door to keep him out! He came with no coffee spoons, 1/2 the order, etc...Then we would have to call again, unbelievable...It seemed as if there was very little overseeing or organization in that kitchen! Then we actually went to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning and the coffee and juice came but no food. There were only 4 tables seated and it was around 8 AM. We waited and waited and finally the breakfasts came, hardly lukewarm. Eggs and potatoes should not be cold, they taste like grease and rubber. So then we sent the potatoes back and they came back in 10 minutes, after we had finished our eggs already, since we were starving for a few hours already. The kitchen is totally disorganized! The fact that you charge for an internet connection is truly offending! We are programmers and designers and cannot believe the mind that thought that one up!

We booked on-line about 4-weeks prior to the stay and got an on-line pre-pay special and got a rate that was close to or lower than many other big-chain hotels. We wanted to check out the hype about the W so booked here. What we got was a room similar to those we have paid much more for in places like Chicago Service is top-notch from the valet to the baggage staff - everyone worked hard to live up to their \"whatever/whenever\" promise. The Concierge helped us explore the city in our short stay with lots of suggestions for dining and shopping and a suggested walking tour. The W is located very centrally in the city - walking distance to Pikes Market and the Piers. The room was a corner room with a long entrance hallway that led to a huge (the booking said 430 sq. ft.) corner room that was beautifully appointed. We didn't hear a sound from any other room or the hall but did get a bit of street noise on the 6th floor. A wonderful king-size pillow-top mattress with soft, silky linens piled with 6(!) down pillows (no calls for extra pillows here!) A large work desk similar to a photo in an earlier review. The carpet was a super-soft dark chocolate brown. The honor-bar was stocked with the usual items along with the more unusual like a small travel umbrella (great idea for Seattle), computer cords, postcards and a CD - all at very reasonable prices for an honor bar. The room had a great corner view with lots of natural light, a small stereo with a great mix CD and a listing of local radio stations. We stayed as late as possible lounging in the plush robes, taking long showers using the Bliss products (face wash, too!) and snuggling in the comfy bed before check-out at noon. I would do the W in Seattle or any other city again if I got such a great rate. This is a great concept for a chain and the price was great. Next time maybe we'll go to one within driving distance so we can take our dog because I understand the pet service is outstanding.", "Date": "August 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, VA", "Title": "\u201cMy favorite place to stay in Seattle\u201d", "Author": "gleff", "ReviewID": "UR3634059", "Content": "I really do love this hotel and always have. It\u2019s my favorite place to stay in Seattle. I like the Sheraton, have a bit of love-hate with the Westin, but the W is my first choice. Upgrades: There are only about 8 suites here, half of which are smoking and one of which is \u2018accessible\u2019 so there aren\u2019t a lot of suite upgrade opportunities. But a Kool Korner room on a high floor has never been a problem. When I stayed in May 2005 there was a large conference booked over several days staying at the hotel, and they\u2019d wrapped up a bunch of the small number of suites that the hotel had. Plus Snoop Dogg was staying there. So I was in a Kool Korner room. I did notice a few areas of the room where form overtakes function. I didn\u2019t have enough drawers. 1/3 of the chest is taken up by the safe and it\u2019s only about half the size of the usual hotel chest. (Regular rooms seem to have more chest space, oddly enough.) Our first night at the hotel we had dinner at the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Earth & Ocean. It\u2019s much improved over two years ago. The chef is very creative with presentation and they offer very high quality meat and fish. The sweetbreads were a nice size with no sinew whatsoever. Despite the food, though, it\u2019s not a great restaurant, at least it wasn\u2019t on this occasion. Service lacked. Several times they dropped silverware by the table. I cringed when someone in the party asked for a Miller Lite and the waiter said \u201cI don\u2019t think so. But I\u2019ll check.\u201d with a roll of the eyes. He never returned to the subject (such as to followup and apologize for not having the first choice, and perhaps offer a suggested alternative). Ordered room service breakfast around 6:30, it arrived in 14 minutes. I had an excellent avocado, bacon, and cheese omellette. Truly delicious. The food at the W, from the restaurant to room service to banquet, is good across the board. For folks who haven\u2019t been there, it\u2019s a typical W: lighting is dark, \u2018hip\u2019 music plays in the lobby. There\u2019s a funky \u2018living room\u2019 in the lobby to relax in. The bar scene is trendy. Rooms are comfortable. The hotel aspires to be high-end in service, touting its \u2018Wherever/Whenever\u201d line (they\u2019ll handle any need you have) but this is no Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton. Hotel employees are mostly attractive twenty-somethings dressed in black, and not as well-trained in service as are staff at the high-end chains. If you want refined service, stay across the street at the Fairmont. The W is funky, fun, and for me comfortable. It\u2019s sometimes surprisingly inexpensive. TravelZoo sometimes promotes great deals, I\u2019ve seen it for as little as $139 there. It occasionally participates in Starwood\u2019s cash & points award program, which this year means 4000 Starwood points and $60 for a night. But without deals it can run $230 or more, even $289. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth twice the price of the nearby Sheraton.", "Date": "July 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sioux Falls, SD", "Title": "\u201cThe jury is still out on this one....\u201d", "Author": "leaderman", "ReviewID": "UR3619584", "Content": "I was excited to bring my wife to the W in Seattle as I thought it would be a perfect get-away from which to explore the downtown area.

One's pupils need not dilate in the W reception area....dark, dark, dark. At 2:00 p.m., all you see are candles and the reflection of the computer screens off the faces of the staff. Hmmm, interesting, I thought. Friendly folks - great \"welcome\" by the guys at the door, and in no time we were up to our room. I was ready for dark hallways, having read other reviews, but these are REALLY dark. Wow. Interesting. I kinda like it to be honest with you. Room - they call it \"spectacular\" but I might call it peculiar. Not very large by any stretch, a cool sofa in the window, some IKEA-looking furniture and there you have it. Did we feel a warmth from the room? No. Was the bed \"heavenly?\" Not if you compare it to the Westin down the road... Overall, the W is a cool place. Yuppies will love it.

The rooms are not large but they have their version of the \"Heavenly Bed\". All the room furnishings look great and even their stationary was impressive. The bathroom accessories are Bliss, which is supposed to be a boutique brand. The hallways are downright dark but I realize that's the nature of the hotel so I accept it. One thing that got on my nerves is the elevator \"ding\". It's very loud & I could hear it although I was in a corner room about as far away from the elevator as you could get. The W is a new hotel & that's why I chose it. The surrounding hotels are very old. I didn't eat here but the lounge and restaurant looked \"cool\". One BIG issue that I had was the valet parking. When you park, you're not allowed to self-park. Upon receiving my car when I was checking out, there was a large scratch. Ok, I filled out the claim form but I was visibly upset. The valet people kept telling me it would be ok, they'll take responsibility, and for me to \"go home\" and wait for their call. Well, I think it was just to get me out of their hair because I received a call a few days later from them disowning all responsibility.

The entire hotel is very stylish and fun. Our room was spacious and had a great view of the city. The linens & towels were great--soft, good quality. The bed was also really comfy. The only glitch that I can speak of occurred on our first night. We hung out in the bar and ordered an appetizer to snack on. Something in the kitchen got screwed up and our order (which was pretty simple) ended up taking over 30 mins to get to us. The bar staff was really apologetic about it. Later, we ordered a dessert to share--same story, kitchen problems. Long story short, the staff were very kind and seemed really embarassed about it. They comped us both the app and the dessert.

Our 4th floor view wasn\u2019t anything, but the windows (hidden by wooden shutters) opened. That\u2019s a real plus. Bathroom was spacious with plenty of towels and Aveda products.
