Location is indeed the value added point of this apartment. It's just opposite of Times Square. When it rains, all I had to do is to cross the street & in less than 10 meters, there is a door near the lift of the Food Forum. It's all indoor walking to the MTR station even though it requires a bit of walk. Room is fine and space is a luxurious item in HK. Room is just a standard size, I assume. Still we can cook simple food in the kitchen. There are two TVs. The one in the living room is good, the one in the bedroom is too small. In general, room is clean. Housekeeping staff is helpful. I noticed that reception staff in the 7th floor is working during working hours only. Other than that, there is only one person standing by. Free coffee and cookies are available at the reception office at 7th floor. There's computer & printer for guest use which is quite useful. Super City supermarket and food court are in the basement of Times Square. Walk a little bit & I arrived at supermarkets in Sogo and Wellkome which have more down to earth products with cheaper price. There are 3 restaurants in the building; 2 Japanese & 1 Korean. Different management. Food Forum in Times Square has many mid to high class restaurants. McDonald's is within walking distance. Washing machine and dryer are available in our floor for all guests. Iron & ironing board are available in the room. Good wifi connection.

The taxi took a while to find the place as it's hidden among the crowded area of Time square. We took the 1-bedroom (620-665 sq ft gross) and added an extra bed in the living area. Bed and cot was already in place when we arrived and cot even have pillow, bolster, blanket and bumpers. Quite a surprise as we do not even get that in some 5-stars hotel. Extra bed is firm and comfortable and not those springy makeshift type you get in hotels. We forgot to bring a portable high chair during this trip and tried our luck to ask for a high chair and they brought one to us almost immediately. They will provide dish washing solution if you request. One little issue we had was the unexplained cold draft in the bathroom. It was freezing cold in december and no matter how you closed the door or adjust the thermostat, it's still coming in. Not good if you have a young toddler and he basically shivering and crying after coming out of the shower. There seems to be heaters on loan but we didn't realize until we checked out. Kitchen is small but good enough to whip up small meals for my boy. There is 1 dryer and washer on every floor. Bring your detergent as it's not provided. We are on the 26th floor so no issues on noise level. Good location with Macdonalds and convenience shop next door, not to mention Times square with the city super supermarket. We managed to buy fish to cook for my little boy. There is also a food court in Time square with various types of cusine. I would certainly return to stay at this property again but not during winter unless i can get the bathroom warmed up.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cLocated bang in the middle of the shopping district\u201d", "Author": "Traveleator", "ReviewID": "UR121194551", "Content": "I stayed at Shama Causeway for a month in August because I was in HK for business. This property is located bang in the middle of the shopping district which has both pros and cons depending on the reason of your stay. The pros were that there are a plethora of restaurant, shops (jewellery and watches galore), a mall, cinema, food court & a supermarket all within a stone's throw. The taxi stand too is right outside the apartment building. There is an entrance to the MTR right opposite (but it's a 15 min walk to the actual train) and the trams are 5 mins walk away on the main road. The cons are the light and the noise. The serviced apartment is from the 8th storey to the 28th and on the topmost floor they have a wonderful terrace. The gym is on the 7th and though not big was never crowded. There are two restaurants within the building and a 24 hour McDonalds adjacent to it. They had a business centre on the 7th floor open to all guests. As the hotel is opposite Times Square most of the the rooms (6 out of 8) on my floor are facing bright neon lights way past mid-night and hence one has to draw the curtains to preserve privacy (Times Square has bubble lifts which allows people to have a complete view of your rooms) and to avoid the light from seeping in. This I believe is the biggest drawback and hence if you are booking here, do ask for units A or H if they're within your budget. The property has several room sizes from studio to 2 bedroom. Mine was a 1 bedroom sized 650 sq ft according to the staff, but seemed much smaller to me. The kitchenette along the passageway from the door into the hall which had an outsized sofa (10 feet long, along the length of an entire wall) that made the room look very cramped. The bedroom had a queen sized bed and one closet. The room was small and there was little room to walk around the bed. They provided an alarm and an ipod/iphone docking machine. There was a 40 odd inch flat screen tv and free internet/wireless in my room. The bathroom was clean, but the shower area was very small, barely 5-6 sq ft and almost everyday I banged my elbows in there. The common area outside the rooms was carpeted but because of a leaking a/c vent the place felt a bit damp. Each floor has a washing machine and a dryer for common use, you have to procure your own powder. I must say that during the booking due to some confusion I was allotted a smoking room and when the staff was informed they offered me another room and replaced even replaced my pillows. The security staff is very pleasant and always available on the ground floor. The lifts have securid and hence when flashed the lift will only go to the floor tagged to your key. In case you are carrying heavy luggage and will need help to carry it to your room please let the staff know 10-15 mins before you arrive. I'd recommend this hotel for families who are visiting HK for shopping, leisure and even for people on business who don't mind a bit of din and liveliness. I must say that I visited another serviced apartment in Midlands (not Shama's) and I found that the rooms were much bigger for the same price.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cIts better to book a one bedroom suite\u201d", "Author": "dewichen", "ReviewID": "UR120894108", "Content": "I stayed at a studio suite which can't compare to my my friend's one bedroom suite.

We had a few problems from the moment we checked in. There were four of us, and since them ran out of 2 bedroom apartments, I had requested 2 of the 1 bedrooms to be on the same floor. They were unable to accomodate that request, and it was a huge hassle since they had different security keys for each floor in the elevator. So visiting the other half of the family on a different floor was inconvenient. Also, the staff that checked us in were not that friendly or knowledgeable. We couldn't get the Wifi to work, and they couldn't help us. After that though, we found the rooms themselves to be well decorated and very clean. The kitchens were too small to do any real cooking, but enough to reheat something or boil water. I was able to use the gym which was nice although the people going up the elevators in Times Square Food Forum get a clear view of your workout. The washer and dyer on each floor was also extremely helpful and nice that they were free. I thought the location of Shama Causeway Bay could not be beat, since the restaurants and City Super were across the street, and MTR was only 2 blocks away. All the surrounding shops and food outlets were also convenient. So overall, for the value I think it was worth it.

The Shama Central and the Shama Causeway Bay are the only ones currently rented on a daily basis in HK \u2013 the others are for long-stay only. We stayed in one of the smaller one-bedroom units during the Xmas holidays. We made the reservation by phone from the U.S. with their English-speaking HK office. They emailed a reservation confirmation. The rate they quote covered everything \u2013 no tax, service charge or internet fees on top of that. The only extra charges are for additional persons in the room. Our one-bedroom was rated for 2 occupants. Since we had our son with us, they said they would charge an additional HK$100 (about US$13) per day for extra towel, pillow and duvet for him to sleep on the sofa, but in the end they did not charge us. (The sofa was not a sofa-bed.) A roll-away bed would have been HK$200/day. This apartment was located right on the Times Square plaza, one of the busiest shopping locales in Hong Kong. I believe all the Shama apartment units look out over Times Square. The Shama was located right across from the taxi queue. When you arrive, call ahead so the apartment will send a porter to help get your luggage. The nearest MTR station was about 4 blocks away. There was a roof-top terrace which looked directly down on the plaza. The terrace had a quiet atmosphere with padded recliners and potted plants. There were two barbecues. The terrace can be rented for parties. The apartment building was newish-looking; the Shama web site photos of the building and units were accurate. The office was on the seventh floor (8th floor by U.S. standards, as the first floor was the \u201cground\u201d floor) and was manned 24-7. The staff was calm, extremely friendly and had a desire-to-please attitude; they handed out their personal business cards with direct phone number. Every staff person we ran into, in the elevator or hallway, would greet us as if we were a family friend. The office had two Mac computers for guest use and a printer. Free cookies were laid out and a Nespresso espresso machine with a free selection of regular and decaff coffee pods was available in the office all the time. They don't mind if you bring the coffee cup from your room to take back a double espresso. There was a small fitness center next to the office. Since the number \u201c4\u201d is unlucky in Chinese, there was no 4th, 14th or 24th floor \u2013 but there was a 13th floor! Our unit had a tiny kitchenette with black glass-topped electric stove, microwave, under-counter refrigerator with freezer compartment, hot water boiler, toaster, pots, plates, glasses, utensils, chef knives and even a Shama cookbook. There were single-serve instant coffee packets (no drip coffee, but you can buy single-serve drip packets at the grocery store across the street), a selection of tea bags and some \u201cdigestive\u201d crackers. Two bottles of water were set out on arrival and replenished by the daily maid service. Despite what the website said, there was daily maid service even on holidays. The windows were not operable. I believe there were no non-smoking rooms but our room had no residual stale smoke odor. In fact, during our entire stay we never saw (or smelled) anyone smoking in or around the apartment building. It was also very quiet. We never heard any noise from the unit above, or next door. Street noise was attenuated except for the amplified New Year\u2019s festivities. Furniture was of medium quality, not new but in good condition. A sliding partition separated the bedroom from the living room. The bed was equivalent to an American king size. The mattress was hard but not unreasonable. The linens/duvet were white high-quality finely-woven cottons now found at all high-end hotels. There was a small dining table with two chairs and a bench. Lighting was plentiful, with dimmable lights in the bedroom and living room. The bedroom had a large closet with plenty of hangers and a sideboard with drawers and storage areas. Two bedstands also had drawers. A small electronic safe would accommodate a couple 15 inch laptops and paper files. There was an iron and hair-dryer. In the entry way for the apartment there was a large storage closet for hanging coats that had shoe shelves on the bottom and large shelves on top that would acommodate 4 standard 22\u201d roll-aboard suitcases. If you have more luggage, we were told there was a storage closet on each floor where you can store larger suitcases. The bathroom was tiled with a marble-top counter. It was clean, but didn\u2019t have that antiseptic, hospital-clean feeling that you get in some hotels. The sink counter had no drawers but there were storage cubbies next to the mirror. Toiletries were high-quality Bulgari shampoo, conditioner, lotion and shower gel. There was a large shower stall (no bathtub) with a standard shower head. As is standard in Hong Kong apartments, there was a switch (on the lighting switchplate) for the water heater which you need to remember to turn on a few (2-5) minutes beforehand or just leave it on all the time. There was a standard 110 volt \u2013 220 volt electric shaver outlet that took U.S. and European two-prong plugs. This apartment came with a 32-inch Hitachi flat panel TV and a Phillips DVD player that played US region-1 (USA) DVDs that we brought from home as well as local region-2 DVDs. English-language TV stations included CNN, BBC, CineMax, HBO, ESPN, Cartoon Network and Discovery. There was a small Bose stereo audio system that we didn\u2019t use. In the bedroom was a small stereo with iPod dock. There was no TV in the bedroom. Shama shrewdly anticipated that guests would use the dining table as an office desk, so the wall next to it had two electric outlets plus (and I\u2019ve never seen this anywhere else except another Shama) a 4-outlet power strip, in addition to the LAN high-speed network cable. All outlets were Hong Kong 3-prong UK-style, so you\u2019ll need adapters and convertors for appliances that don\u2019t take the 220 volts (Shama provided one adapter that accommodated US two-prong plugs on the power strip). Shama also provided a secured wireless network \u2013 each apartment had its own access code. Both the wired and wireless internet worked great. There was a cordless phone in the bedroom. Local calls were free -- which means calls anywhere in Hong Kong. The room came with a direct-dial phone number that you can give out so others can call you directly at your apartment. A voicemail system took a message if you\u2019re not there. In addition to expensive laundry/dry cleaning service like you get at hotels, the Shama had a self-service laundry room on each floor with a washer and dryer. These were free; you only needed to provide your own detergent. There\u2019s no hotel restaurant or room service. There were restaurants on the lower floors of the building and a McDonald\u2019s next door. The Ootoya restaurant on the 3rd floor had good Japanese cooked food (not sushi) such as bento sets and donburis for about HK$700-900. There was a City Super grocery store in the basement of the Times Square building across the street. Turning right going out the building, the local market was about 2 blocks away with live fish, flowers, cheap restaurants and a lot of local color. In summary, we thought the Shama Causeway Bay was an inexpensive, comfortable and roomy alternative to a hotel, particularly for a family, in a great location.

There is a small electric kitchen, complete with all the utensils, glass, etc if you want to cook. reception lounge where you can check internet if you dont bring your computer, read newspaper or magazines, get a complimentary coffee, biscuits, etc its just like a mini lounge. They dont have their own gym, but in return they partner up with california fitness which is pretty good. There is also a rooftop access if you want to enjoy more city or apartment views from the above. The entire place is also secured and each floor activated by key card only. The only complaint I had was late delivery of laundry which is pretty expensive and having me going back and pick it up again. But all and all it's a pretty decent place to stay, will definitely come back!", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!

A little bit of warning though, some cab drivers don\u2019t know where it is, we even took the map provided by the hotel and showed it, either the driver can\u2019t read (it has both English and Chinese characters) or he is just to lazy to think, because he kept on insisting that we get off at the Holiday Inn Express, it wasn\u2019t until the doorman at the Holiday Inn Express explained to him that there was another hotel across Time Square that he decided to drive us around the front. Location: It\u2019s right in front of Times Square, I like that it has everything within a 5-10 minute walking radius, but hate the long walk to the MTR station. Check-in: The staff was great but the really stick by their 2pm check in time. We took the 8am flight from Manila and was in HK around 9:30 and was in the HK Station at around 1030am. Since we got 3 1-bedroom units we were hoping that at least one was available so we could drop out stuff and the two kids could rest a bit before heading out to lunch. Unfortunately we were told that we have to wait until 2pm to check in but we can leave the stuff at their office. Room: The room was big, but the actual bedroom and the small TV in it could be bigger. Weird huh? The living room was very spacious with a couch, a day bed, a dinning table with a bench and chairs, but the bedroom only had about a foot or two around the bed, which made it a bit hard to move around. My brother and I settled with just leaving our bags outside on the living room floor. Bathroom: is big, but pretty standard, there is a switch for the heater which I didn\u2019t know about so I took my first shower in icy cold water. Oh they also provided nice Bulgari toiletries. Bed: Bed was very comfortable not really too soft and not hard either, but the pillows were too soft, I had to use some throw pillows to support my head while sleeping. Breakfast: It\u2019s a serviced apartment so there was no breakfast but McDonalds is just right beside it. You could also buy stuff from City Super next door at Times Square and cook it at your little kitchen in the room. Check-out: Since it was a Sunday I guess they had fewer staff in the office, in fact there was only one guy, it the check out was still fast and efficient, he just handed me the printed bill and the charge slip for the incidentals. By the way they don\u2019t (or won\u2019t) help you get a cab, it was a good thing no one was in line at the taxi stand in front of Times Square. Overall Evaluation: I wouldn\u2019t mind staying there again, in fact I just might stay there when I go back this April. I\u2019m just not that happy about the long walk to the MTR, compared to Park Lane where we usually stay.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "jakarta", "Title": "\u201cNext Stay in Hong Kong : Shama\u201d", "Author": "rwintour", "ReviewID": "UR56544534", "Content": "I know this Service Apartment during my last trip to Hong Kong in December 2009; the Location is EXCELLENT ... the times square bld is just your opposite neighbour and 5 minutes walk to Sogo in Causeway bay....excellent excellent location!", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and value for money\u201d", "Author": "kuos", "ReviewID": "UR54712294", "Content": "I traveled to HK often and Shama Causeway bay is definitely good value for your money-However there are a few annoying points i must mention: --Poor sound proof system--I stayed at a Studio apartment near the management office (7A) and can hear all kind of noise early in the morning--furnatures being moved around, the cleaing crew, etc....I dont know if a higher up floor would be better but if you were given a choice do not stay in 7A --Manager Connie was definitely not professional in greeting guests--while other staff were all very friendly and helpful, upon my arrival Connie was rude when checking me in, not making eye contact and seem like she is too busy to help her customer.

Must say that I was quietly impressed by the efficiency and friendliness of the establishment ranging from the Manager Randy and his staff esp the concierge (sorry but cant remember his name). The room was spacious and plesantly decored and the bathroom was decked out with Bvlgari bottles of liquid soap, shampoo, conditioner etc. The price of the service apartment was a tad high compared to the others my family stayed at other countries but I guess the location and the room more than made up to it. A nice touch was that they rented out movies and for visitors with young kids, we could rent out a PSP at no extra charge. The cleanling of the room was great and when we got back from a hard days of sightseeing and shopping, it was comforting to come back to a clean room. Only thing that I can hope that the service can look into is to replenish the complementary stock of tea and coffee (didnt have any from the first day we checked in). Also the pillows were, to me anyways, were too soft for my liking. There are laundry faciities but we didnt use it as we just bought new clothes! Shopping was simply great even for a jaded Singaporean shopper! The location was great in that Times Square Mall was just opposite the establishment. You would never run out of food! Times Square Mall had an impressive suite of restaurants on the 7th floor and a food court at very inexpensive prices at the basement. You can buy a full sushi tray at the basement for HKD64 (SGD12) or a very filling Indian takeaway for just HKD50 (SGD9). The usual fast food joints like MacD, KFC and Starbucks is just a hop step and jump away from the apartment's doorsteps. However if you want to try the smaller establishments, you just have to walk towards the lights at the top of the Russell Street where there are a myriad of small restaurants. We went to one and had beef tongue curry and baked rice! Delicious! Location is extremely conveient for its proximity to the Causeway Bay MTR station. From there, we had no problems to get to Ocean Park, Disneyland and even City Plaza Mall at Taikoo station When we got to HK, we took the Airline Express Train to the Hong Kong Central Station. The cost of the tickets was reduced to HKD 250 from the usual HKD400 (HKD100 per person) due to the fact that we bought 4 tickets. We took a cab from the station to Shama that cost us HKD40. If you're thinking of taking the cab, my suggestion is to avoid them as much as possible and take the MTR. Might be a bit inconvenient but it more than worth it because the traffic on Hong Kong island is heavy at peak hours. When we were to go the airport to return home, the concierge told us that it was cheaper that we went by taxi as there were 4 of us! If we were to book early, the cost would be HKD260 but we had to take a regular cab. I decided to take the cab cause it would cost us HKD400 (no concession for group tickets this time) and the thought of 2 young boys and three heavy laden bags did not appeal to me! We took the cab and the trip was about 30 minutes and it cost us HKD320! Like to thank the concierge, a bespectacled Chinese gentleman, for the recommendation. All in all, it was a great experience and my family enjoyed our stay there. 2 thumbs up!", "Date": "December 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cAwesome\u201d", "Author": "dahappyone", "ReviewID": "UR49078442", "Content": "I have stayed in a lot of hotels in Hong Kong ranging from mid to high end and Shama causeway bay is definitely one of the best I have stayed in when you consider their location, price, and the size of their rooms. Shama is more of a service apartment hotel so it would be an even better choice if you were staying for long periods. Its situated right opposite of times square where there is shopping, food, nightlife, and the taxis and the mtr's are just right infront of you when you walk out. There rooms are huge comparitively in Hong Kong and very clean tidy and very up to date, I especially liked their bose sound system. Their customer service is great, the counter clerk was very friendly and when i had trouble with my internet connection which was complimentary, a service guy was there to solve the problem. The prices for the rooms are not cheap but very good value for the money, remember because of the service apartment 'style', the price includes the extra 10% for service which most hotels in Hong Kong charge. The only thing you have to consider is that they collect the payment for the whole stay at check in instead of check out but their 48 hrs cancellation policy is very fair.

The bathroom, living area and bedroom were also very spacious, something larger-built Westerners would surely appreciate. There were also nice thoughtful touches provided, such as Bulgari toiletries, good quality bedroom slippers (which a lot of 5-star hotels compromise on), similarly good quality bed and linen, and even a Bose sound system. There is also free cable tv and broadband, and even an iPod station by the bed. Another thing worth mentioning is the location - the Causeway Bay Shama is smack in the middle of the action, right opposite Times Square/Lane Crawford, which also houses a City Super supermarket. The MTR is also directly opposite, and there are plenty of dining options within spitting distance, even in the building Shama is in as well. The best part of this is that the promotional offer for all this was only US$145/night all inclusive - with a studio apt option costing less even.
