The only positive thing I have to say about the Capital Square Hotel is that its location is good. Other than that there really isn't much to recommend it. The hotel is shabby and run-down. There seems no obvious attempt by the owners/management to undertake regular maintenance that would make it a pleasant budget-priced hotel to stay in. We stayed here four to five years ago and the overall condition of the hotel has deteriorated. Housekeeping is sub-standard. We were supplied with dirty towels, and our rooms weren't cleaned properly - we found items from the previous occupants on the floor of our room. One day we came back to our room late in the afternoon & it wasn't made up. When I complained about this I was told that the rooms of guests already checked into the hotel weren't cleaned until after 2pm. While I understand there is a focus on readying rooms for incoming guests, I've never come back to a room after 4pm, while staying at other hotels, to find it unmade. The reception staff are either not trained or under-trained and treat hotel guests with disdain & disrespect. I was lied to on several occasions by the reception staff in relation to room-related issues requiring attention - including what was being done to address the issues & the whereabouts of the manager. We had to move rooms twice due in response to problems with them. The first room we were checked into was full of mosquitoes, the second room we were placed in was on George Street and extremely noisy. While we were offered a discount on one nights stay, even this was problematic as the staff member didn't apply it correctly the first time, another refund had to be issued and the discount applied again. Even on leaving, the lack of care about customer service and experience was apparent. We asked to check our bags at reception while we collected our rental car, a short 15 min walk away. We were told it would cost $2.00 per bag. Overall, it was not a pleasant stay and we were glad to leave. As I said earlier, staying in budget accommodation doesn't have to be a disappointing experience. However, staying at Capital Square Hotel was.

The room was clean and decent(though when we first entered, it was abit smelly and stuffy but once you turn on the air con, its fine). The bathroom include shampoo, body wash and hair dryer.

In fact, this hotel is located right in the heart of the thai precinct, which means you have great (and cheap) thai restaurants right outside your door.

So every time I wanted to get back up to my room, I had to go to reception for someone to unlock the door.

Of course the hotel is on the light rail route as it winds its way down from above Eddy Avenue at Central Station. I walked around the block for five minutes before finally finding its entrance. I have been to more than 30 countries and rarely have this difficulty when walking to a hotel, so perhaps he or she has not done so in the months since we stayed, the hotel's manager needs to obtain a permit from the City of Sydney and install a more easily locatable sign on the street.

With a rate of $99 for a Sunday night stay in Sydney, Capitol Square Hotel appeared to fit the bill for this, so I was happy to book through the Rydges.com website. Upon my arrival at the hotel late on the Sunday evening, the reception was attended by two staff members, one of whom was on the phone, the other simply looked up at me blankly and said \"check in with what name?\" I mean come on, it takes only a few seconds more to actually say hello and actually get to know your guest, so I was rightly annoyed at this lack of courtesy. The same staff member then thrust a registration card at me and simply said \"can i have your credit card so I can take an imprint\". Why bother employing staff when they do not actually bother to get to know their guests? I was allocated a room on the 5th floor of the hotel, and told by the staff member that this was \"the good floor to be on\", well if this was the good floor I would really hate to see the other ones! The room had splotchy marks all over the carpets, dented old furniture and to make things even worse the bathroom was literally the size of a closet and did not have any towels at all! So I had to call back downstairs to reception to ask for some towels to be sent up to my room. I called twice and on both occasions the number simply rang out, on the third attempt my request was finally answered by a staff member who treated my call with contempt and merely stated that they would \"bring them up when they got a moment\", I mean I am a paying guest, surely my concerns are a priority. Checking out early on Monday morning was certainly very fast, I arrived at the reception desk and said that I was checking out, the staff member merely said back to me \"what room\" and then proceeded to check me out without even a moments pause. My request to speak to someone about my stay merely yielded a response of \"the manager will not be here until 9am and I can't help you\", I have stayed at many different hotels in Sydney and elsewhere, and this is the first time that I have actually been told that my opinion is worthless. This hotel has a great location at the heart of the entertainment district with Darling Harbour nearby. However the service here is simply appalling and definately not up to the standards of a Rydges property.

The place wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too noisy, and the location is fantastic, a short 5 minute walk to central station and heaps of shops, restaurants etc. The bathroom and room were clean, apart from the doona cover which had urine stains and the carpet which had a large orange stain (not that the carpet matters). However, it was the poor service we received when we arrived that turned us off. I was called the day before the booking and informed that there was an error with wotif.com; the website kept taking bookings even though they were full, so they were now overbooked. The lady was very nice, and explained that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d arranged accommodation for us across the road at the Metro, which has the same star-rating and amenities and would be the same price. For the inconvenience, Capitol would throw in a complimentary breakfast, too. We arrived at the Metro and waited in line a while, and when we got to the desk the staff couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find our booking. About ten minutes was spent waiting in line and then waiting for the staff to go through the system to find us, checking with other staff, etc. Then we were told they needed to call the Capitol, because they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find our booking. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t too happy about all the waiting as we had a tight turnaround time before we had to leave for our concert, and we were hoping to get a nanna nap in before we left. We waited another ten minutes while the Metro staff tried for a while to get through to the Captitol (either the phone was busy or no-one was answering) but we were finally told that the Capitol DID have a room for us. Now that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconvenience: waiting in line when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re tired, hungry and thirsty for no reason whatsoever. We got to Capitol and waited in line some more. We overheard the clerk say to the customers in front of us as they left for their room, that they were in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd side of the hotel, meaning away from the street and the roadworks. How unprofessional to say that at all -admitting that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good and bad side to a hotel when you pay the same rate- and worse, in front of other customers!? We were given our room key and I asked if breakfast was still included; in my opinion we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been stuffed around more waiting across the road unnecessarily than we would have been if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d actually checked in to the Metro. The clerk checked our paperwork and said that our booking didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include it. I explained that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been told we were now getting complimentary breakfast, to which the manager told the clerk right in front of us (we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t important enough to be acknowledged) that no, our booking didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come with breakfast, and we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t supposed to go to the Metro at all (as if it was our fault we went there). We were told to go to the Metro by Capitol, but they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t admit their mistake nor make good on their conciliation for the hassle. Annoyed, I pointed out that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d wasted our time, about half an hour (meaning no nap). Indirectly, the clerk then accused us of lying, by checking his watch and saying it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d only been ten minutes since he received the phone call from the Metro. Again, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to grasp the fact that it was their fault we were waiting 20 minutes at the Metro, not the Metros or ours. The Capitol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the issue made us feel completely undervalued; a free breakfast is nothing compared to the loss of repeat business from people who stay in Sydney CBD regularly.

Upon arrival we were asked to deposit $50 for 10 days which we weren't aware of (we booked throu Expedia.com.au and no such info was available). The room was small which we didnt mind. The floor boards throughout the room made noise everytime you walked. The bed cover was faded ad had many stains and a few holes. The beds are certainly not comfortable. One major issue we had was the Air Conditioning unit in the room was blowing cold air in the middle of the night. Breakfast is quite simple and not worth $10. One thing that we were quite annoyed about was the fact that the hotel is dirty by anyone's standard. The towels are well used and in need of replacement. In my opinion the hotel is not a 3 star hotel. The hotel has vending machines for alcohol, bevereges,snacks, toothbrushes, etc... so you cannot really say that this is a hotel, it had a hostel feel to it. I was aware that the hotel went through a soft refurbishing but I think soft refurbishing meant that they changed the carpet only. Location is not very good, it takes over 10 mins to walk to central station or the Town Hall station. The hotel is not too far to Darling Harbour which seems to be the only positive side of the hotel. Being on a main street, it is very noisy at nights, there is a bar/pub downstairs which adds to the street noise! There are also restaurants on the other side of the hotel and you can definitely hear the noise when you are n the hallways. I suggest to shop around for a hotel in sydney, this hotel is too expensive for $95-$115 a night for 2, mainly because it is a run down hotel, uncomfortable and lacks the wow factor. Hotels around the Central Station are cheaper and in better condition, although it feels that they are not really in town but are only seconds from the central station which means that for a day ticket you can go pretty much every where in town faster and with less walking.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bracknell", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel within easy reach of Darling Harbour\u201d", "Author": "JoFromBracknell", "ReviewID": "UR7402782", "Content": "Good hotel for a base within walking distance of Chinatown and Darling Harbour.

The cleaning staff were even friendlier than the reception staff greeting you with a 'hello ..how are you' every time you bumped into them in the hallways, a nice gesture i thought.

I stayed at this hotel as a conference-recommended hotel and it seems like a fine choice for a budget traveler. In response to one of the previous reviews, yes the TV seems to be reception-only (no cable or sat TV) but there were a number of stations and as a US-expat living in Asia I enjoyed watching Letterman and USA morning shows at the wee hours of the morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so the reception and channels were fine enough. The location is pretty good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can easily walk to places like Darling Harbour and Hyde Park (both about 15 mins walk away). There were many and frequent buses right out at the street that take you directly down to Circular Quay (5 min bus ride). There are a ton of restaurants in the area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially if you crave Asian food (there are plenty of non-Asian choices also). There is a major grocery store 2 blocks away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and keeping yourself well-stocked was no problem and very convenient. I was not a fan of the breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the choice is somewhat limited. Although the setting is bright and cool, I only ate breakfast there as it was a convenience on working days. The young staff was very friendly and helpful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and after so many days I had a lot of contact with them. One downside was that some guests seemed to attempt smoking in their rooms (which is not allowed) and set off the fire alarm - - this happen at least twice and having to evacuate is not a pleasant experience.
