Think rooms more on par with EconoLodge or Motel 8. I checked in to a room with cheap, 20-year-old looking, K-Mart-like furnishings (i.e., pressed plywood closets and desk). Although there was nothing overtly unclean in the room, it just didn't have that feel or look of being sanitary. I actually had to be switched to a different room because my heating system was not in working order...I should have dealt with the cold because I was moved to a room that wreaked of mold. The hotel staff told me that there were no other rooms available. So, I had to endure stench that filled the entire room. The bathroom walls were cracked, had holes in them. I actually showered with my cloth slippers on because I didn't know what I might contract from stepping on the shower floor with my bare foot. Oh, and speaking of shower, the shower \"wall\", which was a flimsy piece of think plastic, fell apart from the pressure of the showerhead's water hitting it. There are some positives - proximity to the Ciampino airport and restaurant on site that serves descent food. If you only have 1 night in Rome and need to stay near the airport, then take your chances here. If you have a longer stay, however, I would suggest staying in the city. You'll find much better accomodations for similar rates. There is no direct public transportation from the airport to the city and cabs are very expensive. But, you can take the SIT bus from Rome directly to the airport for 6 Euro and it runs every 30 minutes. You can also take the subway to the Anangnina stop (last stop on the red line) and then cab it to the airport which is 4 KM from the metro stop.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cnot bad for an airport hotel\u201d", "Author": "shaz1980", "ReviewID": "UR118747770", "Content": "I stayed here with friends the night before our flight back home from Rome.

For staff working in Ciampino, you would think they would know how to get to the train station and give you directions when driving by car. Instead, they were pushing you to use their shuttle service, which is provided for a fee. And does not have a schedule. The rooms are very outdated and would be equivalent to a 1star motel in Canada. There was only a very thin bed sheet between yourself and the mattress, and you can see the colour of the mattress coming through. The room smelled of bleach and cigarettes. The shower floor was dirty. I would not recommend this hotel, unless you just need a place to sleep to catch an early flight. We paid 85 euros for one night, in my opinion, it should only cost 50 euros or less a night. Do not stay here, if you're considering this as your homebase for visiting Rome. It is not conveniently located and you will need to take their shuttle service or taxi to the train station.

So EVERYTHING in the halls echo into the rooms, talking, running, children playing, people arriving/departing. If you are a light sleeper and have a room by reception you will not sleep.

Some rooms are very far off from the reception (more than 150m away). You'll have to take a long walk to get to your room. Location was BAD. Takes 1 hour to go the airport with 1 transfer. Bus to metro or Bus to train. Bus services not that frequent and bus timetable not fully updated. Some of the buses from Rome are EXPRESS services that go directly to the airport and do not pass by the hotel. As such, the last bus from the metro to the hotel is 8pm. NOT 11pm.

When we arrived, exited the airport and proceeded to the WHITE Taxies. If we would have known that we could have taken a BUS in the direction to the Anagnina Metro (line A) for only 1euro each to the hotel, which is literally about a 2 min bus ride, we would have opted for that, however we were never told about this option until we got to the hotel. You just ask for the bus to the metro station and show the bus driver the address to the hotel and ask him to let you know when its there and to stop. Since we didn\u2019t know, we had to take a taxi. This is where the problems started. We entered a WHITE Taxi. As the driver pulled away we asked how much. BIG MISTAKE. #1 always ask price before getting in taxi #2 ask the driver if he/she will give you a receipt. If they wont give you a receipt, chances are they are pocketing the EXTRA euros they try to swindle out of you. Ok so back to our little adventure. So the driver said, you speak English, we said yes. He pulled out a map showing the center of ROME and said it will be 30 euro. I said NO WAY, we are going 2 min away to the hotel and there is NO WAY we will pay 30 Euros and to stop the car and let us out. He would Not. Then he started to argue and then said ok, ok, ok 25 euros. I then said I will not pay more then 15 euros and demanded him to stop. He would not. well since the hotel is so close to the airport we were there before our argument ended. He then said he deserves 30euros because he lifted our one bag into his trunk of the car. I said I am only paying 15 euros. I handed him a 20 euros, he took it and was going to leave and I said, please give me my 5 euros now, and he said he did not have any. and then I demanded and he pulled out a hand full of coins adding up to about 4 euros and said that is all he had. I took it and then entered the hotel to report the cab number 2024. The hotel tried to call someone to report the driver but could not get anyone. Anyways long story short about a taxi drivers there, they are swindlers and try to milk you dry if you do not know, but hey this might be else ware but I don\u2019t know. Now, for the Hotel. We entered the door through the BAR, since there was no posting we could see for the front door. The staff was nice at the front desk, and sympathetic to our bad experience with the WHITE Taxi. We were given a room in the 600's, BAD MISTAKE. It took us 5 min. to walk to the room. At first as we were walking down the 100s the hallways were air-conditioned and looked as if it was just remodeled and we were please with the look. As we were walking down the hall we said, \u201cwow, very nice.\u201d Ok well here is the kicker, after you exit the 100's and proceed to the rest of the MOTEL its OLD all the other hallways look like an old MENTAL HOSPITAL, with the drab looking walls, very little light and very hot. The floor is made from turquoise/blue tile. When we got to the room it smelled so bad from people smoking in the room, so we immediately closed the door. I asked my friend to wait outside the room with our bag and then I hiked back to the front desk to ask for another room. The staff accommodated us and put us in room 210. As we entered the room, there were 4 single beds in what looked as if it was directly out of a \u201cyouth hostel\u201d. Very plain, no art on the drab-yellow walls that had some stain marks. The $9 lamp was from Ikea. The TV was super small and looked as it was from the 90s. The shower was a bit small, and the water seemed as if someone dropped an Alka-Seltzer tablet (you know one of the plop plop phiz phiz oh what a relief it is tablets) in the water or something, and tasted like it had some kind of minerals in it. It felt as if we were taking a shower in a carbonated water, shower fizzing all over us. Brushing our teeth felt equally strange, as this Alka-Seltzer water was making our mouth foam even more, and the taste was awful. No this was not SOFT WATER, it was something else, maybe someone reading this can let us know what it was, since at our other hotel outside of Venice had normal water. No free internet access in the room, however I think in the lobby there were 4 computer that could be used. There was a free continental breakfast, however it started at 7am and well most of the morning flights are at or before 7am so we are not able review that lavish display. Now, when we tried to check out in the morning, the computer system was not working or something (so the guy at the counter said \u2013 hmm looked to me the computer was working fine he just did not know how to use it I think). It seemed as if this was the counter guys first day/night on the job. He didn\u2019t know were anything was and spent 20 min. trying to figure it out. Eventually I said \u201cjust make a copy of my receipt, showing I paid\u201d and then he let us go to the airport so we not miss our flight. We opted to take the hotel shuttle, that starts at 5am in the morning, for 8-euros provided by the hotel, which we found out this was another option to get to the train station or Airport. All and all, just remember its best to use the public transportation, the bus that goes to the ANAGNINA METRO(Line A) is the best transport to and from the hotel. This is the metro that will take you into the city. Get a day pass from the machine for the Metro to see the sights. I would stay again at the hotel if we had a morning flight, because of how close it is to the airport, but would demand a room in the 100s, for the many reasons mentioned above and also because the barking of the guard dogs that are trained outside the hotel is a bit annoying at night. Once again the plus side to the stay was the friendly staff when we first arrived and the location of how close it is to the airport, in fact you can see the RyanAir jet outside the window if you look hard enough. In America this would be no more then a 2 star. So if your looking for anything better then an motel 6/8, this is not the place for you. If you\u2019re just going to use it as a place to sleep for the night to get an early flight, with very little to no amenities, Alka-Seltzer water for the shower, drab, hot, mental hospital interior, then this is the place for you. ENJOY. PS one tip if your going to see the Coliseum, you will be HOUNDED when you exit the metro to go on a special tour, where you don\u2019t have to wait in the 1 hour + in line to get tickets. Well here is the KEY to not waiting in line for tickets to the Coliseum that they wont tell you because they just want your euros. If you are facing the entrance to the Coliseum, turn around and you will see the ruins, and then you will see a path up to the ruins. Go up the hill where you will find the entrance for the ruins are and you will see a ticket booth left hand side. This ticket gets you in both, it\u2019s the same price and you wont have to wait in line, like everyone else is at the Coliseum. When you go back to the Coliseum entrance make sure you are in the LEFT line, because the Right line is for those that need to purchase tickets.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex, England", "Title": "\u201cbetter than it looked\u201d", "Author": "Emmandkay", "ReviewID": "UR7638240", "Content": "We used the Palacavicchi for an o'night stay, to catch an early flight from Ciampino.

Eight of us (4 Couples) have just spent a five day holiday staying at the Hotel Palacavicchi at Ciampino, Rome. Location about 3/4 Mile from Ciampino and about the same distance from the airport. Regular Public Buses each way mean easy transfers for only 1 Euro , in addition the hotel has a Shuttlebus. To acess Rome take a train from Ciampino Station to the Termini (only 1.30 Euro) which means you can travel from a low price hotel to the Centre of Rome for only 2.30 Euro. Accomodation (We paid 340 Euro's for 4 Nights B & B per couple) :- Excellent Quality and Very Clean , Fresh Towells Daily and rooms cleaned meticulously. (When you arrive the lavatory has a seal on it.) Room is freshened up and cleaned daily as well. Decor is good. (Small problem arose with one of the groups bedrooms having plumbing difficulties , Hotel acted immediately and re allocated them another room. ) Room had air conditioing and double glazing. We all agreed aircraft noise WASNT a problem and we all slept well (Probably due to the Red Wine - but hey - we were on holiday!) Facilities , Bar, Restaurant, Computer Section & Function Room, all tastefully decorated. Bar Prices were Great !!! Bottle of House wine only 7 euros' , Large Peroni Beers 660ml only 3 Euros and Pizza's started at 3.50 Euro. Menu had a large choice of Meat Poultry and Fish. (The best barometer was the large number of locals eating and entertaining here - obviously they had identified great quality and value.) Staff Staff were polite courteous and responsive to any problems. The restaurant manager appeared to be quite strict with his staff, but his priority was the customer and he pushed them to meet customers expectations. He himself did the rounds checking repeatedly with guests to see that everything was OK, again very reasponsive when minor hic-cups did occur. The reception staff were Polite and Helpful. Closing Comments : We had a great time and really enjoyed our stay , We would have no hesitation in recommending it to other travellers. I was worried about staying outwith the city centre but in reality this was a blessing, and it was so nice to escape to the calm of the coutryside in the evenings after being in the hussle and bustle all day.

We were travelling from Romania to Ireland via Rome and missed our first connecting flight, so we had to find somewhere to stay overnight in Rome. So we purely needed a place to sleep for that one night, we weren't looking for anything too fancy and couldn't have afforded it anyway. We booked a room at the Palacavicchi through the hotel reservations desk at Ciampino airport. We just told the clerk that we wanted to stay somewhere close by, that was cheap, secure and reasonably clean. She recommended the Palacavicchi, so we ended up there. It was about two minutes away from the airport and the taxi driver knew it by name, so we didn't have to worry about giving directions. The reception staff were polite and after checking in, we went to our room. It was very basic, as we'd expected it to be, but was clean and comfortable enough. The bathroom was ok, pretty clean apart from the shower which wasn't that nice - discoloured and old looking, also smelled a bit mouldy. But it wasn't dirty as such, everything had obviously been recently cleaned, just needed refitting perhaps. We had dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The restaurant was much better than we were expecting it to be. We only ate there because it was late at night and we were too tired to go anywhere else. But we were surprised by how elegant and comfortable it was, we'd been expecting it to be somewhat dingy and depressing on account of it's being in a cheap airport hotel. But no, it was actually very relaxed and pleasant and it felt more like a being in a real restaurant than a hotel dining room. The waiters were helpful and friendly and there was a lot of choice on the menu. Prices very reasonable and the food was good. The house wine was lovely, which was a nice suprise too. Breakfast in the restaurant next morning was continental buffet. Nothing very special at all but the croissants were nice enough. We were in a hurry anyway and only wanted to grab a coffee and something to eat quickly before catching our plane home, so it was more than adequate for us. Anyway, I'd be happy to stay there again if I was in Rome for one night and just needed a place to sleep. It's basic but cheap, clean and secure and it's efficiently run. Some reviews have complained about the staff being rude but I really didn't find that at all - they weren't effusive but they were perfectly polite and helpful, or perhaps my husband and I were just lucky! But I wouldn't choose the Palacavicchi as somewhere to stay for a real holiday or city break, it's just too basic, even if you're not looking for somewhere luxurious and romantic.

Had read that it has a half decent restaurant and that proved to be the case. It is quite difficult to find and not helped by the fact that what signage there is does not even mention Palacavicchi - it's actually a rather tacky sign for the Altro something restuarant! Luckily I had printed off detailed (and very accurate) directions from a website I'm afraid I have now forgotten - but if you are going there defintely look for a detailed description of how to find it! It did seem that there was virtually no thickness to the walls of the rooms and I think we were lucky in that it was not noisy the night we were there. Also I think we were lucky that our room was not too far from reception/restaurant.

Forget it.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3813360", "Content": "Before booking this hotel, you have to ask yourself 2 fundamental questions. 1. Have you got children who require a cot? 2. Are you booking this Hotel purely on the basis that it's the closest Hotel to Ciampino Airport or is it a base for a holiday? If the answer is Yes for number 1 - forget it. They don't have children's cots. Quite unbelieveably they acknowledge on the booking form the age of your children and accept your money, but forget to tell you they have no infant facilities whatsoever! We booked this hotel because it was our last night in Italy and we had been staying 2 hrs north of Rome with our 7 month old son. When we arrived at the hotel they told us they had no cots for infants. And remember, no matter what you argue, if they haven't got a cot, they haven't got one! So what to do? Well bear in mind this is Saturday evening. We'd just spent all day driving down from northern Umbria. Our son was tired and hungry. WE were tired and hungry. Were we about to go looking for another hotel? Not especially. The best the hotel could do was put another matress in the room on the floor beside our bed - which turned out to be 2 singles and not the double we booked. And because we had booked and paid up front there was little haggling to be done on the price either. Something that completely astonished me was that the staff told us that they had never had an infant stay in their hotel! Come on....both RyanAir and EasyJet both fly 1000's of people into Ciampino airport, and in all that time they were seriously telling us no-one with a child requiring a cot had ever stayed in their hotel ? Hard to believe, but there you go. So what about the rest of the Hotel? Well - think big Travelodge. It has a large restauraunt which does serve admittedly nice pizzas - something the hotel is particularly proud of - well it has to have something going for it! The rooms are in blocks behind the reception area that extend out for what seems like miles ending up at guess what? Yep - the END OF THE RUNWAY at Ciampino Airport! And I really mean literally the end of the runway. Walk up to the end of the room blocks to the fence, stand on your tippy toes looking over the fence and there you have it - a Boeing 737 ready to blast off into the sunset. So don't be going to bed early thinking you'll get a good night's sleep - you won't. If it's not the palnes taking off 100 yards away, the beds have to be the most uncomfortable planks of wood I have ever slept on. In fact camping out is a better sleep than this. Back to my 2nd question I posed at the top of this review - are you using this hotel because it's close to the airport or as a holiday base? Well the rooms are basic and small. You're not going to want to spend any time in them whatsoever - except trying to sleep. The hotel isn't exactly in a great area of Rome either, and the directions on their website are rubbish - you won't find them using their website map - or any as I found. This is because the Hotel name isn't displayed on their sign except in teeny-weeny letters you need binoculars to read. We drove past it thinking it was parking for the airport. So to summarise. If you need somewhere to crash the night before your flight out of Italy that's within spitting distance of the airport that's impossible to find on a map, has no sign posts, is noisey, uncomfortable and your child has to sleep on the floor, but you like pizza, then this is for you! p.s. believe it or not, if you don't book a table in the restaurant you won't be eating before 9.30pm - bizzarely the place was stuffed!", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "stockton", "Title": "\u201cclose to airport\u201d", "Author": "brightspark", "ReviewID": "UR3725682", "Content": "very close to airport bathroom drains stank - shower stall rusty and dirty. breakfast ok staff quite helpful", "Date": "July 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCiampino Borstal\u201d", "Author": "absintheur", "ReviewID": "UR3612188", "Content": "I cannot stress enough how terrible this place really is. Out of sheer necessity we booked a room here as we were flying into Ciampino just before midnight with the intention of hiring a car and driving south. After seeing the review above it was with a relatively heavy heart that I booked a room. I just didn't fancy a meaningless trip in and out of Roma when our true destination was Ravello. The hotel is convenient for Ciampino. That is where the plus points end. The compound is layed out like a military barracks and it likely was this as Ciampino was mainly a military airfield. The room was scruffy and spartan. The sheets were clean, however. The walls were paper thin and we shared our experience with the loudest snorer on the planet! Unfortuneate maybe. The walls were so thin though that our other neighbour's discreet conversation could be clearly heard. As a \"piece de resistance\" an all night dance venue was set up in a warehouse/field next to the hotel which kept us entertained with 120bpm dance music and whistle blowing until dawn. The breakfast was adequate. We left on the bus to Ciampino to collect our hire care feeling no more rested than if we had slept in the arrivals hall.
