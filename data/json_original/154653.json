{"Reviews": [{"Content": "What a Steal! I grew up in Mexico City. I now do business in Mexico and I frequently fly there. Whenever I'm in Mexico City I stay at the Compostela. The rooms are great (try a suite in the new section of the hotel). I stay in one of their suites with a huge king sized bed for just $300 pesos per night. The staff is friendly and you are within walking distance of many major attractions. There is an art fair held every Sunday just accross the street in Sullivan Park. Don't miss it. This place is a steal! Free parking in case you drive there.", "Date": "Jul 5, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR731481434", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Well maintained - good location at a fair price A small hotel which is well maintained and located within easy walking distance to the Zona Rosa. There is a new section which has recently been completed and is very clean and comfortable. The rooms are not large but contain all that is necessary for a short time. The staff is accommodating and prompt with requests. The only problem is that after dark, just one block up the street, there are women lined up for the evening. They are not involved in the hotel in any way. I would definitely return again.", "Date": "Mar 20, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR415919181", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d154653-r2268428-Compostela-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "154653", "Price": "$14"}}
