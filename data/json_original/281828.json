A wonderful touch and very much appreciated on a later arrival. What I didn't love was the Terraces bar was understaffed, and the service was not to the level we would expect. What I was incredibly disappointed in was the $42 per night for parking. I could have left my car at a number of neighboring hotels and paid $10-15 less without being a guest.

The Fairmont Olympic is in downtown Seattle, between 4th and 5th Avenue. It was built in 1924 and was previously the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel. Location is great with a 5 min walk to the water front and main shopping arcades. It has grand entrance area, large lobby and plenty of friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are a reasonable size but not all have yet been updated. There is no double glazing so rooms on front tend to be noisy from 6am onwards. Some rooms have glimpses of surrounding mountains and Puget SOund. Did not eat in the the Georgian restaurant but the Conference food was varied and very good. There is also the slightly less formal Shuckers in the basement. Breakfast is pricey at $27 but you can eat as well in the Belle Epicurean in the arcade or cheaply nearby in Starbucks. The Spa and health centre is well equipped and there is a business centre bizarrely on the 12th floor. It has a presidential suite and indeed Jimmy Carter stayed during the conference week! There are \"town cars\" including an XJ12 Jaguar which will take you around town free-of-charge on a first come first served basis. Slight minus points - no on site rental cars (but there is an Alamo in nearby Hilton), you can only drop off or wait for 10 mins, valet parking is expensive, wifi is not free and drinks in the bar are expensive.

Free wi-fi made up for the cost of room service though. Some draw backs are that the hallways are long and a lot of the views are not very desirable.

First impression is that the hospital is very early-century chic. Although a horrible analogy, in many ways I feel like I have boarded the Titanic (in a good, non-sinking way). There is opulence everywhere but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over stated. When entering the lobby the first thing you notice is that it is 2 stories (main level and mezzanine level). Check in was very quick (I called the night before so that I could check in at 7:30 am) and I had no problems. In fact, I was upgraded (complimentary) to a deluxe executive suite. That makes a good first impression. When I entered the room, I was surprised to see a sitting room. Off to the side of the sitting room is the bedroom with king bed (separated by French doors). There is a flat screen TV in the bedroom and one in the sitting room. The sitting room has a chair, sofa bed, desk/chair, end table, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153refreshment center.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The mini bar is definitely fully stocked with 18 small bottles of liquor, a bottle of wine, bottle of champagne, some beer, some juice, some water, and some soda as well as candy, cookies, and chips. Beware, however, the minibar isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap. A liter bottle of water is $8.00. The entry way holds the closet (with safe) and a chest of drawers. There is an umbrella and robes in the closet. Also in the closet is an ironing board. The bathroom (next to the entry) is well appointed with marble countertops/floors. I like the scale in the bathroom. The shower is a tub/shower combo. I found the bed to be very comfortable and it seemed as if there were two types of pillows on the bed, both firm and soft. There was a simple alarm clock next to the bed. On the first evening, I awoke at midnight to a soft beeping sound. I thought that an alarm in an adjacent room must be going off. It sounded strangely close, however and I realized that it was coming from the sitting room. There is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sound machine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd radio with alarm in there and the alarm had been left \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for midnight. Lesson learned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always check all alarms. The hotel staff are amazing and very accommodating. Everyone says hello and several have called the elevator as I was approaching. The food has been excellent (privately catered in The Garden), although the meals were constructed somewhat oddly (Green beans, salad, pasta, and 5 kinds of meat just seemed a little too Atkins). The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153health club\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is very large with dressing rooms for both men and women. The dressing room has individual showers and lockers. There are 3 ellipticals, 6 treadmills, a stair climber, and a recumbent bike in one room and the other contains free weights as well as some universal equipment. Each piece of cardio equipment has its own TV/DVD. Just ask for headphones at the health club desk. The desk also has complimentary water Just on the other side of a glass wall is the swimming pool and spa. The staff can be seen bringing beverages and food to people poolside. From a business meeting perspective, be aware that it can be a bit noisy at times. If you are in a large room, the food and beverages are in the room with you. Every time the staff come in to refresh your drinks, they will be stacking coffee cups or adding ice to the bowls holding the drinks. It can get a bit annoying after a while. This is a very minor complaint. If you happen to be in one of their smaller meeting rooms, the food and beverages are kept outside of the room so this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue. All in all, I had a great experience. The staff were always accommodating. The hotel is in need of some renovations (not because it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153looks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bad, just to get it a bit more up to date). For example, the thermostat in my room was probably 30 years old. One would expect something a little more sophisticated than a dial. There is some wear and tear noted. However, there is nothing screaming that it needs repaired. As previous reviews noted, the hotel is centrally located so there is easy access to many of Seattle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best attractions.

Second time I think I forgot to specify renovated room, or they interpreted \"renovated\" = \"upgrade\" because they upgraded us to a small suite. But it wasn't renovated, and boy did that room pale in comparison with the one we stayed in the first time we were here! I called down to the front desk and asked if any renovated rooms were available. They told me there was one on a lower floor if that was OK, and I said that was no problem. The manager actually ran the keys to our new room up to us in about 2 minutes! THAT is service! Kudos to you, Fairmont Olympic. The new room was also a suite, and the renovated rooms are SO MUCH NICER. Nicer bedding, cleaner-looking lines, nice paint tones, newer finishings like light switch face plates, nice new marble bathroom. I would probably give this place 3 or 4 stars if I had stayed in the original room they gave me during that stay. The hotel itself is in a good location - if you're heading out to I-5, you just go straight up the street a couple of blocks and you're there. Lots of restaurants, the SAM, and pike place market within blocks. There's a hotel car that can take you around the downtown area. The first time I stayed, I was having dinner at Canlis as part of the \"find a key and get free dinner at Canlis\" thing in October (I was graciously invited for helping! :) and I mentioned that I needed a taxi to one of the valets. Well, he told me to hang on and that he'd see if he could get the hotel car to take me. It was free, so they gave me a free ride to Canlis, which I must say is not exactly in the \"downtown core\", either. You guys are the best! The second time we stayed, it was a busier night so we had to wait about 20 minutes for the car to take us somewhere, but the driver was great, again (different guy). We were going to Kneehigh Stocking company, which is a speakeasy-type place and purposefully difficult to find. Well, our driver was so thoughtful - he made sure that he knew exactly where this place was before he would drop us off, probably so he'd know where to pick us up later that night, but it was really nice of him.

The regular rooms though are quite spacious. It has the big beds, the old dark furniture the older style couch and the big screen flat screen. A very nice mix of old and new. The lobby is stunning big, lots of marble and buzz and during Xmas when we were there decked with a 50 foot tree. The highlights of the hotel are service, use the doorman a few times to get a cab or wait for a ride and they remember your name and details. Ask the concierge to do something and they knock themselves out. The lobby bar has a great happy hour and is pricey after that -$12-16 cocktails and this is Seattle not NYC. The pricing of food and drink is one of the big issues I have with the hotel. My mother had a bowel of Oatmeal and a coffee and the bill came to $16. Now I spent over $5,000 at the hotel on rooms and a party but the prices for a drink or a bowl of cereal was just out of line with Seattle. By the way the wireless in the 51 room line - we had 851 and 951 was very very weak but the desk system worked great. I love older hotels with great service and new touches.

This location is fantastic! It is walking distance to everything: The Convention Center, Pike's Place, shopping, and even the Space Needle if you're up for a walk. We made it to the Space Needle going down 4th street which is about 1.3 miles away (Lucky that there wasn't any rain!). The hotel is very old, and beautiful. The room was good sized, with a complimentary paper each morning, robes and slippers. We had a corner room with a peek of the space needle and the rooftops nearby. We chose to self-park around the corner at the structure. However, just a word of warning if you need an accessible entrance. Unfortunately, the only way to get from the self-park structure to the street is down some stairs or through an attached convenience store when stairs cannot be used (Which a security guard had to come meet us after calling on the call box and show us the way). The store is open I believe from 7am-9pm - so this means, if you plan to self -park outside of these hours and cannot use stairs, you are stuck. When we pulled up to the Valet parking at the Fairmont, we explained we were going to self-park so the valets wouldn't have to mess with the hand controls on the car. It would have been nice if they had let us know there were restrictions on the accessibility of the parking garage. I understand this doesn't apply to most people...but again, would have been nice to know. If we weren't driving over to Spokane after, we wouldn't have needed a car. It sat in the garage from arrival until check-out. I would recommend not renting a car if you are staying at the Fairmont and don't need to drive out of town. The bathroom in our room was nice and big, and was probably one of the coldest I have ever stayed in due to the single pane window. Ahh...the charm of old buildings! :) Unfortunately, we didn't have time to check out \"Purple\" a wine bar across the street, but it will definitely be on our list next time!

Fitness was adequate, did not use indoor pool but it looked nice. The staff in the fitness center also did a great job making sure we had plenty water, clean towels etc. Check out was fast and easy. Only one complaint, it would have been nice if the desk in the room had more outlets on top so you don't have to crawl under it to plug in your devices and chargers.

Just sign up for their \"President's Club\" any time during your stay (which is free), and they remove the internet charges. Not the greatest internet as it is sometimes weak and unreliable (more reason not to pay for it) but when I wrote a message to customer service complaining about it, the IT manager called me and increased the bandwidth.

The hotel is very well situated in downtown Seattle with easy access to all the sights and the interstate. Overall, this hotel is great because of the staff - they are always kinds, courteous and very helpful. The staff who greet you at the front door/front drive are extremely kind and helpfully. The staff at the reception desk have always been very pleasant and quick to process your check-in. I've never had to wait long for assistance. Without requesting it, I've been upgraded a few times to a larger room. The lobby is a comfortable space that is flexible enough to work as a quick (business) meeting place or just a casual rendez-vous. I recommend that people look into the Fairmont member (President membership?). Even if you reserve through an alternative site such as a hotels.com (which usually always has a great deal for this hotel), you can use your membership to access free internet (a cost savings of $15/day!). Although if you book using the alternative site, you cannot collect points using your membership card. I don't care too much about the points; I mostly join these memberships for the savings on things like internet and breakfast. The hotel has always been quiet; I don't hear noise from the street or from the hallway. The rooms tend to be large compared with other hotels (and especially compared to hotels in the North East). Although the decor may need a little refresher, the rooms are well appointed with everything you need (minus a coffee machine, which you can request be sent to your room). All toiletries are provided for, including a hair dried and iron. A safe and a mini fridge/bar are also included. The last time I stayed at the hotel, I had a delicious meal at the restaurant Zoe; it was delicious but too rich. At 2am, I called the front desk to ask if they had anything for a sour tummy. A few minutes later, someone brought to my room a small cloth bag containing a box of medication. How fancy! Very swift and very discreet. This last time, I forget some toiletries but all the shops were closed so I went to reception where the have a basket of products available for purchase. It was overly-priced, but that is the cost of convenience I guess. The restaurants and bars in the hotel are very nice and the staff are amazing!! I've used the valet car service the last two times I've stayed and was pleased, although the phone number they gave us to call ahead to have a car waiting didn't work. No matter really, I never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for the car to be brought. The in/out privileges are very convenient if you have several meetings throughout the day.

The Fairmont is not the type of property I typically select for leisure travel. I prefer more modern and clean design. Having said that, the Fairmont is truly a beautiful hotel. The lobby is gorgeous in an \"old world\" way with chandeliers and ornate decorations. The Georgian Room where breakfast and tea service (in the afternoon) takes place is regal and simply beautiful. The check-in staff were extremely helpful and I provided me with exactly the type of room I had requested. The lower floors have bathrooms that have been recently renovated. So I opted for a room on the fourth floor. My room with a King Bed was extremely spacious and had all the modern amenities and was sound proof. The bathroom was fabulous -- it could have been a bedroom by itself (just based on size). The decor of the room is in keeping with the feel and style of this hotel -- printed curtains, carved tables and so forth. The bed was extremely comfortable. My only complaint about the room was that the power outlets were not in convenient locations if one is trying to do work away from the desk and chair set up. Overall, the service at the hotel was excellent. The concierge team was extremely helpful and suggested some great places for me to eat at. The hotel has an excellent french patisserie in the lower level called Belle Epecurean. Highly recommend getting your morning coffee and even a sandwich to go for later in the day from this place. The owners of the patisserie trained at \"Le Cordon Bleu\" in France and have brought a range of french delicacies to Seattle. The location of the Fairmont is extremely convenient to get to Pike Street Market, Capitol Hill, the major museums, Seattle Center and so forth. A big thumbs up for convenience on that front.

Walking with a carry-on luggage up what was about 7 blocks (Seattle's actually very hilly, hillier then Sanfrancisco) was rather a challange and work out. When I got to the hotel I was greated by staff asking to assist me with my carry-on, wish that had been 8 blocks down the hill. The young lady that chcked me in was very nice and professional, her name was Emily. I asked her quite a few questions, all of which she answered and then when I looked back there was a big line-up and a concierge desk which I could've gone to, it was nice of her to help me. At at the little cafe a quick croissant and safe latte and it was lovely, like french patisserie. There was always someone present in the lobby so if I had any directions questions or recommendations there was always someone readily accesible to answer my questions. The pool and gym area were lovely as was the entry and sitting area and the shrubbery and outside of the property. The room was clean and fresh and I am rather particular about hotel cleanliness. The room was large and bathroom was very large. The windows were on level with other rooms windows making me feel uncomfortable to leave the window open at anytime in the case of a room invasion and fresh air would've been nice. The light above the sink was burnt and didn't really matter to me but that the maintenance person came within 15 minutes of me checking in to fix it, this should've been done prior to my check-in so, I declined him coming in and asked he return after I check-out. The only thing I REALLY didn't like about the hotel was that the location was a bit out of the way causing me to taxi many places and I like somewhere in a prime location so, I can walk everywhere. Again, had I had more time in the city perhaps the location wouldn't have been an issue but it was because I was pressed for time and seeing as it wa out of the way I took at least 6 taxis that could've been easily avoided.

The exterior is classic, and upon entering the \"Lobby\", a grand mult-floor height marble hall, one feels like this is one of the grand European hotels. We were married here several years ago, in a small family-only ceremony in the Cascade Suite, a marvelous one-bedrom 3,400 sqft suite with a private dining room (where we had a private dinner served). Unfortunately, there is no way to make that into a suite with several bedrooms, despite the grand living area; the most that can be enclosed in privacy - and safety for young children - is with one other executive suite. Therefore, we've also stayed in the only 3BR suite in the Hotel (still not quite large enough for the family). As far as we know, the other corner suites are 2BR at most. Usually, when it is just the two of us, we stay in a large executive suite, and occasionally in the larger bedroom (part of the corner parlor suite that goes with the 2-bedroom suite... and with the one 3-bedroom suite). As wonderful as this hotel is, there are some problems with the heating system, such that it is tricky to get a room that isn't too warm. We now know which rooms to request, and we call ahead and remind the Front Desk staff that we'd like the thermostat turned \"as cool as possible\". The service here is absolutely the best. With special requests for a large extended family, the hotel staff came through with everything from tiny bathrobes for children (which we of course purchased for the grandchildren!) to getting a prescription refilled on short notice. And we've arranged special meals in the Georgian Room (the first time, when we could still hand-carry a special bottle of wine on board a commercial flight), and it was just perfect. We tried another hotel, and we walked out of the new Four Seasons (The Olympic *used to be* a Four Seasons), which was in one of the few seamy areas left in downtown. We then tried one of the new high-rise hotels, but it was like walking into the (small) lobby of an office building, simply to be spirited upstairs on the elevator right by the front door. (To due justice to this other Hotel, it did have a wonderfully huge and deep bathtub, with water that came out of the ceiling; if only our grandchldren could have seen THIS!) But the suite was just \"another modern hotel suite\", albeit one with very soothing displays on the walls, a very \"zen\" sensation to be sure, one lasting the full stay.

The decor certainly didn't disappoint and the staff were wonderful, I was so excited when we arrived. Not long after we arrived I began to feel ill and had an asthma attack. The next morning I thought I may be able to shake it off so we went sight seeing but I was still not myself so we went back to the room to rest and as soon as I stepped into our room I was overwhelmed with chemicals and had a massive asthma attack, I could feel my face begin to puff up and I was very ill. My husband who never notices any thing said he could taste the chemicals. I knew I couldn't stay in this room or at the hotel but wasn't sure what to do so I called the front desk and Edward who is in charge of security came to see how I was doing, he said there was a car waiting to take me to the hospital, I declined as a hospital bill was the last thing I needed on a holiday. This was probably a mistake. Edward made arrangements to move us to another room and this room was a lovely suite but sadly I couldn't enjoy it as I was far to ill and just went to bed, so no sightseeing for me. Edward did say that they are soon to change to greener cleaners but at this stage they were still using harsh chemicals. What ever it was in that room was very harsh. The kindness of staff was so appreciated at this time. I later on had a visitor who had a reaction at the hotel when she went to the toilets in the hotel, so at this stage I am thinking this is not just me. I was feeling a little better the following day when we checked out but still had lumps over my torso which were itchy, so it wasn't fun. My two nights in Seattle were not my most memorable.

Things made a fairly smooth transition until the \"great recession\" hit a couple of years ago. I appreciate that the economy fell off a cliff but sadly, one of its casualties was the Olympic. They have greatly reduced staff and it shows. The remaining staff remains upbeat and professional but there are not enough of them. I have stayed here at least annually since 1984. I used to think it was the best hotel in America. No more. The rooms are down at their heels. The fitness center and pool are stunning but filthy. The locker rooms are infrequently tended to so I found it trashed on 2 of the 3 visits I made there. They have some tables at the end of the swimming pool along w/a couple of loveseat sized seats all of which had garbage and food remnants under them. Our breakfast in the Georgian room was an absolute disaster. There were about 10 occupied tables and ONE person tending to all 10 tables. At one point the phone rang, and rang, and rang. Nobody ever picked it up but it rang, loud enough to be heard throughout the whole of that stunning room, for a good 3 or 4 minutes until whomever was calling gave up. Thank goodness. With the economy coming back, perhaps the ownership will spend the money it takes to return the Olympic to its former standing. However, they've lost me and my business. There is a new Four Season in town and the Pan Pacific has recently opened. The Inn at the Market is reliable. All in all, The Olympic has skidded so significantly that I have concluded that it's beyond repair. I shared all of this with the front desk manager when I left who expressed his sympathies. I wrote the general manager who sent me a generic letter that didn't even attempt to address the hotel's failures.

My only real complaint is that the towels were thin and not soft at all but 2 robes were provided which was a nice touch.

Literally 10 feet away from both of our windows was another wall. If you crouched down and looked right up you could just see the sky but it made the room very dark - even when we had really sunny days. It was also quite noisy, mainly from street noise. I know we were staying in a busy city but I don't think being on the 2nd floor really helps you to get away from the noise of the traffic.

Best Parts - central location - you can walk anywhere downtown from this hotel - car service - if you don't feel like walking, ask the hotel for a complimentary ride - cookies and milk - when you check-out and get your vehicle from valet, they give you a farewell gift: cookies and milk. - health club - has large indoor pool & hot tub avec semi-retractable roof and great gym - dog-friendliness - hotel is dog friendly. staff are dog friendly. has patch of grass in front of hotel that dogs can use. very convenient. - terrace bar pianist - had some well-priced appies & drinks at the terrace bar whilst listening to the sweet sounds of the pianist. he played one of the best medleys i've ever heard including renditions from Wicked Musical, Seal, Little Mermaid.... - the french cafe (Belle Epicurean) located in the hotel's lower lobby has amazing croissants, a gorgeous espresso machine and bistro decor - the staff. the level of service by everyone we encountered was to the highest standard. we even witnessed a guest disputing with a hotel employee and the staff member was always professional and gracious. Not Ideal - $36 valet parking (this is standard for a city hotel; just feels wrong to pay that amount:) - beds. stayed in a deluxe room but bed was not to that standard. there was a canoe-effect. - certain parts of rooms are lovely (bathroom), but the carpet and furniture look tired. Hints - you can avoid paying $36/night for valet parking by finding a spot on the street. The only catch is that no cars are allowed on the street during 7 - 9am, so you have to get up early and move your vehicle. We did this the first night because we saw street parking right away and wanted to get up early. The second night, we opted for valet. - you can get free internet (and a host of other benefits) if you join fairmont's loyalty program: President's Club", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bend, OR", "Title": "\u201cLove this hotel, except coffee\u201d", "Author": "yreme", "ReviewID": "UR59779991", "Content": "The Olympic is truely one of the best hotels in Seattle.

The rooms are exceptionally clean and appointed to make you feel comfortable and safe. The halls are bright and the hotel sparkles from the care that is taken to make it comfortable, the bed was one of the most comfortable that I have experienced in a long time. I belong to a health club were I live in the Chicago area and have found the health club in the Olympic to be exceptionally outstanding. The friendly staff greats you with a freindly greating and cold bottle of water. The pool is heated to 86 degrees and has a waterfall feature with a large spa. The locker rooms are large and have a sauna, private locked lockers, all the necessary amenities and even apples in a basket. Couldn't be happier. We went to the Georgean room for breakfast and Schuckers for dinner. For breakfast, we chose the buffet in the Georgean Room. I was like eating in a ballroom. The cereal included home made grenolla and steel cut oatmeal with a choice to add hot bacon, sausage and eggs. It was very good. Dinner in Schuckers was outstanding. We went for \"Happy Hour\". When we where seated, at 4:30, we were offered the lunch menu in addition to the \"Happy Hour\" menu. The \"Happy Hour\" menu included tap pints @ $3 and fresh oysters @ $1. I chose both and was not dissapointed. The beer included local micro's and was excellent. The oysters were amoungst the best that I have had. I selected the salmon form the lunch menu and couldn't have chosen better. The lunch menu includes similar items to the dinner menu but at a lower cost.

The room itself has french doors that can close off the bedroom from the living area and so my friend was taking the sofabed while I was in the king in this bedroom area. We dropped out stuff to head out to meet up with some friends and returned around midnight only to discover the hideabed was hiding and no amount of leverage would get it to open up. A call down to the front desk had both house keeping and maintenance arriving very quickly for that time of night and after an hour of the two staff trying to unfold the sofabed, it was decided that because all the rollaways were occupied a mattress and bedding could be put on the floor to allow us to call it a night and so it was made up quickly. Over coffee the next morning the friend was impressed they had staff on call at that time of night and that the matter had been resolved as it had, a point of view I shared. After more entertaining and sightseeing we arrived back later in the day to find a little note saying the sofabed had been fixed but that the mattress would be left and the guest could sleep that second night in whichever they preferred. Knowing sometimes sofabed mattresses can be less comfortable, my friend opted to spend the night on the floor again and said it was more than alright with him. While the whole matter was handled well by the staff from a customer service perspective I was a bit unimpressed with the quality of furnishing in what is termed a Deluxe Executive King Suite as the malfunctioning sofabed was older and worn in very visible places and seemed out of place in a room otherwise quite well appointed. Had we been in a tiny and standard room worn furinishings would've surprised me less than in the pricier and larger suite category. I know the Olympic has been around for 80+ years and older hotels can show their age at times and in places so won't hold it against the hotel entirely as it didn't take away entirely from what otherwise was a pleasant stay. One note about the french doors on the king suite part of the room was that they were fabric only, not glass, so closing the doors really didn't do much to shut out the sound from the living room area, such as the TV or from a telephone conversation. Especially for families I could see it being a bit of a downside not having a more soundproof bedroom area so they could put little ones to bed and watch TV for a while without disturbing them too much. When I had seen the doors in other guests pictures and on the Fairmont website I guess I hust assumed they were more than thin almost see through fabric. The fitness facility and pool area was a nice getaway spot, though at only 4 feet or so at its deepest the pool seemed a tad shallow for my liking. The outdoor patio's adjacent to the pool made for a nice place to spend some time reading the paper on a warm summer morning and some chaise loungers would've made it even more relaxing but there were none in sight. The Fairmont is very central and within walking distance of sights such as Pike Place Market, Safeco Field and numberous bars & restaurants in the downtown core. Having a rental car we parked at a nearby underground lot for $7 as they Fairmont was more than triple that amount. We were told that they waive the valet parking fee however if you're driving a hybrid so will remember that for next visit. Since we were visiting friends around Seattle over the weekend we didn't eat at the hotel but noted the typically high buffet breakfast prices and would imagine the evening meals would be in the same sort of premium compared to off-site dining options. For a getaway with friends being right downtown was a definate bonus and if I was in town again I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Fairmont Olympic for a good price as the one I grabbed well in advance.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northshore - Chicago", "Title": "\u201cReally Disappointing...\u201d", "Author": "Movin4444", "ReviewID": "UR41408775", "Content": "The hotel looks old, antiquated and tired.

Stayed in a Deluxe Executive for the extra space . Had a king bed for the adults and a pull out sofa for two of the children. Had booked a rollaway for the third child. Reminded the people at check in and they said it should be in our room but was not there when we got to the room. Went for a swim and still no rollaway. Called front desk again and was told one would be sent up immediately. Finally, (over 1 hr later) housekeeping called to say they had no beds. I said it was unaccepatable as I had booked the bed at time of reservation and needed it for my third child. They were very nice - tried to borrow one from nearby hotels but no luck. At long last they came with a mattress which they put on the floor and tried to make it into a nice bed for my son. They also brought little boxes of chocolates for each of my 3 kids as they had to stay up a bit late to wait for a bed - something they didn't mind a bit. \"A\" for effort on the part of the staff, but I was still a little disappointed. Other than that, both positives and negitives for our stay. On the plus side, room was nice and big, pool was good (when empty), great fitness area, all staff we interacted with were great plus the valets left us a package of milk and cookies in our car when we checked out - a definite hit with the kids for our drive home. Also, each night room service brought complimentary cookies and milk to our room. The negatives were pretty minor - pool at busy times was crowded with kids that their parents showed no interest in supervising, the bed issue, minor problems with the TV controls and very, very slow service in the excellent Georgian Lounge. Small problems, but I like to stay in the best and therefore expect the best. However, all in all would go there again.

I would recommend valet parking even at the outrageous price of $36.00 a day. Other nearby parking garages I saw were charging $30.00 as their daily rate, so why not pay the difference to the hotel and let them park and bring your car to you) Fabulous exercise room with the latest equipment well maintained with an excellant indoor pool and spa. Very nice touch providing complementary bottled water and Washington State Red Delicious apples at poolside. Well appointed and maintained men's locker room/shower with plenty of towels and various toiletries. Operating hours of the pool/heath club I believe were weekdays it opened at 5:00 A.M weekdays 6:00 A.M weekends, closing at 10:00 P.M. Quite adequate. We did not dine at either Shuckers or the Georgian which are on the property Both restaurants appeared to be very elegent however, and I have no doubts that the food is quite good. For cheapskates such as myself, Bernard's on Seneca just a block from the hotel would be a fine choice for either breakfast or lunch. I will give the room a 4.5 diamond rating. A 5.0 diamond for service, but a 4 diamond room overall. Details follows: Compliments: My wife and stayed in a deluxe king suite on August 6 and August 7. The room itself, the sleeping area, and bathroom are spotless . Nice touch providing bathrobes for guests. Water pressure in the shower while not great is more than adequate. Complementary daily New York TImes and Seattle Times brought to your doorstep each morning.. Housekeeping filling your ice bucket. daily Very classy indeed. Critical comments: The room is somewhat under furnished. A second armchair and ottoman would have been nice for the wife and myself to use to watch television together . it would be nice to have a coffee maker in the room. There is a nearby Starbucks, (they are on practically every major street downtown, along with a Tully's and Seattle Best Coffee also nearby for those of you that may have issues with Starbucks. Then again, not everyone would want to leave the property to get coffee ( I did, because room service prices are simply outrageous, but then that is SOP at all hotels) Hotel location -Fabulous- University Street station is just a couple of blocks away, which offers subway service to Pioneer Square, Chinatown. Mariners/Seahawks stadium and if I am not mistaken, in December 2009 to Seatac airport. . Seattle's public transportation system does have designated \"free zones\". ie you can ride public transporation for free with limitations. Please ask the hotel about that upon your arrival Pike's market, several block walk away In conclusion, if you are planning to stay in downtown Seattle, and price is not a consideration , this is the place to stay. At times this year I have noticed this is the most expensive property downtown. If price is an object,( for some of us rooms starting at $300.00+ a night + tax+ parking is simply too much money) watch for specials. Be patient. It will be well worth the time and effort.

We took the airport shuttle to the Fairmont Olympic hotel -- which arrives at the back entrance. We dragged our luggage into the lobby and checked in at the main desk. The staff was courteous, but I found it strange that no one asked if we needed help with our bags. The room was nice, though the furniture is somewhat dated. We had a room with a king size bed. The room had a sitting area with a sofa, chairs and flat screen TV and a separate bedroom with another flat screen TV. I did not find the problems that others have described, such as leaking sinks or stained and dirty furniture -- everything seemed in good repair. Except for the ironing board, which was a cheap piece of junk. It was flimsy and refused to lock into place until I turned it over on the floor and physically bent the locking mechanism back into place. It collapsed twice before being repaired. I was just glad that I didn't have a hot iron on it when it fell. I did have one issue that might not bother some, but it really bothers me. In an age when everyone has a cell phone, probably a laptop computer and likely a digital camera etc. that needs to be recharged, why don't hotels put some form of power strip on the desk in the hotel room? Our hotel room had a very nice writing desk with a lamp, telephone etc. However, to plug in any sort of charger, you were required to pull the desk out in order to reach the single available outlet back in the corner. Good luck plugging in two things at once, unless you are unplugging something else. No chance finding an outlet that is not behind some heavy piece of furniture. I did get the idea that the hotel is short on staff. The first morning, the promised wake up call never came. One day we stayed in our room past noon and received a phone call from the housekeeping staff to call housekeeping before 10 pm if we wanted to have the room cleaned. I appreciated the fact that they hadn't knocked since we had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door. We called housekeeping and left a voice mail message at about 2:00 pm that we would like the room cleaned. No one ever showed up to clean the room and we never received a phone call or other message as to why the room could not be cleaned.

After many phone calls and that ate up our evening, they moved us to another room and offered breakfast the next morning. Things would have been fine, but unfortunately, this was only the beginning of the poor service we received during our stay. 2. We asked the Concierge about seafood in the area. He pulled out a book of menus. We looked them over, selected the entr\u00c3\u00a9e we desired and the Conciege gave us directions for the six block walk. Once we arrived at the restaurant, the waiter informed us that the menu displayed at the Fairmont was changed several years ago. Needless to say, the entr\u00c3\u00a9e we wanted was no longer available at the restaurant. 3. I booked a relaxing massage. Upon arrival, I was directed to a room with no air conditioning and loud music / group noise echoing from the pool a few steps outside my door. Not a relaxing environment for a massage! It was very loud and the sweating uncomfortably, I decided to cancel the long awaited massage. 4.

He said the car was not big enough for us and our luggage\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.we were shocked\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.because the hotel uses a Town Car\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much bigger than that and we only had carry on luggage! Then he said the pier was too far away. We were totally frustrated by this point and said that in lieu of the problems we had encountered, it was the least he could do.

I have wanted to stay here for about 5 years and when I saw the Executive Suite room being offered on Expedia for $169/night this was too good to pass up. We stayed at this hotel for two nights, I could live here. From the moment we checked in, we were treated like royalty at this 5 star hotel in downtown Seattle. Check in went very smoothly, we arrived late, after a 15 hour drive and had dinner ressies at Etta's, our town car driver took us there and was very prompt when we wanted to be picked up. The town cars are 2009 Lexus, very plush and the driver's very professional and knowledgeable about the Seattle area. Our room was beautiful with a huge bathtub, marble on the floors, granite countertops, a nice sitting room and a very comfy bed. The room was very elegant and classy. The next morning we enjoyed breakfast at The Georgian, the hotel's fine dining restaurant, it is beautiful and elegant, also. The rooms is very spacious and the food wonderful. After some time in Mt. Vernon, we returned to the hotel to relax before a nice dinner at Union, our town car driver was very nice and picked us up and took us to the Space Needle where we enjoyed seeing the city lights at night. Just a quick call and the town car was there within minutes. After a nice breakfast at Cafe Campagne near the market we enjoyed the fitness facilities at the Fairmont, this is a truly gorgeous area with an atrium indoor pool, very spacious jacuzzi, two outdoor decks for relaxing and great weight equipment. We relaxed here for a couple of hours and the front desk was great about giving us an hour extension on our check out. I loved the pool area at this hotel, the housekeeping staff was excellent about keeping the area clean and everything was promptly picked up as guests left the area. Check out went smoothly and our town car driver took us to the Ride the Ducks Tour by the Space Needle, they also were very nice about picking us up after the tour and taking us back to the hotel. This is now one of my favorite hotels to stay in on the West Coast, we will definitely return again and again to this Grand Dame in Seattle.

I checked out the next day scratching my head as to how it is rated a 5-Diamond rated hotel and strongly beliveve based on my stay and room, it is at best a low rated 4 or a high rated 3 Diamond hotel. I was allowed an early check-in, which was much appreciated. Reception had only one staff member working, whom I will say was nice and pleasant. Upon exiting the elevator on my floor, first thing I see is an old dirty styrofoam coffee cup on the table. This raised a \"red flag\" with me immediately. The room itself was a bedroom with separate sitting area. The rate was quite good. Never knew 5-Diamond hotels dropped their rates this low. As for the room, this was where most all of the problems were. A missing blind slat in the sitting room window. Just happened to be the middle slat, so much for keeping the sun out. The slats themselves were filthy and four of the slats had a rust covering on them. The two pillows on the loveseat, one had lipstick stains, the other was dirty with black marks on it. These evidently had not been cleaned in sometime. Found change on the closet floor near the in-room safe. Guess housekeeping did not run a vacuum in there. The loveseat did have arm covers on them, which the chair definitely needed. The arms on the chair were almost black. You can definitely see the dirt against the yellow material of the chair. The desk chair had a sizable dried up blood or chocolate stain all over the seat. Then there was the refreshment area. Three nicely stacked Dean and Deluca candy bars, howerver, one was almost two months past the freshness date. In my opinion, totally unacceptable at any rated hotel. I am still trying to find the ice machines. This is still a big mystery to me. Absolutely no direction nor mention as to where to get ice. After all of this, I was beginning to wonder, what kind of room have I been placed into. The bed was very comfortable, the linens, duvet, pillows, etc, very nice and of quaility I would expect at a hotel of this caliber. The bathroom equally as nice. Although the toilet would not always flush right, would have to take the cover off to fix it, I just put up with it. The amenities in the bathroom were very nice, and the size of the bathroom itself was quite adequate. The towels were not of the highest quality, but they did their job. Room size was fine for me, and really liked being able to open the window to get some fresh air into the room. I did get a laugh though, when I saw the televisions in each room, as I actually own one just like it that is six years old. Now come on Fairmont, we can do better than that. Plenty of cable stations to watch if that is of interest to you. Went to enjoy the pool at the Spa/Fitness center. The young woman at the desk was a delight to meet--very cordial, helpful, willing to please the guest, but way overworked. Enjoyed the pool and hottub, clean, right temperature, and very relaxing. However, the men's locker room was nothing short of a pig sty. All the amenities expected at a 5-Diamond hotel, robes, shaving cream, deoderant, etc., etc., however, they had run out of many of the products. It honestly looked like this locker room had not been touched all day, and this was 5:00 pm. There were not that many people using the fitness center. A very big disappointment to encounter. To top it off, of the hundreds and hundreds of towels in this hotel, I just happen to be given a dirty one. I just laughed, and threw it in the dirty towel bin. I did inform the young lady who was most apologetic. It was not her fault. Utilized the concierege service who was most professional, helpful, and really went out of her way to try and find something of interest for me. Kudo's to her. Room service was outstanding. Food very good, delivered in a timely manner. Laundry service, again, what I would expect. The garments were returned when I was told they would be and in the condition I expected. The shoe shine service was equally as good. My pair of shoes had not looked that good in a very long time. A great job done. Had breakfast in the Georgian Room. Breakfast was very good, but nothing exceptional. Service was adequate, howerver, noticed a few guests did have some wait time before being seated. Did speak to the Manager on Duty regarding the above problems. My complaint was and still is that the Fairmont Olympic is a 5-Diamond rated hotel and naturally is very proud of this rating, but in my case, it sorely did not live up to it. All problems but one were rectified, breakfast was comped, had a nice platter of 5-chocolate covered strawberries delivered to my room while at the fitness center, howerver, no silverwear came with it, lucky to get a napkin I guess. I did check out of that room the next day with that \"old\" candy bar still sitting there. The entrance to the hotel is most inviting, the lobby and Georgian Room were grand, and very comfortable, the hallway looked very fresh. Staff was just adequate, with a few delivering the service expected of this hotel. In my honest opinion, I believe occupancy could be down, and staff has been cut back. Housekeeping Department may be rushed and just not able to tend to the details that should be looked at. That was the major problem, details that separate this hotel from others and especially a 5-Diamond rated one from even a 4-Diamond rated one. Service, cleanliness, and attention to detail very lacking here. It is also the only hotel of this caliber that I had to actually get the front door for myself on two different occasions. One time, there was no one out front. Only saw one bellman at all times while I was there. This hotel cannot live on past laurels and maintain its rating.

You are really close but far away from teh crowds. about a 15 minute walk. I was thinking before booking Fairmount Olympic Hotel to book the Sheraton. But the Sheraton and Westin in Florida really suck and over price for the dumps they own! BUt seeing the Sheraton, I would definitely book the Sheraton. It looks newer, beautifully decorated, really what a new hotel should look like and lots of stagette parties. Convenently located to everything and priced moderately. next time, it will be the Sheraton or the Pan Pacific. by the way valet parking in Seattle is $30 , at the Fairmount its $35. beleive it or not , its much cheaper to the the valet than using the public pay parking where they charge you $11 for a 90 minutes parking. Also everything is Seattle is overpriced to any other big city. It has no real good restaurants and all are over-rated and overpriced. But We did enjoy the TapHouse. Seattle is the most unfriendly City and a dunGY ugly city. I take cruises every year or Royal carribean and Princess and travel to many huge metropolitan cities. Seattle is the bottom of the list for restaurants and thinsg to do. IF your on a budget but still want a nice place, but don't want to pay a fortune but still stay close to Seattle. I would recommend anything in Everett washington that is close to Seattle. a few minutes on the I-5 interstate.

The rooms were small suites with a nice sitting area with a couch, 2 chairs, desk/chair (with a recycle bin, only in Seattle), TV, large closet and dresser. A separate bedroom was equipped with a king size bed, TV, and bathroom. We got to use terrycloth robes, and slippers, and expensive toiletries.

The hotel has four, quite small and quite slow elevators, one or more of which was almost always out of order in the two days we stayed there. Thus, at peak times such as mornings and dinner-time, there was a 5-10 minute wait. And, when the elevator finally did arrive, it was filled, because it only holds 5-6 people, without luggage. With luggage, it's crowded with 3. Our room was disappointing. Knowing that older hotels have a hodgepodge of rooms, many of which are smaller than modern hotels, I didn't expect much. Still the room was VERY small with no view. Queen bed. Only one chair -- thus, one of us had to sit on the bed to watch the very small TV. Of course, because the chair and bed were directly opposite (and the room was too small to move the chair next to the bed), we both could not watch TV at the same time w/o craning our necks. There was almost no place on the floor to put our suitcases and we ended up tripping over them. Room decor was ok -- not memorable -- and bed was comfortable. The A/C worked well and I believe there was a mini-bar (didn't use it). However, the room was so small that we didn't want to do anything there but sleep.

All the usual amenities that you would expect from this class of hotel, but in a more sumptous format: high count cotton bed sheets, robes and slippers in the bathroom, quality toiletries, expensive mini-bar, safe, non-plasma TV, CD player etc. The shower was over the bath (prefer a separate unit) and the bathroom itself a little small, but the large bedroom (had upgraded to an executive room) made up for this. Nice touches like an umbrella in the wardrobe and friendly staff, made the place feel homely. The hotel is looking very slightly tired in some areas, but these large vast traditional places must take some upkeep. Views from the rooms are poor, as the hotel is surrounded by other large buildings on all sides.

PRO: - Best service ever. I all of my stays I have experience only once a slight impatience from a member of the staff. The rest of the time the staff was bending backwards and really doing their very best to honestly try to accommodate - Great location, with nice views. Some of the corner rooms have great views of the river but even the other have very nice views of the surroundings - Magical atmosphere: no matter how difficult the day was, the hotel staff creates a great atmosphere. The little touches like having the bed prepared and the Jazz channel in turned on every evening, the room made twice a day, the music in the hall, etc. - Great gym: quite a few treadmills and similar cardio machines.

If you're absolutely looking for that go to the W across the street. - Expensive, not necessarily overpriced, if you don't have a corporate discount. Word of advice: even though the hotel occupies a whole block, it is often booked well in advance. So make a reservation as soon as you can Also, when you reserve the restaurant through the Concierge, not only do you get great recommendations (they really understand what you are after), but you also get sometimes a free appetizer thrown in courtesy of the Fairmont Concierge, really a great hotel.

One night before the cruise and three nights post cruise. We booked through the AMEX Centurion Card, so we received a number of perks. PROS: Location is ideal for walking about without being in the middle of the fray at Pike Market. There is a great restaurant across the street too, sort of a trendy tapas/wine bar, but the food was wonderful, fairly priced and despite the initial air of pretense they were very welcoming of the five children in our group (including three wee lads). Town car service was handy and freely offered. Food in the Georgian was perfect, really, perfect is the word. From fresh local cherries to the best chicken hash you could imagine the breakfast food was divine. We had room service dinners and the food was equally outstanding. Rooms were on the \"charming\" side, but the furnishings and finishes were first rate, the bed was of the top of the line nature with down comforter, fancy sheets, pillow top mattress. The windows actually open which is a very nice feature in Seattle with the refreshing sea air. The fitness/pool area was a little oasis in the city and hit the spot. But beyond everything else the service in this hotel was as good as the best hotels in Europe or Asia. We were greeted by name throughout our stay, we were \"remembered\" on our return visit a week later. Servers were great with our three small children in the restaurants, not to mention the milk and cookies and toys. The best example was the kitchen fire on the day of our departure (10 guests mind you) that set off the smoke alarms throughout the hotel and put their emergency announcements into action and elevators were turned off for safety. We were on the 4th floor and needed to depart as our shuttle van was at the front door. We called the bell desk and at first were told that they could not come for our bags due to the elevator issue, I then explained our deadline to get to the airport and 4, yes four, bellmen came immediately to our room and brought our bags down 4 flights of stairs with smiles and good spirits. CONS: The Shuckers Restaurant had very slow service, it was almost like the staff there were not on the same channel as the rest of the hotel, I think it may be a concession.

The room didn't contain interesting or original art work. It lacked plants or flowers. The suite had 2 small TVs on push carts. The suite had french doors to the bedroom and they were nice. The closet space was very good and a full ironing board was appreciated. Do not go there on a Sunday or Monday because much of the hotel's dining facilities are shutdown.

Four of us couldn't finish these two dishes. The waiter was very friendly and engaging. The surrounding neighborhood is one of Seattle's nicest.

The staff usually, but not always, treats you amazingly well and no matter who you call or speak to they seem to know your name.

Some flaws include worn carpets and furniture, some service issues such as occasional long delays and confusion with valet parking, and one or two of the doormen are sometimes moody (for example, one friend was treated poorly by a doorman for missing a tip one day, after weeks of giving him and others $5 tips).

It's a perfect location for Christmas shopping, the concierge and front desk staff are top-notch and very helpful. We had reserved an executive suite which was a king bed in one room, and a couch and sitting area in another. We hosted a wine tasting with friends before dinner and a show and the sitting room worked out perfectly. Ordered a wine set up (glasses, etc) and a fruit and cheese platter from in-room dining which made it a bit more special. Delicious selection of cheeses, crackers, grapes, dried fruit and mini-pears came on the tray. Parking at the hotel is $30 a night, room was $180. Bathroom was immaculate - only one bath towel for the two of us but housekeeping quickly fixed things up. Also the dial on the heater/a/c needed adjusting which we let them know at check-out. The hotel is decorated beautifully for the holidays with a huge tree in the lobby. We missed the carolers (they're there between 12-1pm) but we did see the huge gingerbread replica of the hotel. Very cute. We've eaten at both the Georgian Room and Shuckers in the past (good food) but other than the in-room dining this time we ate at Pike's (Cafe Campagne - delicious for brunch - recommend reservations). We also used the fitness facilities in the morning. Heavy chlorine smell from the pool in the cardio area but it's a very nice workout room. We could hear the showers from neighboring rooms in the morning which woke me up. Wish the walls were a little thicker.

Well...I'll start with the good news. You are made to feel welcome from the moment you walk in the door...very friendly staff, people running to open the door, always a smile from anyone you come into contact with. The concierge and the front desk team are also very accomodating. The grand lobby is as I remembered it, and they have perhaps the best gym and pool facility I've seen in a hotel in this country. Wonderful locker room too, full of amenities. All of this is wonderful, but when we stay at a hotel we expect more than just friendly service, particularly at $350 per night! The rooms are, how shall I say it, awful. When we checked in late Friday night, we went into our room and it smelled like mold. It was as if we stepped into a 1970's time warp too...the room was big, but everything about it looked dated and cheap, from the wallpaper to the lighting fixtures. The room was big, but there was almost no furniture in it so it looked kind of ridiculous. We called downstairs and requested to be moved...thankfully, the second room didn't smell, but again everything felt very dated. I felt as though we were paying Four Seasons prices for a Ramada room. All of that said, you can't beat the location and the service (the valet car parkers even leave milk and cookies when they bring your car around for check out!), though we will be trying one of the many other nice hotels in the neighborhood on our next visit...Fairmont, this was a real let-down...get it together in Seattle!", "Date": "October 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, B.C", "Title": "\u201cA little disappointing\u201d", "Author": "MaraThales", "ReviewID": "UR5725856", "Content": "My husband and two children (14/8) stayed here for two nights.

But the kicker was...that they had NO glass in the doors..just sheers...so NO privacy or peace and quiet what so ever. Also, they had two tv's in this small space..one just outside the french doors and one in the bedroom, back to back to the other one. There was no way you could have both tv's going at the same time as the doors offered no sound barrier of course. The overall decor of the hotel was dated and tired looking.

Had a wonderful time based mainly on suggestions from the concierge staff relative to dining and activities. There were only three negatives: We were given a room, which obviously had been a smoking room at one time, as it stunk. The housekeeping staff was most helpful in that they sprayed the room on a regular basis, which assisted greatly with the problem. The second being the stained arm chair and carpet. It would seem an establishment of the Fairmont's stature could afford to completely renovate the room to rid it of the smoky smell permanently and replace the upholstery and carpet. The spa, which is in the same building, was quite a letdown as it was dirty (dust everywhere) and slightly cheesy in that the pedicure consisted of placing one's feet in a plastic tub, as opposed to having a chair with a built-in tub to soak in and when offered a drink, it was water, which had obviously been drawn from the sink and was warm. My point being it was the spa suggested by the staff.
