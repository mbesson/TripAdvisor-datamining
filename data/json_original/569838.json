Now we can say we have no reasons to regret this choice. The hotel is made of two adjacent Georgian townhouses. The conversion must have taken place very recently, because the room itself and everything in it looked brand new. The word \"suite\" is a bit of an overstatement applied to the room we stayed in (suite #10 located at the 1st floor), but it was a fairly large room, containing a very comfortable double bed, a sofa, a low coffee table, a tiny desk with a chair, a tiny wardrobe with coat hangers but no shelves and a tiny \"kitchenette\" in the corner equipped with a sink, a fridge and a microwave. There were also a TV, a safe (which wouldn't open but we didn't need it) a tea kettle with a supply of tea bags, coffee and cookies. There was enough room left to place one or two open suitcases on the floor and still move around quite freely, so I must say we were quite satisfied with the size of the room. Keep in mind that all rooms in this hotel are very different so your mileage may vary. The en-suite bathroom was not large but it definitely was not the smallest I have seen. It contained a wash basin with a \"continental\" style tap, a toilet and a rather large shower cabin equipped with a quality thermostatic water mixer working like a charm. The room was well heated even with a window slightly open for ventilation. There was also a huge and ugly gray box high between the windows that was most probably an air conditioner but we did not need it in January. When leaving a window open for the first night we were a bit afraid of possible noise from the street, but our sleep was never disturbed - the immediate neighbourhood turned out to be rather quiet. Actually, the hotel is ideally located close enough to the King's Cross tube station to reach it in 3 minutes but still far enough to avoid most of the noise of Euston Road. Actually, we heard more noise from within the not-very-sound-proof hotel - doors slamming and so on, but it was not so loud as to disturb our sleep. The self-service continental breakfast was rather small but fresh and quite edible. On our arrival the room and bathroon were immaculate, the subsequent daily cleaning was a bit superficial but still ok. To summarize: the best points of this hotel are its very convenient location (for a visitor who is going to use the tube a lot) and larger-than-average rooms. Another advantage for today is the hotel's brand new condition, but unfortunately this sort of things may not last very long. The weakest point is the not so good sound-proofing - it turned out ok for us but may appear unacceptable to someone with lower-than-average noise tolerance.", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Inn & Suites Kings Cross", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d569838-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Suites_Kings_Cross-London_England.html", "Price": "$205 - $378*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">31-33 Argyle St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">WC1H 8EP</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "569838", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/90/a4/14/1-bed-apartment.jpg"}}
