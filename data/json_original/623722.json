And be careful, when we were checking out they tried charging us for someone else's room service, even though it was two completely different names on the bill.

We were pleasantly surprised that, despite paying such a low price, we had a wonderful, relaxing stay. I like that we had a balcony, a clean and very large room, a beautiful and clean bathroom, and that huge pool. It was always warm and we even went swimming in the evening (even though it closes around 8 PM). Somedays, when we were so relaxed we didn't want to leave the room, we would call in for room service, and it would be delievered within 20 minutes. The breakfast was....okay. I mean, it was free and fresh, but the same thing every day (which affects you when they don't have a huge selection). The Italian restaurant that is in the hotel isn't that great, but on the other hand, just outside the hotel there are some fabulous choices for restaurants. I also really love that, the minute you step outside the back of the hotel, there is an AMAZING beach! This hotel caters to you so much - my only problem throughout my stay there was whether to spend time at their fabulous pool or the fabulous beach! It is in Kuta, which initially made me a bit apprehensive, but it is on the border of Legian - and walking distance to all those great rows of shops. This is a winner of a hotel - even though you pay so little, you do not sacrifice any of the luxury of a more expensive hotel.

Both bathrooms were full of mould and the mirrors deteriating and a generally scungy smell in both rooms, towels were very sad but our sheets were good. In the childrens rooms the walls were filfthy I asked for them to be cleaned on arrival they wiped it over which did nothing, curtains ripped chipped walls and very tired indeed, I requested other rooms but the hotel was full. The balconies were a treat listening to the pounding surf and bird life with the very lovelly gardens, room service was very good and the beds were the hard type's but we are ok with that. Breakfast was great the music was a bit loud for me and I love balinese music. Lots of expensive resaurants along the beach compared to other places we have stayed however the food was great, the beach was also very relaxing in one day I was asked by 20 people to buy stuff but they didnt hassle me except the little kids one who swore at us as well we were very polite to him(what a shame eh)The beach guys were very fun and our children loved the swimming pools as we did, lots of aussies with families whilst school hols was on. We decided we loved staying in poppies lane 1 better for location and eating but thats just us. Staff were great but the hotel couldnt do any of the famous cocktails for lack of alcahol with the muslim festival I was disapointed in general but can understand the appeal to many others of this hotel, a bit of paint and elbow grease would make a difference.

It is a little unfortunate that the overflow from the adjacent Jayakarta Hotel has found the idyllic Kumala Pantai.

Over the years we have stayed at the hotel, the breakfast buffet has not changed at all - but it really is quite delicious and the fruit buffet is wonderful. I love the KP and will keep on going back- this year I will be interested to see the major renovations that will have added a large number of rooms plus a pool with a swim up bar - I hope that this will not mean that the quiet and tranquil Kumala Pantai will not become just another haunt for the Aussie yobbo who seems to be found all over this beautiful island. We stayed at the Jayakarta but were put off by the noisey people drinking and partying on the balconies of rooms - hope that the KP maintains its standards. Apparently thr breakfast area is going to have to accommodate the increased rooms this year - good luck!", "Date": "Feb 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR202650218", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Regicia"}, {"Content": "Great stay at kumala       The pool", "Date": "Feb 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR584700794", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "urbanmike"}, {"Content": "favourite hotel I have been to bali 25 times the last 5 at the kumala pantai,as an all round experience I love the kumala pantai.Location,room ( especially the ambassador suite),pool ,food and especially the staff are are excellent.that end of town is not as frantic as kuta and the eating in the vicinity is great.Any problems talk to the beautiful Desi in reception and presto they are fixed.Paul Williams Perth", "Date": "Jan 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR397960062", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PerthSandgroper"}, {"Content": "Nice Budget Hotel -January 2008       Bathroom", "Date": "Jan 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR374050882", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "bitterpumpkins"}, {"Content": "Hard Bed - Hot Room We were disappointed with the Kumala PantaiWhilst the room size was great, and a bonus to have two showers, the beds were rock hard.

Just got back from bali last week.im a food lover, i must say Kumala Pantai exceeds my expectation.the room is OK, for the price you pay, its a bit outdated and it has a komodo dragon on the wall (kind of scarry at night after partyin). the hotel is nice in some way, its green, lush, n because of the 3 floor buliding blocks around the hotel, it gets shady in the day time, but its nice. the pool are in the front of the hotel, so you wont get a breezy pool lounging. Location is Great, for an adult this area is the perfect location to be, from day to dawn. next door to famous beach cafes and clubs, also a bit walk to legendary double six club. what not to love kumala pantai. The Best Part is.. The Breakfast.. yes it is. every morning, breakfast with beach views. Excellent breakfast ever yet in my life. sippin the coffee, watch the waves breaks, seeing the local peoples doing their things; setting up their business for the day (surfboard rental, etc) after the bfast closed, it began changin to an italian rest. i think it called the sands, i guess.. great food too. i actually not a breakfast person, but when you stay in Kumala Pantai, dont miss the breakfast. sometime the tables on the beach side is full. wake up early.", "Date": "Jun 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR926990142", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "frozzty"}, {"Content": "Great Beach front hotel Excellent rooms with marble bathroom Ambassador (2 bedroom) suite was fantastic for us  friends.

The hotel is a short 15 minute drive from the airport (depending on traffic).Service at the front desk was satisfactory. We managed to get the room at the block we requested for (more on this later).We had a deluxe room (the cheapest at USD42 per night) which was well appointed and clean. The room had a TV set with more than 20 channels (CNN, BBC, HBO etc), an in-room safe, a balcony (though not much of a view). The attached bath had separate bath and shower facilities, a rarity for hotels of this range.Two issues bugged us on our first night. We discovered soon after that the digital in-room safe was locked. The hotel sent someone up shortly after a quick phone call and he opened it with a key after dismantling a panel on the safe. This was a little disconcerting as we were always under the impression that hotel staff wouldn't be able to open such safes so easily. We then followed the instructions (really carefully) to set a combination, but that failed to work. So we gave up. We were not going to spend precious holiday time fretting over a room safe - ended up leaving our passports and home currency in the safe deposit box provided free of charge at the front desk. The other lapse was the failure of the hotel to provide us with an adapter for our phone/camera chargers. Perhaps we are spoilt but we had never encountered any such problem in all our previous trips.Now that the minor lapses are out of the way, I have to say this is one fantastic hotel. The pool is a nice size and very well maintained, as was the hotel grounds. Beautiful Balinese sculptures are around every corner amid lush trees and foliage. Friendly smiles were on all the staff's faces.The hotel is divided into several blocks. The NS block (where we stayed) is the one closest to the beach. The A block is between NS and the pool, though you won't get any pool view due to the way the block is angled.The selection at breakfast was rather limited. There was an egg station, and about six other items plus breads, cereals and fruits. The six items varied a little over the four breakfasts we had, but it got a little bit tiring by the fourth day. Breakfast was served daily at the Ristorante Italia, a restaurant within the hotel premises that overlooks the (marvellous!) beach.One major factor for us choosing this hotel is its location. Its beach front entrance faces a beautiful stretch of Legian Beach. The same entrance is less than 50 metres from famous restaurants like Blue Ocean and Zanzibar. It is also 10 minutes away from the bustling Kuta where all the shopping and dining were to be had. A ride on the (ubiquitous) taxi to central Kuta costs only about Rp25,000. Also nearby were the more up-market nightlife and restaurants in Seminyak.You can rent deck chairs for the entire day at the beach right outside the hotel for a mere Rp40,000. Perfect for working on that tan and gazing at the magnificent sunset only Bali can offer.We requested for a late check-out on our last day as our departure flight was at 7:40pm. The rule is that you have to pay half of the daily rate if you want to check out by 6pm, about USD21 in our case. Still really inexpensive and it allowed us more time to savour our last moments on this beautiful island.Overall a real bargain for the wonderful amenities and service. We had a chance to sneak a peek at our friends' room at the Legian Beach Resort. It was smaller and more expensive (at USD88 a night). Fantastic value at the Kumala Pantai if there ever was one.
