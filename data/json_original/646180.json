We were in a one bedroom condo on the upper floor with a fantastic few. The deck and living room provided ample space for relaxation. Having two full bathrooms was not necessary, but a nice plus. The kitchenette was perfectly adequate for cooking breakfast, though I can't imagine cooking a decent dinner there. Only the most basic utensils/dishes/cookware are available in the room. Mattresses and linens could stand to be upgraded. Lighting was a bit dim and made reading at night challenging. Hotel does not serve breakfast or lunch. Dinner is expensive, but good.

If you were to book a wedding at this place, I highly recommend the Sons of Culebra band - they were the best - very entertaining - great music - they hardly took any breaks..and they joined in on the festivities.

The reception area where dancing was held has a magnificent view of the ocean and the sky ....cool breezes....very romantic...especially during a starry night. I ordered breakfast for everyone day after wedding. I highly recommend you request for this - after all the festivities, your guests will be hungry the next morning.

Jose who was in charge of managing the food and beverage and alcohol part of the party is a very honest and personable young man. I was impressed. You know you're in good hands. Lisa did an excellent job putting the wedding together - coordinating each event so that it flowed very smoothly. Flower arrangements were exactly to the bride's requirement.

It is still a great place to stay, but there is great variability in the units. At first, we got a first floor unit instead of the second floor we had been promised, but Nelly, as usual, made it right and we were switched to the second floor when it became available. It was better taken care of (C-201) and the air conditioners did not make the jet engine noise we encountered in the first unit. Little things, like rust around exposed pipes and poor quality room towels in all units (beach towels are good quality though) detract from the living quarters, but balconies overlooking the water make up for a lot. As before, all the personnel were friendly and helpful. None of the restaurants on the island would rate \"excellent,\" by U.S. major city standards, but surprisingly, the Bahia Marina restaurant was as good as any (if the young chef is cooking that night) and we had a couple of very nice meals (contrary to the website, both years we've been there, there was only one restaurant open at Bahia, with the swim up bar food on the weekend). Zaco's Tacos is a laid back very casual restaurant (he closes early, so check the hours), but the creative tacos are very good and it makes fro a very reasonably priced meal, with good drinks!! Carlos Jeep rental is the major car renter, and not cheap, but they deliver on quality and vehicle condition. You need a car to visit the outer beaches (Zoni being the best) and you can usually rent beach chairs (not great quality but better than nothing) and snorkels in town right near the bridge. Don't come to Culebra if you are looking for luxury, or lots to buy (maybe a tee shirt) or great night life. But for a relxing vacation, reasonable cost, and a beautiful secluded beach experience (Flamenco is overrated), can't beat it. We flew into the San Juan Int. airport, took a taxi for lunch to Old San Juan, then took a flight from the nearby Isla Grande Airport (we got into San Juan at 1:11, and the Air Flamenco flight was not until 4:30).

After a wonderful experience in 2010 staying at the Casita Tropical on the island, we decided to return for our destination wedding in November of 2011. We started planning in May of 2011 and found Bahia Marina to be one of the 2 locations that could potentially accommodate over 100 people for our wedding, and the only one that got back to us in a timely manner. Deposits were placed successfully to hold our date and outside supplies that were needed from additional vendors in San Juan. Lisa and Nelly were my two contacts at the resort and were both phenomenal. Lisa coordinated all of the outside vendors, from having flowers flown in from San Juan, to the local band on our wedding night and even a group of local conga drum players for our ceremony. Negotiations took place via email, phone, and emailed pictures and although at some points as a stressed bride I felt like things were not moving fast enough, I was comforted by Nelly that everything was on track. The food was awesome at the wedding and every night leading up to the wedding. As our guests took over the entire resort almost every night the tables were filled with our family and friends and we heard rave reviews! The waitstaff was very nice and the bartenders were fantastic as well. Fresh lobster and fish were an option every night and one of my family members was even invited on a personal boat ride with Jose and Jose Jr. (the owners) to Vieques to collect fresh seafood for the wedding. Lisa was able to recommend a (the only!) local baker to make our wedding cake, a delicious 4 layer cake. Peri @ The Homeless Dog Cafe. She also runs a late night food menu which some of our guests used from 2pm to 2am! You can find her on FB. The facilities at the Bahia Marina were perfect for our 75 person wedding. We had our cocktail hour at the upper pool deck and the Shipwreck Bar and Grill so that our guests were able to see the sunset from high above the bay. After cocktails and appetizers, which we missed, but the guests raved about, all the guests processed down to the lower pool deck, Cayo Pool Deck, for the reception. The tables, candles, flowers, drinks, food, and music was awesome and totally us. The staff was very attentive and yet relaxed, so when every single guest jumped into the pool with dresses & drinks, even the bride and groom, the management was more than OK with it. **I say totally us, because we are very casual people, and we have traveled around the world staying in hostels and camping, enjoying non touristy areas. We are not turned off by the island charm of the occasional chipped paint, or broken deck wood. If you are looking for the Hilton this is probably not the place for you, but if you are into Island charm, beautiful landscapes, and very friendly local staff you'll love it.** Although we did not stay at the Resort, the bridal party stayed at Villa Pellicano, our guests said that the rooms were clean and modern, with everything that you could need. My mother had a wonderful room with a great side deck and two bedrooms and was able to share a deck area with my husbands parents in a close room, which was perfect. Planned by Nelly! Air conditioning was cold & the rooms had TV's and a kitchen. Most of our guests bought supplies from the local grocery store for breakfast in their rooms, so nice to have this amenity, as the Bahia Marina did not offer regular breakfasts every morning. That being said, as part of our arrangement with the resort we hosted a full breakfast for all of our guests in the Dakiti Restaurant on the morning after the wedding. This was delicious and included eggs, bacon, pastries, fruit, coffee, etc... If you are planning and event there I would highly recommend this option! Overall the process of planning a destination wedding can be trying at times but Nelly and Lisa really looked at every step of the process. Our ceremony on Flamenco Beach was something out of a postcard. Bahia Marina secured the beach on a busy Saturday, set up chairs for 75 people, and also produced a tropical flower decorated \"Bohio\" canopy. As we are younger and wanted to be closer to town, we did not stay at the resort. But it did seems to be perfect for some of the older people in our party that wanted the luxury of the 2 pools, and bar, and restaurants on the property. It was also prefect for our friends that were traveling with children, for the 2 bedroom units, and pools. The swim up bar at Cayo Pool Deck also offered us the BEST fish sandwich on the island! Looking back on our wedding at the Bahia Marina we wouldn't have done anything different! And thanks to the very attentive staff, the occasional changes that were made in the days leading up to the wedding were taken care of right away. We both look forward to returning to Culebra yet again, and a Bushwacker and dinner at the Shipwreck bar and grill with be on our agenda! Thank you Bahia Marina for making our 2nd time to Culebra so wonderful, and for making our wedding truly magical. *Rehearsal Dinner - Club Seabourne *Ceremony - Flamenco Beach *Cocktail Reception - Upper Pool Deck/Shipwreck Bar & Grill Bahia Marina *Wedding Reception - Cayo Pool Deck Bahia Marina", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cIck!\u201d", "Author": "Kate D", "ReviewID": "UR123659172", "Content": "We recently stayed here based on Tripadvisor reviews, and were very disappointed.

We had two bathrooms, in 1 the shower didn't work too well but for the price no big deal it was just two of us. We ate at the restaurant 1 night had the churrasco mofongo and grilled chicken they were both OUTSTANDING, pricing was fair, all around the island nothing was \"cheap\" as we had come to learn it was difficult for locals to get food consistently coming in so cost was passed on to customers. Bahia Staff was very helpful, they even supplied us with a free cooler & towels before we ventured to the gorgeous Flamenco Beach one morning. On our last night the glass shelf in 1 of the bathrooms accidently came off the wall mount and shattered all over the floor. Within 3 minutes the front desk came to clean it up, & we weren't charged for it, that is great customer service and worth mentioning! Didn't try the pool it looked nice and clean, but with all the beaches on the island doesn't appear that its used much. Plan on being in bed fairly early, NOTHING on this island really stays open late, by that I mean we were asleep by 11 each night. Make sure to find Captain Bill for a day of snorkeling/sightseeing he will be reviewed seperately. If you are planning on staying a few days rent a jeep from ripoff Carlos Jeep, there really are no rental car places but him on the island (at least till I retire:) so your stuck, but you can't rely on taxis if you want to venture & explore you need a jeep. Be aware though with 1 gas station on the island open maybe 6 hrs a day it will be difficult to refill that jeep before you return it, so carlos can overcharge you for gas he's got a great scam going. Very few concerns overall, I would suggest as others have on TA some better sheets for the bed, maybe a new mattress and please two more pillows, some couples prefer more than 2 pillows on the bed. Other than that if you are looking for 5 star white glove accomodations may I suggest the \"W\" resort on vieques for $700 a night, Culebra is a small simple island and in my opinion Bahia fits the bill hotel wise at a reasonable price and comfortably aims to please at a layed back island pace to meet your needs for a toned down/quiet/calm getaway...", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yosemite National Park, California", "Title": "\u201cCulebra!\u201d", "Author": "Scott J", "ReviewID": "UR122056078", "Content": "Stayed for a week as part of a wedding and loved it.

The ferry ride was roughly an hour and a half. Once we arrived on Culebra, we waited at Banco Popular and called the hotel like instructed. We called a dozen times and kept getting a busy signal, we even considered walking but it would be a 40 minute walk with 3 kids, it wasn't happening, then about 20 minutes later a bus finally shows up. We checked in and got a room by the restaurant. The minute you walked in room, there was a strong smell of urine. We did a little investigation to see where that smell was coming from, and someone apparently had too much fun and didn't make it to either restrooms and decided to pee on the wall by the bedroom. The only way to escape the strong urine smell is to go out on the balcony, which by the way had a beautiful view of the ocean and mountains. The suite had a kitchen, living room with a futon, 2 restrooms and 2 double beds. The hotel does not offer transportation to and from the beach like some of the other hotels. Depending on which taxi service you call, it's $5 a person/ each way, to Flemenco beach. There are shuttle buses when you get off the ferry that charges $3 to the beach. We ended up spending about $80 just in taxi service to and from the beach and the hotel. I'm sure we could have rented a jeep for that much. I wished the number 1 rated hotel on Culebra would offer their guests transportation to the beach. That is the reason why most people go to Culebra, is for the beach and for them to not offer it is just not right. The restaurant was good but over priced.

She went way beyond call of duty to helping us to check out/recommend hotels, reserve table at a restaurant, book trips etc etc! To bad I did not got to meet her (she was at the mainland) to thank her for all the help!! First things first, Culebra is a small island but it is truly beautiful! The pace is slow , so if you are after a party this might not be the place for you. This is the place for outdoor activities like snorkeling, fishing and laying on one of the many great beaches. It is very restful! We loved the Bahia Marina! The view from our room was spectacular! It was so great it was a joy being jet-lagged just to be able to enjoy the view even at night! Our room was very clean and had a kitchen , two bathrooms, a living room and balcony. My only concerned was that the kitchen had to few cooking utilities (I caught fish every day that I cooked) and that the frying pan\u00c2\u00b4s bottom wasn't flat , making frying a bit hard. The AC was working perfectly (both of them) which had been a concern , since I am very heat sensitive. The service was great , the front desk helped to set up trips/outings, calls to confirm things and so on! The Bahia Marina has two pool areas if one would like to stay close to the hotel ,that are clean and close to the bars (one is a swim in bar). A transport service to and from the airport is complimentary and if there are plenty of taxis if you like to get around or you can rent a car. The Shipwreck Restaurant are located here and the food was very,very good (we only ate sea food). The place is 2,4 km from what is supposed to be be the town but it did not bother us! I would also advise any visitor to book a trip with Captain Bill (that is associated with this hotel). If You love fishing (which is my vice) he is your man on this island! And if you want any combination that involves a boat, he and his catamaran is the choice! I will write a separate review on his service , if you are interested.

We wanted to tour the BVI but when reading reviews and looking at pictures we noticed that Culebra was a worth while stop on the trip. After figuring out how to get to Culebra from Tortola (id be happy to answer any questions on how we accomplished this) we decided to stay at the Bahia Marina Condo Hotel. Without the ability to select half points I figured with the package considered as a whole the Hotel was worth 4 stars. The staff is most certainly very helpful. We were settling on our house in the states when we were on vacation and the staff gratefully printed out all of our documents and faxed them for us. Since we got to the island on a weekday, they recommended sites and attractions to see to keep us busy. The island is pretty dead through the week so having your own transportation is definitely helpful. The Bahia Marina is also too far for a \"long walk on the beach\" back from dinner. Im not sure exactly but it is probably 2 or 3 miles from MamaCitas ( which is definitely worth the trip ). The room that we stayed in did have a nice view of the bay but the room was about average and a bit overpriced. The beds were definitely sub par and the ac wasn't very cold. Overall I would recommend the Bahia Marina to someone traveling to Culebra, but when we go back we will most likely stay at a house.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Juan, Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cMini Vacations\u201d", "Author": "Fernando Q", "ReviewID": "UR121472684", "Content": "Comfortable well equiped Villas.

I have stayed on Culebra many times and often rent a house for my stay. The BMCH is in a good location on the island close to town (Dewey) but far enough and up high on a hill such that it is reasonably quiet at night. The staff was extremely nice and because if this i am not disappointed in the value to cost ratio. My room was located with a spectacular view of the bay (facing north) and was very clean. That is to say, the room itself was clean including the bathrooms and kitchen. However, the walls were filthy and appeared to be painted by a 9 year old. i.e. i could have done a better job and i suck at painting. The furniture is just ok. it works but you are not going to be shopping for similar styles when you get home. the TV is a flat screen but very small, perhaps 19 inches, but i didn't spend much time watching it anyway because, after all, you're in Culebra for pete sake! All the kitchen appliances were in good repair and worked well. And as previously stated, the kitchen was very clean and came with pots/pans/utensils to use on your microwave/stove top. This is nice because, at the very least, you can save time and $$ making your own breakfast and packing a lunch for the beach, there by only needing to buy dinner if you don't feel like cooking. Which you won't. (you're on vacation, for pete sake! live it up!) The bed was reasonably comfortable and the sheets were clean. I prefer a higher thread count and have better sheets on my bed at home, but they were acceptable. All in all, i like this hotel. If they simply painted the place (using professional painters this time) and maybe put better sheets on the bed i would give them a whole star more on my rating. I know, i know, it sounds petty but i'm just being honest here. Don't hesitate to stay here. I've stayed in a lot of houses on Culebra that were a whole lot worse for about the same price. Don't leave the island without calling Willie's Water Taxi (787-449-0580) for a day trip over to Culebrita! Trust me on this one!

Romantic, magical, serene, beautiful.............. Our stay at the Bahia Marina was perfect. Jose and the staff were warm and friendly. And Nelly, I cannot express how much we appreciate all that she did for us. She helped us with our flight from San Juan, added personal touches to our room in recognition of our anniversary, set up a special dinner for us on the deck of the upper pool the evening after we renewed our vows........etc. But it was her warmth and genuine kindess that we appreciated most. She is truly a beautiful lady inside and out. The rooms and hotel grounds are clean and neat, and the views are incredible. We stayed in the 2 bedroom condo and while it was just the 2 of us it was nice to have the extra room to throw all my fly fishing stuff in. The view from this room is more of a mountain view with Dakity visible to the left while on the deck. While my wife typically enjoys a water view during her early morning reading time, she found the view to be beautiful and peaceful. The Shipwreck Bar and Grill is terrific and every meal was better than the last. The atmosphere was perfect for us as we are not in the wild nightlife crowd (anymore) but for good drinks and conversation, excellent. The trip to Culebrita with Captain Bill and GiGI is the greatest. Hiking, snokeling, swimming, seaturtles, and fine dining on the Pez Vela are all a part of the trip and Captain Bill is a heck of a good guy. This is a must do.

We visited 6 days and loved our visit. Our 2 bedroom unit at Bahia Marina CondoHotel was not what we expected , however, and was disappointing to us. Here is what we liked best about the hotel: Shipwreck Bar is very attractive, ate 3 dinners there and the food was mostly excellent; used the lower swimming pool and found it beautiful, and very refreshing; housekeepers did a nice job of cleaning our unit each day., the beds were very comfortable, a washer and dryer in the unit, and the hotel van picked us up soon after arrival at the airport, and kindly stopped at the grocery store on the way to the hotel. And here are the features we liked least: there was no direct ocean view from our unit! I almost cried after being shown our third floor unit. Our view , overlooked the pool, and hills, covered in bushes.The was a wedge of the ocean if we looked over the adjacent balcony, it was not an unpleasant view, but extremely disappointing when we were looking forward to a view of the ocean. The balcony was in full sun most of the day, and had tattered plastic uncomfortable chairs so we did not use the balcony. We had two bedrooms, and all the windows looked directly into the adjacent unit. So, we kept the shades down at all times. The unit was dark and un-inviting. There was sparse and uncomfortable furnishings. In the living room was an armless futon, 2 ottomans, 4 barstools, and a TV. No tables at all. We asked for more chairs, and 2 patio chairs were brought immediately, which we appreciated. When on vacation, we usually love to spend a portion of each day in our unit, reading, playing games, enjoying the ambiance. We spent very little time in our unit at Bahia Marina. Another feature that was unexpected and disappointing, was that the nearest beach was not an easy walk from the hotel. Soldier Beach is a difficult 30 min walk on an unshaded, hilly ,rough road. We love to take walks, but found that from Bahia Marina ,walking was a challenge. And finally, another feature of the hotel that was disappointing, was expecting that there were 3 restaurants. While we were there, one restaurant was available for dinner each night, and the pool bar served food fro 12-4 on the weekend.. We were told that Dakiti is open when the Shipwreck bar is full, and that they both have the same menu. We had dinner at the Shipwreck Grill 3 nights, and it was mostly delicious.

Found Bahia Marina through Tripadvisor, and the rave reviews were on the money. It is a 3 by 7 mile island, everywhere you want to go is a short ride, and Bahia is up on a hill overlooking the bay and the rest of the island (depending on your unit), a short ride out of the only \"downtown\", such as it is- a few restaruants, a few adequate \"supermarkets\", and a single gasoline pump station at the marina. Rented a small Suzuki sedan, which was fine for getting to all but one beach (didn't miss anything by not having access to that beach, which is at the end of the road off of which you take a left to go into Bahia Marina). The view from our balcony was lovely, kitchenette was fine (made ice from bottled water- nice top freezer, bottom refrigerator) and didn't cook, but could have. The Bahia's \"fancy\" restaurant was closed, but the bar restaurant was open every night, and surprisingly, the food was as good as any of the other restaruants that we liked in town. Don't expect a very good restaurant on the island, by major city standards, but Suzie's was close. Mamacita's was disappointing (maybe not to the drinking crowd). Had an excellent caesar salad and excellent pizza at Heather's, which had recently opened. I expect that Heather's will outgrow its small space quickly. El Eden had good food, but is a grocery store setting also (paid $5 more there for a bottle of sapphire gin than it was at Milka's grocery (unfortunately didn't go there first), which is across the street from El Eden, and looks like a rundown shack, but has everything you'll need and is fine to buy food goods there. There is also a supermarket across from the airport (one market out of milk- go to the other). Flamenco is a fine beach, but is more populated than the others (none are even remotely \"crowded\"). You can walk from its parking lot (a healthy 1/2 hr. hike) to Carlos Rosario, which is nice for snorkeling, but there is another beach you can drive to on the way to, but before you get to (you turn left) Flamenco that has very good snorkleling, but not much sand. Overall, driving to the east end of the island to Zoni Beach was well worth the effort- gorgeous wide sand and views of the other islands (but no facilities, so pack food, and bring a small cooler with you). We rented nice beach chairs in town, where you can also rent snorkel gear- very nice people (also rent bikes there). We flew Air Flamenco from Isla Grande airport. Took cab from the San Juan International airport to a hotel that is less than a 1 mile from Isla Grande, and grabbed a bite, since the connections didn't allow more time to go to Old San Juan between flights- cab driver tried to charge as much for the ride fromt he hotel to Isla Grande as the ride was from the Int. airport, to the hotel, which had been a 15 minute ride-ask before you get in! Culebra is a sleepy island with beautiful beaches, and not much else going on. If you are looking to just relax, you could stay at Bahia Marina, go to Zoni, each at Bahia Marina and have night caps at the bar there (very nice people) and have a great vacation.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alexandria, VA", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay on Island of Culebra\u201d", "Author": "LaRee", "ReviewID": "UR98571922", "Content": "Bahia Marina was a great place to stay.

The unit I stayed in had a gorgeous view of Fulladoza bay and with the slider open the breeze cooled off things beautifully. The kitchen appliances seemed fairly new - refrigerator, microwave and two burner stovetop. There was also a toaster and coffeemaker. There were few pots and pans but I believe the management will provide what you need if you ask. I chose to cook breakfast each morning and eat it on the balcony which was a delightful way to start the day. My unit was very clean upon arrival and stayed that way. The bathrooms were scrubbed each day, the towels changed, and the beds made. I left my dishes rinsed in the sink thinking I would do them later and when I returned they were washed and put away. The view is spectacular here and being up on the hillside they get a wonderful breeze. I only turned on the air conditioning at night because the bedroom was a little stuffy being in the back of the unit without much ventilation. Unlike the previous reviewer, I had no trouble accessing the wifi at the resort in my unit. It was slow at times but certainly useable. I checked email each day and kept in touch with work and family without any problem. When it came time to print my boarding pass the front office was happy to do that for me. Even though it says in the literature that each room has a dvd player mine did not. It wasn't a problem for me as i had a laptop but if that's important to you you should check. The office has a small collection of dvds to loan if you want to watch one some evening. They also have a small assortment of paperback books if you need something to read. The pools were very well maintained - always clean and plenty of seating. It's a very relaxing place to hang out if you don't want to go to the beach, or even later in the afternoon. I ate at both the Shipwreck Bar and Grill and the Cayo Pool. Both served good food and drinks. I agree that if you stay here you will want some kind of transportation. The resort will bring you to and from the airport but they are a long way from town and beaches so you will want a jeep, car, or scooter. I rented a scooter and had a wonderful time buzzing around. I found the potholes in the road easy to avoid on the scooter - you just have to drive carefully and pay attention. It was easy to get to town for supplies, the beaches, and even out to a restaurant at night. I found eveyone on Culebra friendly and easy going. The best thing about Bahia Marina is the staff. Nelly is just plain wonderful and will do whatever she can to help you. I even got a big hug when I left! The folks in the bar always greet you as you come through and ask how your day is going. The waitstaff always have a smile and are very efficient and helpful. No complaints about anyone at all. Would I come back?

We stocked up the fridge (full-sized, not a dinky dorm fridge) so we could have quick and easy breakfasts and lunches on the fly, and we ate delicious Caribbean food in the hotel restaurant at night. The hotel sits atop a hill, with stunning views of the bay and to the ocean. We drove our jeep down to the beach the first time, but realized that it was much closer than we thought, so after that we enjoyed the beautiful walk. Take your camera with you! The snorkeling at that beach was great (I saw my first cowfish!), and we mostly had the beach to ourselves. There is lots to see and do on Culebra, and the super-friendly staff is happy to point you in the right direction.

When we arrived the room was clean except the coffee pot was black, silverware tray was filthy and dishes had hard food on them. Not a big deal, I just cleaned it myself. This is a great property but could be so much better with a few touches and follow up on their housekeeping staff. The blue couches/futon need to be replaced. They are more for a dorm room and were very uncomfortable to sit on. The kitchen was very poorly stocked but when I took a list to Nelly she got us everything we needed! But somemone should have walked through too see there was only one fork, one knife, one glass and a frying pan not fit for salvation army. The people who stayed above us said their TV didn't work well and their condo was also very poorly stocked. The pillows were thick and hard so I didn't use a pillow. Housekeeping only replaced towels. We had to sweep the floors ourselves. We always did our own dishes but one morning we left a pan and of course it was still dirty when we got back from the beach. The pools are great but don't let your kids go barefoot because the decks are very warped and they'll get splinters! The other bumber is no grilling is allowed. If you can't do stairs don't stay in the two bedroom because it's a steep flight of stairs up to the restaurant and upper pool and a steep flight down to the newer pool. One last thing I thought the condos were new but couldn't have been because the knobs on the kitchen cabinets were rusted, paint was peeling off the walls, there were big cracks in the walls and mold in the shower where the water stands. Lastly, unless you are in fantastic shape, the walk to the beach is much much more than a 15 minute walk and you have to go up a huge hill. You definately need a jeep.

Unfortunately due to Hurricane Earl, getting to Culebra from San Juan was a nightmare but we eventually made it and the minute we drove up to the Bahia (in our jeep rented from Carlos) and met the unbelievably wonderful people there, all the stress became well worth it.

Everyone, from the girl at the check in desk to Allie the bartender (who made us excellent mojitos at the bar next to the check in window), to Jose Jr., Jorge and Amanda the staff who served us our scrumptious dinner the next night, every single person was so wonderfully warm and hospitable that the Bahia felt like home within the hour.

Another must-do is sailing with Captain Bill (you can book thru the hotel).

No fixed agenda, just relaxing and fun and an overall incredible experience. In all, I cannot say enough good things about Bahia Marina and especially its people.

The ceiling in the bedroom was also leaking.....all over the beds. You would think they would apologize or in the least offer to get us a new room. We actually had to ask them to move us (so that my grandmother would not have to sleep on a wet bed). Cleanliness: The bathrooms looked dirty. The tiled floor had grime buildup and the toilets and sinks could use a good scrub. While laying in the uncomfortable beds, you had to stare up at a stained and peeling ceiling. The rooms were NOT cleaned while we were there. Our choices were to either sweep and clean the room ourselves, or stay in a dirty room. We chose to clean it ourselves. Also, there were 4 people in our room and we were only given 2 towels.....did they think we were going to share bath towels??? Food: The food was extremely overpriced (between 24-32 dollars a plate). For that much money, I would expect a great meal. My mother and I decided to share the meal to cut down on cost. is not what we got. We ordered the Mofongo w/ churrasco. Mofongo is a typical Puerto Rican dish made from fried mashed plantains. The waitress said they were out of plantains, but made a Mofongo out of yuca (root veg.). What I was served was a ball of tasteless yuca in the form of mashed potatoes that had absolutely NO FLAVOR. The meat was INEDIBLE....tough and tasted horrible. Others at my table tasted it an agreed. I wasn't going to say anything to the staff, but the waitress asked. She wanted to know why we did not the meal. When we expressed our dissatisfaction with the meal, she just shrugged it off and walked away. When we got the bill, the horrible uneaten meal was not taken off. We had to pay for bad food we could not eat! Rooms: Not enough towels, Not cleaned daily, Uncomfortable beds and HORRIBLE futon, NO iron, No hair dryer...At least there was HBO to have something to look at other than all the room flaws!

In addition to the exceptional staff, the accommodations were simply perfect - clean, comfortable, modern and spacious. The bedrooms had nice firm beds. The kitchen was perfectly equipped for cooking (though why cook when the hotel has a delicious restaurant and a group of great bartenders?). The marble bathrooms were spotless. And our balcony view was spectacular - overlooking one of the hotel's beautiful pools and facing some of the island's verdant landscape as well as one of its deep blue bays. In other words, it was breathtaking. And at night it was magical to sit on the balcony; hear and feel nothing but the island breeze; and gaze into the shimmering night sky - so many stars!

We booked our stay based on the reviews on TripAdvisor, which we have used almost exclusively for recommendations on hotels for the last five years all across Europe and the Caribbean, probably amounting to at least 20 or so different hotels. Our taste in hotels is typically the off-the-beaten-path, boutique, hidden gem types. We are not resort dwellers by any stretch. In all this time, the TripAdvisor reviews have never steered us wrong. That is, until now. I believe the Bahia Marina rooms are individually owned (I could be wrong), which might explain why the rooms are hit or miss. We checked in and were given room B101. Let me be clear\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..if you are given room B101, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even bother looking. Ask for a new room. We do not require luxury, but we do require cleanliness and B101 is not clean and it is not comfortable. From the first minute the door was opened for us, we smelled the (sour? mildewy? just old?) room. The room is worn and tired and, with the exception of the relatively new kitchen appliances, needs much more than the cursory, quick once-over cleaning it must have been getting over the months or years. The floors were dirty, there were white stains on one of the maroon comforters in the bedroom, the walls are dirty, and the futon\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.the FUTON! I can only describe the futon as greasy and smelling like the stink of a thousand dirty feet and butts. We had to keep sheets on the futon in order to make sitting on it tolerable. We cooked our own breakfasts every morning and the pans are in dire need of replacement. In particular, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cook with the frying pan without enjoying its non-stick coating flaking into your food. The water that drips from the air conditioner creates a puddle at the front door and there are no door mats to keep from tracking dirty water into the room. When it rains, water comes in under the front door (when it is closed). B101 is on the bottom floor, so that when it rains, you also get the drippings from the deck above you. We repeatedly asked for a new room, but did not get one until three days later. In all fairness to the hotel staff though, it was a holiday weekend and the place was packed. I do believe they tried (a little) to find another room for us. We also were unaware at the time that the rooms were individually owned, and so assumed that all the rooms were in similar condition. So, when we asked for a new room, we were asking for a room with a king bed (instead of two fulls). We did not bother asking for the room to be cleaned because honestly, it would take more than a few hours to scrub this room and a cleaning will do nothing for that foul and uncomfortable (for seating) futon. On the fourth day, we moved into a new room, D201, which was a VAST improvement over the first room. The second room was clean, it smelled fresh, there were no suspect stains on comforters, and the floors were tidy. The pans were about as worn as the first room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, but usable. The futon was more comfortable to sit on, was not greasy, and did not reek. The room air conditioners were newer, quieter, and worked better. In all, I think we would have had a very different trip had we skipped the first room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to relax in a dirty, bad-smelling room. In the case of both rooms, the doors and windows aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really sealed so mosquitoes and bugs will get in. The good news though, is that the mosquitoes move slower than the ones I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to and they are easy to swat. Both rooms are huge, which is nice. Both rooms had new kitchen appliances and a full-sized refrigerator. While the Bahia Marina site advertises a DVD library from which you can borrow, be advised that not all rooms have DVD players. Our first room did not have a player. Our second room had a DVD player, but it was broken. All the comments on TripAdvisor about the staff being nice and helpful are completely TRUE. The staff is great\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.warm, friendly, and helpful. The restaurants serve amazing food. We ate at the Dakity Restaurant one night, the Shipwreck Bar and Grill one night, and enjoyed the pool-side service one afternoon. All the meals at the hotel were wonderful. Actually, all the meals during our entire visit to Culebra were wonderful. Barbara Rosa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s was our favorite (get the fish n chips or grouper, key lime pie, and/or cobbler). Other winners were El Eden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sandwiches, Susie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and one of the food stands at Flamenco Beach (the mofongo there was the best of all we tried during our 9 days in Puerto Rico).

It's tiny, quiet, no town to speak of, shopping - nil; clubs - none; trendy restaurants none. You can leave your fancy clothes at home because you'd be completely out of place if you went out in them. But if you're looking for some place to escape from it all, catch up on reading, decent snorkeling and beautiful deserted beaches, then look no further. Culebra is the great escape from civilization. Bahia Marina is good value for your money. But like everything else in Culebra, what is 5 stars on this island would struggle to get 2 stars on any other island. Where the star rating does translate is in the friendliness of the staff. I'd dare to say they are atypical of your usual Caribbean resort staff - they're friendly and helpful. Bahia Marina can use a good refresh. Although the rooms are big, they could use some fresh paint and a good scrubbing. Our room wasn't the cleanist, though it was comfortable. Bahia's restaurant had very good fare for dinner and I recommend it highly. However I differ on opinion from other reviews who suggested eating nowhere else. The food at Mamacita's and Susie's were marvelous. Especially Susie's which I believe a fair number of people would steer clear as it looks like a converted cement out-dock building that is filled with townies. Which it is, but it was by far the best eats on the island and where all the locals eat. Also a great place to hear the local gossip. If you eat only at Bahia you're missing too much of the best Culebra has to offer. Why Bahia doesn't offer some breakfast options I don't know. Seems like a lost revenue opportunity to me. Though the coffee in the pot by the bar is not to be passed up. Once I tasted it, I couldn't start my day without a visit to the bar for my morning cup. The lower pool with the swim up bar didn't have the bar open the whole time we were there and we were there for 7 nites. Not sure why. The upper pool was better place to hang out, nice views of the bay and closer to the bar. As for the beaches, although Flamenco is beautiful, it is the big popular one. Carlos Rosario is far less crowded, really good snorkeling and just a beautiful. Zoni is a treasure, about 1/2 mile long and never more than 20 people on it. Snorkeling is decent but limited to high tide. In summary Culebra is the great escape island. Absolutely nothing fancy, no extras, no shopping and no clubbing.

Culebra is only for people who love and respect nature, culture and simplicity. It has one of the top 10 beaches in the world, Flamenco beach.

The staff we interacted with at this hotel (Jose the owner, J.I. his son, Lisa who helped us with reservations among others) were some of the most hospitable hosts I have come across. From getting us from and dropping us off at the little culebra airport to being generous with their helpful advice on things to do and when and how to do them, the staff at Bahia Marina was incredible in every way. The hotel also runs a Thrifty car rental service on location (very convenient) and they hooked us up with an upgraded ride for our 3-4 days with the hotel. We got one of their 1BR condos and the unit was in great shape. The view of the bay from our living room was something amazing to wake up to each morning. The room had a full service kitchen and we bought groceries from the local supermarket and cooked up breakfast each morning. Lunches and dinners were taken around town at different locations. We ate at Bahia Marina on two nights and the fare here is REALLY good. The Chef (Dunkin) cooks up quite a plate and the whole red snapper is a delectable concoction for the not-weak-at-heart seafood fan (me). The pools are all nestled in scenic spots on the hill that BM is on and were clean. I was recommended this hotel by my travel provider and so read all the reviews for this hotel before booking.

The resort is ok, not amazing, needs a LOT of improvement. The staff needs a tune-up and an aggressive training as soon as possible if they want to stay in business. The day we got to the hotel, July 17, 2009, they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find our reservation and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything available for a party of 6. That night, finally they gave us a room for 4 people. We told Mr. Nazario if he was aware that we were 6 and not 4, his answer was; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry; we do this all the time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We had no other choice than stay there for that night. Two of us slept on the tile floor. Next day, they moved us to a 6 people room; it was nice, newer, not very clean, but it was ok, there was enough room for everyone. When we did the check-out of the room, they charged us for a six people room on the first night (more than $100.00 difference). We explained to them what happened on our first night, but they insisted we needed to pay that amount (they already had our credit card no.). Not even a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sorry for what had happened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a courtesy to the customer. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve being trying to resolve this problem thru the credit card, but it is a waist of time. Now Mr. Nazario claims that we were 9 people in the room. I want to let him know that we are not cattle. If we needed two or three rooms, we would have got them. But this is not about the money, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the attitude and the arrogance, and that is not going to stop us from claiming what is not fair. There were only 6 people, no more. He has no excuse for what he did to us. He was never friendly, looking at us over the shoulder and always whispering to the other employees in front of us, rude and careless of our situation. It seemed like it was our fault they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find our reservation. You definitively can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call that SERVICE or HOSPITALITY. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re traveling to Culebra, it is an AMAZING island with GREAT potential, BEAUTIFUL virgin beaches, nice people, GREAT restaurants, and very accessible from the main island.

We opted for a flight from Ceiba on Air Flamenco rather than the cheaper ferry. I would recommend Air Flamenco to anyone...a great staff and a great experience. After arriving at the tiny airport in Culebra, Bahia sent a van to pick us up. After a 10 minute drive, we arrived at Bahia, set on a hill overlooking the bay. The staff was perfect for such a laid back, friendly island. Professional and thorough in answering questions. The room was very clean, with a fantastic view from the balcony. It was a one bedroom/two bath apartment with a small kitchen, two beds, and a futon. I couldn't see how you could have a bad room. There are two pools, both very nice, though one is smaller and more relaxing and overlooks the bay as well. The pools are open all night, as long as you're quiet and don't disturb anyone. If you're staying more than a day, you really do need some mode of transportation. There are rental places in town, but Bahia had a Thrifty Car rental on location. We got a 2 door Jeep Wrangler for a price competitive with what the other places had them for. Bahia has an open air bar and a restaurant. The food was very good, and although the selection was limited, they did change the menu enough to make it interesting. It's fine to eat there for one meal, but the restaurants in town are so good (and close) that you'd probably want to try them out. Since the island is so small, it's easy to get comfortable with where you want to go, but the staff at Bahia is helpful nonetheless in recommendations. The most we had to drive was 20 minutes to Zoni Beach, which would be worth it at triple the distance. We liked it better than Flamenco, though you're splitting hairs over white sand beaches on an island paradise. Flamenco was 'crowded' only for Culebra...there were people on the beach, but nothing like what you would find on \"Mainland\" Puerto Rico. Zoni was an isolated strip of heaven.

First of all, the staff is really great. I have to specifically mention Juan and Luis, the manager. These guys really went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and help us enjoy our stay. First bit of advice for a visit to Culebra: Bahia Marina rents Jeeps on the premises. Do this. I know it's $95 a day, but just do it and do it for every day you're in Culebra! The best beaches on the island are accessible only by Jeep and the Bahia, while sitting perfectly atop a hill with a lovely view, is a little far away from the best and busiest parts of Culebra. You MUST make the hike to Brava and Resaca Beach. They are both well worth the effort to find (very hidden) and the effort to hike. The Resaca hike is long, treacherous, and not for the faint of heart, but all I can say is \"WOW!\" Secondly: Flamenco Beach is overrated. It's too crowded. If you want a beach with better water, a better view, and virtually no people, then rent the Jeep and go to Zoni beach. Flamenco has bathrooms, showers, food carts, etc...so it has the convenience factor going for it. We went once and that was it. Food: We ate at the Bahia for dinner once in our 4 day stay. However, the food was fantastic! We just decided to travel around and sample other places. The chef was nice enough to fix a special vegetarian dish for my wife since the menu, like all menus in Puerto Rico, is built for carnivores. (Go meat!) Naturally, you should visit the much talked-about Mamacita's--for lunch or dinner. For a pricey but delicious meal, go down the hill to the Club Seaborne. Don't miss a taking a meal at the Bahia though. The Pandeli, while having GREAT coffee and bread, a decent breakfast, and pretty good sandwiches is stuffed to the gills with the rudest staff on the island. I don't know if they're just rude or they hate working there, but they aren't very friendly with the locals, let alone the gringos. The Spot is a great little place for lunch. Very friendly staff and good food with an ecclectic menu. Do this place for lunch instead of the Pandeli. Rooms at the Bahia: They are like what you've heard from others. Very roomy, pretty clean, and badly in need of a new paint job. Don't expect Hilton-like accommodations and you'll be fine. The deck is great. The fridge is big and cold. The two bathrooms are really big and are conducive to privacy. The bed was OK, if a little hard. The view was gorgeous. The pools at the Bahia are also very nice. Finally, FLY to Culebra. Don't take the ferry. And, no matter what anyone at the Bahia suggests, DO NOT fly Vieques Air Link. Book your flight with Air Flamenco. When you get to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, you'll see what I'm taking about. Air Flamenco has the look and feel of a real airline. Vieques Air Link was always late and very unprofessional. Culebra island has some very poor parts and isn't for the hoitey-toitey Bahamas crowd. No, it's a real place where real people live and work. But, its coasts and woodlands are just gorgeous and are a nature lover's paradise.", "Date": "July 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cA Piece of Paradise, but only for nature lovers\u201d", "Author": "IsabelitaPuertoRico", "ReviewID": "UR32466402", "Content": "If you love nature, beautiful views, peace and tranquility....Bahia Marina is for you.

The Villas are VERY rustic, you do not get room service every day and they give you very thin towels and soap. There is NO restaurant or cafe, NADA you are on your own, you need to buy food, all the Villas have small kitchens.

I preferred Bahia Marina because the rooms are spacious, clean, housekeeping every day, wonderful food at night and magnificent views, also a very nice pool and great people to help you out. You need to rent a jeep, they run $50.00/day, but you can run around the island and visit ALL the beaches. There are economical taxis but the attitude in Culebra is \"don` t worry be happy\" so if you tell them to pick you up at 2:00, most probably will get there at 3:00, but......this is Culebra, people are happy and they have 0 stress.

As far as the Bahia Marina is concerned, it is probably the best hotel on the island. The staff is very friendly. The rooms are really nice for the price you pay.

After much pre-trip research and reading many of the favorable reviews about it, we decided to stay here. It was certainly a good choice! Most notable about this place is the friendliness, warmth, and enthusiasm of the staff. They were not so much eager to please but were just genuinely and earnestly providing excellent service sometimes above and beyond what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re required and expected to do. They seem to treat their guests much like neighbors or friends; yet very respectful and professional. The place itself is beautifully situated in a quiet part of the island with panoramic views and lush surroundings. A car is a must to stay here as it is not walking distance to town but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need a car to see much of Culebra anyway. The grounds, facilities, and rooms are well-maintained and very clean. Both pools are beautiful although we preferred the views off the upper pool. We were in suite C201 with an expansive view of the bay (Ensenada Honda). Our suite has two double beds in the bedroom and a fold-out futon in the living room. We opted to sleep in the living room to enjoy the sea breeze coming over the balcony at night. Unfortunately, the awning above the balcony makes a loud flapping sound whenever there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breeze, much like a flag fluttering loudly in the wind. It kept me up at night. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my only true complaint about our room. The kitchen is well-equipped (although no oven but not a big deal unless you plan to cook your Thanksgiving turkey there!); we cooked breakfast there every morning and enjoyed it on our balcony to watch the sun rise. In general, the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants do not serve breakfast or lunch on most days. We had dinner in the resort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant (Shipwreck Bar & Grill). I had a very tasty, artfully presented whole fried snapper (see pics) and my wife had their sumptuous and unique \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Culebra Burger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd-- basically ground beef mixed with chorizo\u00e2\u20ac\u201ddelicious! The restaurant has a relaxed ambiance to it, right down to the locals and guests who hang around its bar. The open air structure is unbeatable for having the breeze just flow through while you dine. The service was very responsive and our waitress polite and gracious. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not staying at Bahia Marina, the restaurant alone is worth a visit! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lively place to just hang out and meet locals or other guests. Overall, I believe Bahia Marina is the best place to stay in Culebra if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a comfortable, well-appointed accommodation. As some reviewers had mentioned, do not expect 5-star, Ritz-like level accommodations here.

If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not looking to camp, or your comfort requirements are more than what a guest house or B&B can provide, then Bahia Marina is probably the best you will find in Culebra.

SInce the only meal served at the hotel is dinner, you need to plan on going to the store in 10 mins away in Dewey for provisioning. As an American territory, most of the items at the store are very similar to what you would find in a small supermarket in the states, at generally the same prices, so no problem. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and by day two everyone seemed to know us by name, and were interested in our trip, and strived to be very helpful. The location in on a hill overlooking the bay, but the beach at Punta Soldado is about a 5 min. drive and then a 10 min. hike to some of the best snorkeling. The island vibe is somewhat similar to that of the British Virgin Islands, which we visited many times before coming to Culebra, except a bit more \"American\", which means more North Americans and better food, Culebra has less night life than places in the BVI like Foxy's and the Willie T, but Manacitas and the Dinghy Dock were fun nonetheless. And the main beaches, like Playa Flamenco and Zoni, are beautiful and secluded, as advertised. Although everyone has heard of St. Thomas, Its amazing that more people in the states have not heard of Culebra Island, which is within sight of the both the USVIs and mainland Puerto Rico.

Also I was called 2 days prior to reconfirm certain issues ( like a car ). The island is amazing, We had been to Vieques a lot in the late 90's and although on the surface it reminded me of it I feel deeper there is an essential difference. Culebra is small, you will see the same faces around if you stay a week. There seemed to be ( here again I emphasize seemed ) more mixture of all society than I saw on Vieques. The beaches in my opinion and the landscape are more beautiful than Vieques. ( again just my opinion ) The hotel was wonderful.

One con would be housekeeping. They did a good job but if you wanted a full change of beds and/or new towels I would advise calling the front desk-but never a problem!!

This is a really laid back island that is beautiful. If you want pampering and 5 star food, go to St. Barts. If you want friendly people, beautiful beaches and a calm and relaxing island, then Culebra is for you. This is a good hotel. We stayed in A101. It was a handicap room that I think was missing a washer and dryer. Room had some age on it. The view was obscured by 2 palms that were planted right in front of the balcony. They really served no purpose, and probably should be moved, or trimmed back. The reason we choose this hotel was because of the kitchens. It would allow us to cook breakfast and make lunches for the beach. The kitchens do not have ovens, only microwaves. The dishes and glasses were old and mismatched. There is no exhaust on the stove, so smells stay in the room. We cooked dinner 2 nights and really had to improvise to make it work. These are barely kitchens, and if you want to save money by cooking, be prepared to work hard. Housekeeping was very bad. They did not change the sheets or vacuum or mop. Trash was not empty and soaps and shampoos were not restocked. We were not sure any one had come to the room at all for the first 2 days. I mentioned this to the staff, and the room was cleaned very well that day, but no soap or shampoo. There is no excuse for poor housekeeping. I had dinner in the bar restaurant one night, and although the staff was very confused and disorganized, the food was good. I also heard from others that the food is good there. Just a little chaotic. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel. I wasn't expecting 1st class accommodations, and I didn't get it. But I did have a comfortable room that allowed me to enjoy all of what Culebra has to offer. If you keep your expectations low, you won't be disappointed. If you need a ride from San Juan to Fajardo, call Pavin Travel. $65 for two people and they will pick you up at your hotel or airport and drive you to the ferry. The drive is no more than 1.5 hours, and can be made in 1 hour with light traffic. These are friendly people, and when I changed my plans, they were quick to accommodate me.

Just want to preface this by saying we generally stay at larger chains like the Intercontinental, Westin or W, or at luxury boutique hotels and we live in a relatively new luxury apartment in our hometown. So we thought the 2 BR would be a better fit for us as it's brand new. They erroneously put us in the 1 BR. As we were only staying in Culebra overnight, I didn't want to make a big fuss about it and just stayed put. But I did have to make some payment corrections as they charged us more. The staff was very nice about it. The 1 BR can probably sleep anywhere between 4-6 people. There are two full-sized beds in the bedroom and a futon in the living room. View of the water from the living room is beautiful. However, I do have to say that the conditions of the 1 BR is kind of run-down for our tastes. The beds were extremely old and creaky, the sheets were rough with pilling. There was concrete mixture on the baseboards which made things look dirty. Bathroom fixtures were old. We didn't use the kitchen or pools so I have no comment on that. I hate to admit it, but we're kind of spoiled. I think the 2 BR would have been much better for us. So if you're used to more luxurious accommodations, I think the 2 BR is the way to go, even if you're only a party of two. I was also a bit surprised as I expected a bit more based on the price. I wasn't expecting Marriott type of quality and amenities, but just expected a more well-maintained room. Everybody there was extremely nice and friendly. I feel kind of bad writing this review considering how wonderful the staff was, but I want to write an honest and objective viewpoint of the place.

(all NYers should have to put an asterisk on their review as we are all a bit on the picky side). That said, we found Bahia to be a great place to stay on the small island of Culebra. The room was quaint and spacious. The bathroom was a bit poorly designed with too much wasted open space for no reason. However, it was very nice that the room had two bathrooms. One complaint was that we were placed on the ground floor right next to the bar/restaurant, so the first night we did hear quite a bit of noise when we took a nap. The room did have a nice view of the marina. One big mistake on our part was to leave the terrace door open while we slept - we were eaten alive by mosquitoes, so USE CAUTION AND DON'T LEAVE WINDOWS AND DOORS OPEN AT NIGHT. The restaurant, if I had to rate it, would be a 3 on a scale of five. They accommodate nicely, but overall we felt the food was not that great, especially when compared to simple Latinas Comidas traditional food that for this reviewer is the highlight of any trip to PR. The restaurant is mid-price. The staff at the hotel is incredible, especially Anita and Michelle who go out of their way to make you feel at home. Outside of the hotel, a beautiful small island vibe awaits anyone traveling to Culebra, and within the confines of Bahia, great service and attention to detail are the highlights.

It is an Villa/ condo facility bordering a 100-acre nature preserve. The resort is on a ridge with AMAZING panoramic views (from the Villa wrap-around balconies) of Fulladoza Bay and the seas bordering Culebra. You really have to see it to believe it - pics just don't do it justice. Every unit has cable TV (including HBO) and internet access, plus the public areas have free wireless (wifi) internet. There are two main swimming pools, a wading pool and a Jacuzzi. Parking is free and \"Tony\" will pick you up and drop you off at the airport or fairy dock at no charge. You can also rent a car (Thrifty Rental) right at the property when you check in. We stayed in the one bedroom Villa (referred to as \"Phase I\", although \"Lisa\" - one of the owners - does not like that term - she prefers \"Villas\" as opposed to the \"Condos\" of \"Phase II\":-)), which has two full size beds, two full bathrooms with showers, a living room area (with a queen size micro fiber futon), a kitchenette area (which includes dishes, silverware, pots and pans, coffee maker and toaster), and two A/C units (one in the living room and one in the bedroom). The inside of the Villa is pleasant, although in some need of paint, and some general maintenance. For example, one of our toilets would run until we manually adjusted the inside apparatus after each use, and the A/C in the bedroom sounded like a jet plane was taking off, such that we had to turn it off every night in order to sleep. Plus, the water pressure was non-existent in both showers, and the bathroom entrances are strikingly narrow (if you are a professional football player, you will have to enter the bathroom sideways :-)) \"Housekeeping\" was also a bit spartan (made beds and changed garbage bags only). The facility has 2 restaurants (and both are only open for dinner, I think - not sure about lunch cuz we were always in town or snorkeling during the day -- but definately not breakfast): Shipwrecks Bar and Grill (a more casual dining experience downstairs) and Dakity's (a little bit more upscale restaurant upstairs - only open on the weekends). Chef \"Anne\" at Dakity's is amazing - our first night there we enjoyed outstanding pumpkin and ginger cream soup, asparagus risotto and chocolate souffle. Unbelievable!! And both restaurants went out of their way to let us order \"off the menu\" in order to feed my vegetarian traveling companion. The best part was that there are essentially only 4-5 other restaurants on the Isle (Club Seaborne's, Mamasitas, Dinghy Dock's, Heather's, and Suzies on Wed - Sun), and since Shipwrecks/Dakity's are BY FAR the best, \"our\" bar and restaurant would really bustle at night (in an otherwise quiet atmosphere), making us feel like the kids with the cool parents with the best house in the neighborhood ;-) Keep in mind that , while the service is attentive and friendly, it is still \"Island-paced\" - so be prepared to wait a little while for your food (especially when they are busy) - but just kick back and enjoy the Island breeze. And...ah the hosts - family run businesses are the best! Jose \"Sr\" (owner/operator) was the best kind of \"can-do\" person on the planet. He was ALWAYS around, If we needed anything (even during the \"off-hours\"), we only had to ask once. And, even though the bar did not open \"technically\" until 3 PM, Jose, Jr. (\"JI\" as he is called, so as not to confuse him with Jose \"Sr\") was always willing to make us his special \"Jose\" Daiquiri (a splendid mix of strawberry, lime, and pineapple juices plus lemon zest -- yum!). Their Bushwaker (yes, \"waker\", not \"wacker\") blended chocolatey drink is also delicious. And speaking of the \"Bushwaker\", JI's Uncle, \"Captain Bill\", will take you out for the best chartered catamaran (named the \"Bushwaker\") trip of your life. You can go on a fishing trip, a scenic trip, or a snorkeling trip - whatever you like - he's at your service. And if you decide to go fishing (and catch a yellow-fin tuna or the like), Jose Sr. will fry it up, or sushi it up, for you! And speaking of the \"people\" part, we cannot forget the very helpful and responsive Aileen (who helps with preliminary reservations etc.), the kind and gentle spirited Tony (our \"chauffeur \"), the feisty and funny Michelle (Asst. General Manager, who does everything from checking you in/out, to renting you your car, to shuttling you to/from the airport, to housekeeping... as needed) , to delightful and chatty Lisa (married to Jose Sr.), to sweet and warm Leah at the bar. I won't name them all, but ALL of the staff was kind and friendly - a complete delight. So...go for the people AND THE VIEW from your balcony (see attached pics - the 1st 2 are views from inside the Villa - the 3rd is a pic of the Villas themselves from the road below - they are the 3 pink structures way at the top of the pic). You will never tire of either one! We will be back every single year. There is simply nothing else like it. Oh, by the way, the \"Phase II\" (sorry Lisa) Condos are now on the market.

The food was really good! It's very enjoyable to have dinner in the open air. * Loved Lorraine, the bartender. * Loved that they had live music one day during the week. * Everything is pretty close to the hotel - including the gorgeous beaches, restaurants and shops. Cons: * Service sucks pretty bad - communication is seriously lacking. They don't answer emails and they don't like answering the phones. They keep you waiting for an hour at the location they are to pick up at. Check-in took way too long. But we were determined to have a good time regardless. * Sheets were requested to be changed and weren't. I had to change my own sheets and make my own bed because the cleaning crew left for the day. * The faucets were nauseatingly filthy and weren't cleaned after we requested it. * Missing handle in shower - they never got to fixing it. * The vents in the A/C in the kitchen was held in place by newspaper and cardboard. * The floors were filthy, even after they cleaned it. * Dirty pool until the last day we were there. * On the last day there, a roach came out to greet us and bid us farewell. Would we stay there again? Maybe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if they were cleaner. I definitely I paid way too much for seriously lacking service. I never felt comfortable walking barefoot in the room. But the beaches in Culebra are amazingly gorgeous! Flamenco is overcrowded, but if you find a secluded spot all the way at the end, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfect! Zoni Beach is not too far, and we highly recommend it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s secluded and gorgeous as well. Avoid El Eden if you can \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the guy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife is a thief! He told us one already hefty price for beer, and she decided to make it more expensive when we checked out! >:{}", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puerto Rico", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "julitza", "ReviewID": "UR18692293", "Content": "First of all the best experience was the Dakity Restaurant.

From the minute we checked in the front desk took care of us. We arrived earlier than expected and sat at the breezy bar for a few Medallas (the local beer) and after about 30 minutes we were able to check in early. We were given what I felt was the best room in the resort, because the view and the top porch. The room itself was clean and large (my husband and I were traveling with another couple and could have easily had another couple stay, because it was that big). The two bathroom unit was very convienent and private for us. As for the island of Culebra itself, it is beautiful, but beware unfortunately, the Culebrans were not as friendly as other Puerto Ricans that I've met before. Outside of the resort we didn't feel much love. Watch out for parking signs! My husband received a $75 parking ticket for parking in a tour van only load zone by the ferry. The sign was not noticable and we were only parked for 2 minutes when the cop came over and started writing us a ticket. My husband went over and asked what was going on, and when he saw the sign asked if he could move the jeep. The cop replied \"after I finish writing you a ticket.\" We also noticed that he did not write tickets for the car parked in front and behind us - turns out they target tourists, because they know they will pay the ticket.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Wedding Reception!\u201d", "Author": "MaryElise", "ReviewID": "UR18323922", "Content": "We celebrated our wedding in Culebra in June 2008.

Housekeeping never even bothered, all they did was make the beds. One night I spent 2 hours at the Dakiti restaurant, I practically had to beg to get 2 drinks throughout the 2 hours. The dinner I had reserved in advanced had already been sold but I did get a console dinner, after getting a discount for my frustration, this 2 dinner meal came out close to $100, Where in the rest of the island, good food and great svc doesn't cost more than $55. Two of my requests to a female worker at the desk were completely ignored. The one that left a very good impression on my husband and myself was the new manager Luis, he absolutely went out of his way to fulfill every request including the ones that were ignored by the other worker, he never made a face (like the other lady) and was more than happy to accommodate us as much as he could, even though he had just started working there a few days prior to our arrival. If anyone wants to see pictures of the room full of cobwebs and dead roach, feel free to e-mail me. In Culebra it is very easy to get transportation from the airport to the rest of the island, it is also very convinient to rent a car as soon as you arrive. I rented from Bahia Marina (Thrifty's). The inside of the car was dirty and hard to see when driving since the inside of the windshield had a nice film of dirt throughout. The last thing I wanted to do was clean my car rental and encounter dead roaches and cob webs in my room during my vacation.
