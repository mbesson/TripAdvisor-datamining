The room was cutely decorated though and was clean. The bed was uncomfortable and the towels were the cheapest, thinnest ones I have ever used. But my biggest complaint was the noise. You could here everything from the rooms around you. I literally was woken up by someone farting in the room next door. The neighbor's shower sounded like it was in the middle of our room. And you can here everyone entering and leaving their room. And there was some falling down shed that was the view from our room. I am not sure what type of clientelle this motel is trying to attract. It was recently remodeled to look Tuscan, but the cheap towels and amenities in the room kind of detracted from the room. We only stayed here one night, which was OK.

First, the man on the phone could not find our reservation--it took a solid fifteen minutes of checking, even though I had booked it directly and had an email response from their website. Then he went silent at my 8:00 arrival time and finally said, \"well, you'll have to ring for someone at the office.\" A tad unfriendly, but we really just wanted a place to sleep that night. And that's what we would have had, if we had been able to make it to our room. Because the man on the phone had utterly neglected to inform us that this was \"Cruise Night\" in Napa, where all the teenagers in the area get together and party on the last Saturday before school starts. We didn't know anything about it at the time; all we knew was that when we reached Jefferson there were people everywhere: lining the streets, driving cars up and down the road, riding bicycles all over, playing music, shouting, shoving, making out. It was like entering a concert ground. We crawled through this traffic onto Jefferson; we idled while some kids shouted back and forth with a tricked-out SUV; when we finally came up to the \"Chardonnay Lodge\" we were greeted with the facade of a motel, a locked and darkened office, and a parking lot stuffed with cars and teenagers. We were at a loss as to how we would even get in there, much less how we were supposed to sleep with all this chaos around us. I know now that the cops quiet everything down after 10, but after a long day of driving and celebrating we just felt shellshocked at the scene. Shellshocked, and furious that no one had bothered to point out to us that we would be arriving in the midst of this. It's an annual event in Napa; it would have been courteous to give us some advance notice. Other reviewers are correct in pointing out that this establishment is a distance from downtown Napa; I'm not sure if the area was run down per se but it was definitely a residential neighborhood, with a large school across the street and nothing to walk to but a few strip malls. Perhaps the rooms were in decent shape, but the outward appearance was that of a cheap motel, not a $140 per night \"lodge\", nor the spa-like atmosphere that the website presents. We simply didn't go. We couldn't get in the parking lot and we could see nowhere nearby that we could park and walk to our room. And quite frankly, we didn't want to be fighting our way through crowds of raucous teens; we wanted to relax, have a hot shower, and stroll through quiet streets for a late dinner.

The freezer was not cleaned as there was a frozen entree from someone else. There was no light cover in the main room---just two lightblubs glaring at you. The coffee maker was not cleaned out as putting water in the reservior, up pops this old coffee filter! YES! they had a ice machine . . . but you had to pay for the ice! The carpet is old and stained. Check in time is 2 PM while check out time is at 11 AM. We felt cheated out on four hours of storing our belongings there while we did more touring. We requested a late check out, but the management refused us that option. One more thing, our relatives in another room actually ran out of toilet paper. They had to go to the office to request more. They gave it to them through a little window that they had to squeeze it through. Their room had very little space to walk around the bed to get to the the closet. They did not have a microwave in their room as advertised. We have never complained about places with some issues, but this one takes the cake!
