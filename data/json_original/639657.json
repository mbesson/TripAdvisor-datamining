I may have missed out on a wonderful week!!! Hotel Yunque Mar IS situated in a residential area, people in the area were friendly and I never felt uncomfortable walking around, I stayed there with my 12 yr old daughter and if I had felt it was unsafe I would have checked out and went somewhere else. The rooms are clean and simple. What I really loved was the sounds of the ocean and the waves crashing in. So serene and relaxing. Honestly I was surprised to see the ocean ran right up to the hotel but staff explained it is becasue of the high tides at this time of the year and that during the summer it goes down again, this is not the hotels fault of course mother nature does as she pleases and besides within walking distance you have the Blaneario beach which was excellent! But the high tides from the back of the hotel didnt turn some people away from getting into the ocean though, a man who was staying with his 10 yr old son was swimming and having a blast! I was just happy to sit next to the pool reading my book while my daughter interacted with other kids in the pool. The staff was great,very helpful and made you feel like family, I had actually thought that the staff were all family but was told \" we feel and act like it but we are not related\" which is always a great feeling to have when staying in a cozy place like Yunque Mar. Breakfast was good, always great to have something to wake up to...coffee is what I need most in the mornings so I was greatful to walk down from my room to the smell of Puerto Rican coffee. The hotel is also close to the Bio Bay in Las Croabas (Fajardo), ziplining and very close to golf courses and major Hotels where you can go to the casinos and of course they are just a few minutes from El Yunque Rinforest, one thing I haven't read about though are two wonderful art shops that are less than five minutes from this Hotel, if you are an art lover than I suggest you visit these shops, 90% of what they have is by local artists. The restaurant was wonderful we had a great time there the food was wonderful especially for the prices. One last thing I would like to mention is the hotel seems to be expanding in other areas such as a gazebo was being built and also they will be having some sort of convenience store and what seems to be a food stand of sorts so appearently it just keeps on getting better, I plan to go back to Puerto Rico next year and can't wait to see what changes have been made!

We wanted to love this place; the owners expansive art collection is hung in all of the common areas of the hotel so there's a gallery feel to the place.

The sea is crashing on the foundation of the building and atop the massive sea walls built at the base of all of the buildings in this beach area. Getting to the beach requires walking thru this grim and gritty neighborhood, out onto the highway, then back thru an abandoned ball field. The room - was sold as 'garden view'. From our first floor, we could touch the cinder block wall that was painted with pictures of plants; the actual plants were 3 or 4 palm trees planted in a 18\" trough. The sliding glass door that gave access to our 'patio' had no screen so for an entire week, we had no fresh air in the room - the mosquitoes and no-see-ms virulent so not worth the risk. The beds - were new and really comfy. But the sheets were old and ill fitting so every morning we work up in a tangle of bottom sheet and on the bare mattress - no bed pads were provided. During our weeks stay, the sheets were never changed, even though we asked for this service more than once. The towels - were thread bare and tiny. We never had a face cloth or hand towel. Beach towels were frequently unavailable; clean towels were unavailable more than once. A family we met were offered a bath mat in lieu of a clean towel for their 3 year old - ridiculous. The maid service - was iffy at best. A little pile of sand left by our hiking sandals remained for the entire week; hair and a dead mosquito swam in the edge of the sink for days. The room was cleaned in a very very cursory way - and once not at all. The breakfast - was exactly the same every morning - an egg, a slice of deli ham, processed cheese slice, bread; mediocre coffee (the milk was warm though) and tang or sunny-d type orange drink. Just a few tweeks to this place could really add up - offer a piece of locally grown fruit at breakfast; expand the breakfast menu to include yogurt and cereal; squeeze real juice (at the side of the road, people are selling fresh fruit and enormous bags of oranges) locally source the coffee. Get some new linens, especially bottom sheets. Change the sheets atleast once during a week stay. Get some new towels or atleast make sure that the towels you have now are available clean each day. Put a refigerator in each room; there is not a store close enough to walk to and there is not a restaurant at this hotel; being able to have snacks and a cold beer (or cold milk for children) would add great value.

At night it was relaxing to listen to the ocean enjoy the evening breeze and the companionship of other guests. The breakfast was made and served by a pleasant couple.We only ate breakfast at the hotel but other guests had light meals and snacks prepared for them which they enjoyed and reported were very tasty. As other reviewers have reported the hotel is in a residential area , there are no sidewalks and the streets are narrow and dark making it hard to walk around at night , but fine to do so during the day. We were about a 10 minute walk along the beach away from Luquillo Beach, where all of the kisoks are located. By car this is a a quick drive, note that all of the kiosks are not open weekdays . We enjoyed the food at many including Conga and one whose name I don't remember that had local beers on draft such as Santo Viego a refreshing stout. El Yunque Rainforest was a short car ride away so close that we went to El Yunque two days in a row -the second day just to swim and enjoy Mina Falls.

I am Puertorican and partial to small, less expensive hotels wherever I go. Just spent two nights at the Yunque Mar, looking for a break from difficult past two weeks. If you are afraid of strangers/locals, maybe this is not a hotel for you.This small hotel sits in the typical beach community of Playa Fortuna in Luquillo, PR. Look in Google Earth west of the Balneario. The real estate in this area is high although it is not quite developed yet. Many expensive vacation homes among native family dwellings. It is as safe as anywhere else. The Yunque Mar is family owned. Overheard it was built in 2000 to serve as a hotel, so it's architecturally pleasant. What impressed me was it's cleanliness, tasteful decoration, bright rooms and friendliness. Loved the covered terraces almost over the ocean, with its bar room where breakfast is served and an adjacent area where tables and comfortable chairs are available to relax any time of day. Owner and staff were prompt to answer any questions and offer help. This is a very basic hotel, no hair blower nor ironing board... although I imagine that asking will get you a long way. Readers bring your book light to read in bed. I didn't take my laptop but was told they have wifi at the premises. I found that my room's glass door due to the salitre (salt from ocean wind), did not lock securely but we didn't do anything about it. If it is important to you, then check this out. Free advise: dress and act low key, no jewelry, no one foot long lenses, no Gucci bags\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this is a very informal beach community. Ask advise from the owners. I am not a swimmer, so the beach in front of the hotel, even though it is beautiful to look at and listen to, is not for me. However the Balneario de Luquillo (Balneario La Monserrate is the correct name but that name is not used much.. Link: http://www.parquesnacionalespr.com/monserrate_bal.asp is closed Mon and Tue for cars and other facilities like toilets, showers, beach chairs, but can be accessed anytime on foot for free) is less than a 30 minute walk away. We walked along the beach to the Balneario the first day but decided not to do it again because there is a place which I found dangerous to cross. There was a cement small bridge or something in the past, but it broke and I didn't want to cross through it again. Ok for the young and fearless I guess. Otherwise take other nearby inland paths or if money is no problem, drive and park at the Balneario for US$4.28 entrance fee. Loved eating at the kioskos. Learn the names for our finger foods: bacalaitos, empanadas, empanadillas, rellenos de papa, and my favorites piononos and alcapurrias... Not finger foods like mofongo, arroz with whatever, morcillas \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Kioskos have good food, like kiosko #57, but music is quite noisy. There will be some kiosks open from 8am to 11pm or later in high season. Also had dinner at kiosko #1 (I think), named La Parrilla, excellent ambiance and good food but not too cheap.

A good overall Puerto Rican experience!\u201d", "Author": "3pointsteve", "ReviewID": "UR24562939", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel together with my girlfriend in two different occasions in jan 2009. Here there are my impressions; I try to be as objective as possible, but at any case, my point of view is going to be the one of an open minded european tourist in his late 20s. LOCATION: The best thing about it is probably its location, about 45 minutes away from San Juan airport and just 10 minutes away from both the El Yunque national tropical forest and the beaches at Luquillo. It is also in a quite convenient location for getting to Fajardo (ferry to Culebra, Vieques) or to the city of San Juan itself. ROOMS: The rooms where we stayed were both slightly outdated, but clean and cozy; the first one was actually not too big, whereas the second one was very roomy and comfortable. There is A/C and a small balcony in all of the hotel rooms; there's no room safe, but you can give all your valuable items to the staff which will hold them for you . Hotel is family owned and staff was nice with us all of the time, offering ice when needed, (good) advices on nearby restaurants and everything else we needed. POOL/BEACH: As some other reviewer pointed out, the pool is not to big, but nevertheless it's a nice calm place just to hang around & sun bathe or just relax. The beach in front of the hotel was also very shallow in this period of the year, but a 10 minutes walk allowed us to reach the Balneario (see pic), a very nice beach, especially suited for families, swimming (calm sea, sandy bottom) or simply relaxing. A 10 minutes drive also allowed us to reach the Luquillo town center and the \"La Pared\" (= \"The Wall\") beach, where some good wave activity and sandy bottom creates great conditions for boogie boarding and also surfing (looked to me like a great place where to start learning). PLACES WHERE TO EAT: Nearby area looks very peaceful and safe; even if the hotel lacks a restaurant, there are many options (restaurants/fast foods) available within the 5/10 minutes car ride range, so that it's hard to starve to death :-) Nearby Kioskos (see pic) can also be reached on foot in about 10 minutes. Following hotel staff suggestions, we ate at one of these, called the \"La Parilla\" (=\"The Grill\") one night and lobster, as everything else we had, was delicious. Value was ok and staff was also very friendly. Then, following the owner suggestions, we also had dinner at a place called Sea King (just opposite the gas station near the cemetery, in Luquillo), but unfortunately the overall experience here hasn't been as memorable. Food was actually very good and very affordable also (great value here!). Too bad, what could've been a great dining experience for us was ruined by some completely untrained and rude waiter there. If you're lucky to have some nicer person serving you, I'm sure this can turn out into a wonderful experience. At any case, I guess the whole Luquillo area is very good for eating some great sea food. It basically won't be hard to find a place to eat. ;-) Sodas, Beers and other drinks can be purchased directly at the hotel, which also offers complimentary ice and serves a decent breakfast in the morning. VALUE: Back to the hotel, value was ok for us, but it could've actually been a little better. This is not to say I was not satisfied overall, but now I know there are some discounts on certain periods at the hotel and then the price per night definitely becomes much more interesting. Still, I think we've got what we've payed for, especially when I compare the hotel with other facilities we stayed in the Caribbeans (probably not the cheapest area in the world :-) OVERALL My girlfriend and me love to try to blend with the culture and lifestyle of the places we visit and, although we expect cleanliness, we don't have high luxury standards; my review has been written accordingly and I can say this has been a good experience for us. We might also decide to come back. sometimes in the future. Of course, if luxury is mandatory for you and you're used to big 5 star resorts, you might be probably better off looking at some other place. It's the Caribbean though, so if you're looking for cheap luxury, I'm afraid you might have better luck just heading to Vegas instead ;-)", "Date": "February 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hartford, CT", "Title": "\u201cBasic room, great service, good location\u201d", "Author": "robingrn", "ReviewID": "UR23738316", "Content": "Spent 3 nights at the Yunque Mar Hotel.

There are lots of littlekiosks selling lunch and pina coladas and the water is super calm , swimmable and beautifully turquoise. If you walk out of the hotel and go left 15 minutes, you pass a river jetting into the ocean that looks like the Amazon to me, and if you cross it you end up at the Westin, where you can use their beach! All the beaches in the PR are public. Although this hotel is essentially just a room you are paying for, it is an excellent value and if you come for the beaches you will not be disappointed.

There is a small public terrace on the second floor at the front, and at the rear is a larger terrace area and bar facing the ocean. Although we did not use the small swimming pool, it looked clean and inviting. Simple but tasty meals are served at the hotel either on the rear terrace, or in a basement dining area. (It looked a bit like a church basement, but it served the purpose.) We ate dinner at the hotel 2 of our 3 nights, and we can recommend the filet of fish. Other than the food stands along the highway, there seems to be a lack of restaurants in Luquillo, so eating at the hotel was a convenient choice. The beach by the hotel is narrow and the surf is rough. It is not a place to swim, but rather a beach for walking and getting your feet wet.

This hotel cost me around 80+$ and was the only oceanfront property I stayed in. We had a poolview room with a balcony (the pool being right below our balcony). I have no complaints about the room, location or the estabilishment. The street where the hotel is located is a semi residential area and very laid back. The pool opens up to the ocean but somehow most places lock the gates in the night. We could here the ocean from the hallway as we entered our room. The place had air conditioning. We reached around 2 AM on Christmas day and they called us and gave us instructions on reaching the property and the room. Room cleaning was on time even on Christmas day. I will stay here again but if I find a cheaper place I would go for it because this is slightly over my budget. They were also prompt in responding to reservation emails and phone calls.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Yunque Mar", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g635965-d639657-Reviews-Hotel_Yunque_Mar-Luquillo_Puerto_Rico.html", "Price": "$114 - $120*", "Address": "<div class=\"wrap_bl wrap\">", "HotelID": "639657", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/37/8b/06/hotel-yunque-mar.jpg"}}
