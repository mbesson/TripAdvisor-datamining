Staff: The staff was very friendly and accommodated anything we needed. While the staff was friendly, the cleaning staff was very inconsistent. Our room wasn't cleaned one day, we didnt get towels a few days, and things like facial tissue would not be replaced. Location: The hotel is centrally-located. Everything is within a 15-20 minute walk but nothing is within a five minute walk....so, if you want to be in the middle of the action, this is not your place. Pool: The pool is small and only 4' deep, but it was well kept. However, a major complaint is that the designated smoking section for the entire hotel is at the pool...this makes no sense--the only place you're allowed to smoke is around other hotel guests trying to relax with their families. Can't the smoking section be put in the garage or, better yet, not on the property at all? Smelling cigarettes while trying to play with my baby daughter was disgusting. Room: The room felt clean and, as a suite, was a great size to splurge for the week. The downside is the suites face the front of the building...so, we were constantly woke up by drunks getting out of cabs, motorcycles roaring down the road and a rooster that began cockle-doodle-dooing every morning around 4:30am and would continue for hours (no, that is not a joke).", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "Suzanne L", "ReviewID": "UR126158609", "Content": "We were very pleased witheverything about our stay at the Silver Palms.

First and foremost, the staff is excellent! They are very attentive and beyond helpful. They made reservations for us, gave pinpoint directions and provided us with anything we needed at the drop of a hat. They are very polite and courteous and made you feel that no request was beyond their reach. The room was comfy and clean. We slept Great! The bed and pillows are just as comfortable as the ones we use at home. The water pressure in the shower is awesome. We loved the \"Green\" aspect concerning the lights and air conditioning. Though, it did take some getting used to putting your key card in to operate them. Brilliant idea! Let's save the planet! :) The pool and surrounding areas were very clean and there was adequate seating for all to catch some rays. The one slight negative was that the pool is on the small side and not very deep. (5ft.). Perfect for cooling off. The breakfast was continental style. Fruit, bagels, croissants, muffins, danishes, and the like. Perfect way to start your day on your way out the door to explore the island. If you are expecting more than that you will be disappointed. Finally, the Hotel is located a couple blocks from the noise of Duval street. All of the attractions are less than a 20 min walk away. If walking isn't your bag, the guys at the front desk will be happy to rent you a bicycle. We found the location of the Hotel perfect. One final thing....The wild Roosters that inhabit the Island may wake you on occasion. It's part of the island's charm. This did not bother me. However, my girlfriend did use the earplugs the hotel provides. They've thought of everything! Enjoy your stay!

The only thing about the room was a slight smell of sulfer that was prevalent in the bathroom from the large drain in the floor. I'm assuming the drain had to do with the beach / sand / drainage (?). The smell was not terrible though and easily ignored. In terms of service, we had forgotten to print an electronic ticket for our trip to the Dry Tortugas and the front desk was kind enough to print it for us.

We only requested maid service for one day in a week stay and housekeeping was worried that we weren't being taken care of. (Now where else would you get that service??)

I did not know until the morning of my flight, that the airline I was flying with went ahead and cancelled all flights departing that day. I was devastated and beyond disappointed.

I was flying into Fort Lauderdale and staying there over night then driving to Key West in the morning. I called the Silver Palms Inn to inform them about my situation. The manager stated that she was aware of the severe weather and snowstorm because it was all over the news but it was \"too bad\" for me because they required 48 hours for a cancellation and I was only giving them 24. I tried to reason with her and explain that this was an act of nature and that there was no way humanly possible for me to make it over there. I would have rather beeen in a warm sunny place than snowed in but she would not budge. I was not even offered a credit for a future stay. I would have gladly taken that but she (Hansa) proceeded to charge me $312 for the first night regardless of the situation. I was disgusted and disappointed in how I was treated.

We then had to base our next morning around hoping the 'manager' could finally grace us with their presence. Once he did, he continued to blame us for staining sheets that he claimed were washed and the stains would not come out. I then asked him for OUR sheets since we were charged for them and they were now our property. He said he did not have the sheet but would check with house keeping. HE DIDNT HAVE THE SHEET BECAUSE THEY REMADE OUR BED WITH THE 'STAINED' SHEET THAT WAS STILL IN OUR ROOM. I would like to know how they washed the 'stained' sheet when they never even reemoved it from our room. He finally agreed that if we can remove the stains they would not charge us, just before assuring us \"they use top of the line appliances and can assure us the stain will not come out of their bedsheets imported from China.\" We then took MORE time out of our vacation to waste MORE money to bring to the cleaners, which is conveniently right next door...? The cleaners giggled to themselves when we explained the situation. They told us they deal with the same situations from the hotel guests regularly and assured us they could get it out.

First and foremost, the rate was very reasonable to the average traveler and totally fabulous for us, because we are very familiar with the competition and their rates during March. I can't say enough about the prime location (just two blocks off of Duval), the BEAUTIFUL rooms, LOVED the bedding! Loved the cleanliness and \"GREEN\" concept. The housekeepers worked their butt's off keeping up with the messy spring breakers....man...I hope someone besides us left them a good tip. God bless the housekeeping staff! Speaking of spring breakers, the staff handled the groups well and we lucked out being on the other side of the property. All in all the kids were well-behaved and fun to watch when we weren't sunning on the most fabulous lawn chairs on the island! A fabulous continental breakfast was ready for us every morning served by the lovely Miss Erin. She knew I loved my morning milk! Peter and Vitale always aimed to please and were soooo kind and courteous! I was able to use a complimentary laptop in the lobby and they printed out my boarding passes for me as well. Can't say enough about our deck! So tough to get a beautiful room with a deck! If you've never been to Key West, you don't know the dumps you can end up in , even at the most expensive resort on the island who has a beach, but the crappiest rooms for the premium price you pay. So my friends.....If you want to experience Key West at an affordable, plush but cozy property......Silver Palms is the place to be.

Let me break it down: The good: The room was nice, new and clean with plenty of space and a bed that was just fine with contemporary, clean linens and pretty colors. Check in and check out was extremely fast, efficient and friendly. There is a $100 security deposit when you check in, but this wasn't a big deal for us. The not so good: - The hotel's location: if you choose a \"streetview balcony\" prepare to overlook a dingy laundromat or some tiny, crappy houses. It's an easy walk to Duval, but still a walk, so if being within steps of the action is a concern for you, this may not be the best place. The bf and I are in good shape and we don't mind walking, so this was fine for us, but we both said we would have preferred being a tad bit closer. I like to wear high heels, and the extra few steps made me think twice about it. - Outdoor corridors: this hotel had them, which isn't my favorite. - Creative photography: this is much smaller than the photos online, particularly the pool area, as others have noted. A $10 resort fee really isn't a big deal to me, but if you are someone who is concerned about this, there really isn't anything warranting it at this hotel. Definitely not a resort, more of a Best Western. - Thin walls. We could hear the maids walking by every morning, cleaning the adjoining rooms (yes, our room had a door to another room attached, which I kind of hate), and we could hear general street noise. This probably isn't the place for light sleepers. - There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom and ours definitely had a gross, light mildew odor going on. - This is a \"green\" hotel, meaning you have to put your room key in a slot near the door to make the power in the room work. I hate to say this, but this is one example where I think \"green\" really means \"hotel trying to save money on the electric bill.\" In all, this hotel was just fine, and while I probably wouldn't stay here again, I might if the price was right. To reiterate: it was clean, the rooms were spacious and the location was pretty good. The bf and I usually try to stay in four-star places when we go out of town, though, and this was just more of a true three-star, on par with a basic Holiday Inn or Best Western. So, if you're just looking for a place to sleep, this is a fine choice. If you're looking to enjoy some upscale amenities, this probably isn't the place for you.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spring Hill, Florida", "Title": "\u201cBrand new and convienient to everything!\u201d", "Author": "jxs324", "ReviewID": "UR96805757", "Content": "We stayed at the Silver Palms Inn and could not have been more pleased.

We had high hopes, but as soon as we \"checked in\" ,we decided to review this place from top to bottom. The less- than-friendly desk clerk was not enthusiastic and seemed to \"care less' whether we were there or not. He was more concerned with getting us to sign that we were responsible if we \"broke\" something and that we agreed to a daily \"resort fee.\" When we asked why we would be charged a \"resort fee\", we were told it was for use of the pool. Well, our Michelin Travel Dctionary defines a \"resort\" as something more than this motel on stilts with a pool in the middle of the parking lot. The last time we checked, a \"resort\" has a beach, golf and tennis courses, spa, and many other amenities--not to mention beautiful views. The front view of this \"resort\" is the busy and noisy Truman Avenue and the back of this \"resort\" looks to be a prime spot for a trailer park. It a basic motel on stilts that has been made \"Key Westy\" with a tin roof and blue canvas window canapies. It was also \"slim pickins\" at breakfast. Toast, bagels, and some cereal about sums it up--and orange juice in some \"mouth wash\" size plastic cups. There was some fresh fruit---over ripe black bananas and a couple of apples. On the good side, the beds were comfortable and the linens were crisp and new. The soap and shampoo are packaged to look like \"boutique\" products when actually they are cheap knock-offs made in China. We give this place a \"average\" when compared to everything else in Key West, and a well \"below average\" to the seasoned traveler who knows the difference between a resort and a motel on stilts with a staff in Hawaiian shirts.", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Petaluma, California", "Title": "\u201cPretty rooms-noisy street\u201d", "Author": "milosmomma", "ReviewID": "UR94986804", "Content": "Stayed three nights in January.

One night we even rented bikes, which was suggested by the front desk. My friend and I were there for a wedding which was at the Casa Marina. All of our friends ended up staying at the Casa Marina, which is very costly for being a \"resort.\" Silver Palms was definately more affordable and our room was more spacious and decorated more appropriately for an island get-a-way. Many of our friends actually regretted not staying at the Silver Palms because of the heated pool, the free breakfast, and the size of the rooms. The breakfast isn't your typical continenta breakfast but its suitable for getting you through until lunch. The only negative about this hotel is the outside noise. Our room faced a neighboorhood off of Truman and every morning between 5-7 we had roosters crowing beneath our balcony. We thought it was rather humerous. We liked waking up early in order to take advantage of the day. At night, we looked foward to going back to our room because our bed was extremely comfortable. I hadn't slept that well in a while.

Cab to Mallory square was about $7-$8 depending on the driver. The pool heater was broken our entire stay. I tried to get in one afternoon but could not bear the cold! The elevator was being repaired outside our room and the gentleman repairing it talked ALL DAY and it was all we could hear from our room for hours on end (I unfortunately was not feeling well and had to spend some of one day in our room).

When we questioned why a walk-up got a better rate than someone who booked online, ahead of time, we were simply told, that's the way it is! Had we of known, we would have just waited! We couldn't just cancel then and walk in again and re-book, because they have a 72-hr cancellation policy.
