It also has the usual European shower which no matter how hard you try not to, manages to flood the bathroom floor. Will they ever discover shower doors? If you don't need the net or dodn't need the ice and dodn't mind a flooded bathroom floor then this is a great place.

So it started out bad and we became a bit picky but at \u20ac140/$190 with no breakfast included I felt it was all a bit rich for what i was getting. 'Interesting location' - the Hotel is located in a gay district of Berlin so therefore there are plenty - I mean plenty - of gay clothing shops displaying their 'wares', gay bars and clubs nearby. Our friend was offered 'sex' by a street worker as he came to join us in a wine bar on Maa\u00dfenstra\u00dfe. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry! Good location - it's beside the U-bahn, KaDeWe and plenty of restaurants Externally the hotel looks great. Inside, the open plan space combining reception, lounge area and breakfast room hints that you will not be hanging around here more so just sleeping here. Going upstairs you find the corridors are very narrow and resulting walls being chipped and worn. The cleaning staff have no room to manoeuvre their trolleys or place their fresh towels or sheets. The result is a visual unwelcoming mess. In the bedroom the white carpet was manky with stains, nearly all the furniture was chipped and worn, the complimentary bathroom cosmetics were half filled/used and one of the towels was ripped. All these small things coming at once made a poor impression. Lastly, the following morning while my wife was showering, her hair full of shampoo, the hot and cold water suddenly stopped for a full 20 minutes. That was the last straw for my wife and she complained to the manager and he agreed and offered a 50% refund. In summary the hotel staff were very kind and understanding, the hotel itself just needs some TLC and it would be a great spot.

I shared the room with a close friend. When you enter the l obby on street level, the hotel appears to be modern and with more of a design flair. Keep in mind this is still a mid range hotel, not a luxury or boutique hotel. So as long as you go in with that expectation, you will probably be mildly satisfied. You should know that the rooms are SMALL. I had one of the larger rooms which I had booked way in advance so it was ok for two people. It was a triple room. However. The triple simply mean two people could be on the main bed, and the third would be on the pull out sofa. This was actually called the \"luxury triple\" - I do not know what made this a luxury room. The television was an older model, not the LCD flat panel shown on the web site, so that was misleading. This particular room was in the basement, and they have 3 or 4 other rooms down there - there are half windows that bring in light from the street but the rooms are basically darker. The furnishings are showing signs of wear and tear. There is a safe in the closet and a small minibar. There was no bottle opener to open any of the bottles (they are not pop tops). The air conditioning was iffy at best too. I finally said something to the front desk and they said that it may have been turned off. Once she checked, it seemed to work fine, so double check that if you think it is not working - it may simply have been shut off from the master controls. The bathroom was ok. They have a large toiletry dispenser that contains the shower/body gel as one type of gel. I didn't eat breakfast at the hotel ever. Yu can pay \u20ac10 per person daily if you decide to do so, but there are so many great places to get food in the neighborhood that you don't need to worry. Wifi is free, but it had several problems through the days I stayed whee it would just simply go off. I travel with a small travel wifi router that plugs into a wall socket for a LAN connection as an alternative that usually works fine - in this case, the hotel did have wall jacks for a LAN connection so I solved the problem for myself. The front desk staff has been good about calling taxis. But beyond that, you should probably have your own tours and guidebooks pre-arranged. The location is very convenient to shops, Restaurants and not far from KaDeWe department store. You can easily walk there. It is also close to the Ubahn stop at Nollendorfplatz. All in all, this was an ok hotel for the price, location, and amenities. It wasn't luxury, but it wasn't a dump either. Would I stay here again?

You had to call reception and they would fix the problem, but you should not be in a hurry. I thought the beds were very uncomfortable, very hard, like sleeping on a wooden board. In a double room you only get one bedlamp, so only one person can read. The furnishings looked tired and dilapidated. The biggest problem was, that the aircon was not switched on. It was unbearably warm in my room. I asked reception several times to switch on the aircon, but they did not do so. I stayed with friends in this hotel, their rooms were also unbearably warm and they also asked for the aircon to be switched on. Nothing happend. After five days in this hotel it was enough, I checked out. I did not get a refund for the last two nights. I will never stay in this hotel of in hotels of this group again.

The hotel is in a quiet residential area in the Sch\u00f6neburg area of Berlin, near Nollendorfplatz U-Bahn station. Housed in an old, five-storey building this modern hotel has recently been renovated throughout and is furnished to a high standard. Our room was a luxury double on the fifth floor, which was in the roof of the building. The room had a large, comfortable bed, flat screen television and well appointed bathroom. The mini-bar was reasonably priced; the wardrobe contained a safe and although not very big, there was plenty of storage for clothes there and in two sets of drawers. Standard double rooms are slightly smaller. The bathroom had a large window into the bedroom, which contained an electronically-controlled venetian blind for privacy. Although a nice design feature, allowing lots of light into the bathroom, we kept the blinds closed all of the time. The hotel only caters for breakfast; we chose not to eat in the hotel, preferring to find something whilst out during the day. Breakfast would likely be the usual continental/German affair: cold meats, cheese, cereals, croissants and fruit. The hotel doesn\u2019t have a bar. The area around Nollendorfplatz is widely regarded as Berlin\u2019s gay hotspot although Berlin is a pretty easy-going city anyway. Near to the hotel are plenty of bars and restaurants, as well as more \u201cspecialist\u201d gay venues. That is not to say the area is at all seedy - the relaxed nature of the city means these places are dotted all over the city. The U-bahn at Nollendorfplatz is served by three lines giving easy access to the rest of Berlin. The journey from here to Potsdamer Platz is approximately 10 minutes by U-bahn. The Ku\u2019damm, Berlin\u2019s famous shopping street similar to Oxford Street in London is a 10 minute walk away. Our room was \u20ac135 per night. We booked directly with the hotel via their web site as their prices were, strangely, slightly cheaper than those offered by the usual booking sites.

But there is not even an option to book an \"economy double room\" on the webpage, which she did not believe. Luckily I had my laptop so I showed her the webpage - and the pictures that are behind the roomtypes and asked for the room on the picture. That night she had none, but I got a nice large room next night. On checking out there was some trouble with the bill (room was 5 EUR more expensive per night), which was corrected after I pointed it out. What I didn't argue to them was that on the hotel's webpage the rate is 75 EUR, but on the confirmation that I was sent by mail, it was already 79 EUR, and in the end they wanted to charge me 84 EUR. So - always check your confirmations:) which I did only on check out. Since our hopes were quite high (based on the picture on the webpage) we were very disappointed the first night. The small room wasn't bad, but I hoped to get something else. If they have more of these rooms, they could just sell it as a SGL or make an extra option to book an \"economy double room\" to the webpage with the picture of it.

HOTEL Hotel is very modern and stylish. Staff is helpful. It is exactly like on the hotel official pictures. ROOM There are many disputes about the rooms. First again it is exactly like on the hotel official pictures. If you like modern design you will definitely like it. Window between bathroom and bedroom is excellent. We had no problem with the hot water as it was mentioned in other reviews and hot water was available anytime after few seconds. It is true that the doors slams loudly and there is a wooden floor on the hallway. We knew that from the reviews so we tried to walk silently and do not slam the doors. Wherever you stay it is always about tolerance to you neighbors. We had no problem and didn\u2019t hear any noise and did not wake up in the night. The beds are nice and not hard as there was a complaint in another previous review. It is true that carpet has some stains. But it is not really dirty and it is cleaned by house keepers, but it will be a miracle to keep white carpet white forever in a hotel. BREAKFAST The breakfast is in the hotel lobby.

I decided to take a chance and I'm happy that I did. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a really nice hotel and very stylish. The lobby and rooms are very nice. They are decorated in a modern design. Simple and clean lined furniture and some cool details. The bathroom has a window into the bedroom. It had electric blinds in between the panes of glass to close the two rooms off from one another. There is a mirror on rollers that rolls from the back of the tub along the bathroom wall. This way you can position it where ever you want it. The hotel is very clean and well taken care of. I found the staff to be very nice and professional. They were always helpful. When I asked if they knew the weather forecast for the next day the receptionist immediately looked it up online. When I mentioned I would be checking out the next morning the receptionist offered to order a car for me. These may not seem like huge things but after some of the reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. Some of the negative things that I read here I will partially agree with. One, The floor in the hallway is wood. You do sometimes hear people on your floor walking down the hall. Also, I did occasionally hear other peoples doors slam. Two, The beige carpet in my room was a bit dirty. I found everything else very, very clean. All of the furnishings were in excellent condition. I personally don't think that it is anything more than light carpeting in an area with heavy traffic.The last thing was the hot water. The water didn't always come out hot immediately. However it never took more than a few minutes of letting it run to get hot water. This hotel is in a really charming area. There are several restaurants within a short walk.

Two of us, in two different rooms both asked if all the beds in the hotel were the same, in the hope of being able to ask to change rooms. Instead of a sympathetic smile and a \"sorry, they are all the same\" we got \"it's a matter of taste\" and a smirk.

I asked the receptionist if she would leave her colleague a message but it seems she didn't. The beds are really really hard. I couldn't get much sleep and was so stiff in the morning I could barely bend down to put my shoes on. Then we came to check out we were expected to pay for the night we weren't going to use and told rudely that \"if you book a package holiday to Mallorca and go home early you don't expect a refund\". I explained politely that the hotel was not a package holiday to Mallorca and that we were not satisfied with the beds and had been forced to look for other accommodation. Eventually our bills were adjusted - extremely reluctantly. The worst point came however, when another guest who was waiting at reception tried to ask a very quick question. The receptionist glared at him like a schoolteacher would look at a naughty child and told him to wait. I felt sorry for him and almost apologised for the receptionist's attitude. The only good thing about this hotel is the location and the housekeeper who was very friendly. However I can only recommend her to find another place to work before the hotel closes down.
