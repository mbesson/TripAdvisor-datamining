Arrivals/departures, guest requests, yet everything is under control and service is very efficient. Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped (particularly with alcohol - enough to knock you out for a couple of days). Views from the rooms are spectacular, thanks to floor to ceiling windows, although you might feel you are on view to the world, this is not the case during the day due to the tinted glass, but the lower floors are visible at night if the room is lit. The room was clean, but there were a couple of details that could be improved - a stray cloth left on a table and pistachio nut shells under the bed. A special word for the bar on the 26th floor which hosted an Easter party during our stay. Great cocktails, wonderful atmosphere (people were queuing in the lobby for quite some time) and the light food menu we sampled was quite delicious and great value for money. Breakfast was a little disappointing, the simple black coffee ordered arrived decaffinated with milk for some strange reason and getting a refill was a little arduous. Hot food required paying a supplement. However, at check-out when we indicated the cleaning problem, the breakfast was offered as a compensation gesture. Although a little too cold to sample the outdoor pool in April, the terrasse and loungers are a great way to laze through the day: good ambiance music, service is faultless and from time to time staff come around with extras (glasses of water, ice-creams...) - a nice touch.

When you can say a hotel added to the enjoyment of your vacation, you know that they are doing things right. The rooms are set up with the bed facing the Mediterranean. You pull the curtains back in the morning, and are treated to a wonderful view. Great way to start the day. The rooms have all the conveniences, and the bathrooms offer plenty of space. Housekeeping kept everything spotless. My only complaint is that it took me two days to figure out how to turn on/off all of the mood lighting. With a little effort, you can create a very romantic atmosphere once you get the lighting down. My wife and i especially liked the comfort of the bed and the unique \"couch\" that runs the length of the wall-to-wall picture window. We would come back from sightseeing, stretch out and relax on that couch while looking out at the sea. A great way to renew your energy for the evening activities. We two dinners and all breakfast in the restaurant. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. If you wanted eggs on the cold breakfast buffet, you had only to ask. The lobby bar was excellent with many groupings for seating; you can also have light meals there. Like all W properties the decor is modern and uncluttered throughout. The location of the hotel is a bit removed from the main sites, but is just a short cab ride away. There are also buses that run to the hotel area. Finally, the best part of our stay at the W Hotel Barcelona was our interaction with the staff. There was not a single moment when there was an absence of warmth, gracious hospitality, and quick response to a request.

It was our first visit to Barcelona. We had two rooms. We were on vacation with our youngest daughter who is studying in Seville for the Spring term, one of her friends from home, and our oldest daughter. Like many reviewers here, I had concerns prior to our arrival about the atmosphere, the location, and the bathrooms in the hotel. I suggest that future readers keep these things in mind. 1. This is a W hotel. It is similar to other W hotels we have stayed in, in the US. It is very modern. It attracts a young crowd. The lighting can be non-conventional (different colors in the bar, few overhead lights in the rooms etc.) But it is sleek and fun. 2. Barcelona has an excellent bus and subway system. There are three bus lines that begin their routes in front of the hotel; all of them will take you to the metro. You can also take the buses directly to many of the popular sites in the city. You can take the bus down the street and connect to the metro. If you buy a T-10 ticket at the metro you can use it on both the bus and the metro, and the price per ride is reduced. Because the W is NOT centrally located, you should plan some transit time to get places. It is a 20 minute walk from the metro to the hotel. But the trade off is that transportation options are good, and you are on the beach. We did not have good weather during our visit, but the beach and the ocean were always beautiful. We found it very easy to get around Barcelona. 3. The bathrooms. We were upgraded to two \"Fabulous\" category rooms which each included a jetted tub, a very large separate rain shower stall and a toilet. Both the shower and the toilet had tall frosted glass walls. Can you see inside? No. Does it take a little getting used to? Yes. BUT, the shower makes up for everything. It was the best one I have ever used. The shower space was large, the water was hot (we were on the 21st floor) and with the dark tile floor you had the sense that you were showering outside, after a sandy beach visit. Other reviewers have mentioned service issues. The rain shower option (you can opt for a hand held shower attachment) did not work in the first room my daughters were staying in. We asked the front desk for assistance twice. The first time an employee immediately came up to the room and looked at the shower. He got on his cell phone and dialed for help - we left for our sightseeing. When we returned there was no improvement. We asked for help a second time. Still no rain shower option. I asked if we could have another room. No problem. My daughters packed their bags and left them by the door in the morning. Their bags were moved to a new room by the time we returned to the hotel to change for dinner. Everyone we dealt with at the hotel spoke beautiful English, (I am a non-Spanish speaker), and was very helpful. We did not eat at the hotel because the prices were too high. We walked along the beach and ate at some of the little restaurants near the water, or took the bus back towards the nearest metro stop (Barceloneta) and wandered around the alleyways and squares nearby for some delicious meals that were well priced. We found the free internet in the lobby worked very well, as did the four terminals in the business center. The free and delicious coffee (maybe it was really espresso?) available at the end of the bar in the lobby each morning, gave us the energy to find a beachfront breakfast. And the cold water dispenser at the end of the whatever desk was refreshing when we returned to the hotel. One of my daughters said that the work out room (Sweat) had the best view ever. This hotel worked well for us. It really enhanced our visit to Barcelona.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kilmarnock", "Title": "\u201cBarcelona with a WOW at the W\u201d", "Author": "Chris C", "ReviewID": "UR127878496", "Content": "Hotel is beautiful with everything you could possibly need and even if there is something they will get it for you.

First of all,the arrangement of the loo in our room being behind a glass screen that opened directly into the room was somewhat daunting and you need to share a room with someone that you know very well, I won't go into too much detail. We arranged for tea making facilities to be sent to the room, we initially had 2 tea bags and when we asked for some more we were told that there would be a charge of 4.5 euros PER BAG and they also wanted to charge 5 euros for a very small jug of milk.The other issue on cost was the fact that the hotel charges 5 euros for the 1st hour for using wi-fi in the room, not something that I would expect from a hotel of this quality. After a few phone calls to the management we were told that we would not be charged for the tea or the milk,I would think so too, bearing in mind that this is a 5 star hotel. The staff with one exception were very friendly and helpful, the exception being the guy on the Concierge Desk who was neither friendly or helpful, I got the distinct impression that he thought he was doing us a favour by just being there The room was great apart from the loo, the beds were superb and gave us great sleep quality, we also had a wonderful view of the harbour, with so much going on. One other point was that we found out that there is only one room per floor with a bath, which again is a bit strange for a quality hotel The breakfasts were ok but as we had recently stayed at The Cliff Bay Hotel in Madeira, they not as good as we had expected. I have to say that breakfast at The Cliff is probably the best that we have ever had anywhere. The hotel is in a good location, there is a bus stop just at the entrance. The no 37 bus takes you into the main part of the City for 2 euros, whereas a taxi is about 10 euros. We got a taxi from the airport to the hotel for 40 euros but on the way back got the Airport shuttle bus from the main square at the top of La Ramblas for only 6 euros each, they run every 7 minutes or so. Much better value. We both loved Barcelona, especially my wife who has never seen so many Zara's in one place,needless to say, several hours were spent buying clothes. My wife assured me that they are a lot cheaper than in the UK, which in fact they are. Sadly I am too old for the Zara mens section.

Arriving on Sunday afternoon for a four-night stay, check-in was swift and despite my request for a high floor room (there are 26 storeys in this hotel), the lady at reception could only give me one on the second floor. Still, the room itself was big, well appointed and had great views of the mediterranean (as do most of the rooms). I did have some trouble finding basic things like the safe and the hairdryer but the staff on the Whatever/Whenever hotline soon pointed me in the right direction. The bed was very comfortable and I couldn't drag myself out of it most days, plus the bathroom/wetroom was fun with the rainfall shower. There was no bathtub in my room, but I didn't miss it, and I loved the Bliss products that they give you (very lemony and zesty). Lovely. Plus, I checked out the gym (they call it Sweat - nice...) which was very good complete with water fountains, changing areas, lockers and all the apparatus you would expect. Be warned, you need your room key to access the E floor which is where Sweat is located. However, there were some flaws with my stay, simple things that the hotel management should work on. These are: 1. Internet access in the room. Wireless is provided by DoCoMo and it is a royal rip-off for the internet speeds you get. 19 Euros per 24 hours and the speed was so slow that I had to take my laptop and stand by my hotel door (other side of the room) to get any half-decent speed. Be warned. 2. The mini-bar. As I have said on other reviews, it never ceases to amaze me what hotels want to charge you for a drink in your room. While it was fun to have martini glasses and bottles of gin and vodka on show, there was no way I was going to help myself and be billed outrageous prices. And yet, when I did check out, a mini-bar bill showed up on the final account. Still, the guy at reception waived the 36 Euros that they wanted to bill me without hesitation. 3. The Eclipse bar on the 26th floor. When I checked in I was given a pass to bypass any lines to get into the express elevator up to the Eclipse bar, but to be honest I never needed it as I was there in the week. I imagine it gets busier at the weekend. While the bar itself affords wonderful views of the city of Barcelona (especially at night), there is absolutely zero atmosphere and the lighting system turns the entire bar either pink or purple. Hideous. I can think of better places to sup a 14 Euro cocktail. By all means, check it out, but I tell you that you won't stay for long. In fact, the first time I walked in the bar, it felt like a dirty student bar from my college days. Not what you would expect from the W. 4. Overcharging at the bar. On the first two nights, I went to the bar on the ground floor with a co-worker and no less that three occasions the bar staff tried to overcharge us for our drinks. When I queried why they had charged for doubles instead of singles or why they had charged for a 21 yr old malt when I was drinking a basic blended scotch, the staff merely smiled and made their excuses and then rectified the charge. One wonders how many people just sign off their bar bills without giving them a second glance. So, do check your bar bills before tipping and signing. Needless to say, I waived any tips when my bar bill was wrong. 5. Whatever/whenever line. While this is usually a good service (as mentioned before), when I rang to ask for help with my luggage, no-one picked up the phone. This happened again and again over a 30 minute period. When I called the concierge and explained that no-one was picking up the W/W phone calls, he apologized and sent up the porter.

The level of detail which has gone into the structure, the food, the staff, the rooms, the beds, the bathrooms (I could go on) is befitting it's 5 star recommendation. The staff are extremely friendly and are the core reason behind me not slating this hotel completely. Despite arriving at 5pm they still didn't have a room available when I arrived. On top of this the room they did find me (18th floor with stunning view) was taken away from me when a \"more important\" customer requested it. I quickly learnt you needn't get hung up on which floor you're on, above the 4rd you already have stunning vistas of the beach and the sea and Barceloneta region, unless you're on the full half of the hotel with a view of the docks, not too pretty! The rooms .....while luxurious still have no free wi-fi, you need to pay \u20ac5 per hour for snail slow connections (3 minutes to load gmail). The food ......while delicious is overpriced, as are the cocktails in the stunning and exclusive eclipse bar on the roof (34th floor with a view). The pool ....was not heated and therefore ont one person used it and once again, they're let down by the fact they charge you to use their underground Jacuzzi and Steam facilities (\u20ac20 per day!!) The staff ..... undoubtably the saving grace who, despite setbacks in broken amenities and room facilities (air con not working, no iron then replacement didn't work, hammering at 9am from the room below, Jacuzzi broken down, pool not heated, wi-fi broken). They great you with a smile and though no compensation is offered for these setbacks you are met with an apology and they always followed up to see if the issue had been resolved. In closing this place is beautiful, it has great staff, the food is great and the rooms are luxurious but they need to stop charging for everything they possibly can.

The scene a little further up the beach is interesting to say the least, but we felt like we were in our own little world on our beach chairs in front of the hotel. An added plus is the beach recliners are complimentary, unlike many European hotels, so we didn't feel like we needed to make a full or half day commitment to sitting on the beach. At night, the pool area is a trendy spot to grab a drink before heading out for dinner and the clubs. What I like about this hotel is that it's trendy and chic without being silly and pretentious. It is like staying in a resort in the middle of a lovely, historical city.

Afterward we've got a spanish menu although we spoke english during the whole lunch. We were not asked if we liked our meal and that after waiting half an our to have our plates moved off ( only 3 tables were occupied at the restaurant and they were 4 people working). But I have to say that the meals were really nice an I would recommand the risotto. I was also disappointed by the Eclipse Bar. We were tol by the concierge that we had to take drink for a value of 180\u20ac if we want a table. We did this and stayed at the bar until 2 a.m.and there were only 5 of the 14 tables of the bar having a bottle for that prices other tables were occupied with people who drank a beer.

This was really a shame for a 5 star hotel. An other negative point of the hotel is its location. The hotel is located 25 minutes from city centre by walk and 5-10 minutes by taxi.

We had stayed in two other hotels during our stay but wanted to use this one for the last night as it was kind of out of the way for this time of year, but looked interesting. My big beef with this hotel is that their computers were down when we arrived, as well as when we left - they never presented an agreement of what I was paying, nor provided me with an invoice at departure or EVEN after charging my credit card - yet I gave them my email and asked them to do so but have never received it. My interaction with front desk staff and watching others interact with concierge staff (Whenever / Whatever Desk as they call it) was that the Whenever / Whatever is supposed to describe the guests feeling while staying at this hotel, yet I think that perhaps it has gotten into the staffs head as to how they interact with clients instead. The service level was not up to what I expected - no one was rude, but I might call it short - or semi attentive as one might be when they have too many things to do and are trying to move things along. Arrival: Room not ready - 3pm check in - it was pushing 5pm when we got our room. Given 2 drinks (wine or beer) and thats it - described as welcome drinks not drinks for not having the room ready. The design of the hotel was magnificent - stunning. From the entrance, to the \"Living Room\" interfacing with the beach, to the corridors of hotel rooms above. This is the place to stay in the summer when going to the warm beach (as opposed to our cool winter visit) with lots of free cash to spend for drinks and food. We had a Fabulous room - we had an SPG Gold card but it was never aknowledged nor any benefit derived from having it during our entire stay. (Perhaps the computers, but should computers be that necessary?!) The Faubulous room was on the 17th floor and faced the city / beach view to the northeast. It has not bathtup, which I would expect at this level of hotel - but it was nice none the less. The corridor end of the room had three frosted/etched glass compartments, one for entry, one for wc, and one for shower. There was a sink / makup area on the side of the room near the shower, then a desk facing the window but behind the bed, then the bed, then a nice lounge seat at the window with TV nearby. Nice lighting effects as well as a color changing by remote control RGB led light. One NEGATIVE here is that you could not hear the ocean as none of the windows were operable (why stay at the beach?) - I would have expected perhaps horizontal slit venting windows so one could at least hear the ocean. We had a snack in the Living Room - a burger - which was good. Had some glasses of wine here and one mojito - cost of drinks seemed high for what you got - staff was attentive. Some of the Living Room was roped off for an event - there was a shortage of places to sit - this was annoying at this level of hotel - if they need to close an area they should have adequate meeting space to use for that purpose. Tried the bar at the top level - again an area was closed off. DId not readily see a way to gain any sort of balcony access anywhere at the hotel - was expecting some kind of outdoor space at the top. We had sushi here (which we paid for directly as they had issues with billing to our room due to the computers) and some glasses of wine. It was good and not too loud or clubish so you could hold a conversation. Beds / bedding were nice, toiletries nice from the Bliss Spa in the hotel, Woke up at 06:30 to a morning glow - the sun seem to rise near 7:45 as we left our room. At check out we were unable to pay our bill, nor review it. They took our credit card numbers which they have since charged as well as our email address which they indicated they would send a copy of the bill to. Have not yet received a copy of the bill. The surronds of this hotel are failry sparce - the beach is the attraction. It is likely a 20 to 30 minute walk to get to the main drags of the city (we took cabs) - but walking along the beach would not be so bad in warm weather. There is a overhead cable car nearby with limited winter hours that you can take over to Montjuic Hill. The cable car is about 1/2 way to the nearest metro stop Barceloneta This hotel is a very nice facility, I might try it again in the summertime, but I would expect a higher level of service being a guest here than I got for the price. I felt more like I was in a bar with an attitude than a hotel - though again everyone was very nice - just seemed to be semi attentive and did not feel like a hotel catering to all of its guests.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cali", "Title": "\u201cService is good not great, worst elevator system I've ever experienced\u201d", "Author": "stregis_11", "ReviewID": "UR125239058", "Content": "This hotel is great but the service isn't polished yet, I called the bellman 2 times to move my luggage to my room because my room wasn't ready yet, 45 minutes later I decided to make 3 trips up to my room. 2nd possible improvement is their elevator system, it's programmed to open for like 2 seconds and there are four of them across the hall from each other so if you miss it and each of us (3) staying in different rooms all had the same problem.

On arrival we had an extremely prompt check in (by the very helpful Jacopo) and although we were 3 hours ahead of our actual check-in time, we were very kindly allowed to go straight to our room. The room itself lived up to its 'Fabulous' name tag, with stunning views of the beach, city and sea. The chaise lounge style seating area under the window was a great touch, along with the electric curtains (nice if you don\u2019t want to leave your bed), mood lighting, work station, and cocktail making kit. The wet room was great, very spacious with a rain style shower head, 2 dressing gowns, slippers and plenty of fresh, fluffy towels. All the toiletries are courtesy of the Bliss range (Bliss Spa downstairs) and restocked on a daily basis. We had breakfast in the Wave restaurant which had a good variety of continental style breakfast (fresh croissants, cheeses, hams, jams, fruit etc) and also well presented traditional, Spanish style omlettes with fresh coffee, tea, smoothies and juice - needless to say we didn\u2019t go hungry. We loved the hotel so much that we were reluctant to go out on the first evening so we booked (by recommendation) to eat at the hotel restaurant, Bravo. The decor was beautiful and we had a table overlooking the terrace and sea. The food and service was amazing along and we were spoilt for choice with an extensive wine and champagne list. I would definitely recommend eating here. After that we decided it would be rude not to hang out in the lounge (opposite the wave restaurant), to have a few cocktails. We picked a comfy sofa right next to the rather funky looking fireplace. The DJ was playing chilled house music (if you like that sort of thing) and we had an attentive waiter who kept us topped up with many Polish Madame\u2019s (a highly recommended cocktail!) After this we took the dedicated lift up to the Eclipse Bar on the 26 floor and again we were not disappointed! The view over the beach, city and sea is amazing, music was great and we even got a seat in the VIP area! I don't have a bad word to say about this hotel, I actually quite liked the fact that we were not right in the middle of La Rambla (which was only a short \u20ac5/6 cab ride away). Those with good legs could probably walk there in about 20/25 mins which on a good day isn\u2019t that bad at all!

A couple of things I would point out though. The hotel is about 20-30 minute walk from Barcelona town. We are quite fit but after walking around Barcelona all day and walking back to the hotel, we could not be bothered to walk back into town for dinner as we were too tired. The hotel is very trendy and I enjoyed it...however we sometimes take my parents on holiday with us and I think that in this case they would not have enjoyed it as they are in their late 70's.

This made my mother very uncomfortable and it was completely inexcusable because we were travelling in the low season and I made reservations several months in advance through the platinum guest concierage, No other hotel had trouble with this simple request during my two week trip Both rooms had mechanical problems. In my mother's room the sink and remote controlled curtains didn't work and in my room the shower didn't work and leaked rusty water. The windows were dirty and there was a dead pigeon, bird crap and annoying bright beacon outside my window.

The rooms have min-bars but everything in them is barely below room temperature. If you need ice, you have to call room service and have them bring it up. There was no upgrade per platinum standards as indicated in one of the other reviews--hopefully the pictures prove this. I can't imagine they have a worse room. I've stayed in W hotels in the U.S. and I thought they were all suites. My rooms were definitely not suites. I gave them my debit card for incidental charges and they withdrew and held 1800 euros (over $2300) from my checking account without telling me in advance (this was to reserve two rooms for 3 nights each). The money wasn't returned to my account until 3 days after my stay. I actually could go on but I won't other than to say the manager woudn't even talk to me when I complained at the front desk. The desk did offer me a free breakfast (which costs about $40 a person in this hotel). Otherwise they didn't address my needs. Advice; 1) Do not stay in Starwood hotels with recommend rates below 70% like this one. But if you must: 2) Do not stay below the 10th floor in this hotel. 3) Stay in rooms far from the elevator (numbers above XX6) 4) Do not reserve rooms with points or they will treat you like a freeloader. 5) The hotel and bar caters to the under 30 crowd, If you like nicer bars and restaurants, you will not want to eat or drink in the hotel. 6) Visit Madrid instead of Barcelona and stay at the Westin Palace--a far superior hotel.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cW Barcelona is Wonderful indeed!\u201d", "Author": "DJtravels", "ReviewID": "UR124594225", "Content": "I had the Pleasure of staying at the W Barcelona from Feb. 10 - Feb. 13, 2012. We were a group of six consisting of 3 couples of varying travel experiences. Every single person in the group fell Absolutely in LOVE with both the City of Barcelona and the W! Staff: I must start this review by complimenting the Wonderful, Fabulous staff at the W. Every person that we came into contact with was friendly and efficient. I thought it was absolutely fascinating that very few of the W's employees were actually FROM Spain, so I took the time to ask about their journeys to Barcelona, and we were always treated to interesting, fun conversations. Truly, everyone was great, but My personal favorites were Moses (France/Senegal), Francilia (Argentina), Wan (China), Alex (Brazil), Yusef (Spain, actually LOL). I was also very impressed by the Wonderful woman at the Concierge desk who took special care to explain where to go, where to eat, and took care of our every need. (I'm so sorry that I didn't get her name, but she is the lady at the WHATEVER desk with the beautiful curly hair!). We also Really loved Joey, the Lobby DJ (from Chicago). Each of these people made our trip Very special and I THANK THEM for making us feel at home! Atmosphere: We traveled in the middle of winter, so we didn't get to experience the pool/beach, etc. But, the entire hotel's cool vibe and trendy atmosphere made us want to come back in warmer weather. During the day, our group split up to explore on our own, but we all came back together in the evening for \"Happy Hour\". After long days of walking and exploring, it was Wonderful to come back \"home\" to the W, have some drinks and relax. Location: Absolutely stunning location on the beach/boardwalk. It is a bit of a walk into the main sections of Barcelona, but the walk is well worth it. Barcelona itself is a beautiful city and it was lovely to explore on foot. We did take occasional taxis back to the W at night and the cost was never more 9 euro. Room: We had a Fabulous Room on the seventh floor and the name is quite Appropriate! From the moment that I walked in and saw the stunning view of the boardwalk, the city and the beach, I knew I was in love! The hardest part of the first night was tearing ourselves away from the window seats and actually leaving the room. The bed and the shower, like in all W hotels, are Simply Heavenly also! Although I did enjoy the ultra modern furnishing of the room, I will admit that the all glass doors on the bathrooms may be a bit disconcerting for friends traveling together. Food: 1. The only meal that we didn't absolutely love was the Continental Breakfast at the Wave restaurant. The price of the meal did not reflect the true value. After the first meal at the Wave Restaurant, we discovered that the Wave Bar has a light breakfast menu and we ate every other morning meal there. The food was MUCH cheaper and much heartier. I Highly recommend the Egg sandwich served with bacon and cheese! They also offer omelettes, pastries and other selections. Dinner at the Wave restaurant made up for ANY disappointment felt at breakfast. Every meal was beautifully prepared, wonderfully seasoned and served to perfection. My favorites were the Chilean Sea Bass and the Lamb Shank. In fact, these were so good that we ordered them twice in 2 days! Another exceptional part of the W Barcelona experience were the lovely drinks served at the hotel. There I had the Best caiprihana that I've had since I visited Brazil, Wonderful mojitos, Fabulous Rioja and the greatest Cava ever! In fact, I am now going through Cava withdrawal.... Eclipse Bar: We visited the Eclipse bar one night and were a bit disappointed. As I said, Joey, the Lobby DJ was Wonderful and made us feel like dancing. So, we were a bit surprised that the DJ spinning at Eclipse was not nearly as good. Additionally, the bar had a lack of ventilation that gave the place a musty, sweaty smell. Additionally, at least 1/3 of the bar was blocked off for \"VIPs\", however, it was mostly empty while the rest of the bar was standing room only. We stayed about 15 minutes, then went back to the lobby to chill with Joey again. Tips: Book your tours early and remember that they do not run on Sundays. Ask the Concierge desk about a great wine store in the area and purchase your Cava, Rioja, etc. there. The prices to import Spanish wines to the U.S. are Extremely high!

We chose W Barcelona because we stayed in many W worldwide and had good experiences. Well, not with W Barcelona. Our trip was planned on a short notice, April 21 to April 24 2011. We have booked two rooms through a booking agency site and our flight was early in the morning. With the confirmation in our hands we have arrived early in the morning to the reception. We just wanted to leave our luggage there and heading to the city. When we wanted to check in we were told that the hotel was fully booked and that this supposed to be not their fault, but the fault of the agency. We have told the person on the reception, that we have a confirmation and we would like to have a room, or they should rebook us to an equal hotel. They said no and just left us standing there. We tried to talk to several persons, respectively asked for the responsible manager, but we were just left standing there. Next in line. Who cares whether you have a room or not, we are fully booked. We had a kid with us, so the whole situation was a bit difficult. We then called up our agency and they were already aware of the whole situation and trying to figure it out. Apparently W has not closed their booking system for agency although they were already fully booked. So who\u2019s fault was it now? After more than 30 minutes our agency called us saying W is not willing to help at all. Also, Barcelona seemed to be booked out at that day so we couldn\u2019t find any other hotel to stay. I then decided to call up American Express Centurion Card, as I am a member and owner of the card there. And suddenly (after almost 2 hours) something happened. I got introduced to a lady who took care of the whole situation. She asked us to come back in a few hours and she will see what she could do. When we arrived back in the hotel we had our rooms. We are still wondering how a fully booked hotel could (after a few hours) managed to have 2 rooms. We were very disappointed about the whole situation. A 5 star hotel, but no services at all. Staff just rude, until the responsible lady came. We are planning another trip to Barcelona\u2026.and we loved the view of the W Barcelona and the service of other Ws.

Yes, the ambience is young, fresh and hip. Is not that the brand? This was our 4th 5 star Starwood property during our trip, and is was a refreshing contrast to the usual \u201cluxury\u201d experience. Unlike what others have reported, our check-in was quick, greeted immediately, showed to our room with professionalism, and had a small glitch in the room corrected within minutes of our arrival. We stayed in a Mega room, which is a corner room, and had the additional of a tub with a slightly different layout and a partial port/city view. The difference between the Wonderful room and Fabulous room is the view, not the layout. Wonderful rooms are on one side of the hotel, odd numbered, and face the port, and Fabulous rooms are one the other side, even numbered and face the city/beach. I viewed several different room types, from Wonderful rooms to Marvelous Suite, and they were all great. The higher up, the better the view, but all views are mesmerizing. And the beds . . . . .ummmm, I am looking for that pillow top for my bed! Great rain shower but, ok, the smoky glass toilet situation is a bit \u201cintimate\u201d. We had two drinks in the Eclipse bar, enjoyed the view and 35 Euros later were back in our rooms. Yes to get to the bar, they monitor the elevator entrance, which I believe is more to monitor the # of patrons, than to exclude people, as the bar is small. The gym is one of the best I have seen in a hotel. We used the Concierge to buy tickets for an event, and to help us with our planning, with no problems. Yes, everything cost in this hotel, be prepared (but if you are thrifty, there is a grocery store right up the beach). Yes, the location is not in the middle of Barcelona, which is a good thing. It is actually a landmark seen from many locations throughout the city. But that is what makes it special. It is an oasis - that can easily be reached by taxi, or a 20 - 30 minute walk to central. Or the 17 Bus, right in front of the hotel, which is a 10-15 minute ride up Via Laietana, to City Central, (Placa Calaluya) continuing on up Passeig de Gracia, placing most major sites within (jump on and off ) walking distance. As a first time visitor, we used the bus to get everywhere, not the metro and saw all the major sites. It is also nice that the Bus originates in front of the Hotel, so you can get yourself \"situated\" on the bus without the concern of the notorious metro Barcelona pickpockets watching your moves. We also used the bus to take us to City Center to catch the airport bus, saving ourselves a few pennies. We checked out the Le Meridien, and the atmosphere was totally different, more the typical \"quiet and reserved\" feel. The W was buzzing with energy everywhere, is well noted, (when we arrived in the City, the Taxi driver said we were staying in the best hotel in the city) and is a beachfront escape - first time to Barcelona or last time to Barcelona, this is the right choice!

Its majestic appearance remind you more of a futuristic boat that is permanent docked. At the entr\u00e9es you will be greeted by futuristic FBI agents, the lobby and the interior is some of the most cutting edge I have ever seen in a hotel. Sleek, clean and open. But not sterile like a doctors office, warm and inviting, it feels like you have stepped in to the front page of Wallpaper magazine. This is what the W hotel is aiming for, a \u201cfuturistic safe haven\u201d in a busy and sometimes dangerous city. After sampling Barcelona you can sometime feel that you need a extra break just to come back to the real world. The late night dinning, nightclubs that never close, shop\u2019s that will leave you spent and more tourists and posers then most places. After you have sampled all of this the antidote is right in front of you, shining at the end of Barcelonetta Beach with it glass sail. Take the last couple of your days there, check in to a Wow room and let the staff and the chefs pamper you with some luxury, lets face it, we all need to get away every now and then and the W will let you hide away. I am not going to lie and say that it is a cheap hotel because it is not. But it doesn't cost more then the average hotel in any metropolitan city, if you compare what you get for your money the W Hotel delivers ten times what you would get from any other metropolitan hotel. I decided I needed some rest when I came there. My last nights in Barcelona. I feet that I had deserved something special. It felt more like sleeping on a luxury cruse liner then at a hotel. The bed rocked me in to a tranquil sleep. The view from my room at the 17th floor was probably the best view you can get anywhere in Barcelona unless you go up to Tibodabo and look down at the city. The sun was shining in my window all day, the sunsets where there to make romantic dinners in the room. The food was fantastic, I can recommend a burger, something simple, and the ham. For me aesthetics and interior counts for a lot, as a photographer there was a picture in every corner of the hotel and with the light, even the simplest of photos taken with a iPhone looks professional. So what is my conclusion: If you are going to Barcelona for a weekend I would definitely save up the money to stay at the W, it might not be the place to spend two weeks (unless you come from money) But if you are looking for a place for the last days of your holiday or a long weekend I can with my \u201chand on my heart\u201d say that you will have a challenge finding a better value for your money then the W Hotel.

I didn\u00b4t even see families or children (actually, I thought a little inappropriate for children. The hallways, for instance, is surrounded by glass). The staff was kind in every situation (when I asked for sheets, room service, transportation, check in, check out). The rooms were huge and with a great view, even you stay in lower levels. The beds were amazing. I didn\u00b4t like the bathroom, though. I don\u00b4t like this new way to project them, with no separation from the bedroom. Knowing that the hotel can be a little loud, I asked for rooms in a silent position. I could hear a little noise during the night, coming from the lounge (where there\u00b4s a dj and a bar), but nothing that kept me awake. There are two spaces to serve breakfast, one by the lobby, cheaper (25 euros) but not with many options. There is other, in the first level that costs 32 and it\u00b4s much more complete. If you don\u00b4t like to have breakfast in the hotel, you can always go somewhere else (there are Starbucks in every corner in Barcelona), but there aren\u00b4t many options around the hotel, since it\u00b4s a recent and new area (Barceloneta it\u00b4s the nearest place with restaurants, and it\u00b4s a 15min walk, by the beach). The business center it\u00b4s too small for a hotel this big and it\u00b4s always busy. But you can use the free wi-fi in the lobby (in the room it\u00b4s 5 euros/hour). I didn\u00b4t go the Eclipse disco, but I could see a lot of people going (young and also old), very nice dressed. But I don\u00b4t know, it seemed a very touristic and expensive nightclub. There\u00b4s a beach by the hotel, and a few meters away there\u00b4s a nudity point. It was nice to stay in this hotel and know why it\u00b4s so trendy, but I don\u00b4t know if I would stay there again...

Good quality Bliss amenities as well as a decently stocked mini bar and of course the fantastic bed and linens. The large walk in rain shower with moveable seating bench was also a great feature. The main issue with this hotel surrounded the staffing levels. In the evenings, it regularly took over 30 minutes of repeatedly calling to get anyone (Operator, front desk, Whatever Whenever, Room Service) to answer. Their excuse was that it was peak time for room service so everyone was busy. I have never experienced such a hassle in getting someone on the phone to place an order or make another request. However, once the order was received the food was delivered quick and was of high quality. There was also an issue with getting clean glassware in the room on a daily basis. They would always take away the dirty glasses but forgot to return with clean ones. The location was peaceful, a pleasant walk during the day to the metro (20 minutes) or Las Ramblas (30 minutes). Taxis also are always up front and are affordable to most parts of city. It might be worthwhile to carry a note-card or other indicator of the hotel location as more than one taxi driver in the City did not know the location of the hotel when we were trying to get home, and if you are not able to give directions it could be a problem.

Moreover, the crib was just empty, and the housekeeping did not provide us with the bed sheets for the crib. - the rooms doors are extremely difficult to open (esp when you are with the baby trolley) - no shoe polish in the room, no tea / coffee machine either - a day before our departure @ 10 pm we received a call from the reception desk, asking us to come down and place additional money to our deposit. The lady was very persistent, telling us that she was trying to reach us for 2 days (however we have not got any text message, nor telephone calls the day before, when we even did not leave the room). - the choice of the inroom dining menu is rather poor, not so many \"healthy\" items to order - one day we ordered a black tea and rice water to the room (my wife got poisoned), and they have charged 15 euros, which is too much to my mind for such kind of service, especially if a guest orders 1-2 times a day with an average bill of 70-100 euros. - a door in the lobby toilet (male) was broken, and could not be open from inside.

We had chosen a Spectacular Suite on the 21st floor and it was.. the outside terrace was perfect and we slept with the window open (70 degrees even in Novemeber). We never ventured outside the room on the first night and just enjoyed the view and the vast variety of food on the room service menu..the W chicken Salad is a must..acompained by dinky bottles of olive oil.

Expensive, quite a walk from the centre (although public transport and taxis right outside) and we were surprised that a 5 star GL hotel does not include a cooked breakfast in the price for bed and breakfast - only continental - if you wanted cooked, an additional 7 Euros per person. Some other guests complained that breakfast was breakfast in most hotels except the W. The prices were well over the top - the Spar supermarket - a five minute walk was the best place to get water - 4 Euros for 500 mls in the room - 0.90 cents for a litre of the same water in the shop. We would have spent money there had the prices been more reasonable but as it was we ate out. Could not fault the view or the room - strange having a bathroom in the room sitting in an opaque toilet cubicle - good shower, plenty of hot water - some towels were very ropey and ripped on use due to being past their sell by dates really - not what would be expected at a hotel of that standard. Would we go back? No - would want to be more in the centre of Barcelona with everything close by. Top tip: Use the tour buses (get two day card) before you go anywhere, book the Sagrada Familia before you go - this means no queueing if you really want to go in which you should it's amazing, buy a multi transport ticket for the remaining days of your stay for 10 journeys.

Not because this hotel is not beautiful, nor uncomfortable because it was both of these things and more, but for the little niggles which I'll come to in due course. But first I'll start with the pro's... It's brand new and gleaming. The whole design of the hotel is super modern with the artistic feel that Barcelona is famous for. I particularly like the 'whatever whenever' concierge, who advised on everything from lending European phone adapters, to recommending the trendiest restaurants in town, and they dealt with all the bookings gracefully no matter how much we chopped and changed our minds. The spa was gorgeous (typically 5* pricey) shame no indoor pool for the winter months, but we enjoyed the lap-style jacuzzi and steam / sauna rooms to hang out and relax in, and couldn't fault the treatments, with the cool new york 'bliss' products.. and they didn't try to 'hard-sell' me anything at the end. Just try the infamous 'bliss brownie'! There were a number of bars and restaurants dotted in and around the hotel; the wet-deck being closed as we were out of the summer season, but from the rest the food was consistently good. The breakfast was lovely; typical buffet style with options to choose from for more specific dishes. I particularly liked that it was open until 11.30am on the weekends, so we could lie-in (an 11am during the week). The in-room dining was very nice, and we were permitted to eat restaurant food in the bar area at 11.40pm which was perfectly chilled. There is a top floor bar called Eclipse which appeared to be the place to be in Barcelona on a Friday and Saturday night. Hotel patrons get to skip the queue which is a nice touch, and there are loads of cocktails to choose from. The panoramic view of beaches, mountains and marina was only blighted by the abundance of middle-aged groping couples who cluttered the low sofas around the circumference of the bar. Had I been slightly older or perhaps just drunker, I may not have found this offensive at all. The most important point I've not referenced so far is the rooms, and in terms of design, they're first rate. Shiny opaque glass and soft cream curtains spanning areas where neither curtains nor glass are required (often just adding texture to bland walls). The bathtubs were conveniently located right next to the bed. Who needs a bathroom anyway? And there was a handy switch for 'wow' lighting which knocked out any conventional spotlights and replaced them with coloured mood lighting oozing from various parts of the furniture. NOTE: the light switch arrangement was not idiot proof and it was much a case of trial and error rather than intending to turn on specific lights. Only four switches to choose from and some of them did different things when pressed at different angles, while others needed to be in the 'on' position for the bathroom light switches to become responsive. Although enormously time consuming, it would have been useful for a member of staff to have shown us how to navigate the super hi-tech system upon arrival. That brings me to staffing; we waited TWENTY minutes in a queue to be checked in, where the bolshy European urbanista's pushed past us 'unsuspecting and far too British' tourists. There was no queue structure and it took an inordinate amount of time to process each person. When I asked if our room had a sea-view like we'd booked, the check-in guy merely said it was spacious like that was a bonus. We'd booked a suite, that was a given. So, we booked a 'Sea Facing' Studio Suite which I must say was luxurious for a couple, with separate lounge / office area, and totally open bathroom (bath next to bed). Based on the internals alone, we would have been very happy with this. However, the outlook of our particular room - (Suite 228) directly overlooked the adjacent building site. Builders were less than 5 metres away from me - on the same level. Not much good to have a bath right next to the window then?! Given 90% of the hotel has been built in a iconic 25 storey tall glass nautical shaped tower, it seemed that we had been abandoned on the second floor in the leftover space between the impressive six storey high lobby and the fire exit, in a totally separate block to the rest of the rooms. While the space and layout were impressive, the view was not. NOTE: If you go for this room type then ensure it truly is a sea-view, if it is even available. The staff were not helpful on this point, and certainly not quick to move us, but after a great deal of shouting we were promised an upgrade to a Cool Corner Suite the following day. This was worth waiting for. There are only two corners to this hotel (given the rear where we originally were is just for the lifts) and both have spectacular views across the harbour and out to sea. Ask for Suite 818 or in fact any Cool Corner Suite ending in '18' as they run all the way up to the 24th floor on the left hand side of the building. Spectacular views. The Cool Corner Suites are large, with walk through bathroom, enclosed wetroom style showers, lounge area and of course the feature bath next to the bed, which personally I love; no good if you're holidaying with your grandma though. This room faced directly out to sea and onto the beaches from the lounge. Of the notable differences in this room to the Studio Suite were the electronic blinds (just the curtains were electronic in the Studio Suite), more flatscreen televisions, a bigger bathtub, and an iphone charger. There may well have been more subtle touches too that we didn't notice. The signature 'W' beds are sumptuous. A note on the small detail. The sink drain in our first room smelt of sewage (just need a good flush out I'm told) and the mood lights had a tendency to flicker. Some of the sink and indeed bath plugs didn't lift / drain when we pulled at the lever, and the edging on some of the mirrors had blobs of glue all over them. Not a deal breaker, but if you look for it, there are signs of a little rough round the edges that shouldn't be prevalent in a hotel of the W's stature. Plus we couldn't hear room service knocking on the door because it wasn't that close to the bedroom area of the suite. Perhaps door bells would be useful? The only other negative is the location. It's not on the main shopping strip like the Majestic, in the touristy Ramblas, or by the bars / restaurants on the front like the Art Hotel, but out on a secluded man-made strip by the commercial docks. This is NOT a problem as 90% of the hotel rooms turn their back on the commercial stuff and the rest is very attractive to look at. If, like us, you fully intend to get taxi's everywhere, or stay by the pool / beach / hotel / restaurants on site, then no problemo. If, however you strive to walk everywhere and make full use of the city's public transport network, then perhaps bring your walking boots or think again. My views only.

Really a 4+ star hotel with a couple of rough edges to keep it interesting. On the way to the hotel, you can see it forever and and while your anticipation builds at the sight of actually entering the glorious building, you may be forgiven for thinking you'll never get there. This hotel is off the beaten path across from the cruise ship dock and there is construction both along the circuitous route and adjacent to the hotel. You may also be forgiven the look of horror as you step out of the cab only to realize that a veritable sea of hot pavement separates your position at the curb from the actual entrance to the hotel. Maybe they could invest in some of those resort golf carts with the yellow and white striped canopies to ferry people to and from the curb - OK it's hyperbole, but it really is an unexpectedly wide promenade for such a high-end hotel! We arrived early in the afternoon, and there were no bellmen curbside to assist with the forementioned obstacle either. The single gentleman outside seems only to be there to direct taxis (and he has his hands full as this is a very busy hotel.) They really need a couple more full time bellmen hanging around *outside* and schlepping bags from the curb to reception. Once inside, we were greeted with a sea of people. There are 4 or 5 checkin stations, fully manned, but the lines move slowly. Once you get face to face with a human though, the experience is courteous and friendly. Our room wasn't available due to our early arrival so they took our cell number and offered to call us when the room was ready. Never did receive the call, but when I went back to inquire about the room, it was ready by their standard checkin time of 15:00. Arrival pains aside, once you're in the cocoon, this is a truly striking hotel. Visually impressive and full of helpful staff. Drinks are expectedly pricey, but not out of line with other hotels in this category. The views from the higher floors are worth the cost of admission, assuming you are on the left (north) side of the hotel facing the beach, not the harbor side. We had one of the Fabulous rooms on the 21st floor facing the beach/boardwalk and were impressed by both the size of the room and the view. Modern and clean with all the amenities you'd expect including an iPod player. The bath area (I hesitate to say \"bathroom\" because it wasn't a room) was a little funky, with the sink in the main room and the shower and toilet both in their own glass-enclosed roomettes with doors opening into the main room. Not complaining, it is a W after all, and style is what they do best. I personally found it fascinating, but others may be put off by it. The shower was spacious with good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Due to its location, there are not a lot of things to do adjacent to the hotel other than the beach, so we wandered down the boardwalk in search of dinner. There are some beachy and reasonably priced restaurants a 10 min walk up the boardwalk. While you're there, stake out a spot on the beach and enjoy the \"lounge chair\" service. No better place to relax with your beverage of choice. Also, the pool bar is a beautiful spot for enjoying the ocean breeze if not a dip. Checkout was unfortunately a mess. Long lines, long waits, slow computers. Reception is something they really need to address. Took me 10 min in line, 10 min checking out, and another 10 when I finally got the bill and realized they forgot to add the breakfast charge. The guy at the desk had a heck of a time getting the restaurant to answer the phone so he could update the bill! Really, this should have been handled automagically by the computer. Overall, the hotel was stunning as to be expected, and once inside lived up to my expectations for a hotel of this class. Dearth of bellmen and checkin/out aside, everything else was, as they say, Fabulous.

We then decided to have a look at the pool area and sea which was really nice and we decided to have coffee before we explore Barcelona. The receptionist was very kind and offered us a voucher for our coffees which was a nice touch.While we were seated we were approached by one of the hotel customer services staff called Jeremy. Jeremy welcomed us to the hotel and sat down with us and explained the best places to visit in Barcelona.We really had no plan and his advice was absolutely invaluable. We have the highest praise for Jeremy, he was professional and guided us on exactly what to visit and where, and how to travel around the city.

OTHER: We made a big mistake in ordering a car service (vs a cab) through the hotel staff to go to the cruise terminal (3 min ride) and payed $150 via the hotel vs a $15 cab ride. Felt that the concierge (20 something year old) could have helped us out by suggesting we take 2 cabs (had 4 big luggages, wouldn't fit in 1 cab) instead of getting gouged.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cCaring proffesional hotel\u201d", "Author": "Ellenbluebell", "ReviewID": "UR119165735", "Content": "Corprate Weekend stay in june for turned out for my huband and I rather upsetting, as I suffered a miscarriage.

As we walked into the hotel lobby we were approached by \"security\", who asked if he could help, when told we wanted to visit the bar, he just said come back at 7pm.The implication being leave the building until then. He did seem rather off hand and not terribly friendly. So we sat on the steps at the side for an hour, going back in at 7pm to be greeted with a queue of maybe 20 people in front. The queue steadily got longer, with a couple of families with young children also joining, we remarked to each other that we didn't think a cocktail bar was the place for children, but then in Spain who knows? After the families had been queueing for around 15mins they were approached and obviously told children were not allowed, Although we were glad we wern't going to have kids running around in the bar it did seem bad on the hotels part that no one informed these people earlier. I'm suprised thst the adults seemed to take their refusal so well! After waiting approx. 30 mins we were shown into the lift. A smoothe qiuick ride up, we just got there in time to photograph the sun setting over Montjuic. Suprisingly no one greets you as you alight from the lift. We found our way to the bar and grapped a seat against the window, we were handing a cocktail list soon after and our order was taken within a couple of minutes, we both had the \"Pink Floyd\".

Everything worked, mood lights and all. Fabulous showers and comfy bed so 5* there. Breakfast - went early in the morning so very quiet and I found it first class with fresh pastries, smoothies and juices. Excellent. Location - not great if you want to travel into town but it's what you pay for scenic location. Plenty of taxis so just a 10-15 minute cab ride. What is not so good ? Wi-Fi - terrible. Works OK in the lobby where it's actually free but pathetic in the room such that I had to stand outside the elevators where the antenna is for a signal. Staff (courteous throughout it should be said) told me it was indeed a problem. At least they did not charge me for it - frankly, for a hotel that wants to attract hip clientele to charge for wi-fi in 2011 is really a no-no. Wait - get ready to have your patience tested at check-in and check-out...far too many people and too few desks. Took over 10 mins to check out. Pool - OK pool, not huge, with comfy chairs all round. But who put it to the side so it's in the shade half the time ? Also, I am no fan of big impersonal hotel lobbies and W is no real exception...better at night with the lights on but overall a bit dull.

I enjoyed every minute of my time at this beautiful hotel. Rooms I had a \"Wonderful Room\" which truly was the very definition of the word \"Wonderful\". Walking in to the room, I was greeted by a beautiful view of the Mediterranean Ocean through windows that seemed to wrap around the entire room. The desk was ample and well-designed, the bed was a King-bed facing the windows and the energy efficiency of the room required that your card be inserted into a panel in the wall in order for the lights to work. The shower with its amazing rain showerhead was absolutely heavenly, as was the first-rate air-conditioning which you needed after a day in the Spanish heat. However, the BEST part of the entire room was the bed. Oh. My. Gosh. I can't even begin to describe in mere words how comfortable that bed was. I have never slept on a bed that just seemed to envelope your entire body and whisk you off to a fast and fulfilling sleep. Truly, one night I was there I think I crawled in to bed around 930/10pm just so I could sleep about 11 hours in that amazing amazing bed. Service From the concierge staff to the doormen to the endless number of W employees standing at the ready, this is a top-notch operation and they go above and beyond in order to cater to your every need. Food Food quality was good -- breakfasts were ample, the fruit was always fresh, the dinners were solid. No complaints here. Terrace Unbelievable. I enjoyed many a cocktail and cigarette on that terrace overlooking the Mediterranean, not to mention some very good food. Again, no complaints. Location Location is a bit of a downer -- it takes a solid 15 to 20 minutes to walk to a metro stop or, if you are so inclined, about 30-40 minutes to walk up to Las Ramblas. It's a bit too removed for those individuals who may want to be in the centre of things. That said, it's a gorgeous hotel and if you can afford to stay here, you shouldn't worry about taking the Metro or walking anywhere. Staying at the hotel is a wonderful experience. Hallways I highlight the hallways as an area of improvement. I stayed on one of the lower-level floors, but had occasion to see other hallways on other floors.

From the standpoint of the views from the room, the W does not disappoint. We were on the side away from the beach, with absolutely stunning views of the port and sea. Room was very comfortable, and surprisingly quiet. (There is an inner door in the room that helps to seal out the hotel noise, resulting in an exceptionally quiet sleeping area - not sure if the same would be true on the beach side.) So far, so good. If that were the only criterion, the W would get 5 stars hands down. Unfortunately, we like to eat, too, and that is where the property fell short for us. Our first night we visited Eclipse, the top-floor nightclub. We arrived relatively early (8:00 or 8:30 pm) and found the room sparsely populated, as we would expect for a city that comes alive after 11 pm. What we did not expect was that we would need earplugs. We were assured that the reason the room was so quiet (Not!) was that the DJ didn't start until 9 pm. The staff said the volume would go up significantly then. We left. If that were the only area where you had to risk hearing loss to eat and drink, we wouldn't mind. Hey, we were that age once, too, and enjoyed blasting our ears. But everywhere we went in the common areas, restaurants, bars, etc., it was the same thing. Relentless, pounding music. Add to that the fact that BraVo restaurant doesn't even open until 9 pm, and the beach-level restaurants (which I think simply lease space from the hotel, rather than being part of the W) were a bit on the rude side, and you could starve to death trying to eat there. We ended up walking to Port Vell (the old port a half mile away) for dinner. One final little annoyance - I am a Starwood elite member, while my wife is currently a non-elite Starwood member. When I told the front desk that we wanted to put her number on the reservation, so that she can get the points and hit gold status, they promptly took away the elite perks that I would have gotten.

W brands everything as fabulous, fantastic, or otherwise bombastic. The building itself can life up to this wording - the quality of service definitely not. This made me waste my time by writing this review. We stayed for 4 nights (starting 28 July 2011). Check-in was good. Well trained staff, wait time around 20 minutes, although there were only two other guests in front of us. That's not outstanding for $400 a night, but ok. We arrived at the room and wanted to turn on the music to unpack. Our reservation included an \"iPod dock\" for this (this is actually part of the room description!). We didn't see a dock during the whole stay. However after calling the front desk they sent someone up who then went away again to get a power plug (!!!) for the radio in the room as it wasn't even connected and a connection cable to plug the headphone connections of the iPod into the radio. No dock, no power for your device. So hopefully you didn't trust the room description and brought your own power plug. We did and so it was no big issue. On the second day somebody showed up at our room to give us our requested extra-keycard. Bad that we didn't request an extra keycard. And not very reassuring that anybody can simply request a keycard for our room. The excuse from the staff was, that someone must have written down the wrong room number for the request. We didn't give it another thought till the next day, when suddenly all our key cards didn't work any more. After the usual \"did you put it near your cell phone\" they issued us new cards - again no explanation why 4 keycards stopped working at the same time. The same \"professionalism\" was shown by the room service. On the second evening we had some small items as in room dining. According to the menu the W Burger should come with fries. In reality it didn't. So another call and after we finished eating we received the fries. No excuse, no comment, just fries. The next day we left our room at 9am to have a sightseeing trip through barcelona. When we came back in the late afternoon the room was still a mess, wet towels had not been changed, the mini bar hasn't been refilled during the whole time we were there up to this time. So we called again and requested the room to be cleaned and the mini-bar to be refilled. We left and came back in the evening to find everything in (almost) perfect order - mini-bar was refilled, used glasses were gone. However the empty plates and fork from the in-room-dining the day before were still there. And to make sure we don't take anything from the mini-bar again they also didn't replace the used glasses. So now we had a refilled mini-bar without glasses, used plates and forks (that stayed with us till the end of our stay). But - on the bright side - at least we had dry towels. At this point we just laughed - and went somewhere else to get some drinks. Somewhere where they even offered us a glas for our drink :) That the \"Show Bill\" option on the TV only displayed a cryptic error message was no big surprise after everything we experienced at the W. During our stay the whole management simply looked like it was the hobby of somebody - great idea, mediocre execution, no dedication to the basics. To cut it short: W Barcelona brands everything as outstanding, fabulous and so on. They don't mention that this is only true for the building, not for the delivered service quality. If you like good design, a nice view and lower your expectations on basic service quality, the hotel is good. Is it worth the price? I don't think so. There are a lot of design hotels out there that have the same pricing - and well trained staff. After all it's not rocket science we expected - just a clean room, dry towels and a regular refill for the mini-bar. We sent exactly this message to the W management before posting it here.

We were collected at the airport by the hotel car service, who provided an excellent, if pricey (E90) transfer, but with husband, children and tons of luggage was well worth it. The hotel upgraded us to a \"lovely\" room on the 26th floor which had a bath, wetroom and a seating/desk area. The kids went mad with the array of overloaded electronic devices in the room - think curtains, lighting, mood lighting, tv's, music! The rooms are modern, bright with a clever use of light and mirrors to create a feeling of space. The beds - well they are the best I have ever slept in. Truly amazing, almost like floating without being on a water bed! The Bliss freebies are very nice... The downstairs restaurant, Wave, I thought a tad disappointing, both for dinner and breakfast. The hot breakfast options were very limited, and travelling with a husband that loves a \"full english\" he found it limited. I had a Tortilla for breakfast which was dry and uninspiring. The service in the restaurant was also slow and haphazard. The outside pool area is clearly a place to hang out. White sofas, ambient music, beautiful staff...we had lunch there on our last stay and again, we were let down on the catering front, my husband's burger was inedible and looked like a frozen pattie from a bad day at McDonalds. Again, menu choice was very limited and could only get my children portions of fries as nothing else suitable was on offer. But the location, ambience and whole \"W\" ethic makes this property very special. The concierge remembered us from our first visit, even the kids names too and went out of his way to help us. We also appreciated the early check in at 9am with no fuss after being turfed off the boat at 8.30am. The beach in front of the hotel is pleasant, and the walkway connects to some great restaurants. There was nothing better than to watch the world go by from a beach bar under the shadow of the huge sail design of the W. The bar \"Eclipse\" on the top floor if well worth a visit for the views and sunset, and I guess can justify the drinks charges for the location. My husband particularly enjoyed going to the bathroom for the view! The hotel arranged at short notice (2 hours), a babysitter who was excellent and I then escaped for a visit to the Bliss! spa.

Service at the check-in and the front desk is superb - polite, helpful, and enthusiastic. As SPG Platinum I was \"triple upgraded\" to a large suite looking out directly over the Mediterranean.

The common areas are fun & sexy, like the huge poolside area that turns into a nightly pool party with live DJ and a fabulous crowd, and the enormous, first-rate gym (perhaps the best equipped hotel gym I've ever seen). And they have now developed the beach level exterior of the hotel to include several fun, quality bars and restaurants, so you have a large selection of venues without leaving the hotel.

There were lots of young people but also families with young kids. The room had a very modern and cool design. I had a chocolate cake deivered in the room for my birthday - we didn't order or say anything but it must have atomatically registered in their records when I checked in from the date of bitrh in my passport.

There are a couple of restaurants underneath the hotel. The city center is a cab ride away (about 10 min) and the airport was about 30-40 min away. The hotel has a night club (top floor) and a spa.

I have stayed at every brand that Starwood represents and my past experience with W hotels (Mexico City, Westwood California, New York, San Francisco, etc....)has not been very pleasant. The common theme I have felt in the past is the staff at the W's are very arrogant and portray a sense of power like they are better than the guest. I want to make it very clear that my stay at the W Barcelona has changed my view on the way I feel about the W brand hotels. My experience at the W Barcelona is top 2 maybe 1st on my list of best experiences which translates into best hotels I have ever stayed at. I am saying it tops most of the St. Regis hotels I have stayed in as well as Four Seasons. I am sure it helped being a Platinum member as I received an upgrade to a beautiful suite. My little sisters birthday being the main reason for my visit to Barcelona, I wanted our experience to be a memorable one. It started out as I walked in the door after a 15 hr flight, tired and grumpy and saw the line of people waiting to check in. Immediately glanced over and noticed a Platinum check in desk which Valentina immediately checked me in. My sister and I felt very welcome and comfortable from the second we arrived at the hotel. Valentina spent a lot of time going through the maps recommending great places to eat, sights to see and excellent clubs to go out at night. All your recommendations were magnificent! I especially loved the restaurant Cervecea Catelana.

Now, it\u2019s pretty nice, although the site for the W is at the far end of the beach, bordering the cruise ship harber.

We got upgraded and were staying in a suite, which was spacious and very, very nice: floor to ceiling windows, heavenly bed and a huge soaking tub. Luxury living at its finest. The service was also excellent. Just go to the concierge desk and they will attend to your every need from booking dinners, planning excursions or just directions around town. The food in the hotel was also quite good, but certainly pricey. Fortunately, our room plan included internet and breakfast\u2014and that was a tasty breakfast\u2014fresh pastry, salmon and all the Iberico ham I could eat. I miss that Iberico ham.

I went with my husband (we are mid 40's) for a short break. The hotel is in a great spot right on the beach and within easy walking distance of restaurants, cafes etc. The rooms are lovely with good views - yes the beds are comfy. I usually find breakfast in hotels to be arduous with long waits for coffee, tea etc and this proved no different with a huge price tag! We had breakfast included but had we not we would have taken a 5 min stroll down the beach and had a simple breakfast at a beach cafe. The pool area is split level. The bottom level has the bar with sun beds and cabanas around it. The area was really really busy, but nicely so with music playing and a great bar. The first level obviously did not have the pool but it was less than 30 seconds away and I guess because we are a bit older we found the area upstairs to be much more tranquil and really was very very lovely. You could pop downstairs to the bar anytime for a drink or have drinks/lunch brought to you. We found the pool/bar staff to be extremely helpful, they really did seem to go out of there way to make everyone comfortable and happy and they should be rewarded - it is hard work in very hot sun. One tip! It was the norm for the sunbeds to be reserved with towels, books etc and although I was uncomfortable with this we were assured by the staff this was the norm so do this - but go early! Even by 9.30 am all the beds down by the pool were reserved and even the best spots upstairs. Of course the usual situation happens when people don't actually turn up until midday. I think this made things difficult for the staff but they really handled it well and always found somewhere for people to sit. In the evening the bar around the pool transforms itself to an evening bar and its really great to sit around, have a cocktail and be by the sea. The hotel has an area on the beach also. The hotel definitely errs on the young side but there are people of all ages and we would stay here again because it is very hard to find a hotel on the beach in a city like this. We will be back to Barcelona and the only other hotel I would look at is The Arts which is at the other end of the bay. One last thing! They are building a hospital right next door to the hotel and before we went we saw pictures from other travellers.

This time, I went with my wife and spent 3 nights. We celebrated a special occasion and wanted to be near the beach. I have stayed in many 5 star resorts in Europe, Asia, USA, and the South Pacific so I think I can objectively judge the overall experience. The check-in experience was cold and impersonal when we arrived with an employee who was not particularly polite and flexible, in spite the fact that he knew I was celebrating a special occasion with my wife. We had to wait for a couple of hours until our room was ready. However, my further liaison with the W reception staff with Pasquale and Romina in the front desk was good and they were particularly understanding, efficient and polite. Just some useful general comments in note form: 1. The W is not located near town. It is a good 10 to 15 min walk from Barceloneta and a 25 minute walk from the Ramblas. Taxis are fairly cheap however and can save you time. 2. The hotel is much more impressive at night. Some of the infrastructure is run down and this is exposed in day light. For example chipped off corners in the corridors, are very common, paint that has faded away in many parts etc. The corridors and elevators are particularly dark during the night to create an ambiance and hide certain flaws I guess\u2026 3. Impressive views from the higher floors (15 to 25) from both sides. The north facing side that overlooks the beach has a slightly more interesting view at night, but I would not pay the premium of around Euro 50 plus, on top of the 300 per day we paid. We stayed on the 20th floor and all the high floors from any side are amazing. 4. I do not think this hotel is appropriate for families with small children, primarily because of the large number of couples (straight and gay) and their behavior in the pool and the adjacent bar area (I am not conservative but the staff was reluctant to enforce any decency code of conduct in public areas). In addition, the beach features a lot of nudists 50 plus men\u2026Not my cup of tea\u2026 5. Breakfast (if not included in the price) is at 29 Euro per person +VAT and is definitely not worth the money. I believe the selection is very poor for a 5 star hotel of this reputation. I have stayed at Starwood hotels in Greece, Asia and the South Pacific and the breakfast was simply amazing. Not at the W Barcelona. 6. The rooms are overall very nice with lots of amenities and of course excellent views. Our room had a blocked basin when we arrived, and was missing a light bulb from the light near the window. The shower had a few issues with the flow. The basin was immediately fixed after I reported it to the reception. Amenities are above average, with Bliss products, nice plush bath robes, a Tivoli sound system with an ipod docking station The radio didn\u2019t work but connected our mobile phones and solved the music issue\u2026 7. The mineral water in the room costs 4 Euros. I think this is a rip off 8. The pool bar cocktails are excellent and all the sun beds and seats are very comfortable. 9. The pool\u2019s size is a joke for the size of the hotel and always far too crowded on a nice day. The beach is quite decent, clean and the staff very friendly and helpful. The water quality is far from the Aegean sea, but quite nice for Spanish beach standards with very nice sand that has been artificially brought in. It can get quite wavy in East or South east wind conditions. Verdict: An overall decent experience, yet rather overpriced for what it offers. Many alternative options for a ~ 300 Euro per night accommodation budget, that does not including breakfast.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chippenham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIf only this hotel was as good as the weather ........\u201d", "Author": "374jane", "ReviewID": "UR117016585", "Content": "Having stayed in some wonderful hotels around the world in the Starwood group I assumed that the W Barcelona would fulfil all the promises made on the website.

Together with the beach location the main reasons for us to choose this hotel for a 5 night stay. It was clear upon arrival that we did not 'belong'. So we asked for a great room to compensate for our mistake. Ans we got it. We booked a wonderful room. All wonderful rooms look out over sea/harbour and all fabulous rooms look out over sea/beach/Barcelona. Barcelona is a vibrant city. The view over the quit sea watching ferries and cruiseliners sail by was really calming. So I preferred the wonderful part of the hotel. But not all rooms are that wonderful. Avoid rooms floor 1-5 (disappointing view). Do not accept a room with a view on the building construction of the new Desigual HQ (bad view, lot of noise all day already at the pool). Floors 6-15 are fine. Floors 16-21 are perfect. Floors 22-25 look perfect, but you can hear the beat of the music at the Eclipse bar till late in the night. Our room on floor 23 was spacious with 40 square metres. The bed is soft and was one of the best we ever had in any hotel. No bath but a great shower. Less impressive is the glass walled toilet. It's just indiscrete. Roomservice, laundry and minibar are over expensive. It is a shame there is not even a complementary bottle of water. No turndown service either. So I asked reception. She asked: 'what is a turndown service?' Get a course in hotel business dear! New towels and some amenities came right away. So that is ok. And the Bliss products are just great. Our shower was broken. It was repaired immediatly. Staff even called to ask if we were satisfied. Having a full iron board in the room is pleasant. Getting a bed on the pooldeck or sundeck is not easy. There are not always enough beds. Unacceptable for such an expensive hotel. The pool furniture is the same as at the hotel Urban in Madrid. Comfortable but quality a bit poor. So some beds were already broken, just like at the Urban. Generally the staff is very helpfull. But watch out for some staff members at the pool with a big attitude. Two did not want to help us at all. Only when a bunch of perfect people with money entered the scene, they were happy to arrange beds right away. I was really happy to see guys like Jos\u00e9. He seemed to work twice as hard as most. The staff should follow a more active bed policy (allow only one bed per person and accept no claims by people leaving for hours for breakfast or lunch). What would certainly help is refusing non-residents to use the beds. A lot of 'friends from the city' came over for a visit to the pool and the beach. Having a party. It's easy to access the facilities without a key (doors are kept open, key is not required to use the elevators). Sometimes an unpleasant smell of food covers the pool deck. Construction failure? Swimming is impossible. The pool is small for this size of hotel. But not too small for Barcelona standards. Problem is that there is no kids pool. So the little ones make it their territory. If you don't have two pair of sunglasses and four pair of swimshorts, you might feel a bit out of place. For you, there is the beach. It's public, but well controlled and secured by the hotel. And you will immediatly see some nice beach restaurants right under the hotel serving great food at reasonable prices. The corridor to the Bliss Spa is impressive. Only there is a crossing from storage/kitchen to restaurant. Several times this crossing was covered with spilled food. When it is clean, you can see the intensive use of the carpet at this crossing. Not the thing you want to see if you enter or leave the spa. Security was watching the property intensively. An incident with a small local anarchy group was solved cool, professional and immediatly. Still you do not feel the presence of security. That is the way it should be. One day we had a problem with the elevator. The door showed unpredictable behavior, the elevator did not move anymore. We decided to use the SOS phone which you will find on each floor. No response, dead line. After reporting this, they took it extremely serious. Some stupid guest used the fire alarm in the hotel lobby one night. I can tell: it works, also in your room. Wifi is for free at the lobby (hotel service), but also on parts of the beach (Barcelona service). We liked the Anyway Anywhere service at the lobby. We liked the Dutch lady serving us even more. Eager to help, eager to give you a great experience. Sharing many options. Big smile. Some might find the location a bit out of centre. But it is right on the beach, it does attract all kinds of new activities and three bus lines make it right to the hotel. Line 17 brings you in 15-20 minutes to the Gracia (luxury shopping / 3 subway lines / tranfer to bus 24 for Parc G\u00fcell). And it even is not too far to walk to the nearest cheap breakfast place, pharmacy, supermarket and ATM. A lot of remarks can be made. I can go on a few more pages. But in essence, this place is a very well run 24 hour night club for a certain type of people. We now knoe for sure, we are Westin people. So we will not return to the W.

Check-in / check-out was quick and efficient, we had in room breakfast (excellent), staff at the bar is nice, all the young guys in the lobby were really helpful. The only negative point is that despite the hotel is almost new, some equipments / furniture show their age. Carpets are stained and lights were not working properly. It's a shame and it can ruin the overall impression. Maintenance is a real challenge for this hotel. W is trendy / hype, it's a solid 4-star, but it's not a luxury property, probably because service cannot be personalised when there are 473 rooms & suites.

At the reception was the same guy that checked us in who bearing the time offered us coffee and water.... that was the first nice thing since we arrived!

If we're staying in a city with a W Hotel, you bet we'll be checking in at one. I am SO tired of hearing W Hotels get bad reviews because it was \"too clubby\", \"too loud\" or \"it wasn't kid friendly\". W Hotels are mostly geared towards the internet generation, or people young at heart who appreciate a lively environment (this includes grand opening parties and busy lounges). Yes, you pay a little more than, say, a Motel 6 and you're not always going to get a really \"cultural experience\" at a W, but they are what they are: modern and hip - and I hope this never changes. You're at W Bali and realize you'd prefer to be surrounded by trees and have an open concept suite with no walls? That's great - so a W Hotel simply is not for you. But please....don't rate it 1 out of 5 for that reason. Also not a very kid friendly chain...so book accordingly : ) About W Barcelona: We were there for 5 nights. Stayed in a Cool Corner Suite on the 7th floor. I arrived very early at 7 am and my partner arrived in the afternoon. As our room wasn't ready yet, I was allowed to check my big luggage at the front desk and was shown to the change-rooms on the gym level so that I could shower and change after my long flight, which was great. Our room was ready by 10 am, also a plus. Breakfast food was great, buffet style with a small menu selection, but you won't need to order off of the menu as there is so much to choose from in the buffet. Eclipse bar on the 26th floor has great views and delish little snacks, as does the W Bar Living Room on the main floor. We were at W Barcelona for the Wet Deck Grand Opening Party, which was, yes, very loud...but we were fine with it as we were there enjoying the view, live DJ and dancing until late. The hotel is about a 15-20 minute walk into the main part of town, but it is beautiful, as it's along the beach on a boardwalk. If you're not up for it, grab a taxi for $5. The only thing that wasn't amazing was our service at dinner...our server was inattentive, but we felt bad for him, as he had too many tables. One more thing: We love kids...but not when we are on vacation. So what was nice about W Barcelona is that there weren't many kids at all.

The sleeping room is seperated from the the toilet with a glassdoor, so you NEED to be close to one youre sharing your room with. Its not possible to go to the loo without being \"noticed\". You hear everything. I shared my room with my bestfriend, and we just played loud music to solve this. Worked OK. That being said - the bathroom was very nice and clean, so nothing there to complain about. Big and luxurious shower. - They play very loud music specially in the weekends at night. We stayed from sunday to tuesday, and could hear music from the pool in our rooms at 2 oclock on the sunday. They also play music early in the morning. Didnt bother me that much, but noticed it, and thought it was a bit weird that the hotel (where people come to sleep...) play music that late. - The breakfast is expensive compared to what you get in Barceloneta (5 min. walk). It doesnt include hot meals, just cold. They did not have vegetables, such as cucumber and salad etc, and not things you would expect from a 5star hotel. They had smoothies and fresh fruit though. Around 20 euro I think. - One last thing: Book this hotel through sites such as hotels.com - its much cheaper than calling them directly. We paid 410 for one night in the cheapest room, but would have gotten it for about 310 if we had used hotels.com If you can afford it, I strongly recommend it.

Concierge recommendations for bars, restaurants were spot on for us. Breakfast was good but the restaurant was always very crowded and noisy - there was an IT-related conference on at the hotel when we were there so lots of business men, probably more than usual - all with the usual IT professional looks (pens in pockets, short sleeve shirts and those name tags around their necks all the time)!

I had encountered a minor problem during the booking procedure, and was well reassured by Montse Ontiveros (reservations manager), that all our concerns would be taken care of. We hadn't even arrived, and already they were taking care of us! Our check in was late, (due to the air traffic controllers strike-we were lucky to arrive at all!!), but managed swiftly when we arrived. Our room was on the 22nd floor, and once we opened the door, it didn't take long to realise what a sublime view of the coastline and the city we had. Lucky us! We didn't waste much time before we went to the W (main) bar on the ground floor, where we were well taken care of.The cocktails recommended by the very friendly and professional bar staff were fabulous. Our wake up the next morning was to a rather enviable view, although I imagine with ceiling to floor windows most views are pretty spectacular.We treated ourselves to a room service breakfast- when the sweet sleeper beds are this comfy, why would anyone be daft enough to get up 20 minutes earlier. Christian (if memory serves me correctly), was the waitperson who promptly delivered breakfast, and was so pleasant, informative and totally charming, we almost invited him to stay for breakfast! The food was amazing and we loved the selection of pastries and fruits-there is plenty to suit everyone's taste. Sadly we had to leave the hotel to do some obligatory sightseeing (this was not my idea!), I would have been happily amused for the entire duration of our stay, to lounge about the hotel in one area or another. Later in the evening we took a trip to the Eclipse bar, recommended by just about everyone, and yes, it is as fabulous as it has been described..the sax player was brilliant and entertained the uber trendy crowd for the duration. During our stay,our only disappointment was that we had to leave at all! I know some of the friends were hoping we would be stranded in Barcelona because of the strikes by the air traffic controllers, but sadly, it was not to be. There are not enough superlatives to describe the true fabulousness of the W hotel and it's service and staff.

As a young, stylish couple the hotel seemed catered to us. Pros: - Room: The room was beautiful. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The view was amazing. Motorized blackout curtains. Need I say more? -Ambiance & Location: Outdoor beds, cabanas and lounge chairs (both at beach and pool area) free to guests. Absolutely incredible location right on the beach. Very liberal culture-- expect 50% of the women to be topless while tanning. Don't miss dining at the Bravo restaurant (quite expensive but worth it-- make sure to try the world's best Jamon Iberico de Bellota). Cons: -Room: After spending a night at the hotel some (metaphorical) cracks began to show in it's perfection. It became apparent that the designers and furnishers valued form over function. Some examples include the weak water pressure in the shower, the glass walls separating the shower and toilet from the rest of the room (forget privacy), most of the lamps didn't seem to serve any function other than to throw some dim colors onto the wall. This theme of form over function carried into the hallway, which was poorly lit and dank. At the end of the hallway there was a large glass door that opened out onto a metal stairway with a beautiful view of the sea-- but it was designated as an emergency exit only and was linked to an alarm. -Ambiance and Location: More families with young children and older couples than I expected, given the nature of the hotel. I imagine all the music and lights must have given them a headache. It is a 3-4 km walk to La Rambla, which is the main drag through Barcelona. If you don't want to spend half an hour walking into town, your only options are expensive cabs or city busses (which are quite nice). The Eclipse club/bar at the top of the hotel is rather small, didn't have much comfortable seating and smelled a bit like vomit during our stay. Service: The service was decent overall, and I suppose on the whole a little more friendly and attentive than what you'd expect in Spain, but that's not saying much... Below my personal standards. Continuing the overall theme of form over function the hotel seems to employ models whose sole purpose is to open certain doors-- but usually are too busy chatting with their friends to be bothered to do so. Almost everything (including the internet) comes at a price, and expect a load of laundry to cost almost as much as your room itself. This being said, I have very high standards and did enjoy my stay overall.

Reception told us that they could not remove the charge , as it had been added by the concirege and that we had to go through them. We spoke to the concirege who initially insisted that the charge was ours. She told us that it was a pickup at the airport for a flight from JFK on Delta. We did not arrive on Delta and did not fly through JFK, and offered to show her our eticket itinerary.. Instead of just deleting the charge the concierge spent the next 35 minutes trying to find the email to justify the charge or figure out why the limo was sent or who it was properly chargeable to.

My cousin came a few days before a stayed at hotel 1898 in Playa Catalunya and it's nice, great shopping, but I have to say, the W Barcelona blows it away (at least if you're a hip jet set crowd). I'll tell you the positives and the negatives. The positives, well it's an amazing looking hotel on the beach with the view of the ocean. You will see lots of beautiful people walking around. It seemed like you were in some high end lounge with guests that stayed there. But there were families also. The pool and the bar was amazing. The pool area and the pool itself could have been bigger as the hotel is massive and they could have made it a bit bigger, however you walk outside and you have the ocean so they probably build it that size based on that. The room itself is beautiful. Nicely kept amenities, the shower, the toilet and toiletries. The bar at night is really happening and they have a DJ in the evenings playing some good tunes. There is a club on the 26th floor, which is overcrowded but is fun to see the ocean and the city from high up, but I still preferred the pool. The downside, well the staff was overall very attentive and great, however I wish the food was the same caliber (which I felt about other restaurants there also like Opium and the place next door). Checking in and checking out was painful... it took forever! We were running late to the airport and the lines were really long on Sunday when we wanted to check out. The one lamp in our room didn't work and the ipod dock for the iphone didn't work directly, you had to pull the wire out and plug it directly into the iphone to make it work (minor things that could happen in any hotel, but thought I'd mention it). You also have to take taxi's to get to downtown area and the shopping. Overall however, it was a fantastic stay. I miss it everyday since I left!

We arrived at 11 pm on a Sunday night of a holiday weekend in Barcelona and the noise in the lobby as we checked in was intense. There was loud clubbing music and a huge queue for the lift to the 24th floor nightclub. But, notwithstanding the initial sense of noise and chaos we weer checked into our room in minutes and the room was well soundproofed. In any event, the noise level tapered off by the time we finished dinner at about 12.30 am. And next day, in the sunshine, we really began to appreciate the hotel. I was apprehensive about staying in a property with more than 400 rooms, but the hotel is more than capable of handling the numbers. The restaurant at breakfast was never overcrowded; the pool area (which is gorgeous) always had plenty of beds available and there are aslo beds on the adjoining beach; and best of all, there were always plenty of very helpful staff at hand to cater for anthing you might need. The only dissappointing features were the room - we had a so-called \"fabulous room\" which had a great view but was otherwise very run of the mill - and the other drawback was the lack of enough maids to service the rooms. On one of the days we were there, we had to call reception at 4.30 pm to complain that the room had not been serviced. And for the three nights we were there, there was no sign of an evening turn down service which was surprising in a 5 star GL property. But these quibbles did not spoil what was in every other way a wonderful 3 days in this hotel. It is the perfect place to stay in summer - right by the beach and with one of the nicest hotel pools I have ever seen where you are expertly looked after by the large pool/bar staff. The pool area turns into a very elegant outdoor bar in the evening which is ideal for pre and post dinner drinks.

I'm very happy that we did. The hotel is a stunning modern building on the very edge of the beach. It looks like a giant silver sail coming out of the ocean. Our room was one of the basic W rooms, but the view was breathtaking, and they set it up in such a way that your floor to ceiling windows are the focal point.

I almost laughed out loud when I used the washroom in the bar to realize that its urinals are set up in such a way as to give you an unobstructed view of the ocean while you are doing your business! I think the W chain is known for its level of service. This was confirmed to me in a number of ways - the concierge making us a dinner reservation upon our arrival at a fish restaurant in town; one of the porters getting us a taxi and providing directions to the driver in Catalan so that we wouldn't get lost with the language barrier; pool staff being around and ready to bring us anything we might need in an instant; being able to hop the line to the bar as a paying guest; etc. The service definitely lived up to its reputation.

That's the first thing you say when you get to stay at the W. Design, design, design. And views. That's what really makes this hotel stand out of the crowd. Especially, when you think of the standard, big city, kind of hotel: the W is nowhere like it. The glass-and-steel, enormous modern lobby already sets you at what to expect. The rooms are fantastic: modern design, inventive lighting, fresh ideas: I just loved the bathroom in the living room concept (there is no separate bath room!). And the views? The whole wall of the room is a glass pane with a sea view of the Mediterranean: how cool is that? With a comfy couch right close to that huge window which just seems to say: sit down, take a drink, slow down and relax looking out the window. I could go on and on, but you really need to experience this to understand what I mean. Just believe me: if you like design you will like it. There is no rose without thorns, unfortunately. The service is definitely not on par with the beauty of the building. Though the beginning was promising (I got a personal call right when entering the room, with somebody asking me if they can assist me in any way, nice touch), later got quite some problems in terms of service in the restaurant and bar: waited ages for fried eggs, couldn\u2019t get a decent espresso, waited 25 minutes (with watch in hand!) for somebody to take my order at the pool... ugh. Since I was on a business trip I needed the internet: It was distressingly slow and damn expensive (come on, with these hotel prices, surely the hotel can afford to throw in free wi-fi?).

Pool: UNREAL. Plenty of loungers and the hotel was full. Unbelievable view of the ocean from the pool, great service, great drinks. The day after we arrived, they turned the whole pool area into a living room type feel- and threw a huge, FREE party for all the guests- including tasty, top shelf drinks! We couldnt believe it. Room: As others have stated, there is zero privacy in the bathroom- this isnt a huge issue, though. We just developed a system of saying \"Dont you have to go get a cup of coffee??\" , the other person would leave for 10 minutes, and that solved that. Rooms are typical W style- modern, amazing beds, and THE VIEW- pure magic. Staff: \"Whatever, Whenever. What is your wish?\". Need I say more???? Food: Great.

The hotel is right on the beach and has an amazing Spa. The full body massages are heavenly. The location of the hotel is perfect if you plan on staying at the beach. It is away from the city centre and too far to walk to any tourist attractions but there is a touristic bus nearby about a 15 min walk that will take you to all the must-see spots located in the city. The best part of this hotel is the breathtaking views. We had asked for a room on a high floor and were placed on the 18th floor with city and sea views. I woke up every morning to this beautiful scene from my bed pillow. The beds were heavenly and so comfy. Beware, if you stay here, room with someone you know very well. Bathroom and shower are enclosed in see-thru glass and have no privacy whatsoever and just a curtain separates the bed from bathroom. Good thing this didn't bother me as you can see (and hear) everything. You may want to ask for a room on a high floor unless you don't mind listening to the music which plays on the deck during weekends, if you are on a lower floor. Everyone was great and made us feel so welcomed. We had asked for a coffeemaker in our room and the staff made sure it was waiting for us in our room and even brought us freshly ground coffee. The breakfast buffet was delicious! The beach was wonderful and so relaxing. If you plan on strolling along the beach, you will see joggers, bikers, skaters, people walking their dog and so much more including a few people sunbathing in the nude, but everything was all in good fun. :) The entire staff at this hotel were great and everyone spoke excellent English & Spanish. I loved our wake-up calls every morning and hearing the voice on the other end apologize for taking me away from my dreams. One staffer in particular went above and beyond in making us feel so welcomed. I plan on writing a thank you letter to him soon.

We instead checked out bags into storage and walked around the hotel. The hotel is right on the beach and a nice walk along the pier. My husband and I traveled with our 2.5 year old son so the proximity to the beach was wonderful for my son. He loved playing in the sand. It looks like they clean the beach frequently so it was very clean and well maintained. They did have some construction going on at the outside of the hotel (pier area). Looks like some new stores are going in? There was a nice red climbing rope structure that was fun for kids too a short walk along the beach. We also loved that you can rent a bike, rollerblade and people watch. Even late at night, it seems safe with lots of couples and families walking around. We were out 11/12 pm with no issue. The hotel was wonderful and the studio suite was really great! We had a nice partial view of the ocean from the 6th floor and was able to see the people biking and rollerblading. Woke up to a wonderful view of sail boats and cruise ships. There weren't many picture of the studio suite but it was really nice. We had 1.5 bathrooms. and a curtain that separates the living and bedroom spaces. Great with the little one as we could hang out in the living room area while he slept inside. The bathroom was also wonderful. The rain shower, tub, and full sized bliss shower gels/shampoos were great! The suite also included free bottled water so that was a nice touch. We did try dinner at the Wave restaurant downstairs, it was just OK for me. Food was fine and pricing not cheap but since we didn't find a lot of dining options, we tried it out. T I walked by the gym and there was lots of nice equipment but can't say I used it. I instead took a walk by the beach instead! One thing to note about the beach, some parts of the beach have nude sunbathers. It didn't bother us too much and my son didn't really notice so it was fine with us. There are a few buses that can bring you into Port Vell area. I remember one is 17 but cannot remember the others. The nearest train station is about 15 minutes away so not a bad walk along either beach but not close either. Taxi ride from the airport was bout 29/30 Euros for us. Overall, it was a really good stay we had with a wonderful room and relaxing time by the beach. Very good for families in my opinion due to the proximity to the beach. We really enjoyed the part as it was more resort like. We spent the next part of our vacation after the cruise in the Le' Meridian. The room was not as nice, and atmosphere is not as relaxing but you were at the center of everything! You can walk to many places. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again!

We were also there over Easter, and were told by three different concierges, three different sets of times for Easter masses at Santa Maria Del Mar. We lucked out with the last one, who actually attended church there. We did, however, get excellent recommendations for local dinner accomadations. Just be prepared to do a little research on your own instead of relying 100% on the concierge staff. The lobby bar area was a fun place to socialize with other travelers, as the furniture was placed to create interaction between different groups. The sky bar had a wonderful view of the city, but not as much interactive furniture placing. The appetizers in both bars were excellent. We actually visited the lobby bar three times during our stay. Just be prepared for the continually thumping of the bass from the music. It goes all day long and into the night. If you're looking for a quite time on the beach, this hotel isn't for you. But, if you're looking to socialize with other travelers in a fun atmosphere that is higher end than a local bar or stuffy hotel, this is the spot.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kiev, Ukraine", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel - unprofessional service\u201d", "Author": "HONkiev", "ReviewID": "UR107129031", "Content": "Yes, this Hotel is stunning!

The staff seems satisfied with their work and therefore service is not only quicker and smoother but also much friendlier! The suite was a heaven and spotless. Daily cleaning was impeccable. Bathroom amenities replenished regularly. Quick service at the pool area. Staff plus supervisors circulating and are being attentive all the time. Check-in/check-out procedures improved. Eclipse bar on the top floor is a very popular place (serving excellent cocktails) and will get crowded early.

Be adventurous and sip the house specialties prepared by experienced mixologists. I had Sea Breeze (I think) and it was good. Breakfast was good with adequate spread. I had continental and it got me through late lunch. Had dinner at wave for a couple of nights and both were good. Gym is spacious! Probably one of the biggest hotel gyms I've ever been to, and with good workout range. Spa was full when we made enquiry, but I had some treatments at Bliss before so I'm sure it's great. We made a stop at Eclipse, where hotel guest will get priority. The view was stunning but! that night we smelled vomit so we're out of there in five minutes. Location Some people said that the location's a bit far from all the actions. True, but for us, the morning stroll by the beach from the hotel to near by La Barcelonetta (rows of seafood restaurant, a bit of tourist trap) and the marina was enjoyable. Suggestions Had a table reserved at Principal for NYE dinner and we had the worst (and the most expensive) dinner ever. The fish were raw and the service was poor. We were baffled by how the nonchalant response about the incident. Restaurant Barceloneta - Over priced and overrated. The restaurants down the street probably will get you better seafood with much less money. Catalana - The best! The best tapas we had in Spain (and we went to many).

I am a big fan of design and music, but I dont think this compensate the lack of service in today\u00b4s trendy hotels. The W barcelona has finally managed to get the best of both worlds. I couldn\u00b4t find a single thing to complain about, staff is friendly, attentive, smart, handsome and efficient, the food got s much better, the skybar its probably the best club in barcelona. Whatever you are doing, please keep on doing it! All 5 star hotels in barcelona should learn from this guys.

A lot of dust!! 2 lamps not working in the room, such a shame especially for the coloured lighting (philips i think) Not one complimentary bottle of water! you don't expect to pay 4 Euro for a bottle of water - it's simple and easy offering at least tea and coffee making facilities - in that case you are willing to spend 100 Euros or more at the restaurant or bar\u2026otherwise you only want to eat outside!

After I booked this hotel I went on tripadvisor and as most people would got drawn towards the worst reviews, so I was a little apprehensive. But I can tell you my daughter (20) and I had a wonderful time. The staff were so kind and very attentive, check in went very smoothly we had one person in front of us and a member of staff (a very attractive man and that really goes for all of staff) came and apologised for any delay (2 minutes to be exact) and took our bags. The receptionist was very friendly found our room, checked we had breakfast included. We then were taken to out room on the 12th floor which had a fabulous view and I thought was comfortable with a stylish design. This hotel is for people who appreciate interior design and as this is my job suited me right down to the ground. All fixtures and fitting are done with thought and impeccable taste. We went to the ground floor bar on a few occasions we were served immediately, their cocktails seem expensive at 12 euros each but at most restaurants we went to they were at least 8 Euros but the W cocktails are made from fresh ingredients and served with a lovely big bowl of nuts and they really didn't skimp on the alcohol, they were delicious. The breakfast was marvellous so if you can get a deal with it included its certainly worth it, it has a great selection of fruits, breads, cereals, cakes, ham, cheese, even meatballs and if that doesn't please you they will make you any type of eggs you want. The staff again a very handsome bunch were never far away with coffee and juice everything seemed to be of the highest quality. I love travelling and have been to many good hotels and I felt this was one I'd definitely revisit if I had the chance. Maybe its because I go with a good attitude and with a fun sense of humour people alway seem to react in a generous and positive way to me.

First impressions of the hotel and room were high, the layout and style is ultra trendy, bed was very comfortable, although the lighting was tricky to work out. The bathroom arrangement didn't bother me as I was on my own but I can see it might bother couples who didn't know each other that well. The main issue I had was that the whole room had a strange vibration/humming which was especially noticeable when I was trying to get to sleep. Initially I thought this was a fan from the bathroom because I'd left a light on, however it wasn't this, then I thought it was the AirCon, nope. Eventually I removed the key card from the slot by the door but it still wouldn't stop. I finally tracked it down to the wall by the bed which was vibrating and humming (but not constantly, it kept slowing down, stopping and then starting again). It felt like it was some big extractor fan or something connected with the lifts or air con deep inside the hotel! I reported it to reception the next day, but nothing was done. As I was busy working doing 16 hour shifts I didn't spend much time in the room, except when I was trying to sleep. Luckily I was exhausted and dropped off quickly each night, if I'd been paying for the room myself I would have been asked to be moved. On the last day before I left my flight was cancelled so I checked back in for an additional night. I made sure I was put in a different room on a higher floor, however when I walked in I could tell that a previous guest had been smoking in there and I had to return to reception for another room. This was great, higher up and with a fantastic view. A few other pointers. Service was a bit hit and miss, check in was very slow, concierge was also weak (the hotel lost an important package during the event, which had been delivered but they couldn't find and insisted it hadn't). Free internet and water in your rooms would be an easy fix (\u20ac4 a bottle is not really on) Don't bother with the trendy nightclub bar at the top of the hotel, too noisy, poor cocktails, full of poseurs.

Starwood should start reviewing their hotels more carefully, otherwise, they will loss their customer base. It's our 3rd day here at W Barcelona, and here are a few things that just not up to 5 stars standard. 1) The glasses was never clean and the empty chips bag are still on the table after the room was serviced. 2) We left the robes on the bathroom floor because it was soaking wet from the shower, and expecting the housekeeping will change it. Unfortunately, we found our wet robes hang on the rack when we return, and it's still not completely dry.

This is because we feel so strongly about informing anyone and everyone who is thinking about staying here at the W to think twice before booking. Firstly the bad points which is fair to say out shines the good: 1) The hotel is lacking the basics. The glasses which we used were never cleaned after the room was serviced. My wife's lip stick marks was still clearly visible on the glass. They just emptied the contents and placed it conveniently beside the bed. 2)The toiletries have never been replaced throughout the duration of the stay so far (four days have now passed) 3) There is no turn down service in the evening. A simple and standard service which is expected from high end hotels. 4) No complimentary water - surely when paying \u00a3200 / $250USD per night one should expect to have this and not be charged 4\u20ac for a bottle from the mini bar. It made me laugh when I reached for the bottle, there was a label on the bottle neck saying \" Who' thirsty? Whisk me away 4euros!\" 5) No tea and coffee making facility in the room. Once again very basic 6) The in room dining menu is located in the room's welcome binder which when trying to locate the English version of the menu is only one page compared to the Spanish version. It takes a while to locate and by the time you find the menu you are no longer hungry. 7) The laundry service is very expensive. For a pair of jeans, a top, a pair of pyjamas and two undergarments - 80 euros! I could have hired someone local and they could have done our entire suit case! 8) No free WI FI - 19 euros per day. 9) The WC and bathroom is certainly quirky. They are both separated by frosted glass which you can still see through! Can be awkward if you are staying with someone who you are less familiar with! The sink is located in the bedroom instead of the bathroom or WC. There is no bath tub just a wet room. You have to come out in to the room to dry yourself as the shower head is located on the ceiling of the wet room and still drips after one has turned it off. 10) Service in general is slow. Good points: 1) Amazing views of the city and sea. 2) Good location as it's on the beach. 3) Good communal areas such as the lobby and lifts. To summarise, this is not for the faint hearted. Everything about this hotel is expensive. We don't mind paying for this so long as the service matches. We were expecting the \"WOW\" factor.

We had drinks at the cute bar in the lobby \u2013 dj spinning nice house music. We never made it to the upstairs club. Location: It is a good walk to the subway. But it is a beautiful walk along the beach! I never felt in danger of pickpockets or anything, even when walking home late at night. Well lit. The hotel is not in the \u201ccenter of it all\u201d in terms of tourist destinations, but with that comes peace and quiet, and ample room! Hotels in the old town or downtown tend to be much older, smaller, and noisier.

We want comfortable hotels in pretty places with good restaurants, great service and a few luxuries. We want to relax, eat, drink and be fussed over a bit. It\u2019s just our preferred vacation style, The W Barcelona certainly fulfilled our every vacation desire on our late autumn trip to Spain this year. We chose a \u201cFabulous\u201d room for the city/sea view: I love a poshy view with iPad in hand and a nice glass of wine by my side! Definitely worth the extra money. The room was lovely. Comfortable, modern elegant. The bed was extraordinarily comfortable and we loved that it was in the middle of the room. The room just demanded that you relax and enjoy yourself. The windows were spectacular. I spent hours on the window seat that extended the entire length of the room. We also both loved the rainfall showers. And my significant other, who cannot go more than a day without working, found the desk and workspaces to be more than adequate while still allowing him to feel like he was on vacation. My only small complaint is that I would have preferred that the lavatory/ dressing areas would have been more enclosed. I prefer a bit more privacy. The common areas, lobby, bars, restaurants; are just extremely well designed and executed. Nothing is left unconsidered. There are surprises and notable touches everywhere. Service is exceptional. We were taken upstairs by Frank, who spent a considerable amount of time with us, explaining important insider knowledge of the hotel and Barcelona, providing some useful tourist cautions as well as some good recommendations for dining and shopping. He could not have been more positive, upbeat, welcoming or generous with his time although we were just two average travelers on holiday from the States. The hotel is about a 10 minute taxi ride from the main part of the city, or an easy 15 bus trip(bus is frequent, cheap and easy as is the metro) and the Barceloneta(seashore village shops and dining)is a short beachside 10 minute walk. But you are not IN town if that concerns you. To be basically IN the water, you give up the closeness to town. It was no sacrifice for us. The Eclipse nightclub at the top of the W did not live up to the hype as far as we were concerned. Maybe we are too old, maybe we have been in New York too long, but it was just an average club: 5 guys to every girl and very weak drinks. The bar scene in the lobby was far more interesting. Others may completely disagree. We were there for 6 nights and the atmosphere during the week was much more low key than on the weekend when families with kids showed up, although it was never chaotic. We would not go during the high season though, I cannot imagine how wild it must be mid summer. Many others would find this Autumn time of year that we preferred far too tame for them, I would imagine. During our stay, we were surprised to suddenly find ourselves in the elevator with an extremely famous rock legend who happened to be performing in Barcelona during the time we were there. It happened that our floor also housed a couple of the large suites, one of which he was staying in. It was an unexpected and breathtaking highpoint to our trip that was pretty amazing already. As one final example of the hospitality we enjoyed at the W, we have a small Whatever/Whenever experience to share. On our last day, I got the idea that we should ask if we could see one of the suites at the end of our floor. Maybe the one the famous rock star had stayed in if it wasn\u2019t occupied? So we called and asked if we could have a tour of one of the suites. The concierge said that she would check and call me back. It actually took about an hour and I did eventually ask a second time, but sure enough finally someone called us back. It turned out that the suites were nearly all occupied except\u2026 the very biggest and grandest Presidential Suite on another floor and would we like a tour? Well, yes we would! Within a few minutes a very lovely and friendly hotel intern came to our door and took us up to a magnificent suite for a private tour. It was rather fabulous, completely fun and very generous of the W to accommodate our little whim. We are diehard W fans, and also love the W little brother, Aloft, for business travel. We are just really impressed with the brand. They just seem to have the entire concept down with, not only great facilities, but also incredibly well selected and dedicated staff.

I must say that the experience at W Barcelona far exceeeded the one in NYC. First of all, the staff were very friendly and helpful, from the receptionist to the porter to the staff at the Whatever Whenever desk. They even invited us to the bar for complimentary drinks when they were checking whether our room was ready. Unlike other travellers, my porter explained the complicated switches to us (even though we still needed some time on our own to figure it out later). The room has a great view overlooking the port and a cruise ship would arrive very now and then (unfortunately, the better view is the one facing the beach, not that we mind the port view). The Wonderful room is slightly bigger when compared to most European standard hotel rooms. The glass shower and toilet took a while of getting used to especially when you are not used to seeing someone's blurred shadow when he/she is seated on the toilet bowl). The bed is very comfy and the Bliss products are welcomed. Like the other travellers, the Wifi service is not reliable. I ended up not logging on to the internet for the 4 days when I was there (I can't be bother to use the common area PCs). The Eclipse Bar fell below expectations. I expected something even better and hippier for a W hotel since it's positioned as a very stylish hotel. The view was average (there's really nothing to see when it's dark... mind you, it's just a beach view in the dark) and the whole ambience was lacking. I've seen greater bars in Asia that come with stunning day and night scenes. The hotel staff didn't know the products well. We wanted to buy the decorative white gecko (which was for sale) in the bedroom. But none of the receptionists knew how to get a new piece for us! On the day that we were checking out, they called the house keeping and told us that the gecko would be delivered to our room but it never did. We gave up in the end. The gym is reasonable. I would consider it to be one of the better ones in Barcelona. It's equipped with the standard weight lifting and cardio equipments. And there is enough. If I recall correctly, there are 6 to 8 treadmills in the gym ( a luxury if you ask me). The food at the ground floor restaurant was mediocre. You can get better food outside the hotel. The pork which I've ordered was tough and my partner's fish was stale and rubbery (it was a pity considering they have access to the freshest fish in Barcelona). The waitress ended up offering us chocolates to help us, in her own words, \"forget the bad experience\". Go and try the Santa Caterina market in Barcelona\u2019s trendy El Born neighbourhood. The restaurant at the corner of the market serves excellent food and it's really good value for money. But be prepared to wait if you go during the peak hours. It was not that bad when we were at W Barcelona. They gave my partner a birthday cake and a bottle of sparkling wine. The cake was really good! I don't know for sure whether I would stay at W Barcelona again especially when there are so many other nicer hotels in Barcelona. I might just give it another try if the rates are reasonable. Btw, most taxi drivers do not know W Barcelona.

The location of the hotel was centrally located which was what we wanted. First impression after arriving the hotel, it had a sense of emptiness, or perhaps it was purposely made \"minimal\". The staff at the desk was very friendly and helpful, and gave us the room despite arriving early. Arriving into the room, it was bright and spacious with an excellent view of the breathtaking endless Spanish ocean. The bed was large and comfortable, we have slept well during our stay at W Barcelona. Our room was tidied on the second day, however we found that later that it was not tidied for 2 out of 5 days during our stay here which was slightly bazaar considering we did not put any signs up on our doors to stop cleaners coming in - we have only put up a sign once during our stay. Things in the room were the typical standard of 5 star hotels, but nothing worthy of the \"wow factor\". I should mention that the bathroom had a nice shower though. Food at the bottom floor restaurant was excellent. The Eclipse bar had an excellent view overlooking almost 360 degrees around the hotel, nice drinks and cocktails, unfortunately the dj was not great and the music does not really get better until around 2am, when the bar shouts at 3am. The gym was simple and well-equipped with standard equipments, however it surprised me that they did not have a hairdryer in the gym shower. Not that I couldn't dry my hair in my room but it was just unexpected when I thought this would be one of the basic equipments in the bathroom, especially after hours of working out. The wifi internet in the public area was fine on my first day of stay, however it stopped working on my Mac from the second day onwards which was frustrating and I had to work on their public computers instead. The beach nearby is lovely, however personally I wouldn't recommend people to eat in the restaurants around the area because they are highly touristic which means that they are unreasonably expensive, and more importantly, NOT outstanding food. By that I mean BELOW AVERAGE. If you are serious about your food like I am, then please don't go anywhere near these restaurants. They are many more good restaurants in Barcelona that are priced at the same level and probably below too. I would recommend people to go for a drink around the beach though - the scenery is excellent and could be very romantic if you are with your partner. If you are a party person, do not miss out the 3 clubs on the beach - just keep walking along the beach (for about 15 minutes) until you see a tall glassy building (Hotel Arts that is) nearby and several continuous restaurants (don't eat there - overpriced and below standard), if you keep walking you will eventually see the 3 clubs. I think one of which was a restaurant and club in one. Overall I would stay at this hotel again for the stunning view and beautiful natural surroundings (ie. the beach), however just don't expect very much servicing. In my experience with 5 star hotels, my time at W was just very average. No overall wow factors, just your ordinary 5 star hotel.

We were not shown to the room and so had to work out for ourselves the rather complicated lighting system. The views were spectacular.

There is a bus from the hotel and the a taxi will set you back about \u20ac8. \u2022 Turndown service is variable; one night at 10pm, another at 6pm\u2026when the maid comes to the door she knocked and then walked straight into the room. \u2022 Bath towels are small and only one was provided, more can be requested. \u2022 We were on a package which gave us wine and cheese on arrival, 2 beach towels and milk and cookies with turndown. Only one towel was provided and no milk and cookies on any of the nights. \u2022 WiFi in the reception areas was intermittent. There are 4 PCs for guest use in the business centre. \u2022 Rarely was there anyone at the front of the hotel to hail a cab. \u2022 At 9am on the final morning we were woken by drilling coming from the floor above or below, it was difficult to tell\u2026the hotel was supposedly completed a year ago. \u2022 Breakfast in the Bravo Restaurant was interesting: tea and coffee is left to stand and was never hot when served. Every morning we order fresh tea and coffee and on occasion the waiter was surly\u2026\u201cit\u2019s the same coffee\u201d \u2013 \u201cno it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s hot!\u201d; the buffet is extensive but eggs and bacon etc need to be ordered; there\u2019s no menu and we were only asked once\u2026on one occasion (at 9.30am) there was no bacon left, not that you would miss it as only one rasher is given! None of these \u201cgripes\u201d can detract from what is a very stylish hotel.

Room service was very timely, check in slow and annoying, like at other Ws I've stayed at, but the staff are always attractive.

We stayed at the W. We had read various reviews before leaving the UK so we were aware that the location had been an issue for some previous guests, but for us it was not a problem. We stayed on the 21st floor on the dock side and had amazing views. It's not so good if you suffer from vertigo, but for us it was fabulous. As the W is on the beach its great if you want to go for a long morning jog along the promenade. We did this 2 of the 3 mornings we stayed at the hotel. The room felt very spacious but in part that is because the layout is a little unconventional. The bed is in the middle of the room so that you face the window. The curtains are operated by a control panel by the bed, so when you wake up you can electronically open the curtains and admire the ocean view. This is very spectacular and very memorable. The bathroom was my main concern as it was basically a separate wet room and separate toilet with frosted glass walls leaving the sink area open to the bedroom. Whilst OK for me and my husband it might not be to everyone's taste. Also, because its so open plan, space that would normally be walled off as the bathroom is open to the bedroom, making the room feel larger. The room was full of gadgetry, but try as we might we couldn't get the TV to work via the wireless keyboard, but our ipod was docked and we managed to fill the room with our own music. There is a mood light to change the colour of your room and great seats in front of the window so you can admire the ocean. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as we never got up early enough so we cant comment on that, but we did have lunch out on the deck by the pool. The food was very good but service very slow. We used the Bliss Spaaaaaaaaaaaaah and had great massages, but there is no relaxation area for post massage wind down, and the only area to sit in has uncomfortable chairs and is brightly lit with fluorescent lighting. I think the spa interior decor is all about design rather than comfort. This is definitely something they could improve on in the Spa. There is a well equipped gym, but we didn't use it as we were out running or walking alot. On Friday night we took the lift to the 25 floor where the Eclipse nightclub is located. From here you have spectacular vies over the city and beach. The hotel manages the entrance to the bar and a queue will form every evening in the lobby of the hotel, but as we were hotel residents we could jump to the head of the queue. The bar was OK, music OK, views amazing, so it's worth a visit if you are in the hotel. To visit the city centre we walked. This was not a problem for us, but could be if you are lazy and don't want a 30 - 60 min walk. With no agenda for the weekend its nice to walk along the sea front or by the harbour towards the city centre, that way you get to sample the city vibe, so for us it was not a problem. An improvement would be for the hotel to lay on a complementary shuttle, or to provide bikes that you could borrow for a day or weekend. Whilst you can always pay for a taxi, or rent your own bikes from various rental companies, the convenience of the hotel laying these on for you would be a definite improvement.

As a member of the SPG Program, I wanted to use a combination of frequent stay points and dollars to cover a total of six nights in Barcelona, potentially an expensive proposition. The choices included the W, located on the Barceloneta beachfront, and Le Meridien, on La Rambla. We were ultimately very happy to have selected the W. While many criticize the W's location as being far removed from the Barcelona center, we found it refreshing to have a sense of open space given the beachfront location. We also really enjoyed the 15 minute walk from the W into central Barcelona. People watching is incredible! We will most likely stay there again on a future return trip. ADVANTAGES: 1) Spacious, very modern, and stylish public spaces and rooms. Loved the bath facilities and amenities (by BLISS). Mood lighting and day bed were wonderful, and the bed super comfortable. 2) Incredible views in any direction from virtually every floor. Our first set of days was in 1717 facing the port, and our second in 2306 facing the city and beachfront. 3) Very friendly and efficient service. Even though everyone seems to be style-conscious (and we're definitely not!), we always were treated well. During our first stay we had two queen beds rather than a single king (as we preferred). Even though the room (1717) was perfectly fine, the staff desperately tried to upgrade us to fulfill our original request. We ultimately stayed where we were. 4) Wonderful, spacious, and well equipped work out facility (called SWEAT). I actually cannot recall a hotel facility of this size anywhere else I've stayed. 5) Complimentary wi-fi access in the W Bar. Never pushed to order anything if I just wanted to sit and access the web. 6) The pool deck and Wet Bar takes advantage of the open space and very much creates a resort-like setting. DISADVANTAGES: 1) If you don't like to walk, the W will be a stretch given the 15 minute walking time to the nearest METRO stop in Barceloneta or the city center. 2) Not exactly an \"old Barcelona\" experience. We were fine with that since we had a lot of \"that experience\" in every other aspect of our time in the city. 3) In room internet access is very expensive. 4) Very expensive room rates, but not out of line compared to other high end Barcelona hotels (including Le Meridien and Hotel Art, a Ritz Carlton property at the opposite end of the beachfront). 5) For a large hotel creating a resort like setting, the pool is too small--and unheated! In early October with average temperatures in the mid-upper 70s, the water seemed frigid. It's possible to do laps (which I tried), but I couldn't stay in the water for more than about 5-10 minutes.

The view from the room is fabulous just picture laying in bed and opening the curtains electronically and looking directly out to sea from the luxury of your wonderfully comfortable bed. The hotel is exceptionally modern throughout. The concierge team are very helpful. They gave us a map and wrote names of vasrious tapas places to try and highlighted the best places to visit. The pool bar is great, very comfi, great service and as the evening sets in they bring out lights and cushions to transpose it into an evening bar. The bar at the top is also fantastic. We were only going to go up there for an hour for a night-cap, but ended up staying until 4am. The music was great and the guy playing the bongos whilst standing on the bar got the crowd going. The W has it's own little stretch of beach which was run by the Mellon beach club which had an efficient booking in system to reserve sun loungers. They were very comfortable and the beach service was very good. The W is as some have said a little way away from Las Ramblas, but we didn't mind as the walk was very pleasant around 20 mins. Barcelona is a fantastic city, lots to see. The cable car was good fun and gave you a good view of the city. The cathederal was worth seeing, but the Sagrada Familia was much better. I do agree with another reviewer that the price is excessive considering the inside is under constrcuction. The outside is the best bit and free. The magic fountain is ok, but don't look for anything other than quite a big fountain with a few lghts that change colour to music that you can barely hear. Try tapas 24, which was recommednded by the concierge, mmmm. Las Ramblas is similar to Covent Garden with many street performers and places to eat and drink, nice atmosphere. Do go to the indoor food market, wow that's what I call a market, all fresh food from sea food, hams, sweets and chocolate to fruit, dried fruit and more. Barcelona is not a cheap city though. You will pay around 50 euros for lunchtime tapas for 2 with a bottle of decent (not dead expensive) wine. A glass of beer nearly everywhere was 5 euros. Pros - well all of the above, a modern stylish hotel with good night life, by the beach with good views out to sea, excellent staff and lovely chic rooms. Cons - only ate 1 evening meal which was ok, but not great. The w is not a cheap hotel to eat and drink in. Havng said that if you want all of the above you have to expect to pay for it. You will pay 5 euros for an average size glass of coke on the beach. In the bar you will pay around 9 euros for a vodka and tonic. We are used to these prices as drinkining in hotels is London is quite costly, but if you are not they will seem a liitle steep.

Our suite was incredible with superb views out to sea and across to Montjuic. The decor is very stylish and the bed is so comfortable we are buting one for our new appartment. Our Welcome pack was not there and we had to call for it to come. The music from the 26th floor Eclipse bar kept us awake as did the very audible sound of toilets flushing above us - this is worse than poor in a top suite in a 5 star hotel.

This is not 5 star service although we did receive a bunch of flowers and a bottle of champagne in our new room. Service in general was good by the pool but always slow.In the Bravo restaurant the service was so bad for a \"name brand\" restaurant that we ended up serving ourselves drinks.

I would start with the following; -music from Eclipse should not disturb top paying Guests - Randomly closing fire screen doors seen on floors 25 and 20. - Staff should smile at Guests - it works! -Stained carpet, sink and windowsill in 2001 - Staff need name tags - signs of protein spill in pool August 20th in the morning and all day. -service on upper sun deck stops at 6.00pm without prior warning. - bar on upper sun deck was never open despite hotel being full. -corridor on floor E to Bliss Spa has badly scuffed walls -all doors and walls near service exits are scuffed and marked - Reservation & billing system needs com,plete overhaul. - Guest service recovery is going to be more effective and cheaper when taken care of right away.

Unlike some other reviews, I did like the location: It's at the port, fantastic overall views, and you can walk along the promenade to numerous beach-restaurants and bars. If you'd like to hire a bike, it's a 5-minute walk to the store and for 10\u20ac a day, you can rent a great bike. It takes 20 minutes to walk to the nearest subway-station (Barceloneta); not a big deal, unless you like to sit and do nothing all day. Now, enough said about the location and the great materials they use in the hotel-lobby, restaurants and outside terraces \u00e1nd rooms. So: The GREAT things: - Location and view! (I was on the 17th floor, south side) - Outside and inside look & feel The BAD things: - Staff is in general (i did find a few staff-members who do know to treat a 5-star hotel guest!!) not well trained, noisy, very re-active in stead of pro-active and can be friendly only when asked for service. An exception for the reception-staff; they made me feel at home and were courteous. But: the lines at the desks are far too long and sometimes a receptionist just disappears. - Bar-staff is really unmotivated and only busy with themselves. - Breakfast-restaurant-staff is disorganized, noisy and have no idea what they are doing. Their main goal seems to be filling up coffee-cans and juicecans, but won't ask if you'd like (another) cup of coffee, unless called. - Terrace-staff is incredibly unaware of guest-needs. They just walk by, don't greet, don't ask if you'd like to drink or eat anything and some have the looks as if they work at the nearest chiringuito (beachbar). Absolutely terrible and what's worse for the hotel: They miss income. - Restaurant (dinner)-staff is curteous overall, do have a pro-active attitude, but some clearly were in a bad mood or were commenting other staff's behaviour in front of guests. Internet-conexions: - Room: \u20ac5 for 1 hr, \u20ac8 for 2 hrs, \u20ac19 for 24 hours. Wifi didn't work. I was charged -of course-, but found a pleasant surprise in the room the next day: A cable. Didn't work. - Lobby: Is for free, wifi works good; it will tell you it's for 24 hours, but after that it just starts again. Pity you have to look for plugs, cause those are not standard. Where the lamps are, there are the plugs! - Business-centre: 4 home pc's, very slow. Not good. So, overall: Beautiful place, you might run into celebs, but for the rest: Poor service.

Also, from the shower, you are getting out right into the room. There are no bathtubs in any of the room categories.

Problem... not a sun bed to be had. Plenty of sun beds but all with towels on them, sadly a lot of them without people on the towels just a magazine or two and a tube of sun cream. Not to be beaten a kind member of staff directed us to the beach club. If you want a double bed here that was all that was left, a hundred euros was the charge.. In that it was 4 30 in the afternoon i did not think we could possibly spend a hundred euros in drinks and food. Never mind the next day we will get a sun bed!!! Wrong this went on for three days until hating myself our last morning i too headed down to the pool at eight thirty to throw towels magazines and sun oil on three sunbeds knowing i would not be using them till after 2 pm. Management Please unless people are using the sun beds right away DONT let them hog them for the whole day.. It spoiled a wonderful experience for us when after a day in your wonderful city a lie in the sun and a swim would have been lovely.

I've stayed in better camp sites and this hotel. I suprised my wife for our 4th wedding anniversary and thought I would treat her to a luxury hotel. we arrived at around 12 and our room was not ready understandable as check in is at 2, fine, we wondered around exploring and checking out the facilites. after an over priced beer and coke we went back to check in, guess what room not ready, 100 euros later and 4 o'clock we final got our room which was already wrong I requested a sea view and got a construcion site with 2 cranes, lovely! room 337 (fantastic suite). we got moved to the top floor 25th (room 2502), great. We were told that it is below the sky bar (more like night club if you like hard core rave) and on the managers promise was told it is not noisy, HA. We requested a move and nothing could be done, by the way it closes as 2.30am during the week and at 4 on weekends, in our three nights there we had about 10 hours sleep. 3 hours on our last night when we had to get up early for our flight, great way to prepare for an early flight and if you try to phone and complain they transfer you to a call centre in america and then charge you for the call, customer service at its best. Now to the hotel its self, to the naked eye it looks great but i work in the construction engineering industry and the hotel design is atroshish we had a toilet door that would not close because of the carpet, cracks and dirt on the walls, unfinished paint jobs and the lighting system is rubbish, it's just sheer poor workmanship. The pool is another matter, i've seen bigger baths! and don't get me started on some of the pompous guests who think they are above other guests and show no common descency. Some of the staff are kind and friendly and our final meal at Wave was nice (too little too late) however the pool staff and the mellow bar staff are crap! you wait 25 mins for a single bottled beer and pay 10 euros for a plate of chips which look like tooth picks and come cold.

Eat elsewhere. - the service at the pool could be quicker. Although I do understand, as there are a lot of people, probably ordering food all at once. Service is always (very) friendly though! - prices are high. Even if you book a room through an online price-breaker, spending time in the hotel, means spending (a lot) of money. 12\u20ac for a (mediocre) cocktail? 20\u20ac+ for a tray of little fried snacks? Again: eat elsewhere! :) - parking a car is expensive. We paid close to 25\u20ac/day and there's not much of an alternative (seeing the pretty distant location of the hotel). - the location. It's perfect for the views, but quite distant to the centre of Barcelona. There's a bus which stops in front of the hotel though, so it's not that big of a problem. Be careful though: these busses don't run at night! (but we enjoyed our daily stroll back to the hotel at night ;) ) - the crowd. It's young & \"hip\". Possibly a bit too hip (read: snobbish). Probably not recommended for older people (50+). Having said that: we met some lovely people at the pool, from all over the globe. That's about it (and I'm being VERY critical now).

When we arrived in the room, my first comment was \"wow!\" & we are not easily impressed. We had a room with a terrace & the views were absolutely gorgeous of the sea & the beach/cruise port. A few of the days the wind off the ocean made the terrace a bit chilly, but the weather warmed up & the wind died down the second half of our stay. The room wasn't cheap so our expectations were high, but it didn't dissapoint. Since it was my husband & I, we weren't put off by the close proximity of the bed to the tub, toilet & shower, but, can understand why some folks might. The room was basically white with white furniture & there were numerous marks/scuffs - did not seem like such a wise decorating choice for rooms that get daily wear & tear. The sofa didn't have any arms on so made relaxing a bit of a challenge. Our door keys worked without any difficulty. The amentities in the room were Bliss spa soaps & shampoos, so they were nice. No problems with shower leaks of any kind. The lighting system was a bit complex to work & clearly needs to be addressed as it causes more time/trouble than it's worth. The room was very clean, other than the scuffs. Our only dissapointment was the concierge staff /whatever/whenever approach. Each of them were very nice. But, with the exception of one staff member, they didn't seem to have a clue about where the good local places were that weren't \"tourist traps.\" The first evening there we asked for their recommendation & they booked us at a restaurant about a 6 minute walk along the beach from the hotel & this restaurant was one of their \"top recommendations.\" Talk about a \"tourist trap\" - the restaurant was filled with other folks from the hotel (we began talking between tables) & not one local. Our only thought was that they must have some relationship with this restaurant or maybe get some kind of kick-back for booking folks there. The seafood was average - nothing exceptional to say the least & we were very dissapointed. From there on, we decided to find our own restaurants & with one exception, did much better - found the places the locals went to with great food. For a hotel that is a major player in the market, it seemed that the conceirge staff weren't organized or trained very well for that matter for a hotel of that caliber. The other issue with the conceirge was that there was always a line-up. As one other reviewer noted, a line started, but then someone inevitably would walk up & start his/her own line & be served while the rest of us stood in lthe original ine. They need at least another two staff members there during the peak times. Also, if you called the \"whatever/whenever\" telephone line, you were always on hold for what seemed like days. We had breakfast each morning at the hotel buffet at Bravo & the food was very enjoyable. There was a strawberry/rubarb marmalade that was absolutely delicous & you could toast brioche for a real treat. Also, a hot chicken & meatball dish, numerous dried meats, tomato, breads, yogurts, fresh fruits, pastries, smoothies, cheeses & cereals. The wait staff members tried hard but seemed to be a bit disorganized with frequent confusion on who ordered which coffees & eggs (eggs were included in the buffet price but cooked to order) each & every day. But, after a while it became part of the charm of the place because they seemed to be trying so hard. Had dinner at Bravo one night & the food was very good, not great, but very good & reasonably priced. The service was excellent. Had drinks & tapas at the hotel main floor bar - the service was sketchy, so as long as you weren't in a hurry, the drinks were good as was the food. The almonds served with the drinks were delicious. One of our dishes came out cold, but as soon as we brought it to our server's attention, it was immediately addressed & we got a freshly prepared dish that was piping hot. We ordered a cheese plate one day & asked for some additional bread & got a large plateful - nothing shy about quantity. We went up to the Eclipse bar for drinks one night & found it to be nothing great but the views. but, we're over 40 so probably not their target audience. We didn't see \"drunk kids\" in the lobby or in the bars as one reviewer did. Service was always friendly & nice, but very relaxed so you just learned to relax too. We would definitely stay there again as the accommodation & views could not be beat.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cMade our wonderful Barcelona trip perfect!\u201d", "Author": "prazzbo", "ReviewID": "UR68755219", "Content": "This is my second time to Barcelona.

The room was fantastic and the views of the sea were unbelievable. The W bed never disappoints and the room design was fun, offering \"wow\" lights behind the bed, automatic open and close buttons for the drapes, a personal martini station at the foot of the bed, etc. We used Whatever/Whenever for dinner reservations (thats the name of their concierge) and they were very helpful (Isabella, in particular). They do not have menu books but do show you the website of the restaurant and most of them did have english menus. They also set up a private Gaudi tour for us, and our tourguide was fantastic. We were also able to borrow some umbrellas and an extra outlet converter, free of charge. We loved Bliss spa. We went twice and both times the staff were friendly and professional. Prices were the same as home (NYC) and offered access to the steam room, sauna, and jacuzzi. These were co-ed so every guest was required to wear a bathing suit. The relaxation room was typical, with magazines, cheese, fruit, champagne, etc. The only thing that was a little strange was that sometimes staff members of the opposite sex entered the locker room. The gym is fantasic. They have gymsource equipment and a large selection of weight machines, stationary bikes, treadmills, and ellipiticals. They also have a large studio. Given the size, amount of equipment, and the studio I wonder if they will eventually hold classes and allow for paid memberships to non hotel guests. The hiccups: First, the restaurant, Bravo 24. This is the same chef as Comerc 24 (Michelin rated) and Tapas 24. We went on a Sunday night. We love seafood and were pleased with the extensive seafood selection. It was our anniversary and the concierge had recommended this restaurant. You can imagine our disappointment when the waiter explained that most of the seafood selections were unavailable that night since it was a Sunday. If we had known they would not have most of the selections available we would have eaten somewhere else. Imagine sitting down to eat at a nice restaurant and being told that a majority of the selections listed are not available. Given that this is the hotel's premier restaurant (and the chef associated with this restaurant) we were terribly disappointed in the meal. Second, the room cards. Every day, sometimes twice a day, our room cards did not work. The front desk would reactivate them, they would work once, and then not work again. Imagine almost every time you want to return to your room you have to go back on the elevator to the lobby and then wait for somoene to become available and reactivate your key. They did nothing to fix the situation despite repeated complaints. Room service. One day we had room service delivered about a half an hour late. My hot breakfast was cold. The fruit was the table scraps. There was something on our table that we did not recognize. What made this situation worse is that the person who delivered the breakfast didnt speak a word of english. We used the English menu on our door and we are gold preferred (5 star hotels should know their preferred guests) Clearly we are English speaking guests. What could have been resolved quickly turned into another 20 minute ordeal because this woman couldnt understand anything I was saying. In the end, our romantic breakfast was ruined because my husband had to eat his hot meal while room service fixed mine or his would have been cold. Finally, their service was fantastic when things went well. However, when there is a problem their service level drops dramatically. Granted it is a new hotel but it seemed like whenever there was a problem I was dealing with a deer in headlights. Apologies were nice but there was little effort beyond this. At one point I asked to speak to the manager and was told he would call my room later that night. Needless to say, he never called. Overall, we did love the hotel for our one week stay. The hiccups were unfortunate and I prefer to think its because its a new hotel. Aside from the keycard problem the other complaints were isolated incidents. The lobby was inviting and relaxing, the pool area was set up perfecly, and we truly felt relaxed and on vacation. The staff at the pool, the bars, Eclipse, etc were all wonderful, the rooms were great, and it was the perfect combination of beach and European city vacation.

Its 2.15 in the morning and I am writing this review from the W Hotel bedrrom as there is no chance of getting any sleep with the outdoor nightclub by the pool staying open all night. Putting aside the fact that this hotel is in a stunning position overlooking the sea its a joke! No managfement ever present, staff have no idea how to genuinely listen and handle real guest complaints, nightclubs all over the building streaming with drunk kids in the pool, lobby bar and top floor make it a noisy sleasy and distateful place to stay. I was in BCN on Business and being an avid W fan, thought I would try the new W by the sea, boy, was I taken for a ride with this place. I had thought about bringing my partner to barcelona for a long weekend in the future, so I wanted to try it out in advance and i am very glad I did. This hotel is a disgrace and it starts as soon as you walk in the door. Literally. What strikes me is that there appears to be no managment in the hotel, ever! I arrived by cab at the W and was happliy greeted by a doorman with a friendly smile and a trolley. he took me in through a door to the left of the main doors and as he pulled it open the bottom hit the inbuilt up light in the paving. What amazed me was that this place has been open 8 months and basic things like the light fittings and front door hitting still are not fixed. Over the course of my stay i watched that door and light get smashed over a dozen times, amazingly the brass light fitting casing seemed to be wearing better than the door! Checkin was interesting. 3 chest high desks for guest to go up to. However if they are all busy, a sort of line gets created, not behind any particular checkin counter but somewhere in front. So if you join the cue, with 6 people already waiting patiently you move to the 1st open desk. Thats fine unless some smart kid decides to jjump in and just walk up to a desk and start a new line. This was a regular occurance and the wait would sometimes be nearly 15 minutes. As frustrating and disorganised as it is, especially since I had to have my room keys re issued 4 times for no reason other than the door wouldnt unlock, the hotel doesnt seem to care, with no effort made to manage the cues of crowds. So after recieving the key, I made my way up to the 12th floor and my \"Wonderful room!\" Room was interesting with some nice mod design elements but some very basic and poor issues to address, like: Toilet roll hung beind the user not to the side. There are two phones in the room, but only one works. No complimentary water No turndown service Scuff marks and chipped paint throughout the room Shwioer leaks wwater out and onto the carpet. Toilet and shower face out and open onto the bed as far as overall services: Concierge has no clue even about the hotels own top restaurant and its menu. Concierge has no comprehension of a proper 5 star hotels guests expectatons. Nightclub by the pool makes horrendus noise late into the morning. Nightclub on the top floor has amazing views but is full of drunk tourists. Reception desk process is horrendous To find the Gym, a laberinth of tunnels, staircases and mystery doors will ebe=ventually lead to a well stocked and equipped gym Pool staff are living in fairy land, slow, dont listen, dont acknowledge guests when called and down right useless. the nthere is the wateverwhenver pohone service. Basically the operator on \"0\" The promise with whatever whenever is to deliver! The truth is a sharp contrast. Whatever whenever staff are inconsistent and dont understand a gests needs. in other words useless. I could go on and on and on, but its just depressing know that i have paid 240Euro a night to put up with this rubbish service and lack of managment.

You will spend some time just wandering around taking in the stunning decor which has to be a new benchmark in style at a worldwide level. We were really spoiled by being SPG upgraded to an amazing suite (I think it was a Fabulous room) high up on the 25th floor. (Even though the nightclub was one floor above us, there was actually very little noise from it at night, it was well soundproofed.) We had two large beautifully appointed rooms (see photos, one living, one bedroom) with 2 huge windows facing the beach and a huge bathroom with a bath you could scuba in, as well as an extra powder room with toilet and trendy round pedestal basin. It had so many extra gadgets - like iPhone docking station, sound system, 2 big flat screen TVs that doubled as computer screens, different coloured mood lighting that could be changed in each room (pink, green, turquoise) but oddly it was missing any inbuilt tea/coffee making facilities however on request they supplied a kettle, cups and milk on a tray, which came with a little shooter glass of coloured jellybeans! We managed to plug the kettle in the bathroom, which had an enormous vanity with lots of room for our toiletry bags, plenty of lovely quality Bliss products in big bottles and lots of enormous thick towels. As we were on a full round the world trip, we had tons of baggage but the closet was also really big so we could spread out and even managed find items we had lost in our cases. Staff were very friendly and helpful, in line with their signature W \"anything/anytime\" policy - restaurant recommendations, sightseeing, timing and distances. Free wifi internet in the ground floor breakfast restaurant and foyer/bar/coffee lounge, so take your laptop. (You pay for internet access in rooms, but plenty of room downstairs.) Pool area looked good but it was still a bit too cool when we were there in March. Beach also looked good for swimming in warmer weather. The location is good - a pleasant short walk along the marina towards town uncovered a multitude of little harbourside restaurants, selling everything from paella to pizza and steak at good prices, and the local wine was pretty reasonable too. If you are too tired to walk after a busy day you only are a very short cheap taxi ride - 5 or 6 euros - to or from the main Old City area and Las Ramblas - the taxi drivers understand \"Vella\" (sail) better than \"W Hotel\".

So I can't say anything about its value of money, but W Barcelona is a hotel that I would definitely get money from my pocket to pay for, just for a short getaway inside the hotel without doing much outdoor travelling! The first impression on the hotel was: WOW. The sail-shaped hotel really stands out from far away. Its arresting position on one end of the beach @ Barcelonetta has given the hotel a perfect 360'C seaview very close to the Mediterranean Sea and the famous Port. The interior is edgy but not really in a pompous way - which makes it a very captivating option for young hipsters I bet. And you can trust the official images found on this page - the real look of the hotel is very close to what you see from them! Staff can't be more friendly, I would say. The check-in guy was friendly and trying his best to make sure my impression on the hotel was good. From the bell-boys to bar waiters to the Whatever/Whenever attendants whom you can just call ANYTIME for ANYTHING, everyone is being nice, cool and super friendly. So don't worry because they would not be pushy or too much. My room overlooks the beach, which is so stunning that during my stay I spent at least 15 minutes every day to sit on the window-side couch just to look at the surfers and wanderers along the beach! But I heard from companions that rooms overlooking the other side (i.e. The Port) is no less stunning. So in W Barcelona you don't really have to worry about missing any good views. Every room comes with a stunning view! I agree with the previous review that basic service has room for improvement. As I checked around the room when I first got in, I found no complimentary water (but yes the 4EURO bottles are everywhere), no complimentary tea or coffee. So I had to get a kettle and boil my own water every day. And I had to ask for a dental kit every day. TV is quite boring I would say, all news channels around Europe but no free movie channel like Hallmark/ HBO, etc. So be prepared for paid movies / soaps if you really want in-room entertainment. But I really have to say the BLISS amenities are stunning! They have shampoo, conditioner, body wash - and facial wash! I particularly enjoyed the breakfasts at BRAVO 24. The little, wooden restaurant overlooks the beach, giving you a breezy breakfast time. The range of food is not comprehensive, but enough to give you a bonne apetit. And every breakfast guest will be served with a box with some toasts, little cakes and different kinds of jams / olive oil / vinegar etc + a customised map of barcelona with restaurants recommended by the Chef. That's very sweet, no? As for the design of the room, I don't want to repeat what others have said. You can check my pictures and decide on your own. But my personal experience is that - I found it completely indulgent just to stay in the room net-surfing (20EURO per day) or looking at the beach. The smartly designed room is very very cosy.", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Hotel , Shame about the Staff !\u201d", "Author": "bright0nbelle", "ReviewID": "UR61393557", "Content": "Myself, my Husband and 14 year old son stayed at the W for 4 nights in April.

We pointed out that we had booked for 3 people and there had been no mention of this when we made the reservation. She called over someone who must have been more senior and they huddled together over the paperwork, occasionally looking up with condescending little smiles. Eventually they conceded and waived the additional 240e but it was not the most auspicious of starts and really soured the arrival experience. The staff have that slightly imperious demeanor that you occasionally find in very high end establishments. It should be pointed out that no matter how slick and cool your establishment, nothing beats a good old fashioned warm welcome! We had no complaints with the room. Beautifully kitted out , Fabulous shower, Magnificent View, Really Superb. The price tags on everything, as mentioned in other reviews, are a little off putting and unnecessary. We did note that an ornamental gecko, that was 30E in our room was priced at 40E in our friends suite. Cynical exploitation or what ? Well we had a great few days in spite of everything and on checking out were not surprised to see our bill was incorrect. I gently pointed out that we had prepaid for our reservation and did not have a car at the hotel as we had arrived by plane so could they please remove the room and garage charges which they duly did.

Our choice of hotel was influenced by the fact that we had accumulated Starwood SPG points and intended to use them to partially pay for our stay. The W hotel is a fabulously modern hotel in a striking location on the beach in Barceloneta. Everything about the hotel is space age, cutting edge technology. This is not particularly to my taste but if you like this sort of thing then it will not disappoint. The rooms are adequately sized with a large king sized bed, our room on the sixteenth floor had stunning views of the port and the sea. The toilet and shower are integrated into the bedroom behind frosted glass partitions, the wash basin is actually in the room. This is a format which is becoming increasingly more popular in trendy hotels and again this is not to my personal liking but I suppose it makes hotel rooms cheaper to build. A short course on how to operate the array of lighting in the room would be beneficial ! Nothing in the W hotel is complimentary so if you open one of the bottles of water on your bedside table it will cost you four euro. The hotel had emailed us prior to our arrival to inquire if they could do anything to make our stay more enjoyable, we took them up on their offer and informed them that we were in fact celebrating our wedding anniversary and that any gesture would be appreciated. That was the last we heard of this ! We could not find much wrong with the hotel but there were a few small lapses in service which should not occur in a hotel which aspires to this standrad. Toiletries, shower gel etc. had to be requested each night as they were not replaced by housekeeping and then only one single sized bottle of each was supplied between two of us. On one occasion ice was requested and did not arrive until it was requested a second time. Interestingly there was no customer satisfaction survey to be found anywhere and on checking out nobody was concerned as to whether or not we had enjoyed our stay or had any problems. Hotel management might wish to re-deploy some of the cool and trendy young men in the hotel lobby to more basic core duties ! The W hotel is about fifteen minutes bus ride from Catalunya Square and is at the very end of the 17 bus terminus. Buses are very frequent and cost \u20ac1.40 for a single journey, multi trip integrated travel passes can be purchased at the Metro station and are very convenient (\u20ac11.50 for two days unlimited travel on all city transport). Airport buses to each terminal leave from the Square and cost \u20ac5.00 for a single journey. The Metro is also easy to negotiate but be very careful of thieves and educate yourself as to their operating methods before you leave home. If I was returning to Barcelona for a short break I would prefer to stay in the city centre for convenience but the W is still a very good hotel which could be excellent with a little more attention to detail. On an un-related note Barcelona is an expensive city and on top of this some cafes etc. are more than willing to fleece tourists so don't be afraid to ask the price of everything before you purchase.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna", "Title": "\u201cJust WOW\u201d", "Author": "Ralph28Vienna", "ReviewID": "UR60493590", "Content": "We stayed at the W Barcelona for 3 nights at the end of March and it was simply amazing.

With views out over the sea and the port. What makes the rooms at the W so special is (to my mind) also their undoing. They are incredibly gadget-based: Mood lighting, electronically controlled blinds and curtains. So this also means that every time you turn the light on you end up hitting the wrong buttons and closing the curtains or turning on the under-bed lighting instead of the lounge area light..... oh it's all very complicated. The other thing I do not like is the fact that various items in the room - the water, the ornament, the books have a price tag underneath. Ok this may dissuade the accidental dropping of said items into your suitcase as you leave but for the nightly rate this seems a little bit odd. Also for the nightly rate I would expect complimentary water and also expect the towels to be changed (or at least tidied up) with the turndown service which they were not. Internet and movie channels also seemed expensive. My final gripe is that the ultra coolness does not extend to the food in the hotel which is mediocre, a bit pretentious and seriously over priced. All that said, the hotel is stunning and in an enviable location looking out over the Med'. It is a short-ish walk from the metro and a reasonable walk into town.

You guys keep a line and a guest list downstairs to bust the interest and mystique but upstairs it\u2019s a senseless cheap bar. Moreover kind of\u2019 empty. There are more people waiting in line that guests in the bar itself\u2026 - I\u2019ve paid my stay with a credit card. Three days after I\u2019ve left the card would hold a deposit guarantee in excess of 2,000 Euros (my whole bill was under 2,000 Euros and that because I\u2019ve used a lot of extra charges \u2013 limousine with driver each day for one). Why would you do that after someone is gone? Paid and gone? One may go over limit on his card because of this glitch. Once someone pays and leaves and the room is checked by your staff (which has to be done the same day one would presume) release all deposits and guarantees! Please review this practice. You are actually double-charging for a week AFTER the client is gone. It\u2019s annoying!", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "katonah, ny", "Title": "\u201cVery modern hotel with beautiful views of the water\u201d", "Author": "pepper99", "ReviewID": "UR58625566", "Content": "We have just returned from a short stay at this hotel in Barcelona.

It is a W Hotel, so it has flat screen TVs, gadgets that open and close the blinds, mood lighting, etc. I cannot say enough about the front desk staff and the concierge staff. They were friendly, efficient, willing to do anything for us to help us have a great stay. Yes, I wish they had more English channels on the TV.

The room I stayed in definitely had the 'wow!' factor. I have stayed at many hotels, but upon entering my room I was very impressed with the view: the sea from one window and the beach from the other. I believe the superior rooms all have sea view, the others look out over an industrial harbour. The room had lots of fun and original touches: coloured lighting, art, fabulous shower room, very comfortable bed, ipod base and speaker for use with own ipod. I found connecting to wireless was flaky in the room, worked well in business area. The hotel opened 1 month ago, and the inexperience from some staff at the bar/ restaurant area was evident when I asked for some food in between breakfast and lunch, in not being 100% helpful, so ordered room service in the end. I am sure this will soon improve. Concierge and particularly room service staff were fantastic. The hotel has a very nice pool outside with great seating and lounge areas, all very cool and understated. Ambient music playing everywhere. You can walk onto the beach from stairs in the lobby area. I didn't use the spa or fitness area, if I had known how beautiful the hotel was I would have taken my gym outfit. The edge of Barcelona centre is about half an hour walk away, along the beach and harbour. The club on one of the top floors had a DJ, but I did not see a dance floor, it\u2019s all about seeing and being seen, it\u2019s obvious that the cooler locals are staking-out this hotel.

My family (3 Adults + 2 Children) stayed a week in the hotel to escape the frigid winter in Paris (imagine that). If the view from our rooms was not what it was, I would complain about the price. When we arrived only one of our adjoining rooms was ready so we settled in our smaller room. There was a nice view of the beach and ocean but, I was not impressed and I started thinking about how much this week was going to cost. A couple hours later the bellman brought our key to our adjoining suite... As we entered the Cool Corner Suite we saw the same view as our other room and I was a little disappointed then, the calculator in my head started adding numbers again. As I turned right just past the elegant bathroom and shower and wonderfully laid out master suite my jaw dropped for a minute or two, at that moment I knew why my wife picked this room. I would compare the Cool Corner suite to the Presidential Suite on the Liberty of the Seas, Royal Caribbean Cruise Ship. The look and design of the hotel is impressive and a true icon on the Barcelona shoreline. We walked the beach the first day and took pictures with the sand sculpture artist (a must see). It is located on the beach and even in December we had a couple warm days and my kids loved the beach. Needs Improvement: 1. The food in the hotel is super expensive. My wife and I were leaving for dinner one night and my kids were hungry so we ordered room service. Two cheeseburgers, fries and desserts was 130 euros. 2. The beach is a double edged sword as there were nude men on the beach on two separate ocassions. 3. The concierge staff really tried but, it did not appear they had extensive knowledge of the local restaurants. We did better calling ourselves to make reservations. In typical expensive hotels the concierge has relationships with the local vendors. At times they seemed overwhelmed. They were good but not great. Overall I thought this was a great trip and hotel stay. My kids ask about returning to Barcelona and the W someday. I guess is was the 30 euro cheese burgers that put them over the top. We may visit again during the summer.

Great views. A bit of a walk in to town but my wife and I didn't mind it. A nice way to start the morning and end the evening out. Rooms are nice and well kept.

We stayed a few floors below and it was a pain to have to go to the ground floor just to get the North-West elevator back up to the bar. I did however like the fact that they don't let just anyone go up there not making the effort to dress up. Note that denim is fine. I noticed some local kids (acting like they were rich 'n' famous dressed terribly) weren't allowed in and that made me a little more comfortable. Security guards hover around the foyer area and stand by the elevators. The first time we went up to our room they did ask us if we were guests of the hotel and we showed our room card (key). I asked why they asked and their reply \"we have a lot of people coming in just to have a look around and for the safety and security of our guests we do not allow non-guests to look around the floors\". Valid response I thought and felt even more privileged to be staying there. I did notice alot of people looking around inside that weren't guests and asking about the price of the rooms. The stairs in the foyer to the left (as you walk in) goes down to the beach. Nice touch I thought. Would I stay here again? definitely.

Of all the hotels we stayed, this was the most disappointing one. Unless you like the beach,the location is out of town . One can take bus No 17 outside the hotel( about 3 minute walk and buy a barcelona card T10 if possible ) There are taxis readily available when we were there. However returning to the hotel by taxi at times can be quite problematic cos we do encounter some drivers who do not know where it was or not heard of it.even though we gave them the address or mention W or Hotel Vela. Finally we found the best would be to get a map from the concierge which has a photo of W hotel printed on it and show it to them. The sheltered entrance to the hotel is block off for security reason and after being drop off one has to walk a short distance in the open which is not pleasant in the cold, wet and rainy winter , with shopping bags in hand and for guests who need wheelchair When we check in, there were issues with our reservations which were subsequently resolved but no explanations were given. we had booked three rooms but the reception insisted that only 2 rooms were booked. Luckily , i had a print out of my stay hotel . i would rate the service at check in less than satisfactory. I also inquire about a suite upgrade but was not given cos it was unavailable The hallway to the room is dark and the walls are brown . There was loud music but it did penetrate into the room. The room though plush , spacious, modern and has comfortable W signature beds has drawbacks. It takes time to figure out how some of the light switches operates. There is no separating wall between the bedroom and the bath area.Also there is no dry area to change into fresh dry clothes in the wet shower and it has a translucent glass panel so there was no privacy so to speak. . The 5 star hotel provides Bliss shower amenties but no shower cap,cotton buds etc. The bedroom slippers are complimentary to use in the room and we were told there would be a atrocious 9 euro chrge if we took them away. Do they recycle them fro future use? Bottled water is charged at 4 euro. The rooms do not have a doorbell and a knock can be inaudible if one is not attentive or watching TV. unless one knock hard and long enough. Also if you have a message, the tv would spring into a siren like mode which get louder n louder which it did one late night when we were sleeping. Upon checking out , it was upsetting to find that we were wrongly billed. The saving grace and the oustanding feature is W concierge team which provides the finest and most excellent service.
