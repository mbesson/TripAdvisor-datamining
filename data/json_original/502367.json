I found this hotel myself, by browing TA and then asked my office in IST to book it for me. I arrived early morning from a night flight, so my room was not ready, but it was made ready in about 30 minutes. In the mean time, I checked my email, and had a glass of water kindly brought to me by reception. They also offered me to have breakfast while I wait, but I was not hungry. The room was good, not really small as someone described it in one of the reviews, and everything was fine in the room. Of course, I was not in the hotel for most of the day, but nevertheless. I did not interact much with the reception and other staff, but from what I could judge based on my small interactions with them, they were polite and efficient. Internet was great and worked with no problems, room was clean and the shower was good! I noticed some renovations going on there, but it did not really spoil the entrance area. As usual, the location in Taksim makes any stay great, even a very short one as mine.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo, Egypt", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay and Service could not be better\u201d", "Author": "ismailTourist", "ReviewID": "UR127042315", "Content": "Rive hotel is definitely an amazing hotel , rooms are very modern and beds are so comfortable , Rooms provided with LCD TV , window overlooking the city and can be opened partially . The restaurant was very amazing , what's better then having a breakfast in the morning overlooking the local people and the police doing there everyday activities , but the variation wasn't good , it had some basic food not so big. staff were fantastic , though , no one talked English even the reception desk staff , but they were very kind to us , they did their best to make us happy , they always had a smile on their face , they were sitting with us sometimes and laughing with us . very friendly . Cafe was good , perfect juices and tea and coffe. Location could not be better , in the local area , there are tons of hotels but they're inside so they will need more effort getting to The main street then from the main street to Taksim square , but Rive was directly on the same street , though , it was not on it I mean it was little inside for more quietness . it was only 5 mints. walk to Taksim. there were plenty of small groceries just next to the hotel and Mobile cards shop. all people were friendly . and In and before Taksim , there are tons of restaurants including McDonald's and Pizza Hut and Burger King , also there are endless food opportunities at the Istiklal avenue just beside Taksim.

I needed to check in the hotel in the morning to get ready for the day time ceremony which was starting at 12:00 pm. So called Riva Hotel reception and asked them if they can arrange a room for me in the morning rather than usual 12:00 check in time. The receptionist told me that it would not be a problem as some guests leave early in the morning due to flight etc. When I got there at about 10:45 am there was no problem about the room. they show the way to my room straight away. Even though I booked a single room they gave me a double room with two single beds. The bathroom needed updating but was very clean so didn't mind it that much. I found the hotel staff very friendly, helpful and proffessional. Also they send one of their staff to currency exchange bureau near them for me as I did not have Turkish Lira on me to pay for the taxi. They brought the money along receipt. Even though it's close to extremely busy Taksim square didn't hear traffic noise at all. It's situated in the corner location on a road off Taksim Square. Very convenient location. The airport shuttle bus stop was just round the corner in the square (30 seconds from hotel) so didn't have any problem to get to the airport in time. I paid only 10 Turkish Lira for the shuttle bus.So all in all it was a very plesant stay.

The only weak point is the noise protection, not so much from the streets (the hotel is in a pedestrian zone), but from the rest of the hotel. The hotel is located in Taksim, which is a much more interesting place to stay in than Sultanhamet, if you're to stay fro more than 3 nights. Taksim is very lively, this is where people from Istanbul really live, and it doesn't have this Disneyland-like type of atmosphere that one can encounter in Sultanhamet. Of course, it's not \"charming\", but at least it's not fake and it has flair. It's very easy to go to Sultanhamet (where the vast majority of monuments is) with the underground funiculaire (5 minutes walking from the hotel) which brings you to the head of the new tramway line that goes to Sultanhamet.
