So I booked this at 2am in the airport hotel booking system with the intention of booking only for the night and this was the cheapest I could find that wasn't in the red light district of Geylang. PRO's: *RELATIVELY cheaper price compared to other Singapore hotels. (my booking rate was 100sgd / night) *not too far from an MRT station. *its actually not as bad as it looks from outside. CON's: *its in Little India... what can I say. It's not the best place in Singapore. *you can hear the noise outside. not good if you've traveled for more than 10 hrs, endured a stressful emergency situation until 2am and just want to sleep in peace and quiet. *Outrageous price for internet (2 sgd / 30 mins) < at a time when other hotels offer free wifi to attract guests, they are absolutely doing the opposite. It's repulsive how exhorbitant they charge. I had to go out with my laptop and look for a wifi hotspot from Wireless@SG which is a free wifi service from the SG government. *Outside appearance looks very dodgy. I was a bit scared when I first got to this hotel thinking \"oh man.... this is going to be interesting\". Luckily, the inside rooms do not look as bad as the outside. *100sgd / night for this is not really worth it. Better go find other hotels, if you can. I was only caught in an emergency moment.

The rooms were an average size. Not very spacious. We were given room on the 7th floor facing the road. For the kind of money they charge, its definitely not value for money. When all the other hotels offer free wifi in rooms, this hotel charges for it which is ridiculous. And they'll only sell 5 hour (non stop) packages. So who wants to travel to Singapore and stay holed up in the hotel for 5 hours. Why not sell hourly packages? They seem to know it yet they sell only 5 hour packages because its the attitude. Doesnt seem very smart business. The hotel seems to be managed by some very conservative people who dont give a damn about pleasing people. The attitude is \"they're tourists, they're not going to come back anyway, so why not rip them off\". They give Breakfast coupons for S$10 per room per day for the Indian restaurant next door. But the food there is so lousy that we ended up tearing the coupons and having breakfast elsewhere. The coupon system seems to be more to promote the restaurant than to serve the guests of the hotel. Overall, you get a sense that this hotel doesnt care about you as guests. They say that they have satellite tv in your room but only 4 chinese channels. The hotel seemed to be full of Indians but not a single English channel (forget regional indian channels) so whats the point?. They charge you for the extra bed, but once you put the bed, there is hardly any walking space. and they wont give you an extra blanket. The AC is so small and installed in one corner that it wont cool the room. The shower in the bathroom has been installed not keeping the guests comfort in mind but to save water. The water pressure is so low that it'd take a long time to have a bath. In the evenings, right outside the hotel on the side walk, you see prostitutes standing around waiting for customers. So not a very nice place if your're travelling with your family or children. Most of the flights come in very early in the morning. When we came to the hotel tired after the flight, the hotel doesnt even have a lobby with seats for more than 2 guests. Rest have to either stand (max standing space is 8 people) or get out. They can politely say that they'll have a room available at 11AM. But they rudely tell you \"You have to come back later, come back later\", waving their hands to say go; as if you're at some kind of a shelter or something. It puts you off immediately. We know that even this feedback will not have any impact on their attitude. This is basically intended to warn others to avoid this place. Its too expensive for the service and their attitude stinks. Everything about this hotel is to rip you off. There are better places for the price. It leaves a bitter after taste in your mouth and spoils your vacation. Because you make your first impressions about Singapore and its people from the staff at the hotel that you stay in. And this hotel is a very bad ambassador for Singapore.

The beds were comfortable and felt clean (just the carpet ) and the shower was good and basically we left the hotel at 8 in the morning and didn't return until 8 or 9 in the evenings just to sleep so it served its purpose. Cheap shopping and lots of good food. Close to Little India train station which we used every day. Tried the buses but they weren't as efficient. Staff were friendly to us but didn't give out accurate information. So do your own research and don't rely on their information cos invariably they were wrong. We nearly missed the Night S\u00e4fari due to their inaccurate information. Air conditioning worked well except for the lack of free wifi. They charged you $5 for 2 hours which was ridiculously high. Or $1 for half and hour on their computers downstairs. My teenage son and daughter were okay with this hotel.

There is also a Internet cafe below which provides browsing at an affordable cost. The last day at singapore is usually left for shopping, if this is so with you then you better stay here. There are few places around this area you can go around and try to utilize the available time.

This hotel is right opposite to the biggest shopping place in Singapore, i.e the Mustaffa centre. It is also about 5 minutes walk from the nearest metro station. I give this hotel a thumbs-up for the location and availability of good Indian food nearby. I mentioned cheap... it\u2019s one of the cheapest in Singapore, but unfortunately the cheapness translates to the place too. It\u2019s not too well maintained nor has good facilities. The reception is as cramped as it can be and the facilities in the room are not great either! But why in the remotest possibility would I spend anything more than 5-6 hours of sleep & bath in a hotel staying in awesome Singapore! It\u2019s just a place to rest (read Sleep) as soon as you get in... And wake up and leave the place as soon as you wake up! This place was best for it! It\u2019s a decent location for the cost.

From Changi Airport it takes about 20 minutes and S$ 22S to get there by taxi (incl. Night & Airport Surcharge). Since we arrived at 1am, there was no double-bed room available, although I had specificly booked one. The twin-bed room we stayed in the first night was disappointing: really old and small, with worn-out furnitures and carpets, and the bathroom facilities were in bad shape aswell. But we were offered to move to another room the next morning, which we did. The second room was quite ok, though very basicly equiped, about 12m\u00b2 in size and rather clean, as were the sheets and towels. The bathroom is small and the water is running slow, but it's still clean enough to not make you feel uncomfortable. The rooms we stayed in were quite at night, due to the fact taht they were on the backside of the hotel. The streetside rooms, however, are said to be really noisy (the receptionists were honest about that fact), so you should avoid being put in one that is facing that side. There is NO Breakfast nor any meal service; there are, however, some (Indian) restaurants next to the entrance. The hotel is located in Little India, near an area of 24h-malls and bazars, which makes the streets busy and crowded day & night, but we still felt absolutely save there all the time. By taxi it takes 5-10 minutes to the city-center, and the subway-station is about 5 minutes of walking away. All in all the Broadway Hotel is not that bad, but you should't expect too much. The rooms and the whole hotel are old and worn, truely in need of renovation and refurbishing. But the stuff seemed to be friendly and helpful during our stay, and you should ask for another room if the one you got is just too shabby. So if you just need a (rather cheep) place to sleep and shower you may find this hotel quite ok, though it truely is no place for a romantic getaway ;-).", "Date": "February 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNoisy and Basic\u201d", "Author": "Keen_Bean_Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR11538571", "Content": "I booked the Hotel Broadway at Singapore airport through the hotel booking agent, as was struggling to find anything else within budget.
