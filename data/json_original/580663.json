{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Basic, and chic would be stretch The apartment was nice enough - good size, nice stylish furnishings etc. Bed comfortable. However, little heating in the apartment -one portable radiator didn't really do the trick in the winter. Also the hot water only worked in the shower for about 5 mins making mornings a bit chilly.Hardly any toilet roll, no washing up liquid etc so as a self-catering place it wasn't that well equipped. I couldn't find the place to begin with and arrived 20mins later than I had said when I rang from the airport, the owner seemed quite stressed when I didn't think this was a massive problem. The location is a real plus, very handy for both the airport and the gothic quarter. If you are going to spend most of your time outside the apartment, then this makes for a comfortable and convenient stay.", "Date": "Dec 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR499384701", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Laura78Birmingham"}, {"Content": "Good location and facilities Was very happy with this apartment. Good location and facilities but if you have lots of luggage you do need to carry it up some fairly narrow stairs. Also if you are staying on your own (especially for females) you would need to be comfortable with the access down an alleyway, we didn't have any issues at all though.", "Date": "Jul 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR822876797", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LaurelNZ"}, {"Content": "Think long and hard before you stay here We stayed here three nights--- inside the apartment is ok for the most part --- we used our own towels because the ones provided were not really clean. The apartment itself is clean. It is fully furnished and has cutlery, iron etc. --- there is no hair dryer. It is also in a very convenient location on Estruch not too far from Plaza Catalunya - about a 5 min walk. When we arrived from the airport in the area - no taxi wanted to drop of us at the apartment - one dropped us in the area and told us to walk because there was too much traffic and the second said it was too close to drop us off!!! So be prepared to cart your luggae around and the map is difficult to read as well. We were told previously we could do early check in as our flight was getting in early in the morning but when we arrived there they said it was not possible. No doubt the location is awesome but the apartment itself is something else. There is no lift so you have to carry your luggage up the stairs. When you look outside the window --- you can see right into other peoples apartments and also have full view of their laundry hanging out to dry. Some people have their beds by the window and you can see them sleeping!!! Also, there is only hot water for 20 minutes and once it runs out you have to wait an hour for it to refill. And there is no phone so be ready for that ... to get to the apartment you have to walk through a small alley which is a bit sketchy so i wouldn't walk there alone late at night. Also, noise travels fast so don't talk too loud. I think for the same money you could and should stay somewhere else.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR867656284", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KGToronto"}, {"Content": "Great Location, perfect as a base These apartments are basic, no kettle, very small bathrooms and no veiw out of the windows.I stayed in the apartments with 4 other girls we had two apartments a one bed and a two bed, please note all the beds are double so if you dont like sharing dont book!When we arrived the taxi droped us at the top of this tiny little lane that look very dirty as we made or way down we found the door with the Chic and Basic sign above knocked on the door and there was no answer we had to call the number on the sign and a guy turned up about 20mins later with a key - he was very helpfull pointed out places on the map ect.As i said before no veiw out of the windows so you dont know what time of day it is or if it raining or not?The place overall was very clean and in a great location so if your going to be out all day making the most of Barcelona its perfect, if you like to go away and spend time in you room not the place to stay, but we all loved it", "Date": "Oct 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR484604937", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "DannielleBateman"}, {"Content": "Not as chic as we expected The appartment was not available at the time promised.
