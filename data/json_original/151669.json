First, I am deeply disappointed in saying that this hotel is a sad, sad place and an absolutely poor reflection of this extremely beautiful, charming historical town. I'm a New Yorker, but a sangerme\u00c3\u00b1a at heart. As a child, I admired the beautiful facades that line the streets of this historic town, including the Hotel Oasis. But, do not let the old world feel of this location fool you. As soon as I stepped in I was \"welcomed\" by an extremely unfriendly woman, who considered the continental breakfast to be sliced white bread, margarine and coffee. The restaurant looked deserted and not regularly used (as does the rest of the hotel, we were the only guests). I passed and headed to the room, here I was welcomed by an extremely small, stuffy room and a dried out lizard near the door. I decided to head to the (outdoor) pool, what a total disaster. Not only was it dirty and filled with leaves and dead insects, it's a pit stop for pigeons. As I laid on a beach chair, I watched two pigeons dive in and take a sip of water. I headed upstairs and what did I find? I giant roach crawling on the toilet! This was it for me, the lady downstairs didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem surprised or could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cared less that I was checking out on the same day of arrival. The money still hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been refunded. The mayor should be ashamed of himself. As I said, I'm a New Yorker and I expect these things on the subway. Not in a hotel, where a little more than three hundred dollars were spent. This place doesn't deserve a cent of the money spent at this disaster. Please, do not let this place stop you from visiting this beautiful town. Do check in at a hotel in a neighboring town and make San German one of your destinations in the west coast. It is just as beautiful as the old San Juan, rich in culture and warm residents.", "Date": "April 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIts not as bad as the reviews\u201d", "Author": "mrvelez007", "ReviewID": "UR79775889", "Content": "I stayed there for 2 nights and 3 days on a business trip and yes the building is old, but it was SUPER clean, it needs tlc as far as remodeling but the service was one on one, the manager is a great person and did his best to make my stay a welcome one, after advising about the need to remove the rugs.

I asked if there were any penalties or charges for the cancellation and the attendant said no. They still charged the room. The next month I called and asked to speak to the manager and when I started asking her about the charge she passed the telephone and I heard her say \"Oh, you deal with him\" when I asked who I was speaking to she said she was a former employee and she remembered me. After about 10 minutes of trying to reason with her, I asked to speak to the manager and she did not want to take the call, I could hear her in the background.

First, The parking is in a lot one block away very dark w/o illumination. There is no elevators. I had to carry my luggage to the second floors by the stairs without help. The room, What a room. The carpet has not been clean since the open this motel in more than 40 yrs, is so dirty that you have to use your shoes all the time. Beds are raggidy and the mattress is old and out of shape. When I went to the bathroom is so dirty the shower that I preferred to skip a bath that night. And they had the odyssey of charging 80 dollars a night for a place that not even pigs would stay. After a horrible scary night (By the way the door has the lock broken), I left the hotel in the morning and requestes to have my second night credit to my credit card, which they refused. I assumed they charge in advanced to catch a bunch of fools like me. I told that I hope with the money of the second night they could make some repairs.I called the Mayaguez Holiday INN instead, They were happy to welcome me after this trauma and the HOLIDAY INN is a Five star hotel compared with the pigstay of OASIS.
