So I feel I can give a good, balanced comparison of some options you may be cross-shopping up here for your trip. There are three resorts we have visited that all seem to target a similar market/demographic. Solage is the newest of these three, and is targeting a price-range between, say, $500-$1000 per night in individual free-standing \"studios\", with lots of nice facilities and luxury. The closest comparison is probably The Carneros Inn on the extreme opposite end of the Valley. Of the two, I think Solage is the winner. Its smaller and more intimate, and I think has the better location. Price-wise I think they tend to come out about the same. Both are clearly following the same template - modern-style construction, individual rooms, nice pool area, spa, restaurant, good service. I think Solage has the nicer spa, a few more nice service features, and a nicer little corner of the valley it occupies. From the same operator and slightly higher-cost is Calistoga Ranch. Its a true \"sister property\" located a short hop away on the same road, but the focus at Calistoga Ranch is definitely more about privacy and pleasant surroundings, and less about the restaurant, spa, or pool facilities (although it has all those things). Calistoga Ranch is a bit older property, and a bit costlier generally. For me, Calistoga Ranch is a very unique and relaxing place. The room designs are very unique with two portions of the room separated by an outdoor space, private hot-tubs, etc. And the sloped property with old growth trees, really feels like you've escaped everything. And its a smaller property which means more individual service, and more attention from the concierge. But back to Solage. Having had previous experience with Auberge properties I expected pre-visit service in the form of emails with the concierge, spa, etc. This did happen, but I waiting a bit too long (day before) to make some requests, and the concierge was not able to make everything happen as smoothly as he could have if I had perhaps given more advance notice. I can't fault him here. He WAS able to get us dinner reservations at Solbar when it was fully booked, but not at our first choice of time. The property itself was nice, very reminiscent of Carneros Inn in terms of architecture. Lots of white wood, modern lines, greenery. As with Carneros it still has a bit of a \"tract housing\" feel for me that doesn't project warmth, but its perfectly nice. They have a rather odd solution to the \"you can near your room\" issue when checking in. One of the desk staff bikes to your room and you follow in your car. Felt weird, but I can't really suggest a better way. Carneros has the same issue and just simply didn't bother. I think Solage is trying hard to meet that 5-star service level. Whenever you pass by staff on the property they say hello and greet you nicely (a very Four Seasons thing). However, I think they felt short a bit when the desk person who showed us to our room asked \"Do you want me to show you to your room\" or \"can I help you with your bags\". Its nit-picky, but I think to really hit the service level expected here they should just go ahead and do all these things and leave it to me to say no, rather than offering this as a \"yes/no\", because I think the subtext is always \"please say no\". Something for the next round of training! We booked a Suite here because it offered a private hot-tub, and I was hoping for a fair comparison to our stay at Calistoga Ranch which has a preponderance of private-spa-equipped rooms. Also we find we get good value from this in our room. The spa and suite did not disappoint. Unexpectedly instead of a typical plastic & wood \"Hot tub\" it was a full-blown in-ground spa like you'd expect in the main pool area; very nice, high marks. We used it 3-4 times in a one night stay it was so hot, clean, and relaxing. We were also pleased to find now one but TWO bottles of wine waiting on ice for us in the room, despite not ordering anything. One sparkling and one white, neither anything special but a nice touch and much preferred to a fruit place, especially in Napa. A good combination with the hot tub. Other high notes - a chance to meet & chat with their Sommelier at 3pm on Saturdays (do it, very fun) and the cocktail menu & bartenders at Sol Bar. We ate at Sol Bar and the food was good, not epic. Service was good as well. I wouldn't say the restaurant was such a highlight that I would make a trip just for that. I DO wish I had spent more time trying different cocktails at the bar and the bar food menu looked REALLY exciting, I wish I had tried more of it. The bar & restaurant and both very nice, airy, and open and a pleasant place to hang out. Even if you're not staying here, I think its worth a visit if you're at the north end of the valley. The Spa was nice, definitely a step above most resort spas in this area. Huge hot mineral water pool, great cabanas (limited number!). Any guest can use the spa facilities including the hot springs pool, which is comparable in size and much nicer than the \"official\" pool outside Sol Bar. There's a kids pool as well, which ironically is much smaller than, but much more heavily used than, the main pool. But either way, all the pools are nice, big, and well maintained. The scenery here is good, not epic. Its in a nice narrow part of the valley so you have mountain views in any direction, but the resort itself doesn't have any elevation, so you don't get those great wide vistas you might get further up the slopes at like Calisoga Ranch or Auberge de Soleil. So bottom line - which to choose next time? If you are looking to relax and be a bit anti-social, there is nothing like Calisotga Ranch. It feels very luxe, private, and relaxing. If you want a bit more activity, I would go with Solage over Carneros Inn. The service level feels a notch higher, the property is smaller and more private, and the facilities are all top-notch. They also retained a lot of the amenities from Calistoga Ranch like free use of Mercedes Cars, the bikes, and generally excellent concierge service. I still want to check out Meadowood and Auberge (the original property from this operator).", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Granite Bay, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Getaway\u201d", "Author": "CA_Vacationer", "ReviewID": "UR128027387", "Content": "We have been here a few times while attending a conference for my husband's company.

If I were the owner, I'd insist the manager be all over the place. As noted, I've been at Solage a lot, and made an effort to seek out someone who looked like management. But never saw anyone like that. I'd hire a landscape architect to dress up the place a bit. This may seem odd, but the place needs some mature trees. There really is no lobby, so it seems a little cold; that is, nowhere to get the feel of the place. It looks sterile but professional. Concrete floors. I'd also bring in some employee training on being warm and unpretentious. Avoid room 7 if you want privacy. Positives? I've had some excellent meals there. \"Locals night\" around the fire pit is great for conversations. Beds are heavenly. Decks are relaxing. Some employees do try hard to please.

If it was good I would not mind paying the prices, but when you pay that much for breakfast it better be good. We canceled our dinner reservations that day to Sol Bar and went to Jo Le instead and were very happy that we did that. We needed to get out of that hotel.

As usual, I spent too much time focusing on the not so good comments on TA before we went. I can say that our own personal experience was great though. It is for sure not cheap, but you also get what you pay for I guess. I was a little disappointed when we first got there to see we were at the \"back of the lot\", but as I was checking in, there was a rather loud wedding going on (to be expected), and we were more than happy to get something that was peaceful and quiet. The distance was no problem, and was only a short walk, or literally 30 seconds on the bikes provided for each cabin. The restaurant was nice, but again pricey. I would say it's a nice place to start your day with breakfast, but there are so many choices in Calistoga (5 minute bike ride) that I would probably choose to dine in town. Some people commented on it being a long way from Napa, but if you have a car, it's not a big deal. I would say that the area around Calistoga is as nice or nicer than Napa. Has lots of great wineries, and is just as scenic. My wife had a spa treatment and said she had a great time (she's been to many so she would know) The room itself was different, but very nice. Not huge, but cozy with great beds and pillows. Love the loose coffee and filters, and selection of teas, including a \"sleepy time\" tea that put me out every night. the bathroom space was nice with some of the best smelling toiletries i've had in a hotel. My wife HAD to buy some at the spa before we left. The cement floors in the rooms can be a little cool, but slippers are provided. The rainfall shower was great, although it never seemed to get quite hot enough for us. Just one last comment that I have to mention pertaining to what others were saying about the grounds and landscaping at Solage. It is not \"undone\" but rather planted to fit in with the natural surroundings. I'm not sure f people wanted to see all grass, but I thought they were beautiful with cacti and lavender. it in perfectly, and smelled great.

We had a Vega Studio, which was plenty big, with a king bed, seating area, covered patio, and a large bathroom. Loved having the two cruiser bikes for our own personal use; we rode all over the resort with them. The room is contemporary Cali style, with an uncluttered, clean feel, soothing colors and textures, and high-end amenities--from the fluffy robes, towels, and slippers, to the toiletries, to the custom lighting settings, and extremely comfortable bed with crisp white linens. Wi-Fi was excellent. The room was quiet, private, and just oozed mellow. We dined at Solbar several times; our package included daily breakfast and one full dinner. The food was sublimely Napa-esque: fresh and high-quality ingredients, absolutely delicious, and beautifully prepared. Like all excellent places in Napa Valley, they had a fabulous selection of wines and cocktails. Don't miss the made-to-order donut holes and dipping sauces, or the seared scallops, the beet salad, the wagyu beef...I could go on and on! We ate at the bar, inside, and on the patio--each one a lovely experience. We used the fitness room a couple of times, as well as the two different pool areas--very nice.

The entire time we were there, it was like the entire staff knew this and went out of their way to make our occasion even more special.

None of the cottage windows face that way, but it's a reminder that Calistoga is a functional little town and Solage is not a secluded retreat. But everything else was pretty darned wonderful. Some highlights: * Mudslide treatment for two, at the spa, was really fun, and a relative bargain for the amount of playful couples relaxation. It's nothing like the sulfurous-smelling mud bath treatments that the traditional -- OK, California Hippie -- spas in the area are known for. Linger at the pool afterwards. * Taking the cottage bikes for a jaunt into town. * Joyriding in the house Mercedes E550 coupe. If you see the silver cars out front, ask at the front desk about the free demo drive program. * SolBar restaurant. More comments over there. * And obviously the very nice, very private rooms.

You get a pretty small bucket of mud. Maybe 20oz of mud to rub over yourself as you are left alone in the hot room. The staff will knock in 20mins to alert you to shower off. the next 20mins you are in the mineral water, more like a hot bath with some salts and oils to get the body sweating out the toxins. Last 2 mins are spent in an antigravity chair, more sweating. Overall, very relaxing. The last step seemed a bit short and I would think another 10-20mins in the chair would have been nice. After that, you are at liberty to use the hot tubs (more like pools). The main tub is in the 90s and about 15x40 feet. The 2 single sex clothing optional hot tubs are 8 x 30 approx. So they are big hot tubs. Each single sex area has a cold pool and a steam room. Steam room was very hot and very good! Loved it. The area is very quiet and relaxing.

Couldn't have asked for more.\u201d", "Author": "debreem", "ReviewID": "UR122528158", "Content": "In full disclosure for this review, we are still at the Solage about 3/4 through our stay. I have been so impressed with the service and our stay that I figured I should write this post while it is still fresh! We are staying a total of 6 days at the Solage over the new year holiday and into the first week of January and our experience here has been nothing short of fantastic. We are staying in a Vega studio just behind the gym and spa buildings with views of the mountains. The Vega studio is a great space. The layout is fantastic, with a somewhat minimalist and comfortable design. The shower has great pressure and the stone floor in the shower is amazing. The mini-bar area is stocked with complimentary coffee and creamer, from a local roaster. There is free wifi, a flatscreen, and a great outdoor patio with seating. The entire grounds have been laid out and designed to feel even bigger than they actually are. The fresh, clean look of the buildings combined with the barn like feel creates a perfectly relaxing atmosphere. The hot pools, especially since it is January here, are fantastic and while we haven't made use of the main pool or bocce ball courts, they are well kept and we have seen many people using them. The best part of our stay, however, has been the personal touches. The staff is welcoming and friendly. We checked in on New Years Eve and decided to eat at the Sol Bar. Just before our meal, a staff person dropped off a \"hangover kit\" at our room in a cute little bag filled with gatorade, water, advil, etc. A very nice touch! We had a very good meal. The wine pairings were great, in particular, we had two really nice pairings of Stoney Hill Chardonnay with a scallops dish and Heitz Cabernet Sauvignon with a kobe beef dish. Our server was incredibly accomodating and allowed what would have been a four course sharing into an 8 course sharing. The ambiance is gorgeous inside. The bar area is also a good size and the mixed drinks are supposed to be very good. After dinner, we came back to a bottle of champagne and some food in our room, a total surprise from the Solage. They also deliver fresh mint water at night in great little milk jars and lay out a thought of the day on your bed. Last but not least, the spa and gym. My boyfriend and I have both used the gym facility every day so far. It is small but completely adequate. Clean, well kept, new machines. The treadmills and ellipticals have t.v.'s attached and there is a good size free weights area. They offer daily classes in a studio area next door though neither of us have taken them. My boyfriend got a massage at the spa and it lived up to all the hype. The spa facilities are fantastic. It is calm and serene. The locker rooms are sizable and there are also phenomenal steam rooms for both men and women. The only possible downside is that it is in Calistoga, tucked a bit away. But it is located right on the Silverado Trail which is gorgeous and we have loved being just a bit outside the rush and main mix. It is a quick 15-20 minute drive to St. Helena, easy to get to Healdsburg and the drive down Silverado to Rutherford, Yountville, Napa, etc is 30-45 minutes depending where you are headed. We haven't minded the location at all but could understand how others might want to be closer to St. Helena or elsewhere. I am sure I am forgetting some of the details of our stay but we cannot recommend the Solage enough. As one last aside, it looks like the management did respond to past comments and there are now ipod docking stations in all of the rooms, a very nice touch!

We had dinner reservations one evening at 9:00 pm and had to wait over 40 minutes for our table. Since we were eating so late, we were really hungry. At a minimum, I would have expected them to give us a drink or appetizer. Another day, we ate at the restaurant for lunch. We got there about 10 minutes before they opened, but we were told to wait on the patio and that they would seat us once they were open. We sat out front waiting (there were not many guests around) and no one came to seat us even after they were open. We had to go up and ask.

Well they are happy in their jobs so that is a positive thing! I was sorry to leave and I would definitely go back if I am in the area again.

The resort was crowded during our first on-season visit and much less serene. Solage attracts a young crowd, which can occasionally get noisier than the more typical middle aged resort demographic. However, the units are spread out, and it's very peaceful in the rooms and their patios. The outdoor hot tub in our suite was a plus. Free (inclusive) wet bar was a special treat, but I don't think this applies to all rooms. Service is generally attentive, rooms are clean, and spa treatments were good to great. However, the bus boy who showed us to our rooms via bicycle, seemed to be going through the motions when describing our room amenities - perhaps because we were returning guests. Our dinner at SolBar during our second visit last year was good, though the menu tries a bit too hard to be eclectic and exotic (pork belly, etc.) - not that we haven't been exposed to various cuisines before. During our latest trip, for lack of ANY traditional offerings at SolBar, we took room service - simple burgers and fries - and it's probably the first time I've had room service fries that were crisp and not soggy upon delivery. The gym is decent sized, with maybe 10 aerobic stations w/ TV's and a good selection of weight stations. There appeared to be an active series of exercise classes as well.

The B winery is across the street which makes getting there from the hotel very easy. Unfortunately, most of the other decent wineries are a bit of a drive, so it was nice to be able to walk to this one from the hotel. I have only great things to say about the place, if I were trying to find something negative, I would say the room that comes with the fireplace and soaking tub were a bit of a disappointment. The fireplace is ok, the only time you can see it is if you are sitting in a chair directly in front of it, it would be nice if you could lie on the bed and be able to see it too.

It was every bit as good as we remembered it from the first time. I think the most useful thing for other TA users I can say about Solage is that whilst its not cheap (where in the Napa Valley is?), it does represent value for the money it costs compared to other Napa Valley resorts. The spa facilities, rooms and restaurant are all first class. The beds are really comfortable, and the resort is so quiet at night that you can't fail to get a good nights sleep. The service is truly excellent and attentive, without being intrusive. The concierge is knowledgable and efficient. They even loan Mercedes Benz cars to guests for free - we borrowed a convertible for cruising around the vineyards with the top down which was a lot of fun. Our only gripe about Solage is that it's so good, you don't really want to leave and go off wine tasting, or to experience the Napa Valley. You could easily spend your whole time on the property, using the pools, the spa, relaxing and eating at the excellent SolBar. But then you pay the high prices because you're in the Napa Valley, and not experiencing what the area has to offer would be a bit of a waste, so it becomes a bit of a balancing act to get the best of both worlds. Tip 1: Book the B&B rate if it's offered for the dates you're there. The breakfast at SolBar is worth it on its own, but the rate also includes use of the thermal pools too. Tip 2: The rooms are comfortable, and spacious, but the various room types are all exactly the same size, they mostly all have the same king beds (though there are some with 2 queens), same outdoor patio areas, they are all well spread out away from other guests and peacefully secluded, and all have identical amenities. The differences are that the least expensive Vega studio doesn't have a bath or fire in the room - so is actually the most spacious as a result; the next priced room, the Mira studio has a fire; and the most expensive Adara studio has both a fire and bath (there are also some suites which are the only larger room type).

This being a family vacation meant that total self-indulgence was out and family together time was the order of the day. And with an 8 year old in tow, there were definitely other considerations as well. My worry was that the place would be too high end for the type of relaxing casual family escape we were looking for, but a friend of mine who had been there before assured me otherwise. The first good vibe was the conversation I had with the lady assisting with the spa reservations. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that curt used to catering to elites only type demeanor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she was very nice and patient with my questions. So I was at least able to book my 50 minutes of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time : ) From the moment we arrived, everyone from the front desk to the rest of the staff was very welcoming. My daughter was zipping a refreshing drink when I walked back to the car from check in, and the gentleman who brought our luggage in was quite easy going which quickly put us at ease. We had the opportunity to stay at the Capella suite for our one night stay in Calistoga and upon first inspection, the furnishings and the layout was definitely to our taste. The place actually felt like home but with the upgrades my husband and I had been talking about undertaking in our own home -the spa outside, the stream shower and other nice touches here and there. Our suite had a private back patio with a hot tub with the soothing sound of the fountain lulling us further to bliss. There were just numerous nooks and crannies that begged to be discovered and enjoyed inside and outside our quarters. The ground\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s landscaping and structures blended harmoniously in a very low key fashion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was a very restful sight that was a prelude to de-cluttering the mind and leaving behind all your woes and work stressors. The two bicycles by the door were among the touches that underscored eco consciousness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c back to nature and simple times. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect this treat but we were given a welcome wine bottle and cheese plate which we availed of outside the patio \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yum! Shortly after, the kiddo was eager to swim after playing planes, trains and automobiles for over 7 hours. On the way to the pool, my husband and daughter played one round of bocce which my daughter actually won since she had a softer touch - hehe. We then went swimming in the children area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they had a few floaties lying around and my daughter had fun stacking them and pretending she was in a sea plane rescuing other shipwrecked floaties - and here I thought she was tired of traveling. My husband and I swam and lounged enjoying the wonderfully cool weather \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we came from Austin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 96 to 106 degree heat blast. The lady who took care of our drinks was prompt and attentive though we really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay too long as it was starting to get late. We did have a chance to walk around the premises \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that in itself was pretty relaxing as well. A few couples riding their bikes passed us by. Back in our unit, we soaked for about half an hour in the spa and tried the steam shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very soothing with the pebbles massaging the soles of our feet. The turn down service was great as well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next thing we knew the sofa was turned into a bed with our child snugly tucked in watching TV, the fireplace was burning and life was good. And the robes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WOW it was like being cocooned in pillows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c soo soft and heavenly. Hubby was so nice to give his up to my daughter and she wore hers the entire night and walked around like a snow empress. We would have loved to have made reservations at the Solbar but we instead decided to venture out for meals as we liked walking around town and sampling local eateries and pubs. Had a very pleasant meal at the Hydro Grill and enjoyed the local brew. I tried the pomegranate beer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that was pleasantly refreshing and my husband like his beer as well. The food was also very good. The place we had breakfast at the following day was not very memorable. I did get my hour and a half of self-pampering at the spa where I had ample time to check in, unwind in the steam room and mineral pool before and after my 50 minute shiatsu and Swedish massage. I had scheduled it an hour before our check out from the resort. That experience, though short-lived, would be my personal favorite. My \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCalgon take me away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my therapist was really great and I must have been reduced to melted goo on that massage table as I had a hard time peeling myself off - I wished for time to just stand still. Checkout was fast, hassle free. On our way out we saw a riotous color of Lambourginis neatly parked in a row at the lot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that every day! Overall, the stay just felt so short - Solage really should be enjoyed at a more leisurely pace, two or more nights would be preferable especially for first timers to the Calistoga area. I wished to avail more of the spa services, the highly rated Solbar and ventured to some of the local wineries but alas we had a long travel to Monterey for our next destination.

If you're a swimmer, you're gonna love it. 40 meters in length. Unbelievable! Almost double the length of a standard Olympic sized-pool. Not too heavy on the chlorine, either. Lap swimming at it's finest! And they have a separate kiddie pool. So, no screaming kids or leaking diapers in the water. :) Ditto for the gym. Nice facility with quality equipment. And an incentive to work off all the wine and dinners... The spa is beautifully designed. Serene. Did the couples mud slide and it was a trip! Not a standard mud bath at all. Blissed out to the max. Only gripe: had read complaints about the landscaping and thought, someone's being a persnickety ----, but I have to agree. Our patio had no privacy and looked out on to dried-out mulch with minimal, small plantings. I don't think this is a case of waiting for maturing growth. It'll still be sparse. In this verdant valley? Add some plantings to form a hedge around the outdoor spaces (some units have that, but not many). Also, we were there Tues. - Fri., it was definitely not full capacity, and mellow just the way I like it. Wonder what the place would be like if it were totally booked... But, we'll definitely return to find out. Final note: if you arrive late like we did and head into Calistoga expecting to get some dinner, every place will be closed around nine on a Tuesday night. Didn't help that Solage stops room service at nine, as well. Almost knocked off a star for the limited room service hours and landscaping, but it's rare for me to leave a hotel feeling so satisfied, I couldn't.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful elegant retreat\u201d", "Author": "WPS-76", "ReviewID": "UR73769546", "Content": "We recently spent two nights at Solage in Calistoga. I took advantage of an online deal -- $350/night for a Vega king studio, including breakfast for two each morning. I highly recommend this hotel for a relaxing weekend get-away. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable: the front desk had fresh mint lemonade for us on arrival; we were shown to our room by a bellboy who walked us through the room's amenities; we used the concierge to book several wine tastings (do not miss Larkmead or Schramsberg!). Our room was fantastic - very modern, super comfortable bed, huge pebble-floor shower, iPod dock that played our music on our semi-private patio. And despite the July heat, we did use the bikes to visit two nearby wineries! Small details like the fresh minted water with turn down service were very nice. We also spent a few hours each day at the pool which was relaxing and fun -- it has a bit of a Miami feel to it with entertaining people-watching and great drinks -- but still quiet and relaxing. I spent one morning at the spa -- loved the Mudslide! Highly recommend it. I wish I had realized I would be applying the mud myself (you can ask for help) b/c I would have made my boyfriend come along also for a couples one. After the mud, you soak in a bath of Calistoga mineral water for 20 minutes, then a \"relaxation\" chair for 20 minutes. I could have skipped the chair... In addition to two breakfasts at Solbar (not for those without an appetite!), we had dinner one night at Solbar. The food, the patio, the wine, the service -- everything was excellent. I would definitely recommend Solage to someone who is hoping to avoid the Disneyland-feel of Napa. There are many fantastic wineries (Larkmead, August Briggs, Twomey, Clos Pegase) within a few minutes that are far less crowded and serve great wine.

We took the retro bikes 1/4 mile away and did a hike for an hour up a local peak -- Oat Creek Preserve or something like that. It was wonderful and so close! We ate breakfast both days at Solbar. The food was creative and very yummy. They were more than willing to split our breakfast entrees and our fruit plate was bursting with local berries and all sorts of things. As we drove up we were able to work with Jason, the concierge, to book appointments at local wineries at the last minute. Jason was awesome and guided us to some great tours and got tasting fees waived at some places too. Very nice. Our only glitch was that there's only Jason and he can only work 5 days a week. Not sure why they don't have a backup but he sure is AWESOME! We also at at JoLi and Barolo in town. Totally fantastic meal at JoLe!! Barolo was enjoyable but if you only have one place to eat, do JoLe but you must have reservations! On reading the recent (and only) bad review on Solage I really don't understand what the person was talking about. The hotel is eco-friendly with drought tolerant grasses all over the property. I didn't notice any dead plants and there were workers replanting a tree but that's all we saw. Our room was very quiet as was the neighborhood in general. Maybe asking for a room at the back of the property would have worked for them but, who knows. We did use the fitness center and I took a pilates class the last stay. The facility is wonderful. If you are interested in their classes call ahead to check the schedule. We booked a wine tour that conflicted with a free pilates reformer class that I would have liked to take.

Before we took this journey we began our research under a general sense of wanting to visit the CA wine country, including Napa and Sonoma. As we dug deeper into hotels, wine tours, and other options, Calistoga became the obvious destination, and the Solage Calistoga Resort was clearly our best choice of hotels. We were looking for accommodations on the higher end of the luxury spectrum, conveniently situated near the wineries we wanted to visit, within walking distance of nearby a town, and potentially a spa. We reviewed and called the following hotels in the area: 1. Heraldsburg Hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c http://www.hotelhealdsburg.com/ 2. El Dorado Hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c http://www.eldoradosonoma.com/el_dorado_hotel.html/ 3. Solage Calistoga \u00e2\u20ac\u201c http://www.solagecalistoga.com/ 4. Harvest Inn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c http://www.harvestinn.com/ All these properties had unique aspects, such as being in a downtown area, acceptable rates (around $195), and well-reviewed. Nonetheless, most didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the room configuration or availability for the dates we were interested in (apparently, April/May is a popular time for weddings in this part of CA). In the end, Solage was the only hotel that was able to accommodate our needs. The hotel reviewed well on TripAdvisor and other travel sites, but what really impressed me was the reservation process. I spoke with a wonderful reservation specialist, Hallie Spahr (hspahr@solagecalistoga.com), who was incredibly patient while she took care to understand the nature of our trip, identify the exact experience we were looking for, and discuss in great depth the location of the hotel (Northern Napa). Hallie made sure to point out special attributes of Solage such as their Michelin-starred restaurant, and the fact that their spa is rated #1 America and Caribbean and #10 in the World by Conde Nast; it is also rated the #2 Spa Resort and #11 Resort U.S. and Canada by Travel + Leisure Magazine. I was impressed that Hallie wanted to know if we were celebrating anything special and what our arrival time may be, so that she could secure dinner reservations for our first night to ensure we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go hungry on arrival! I was very impressed with her professionalism at the booking, and again later with her correspondence regarding any further questions we had. We flew into San Francisco around 9pm, and the night-time drive to Calistoga took about 2 hours, as there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much traffic. When we arrived around 11pm, Kevin at the front desk was more than friendly and welcoming, ensuring we felt very well taken care of. Due to our flight delays, we unfortunately missed our dinner reservation; upon seeing our disappointment, Kevin rushed over to the bar to get us a bottle of wine right before it closed. After a long journey, we were enormously grateful to Kevin! Our room was spectacular. We stayed in the Atlas Studio which was absolutely wonderful with breathtaking views of the pool while being very close to the restaurant. The room was immaculate, very well appointed in a modern yet comfortable style, with a definite luxurious feel. We were very happy to rest comfortably in feathery down beds. Some of the best features of our room were: 1. We really liked the eco-friendly approach of refilling Solage glass water bottles instead of supplying daily plastic water bottles. The mint leaves in our water were very refreshing and provided a nice touch. 2. Along the same eco-friendly note, we appreciated the large containers of shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner instead of the traditional small, plastic, single use containers. 3. The bathrobes were simply heavenly!! After traveling around the world and experiencing some very lovely bathrobes, I can easily say these were by far the most luxurious, thick, soft, enveloping bathrobes I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever experienced. Just putting them on and sitting on our patio made us feel restored. 4. Kudos to the housekeeping staff for always keeping our room exceptionally clean and welcoming. Great job! We spent our next 2 days we wine tasting and touring vineyards. I will go into details of those visits in my next column. For now, let me just say we had a great time and enjoyed the opportunity to experience a variety of winemaking styles, grapes, and individuals at each location. Each morning before our wine tasting tours, we had a delicious breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Each server was exceptionally knowledgeable and friendly, but Raul earns my highest praise for his attentiveness to our dining experience. Still, thanks should go to all the restaurant crew for their great job. Solage has a beautiful pool and we chose to sit by it couple of times to enjoy the view while we collected and recounted our memories of the day. We did have a disappointment during one of these visits when we ordered a drink, then were unable to get the waitress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention and finally had to settle our bill directly with the bartender. While we certainly felt that flat 20% gratuity added by Solage was unjustified for such exceptionally unreliable service, we chose not to focus on the negative but instead on the continued enjoyment of the trip. Sadly this was not to be, as a few minutes after we returned to the room, we got a call from our waitress asking why we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay her and why we left the pool without settling the bill! After far too much dialog explaining that due to her lack of attentiveness to her job we had to settle it at the pool bar (along with the fact that her colleagues should have communicated this to her), she eventually released us from the conversation of mistrust and mutual embarrassment. On our final day, we made spa appointments, as we simply had to experience the award-winning spa at Solage. We had 1 body massage and a combination of a facial and a foot massage. The spa facility is very nice, open with beautiful grounds that are separate enough from the main hotel/pool area for some peace and quiet. While the check in process was unusually fast for a spa, we were able to get into the more relaxed mood once in the waiting area. The therapists were wonderful. Both were very calm, kind, and expert in their respective areas. The Calistoga area is known for their mineral water (there is actually a water bottling facility down the road) and the spa offers clothing optional men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mineral water, hot and cold pools, and a co-ed pool in the spa area. While smaller than expected, I really liked the mineral water pools. The co-ed spa pool was also very pleasant, and the grounds well envisioned and maintained. The only issue we experienced was when ordering poolside drinks (again!) with a snack. For clarity, the spa pool is only available to spa guests, meaning if you are having a spa treatment you are welcome to enjoy the pool before or after your appointment. Of course, in this case you are in your bathrobe or swimsuit either awaiting or following your spa treatment and generally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any valuables on you, just the locker key where all your belongings remain. As such, I was surprised when we were asked to provide a room number or a credit card in order to place our poolside order. We explained that we had just checked out a couple of hours ago, so no room number was available, but of course all of our credit card information was on file and easily accessible. After much discussion of how to retrieve this information, we were told that we simply must provide a credit card if we wanted to be served. You can imagine how aggravating and disappointing it is to be reduced to a conversation of having to go back to the locker to immediately pay a $30 bill after we just spent over $2,000 on the visit! The pool restaurant attendant explained how there is nothing she can do as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would not let her enter our order and how this is the process\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6on, on and on. While I understand systems and processes, this is not acceptable for a hotel that charges $500+ night, nor should it be my problem or concern how Solage systems or processes work. I am a guest, attempting to enjoy the spa pool after my spa treatments, and for the type of luxury establishment Solage attempts to be, I expect the back-office challenges to be solved without my involvement. In light of two disappointing pool experiences, Solage should definitely provide better training to their pool staff and empower them to make decisions that satisfy basic guest expectations of the caliber Solage aspires to be. All in all, other than a few poorly trained pool staff, the hotel was enjoyable. We loved the room, the mineral pools, and the restaurant experience. Still, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure I would return without some assurance that the few hassles we experienced would not be repeated. This is a growing opportunity for Solage to improve this one aspect of their business, and I certainly welcome any comments from its management as to steps that are being put in place to address this. Once that happens, I would absolutely be comfortable returning and recommending Solage to my faithful readers. http://www.travelupgradeguide.com/calistoga-ca.html", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakeport, California", "Title": "\u201cfalse promotion for $100 resort coupon.\u201d", "Author": "happywanderer060", "ReviewID": "UR64845951", "Content": "I stayed at the solage hotel last year when seeking a membership in their Spa.

Visited Solage for the first time, and tried the Mud bath treatment. This was different than the traditional \"plunge\" treatments where you sit in whole mess of mud and more is packed on top of you. You begin your experience by saddling up to the Mud Bar and selecting your scent of choice. Your bartender then mixes your mud and hands it to you in a little pail. You will then be led to your mud huts, where you can apply and bake. (If visiting as a couple, make sure to request a couple's hut...no extra charge.) After you bake (the mud begins to harden) you'll be notified that it is time to shower off. Once you get all of the mud off (takes a while) you'll be led to your soak tub, full of mineral water.

I was SO lucky...I had this entire area to myself!! The hot mineral pool was SO relaxing, as was the eucalyptus steam room- it was VERY hot and smelled so great! The cold plunge was refreshing, as was the al fresco shower (complete with body wash and shampoo and conditioner). I spent about an hour out there.. it was chilly, but it didn't matter at all!!

For example we asked the concierge to make reservations at several restaurants and wineries upon check in but we had to remind them the next morning to do so. In one particular instance, concierge had told us we did not need to make reservations for lunch, but we were turned away upon arrival at the restaurant since it was completely fully booked. Rooms: Rooms are a bit dark because of the minimal motif and dark cement floor design. Maid Service: Overall the rooms were tidy and well maid; however, on one day housekeeping disregarded the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on our door, and entered to clean it while we were having breakfast. We had put the sign on the door because we did not pack up all our belongings before leaving the room that day. Overall: Overall we had a good stay, but for the price, I would probably stay elsewhere next time.

They also allow dogs, we brought our two little Chihuahuas and they loved it. So nice to go on vacation and not have to leave them behind! I am a total purist when it comes to bath products, and Solage actually has really pure bath products in the rooms made by Sumbody - a great company. I travel a lot and can not think of a single time when I have ever used the products in hotel rooms because most are full of chemicals and preservatives. I always bring my own. I was so pleasantly surprised and to be honest a little shocked when I saw that they are using \"Sumbody\" products in the rooms and they really are actually all natural and pure. I am so impressed by the \"little things\" and Solage doesn't' miss a beat on those great little extravagant details. The spa also has an organic all natural line of facial products called Eminence, my absolute favorite skin care line ever. I usually don't get facials at resorts because most have products that are full of chemicals. Solage is definitely the most eco-frinedly resort I have been too. They have countless green aspects, one of my favorites was that instead of bringing plastic bottles of water to your room at night, they leave you a complimentary beautiful reusable glass bottle of filtered water with a beautiful sprig of mint in it for turn down service. Great touch, and I highly commend them for doing away with the plastic bottles, what a great idea. First resort I have stayed at that does this. That alone makes me want to go back. Had two fabulous massages while I was there at the spa and we also did the couples mud slide experience, which I highly recommend. Pure heaven. Just writing about it makes me want to go back. I have stayed at a lot of different places in Napa/ Sonoma/ Calistoga/ Wine Country and Solage (and Calistoga Ranch) are my two favorites, hands down.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Value": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "santa monica", "Title": "\u201cThe Perfect Choice\u201d", "Author": "ilove2travel03", "ReviewID": "UR33739882", "Content": "My friend and I went to Napa for a few days and stayed at Solage Calistoga.

The rooms are modern and up-to-date with all of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comforts such as a plasma TV, pebbled floor shower, wireless internet, private patio and last but not least, a very comfortable bed. Make sure you take the two included cruiser bikes into town! If you have a stay on a warm weekend, you may never leave the poolside where you can enjoy drinks and food from Solbar. The gym enthusiasts certainly won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be disappointed and the bride had a very relaxing morning on her wedding day at the spa. We have seen some reviews about the landscaping. First, the place is barely over a year old so keep in mind that the trees/shrubs need time. Solage is eco-friendly and they kept the landscaping design in mind when determining water/resource requirements to keep the place going. In fact, many of the employees bike to work or carpool to be more \"green.\" In our opinion, the property is gorgeous and will only get better with time. In fact, there have been some new landscaping projects since our April wedding. We were so impressed we joined Club Solage and our fondness of the place continues to grow.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "58halloween", "ReviewID": "UR19857319", "Content": "We recently stayed at Solage in Calistoga.

It's almost there, but not quite. I'm reluctant to be at all negative because I had such a relaxing and enjoyable time. When you visit I think you'll see what I mean. Unlike some five star resorts this property -- perhaps because of the informality of California and the surrounding rustic ranch-like country -- is quite relaxing from the moment you drive up. It doesn't take time to unwind. I guess that someone would say the karma is good at this place. There is this wonderful setting and the quiet of the Silverado Trail backcountry. At any rate the location is superb. The main dining room has one of the most beautiful views of the mountains through a huge, two or three story window. Outdoor dining with a fire on top of a rectangular fountain is superb. The sommelier is knowledgeable and helpful with the wine selections and the concierges on which wineries to visit down the road (Joseph Phelps, Clos Pegase, etc.) if you don't have a week to visit all of the usual suspects in Napa, St. Helena and Rutherford. Architecture at Solage is simple yet extremely well-designed (contemporary) one-storey buildings with vaulting ceilings and the lastest electronics. A rather fun coffee maker. The rooms are individual houses with open rooms and private cabanas set up with exterior sofas for a drink or meals. There are bikes outside each concrete-floored cabin to get around the property or ride into nearby Calistoga. (Try Sarafornia if you want a great breakfast or lunch outside the spa menu and prices.) I found the staff quite helpful. I'd give them a top rating. From making airline bookings at midnight to information on geology, history and wines, they know a great deal.

The resort is very new and as some of the reviews say you can see that it will really come into it's own when the planting develops but it's still very pretty. Everyone gets their own little cottage - ours comprised of a large bedroom/livingroom with two double beds and a very large shower room. The whole resort has a very contemporary feel to it. Outside your cottage you each get a nice seating area and a couple of bikes - it took me a while to get on mine but they're great fun and really safe. It's the only place in America where I've seen cycle lanes so worth getting out and about. The pool is amazing - a proper sports pool where you could do length after length and loads of loungers/umbrellas. The staff are really attentive and come round all the time with water/drinks etc. The restaurant/bar is set near the pool with a large comfy area to sit outside - most people take breakfast here. My only complaint would be how limited the menus were and they didn't change all week. The staff were very helpful (though sometimes overwhelmed at breakfast). The concierge was great at making bookings at the vineyards and reastaurants for us. The spa looks great but I found the choices fairly boring and I wasn't that impressed with my facial (this was part of a treatment which included a wrap and massage - had to move from the facial room to the massage room which was a bit of pain) and my mini pedicure was poor. OK but I've had better. The gym was well equipped and light and airy which was nice but pretty crammed. Eg if you like doing floor work wasn't much room cos of all the machines. They have a studio and I got to try the pilates machines but they only had 2/3 classes over the whole week. The resort is about a 10 minute walk from Calistoga which is a cute old town with a few nice shops and restaurants - but don't expect much night life. We pretty much went to out to other places in the evening as the area has so many great restaurants on offer.

Please improve the service at this hotel. The hotel is a diamond in the rough and has many favorable attributes. It is in a superb location, the design is excellent, and the food is quote good; however, the service is mediocre at best and significantly detracts from the guest experience. We are blessed to have travelled extensively and have stayed in numerous \"luxury\" hotels (including several Auberge Group hotels). We presume that many if not all of the guests at Solage have experienced other \"luxury\" hotels and know first hand the type of service that should accompany a $500/minumum per night room rate. We ask the hotel management to explain the following: 1. Why didn't you mow the waist high weeds that fronted the patio to our room (or at least install a screen if you were unable to mow them)? 2. Why did the restaurant \"run out\" of black tea on a weekend? Why couldn't someone from the hotel quickly run to Cala Food in Calistoga and purchase a box of Lipton for the enjoyment of guests who wanted a cup of tea for breakfast on a Sunday morning (desperate measures for desperate times). 3. Why was our salt grinder filled with pepper in the restaurant? I could go on, but I think the above is illustrative of the issues that plague this hotel. Yes, its the little things that keep guests coming back. We own property in Calistoga and welcome with open arms a \"luxury\" hotel, but reputations and return guests must be earned. Solage Calistoga continues to provide \"uneven\" service even 1 year after its opening. This is a shame as much of the staff provide good-excellent service, but the careless or poorly trained staff are ruining it for everyone else.

The two turndown services are a nice compliment but certainly do not merit the overpriced studio rates.

The cottages, which are smaller than a standard size hotel room, are craftsman style on the outside and ultra modern inside, making for an odd mix of architecture. Cold unheated cement floors wake you up quickly on a cold Napa morning, and the three-quarter high wall separating the bedroom from the bathroom doesn't work well for couples who wake at different times or like their privacy. Our unit offered no privacy from other units, although others had fenced in patios. Our view was the back of another cottage and we had one of the nicer units.

The pebble shower was fantastic, and the sink/bathroom areas were simple and clean. Bed was comfy, breakfast at their restaurant was good, and the staff was friendly.

Mud baking was just ok, but I enjoyed the soak and the chair. When I return, I'll opt for a bigger unit next time, mostly because of the fact the bed sits several feet from both the main door and the sliding glass door.

I have traveled all over the world, and I have to say this was the best hotel/vacation I have ever experienced. I was persuaded to book at this hotel because of its association to Auberge Resort, the perennial Napa luxury boutique hotel, but without the price tag and over-the-top service (I prefer a casual and unpretentious resort). Solage Calistoga did not disappoint. From the minute my sister and I arrived there we both fell in love with the resort. I spoke with Richard Hill, the general manger, before I arrived about some special touches I wanted my sister to receive: flowers and great seating for dinner at Solbar (the ultra cool, ultra hip on-property eatery). In fact, Mr. Hill knocked on our door 20 minutes after arrival with a complimentary glass of champagne for my sister and me.

The rooms are a cross between a loft apartment in the city (with free-standing walls) and a wonderful B& B room. Our room had an amazing tub and shower, refrigerator (that was not exposed) and an Ipod docking station. The amenities at this property are insane: the pool scene is as if you were in Miami and the spa services are as good (if not better) as Solage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother ship, Auberge, and the gym and movement studio is fantastic.

Motel 6 does a better job than this place. No one seems to have a clue as to what they are doing. The management I think is more clueless than the line staff. The restaurant was horrible. It was the most bland menu I have ever experienced. No flavor.....just because you are green doesn't mean it has to taste bad! The rooms.....hmmmm where do you want me to begin....the concrete floors are freezing, the minimalistic decor is going to be dated in a year or so, the bathroom with no light privacy HUGE Issue...the patio that looks at everything in the resort and the poorly landscaped grounds....It looks like CAMP.

The entire resort would hear everything. They have this big white barn thing and if there was an event in there unless you rented out the entire grounds......you would be miserable if you wanted to go there to relax....It is just a joke.

We've stayed in Napa/Sonoma in the past, and have high expectations. We love hotels with a contemporary feel, and, looking at the Solage website and talking with the staff, we thought it would be great. Shortly before the trip, a staff member contacted us, and talked up the grounds -- explaining how wonderful they were, and how we wouldn't ever leave the property once we got there. The hotel's photos seemed to show a nicely-landscaped lux property. When we arrived, however, the property looked like a sad army barracks in the dust bowl. Almost none of the landscaping was in, construction was on-going, and it seemed like a full third of the rooms faced the parking lots. That said, the room was nicely decorated, but the rooms' windows and outdoor patios really are on top of one another - all facing each other across a square. No privacy at all. Because of that, the outdoor patio really isn't useful, and the rooms themselves are fairly small. We decided to leave. You can find much much nicer places to stay in Napa or Sonoma even at $450 per night. The initial clerk at the reception was fairly snotty about it -- and for this I nearly took his head off. The manager was very nice about refunding the room rate. I do think the property has the potential to be nice if they put in some bushes or something to give the rooms some privacy. What really ticked me off, however, was the way the staff had essentially flat-out lied about the state of the grounds before our arrival. If we hadn't been able to get a last-minute reservation ourselves somewhere else, I would honestly have contemplated a small claims suit for deception.

We chose Calistoga BECAUSE of the fact that it was a fresh new resort with a unique style and green attitude. We were not disappointed! If you are one to avoid dusty floral bed and breakfasts with lace doilies and antique dolls, this would be your place! We LOVED the unique conceptual architecture and the design of the rooms and buildings as well as the resort itself. It must just be a matter of taste. We really enjoyed the serene-dessert-like surroundings as well as the use of the sanded concrete for the floors, low dividing wall to bathroom, etc. The place was impeccably clean, the beds were very soft and the bikes were great. Honestly, it seems that all of the complaints on here relate to either people not liking the style of the resort or the newness of it. The staff is young, but they were very friendly and helpful. The plants need to mature (I guess) but we thought that they actually added to the sparse spa-like atmosphere. In fact, the plants around the mineral pools and bathhouse were completely finished growing, including lemon trees! We are incredibly picky about food since we live in a major food city. Solbar was strong...we ate there for dinner one night, breakfast and then room service. The food was fresh, the portions were appropriately sized and the wine list was nice. Honestly, we were not expecting much as we do not typically expect hotel food to be some kind of five star dining experience. Thus, we were happy with our choices and enjoyed our meals. Ultimately, I would recommend this to travelers who have a hip and progressive aesthetic and those who appreciate a forward thinking hotel that places an importance on sustainable tourism. I would also strongly recommend the spa/bath house and the movement studio. The resort is in a great location and the price is certainly right especially when considering the other options in the area. Enjoy Solage now before it becomes as popular as Calistoga Ranch or L'Auberge. I am absolutely certain that when these kinks (immature landscaping, I guess...) that everyone speaks of are ironed out, Solage will be a much-appreciated respite for those seeking a comfortable and relaxing respite in Napa.

There is a dock for an iPod so you can hook your music into the stereo system. There is a pool that is almost Olympic-sized as well as a smaller family pool where younger kids can swim.

The SolBar restaurant has a really well-rounded menu and the food is good. The continental breakfast that comes with the room is all carbs, but lots of bread choices, bagels, fruit, and cereal.

Why all the bad press? From the reviews I've read up to this point I was nervous to keep my reservation. But I am so pleased with what I found when I got here that I am writing this review while still at the property. Let me start by saying, I am a seasoned traveler and have stayed at other Auberge properties such as Auberge du Soleil and Calistoga Ranch, so I know the caliber people are expecting. But this property isn't advertising itself as an ultra deluxe experience. They are offering you quality, innovation and contemporary and that's what you'll get if you come here. I arrived at the property today and was enthusiastically greeted by a bellman. He walked me into the small reception area, where again I was warmly greeted and immediately offered a cold glass of strawberry lemonade (which was delicious, by the way). I was promptly checked in and handed over to the bellman to guide me to my room. While I was in the reception area, the bellman had lowered the windows of my car to keep it from overheating as it was quite warm this afternoon. He got on his cruiser bike (which I think is fun!) and rode ahead of me and directed me into a parking place adjacent to my room. Yes, the perimeter of the property is not more than dirt mounds, but the interior areas of the property are beautifully planted with specimen olive trees, lavender and other plantings that will be gorgeous as they mature (not to mention sweet smelling). The fountain in the courtyards weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t running, but when they do turn them on, it will be a very peaceful addition to the outside living rooms. I was brought into my very stylish studio, shown around, asked if I needed anything, and then was left to settle in. The whole property is wi-fi accessed, the flatscreen tv is IPod capable and there is a DVD player (though the property has no DVDs to loan at this time). I sat out on my patio for a while. It was very peaceful and quiet. As I was up here to work on a writing project, I collected my laptop and went to the pool. Folks.the pool area is completely impressive! The pool is 3 feet shy of Olympic size. There are gorgeous chaise lounges, tables, a shaded bar area and a separate children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool are with toys. There are tubs filled with ice and water bottles for the taking, and thick towels beautifully stacked at the entrance. And to top it off, there are wonderful cabanas with couches, chairs and tables. There was even a power strip in the cabana for me to plug my laptop into. I was visited no fewer than 3 times by Ashley (the pool girl) to refill my lemonade glass, bring me glass of ice for my bottled water, another chilled bottle of water later on and get this....an electric fan to cool down the cabana while I worked! This is a disappointing property to some of you??? I don't get it. Later as the sun was setting, one of the bellmen was walking around the pool area checking on guests to see if they needed anything. He secured the flap of my cabana which kept blowing back causing the setting sun to stream into the cabana and onto my computer screen. Almost done here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to mention the restaurant, SolBar. My husband and I had dinner at the restaurant on property and it was seriously delicious! The decor is amazing. It's hard to decide whether to eat inside or out. There is a fireplace inside that is like artwork, and the fireplace outside is surrounded by water...beautiful. The hostess was very accommodating; we started out by sitting outside, but we got chilly and she happily moved us inside. We shared the sliders and pork buns for starters and I tried one of their new specialty drinks with fresh fruit which was very refreshing. Our entrees were also very delicious. I had the sole and my husband had the short ribs. Oh, and the buns and corn muffins in the bread basket are melt in your mouth delicious. I know, I'm waxing on about this place, but I think Solage Calistoga deserves a big, giant thumbs up to counteract the sour grapes reviews that have mostly been written to date. While there is still some construction being done (too bad the spa isn't open) the fitness room and the movement studio are state of the art. They offer Pilates, boot camp and spinning classes daily. Oh, and did I mention the pair of cruiser bikes parked outside the door (with a pair of bike helmets in the closet of the room)? My only complaint? My \"Sol guide\" never followed through with our phone exchanges about arranging a massage for me. Apparently, roles were reassigned and whoever was to follow up with me didn't. Not the end of the world. Would I come back? Absolutely. This place will go the way of other Auberge properties. When Calistoga Ranch opened a few years back my husband and I were some of the first to visit. The staff was far more disorganized and confused than some people have commented on about those at this property...and look what people are saying about Calistoga Ranch now. If you want an established property, stay at one. If you want to be some of the first folks to try something new and different, get on the phone!

After finishing a lovely dinner in town one night, my husband said, \"I guess we have to go back to our cell block now.\" And that's pretty much how I would describe the rooms. They actually have a good base, but need to have some warmth added to the decor. It's just not quite there yet. So, for what they plan to charge after the initial rate I think this hotel will be way overpriced. If they knock the rates down a bit and realize they are what they are then they could be something good in the future.", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Solage Calistoga", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32143-d647781-Reviews-Solage_Calistoga-Calistoga_Napa_Valley_California.html", "Price": "$464 - $749*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">755 Silverado Trail</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Calistoga</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94515</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "647781", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1c/96/1c96938c4dd874f47d751ca7ca848a375large.jpg"}}
