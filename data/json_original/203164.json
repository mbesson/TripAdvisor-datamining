The hotel is old and classically stylish and does not pretend to be otherwise. However, it is kept spotlessly clean and we saw no sign of the 'wear and tear' that others seem to have experienced. Service is friendly and prompt with none of the condescension that other 'grand hotels' practice. We were being hosted by our friends so did not try out the restaurant.

The service was excellent - reception very efficient, breakfast staff very alert but not overattentive and cleaners and decorators (there were some) all willing to help when we looked a bit lost. We were given a quiet top floor room with a distant view of St Peter's basilica but the room looked jaded and the next day we asked to move. With no fuss (nor extra cost) our luggage was moved into a first floor room with a balcony overlooking the Via Veneto - noisier but the shutters kept most of that out at night and in the morning we knew we were in Rome. Breakfast offered everything we wanted from Parma ham and ricotta to bran flakes and granola. Good coffee. We didn't eat in the restaurant at night. Like everywhere along the Via Veneto it looked overpriced and, with the exception of the terrace, seemed likely to lack atmosphere - but we did not give it a chance.

Front desk staff were polite enough but don\u2019t expect a warm greeting. Hotel room: The hotel kindly upgraded us. We were given a room with a balcony over looking the front of the hotel \u2013 which was stunning. The room also included a seating area.

However there was nobody to open the door for us, the receptionist was surly and there wasn't even a suggestion that our bags would be taken up to the room for us- just a stubby finger pointing towards the lift. The room itself was nicely proportioned with tall ceilings and comfortable bed... but in desperately in need of a lick of paint. There were black scuff marks from suitcases / shoes covering the walls, with plasterwork chipped from the angles. The bathroom was also huge with lovely thick marble tiles... but again there were damp marks on the ceiling and the shower leaked. There were also little inattentive quirks like complimentary slippers being provided but only 1 pair for the 2 of us. Also, after an early start (for 6.10am flight!) we settled down for an early night at about 11pm... although at about 11.25pm we were disturbed by hoovering just outside our room. The man looked utterly bewildered when I asked if he would stop- he did without complaint- I assume they were closing the restaurant and he was cleaning up but vacuum cleaning at nearly midnight in a hotel?! Breakfast was good and service was friendly. I didn't try any of the hotel's offerings for lunch or dinner, although the continental lack of kettle in the room meant \u20ac10 splurged on two cups of tea from the comfortable bar. The location of the hotel is very good- nicely central but Via Veneto is not the idyllic boulevard it was (certainly in those old films) a few years ago. Think more busy dual carriageway. I would advise you to ask for a room facing the back rather than the front. The noise wasn't loud enough to disturb us but you could hear it, particularly at night.

The room was fairly clean, with the exception of the bath non-skid mat that was black with mold. Housekeeping did replace this promptly after I raised the problem to the front desk, but really in a 5-star these sorts of things shouldn't make it past quality assurance!

We had requested a room with a view, the first room we were given was very large (unusual for Rome) but shabbily and sparsely furnished, and looked like an old storage facility that had been made into a room. I wish we had taken pictures as it's difficult to describe - there was an ancient cracked mirror on one wall, a huge uncomfortable bed and a crooked glass light fitting that looked like it had been bought at a jumble sale - the only thing that was remotely five star was that we were given bathrobes. As we were staying there for a week we asked to be moved to another room - we are not fussy people and never complain and debated for ages before we decided to do this. It was supposed to be five star experience after all and was a special trip. When we went to reception and when they realised we were staying for a week they agreed straight away to move us - they said they only had similar rooms but that the next day 80 people were leaving so they could give us something better. The next morning we had to remind them about this and they said they would move our bags for us and that they could guarantee this room would be better - go out and enjoy Rome. It wasn't. To be fair it had a view - of the Chica Chica Boom strip club next door... The second room was much smaller and was on a corner - it had a carpet this time so that was an improvement. It had very basic, old and shabby furniture, and a bathroom that had more mold on the ceiling than I have ever seen in my life, it was everywhere. You could see where they had tried to wipe some of it off but it was so bad that hadn't made any difference as it was all over. As I said, we're not complainers so were too embarrassed to ask to be moved again. I honestly wish we had said something - I wouldn't live like this at home and can't express how awful it was to shower in there. We spent very little time in the hotel room, it just wasn't somewhere you would enjoy spending time. The breakfast was fine but along the lines of what I would expect anywhere. Some of the serving staff were very nice but the weekend staff were rude, barging in front of you to get through the door and generally not happy to be there. The only additional thing they had to a normal breakfast was Prosecco - a bit too early for me but a nice touch.

Booked two rooms (deluxe) through Moscow agent. As we'd had an early flight we arrived about 11am. I thought we would have to leave our lagguge and wait for check-in time (2pm) but receptionist checked the system and accommodated us immediately. It was funny: they still have original room keys - not the electronic cards (I'm collecting them through over the world). Hotel in my opinion should percieve as one of other 5* hotels in Rome: there are a lot of 5* like the Ambasciatori Palace - a litle bit old but still nice. From the first sight looks more as 4* but it's worth 5*: remember! it was the ambassadors residence, so nobel atmospthera, modest but with advantage. Rooms were pretty good: enough spacious, bathrooms're in very good condition - all marble, clean, new, double sink, bathroom amenities. Unfortunately they did not provides robes and slippers, and I'm not sure they priveded the turn down service in night. They have internet (cable) in all rooms - 15 euros per day, more than easy to connect. They have king size bed, multy lingual TV. Monibar is not really expencive (not chip, of course, but not too high prices). The breakfast is good - american: hot dishes on buffet - scramble eggs and bacon, but if you ask for any special omlets there was no additional charge. They have american cofee as usual drink but you can ask for espresso or cappuccino - no charge. Not all waiters at the restaurant spoke English fluently but if they didn't understand what you want they called somebody fluent in English. They have tipical italian food for breakfast - pomodoro cherry, mozzarella, spumante! (Italian champagne)/ Staff were very polite and friendly, all times ready to help. Almost all days they had seminars and conferencies, but on weekend they opend special hall in lobby with fireplace - very nice. Last day of our stay there were filming at the hotel - I think about \"Dolce vita\" times - all actress with 60-s hair-do, jueverllies etc. The location is really perfect - 2 minutes to Piazza Barberini, about 5 minutes walking to Spanish Steps, 5-8 minutes by foot to Fontana di Trevi, about 12-15 to Piazza Navona, 5-6 piazza Respublika.

My wife and I visited Rome in December '07. This hotel is located on the Via Veneto -- a quaint street near several restaurants, shops and other hotels. Its also situated in a good location for walking to many sites of interest. The hotel was nicely decorated for Christmas. Checking In: We were very well greeted by the doorman and hotel staff. Our check-in process was smooth and fast, without any line or delay (although this may have been due to the time of year we were visiting; the hotel was empty). Nevertheless, the hotel staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and spoke Engllsh. As expected, the check-in process involved the doorman, the bellman, the representative behind the counter (all of whom I felt obliged to tip). The Room: We had a standard room with a Queen size bed. We did not have a view of the Via Veneto; we had an exterior room in the back of the hotel, so our view was not so nice. The room was clean. The furnishings and decor were european as expected. Thread counts on the bed and pillows were adequate. The bathroom was nicely appointed with marble and various soups and toiletries. The shower/bath was large but oddly no shower curtain: this resulted in quite a flood of the bathroom floor each morning. The room was equiped with internet access and this was great for me. I was able to check my business email, instant message family at night, etc. I did not have converter for my AC plug and the hotel staff provided me with one for the duration of our stay. The Restaurant: Our hotel package included breakfast each morning. The full buffet each morning was just fine for our needs: scrambled eggs, bacon, assorted cereals, fresh fruit, and fresh baked items. There was a full wait staff as well to provide coffee, tee or capuccino. The staff was always friendly. Miscellaneous: The hotel had a full service bar in the lobby, although we always made a point of staying out of the hotel until the evening since we didnt go to Rome to stay in the hotel.

There were floor to ceiling french doors with a very very small balcony where we could lean out and get fresh air. We opened these at night for fresh air as it was quite cool outside at night and early in the morning. We had plenty of closet space and a small foyer which separated our room from the hallway. Breakfast was included in our bill and as we are not big breakfast eaters we did use this service. The eggs and bacon were somewhat undercooked, but we were able to pick some that was mostly cooked. Cereals, fruits, breads and juices were provided and the staff was very friendly. We had the best coffee at breakfast here than anywhere in Rome. It was served very hot in a china pot (several cups) with a separate china pitcher of warm milk. We tried dinner in the hotel one night.
