The famous stairs will bring you to the reception where the very helpful (and polite, which you rarely find anywhere nowadays) staff will great you. You will be given brochures with discounts and 'must see' of the city - which I found lovely, so we didn't need to go to the tourist info. A very kind man will bring your luggage up the stairs and will be preparing a lovely breakfast consisting of: croissants, cheese, ham, bread, chocolate muffins, cereals, juices (pure juice not those horrible mixes you usually find) and more. There is also a coffee machine where a good selection of warm drinks (tea, cappuccino, caffe latte) are available. We booked a room of 6 square meters. Space was initially a bit of an issue, but after organising it became quite functional. Fortinure is new and the room is very clean (and the cleaner comes every day). TV seemed new - maybe installed a bit too high. The bathroom was common, very clean must be said. Shower also clean and spacious. Flowers in the bathroom - nice touch. The location is perfect, Dam Square can be reached within four minutes. Basically every top destination from the hotel is within 26 minutes (the farthest being Albert Cuyp market) Top tips: 1. Have breakfast outside, there is a lovely terrace with flowers 2.

Breakfast was included and we must say that it was tasty and plentiful.The only problem were the stairs but this is common in Amsterdam . The last night that we stayed there my daughter forgot her glasses. So , the following morning before taking the train we asked the man to look for them. He said he would ask the lady in charge of cleaning the rooms and he advice me to send him an email . I did so , and after a few days he wrote they found the glasses, and asked me for an address to send them back. What a surprise when my relatives received a little box from Amsterdam !! We were travelling around Europe... We feel so much grateful for this service , it was really kind from them answering e-mails , caring , asking for an addresss, paying for posting the box ....

From the moment we arrived, the hotel exceeded our expectations. As previous reviews have stated, the stairs leading to reception (also the breakfast room) are remarkably steep. My two friends had massively heavy cases, yet the chap at reception lugged them to the room without even so much as a grumble and offered us a complementary drink when we checked in. I stayed in the spotlessly clean single room which was small but perfect for one and was cleaned every day. It is slightly worn and could do with a lick of paint and some fresh furnishings but it is a budget room so you get what you pay for. The breakfast provided by the hotel (included in the room rate) is plentiful and varied. You do have to share a shower and toilet with others on your floor but these were always free. Probably the biggest asset of the hotel is its location; 5 minutes walk to the Anne Frank Museum and Dam Square, 15 minutes from Central Station, 5 minutes to the Jordaan area and 40 minutes stroll down the canal to Museumplein. On our last evening, one of the people I was travelling with had a medical problem with her ears. Long story short, she was concerned about flying and further damaging her hearing. We went in search of an all night pharmacy with no luck. We returned to the hotel to ask reception to locate one for us. The chap (I'm really sorry we never got your name) went above and beyond. He contacted a doctor and got my friend ear drops and nasal spray to help ease the blockage in her ears. Bearing in mind this was 10pm on a Tuesday night and he provided her with these items free of charge, I think this was remarkable service and deserves attention drawn to it. We are incredibly grateful for his help and caring attitude. All in all, if you want exceptional luxury this isn't the place for you. If you want a central hub for sightseeing, amsterdam charm and service that is pitched perfectly (help when you need it, peace when you don't) then stay here. I certainly will be back.

I suffered a similar experience from the receptionist who insisted on cash up front for my 3 night stay. Nowhere was this mentioned on their website or the booking company's website and a subsequent check showed that they accepted all CC's. Being a late Sunday afternoon none of the cash machines in the locality had cash so I offered to pay the following day but he refused and insisted that he had to have full payment by 6.00pm. This immediately rang alarm bells so I asked to see the room which he reluctantly showed me - the very room thefree11 stayed in. It was awful and nothing like those that you see on their website. A slight disagreement followed and I guess he thought he had me over a barrel being late on Sunday with most hotels full. Anyway he demanded full payment in cash there and then or I could leave. Needless to say after a few more heated exchanges I left and found room in the NH City Centre. I thought that was the end of it and enjoyed a very pleasant stay with my wife and daughter. It was only when I returned home that I found out that he had put in a demand for several thousands of pounds on my CC. It was shown as a pending amount and remained on my account for over a week. He had threatened to charge me for one nights stay which I immediately disputed as it was he who was being totally unreasonable and it was he who left me little choice but to leave. I would not have stayed in the place anyway because the whole set-up just looked so unprofessional and I just didn't trust him. I am absolutely staggered at some of the positive reviews and wonder did I enter the wrong door but no it was definitely the Hotel Clemens. What they did was tanatmount to attempted fraud but thankfully they never followed through - clever because neither I or the Bank have the evidence to pursue legally! I doubt whether they actually intended to take such a large sum - just to screw up my credit limit in the hope that I could not use my card in Amsterdam!

On arrival we were greeted by the apparent owner. Without a word of welcome he requested not 1 passport as proof of identity but the passports from all 3 of us.as this is unusual We simply wanted to know why he suddenly needed the passports. He stated that all English are trouble makers and when we pointed out we where Scottish and remained to stay very friendly but he hit the roof and told us we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t staying there and he was keeping our first nights money as he had to wait around till half ten for our arrival. When trying to calm him down he became threatening and we had to call hotel runners, through which we booked this hotel. When talking to the very helpful and nice person at hotel runners he kept pointing out that he needed our passports PLUS he was keeping the first day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deposit and wanted us out since all English people are trouble Upon repeatedly pointing out that we weren't English but Scottish he went ballistic and became threatening to a point where we felt endangered! We tried to explain that we weren't going to ruin his place not that it was spectacular in any way to start with. he kept on ranting about Englishmen and how they were bad for his business. After continuing to point out that he needed to stop his rant since we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to demolish anything he threw us out or rather tried\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6since on the other line the hotel runner team member managed to calm him down eventually by taking full responsibility for any unlikely damages to the hotel through us. Had he not managed to let us stay at Hotel Clement we would have been stranded in Amsterdam without a hotel, hostel or anywhere to sleep since the city's accommodations were all fully booked (which the hotel runner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s member had checked first thing). Although the hotel was really uncomfortable and quite the opposite of clean it was better than having to camp in the open! Our first night was very awkward since we felt that we not only shared a room with one another but with the other guests too thanks to the paper thin walls and ceilings but after finally falling asleep, we were woken by a non English speaking cleaner who requested to clean our room. Although she didn't speak English we made clear that any cleaning was not requested and thought that she had understood since she left. After venturing out into the buzzing city we returned to the room - which had been cleaned and our bags had been moved. I believe that it should be clear that if guests do not wish their rooms to be cleaned whilst in the rooms the rented out rooms should stay locked whilst out! After yet another almost sleepless night, thanks to the mentioned wall thickness and nastily mattresses we were really looking forward to a hearty breakfast or at least something edible to kick start the day. Expecting to find the dining room open we found ourselves standing in front of an empty room with all edible things removed. Asking where the food was available until \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. not sure about the time \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 he told us that we had missed the timeslot and that he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t willing to extend it for people that slept in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not taking into account that the sign behind him pointed out that the buffet was actually still running according to the time.

However, the staff was less than pleasant. the first day we checked in there was a blond woman working the desk- she was very pleasant and helpful. She was gone the subsequent days that we stayed. The man who lives and works the desk is very unpleasant. All he cared about was smoking pot and watching tv (we could smell pot every time that we walked past the floor with the reception and you could smell it on our floor as well, but the smell was fainter). I personally don't care for any smoke, especially when the fumes travel to your room). The guy was also very rude, and though they claim the breakfast area is open until 11pm, he told us we could not sit there and drink tea because it is open only for breakfast- basically, he had set out the dishes already by noon for the next day and did not feel like doing extra work to clean any cups. For the sake of the hotel, I hope they get a new employee rather quickly, since, if it was not for him, our stay would have been much more pleasant.

It didn't look too bad and we were quite desperate for a room by the point we found here, as most decent places were fully booked. We were informed that the room was 150 euro for the Saturday and 120 euro for the Sunday but we had to pay cash, as they didn't take credit cards (really?). We left to retrieve our bags and some cash from an ATM, leaving a deposit of 20 euro. When we returned we were given a key each and left to our own devices. Although the guy on reception wasn't rude, he certainly didn't make us feel welcome. On getting to the room - two floors up but this is Amsterdam! - we found it to be reasonably clean (no ground in grime but could definitely do with more that just a flick of a duster but marginally better than some places I've stayed). However, as we moved our beds to be slightly closer to each other, we found used tissues and a toilet roll (unused!) under one bed.....the glass in the window was cracked and the window didn't shut properly. We had NO tea/coffee making facilities in the room itself and reception, where the tea and coffee machine was situated, was shut when we returned from town. Our TV didn't work either, which wasn't a problem for us but may be for other visitors. What was a problem was that reception always seemed to be closed when we returned so even if we wanted to report the problems we couldn't. Breakfast served from 7.30 - 10 am - we missed this on Saturday by not setting our alarm and we had to leave too early for breakfast on Sunday morning. As we handed in our keys for our deposit to be returned, there was absolutely no attempt at communication from the receptionist. No pleasantries such as 'Did you have a nice time?' or 'Have a safe trip home' were offered up - a VERY, VERY poor effort at hostelry in my opinion. On the plus side, our room was at the back of the hotel and, apart from the chiming bells, was pretty good for being able to sleep so close to Dam Square. Beds were ok, too except that the sheets were very ill fitting and poorly put on - I don't pay to make up my own bed!. There was also a bowl of sweets on reception, which we weren't shy at 'helping ourselves to', being as we had paid the best part of \u00c2\u00a3300 to stay in this no frills place for two nights and the sweets were the only attempt at a frill in the whole of this place.

No shower head, just a spout from which water dribbled down. Not a very pleasant bathing experience. The breakfast was the normal European fare, and the management pretty knowledgable about the city and helpful. And the location is great, maybe a 10 minute walk from Dam Square. But for me, the noise, and the steps were enough to put me off another stay here. I would look for another place as and when I do come back to Amsterdam And I loved the city and would certainly love to go back.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisboa", "Title": "\u201cCrime Scene Investigation\u201d", "Author": "Zvonieka", "ReviewID": "UR5894549", "Content": "\"Who slept on this bed last night?\", I asked myself as I decided to open my bed.

There is no reception area to speak of, just a wooden desk with a computer and phone. Our room, no 7, was toted as being the best in the hotel having a balcony. It was two further flights of stairs up and was dark and dingy. The antique furniture consisted of a battered old table and the balcony doors blew open several times during the night, the balcony itself being covered with old cigarette butts. There wasn't even a wardrobe to hang our clothes. On the plus points the sheets on the bed were clean as was the bathroom although we were pleased not to have to share the inadequate showers and toilet facilities that the other guests had to endure. The staff were curteous. The breakfast was average but not worth the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7 charged per person. The location was very convenient to all attractions, within walking distance of many.

Very high speed Internet connection is provided in all rooms for free -- in fact, I was able to remote access my PC in the US and watch local TV in the US through the link. If you forgot your PC, they have portables available. Although Rick Steve's have not discovered this hotel, he should. Within 30 minutes of collecting my luggage at Amsterdam airport, I am dropping my bags off at the hotel (using public transit only!) and ready to enjoy Amsterdam, Dee was extremely helpful in planning my day when I needed assistance. Excellent (not the heavy UK style) breakfast buffet with a small but very friendly/almost family staff. Although not a B&B, it approaches it BUT with extreme closeness to Anne Frank's House, the West Church and the downtown area. One very unusual item is the old fashion dutch style of cleaniness. There is no masking of smells with scents or airfreshners -- and the hotel appears to be a very friendly place for those suffering from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity or allergies. Lots of good ethnic resturants within 2 blocks. Being a small established, located in a heritage building that is around 150 yrs old - you can get the feel of yesteryear. For example, no fitness center -- but you will keep fit with the \"built in step-machine\" known as old Amsterdam stair cases. No elevator - so not for the handicap. The entire hotel appear to be have been completely renovated in the last 2-3 years, so everything is perfect with no wear and tear. I'm looking forward to continued layovers in Amsterdam at the Clemens for the many more business trips that I expect this year. It has been perfect for my needs. I am exploring cities in Amsterdam from here (den Haage, Delft, Haarlem) since the train station is approx a 8 minute walk away -- so after breakfast, I can go exploring and be in another city by 10am and then return in the evening to my base of operations. It is one H*ll of a pleasant experience -- totally exceeded my expection.
