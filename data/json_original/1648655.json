Very nice helpful staff though, we had a small room with a window looking out to the service duct, As bad as this sound the room reminded be of a toilet block, simply because of the green tile walls. It was very clean however. It had a shower over toilet arrangement but the drainage was not flash, it would overflow if you showered too long. The bed was very small for a double and was firm because it was simply a mattress on a timber 'bench' frame Clean mattress tho. The Aircon worked well but it was a 'in-window' unit and as the window was in a service duct it was full of other air conditioning systems, one of which dripped alot and landed on the top of our air-con, the result was a rather repetitive loud dripping noise that went all night.. It did take a while to get used to it :/ Also sometimes there was a long wait for the lift, on the last day around 8am we waited for 3 full lifts to go passed the floor and ended up getting frustrated and giving up and taking the stairs (6 floors with all our luggage) The wifi worked OK but was very unstable. Overall it was budget range accommodation and if I was to return to Hong Kong id spend the extra $30-$40 a night on something mid-range.

I booked through them weeks ahead specifying a room with a window which we agreed to reserve and pay for more. The day we arrived, we were told the room is not ready yet so we leave our things and set out to get some food. We were told to come back at 1pm and so we did. Then they were giving us this cramped \"triple room\" with no windows. Of course we refused, since we agreed on a room with a window. The lady in charge was getting mad at me for their mistake which was so wrong. She was telling me check in time was 2pm when the email they sent specifically states that check in time is 1pm, even the guy manning the booth told us to come back at 1pm. She even told me to just go to some other guest house which was SO RUDE but we've already paid when we arrived in the morning. This information would have been useful if she told me she couldn't accommodate us when we made reservations. If we weren't so tired from the journey, I wouldn't mind finding a room at Chungking Mansion. I was so mad and tired at the same time. I didn't expect 5 star accommodation from a guesthouse but I didn't expect them to be that rude either. Long story short, they moved us to a different room on a different floor - room with a window. Then we transferred to their guesthouse after 2 nights. They were nice after that like nothing happened. Maybe this could have been a good review if they weren't very rude at the start. As they say, first impressions last. I noticed that they had a lot of Thai guests and maybe that's their niche. So, just be warned. Because of that, I would not recommend this hostel and I wouldn't come back. There are plenty of guesthouses in this building who wouldn't go ballistic on you because they messed up the reservations. I recommend the Dragon Hostel on the 7th floor.

Towels, soap gel (body gel), shampoo (hair gel), pillows, water, coffee, very fast internet connection (700kbps, my bro told me), thing is you have to bring your own laptop xDD I guess it's in the atmosphere created within the hostel :) b. Convenient!! Not only it is accessible to places like Ladies' Market, Fa Yuen Street Market but also to Langham Place and Argyle Center! My mom and I could shop with ease and we could easily eat!!! c. REALLY CHEAP AND AFFORDABLE! But of course, since it's really cheap and affordable, do not expect anything out of the ordinary. d.

This was my first time staying in a hostel in HK and even though I was aware that the room was going to be small I was not prepared for the prison like conditions of the private room for a single person. The total size of the single private room is about the size of a closet. The bed is encased by three tiled walls and when you slip off the edge of the bed you are literally at the bathroom. I barely could close the door to take a shower b/c there was just no space! The noise in the room is also very creepy. The sounds get flitered through the exhaust pipes and by the time it reaches your room it has an echoey effect. I could not sleep and was very grateful someone happened to have been hammering at the same time and I was able to get upgraded to a double occupancy room. The double occupancy rooms were much better (I stayed in a room with windows) in terms of natural sounds (Mong Kong is busy so be prepared for city noises) and a bit more space. The bathroom is still very tight so if you're not that close with your traveling partner you'll need to schedule shower times as you will have to step out of the bathroom naked. There is no space and everything in there will get wet. Pros: - staff very friendly, however as noted by others the brother and mother have very limited English - clean - free wifi (hard to find in the city) and free local calls - discounted tickets to local attractions - location is pretty central with food and 7-11 close by Be aware: - If I havent' said it enough times - SOLO travelers do not stay in that private room - I stayed on two separate occasions (once by myself and the 2nd time with a friend) with a one day break. They charged me to leave my luggage behind.

Isn't it a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon? Rainbow, the guest house manager is a very down to earth pretty girl, who provide lots of information about places of interest in HK and food tips and always with a smile on her face.

Family trip...\u201d", "Author": "eDaLiNe", "ReviewID": "UR107233366", "Content": "We, a family of five, stayed there for two night on 24th and 25th of April, and because Easter falls on 24th April, it was considered peak season and thus higher rates for the rooms. They have a single room for five occupancy, is the family room for HKD 600/ night, one month earlier I have send my confirmation and personal details to Ms Ellen to booked it (no deposit is required), until two weeks before my arrival, I emailed Ms Ellen asking her about the confirmation but Ms Ellen claims that they did not received my booking, thus in the end because all rooms were almost fully booked, I have to take two rooms, one double room and one triple room for a total of HKD 800/night . HKD 320/night for the double room and HKD 480/night for the triple room. Generally people in Hong Kong are quite rude, and inhospitable. However, Ms Ellen, the householder of Oi Suen Guest House turns out to be quite the opposite, the exception one. Putting aside an oversight on my booking incident, she\u2019s been very friendly, accommodating and certainly resourceful pertaining to traveling around HK. Oi Suen Guesthouse is located in a building name Sincere House, almost all floors of this building has one guest house, but I think Oi Suen is the best out of the rest in term of cleanliness and value for money based on my previous research. At first glance, the building looks old and moldy outside, on the contrary, the room is clean. It is no doubt that the room is really small and a bit \u2018crampy\u2018, is certainly not advisable for people with huge physique, you can barely turn in the toilet. You will also find that there is no space for you to open up your luggage bag but to put it in a upright position. However, is well worth the money because of its location. It is strategically located near Ladies Market, Gold Fish Market, Langham Place and Mong Kok MRT station is just three minutes walking distant. Bute, Fife, Nelson, Portland, Shanghai, Fa Yuen, Tong Choi, Sai Yeung Choi Streets are all easily accessible, is walking distant to great shopping and dining. The room is equipped with fan and also air-con, LCD television, Wi-Fi connectivity, hot and cold water to drink, simple toiletries, clean sheets, comfy beds and you can also get laundry service for a minimal fee. They also have many TVB channels and programs which serves as an entertainment for us during late night, and because I am a big fan of TVBs, thumbs up for that ;) Plus they do room cleaning daily. We did not encounter any problems during our sleep, it was not noisy outside nor can we hear our neighbors. Overall it provides good rest and quality sleep. Is well worth the money. Oi Suen Guest House also offer discounted tickets for Disney Land, Ocean Park, Tram, Sky Terrace, Madame Tussauds, Big Bus Tour and taxi to airport which is a thumbs up. But still bumped about having to pay extra for two rooms instead of the family room which I have booked.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santiago, Chile", "Title": "\u201cI liked it.\u201d", "Author": "mker2010", "ReviewID": "UR104541910", "Content": "I got the tiny tiny room without window and with an even smaller bathroom.

The staff was very friendly and ready to answer any questions I had. I didn't feel like the place was secure though. I never found the outer door closed and my room had a regular old (easily copyable) key and no chain or anything as a back up for when I was alone in there. The elevators are just annoying (even more backlogged than the other HK places I've been). The location is fun, in the middle of both day and night markets (the Ladies Market is just across the street at night, the Fish, Flower, and Bird Markets are only a few blocks away during the day). But you can get closer to the Kowloon nightlife and other attractions. The room was small, even by the Hong Kong standards I've experienced elsewhere. I barely fit my bed (at 5'6'', I'm not THAT tall) and, although I've seen some small bathrooms, this one wins. You must be stradling the toilet to take a shower and I left the door open to turn around and wash my hands in the sink.
