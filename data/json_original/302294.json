Having stayed there on a number of occasions on both, business and private trips to Singapore, I always enjoyed the amenities the Pacific Club Rooms and the additional privileges this entails. Check-in is effortlessly taken care of by the dedicated staff at the Pacific Club Lounge, eliminating having to cue at the reception desk downstairs. Once check-in formalities have been completed, you are escorted to your room, where a brief overview of the functioning of the room\u2019s amenities is explained. The Pacific Club Rooms are all located on the high floors of the hotel and you reach them by travelling 30 plus floors up in a glass elevator, fitted to the outside of the hotel building. The elevator ride alone is spectacular, offering a bird\u2019s eye view over the Marina and the City. The Pacific Club Rooms are very spacious and furnished in a modern, but exclusive design. All amenities one expects to find in high class establishments like the Pan Pacific are, of course, at hand. Starting from a well stocked Mini bar, big Flat Screen Multi-channel TV, DVD Player, connectivity of your MP Players and I-Phones to the entertainment system, High-speed Internet to designer Bathrooms \u2013 it\u2019s all there. Choosing a Pacific Club Room gives you also access to the Butler Service and the Pacific Club Lounge, where you may enjoy complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails and drinks. Not to forget, the swimming pool of the hotel is a great place to relax and take a refreshing dip, in an exceptionally clean surrounding. All in all, I always feel at home in the Pan Pacific and, whilst it is of course a large hotel with many guests, the friendly staff always seems to succeed in making you feel special. It should be noted, that the Hotel is undergoing a major refurbishment at this moment (April 2012) and I look forward being able to report of the enhancements made after my next trip to Singapore later in the year.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jakarta, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cOne of Singapore's best: romantic, efficient, beautiful\u201d", "Author": "Staidthere", "ReviewID": "UR127985202", "Content": "My wife and I stayed for two nights at the Pan Pacific Singapore. We chose it because of the great number of good restaurants in the area, particularly those in the hotel. We ate dinner at Morton\u2019s Steak house and at Keyaki. We didn\u2019t go to Hai Tien Lo on the top floor because it was overcast while we were there. The hotel website said there were no rooms available on the date we wanted, but we had no trouble booking a room for that date through booking.com. We had a similar experience last year booking a room at Sari Pan Pacific Jakarta. Pros Good location. Probably because of my old Tanglin-Orchard Road orientation, I used to think of the Marina as rather remote, but The Pan Pacific is well connected not only by taxi (there are plenty) but by MRT. If it's raining, there\u2019s a covered elevated walkway to Marina Square, and you can walk past shops in a rabbit warren of connecting tubes taking you to the City Hall or Promenade MRT stations. Good first impression. Doormen unloaded our suitcases and we had a quick and pleasant check-in on the ground floor. All of the lifts are glass lifts that face into the atrium. Large deluxe balcony rooms. Our room 1215 was large with all of the amenities that would be expected, with plasma TV with a good selection of channels including HBO and numerous electrical outlets with universal plugs (if all hotels had them, we wouldn\u2019t need travel adaptors). The toilet even had its own door that could be locked. Double-headed shower. Wi-fi (available to everyone) for any number of devices was strong throughout the hotel, but we could not use it at Keyaki Restaurant, perhaps because they use a different protocol. Good view. The shade between the room and the porch worked by electric motor, and the view from the porch was beautiful, extending from the Singapore Flyer on our left to the Marina Bay Sands, Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and Clifford Pier on our right. Although there is no furniture on the balcony, it affords more than enough space for enjoying the view, particularly during the somewhat romantic Marina Bay Sands light show at 8 pm. Great breakfast in the room. We ordered between 7:30 and 8; it arrived at 7:45. The food was warm and well prepared, and the croissants were particularly delicious. Efficient service. We left early in the morning, so I was able to pay the bill the night before. They froze our ice pack, and I picked it up the next morning. Taxis were available from the road, and our departure was as smooth and fast as our arrival. Cons There is one strange aspect of the location of the balcony rooms: the sounds of accelerating cars for some reason reverberate between the concrete walls of Marina Square and the hotel, making us wonder if we heard race cars practicing for the grand prix. The sound was not bothersome to us, but perhaps that is because we were so pleased with the experience that we were not in a mood to be bothered. We didn\u2019t mind the early morning racecar sounds, and we feel Pan Pacific Singapore provided an excellent value in a location that needs more exploring.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWow what an amazing place - perfect\u201d", "Author": "Lovinglife170986", "ReviewID": "UR127949130", "Content": "This was a truly amazing experience.

Easy check in - had booked a deal through Agoda which included access to the Business Lounge. 27th floor with a view over the Marina complex. Room was huge, with free internet access, lovely bathroom, huge bed with the most divine pillows, slippers, robes, balcony with a lounger, desk and mini bar. We were so thirsty when we arrived, grabbed a bottle of water from the mini bar (very expensive!!). Anything in the mini bar is immediately charged to your account if you take it our for me than 30 seconds - so if you don't want to pay the ridiculous prices - dont touch it!) Headed out to the Marina Bay Shopping District which is amazing - within walking distance (so many designer shops - you want it, they got it!) Breakfast was included which you could eat in the business lounge or the restaurant - wow! what a spread with everything you could possibly imagine. Excellent service and you can eat till you explode. Didn't need lunch the whole time we were there! Business Lounge was exceptional, house pours (eg scotch, vodka, wines, soft drinks available for 3 hours) as well as delicious canapes (loved the mini cheeseburgers) - a balcony overlooked the Marina - they could have had more than 2 chairs outside though for those that smoke). Needless to say, we went there every night - the staff were always friendly and happy to have a chat and we'd have our preferred drink a couple of minutes after we arrived, they seemed to remember what we were drinking) Alcohol is extremely expensive in Singapore (about $12AU) for a bottle of beer, and about $15(AU) for a spirit. We did have drinks in the lounge one night - which was a very expensive exercise! Free shuttle bus took us to Sentosa Island so we headed over there one day (Sun Tec Mall I think it is called, lots of options for cheap eats). The hotel is attached to several shopping malls, and we unfortunately discovered the best one on our last day. Our check out was noon, but they will store your bags for you if you want to wander around for some last minute shopping before leaving for the airport. You can use the pool showers to freshen up prior to your departure. The lifts on the outside of the building are probably not for the faint hearted! We didn't have time to use the pool, and also didn't realise there was another bar near the pool. The hotel is being refurbished this year, so if I am ever back in Singapore I will check it out - although it looked fine to me..

Ms. Joohee Lee from Reservations was very prompt in responding to our email query about an early check in (almost 8 hours ahead of check in time!) and replied positively about accommodating our request. Since our flight arrived early morning, with a 5-year old in tow, an early check in was a priority for us. Pan Pacific\u2019s accommodating gesture was very reassuring to say the least! On arrival, check in was a breeze. We received a personalised service indeed, including a welcome gift for our little girl which made her day after a poor night on a long flight. Maribel from the Front Office who checked us in and escorted us to our room deserves special mention for making us feel very welcome. The location of the hotel is good, with ready access to public transport (MRT) as well as taxis. Then again, you can\u2019t go wrong there anywhere in Singapore! Our room was crisp, clean, comfortable and tastefully refurbished. The king bed was very comfortable and the bathroom artfully modern. The coffee station / TV console was uniquely designed and the availability of every conceivable audio visual cable for use by guests highlights the details that have gone into planning a comfortable stay for visitors. The complimentary internet was a very welcome feature. I can assure the hotel management that this is perhaps one of the extras that tip the balance when travellers look around for a hotel in a very competitive market in Singapore. Visitors to Singapore, where free and excellent public internet access is now the norm rather than the exception, would expect no less from the City's hotels. The room rate offered was value for money andthe buffet breakfast, included in the rate, would satisfy even the harshest crtics in the hospitality business. We would consider the Pan Pacific Singapore as a first option during future travel to Singapore and have no hesitation in strongly recommending it to any traveller to Singapore.

We booked a room with a panoramic view and although the room was exemplary I was a little disappointed by the view as it was angled away from the harbour and didn't show much of interest in the city - I suspect one of the cheaper harbour view rooms may have been a better option. We didn't eat an evening meal at the hotel but had breakfast which was generally very good (apart from one inedable overdone waffle from the buffet which we replaced) - pulling off the neat trick of appearing smaller and more intimate than it really was - sadly it seems that it was being redeveloped in near future.

In summary Pan Pacific provides excellent service and good value for your money. All our needs were taken care of by the team from Pan Pac who were excellent in their jobs of making one feel right at home.More details in my review below: Price: I took the weekend preference package costing SGD341(after tax) a nite for a paranomic room. This comes with free upgrade to the next room category or a complimentary fruit platter, daily buffet breakfast, free wifi, free parking and guaranteed late check out at 3pm. This is definitely value for money if u compare to similar priced hotel which costs around the same but does not include complementary parking, wifi and late checkout. Smooth Reservations and Fast Check in: I saw the deal on Pan Pac website and tried to book thru their website but unfortunately their server was down so i had to call to book. This was a breeze and the reservation desk was very attentive to details right down to when i'm arriving and what kind of bed configurations i need. I arrived at 1230PM on the actual day to check in and was allocated a room within 5 mins. All the things that i've asked for over the phone were taken care of. Impressive! There were no queue at the counter during the times we were there to check in and out which is another bonus. Nice clean Room with good layout: i was upgraded to the paranomic room with balcony as part of the package. The room had a view of the Marina Bay per my request. In terms of the room layout i have no complaints. Reasonable amount of space for my belongings and to move around after placing a baby cot. What i really liked is the bath room. They have seperate enclosed area for shower, toilet and bath. Room was clean and everything was working which was great. Excellent Service: I tested their service desk a couple of times with different request and their response was great. Calls answered promptly and it took them almost nothing to revert with the things that i've asked for. I ordered in room dining one of the night and the food was served on time with full table settings (iced water included without me having to ask). When we are done with the food, the person showed up within a minute of calling to clear the table and trays. Everyone from the reception to the cleaners are friendly and very good at their job taking care of our every need. Excellent service. Breakfast: We had buffet style breakfast at Global kitchen and they had a pretty good spread for breakfast compared to other hotels which i've tried. The breakfast would appeal to folks who are into Asian food as they had a pretty good range of Asian style breakfast. On the two days that we were there they had Dim Sum, congee, wanton mee soup, nasi lemak and prata for the Asian selection and the usual bread, sausage, Ham, eggs, fruits items which you would expect from the continental breakfast. There was also no queue to get into the restaurant for breakfast which is a good thing when u have two small kids who are hungry. The restaurant provided baby chairs and children utensils so if u have kids they are well taken care of. Location: In terms of location Pan pacific is very convenient. It is connected via underpass or overhead bridge to three shopping complex and two MRT lines. No more worries if it rains as u can walk across to Marina Square, Suntec and Millenia walk via the connected walkways or underpass. If u want to venture further the CIty hall MRT train station is a short walk away thru marina square. You can also take the circle line from Suntec which will bring u to the Marina bay sands integrated resort if you are interested to visit the casino. There's plenty of restaurants and food courts all around the hotel so food and shopping is easily available. Pan Pacific definitely rank high up in my list in terms of Service and value for money.

I stayed in one of the Pacific Club Rooms and the service from the pacific club staff was nothing short of outstanding. I like to think of them as \"Yes People\". I don't think a single request of mine was met by a NO. You do pay a premium price for staying in the club level of such a hotel but it always makes you feel better when you leave feeling your money was well spent. The pacific club rooms are well equipped and the bathroom and products are impeccable. The good - The pacific club allows you to enjoy your breakfast in a few different locations in the hotel and the breakfast is on par with what one would expect at such a hotel. Not outstanding but definitely adequate. Area for improvement - The one aspect of where the room was lacking (which many business travelers consider the most important) was the bed. The bed was not as plush and comfortable as ones I have slept in the Marriots, Hiltons and Four Seasons of the world. It is harder than it should be and I really hope this is something that is looked into as the hotel undergoes major renovation. Secondly even though the hotel by itself is excellent, its integration into the GHA loyalty program is a little choppy. It is something that could be a little smoother. Also all major loyalty programs offer a point system which can be redeemable for free hotel stays. This is one of the major draws for a business traveller, and one reason someone might choose from a Hilton, Marriott or Starwood group of hotels. I stayed over 20 nights at the hotel and havent earned a single free night. Whereas one of the aforementioned hotels would have earned me at least a couple of free nights. But all in all, if you want to be spoiled by one of the friendliest staff, in a premium location, this is defintely the hotel to stay at in Singapore.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cReturning to a home away from home\u201d", "Author": "TheTravelCamel", "ReviewID": "UR126029924", "Content": "This is my third visit to the Pan Pacific. The superb experience of saying here commenced when booking the room via email where I received excellent and professional service from Joohee of Guest Care Services. My arrival at the hotel was efficient with the usual courteous and friendly welcome. A lovely touch was that several of the staff (and not just those at reception) said \"Welcome back!\" which did make me feel valued. I chose the Delxue King Balcony Room, which was an excellent decision. Rooms face the Marina area and even though I was not on a high floor, I was still very happy with the view. I had to briefly leave the room, but when I returned the porter had just finished placing the bags in my room - but the problem was that they weren't my bags! This was quickly rectified by a very apologetic porter, but I just laughed it off as one of those odd incidents that can occur when travelling. The room is delightfully decorated in warm tones, but perhaps not as pleasant as the Pacific Club (where I was upgraded on my previous visit). The bed is massive and comfortable, and provided me with a very restful sleep. The bathroom is one of the best I've seen at a hotel, and the dual-headed shower and decent-sized bath gives one plenty of options to unwind at the end of a day. A sliding door opens onto a balcony which, at this level, was surprisingly noisy. I originally entertained the idea of sleeping with the door open, but since I do prefer sleeping in silent surrounds, closed the door before retiring. The presence of this balcony and its view certainly makes this room better value for money than the Deluxe King and if one is paying a lot of money to stay here, it is worth spending a bit extra to obtain a better quality room. I ordered room service for dinner, and it was punctual. The food was again of a high standard, but as one would expect, it cost more than one would pay in areas outside of the hotel. I didn't eat breakfast here, so cannot comment on this aspect of the hotel on this occasion. Internet access within the room was free and even better was that if one visits the business centre there is no charge in completing an on-line check-in and printing a boarding pass. This is one of those extra features that makes this hotel special. All three of my visits have only been for one evening at a time due to the expense of staying here. However, I am determined to stay for at least two nights on my next visit later this year as this is a place where a extended stay would really allow one to absorb the ambience of this wonderful hotel. Even though this is an expensive option in Singapore, it certainly is worth the money if you wish to pamper yourself (or someone else) in a hotel where service and comfort combine to provide an experience that is rarely matched.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cTriple Celebration\u201d", "Author": "Josephine V", "ReviewID": "UR125873415", "Content": "EXCELLENT HOTEL...

The staff booked me into the 30th floor meaning I had to go outside. No head for hights so they rebooked me immediately to the 18th - no fuss as it must be a common request, and done with a smile without making me feel a fool. Top service. Worth noting that up to floor 22 is inside, above, including the top club floor rooms. The Business floor lounge is on 22, so if you're booking it may be worth noting the difference - or just close your eyes in the lift! The room had a balcony view of Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion, a nice seat for relaxing outthere, good work facillities, a 32 inch screan which is a bit small by many room standards, and a reasonable bathroom but I found the rain shower very hit and miss. So it overall would have been a 4 from me, until I was checking out. I was going to the Conrad, just a few minutes walk away (this was an add on booking) and the lady checking me out insisted on giving me and my colleague a free hotel car ride around the corner.

The hotel management must be very proud of their team.The hotel is excellently situated, we stayed in a deluxe room on the first night before a cruise.It had the most spectacular views of the Marina you have ever seen. Upon our return from the cruise we had the delight of an Executive Room and well worth the extra money for the additional benefits, it makes you feel very special having your breakfast served in a private room on the Executive 22nd Floor, plus afternoon tea and evening house pour drinks in the early evening. Check in on arrival and departure was totally stress free with their assistance for luggage after a long flight from the UK. If any-one is a smoker like myself, be rest assured that the hotel does have smoking areas around the hotel which the concierge are pleased to show you, I was concerned with the Singapore no smoking laws but didn't find it a problem at all. We only ate in the Brunch Restaurant which is situated on level 4, good quality food, drink and service.

The only minor issue i had was that on checking in the sheets on the duvet were stained - however this was changed very quickly when I complained.One of the key advantages of this hotel is its location. Many people may prefer to stay in Orchard road. However for me over the years Orchard road is really getting too crowded for my liking. As such the location of the Pan Pacific is terrific - being close to Marina Square - adjoining the hotel and you can walk through via the hotel and then connect to Suntec City - all undercover. If you would like to go to Orchard then you the MRT is within walking distance and the taxis are cheap and abundant. The hotel has been around for a while now and I think it has been renovated and updated over the years. Although I think they spent this around the lobby area and perhaps the spa area however the pool and rooms were not really updated except for perhaps the bathroom. LCD TV, electronic blinds and new carpets. Beyond that the decor of the room is quite bland although the standard rooms are quite spacious and the bed although a little hard - very comfortable. The other area that I am impressed with he hotel is the quality and taste of their room service - their breakfast, burgers and also asian menu were very tasty and over the years with my business travel i have eaten a lot of room service.

We arrived at the hotel just after 8.00 am doubting very much whether there would be a room available for us so early but we were absolutely delighted that a room was available straight away. Check-in was very efficient and soon we were in our room (912). King Deluxe with Balcony and what a superb view even on a lower floor. The night time view was breathtaking - singapore flyer, Marina Bay Sands, Fullerton Hotel and the CBD buildings all lit up. The room was very spacious and spotlessly clean. Free wifi, electronic mini-bar (be careful very expensive and items are automatically charged to your account if removed for more than 30 seconds), remote control blackout blinds which ensured a good night's sleep, every conceivable adaptor supplied for your laptop. tea/coffee making facilities, dressing gowns and slippers, fabulous bathroom toiletries, white fluffy towels, wonderful separate shower, huge superking size bed which was very comfortable. The staff were absolutely outstanding. Ivy on Reception handled our check-in extremely efficiently. Our luggage was brought up to our room within 5 minutes of arrival. The Pan Pacific certainly knows how to look after their guests. We only ate in the Global Kitchen - we took advantage of the 50% discount food voucher offered by SIA Stopover Holidays. We had breakfast there on both mornings choosing from the a la carte menu (the buffet american breakfast would have cost 35 $$ each and we could not have used the discount voucher so the a la carte menu worked out cheaper and we did'nt have to queue at the buffet counter). The food was amazing, everything was cooked to perfection and we spent about 25$$ each after the discount. If you prefer to eat breakfast outside of the hotel there are many places to choose from at the Marina Square and Suntec malls which are easily accessed direct from the hotel. Drinks at the hotel are very, very expensive. A draught Tiger beer (pint) was about \u00a39 at the Atrium Bar!! The pool area and gym facilities looked superb, although we did not use them except for the showers. Our flight from Singapore was late at night and our checkout was 12 noon so we could use the shower facilities at the pool and they were superb (towels/shower gel provided). Alternatively you have the option to book some time in their hospitality room to freshen up before your flight and this can be done when you check in. If you need to printout your boarding passes for your flight home, simply go to the Business Floor and they will allow you to print your passes free of charge. The SIA Stopover holiday package is great value - the free transfers to and from the hotel were well organised, 50% food discount on the a la carte menu at Global Kitchen, free Hop on/Hop off SIA Bus which stops just by the hotel, many discount vouchers and free admission to many attractions.

City Hall and Esplanade MRT stops are nearby and can get you anywhere in the city. China Town, Orchard Park and the Vivo City link to Sentosa are all short rides. The taxi stand outside is staffed by hotel attendants and always seems to have several taxis waiting, for near immediate service. Watch out for \"limo\" taxis. They cost more but queue up like regular blue, silver and other taxis. The Pan Pacific has met all of my expectations for a good work-travel hotel. If I could afford it, I would happily stay as a tourist as well. The hot water runs consistently and freely. The cleaning staff are reliable, and don't move my things around, but they also don't use a bit of clutter as an excuse not to clean. Bathroom, linens and surfaces are always sparkling. The \"Service One\" concierge staff are prompt and accommodating. The laundry/dry cleaning service sends someone up right away and returns (as if by magic) your clothes directly to your closet. It could get expensive for a long stay, but laundromats are few and far between. The towels are large, clean and absorbent, and the robes are nice. The toiletries are good enough quality for my long hair and sensitive skin. The wifi provides a fast and consistent connection.

Three malls (Suntec, Marina Square and... one other) can be accessed directly from the 3rd and 4th floors of the hotel, through the \"back\" entrance. The malls contain cheap but tasty food courts, coffee shops (including 2x Starbucks) and more shopping than any one person could ever need, from higher end/luxury items, to good \"bargains\".

We all enjoyed the room - practically silent air-con, comfortable bed, great chair at the desk, big bath, a powerful shower, all great.

Atrium hotels are always nice to stay in, with the corridors are illumunated by sunlight coming from up. Everywhere inside the hotel was full of real living orchids and it was a very nice touch. We stayed at the 30th floor with a bay view. And that was priceless. Nothing was blocking the view at that level and we had enjoyed the CNY fireworks like sitting at the front seats of a theatre. Our room was an executive with a balcony looking to the bay and I really advice to get that type room. It is well-worth the price. The hotel was quiet. The beds are firm and comfortable. The bathroom was better than average and very functional. The furniture was a bit old, but clean and didnt bother us at all. BTW, I heard that the hotel will be going under a renovation period during May and June. The location of the hotel is simply excellent. Some nights we returned at midnight and tried to enter the hotel from the Marina Square shopping center connection or from the Millenia Walk connection and we didnt have any trouble entering the hotel from the doors at level 2 or 3 (by swiping our room cards). This is surely a plus and gives you privacy. It is a feeling much more like returning your own home.

Upon arrival a bell boy quickly took our luggage and gave us a little card to retrieve our luggage at check in. After there was around 4 Ferraris and a Rolls Royce in the valet car parking area which was quite a spectacular site and we took the opportunity to take a picture next to the Ferraris. Now entering the hotel building itself we were shown towards the checkin counter where there was two staff there and no guests but they both said they were busy but then a lady quickly came up to the desk to check us in so we barely had to wait. I think here name was something along the lines of Shirimini, she was absolutely wonderful greeting us warmly with a smile giving us a great first impression. Whilst checking us in we asked if there was a chance for an upgrade and she without hesitation gave us a fantastic upgrade to a room on the 32nd floor with a great view of the city and also the upgrade included breakfast which was nice as we didn't have it included in our original booking. We had to take the glass lifts which was spectacular especially as we arrived at night looking at the city below. When we entered the room we were pleased with the size and layout of the t.v. Beds, desk, chairs and the overall design of the room. We couldn't find anything in the room that could be faulted although the bathroom door was unable to be looked easily because the door didn't not line up with the hole for the lock so I had to play around with it for while before I could the bathroom. Some say the rooms look dated but I think they look modern enough and the room is very practical like the ability to control everything in your room just at the side of your bed. During the stay I managed to get tonsillitis and found it increasingly hard to swallow without acute pain so I went down stairs to ask if I could see a doctor and the lady said that they don't have a doctor on site but there is Raffles Hospital with 24 hour emergency there. I then said oh because I have a sorer throat and find it painful to swallow and just like that she made a quick call and then a manger I think came and gave us two taxi vouchers to get to the hospital and back to the hotel and personally escorted us to the taxi. Upon arrival to the hotel after the hospital the concierge came to us and asked how I was and then when we arrived in the room after 10 seconds the manger called and asked if I was ok and if we want more water and we said yes please so in a minute or two a man came up with 4 bottles of water (we already had 2 from this mornings turndown service so now we have 6) We found this to be really nice and thoughtful of the manger to ask how I was and offer us more water and she also said for me to drink lots of water which will help with my throat. The Pan Pacific really know how to treat its guests and this was another case of that which made our day. Unfortunaley there was a small comment made when leaving global kitchen after the buffet breakfast by the lady at the front desk of the restaurant which went like this she asked if we enjoyed our meal we said yes she then said to my father I can see he enjoyed it alot and started shaking her stomach implying that he enjoyed it alot because it is big which is true but is not needed tobe commented on and luckly for her my father easily shrugged it off and took no notice of it but it still is quite offensive especially to hotel guests. This was the only problem we had with the hotel but it is minor so I'm not marking down the hotel because of this one lady. The hotel also has a pool of good enough size and a 24 hour gym which is smallish but quite adequate. Check out was OK, the man gave us a bill for breakfast but we told him our room included it so he quickly took the bill back, then he never asked for the room keys back when he said goodbye but I asked if it wants it back and he said yes. Overall the Pan Pacific is a superb hotel and is great for anyone wanting a hotel well located and has the best customer service of any hotel I have stayed in and accomodates families well.

Few times we were sitting at the Atrium bar and the quality of the offer was good,though they were little bit slow and once I got a dirty fork, but they were so embarrased when they saw it so it was clearly an hones mistake, but should not happen any way in 5 star hotels.As we used this hotel just to sleep and have breakfast I can not say much abouut the quality of other facilities. There is a gym on the ground floor, seemed quite spacious.The pool and pool are are quite nice and oppening hours are good, I did not have time, but would really recommend daily relaxation near the pool.There is taxi line at the hotel entranceand it goes quite fast, but if you do not want to wait you can simply book a cab in advance in the lobby.The hotel is connected with the Marina Square shopping mall (was not crazy about the offer of it, but there are some ok restaurants/ fast foods), so you get to enter the mall from the hotel and you do not have to get out. Staff was generally verry polite and helpfull. The room: Very clean, quite enough space for everything you need, bathroom was great with bathtub and shower and separated area for the toilette. All the amenities of a 5 * were there. We asked for the executive room with the view over marina and it was well worth it. Ask for as upper floor as you can get, because there is another hotel in front so if you are on the lower levels it could block your view. At the highest levels there are Club members rooms. Our room was at the 26th (2613) floor and had a terrace and I was really happy with the view - over whole Marina, famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Fullerton hotel, Financial center, all the tall buildings from the postcards :) The food: The breakfast buffet was great, the offer from the food from all over the world was really more than enough and I can not imagine that there is a person who could not find something excellent to eat. Everything was really tasty (and I can say I have pretty sensitive taste budds :)). The offer at the Executive lounge was not that big, several things to choose from but it was all delicieous. Of course that asian food dominates but is was so tasty and made in a way that any European or American would be satisfied.The hotel has several restaurants, one near the big one with buffet breakfast with good wine selection and the other one is on the last floor with fantastic view over the city. All hotel restaurants are (as expected) quite expensive. There is huge number of restaurant outside on the Singapore river banks (Clark Quay and Boat Quay and all around Marina) Internet: Very good every time I accessed. Surroundings of the hotel: Location is very good and we went to Marina and Clark Quay on foot (longer walk). But be aware that the hotel is tall and from the terrace you get to see everything and everything seems so close, but when you get down you have to walk a lot. The location of the hotel is such that everything you want to see in this area is not very far so the cab is not expensive. If you are not into walks, just grab a cab to where you want. Orchard road, Zoo, Sentosa are not in the city center to the cab bill is expectedly higher. Highlights: - great great view over Marina Sands Bay, - interior of the hotel (little bit \"cold\" but soooo different), lifts are capsules made of glass and those used for upper floors slide on the outside wall of the hotel (nice view), - food at the breakfast and in executive lounge. - will definitely come back again to this hotel and ask for even upper floors. Shortfalls: My trip was 5 months ago and I can not remember any bad things, so it really made good impression on me, and I trully recomended this hotel to my friends (one already booked it).", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little Rock, AR", "Title": "\u201cThe absolute best!\u201d", "Author": "Cha0sOnTheR0ad", "ReviewID": "UR123430641", "Content": "I stay in hotels 160+ nights a year worldwide.

Fantastic location, even better for F1, as the track runs by the hotel and from some of the balaconies you can see a massive stretch of the track. 2. Staff were brilliant and the hotel was extremely clean and modern - no complaints at all! 3. The year that we travelled to watch the F1, the Ferrari team were staying in this hotel, clearly shows that it is a great location for the track etc... 4. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants but did order room service that was excellent, and fantastic value for money. Bad: 1. When we arrived, due to the location of the hotel and the F1 we had to exit the taxi and walk to the hotel as streets were blocked off. Distance wasn't too far but when you are exhausted and you have luggage its not ideal. 2. Although the hotel does have a small pool etc... you get the distinct feeling that you are in a business hotel, It felt like you were to be ushered into a conference room or something - doesn't have a holiday feel about it at all - very clinical. 3. This may only affect people staying during the F1 race - but, a bar/club had set up a temporary tent building that might as well have been in our room! We were 33 floors up and the noise coming from this pub/club was so loud, we were kept up till 6am (when the music stopped) for two nights, we slept with the ear plugs in used for the F1 and pillows over our heads. We only stayed a couple of nights and it totally ruined our stay, I would definately check that this won't be the case if you visit for the F1, or at least specify you would like to stay in the other side of the hotel. Noise was horrendous! We did complain though and to be fair to the hotel they wiped the bill clean, and we were not charged for any room service etc... to be honest I think they had had many complaints about the noise!

The 'average' rating I was about to give should be placed in our context of four and five star hotels in the large Asian cities, such as Singapore, KL or Tokyo. All hotels in this area in Singapore are well connected through the underground corridors, subway stations and shopping centers so we weren't too worried with the specific location. This hotel is connected to two smaller shopping centers and Suntec. Having booked the panoramic view at a surcharge we expected a room facing the water, but we got a city view, which from the 27th floor was fine, but we could've saved ourselves the extra charge. The room was nothing really special but had everything one might need and the electric curtains are always a nice touch. We could've done without the concrete beam blocking some of the view. The compartmentalised bathroom creating a separate shower and toilet seemed a bit too much at first, but was actually very pleasant for our two adults and one toddler use. Too bad about the constant flooding from the bath which went all over the bathroom making it quite slippery, even around the toilet. The pool looked fine, but we didn't have the time to try it. Not that we needed to as our next stop on the same trip was a beach resort. The elevators are nice. Staff was as you would expect for such a reputable hotel. Of all the local hotels though, this one does seem to be off the radar. The taxi driver from the airport didn't know it and even the express service bus to the zoo and such - which has a stop at this hotel - doesn't mention it.

The hotel has so many positives; excellent customer service, free fast wi-fi and local calls, a later checkout offered to us for no charge, large generous room size with hi tec gadets galore, comfortable bed (not loving the pillows that much as too soft for me personally but easily forgivable) and the interconnection to Marina Square Shopping Centre (no need to experience the Singapore heat to go for a wander), close walking distance between your pick of two MRT stations and numerous dining options (we only dinned at Global Kitchen once). A few small minor negatives which are likely to be throughout other reviews; the lifts (yes they can be slow but we were on holidays and who could stay impatient when each ride is like your very own Charile and the Chocolate Factory experience in the glass elevator!?) , the fact we found none of the shops surrounding the hotel open until 10.30-11am (not PPs fault at all, but I would strongly consider getting brekky included next time we return to the hotel) and the annoying mini bar being pressure sensitive so we could only just jam in our fruit for fear of being charged sky high. We dined at Global Village at PP on our first night as we were tired, it was very tasty, beautifully presented, great service and food reasonably priced although the menu was not very exciting we found the drink prices very expensive (which is the same all over Singapore).

We've stayed at various hotels in Singapore and to be fair this was one of the best we have stayed in. Yes it is an older hotel but we didn't find our room to be at all dated - we were on the 32nd floor so perhaps this room has already been renovated? We arrived tired from 2 long flights but didn't have to wait for our room. We were taken straight to our room on the 32nd floor for a private check in which was a nice touch. We were delighted with the view from the room. The housekeeping services were very good - nothing to complain about whatsoever! The service at the poolside was fabulous. Underwater music was a nice touch and there was always a plentiful supply of towels, iced wated, cool face towels and fruit - even lollipops for the children - all very welcome. We chose to eat breakfast at the global kitchen as there was more choice, though it was quite busy and noisy, but still enjoyable. The only negative was a waitress who blatantly asked for a tip! One morning I chose to eat in the Bering suite and wished I'd eaten there every morning as the choice was so much better than I'd expected and it was peaceful and relaxing. My only gripes happened to be not so much with the hotel itself as much as with the central reservations, however they had a negative effect on our stay. 1st. I booked many months before our trip. I chose the advance purchase rate. I was instructed that full payment would be taken at the time of booking and this was fine, however, no payment was taken. I emailed 4 times to ask why no payment had been taken and asked them to ensure that my booking was confirmed. All I received was the standard booking confirmation but no replies to my emails. In the end I assumed that I would simply pay on checking out of the hotel. Some FOUR MONTHS after I had booked - out of the blue - the hotel suddenly took payment for the whole amount - again with no communication to me whatsoever. Call me a cynic but it seemed very convenient for the hotel that they had waited until the exchange rate was much to their favour; further, because they had not taken the payment when they were asked to (at the time of booking) I had missed out on a promotional 0%rate on my c/card - not the end of the world but most annoying. Again I asked for confirmation that I had paid - but again I never yet recieved a reply and had to resort to taking my credit card statement with me. 2nd. When I booked I wanted to take advantage of the promotional rate which included access to the Bering Suite. On the website it states ' children are not recommended in the suite' ; since our (very well behaved) daughter was travelling with us I telephoned central reservations to check what ' not recommended' means - I was told that it was absolutely fine to take well behaved children into the lounge. I also made enquiries on TA and other members assured me that they had no problems taking their children onto the lounge. I was MOST UNIMPRESSED therefore, when we arrived and were told that the policy is now that children are 'not allowed' in the lounge during the cocktail hour - one of the staff in the lounge even suggested that she find an empty office for my daughter to sit in, on her own, whilst we enjoyed drinks! Ludicrous - we would NEVER have booked if we had known that our daughter wouldn't have been allowed in. 3rd. When I made the booking I stated that I wanted a rollaway bed for our daughter - I was given the rate and was happy with it. Some FIVE MONTHS after I made the booking I received an email to say that they had noted my request for an additional bed but there would now be more charges to pay for it - even though I had already agreed a rate previously . So whilst our stay there was good - it was somewhat marred by the unfortunate events I have mentioned. I received a guest satisfaction to fill in shortly after our stay and I did raise these points but disappointingly I only received a standard reply with no apology.

Bed was comfortable and shower was excellent. All other aspects of the room were great too. We had room service which was prompt and the food was lovely and reasonably priced for a 5 star hotel. Breakfast each morning was extensive and enjoyable. The pool was lovely if a bit cold! We were greeted each time we visited and handed free water. We had reason to make queries on various occasions and these were met with courtesy and good information. We moved mini bar items to house other things in the fridge not realising until later that it was an automatic charge system. Upon explanation we were told this was fine and they removed the mini bar items for the duration of our stay so we could use the fridge and no charges were made. The location was convenient with an easy connection to a great shopping centre and cabs were easily available outside. If I were to complain at all it would be simply to say our view was not great and pay per view movies would be a great addition.

When we arrived at the hotel tired and a bit bedraggled, the room was ready for us. Furthermore, we had booked an executive room with harbour view and access to the Bering suite. The reason was, that we wanted to make sure to be on a high floor, where we would not be bothered by possible live entertainment in the hall. (See my room tip). The Bering suite was a first for us, but worth the extra money, if only for the enjoyment of the quiet breakfast there. The service of the Pan Pacific was also put to the test during our visit. Firstly we arranged with the concierge to provide us with a properly licensed taxi to take us through customs to Johor Bahru to the Malaysian car rental agency. This arrangement was spot-on. Furthermore I needed some minor dental repair work. The service desk guided us to an excellent medical center.

Throughout the months, the hotel staff has been very accommodating and responsive to my email correspondences regarding feasibility of plans and all the miscellaneous queries, despite the fact that it is my first time with them and that i will only be staying for a night! I have even went down weeks before to survey and check out the hotel, amenities and rooms, and they were kind enough to show me around the rooms, the pools, and every part of the hotel that i needed to know more about. So many of them are so kind to me that i find it hard to single out any particular person, which tells you just how great the entire team is. During the day itself, they assisted me in all the preparations, and even helped to specially decorate my room at the time we were out - again something that needed special coordination via sms which was carried out to perfection. All these during one of the busiest days of the year! (they were supposedly almost completely booked out) I could go on and on about how helpful they were... The room itself - executive room, great bathroom and amenities, beautiful and cosy room, balcony was slightly aged but provided a splendid view of the entire Bay, and the experience of watching the fireworks from the comfort of the room was unbelievably awesome! Food was great with all the afternoon tea, canapes, breakfast... Nice pool, nice gym... This year we will be staying in a club room... cant wait!

Ms. Sheng Sheng then took us to our room to complete the registration process which was seamless. Kudos to Ms. Sheng Sheng. Our room was Room #1010 which was Deluxe Twin with a balcony. The view was awesome with a view of the city, Marina Bay and the Sands Hotel, and the Singapore Flyer. The room was spacious well appointed as was the bathroom which was well stocked with toiletries. The beds were so soft that I immediately fell asleep. After we had settled in, the doorbell rang and a hotel staff delivered a fruit platter to welcome us. Breakfast was included in the rate so we did take advantage of having breakfast at Global Kitchen in the 3rd floor. The staff was equally attentive and everytime was coffee cup was empty, I did not have to wait long before it was re-filled. In fact, I did not even have to ask. One of the wait staff walks around looking at each guests cup to see if it needs to be topped off, The food selection was plentiful. It had dim sum, Indian breakfast, and the typical items for american breakfast - waffles, sauges, scrambled eggs, and made to order omelette There are two MRT stations that are within 5 to 10 minutes walk from the hotel - Promenade and Esplanade. Both can be accessed via the Marina Square Mall or the Millenia Walk Mall so if it is too hot, one can cut through the malls to reach the MRT stations.

Meanwhile Pan Pacific (along with Grand Park Orchard and Royal Plaza on Scotts) are the only few hotels that give free wifi to the guests even if you only book their cheapest room. The room is of decent size with good quality bedding and sheets. Bathroom is not super luxury, but totally acceptable. Sometimes I arrive earlier than the check-in time.

We had only a 3 night stay to sample this hotel and the F1 before moving to our usual haunt, the Fairmont. We had a Pacific Club room on a high floor. We had been warned that the wait for elevators was a sore point, but the club/higher floors have their own set and we did not notice a longer-than-average wait time. The room was large, clean and well furnished and a few added touches were a nice surprise. There was a little stand with 8 magnetic containers of snacks such as chocolates and nuts, and also a little pan pacific gift for us on the pillow. The welcome letter also explained that non-alcoholic beverages were free from the minibar for pacific club guests, and a host of other benefits. We had a partial view of the track from our room so could see the cars whizzing about at night. The only disadvantage to the hotel's proximity to the F1 was the noise of the cars, and also the after party which went on until about about 3am or so each night, and could be heard clearly even on our floor. If you go during the F1 and are a light sleeper, they supply some earplugs in the room in anticipation. The club was quite beautiful and spread over 2 levels, one for breakfast and one for the evening (called Sunrise and Sunset). The club was very quiet when we were there and we frequently had the place to ourselves. You also had a good view of parts of the track if wanting to see the F1 in air-conditioned comfort. The evening cocktails were the standard red/white/champagne offering but also included real cocktails and a selection of spirits, while the food offered was very nice and the warm dishes were cooked to order (but speedily). The continental selection, desserts and cheeses were all out at the buffet and the desserts were especially tasty. Breakfast could be taken in one of 3 areas (club, main restaurant and an extra conference room converted to breakfast use due to the hotel occupancy). Breakfast was nice and as a bonus had roti prata, even in the lounge. Overall the breakfast was not quite at the level of the Fairmont or the Fullerton but you definately won't leave hungry and I did not notice it lacking in any specific areas. We did not use the gym facilites, pool, room service or other restaurants this stay, but the pool looked nice and not too crowded. The location is good but not as convenient for the MRT, and during the F1 numerous road closures mean you need to plan your trip a bit more, and we had an issue with a taxi driver not wanting to take us there due to traffic. Another took us home with no problems and we saw no traffic... The nearest MRT is Esplanade station on the new circle line (CC) but more useful is the nearby City Hall interchange, which is a 5-10min walk. Check in was quick and easy and efficient and we were shown to our room without delay.

As soon as i stepped in, i noticed that it was MUCH smaller than the previous one i had stayed in. Just because i was travelling alone this time DOES NOT mean that the hotel can give me a MUCH SMALLER room with the SAME amount of money i was paying. Aside from that EVEN THE BATHROOM GOT SO MUCH SMALLER. I could NOT understand why i made same reservation, SAME MONEY.. BUT GOT MUCH WORSE SERVICE. 3. What made the room worse was the paperthin walls. I could hear the next room as they coughed, laughed, talked on the phone...etc. It was crazy if your next door neighbor were night owls. 4. The pillows stank. I wasn;t even sure if they changed it. There was a really musty smell to the pillows, which i requested for change immediately. 5. Not only were the walls paper thin, so was the DOOR. Unfortunately, the staff stairs was just right next to my room, being the last room on the corridor.So each time a staff goes in and out of the room, IT ACTUALLY FELT LIKE SOMEONE WAS OPENING MY DOOR. THAT'S HOW LOUD AND ANNOYING IT WAS. Imagine sleeping at night, then to hear a door opening....... that's how scary it was. Definitely, DON'T STAY IN THIS HOTEL THE SECOND TIME.

We arrived at the Pan Pacific an hour late after a long and arduous flight. The porter took care of our luggage and directed us to reception. 2 reception staff were at the desk, each serving one guest. No long queues. We were welcomed and asked if everything was OK, as we had been expected an hour earlier. Jennifer Wong came down, introduced herself and then kindly gave each of my children a cuddly teddy in Pan Pacific uniform as Christmas gifts. Jennifer and her assistant then took us to our room, showed us how everything worked and then took a photo of the family for us to keep as a souvenir. Jennifer advised us to not hesitate in asking if we have any special requests and made an ordinary family feel very special. We were completely bowled over by the welcome. As far as the room went, we were very comfortable during our stay. The room was well equipped, had a baby cot as requested and we found the air con to be quite and efficient. There is free Wifi internet included in the room rate. I managed to drop (and smash) the shaving mirror in the bathroom on the Sunday night. Within minutes it had been cleaned up and we were not charged. We found customer service throughout our stay to be outstanding. My two-year-old daughter loved the pool on the fourth floor, as it would seem did lots of other kids at the hotel..The poolside staff were always alert and attentive. The good buffet breakfast served in the Global Kitchen was varied and extensive. Hai Tien Lo on the 37th floor does an excellent weekend brunch.

We were on the 22nd floor, and to get to it, we went in the outside futuristic lift. It was like something off Thunderbirds, zooming out of the water up into the sky, and the view was brilliant. The room was spotlessly clean, with everything you could possibly need- don't bother taking toiletries as the hotel offers everything. The hotel is well situated. Really friendly helpful staff. Would defiantly stay here again if we ever went back to Singapore. Brilliant. The only downside perhaps for some people, is that the rooms could do with a bit of a facelift, as the decor appeared a bit dated. But to be perfectly honest, I just thought it added to the charm.

Key word was service service service. That was exactly what we DIDN'T get. In particular, from the front desk personnel. Housekeeping, room service, and the executive club staff were more than attentive, accommodating and efficient. We stood at the front counter for at least 5 minutes, conveniently ignored. Lady said, \"I'll check you in early, but we need 45 mins to prepare the room. Please come back in 45mins-1hr to get the key.\". That in itself was awkward, as we would not have a clue when the room was ready, and we were risking going up to the counter several times. 45 mins passed and we went up to ask if the room was ready (we had only gotten 2 hrs sleep on the flight that night and needed to crash). Another agonising few mins wait being ignored (in particular by the male youngish staff who was just staring at the screen as we stood there). When we finally got somebody's attention, we clarified we were here to grab the key. The lady took out the check in registration form and asked us to repeat the whole process. She did not even recognise us from barely an hour ago as the couple who just checked in! The rest of the stay was pleasant. A/C in room 3116 was abit on the warm side although it was adjusted to coolest setting. TV was poorer quality LCD and was not very big. Loved the bathroom and the bed. Breakfast at Global Kitchen was not bad, but not the best I've had. Good variation every morning. Location is convenient, Marina Square is just opposite and a 7-11 store too. Taxis are easy to catch at the hotel and costs no more than $6-7 dollars to get around the city. Last slap on the face. With the early check-in, we asked the staff at the executive lounge whether we could have the breakfast that first day. She said it would be fine. At check-out 4 days later, the front desk staff then dropped the bomb that our first breakfast was actually chargable. I stepped in clarifying that we HAD gone through the trouble of checking with one of their staff first if it was okay. She then said, since we're checking out early and forfeiting the breakfast on the last day, she would not charge us. I don't know if I had cut her in too early before she got to the part where we would not get charged, but what's the point of bringing it up if it's a non-issue in the first place? #2 hotel in Singapore?

Don't get me started on the euphemisms hotel marketing staff use to describe their rooms, just note that deluxe is the cheapest room possible. There are subtle signs of ageing throughout, evidenced by the tiling, the grout, the old Hitachi flat screen TV and the modern but not very modern bathroom fixtures. However, given the hotel was built some time ago, and last renovated in 2005, the management has done a good job of maintaining the facility compared to most. While the St. Regis, Shangri La etc.. are clearly a higher standard, note that the price of staying here is much less\u2026 and it's still pretty nice if you want to be in the Marina Bay area. As noted by many, the location is good, particularly if you are attending a conference at the Suntec centre - it's a short (around 200m) albeit humid walk to the convention meeting rooms. Beyond the convention centre lie hundreds of shops, none very interesting - international mall fare - but there are also tens if not over a hundred food stalls that look very interesting. And at the farthest end of the Suntec complex from the hotel is a Carrefour, which has a reasonably extensive though expensive wine selection. Singapore wine prices are worse than Canada if that's possible. And if you don't like Carrefour, there's a private bottle shop opposite its entrance. Internet in the hotel is free (hallelujah) and doesn't require a password or secondary clicking (hallelujah again) and is of average speed (subdued hallelujah). Torrent download speeds average around 200kb per second, but for some reason (Singapore firewall?) Google sites are slow. The exercise room was quiet the few days I was there, and relatively spacious with high ceilings and the usual equipment. There's a pretty outdoor pool also - a blessing in this humidity. Speaking of pretty, while at first glance the interior design seems gimmicky, even gaudy, the tall (30 story) triangular atrium with its glass elevators has charm that grows on you. The breakfast buffet is fine, the standard Asian high end buffet - omelette/congee stations, dim sum choices, fresh fruit, chafing pans with Western, Chinese and Indian selections. It's not the best in terms of the breadth of selection, quality of the food, nor freshness of the fruit. But a hidden gem is a juicer hidden at the back of the buffet - if you spot it, you can get a woman to squeeze you fresh juice on the spot.

Came back to find out that the shine had worn off slightly. It is located well in the Marina/Suntec area. However, a few service lags which are minor, but not common for a pan pacific property make me hesitant to have it as my exclusive hotel in singapore. Lots of great options around from the Mandarins to Ritz and even the Fullerton so as I ramp up my travel to Singapore this will be on the list of options and will give it another chance, but will still spread my business around and ask my team to do so until we find THE place. Pluses: Excellent physical property, very clean, and MOSTLY good and professional service but uneven. JANICE at the Global Kitchen restaurant greeted us daily for breakfast and is an absolute star! She remembered everyone's names and greeted and welcomed you like an old friend. She needs to train a few others on staff. Janice thanks for your great service - you are one of the reasons I will return! Great restaurant selection, easy cab availability. Colleagues said the indian and italian places were excellent. We had snacks and drinks at the atrium cafe downstairs by the lobby and had lukewarm, ditzy, inattentive service and it took over 45 mins for an order of wings and spring rolls. This was at 3:45 pm in the afternoon. Breakfast inclusive rates are a good deal here, since their breakfast spread is comparable with the top hotels in the region and has something for everyone. U.S. travelers with jet lag can go in early and have heartier fare too. Service - an uneven experience with a few 'wtf' moments. Check in - asked for a room with a view of the flyer and Marina Bay Sands. Was told that \"very sorry - rooms are pre-allocated\" in a firm tone. I was booking direct with the hotel and not on a consolidator site or anything. I know rooms are pre-allocated, but lets have some flexibility. This is a pan pacific and it was NOT full. Not a motel 6 through priceline. I was too tired after a 18 hr nonstop from LAX-SIN so just dealt with it. Not happy when I am paying well over $350/night. WTF A waiter at breakfast was asked for chili oil (la-yu) for a colleague's dim sum breakfast. They immediately said \"ah, no,so sorry\" and walked off. Didn't even check. Again this is Chili oil in SINGAPORE, not like asking for a corn dog or something. WTF Concierge desk - some of the staff were very helpful and patiently answered questions. Others were rude, impatient and dismissive. We were floored. It was clear that you could ask only one question per approach (no others waiting) and got very brief answers for what were details questions about transportation and rental of a sports car, and an executive van etc. We actually went across the street to the Mandarin to get maps and assistance with bookings. WTF We also got conflicting info on airport transportation. We needed a larger vehicle for luggage and were quoted various figured (`$100) by the concierge, and then $50 from one bell captain and then $45 from another. We decided on this, but later realized we still made a mistake - you can get the larger cabs (like a mercedes or chrysler) to run on the meter to the airport and that would be approx $37. I'm sure we were supposed to get this detail somehow and missed some element of it, so our fault, but 3 of us all felt like someone could have taken a moment to clearly explain the options. WTF Rooms - the balcony rooms have a VERY large balcony. A little bit too much space wasted there, but we did not spend a lot of time in the room. Room service was prompt and tasty. Generally clean and comfortable with electric drapes etc. My bathroom shower didn't drain properly, but it wasn't worth mentioning. Spa - I tried to call the spa for an appointment but their line was busy - called service one instead and asked them to make the appt and leave a message back confirming. Didn't happen. This is a large hotel and they have several groups and air crews staying, so little personal touches like this are hit or miss. Stay at the Ritz for more $ but a better level of service if this kind of attention to detail is important. All in all, despite the service issues, most of the staff are friendly and professional. Not really warm like most singaporean hotels. Again, management should get Janice to train some of the surly snooty front desk and concierge staff. She is great! I will still stay here again though as long as I keep my expectations in check.

We stayed in an executive twin on the 24th floor with a partial harbor view. The Good: The Pan Pacific Singapore is a large & attractive hotel. The views from the glass elevators and from our room were stunning. Our room was not large, but the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and well-appointed. We utilized the ample storage space, hangers, and ironing gear to freshen up our clothes. With our room and rate we were entitled to visit the executive lounge on the 22nd floor for complimentary house pour beverages and appetizers in the evening and a well-stocked breakfast buffet in the morning. We really enjoyed access to the lounge and the service there was very good. The Pan Pacific is an easy 10 minute walk from the City Hall MRT station, which we used to travel all over Singapore. The FREE WiFi worked reasonably well and we wanted to support a luxury hotel that offered it. The Bad: We found the service at Pan Pacific to be polite, but disinterested. Felt like we were just part of the herd. We chose Pan Pacific to splurge a little and to toast our late grandfather, a businessman who spent a lot of time here. We explained this to concierge and asked if there was a guest book in which we could sign our grandfather's name. The answer \u2013 \"No.\" The man didn't provide alternative suggestions on how we might honor our grandfather in the hotel, just \"No.\" (Thanks buddy, you're the best.) Despite us knowing better than to dine in the hotel, we decided to visit the Global Kitchen on the 3rd floor. We had just arrived and were tired and hungry. I mean, how much can a buffet cost, right? Well, the buffet and 2 drinks cost $200. Lesson learned. Again. Caveats, Constructive Remarks: In fairness, for the previous parts of our vacation we were accustom to staying in small boutique hotels and specialty accommodations where we were TRULY treated like royalty. I understand that this level of service may not be possible at Pan Pacific... but they could at least try. Of the places we stayed on our vacation, I rank Pan Pacific Singapore 5th out of 6. And if they want to investigate my top ranked hotel, they should look at Hanoi Elegance Ruby \u2013 THAT is a 5-star experience.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat Great and Great Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "ViennaTrip W", "ReviewID": "UR120215781", "Content": "Decent size room, pretty modern, well maintained.

Over all of the years I've stayed at the hotel it has always had a comfortable understated elegance. You know you are staying somewhere nice, but you don't have to prove it. Rooms are a great size and the atrium just adds a sense of space and privacy that can't be achieved in a more traditional tower hotel. They dont build them this way anymore. For me the bathroom has always been a standout. The original layout goes to show the legs that great design can have when it's right from the start. There are plenty of food and beverage outlets to choose from, but it was great to see an improvement to the room service menu from a selection and quality perspective. Having missed out on Chicken Rice, but moreso the ginger rice over many years I finally sampled this as one of my last meals in the city. Now I know what everyone has been raving about. Not to mention a great Char Kway Teow. A final Singaporean food fling! We held a function one evening around the pool, which was a perfect location coupled by some of the better pizza to be had in Singapore (as it is not easy to come by) and plenty of ice cold beer and champagne for our friends. The perfect casual way to say good bye. My daughter was with us and can't stop talking about 'the Pan Pacific'. Needless to say she was well catered for and managed by the staff in all of our encounters. We were lucky to have the use of the executive lounge which is strategically positioned above Marina Bay with a spectacular aspect across the bay and up to the city. Serving breakfast, morning tea, afternoon tea and cocktails in the evening is a bonus on the overall experience and there is a healthy spread of food and beverage options at all times.

The hotel is very large with a spacious lobby area and a very calming ambiance. Even though there are many guests, it doesn't feel crowded at all. Our room was beautiful with a large bathroom and plush comfortable beds. The free internet was extremely useful for us to search MRT routes and places of interest. The Service One officers, whom we called several times for assistance, were very helpful. The hotel is a 2-3 minutes walk to the Promenade MRT station (yellow-circle line) and about 10-15 minutes walk to the Singapore flyer. As this is a business district, it is quiet beyond office hours. Room service was also very good with generous portions. However, we were unfortunate to be appointed a beyond terrible housekeeping staff to clean our room. The beds were haphazardly made, rubbish bin by the working desk was not cleaned out, and a used sanitary bag from the previous guest was kept hanging in the toilet booth throughout our stay. I emailed the hotel about this and received a prompt reply, which I appreciated.

At reception, Ryan was most welcoming and assisted us greatly during the whole stay - always greeting us by name when we walked past - either going out or coming in to the hotel. At the end of the first day we made enquiries about updating to the Club Level & enjoying all the benefits that come with that. Not because there was anything wrong with the room we were in on the 10th floor, but because we decided to treat ourselves to a bit more luxury at the end of our 7 weeks away from home in Australia. Well worth it. Again, this was no problem for Ryan & we were given a discounted price to do so, after he negotiated with his supervisor. This was arranged to occur the next day. We then moved to a room on the 32nd floor with all the Club benefits. The rate ended up being discounted even further, due to the unavailabilty of a room on floors 33 to 35. Went from being great value to Exceptional value! The staff presentation, their service, their helpfulness, the quality of food, the benefits of the upgrade all made this one of our most pleasant hotel stays we have experienced.

From the moment we arrived we were impressed with the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. On presentation of my GHA Platinum card we were immediately upgraded to a balcony room on the 33rd Floor with magnificent views to the Marina Bay area. The room was spacious and tastefully furnished and the bed was comfortable even though the mattress was a bit on the firm side. The only drawback was that wardrobe space was a bit limited. We had access to the Pacific Club dining room on our floor which offered a wide range of excellent breakfast choices and 24 hr butler service. This service plus the Reception Staff at the Club level were exceptional. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble for the friendly staff. We were both suffering from colds and we were provided with complimentary honey and lemon drinks. On a daily basis we were offered free pre-dinner cocktails and canapes. We enjoyed the in-house restaurants and found the food quality and service to be very good. The hotel location is excellent with easy access to several shopping centres e.g. Marina Square and Marina Bay Sands. The latter is quite new and has interesting features such as the Venice-style canal, Sky Park and Casino - not to mention the up-market shops and a number of good cafes. The hotel Concierge was very helpful in organising outings and transport etc. A highlight for us was the Night Safari at the Singapore Zoo. The hotel commenced a rooms upgrade while we were staying there and some construction noise could be heard during the day - however this did not bother us. We in fact wondered what upgrades were necessary since our room anyway was excellent (apart from the rather small wardrobes). A bit of a nuisance was caused by the fencing erected in the streets for the Grand Prix - this is nothing to do with the Hotel but it did cause some inconvenience for crossing the street.

I figure the most accurate way to position my review is to sum up what I look for, and how this hotel matched to my needs... Location Great location, right on Raffles Blvde. Easy access to the Marina, and the restaurants and shopping. Lots of different entrances and exits to head you in the right direction! Easily a 5 min walk to the MRT - all underground, through a shopping mall, so even easier :-) if you wish to spread your wings further. About a $10 SGD cab ride to Sentosa island, so it is in within easy reach to all the major tourist sites/must sees. Cleanliness/Comfort Cannot fault it.Iif you are looking for a comfy bed, with facilities to match - then here it is! Rooms are what youd expect from a high rise, we were upgraded to the 30th floor, marina view suite. It wasnt huge, but the view more than made up for it. If you are staying more than a week you may get cabin fever, but great for a nice room in a top location. Price We booked via the hotel website and were given an upgrade as a part of our booking. $270 SGD per night, was well worth it.30th floor and breakfast (great range of internation feasts for breakfast) was included. External elevator for rooms on the 23rd floor and above, you didnt have to wait long! Service Secone to none. From the moment your taxi delivers you to the door, you have nothing but staff willing to help and welcome you. The concierge, doorman, reception were all brilliant and attentive.The paper of your choice on your door each morning dint hurt! Plus I had an email before I left Aust asking me for my details to ensure smooth check in, and an email when I left letting me know i had left something in my room( my phone charger). In summary we had no dramas with the Pan Pacific. It was value for money, great location and the pool was great for some time out, with even more first class service to offer. The glass elevators that were positioned on the exterior to the builiding only added to the prestige of the property. Want somewhere clean, friendly and good location?

The pool area is large and comfortable. There are many food outlets inside the hotel and all seemed quite good, despite the high prices. The desk and TV were good in the room. Bad points: The bathrooms are terrible, especially the small shower rooms with double-headed shower that never lets you escape water. The beds were too hard for my taste. The interior was outdated and the carpeting in the room and the public areas seemed very old and stained (I saw it being vacuumed regularly, but it's old). Maybe if you book directly with the hotel, you'll get some gorgeous renovated room, but for the room I booked on Hotels.com, I was put on the 5th floor (the first floor of rooms in this tower) with a dark balcony.

The hotel is attached to a mall which has numerous - and nice - shops and restaurants. The room was on the 21st floor which had a fantastic view over Singapore. It was large, clean and well-equipped with lovely toiletries in the bathroom. Connectivity is as good as you could ask for. In fact one drawer contained every cable you could need, and I had with me iPhone, iPad and netbook and was online every night! Hotel wifi was good, though occasionally intermittent. This is not the hotel's fault; apparently it is due to Singapore's humid weather and also the large number of very tall buildings. Service was pleasant and attentive. Check in was great and if you have an overnight flight back, they offer you a room to shower and change after you've checked out and before you set off for the airport. There is a business centre on the 22nd floor with PCs and other facilities and helpful staff. I worked there when I needed some real peace and quiet. Leisure-wise, there is a beautiful, clean swimming pool open until 11pm. I swam in it three times and I was only there for a week. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful and you can get coffee or cocktails by the pool (depending on the time of day/night) There is music underwater, which is lovely, although they seem to have only a limited number of tracks, which might become annoying if you swam every day. But it didn't marr my abiding memory of swimming alone in the pool on my last night with fireworks (the rehearsal for Singapore's national day celebrations) exploding in the sky above me and reflected in the water around me.

The room was very quiet, the only noise I heard was the very occasional road noise like honking but overall was pretty good. Very nice bathroom, with a separate bath and a great shower.

The staff in general were very friendly, even the house keeping staff greeted you if you walked passed them in the corridor.

I only had cereal so I can't speak for the quality but it was massive. Free wifi throughout the hotel was great and the pool was very nice. The gym was a good size, it has plenty of cardio machines a number of very high quality weight machines. But I am a free weight person and the free weights was lacking. Their heaviest dumbells is 24Kg and they had no barbells. So I think the gym would suit most people, but if I was staying there for more than a few days I'd have to seek out a proper gym with free weights to get my gym fix.

The stylish elevators are a nice touch, and the way the lobbies into to the rooms are quite interesting and unique. Aesthetically, it's a pleasant looking hotel. My partner and I stayed in a King Deluxe room with a balcony (I'm a *cough* smoker). Maybe I shouldn't be all too surprised considering the humid weather of Singapore, but upon entering the room I felt it had a rather damp feel. Though clean, and spacious, I still felt the rooms feel was rather damp and dense, if that makes any sense. It's something small, but a touch which makes a difference is that way the wardrobe area is planned out. In between the 2 wardrobe areas, there is a nice place where you can set your luggage on top of. It's sometimes the simplest of touches which can seem insignificant but is a pleasant addition to a comfortable stay at a hotel. The bed was a king sized as requested, unlike other hotels, it was most certainly a king sized bed and not 2 singles or doubles put together. Shame on them! Regarding comfortableness of the beds, I had no problems with it. Speaking of sleep, I was read that there is a live band that plays music until around mid-night or so at the bar downstairs, and because of the narrow lay-out of the building, the noise tends to travel up and can be a slight disturbance; quite possibly because I was made aware of this before staying here, though I did notice the music at night, it wasn't as big of a disruption as I'd imagined. I was impressed with the size of the bathroom, separate toilet as it's separated by a glass door. I particularly enjoyed the shower here, the shower heads were just superb and the water strength was strong - and ever so satisfying! (cheap thrills I know). Again, it's the little things like that which pleases me; it's the little unexpected additions which make the difference. To our surprise every day after returning to our hotel, our 'house keeper' would arrange our toiletries, in perfectly neat order on a hand-towel. We found ourselves coming back to our room, and running to the bathroom to see how our toiletries were laid out next (in ascending order on our last night) - yes, it was amusing, but a fantastic touch of service which you rarely see! In regards to the location, it's very convenient and I really can't elaborate all too much on what everyone else has had to say about the location. I'd say really good location, and if in need to go anywhere, they have a good taxi system so a taxi is never difficult to get. That said, there is a nice little bar called \"Stereo Lab or Stereo Lounge\" just outside the lobby, near the taxi stand. It's likely due to the influence of alcohol, but the music is generally good (there is a Top 50/R&B room, as well as a Dance/Trance room) and the crowd seems to be in the 21 to 35 range(I'm 29), but not overly pretentious where anyone older would feel too uncomfortable. Before 10 it's free entry, and after 10 I think there is a charge of SD$20 I believe but I'm not 100% certain. A nice little place to drink and have some fun, and you can also crawl your way back to the hotel if you end up having a little too much fun! All in all, I'd say it is a very adequate to good hotel. I was very pleased, but the rooms just felt a little too generic and lacked 'warmth'(if that makes any sense). That said, the staff were always very helpful and accommodating, and everything else was above average to good.

Had cancelled other prebooked accomodation in Singapore as reviews from PP seemed so much better but we left feeling hotel was over priced for families. We purchased 2 interconnecting rooms for 2 adults and 4 children which included breakfast for 4. We arrived a little earlier to the scheduled check in and were told rooms were still being cleaned so we went to nearby shopping centre and returned at the designated check in time. When we go to our room only 1 rollaway bed was there so we had to request a further bed in the other room (even though this had all been done on reservation). We were on floor 23 - amazing view and the lift ride up day or night was spectacular! On arrival to room there was a note from management to inform they were doing renovations on floor 30 & 34 and some intermittent noise may be heard between 10-6. Also in the Marina Bay was rehersals for their National day so some noise may be heard from this too. Some noise from the Marina was heard but did not bother us as was interesting to watch. BUT, we were woken at 8am on a Sunday morning by constant tapping - sounded like we were living next door to a wood pecker! This could only have been hammering noises, and was witnessed most mornings well before 10am. My husband eventually rang down stairs on the 4th morning but was told even though we could change rooms/floors this would not alter noise. Such a shame as we paid a princely sum for our 2 rooms and had no prior notification, nor was their anything on their website to advise of this. Rooms were nice- clean, great view, shower a little cramped, bed a bit on the hardside for our liking. Price of mini bar was a joke - $7.00SGD for a can of coke. This price continued to the pool and also bars. As such we only ordered once poolside as 6 cokes at $7.00!!!! This was a shame as we usually indulge in pool snacks and beverages when away. Breakfast at PP was lovely and so much to choose from. Always very busy and ALL the staff there deserve a pat on the back as the food was great. My only complaint here was when your plate was removed they left your dirty knife and fork behind for further use. We could not see clean cuttlery on display so were forced to go from savoury to sweet with the same utensils. Pool was large, warm and the underwater music a novelty. Pool lounge chairs readily avalable and staff bring over bottles of water. Gym was suitable, clean and adequate number of equipment available.

The gym is well equipped. Best of all is the location - since my last visit the SMRT (Circle Line) has opened two stations, one either side of the hotel, Esplanade and Promenade. This is a connection line between Dhoby Ghaut and Paya Lebar Interchanges. If you wanted to you could catch the MRT to/from Changi Airport, but I would not suggest it with other than carry on luggage - besides taxi's are cheap in Singapore. The hotel is next to Suntec Convention centre - which has a great food court, as well as the Marina Square Shopping Centre and Millenia Walk, with many many more connected. Concierge staff were knowledgeable when asked some very specific questions regarding venues. The hotel room was well equipped with excellent AV connections for iPod, PC etc, as well as all cables supplied. There is also a universal AC plug on the desktop for PC/Phone recharging. Even though I have my own local 3G Sim Card for using the net, the hotel has excellent Wifi coverage, as well as LAN connection in room.

Close to metro/mall/business district/Marina bay sands/casino 2) Great lobby..larger than life look 3) Amazing bubble lifts. Moving from ground floor to the top floor is sightseeing in itself ! 4) Very well maintained swimming pool. The highlight was when you go underwater there is soothing music playing. Just brillant 5) Argubly one of the best Indian resturants in Singapore - Rang Mahal 6) Good room layout and decent size bathrooms 7) Excellent view from the room. Recommend taking a high floor 8) Staff are well trained and look cheerful most of the time 9) Awesome roof top resturant. Must try 10) Most tour operators stop at this place for pick up Cons 1) A bit on the expensive side during peak season 2) Since th hotel is popular with both business and holiday travellers they could work on reducing the waiting time during check in Its the real 5-star in singapore.

We were exhausted after a long flight from Paris, so we were delighted to have hot showers and be able to rest about 6 hours before we expected to check in! We had booked a deluxe room with view and were on the 22nd floor with amazing views of the Harbour, Merlion and Singapore flyer. The room was spacious and clean. Beds very comfortable, and the automated shutters and blinds make the room dark and quiet for sleeping. We spent a bit of time by the pool which is lovely and towels, cold bottled water and fruit are provided. The hotel is connected to Marina Square shopping centre and close to Suntec City shopping centre. MRT stations are not far...you can walk through the shopping centre to get to Esplanade station. We ate at the Asian Restaurant on the top floor which has amazing views and wonderful service. Rather expensive as you would expect with such a view and the food was OK...nothing special. Our favourite bar was the Japanese style bar where they had a great happy hour deal...S$9.99 for drinks from 5.30pm each day. The barman is great and makes a divine peach Sakatini! We were also lucky to get a later check out as we had an evening flight...it's subject to availability but worth asking. We will definately return to Pan Pacific Singapore in the future, and this hotel deserves it's high rating on Trip Adviser.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vevey, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "Petsko", "ReviewID": "UR113354477", "Content": "perfectly located and a great swimming pool area. also nice & quiet rooms.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cSix stars all the way!\u201d", "Author": "HappiestTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR113303859", "Content": "I have never felt so spoiled and well looked after at a hotel, if there were an option here for more than 5 stars then Pan Pacific would get it!

Starting from the phone reservation team; I was facing some difficulty in making a room reservation hence tried calling the toll-free hotline for assistance. I was put through a very polite & friendly officer within 3mins. Unlike some hotels (5*/4*), their hotline kept me waiting and some even cut the line off after a long 15mins wait! Check in experience: all the staff @ reception were so approachable with their warm smiles. The lady who attended to me asked if this is my first visit to them. She happened to know that my stay was to celebrate for my wedding anniversary & shortly after settling into the room with stunning harbour view, my hubby & I had 2 surprises! A friendly manager (which I believe is from guest relations) came & checked if everything's fine so far.. and then we were greeted by another staff who delivered over a yummy anniversary cake! Special arrangement by the hotel :) Spacious room area. Loves the bathroom for its separate bathtub & standing shower facilities. Dining (breakfast) experience: as we stayed in the executive king room, we were offered the choice to have our breakfast @ the Bering Suite. Though the spread are not impressive but it's still acceptable. Hope to see more choices in our next stay! Location: Extremely accessible as the hotel connects to Marina Sq & Suntec City shopping malls. The only problem is that if one drives, you might have difficulty finding a parking lot nearest to the hotel lobby. Perhaps the hotel can look into this by working with the Carpark Mgmt to allocate certain lots to strictly hotel guests only. Overall: The only complain I have is the lift.. the waiting time is long despite there are 4-5 in service concurrently. Other than this, thumbs up! The hotel are blessed to have a team of friendly staffs who extend excellent service & makes guests 'feel at home'.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant service sets this hotel apart\u201d", "Author": "ClareandTrav", "ReviewID": "UR112814443", "Content": "My husband and I first stayed at this property 10 years ago on our honeymoon and loved it.

The bags were delivered promptly by one of the super efficient team and when we finally got to sleep, after marvelling at the great nightime view from our balcony, the comfortable bed meant we got a great sleep and were ready to explore this vibrant city.

This was our 4th family holiday to Singapore in the past 8 years. On all other occasions we stayed at the Merchant Court (another great family hotel). For a couple of reason we decided to at the Pan Pacific on this holiday rather that the Merchant Court. I was a little apprehensive about changing hotels, as I am one that likes to know what to expect from my hotel and surrounds when on holiday. I can say, it was one of the best decisions we have made as a family regarding our holiday planning. From the time we walk got out of the taxi, until we left 14 days later we were made to feel at home. We completed the online guest preferences / details form and they had already completed all the quest paperwork for the two rooms we had booked for our staff. On arrival we be taken directly upto and shown the rooms. We had interconnecting rooms on the 16th floor looking back towards the Conrad Hotel, while not directly overlook the Marina Bay the views will still very pleasant and enjoyable. The rooms were large and clean, the bathroom's were excellent. The room the kids had a seperate bath and shower which was few handy at times. Our room had a slightly different layout of the bathroom with the bath and shower together. The overhead shower head was excellent and was one of the best showers in any hotel I have stayed. The rooms were kept clean and tidy each day, the maids were friendly and always polite and went out of there way to help with the kids with any questions they had. We enjoyed breakfast each morning the the Global Kitchen which offered an extensive buffet of both hot and cold foods from around the world in a very relaxed atmosphere. A great start to the day. By the 5th morning the staff greet the family by name which was a great personal touch and made the kids feel welcome. One several occasions after spending the 15+ hours exploring Singapore we ordered from the Room Service Menu, the service was always prompt and the food was of good quality and high standards and best of all for room service it was always delivered to the room hot. The prices for room service were very reasonable and the serving quite large. The pool area and gym were excellent. The staff and poolside service were friendly and excellent and offered a free bottle of water when you arrived to the pool. It never seemed to be over crowed and was a great place at the end of day seeing the sights of Singapore to sit, relax and have a cold beer while the kids when for a swim. The closest MRT station is the Promenade MRT Station which is a 2-3 minute walk (undercover) from the Hotel. This makes gettings around Singapore very convenient and easy. Best of all there is a Starbucks between the MRT Station and the Hotel. The overall location is great, with Suntec City next to the Hotel, several large shopping malls connected to the Hotel and withing walking distance to the Flyer, Helix Bridge and the Boat / Clarke Quay areas. Lastly, all the staff that we interacted with were friendly, helpful and went out of their way to help with our queries. Service was always with a smile. Overall I would recommend the Pan Pacific to family's traveling to Singapore want a convenient and relaxing hotel.

Hasten to say that I was given an enormous surprise upon checking in when I was given an upgrade of two categories (from Panorama) to the wonderful Pacific Club. Taking a glass elevator to the dedicated check-in on the 33rd floor, I was informed of the many benefits of the Pacific Club - free Internet, free dry cleaning of two clothing items, late 1500 check-out, complimentary mini-bar (not alcohol) and free snacks at the 24 hour Sunrise Bar. Upon entering the room, it appeared to have a nicer and warmer decor than the rooms on the lower levels of the hotel. The hotel's usual benefits of a wonderfully comfortable bed, a great range of interior lighting and electronic blinds were on offer, but the bathroom contained some delightful extras: L\u2019Occitane toiletries, and a shower with water that gushed from six showerheads directed at different portions of the body. At dusk, one could head to the Sunset Bar on the 34th floor to enjoy complimentary drinks with hors d\u2019oeuvres and canap\u00e9s. Apart from the sometimes spectacular sunsets over the city, laser light shows are held at the Marina Bay Sands at 2000 and 2130 and the view from the Sunset Bar of this spectacle is magnificent. For those wanting photographs, just walk down a level via the internal staircase to the Sunrise Bar for an equally good view from the balcony where one is not hindered by glass reflections. The food at the Pan Pacific is very good - eating breakfast in the Sunrise Bar is a small and intimate affair and the selection on offer is reasonable but not comprehensive. I'm sure the larger restaurants downstairs would have more variety. Room service was extremely efficient as well, and the quality of the food again was superior. The best aspect of the Pan Pacific is its staff - it is a rare for a large hotel to retain such personal service despite its large size. The employees here seem genuine and warm, unlike some large hotels where such interaction can be described as cool or aloof. The staff at the Pacific Club were exceptional, and the check-in was the best I\u2019ve ever experienced \u2013 happy, welcoming and warm. Because we needed to leave the hotel late (2200) to head to the airport, we were allowed to remain in the Sunrise Bar after the 1500 checkout. At around dusk, the person in charge of the Sunset Bar suggested that we return there for another round of free canap\u00e9s and a complimentary drink even though we had already checked out. This was yet another example of the excellent service I received during my visit to the Pan Pacific. Staying at the hotel is expensive, so I try to book as early as possible and time my stay for the weekend to obtain the cheapest possible Advance Purchase Rate. If flying Singapore Airlines, you can book the Pan Pacific as part of their Singapore Stopover program which is the cheapest price on offer and it even includes return airport transfers. I particularly love the location of this hotel in the Marina area as I'm not a fan of Orchard Road. Suntec Plaza, City Link and Marina Square are nearby and there are plenty of shopping and dining options contained within. The Marina area is the most picturesque in Singapore so there are plenty of places for an evening stroll.

This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in, I didn't want to leave and I really want to go back asap. It is relatively central, and you can easily walk to the other areas such as Clarke Quay. As soon as we arrived, we were treated really well by the staff - we had just finished a backpacking tour of China so you can imagine we weren't looking too smart, but they treated us as if we were royalty. As the taxi pulled up, the doors were opened for us and our luggage taken. This was delivered to our room, and they even fixed my boyfriend's hat that he'd broken, without us even asking. Check in was very fast and easy. The foyer is amazing, it's beautiful in a modern way, with a bar in the middle (which serves amazing blueberry cocktails!) and futuristic lifts. Our room was amazing, we paid a little extra for a good view and it was well worth it. In fact, the amount we ended up paying for such a nice room is the equivalent of what you'd pay for a very standard room in London. The window was floor to ceiling with electronic blinds that can be controlled from the bed (or wherever in the room) with a remote control. The bed was huge, and SO comfortable. There was a flatscreen tv and a desk also. The bathroom was large, with sinks and a bath, and then separate shower and toilet cubicles. The hotel is linked to a couple of shopping centres so you can stay in the air conditioning all the way to the shops! We only ate in the hotel once, at the Indian. It was very nicely decorated, and the food was lovely too. We didn't go in the pool but sat by it, and it is a nice area. As soon as we sat down, we were offered towels and complimentary water. My boyfriend used the gym in the hotel and thought it was well equipped and well staffed - the staff offer you apples, water and towels.

I had asked my travel agent to book me on this one. I got the deluxe room with balcony. 1. Lovely location - Placed very closed to the singapore flyer and marine square and suntec malls. 2. On arrival the lady at the entrance and arrival desk were very polite and helpful 3. The rooms were plush, clean and so well maintained... with amazing bathroom accessories and the view from my room was simply superb. I had a room with a balcony and a view of the singapore flyer 4. I had free wifi coursty a free membership to a club which the arrival desk would brief the guest. 5. Breakfast spread was awesome ! i think each every country was represented on that breakfast table :) if i can put it that way. Food quality was amazing and service was prompt 6. The hotel has a connecting entrance to the suntec mall and marine square which makes it very convinient. 7. The check out formality took just 30 secs which was by the quickest i have had. I think overall this is by far the best hotel i have stayed in terms of service quality and room architechture. i was only unfortunate to have missed out on the pool as i was out most of the time on my execursions.

We did go & have alook at the Swissotel MC & was not as impressed with the location as we were with the PP. Each day upon leaving or entering the PP we were made to feel so important especially Marielle who is a lovely person & always walked us to or from the lifts when she saw us coming asking about our day & offering advice when asked. We had asked for a high floor & received the 32nd. Lovely well presented room with great views although this side perhaps not as best as overlooking the Singapore Flyer on the other side as we overlooked the Hilton side. Large flat screen TV, plenty of lighting, the block out electric blinds are fantastic, bathrobes & slippers provided. Jug, cups & glasses along with tea & coffee Paper on door each morning. Large bathroom with shower & bath separate & beautifully presented. One of my complaints & we have found this with a number of hotels is the bedding. While all was comfortable there is NO top sheet only a very hot doona. Why do some hotels not provide a top sheet is beyond us especially in such hot climate a top sheet is most welcoming as we conserved energy & only had the a/c @ a comfortable 23deg so the doona on top was way too hot. A phone call to housekeeping rectified the isssue & we could now sleep with a top sheet. Our only other complaint is the fridge. These are the sensor type fridges & if you move an item & not replace it within 30sec it will be charged back to your account. We knew how expensive wine was in Singapore so we bought our own & had to really juggle the wine in without moving the contents but upon a survey we conducted with the PP after we arrived home we were told we would have been able to have the fridge emptied & that any future reservations these two issues would be in place.Thank you Jennifer nice to know. The location to this hotel is perfect. The Marina Square shopping SC is attached to the Pan & for walking to MRT's this is excellent as all under cover in a/c comfort.. Out the front door to the nearest MRT which is the Promanade station & a mere 5min walk. We took advice of other TA's & bought the Ezylink card to ride the MRT . Taxis are cheap & plentiful just watch your peak hours & after midnight when fares go up. We are unable to comment on dining @ the PP as we ate elsewhere.

For me the Pan Pacific is a first rate hotel. It's spotlessly clean, and really quite elegant on the inside with a full height atrium all the way up the core of the building. The rooms are a good size and the beds very comfortable. We found the in room dining to be interesting but not quite up to the quality you find normally in Singapore (food here is truly awesome!). That said the in-hotel restaurants are very good, the Japanese one especially is well worth a visit. The staff are really very friendly and helpful.

Really, it was very impressive and reassuring when you're away from home. Also when using the gym, or the pool there was always someone there to hand you a towel or a bottle of water. One thing I should say, it's worth knowing that if you go wandering into the nearby malls and MRT train stations you shouldn't go down to the lobby floor (floor 1) unless you plan to take a cab. If you're walking then the best way to go is floor 2 where there are two exits which take you straight into the Marina Square mall, Suntec mall, or Millenia Walk mall. The two nearest MRT stations, Esplanade and Promenade are directly accessible from Suntec and Millenia Walk respectively.

The rooms are really large and ultra luxurious (we had booked the regular rooms) with huge bay windows from floor to ceiling giving a spectacular views from the 32nd Floor that we were on. One could see the Singapore Eye the new Marina Bay Casino and Hotel and the Singapore skyline clearly. The room has everything that a family or business traveller would need wifi, cable internet, minibar, Large LCD TV, all sorts of connectors and cables (including HDMI), huge bed - basically the works For the shopaholic and gastronome the location is fantastic with the hotel directly connecting to the Marina Bay mall and with all the great other malls and restaurants within a short walking distance. Overall we had a great time at the Hotel and would recommend it highly to anyone travelling on business or pleasure to Singapore.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cCleanliness not up to standard\u201d", "Author": "Jenferlau", "ReviewID": "UR106586016", "Content": "the most disgusting part from our stay in this hotel is to use the room phones.

I could only ask the staff who sent the rollaway bed to us to clean the phones. But guess what, he first tried to use a dry cloth to wipe them. I told him it wouldn't work. Then he decided to wet the cloth, but you can imagine it would not make it any better. So at the end, the phones were never cleaned and every time I used them, I had to hold my breath. Then the toilet seat was never cleaned thoroughly. The same stain on the toilet seat stayed there throughout our whole stay. Then, the cold water tap on the basin leaks water.

Check in was quite slow as I arrived right on check-in time and it seemed everyone else did too. I found it tiring standing in line until it was my turn, however when my turn finally arrived it didn't take long. My bags were swiftly delivered to my room. The room was lovely and spotlessly clean. Was lucky enough to get a wonderful view of the marina area. My only problem was that the bed was too firm for me, however that is a very personal preference which in no way detracts from the quality of the room. The rain shower was great with good pressure and hot water. Housekeeping was very efficient and everything was replenished when necessary - nothing forgotten. I also like the fact that I could choose to reuse my bedding and towels instead of having them changed every day. I try to be environmentally conscious and it is ridiculous to have the sheets changed every day when I'm the only one sleeping in the bed! I was on the 31st Floor and, like other reviewers have mentioned, there was some noise. Occasionally I could hear the music from the live performers in the atrium and I could also hear the street traffic. I was surprised by this as I was so high up, however, it wasn't loud and didn't bother me. I had my breakfast in the Bering Suite and the spread was perfectly adequate for me. Eggs could be cooked to order and there was a good choice of other hot and cold breakfast items. I also had a cold drink there at around 5.30 pm and the appetisers and snacks were nice also. The staff were very attentive and it was a pleasant place to have a relaxed breakfast and read the paper. The staff, overall, were very friendly and helpful. I didn't eat in the hotel restaurants as the location is excellent for eating out. The hotel is attached to Marina Square Mall with lots of eateries and there are numerous other ones all around the area. For those with children who may not be very adventurous eaters, Marina Square has Subway, Burger King, MacDonalds, KFC, as well as lots of other western and asian eateries. Suntec City is also accessible by a walkover from Marina Square and there is a great foodcourt there with very reasonably priced meals. All in all I had a great stay at the Pan Pacific. I would definitely stay again if I could find a way to make the bed a bit softer. I think I will contact them next time before I book and see if they provide a mattress topper for situations such as this.

This was my husband and I's first trip to Singapore. We were both on business for part of the time and vacation the other. We used Singapore as a base and returned to this hotel on several occasions. Our issues were the following: 1. Music in the lobby drifts up to all the rooms and is very loud.We stayed on the 5th and 12th floors and it kept us up on both. Impossible to sleep. Not to mention that listening to a lobby singer and pianist sing \"Poker Face\" by Lady Gaga is just wrong. My husband had meetings starting at 730 am, so we called down around 11pm to ask if the volume could be lowered and what time the music finished. The volume was not lowered and we were told 1145pm. At midnight we were still not sleeping and the music was still playing, so we called down again. We were told that the music would now be playing until around 1230am-1am. There were not more than 6 people on the entire bar/sitting area in the lobby at that time. The music finally finished at 1230am and we slept well after that. It is just very frustrating to pay $300+ per night to stay at a \"5 star\" hotel, to have them play loud music in the lobby that prevents it's guests from sleeping. Overall, I felt this was very disrespectful and our concerns were definitely not addressed. Perhaps we should have been more forceful in our complaints, but this is not our nature... 2. Upon check-in for the third time in 2 weeks, we were told that there was no room available for us and we would have to wait approximately 2 hours before one would become available. This was at 145pm in the afternoon!!! Meanwhile we watched as multiple other guests were given rooms. Perhaps given that it was our third time in 3 weeks at the hotel, they could have upgraded us, given us the room we had booked, or at the very least offered at complimentary drink at the bar while we waited?!? I can understand having to wait if checking in early, but given that check-in is 2pm and we were only 15 mins early, why we should have to wait TWO hours is beyond me. We decided to leave the hotel as we had no room and asked them to call us when the room became available. By 530pm we had still not received a call, but needed to shower and get ready for dinner, as we had a work-related dinner. The room was available by that time, just no one had bothered to notify us even though we had specifically asked them to and given them our cell phone number. Again, as usual for this Pan Pacific, no apology given. 3. The seals on several of the toiletries had been broken by previous guests (?used) and just left by housekeeping rather than being replaced. Fortunately they actually had seals that we could see were broken, so we did not use them. 4. Location is slightly out of the way. A bit of a walk to Clarke Quay, Orchard, Little India. In general this is not a problem as cabs are super cheap, but as anyone who's been to Singapore knows, if it rains or is rush hour it can be VERY difficult to get a taxi, with long lines at the taxi stands. I truly wish we had stayed in a slightly more central location, especially given the complete lack of service at this hotel. We have stayed at many true 5 star hotels all over the world, including on this trip and unfortunately the Pan Pacific in Singapore is really not up to par at all.The rooms/lobby are nice enough and the bed comfortable, but unfortunately that doesn't make up for the above problems with service, etc. For the price, you would be much better off at the Hyatt, Fairmont or Mandarin. Thankfully we had no further reservations at the Pan Pacific after these three stays for multiple nights and could FINALLY switch to another hotel closer to Orchard for the remaining 3 weeks of our time in Singapore. If you are used to business travel, I would definitely NOT stay at this hotel. Perhaps if on vacation, being kept up late, having delayed check-ins, etc, would not be so bothersome to your schedule, but I still think there are much better places to stay in Singapore.", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely a must stay\u201d", "Author": "Ivertee", "ReviewID": "UR103659099", "Content": "The things I liked about the hotel were: 1.

Ask for masseuse called Sand..she is out of this world. 5.Really friendly and accomodating staff. 6.Late checkout option plus 1 hour access to courtesy room for rest/shower after cheking out. 7. Mouthwatering breakfast menu:Japanese/Chinese/Middle Eastern/Indian/Continental. Seemed pricey at first glance but given how expensive Singapore is was good value for money (20\u00a3 per person). Breakfast costs less if delivered to room. Things I did not like: Housekeeping often reluctant to return late afternoon to clean the room if you choose to have a lie-in (remember UK 7 hours behind so you will struggle to wake up in the mornings).

We have been friends since we were 17. So i have been emailing Pan Pacific prior to my check in checking on my reservation details, and each time i email them,the response i get is usually around 5-10 minutes. My reservation experience made me feel reassured that Pan Pacific is efficient. Melody from Level 1 arrival desk was friendly and she accompanied me to Level 33 for check in at Pacific Club. Grace from Pacific Club was efficient handling my check in, and she brought me to my room. Upon reaching there,we met Judd and David, and David offered me an upgrade to Loft Suite at an additional price. The whole arrival experience was fast and exciting and Grace, Judd and David made me feel so warm and welcome the moment I met them. I celebrated my boyfriend's 24th birthday and our 23 months together at Pan Pacific Singapore, and being upgraded to loft suite with the sauna and jacuzzi with the most amazing view of sg flyer and mbs with all the other buildings was too surreal. Judd and David gave me wonderful surprises during my stay, including arranging a 1kg rum and raisin cheescake for my boyfriend and delivering it to our room and singing birthday song for my boyfriend with Jayrick and Jevy, and decorating our room with orchid and rose petals with beutiful stalks of roses, with a trail of orchid petals from our room door right up to the staircase and to the 2nd floor , right up to the wonderful big bed which is so comfortable i felt like i was sleeping on air..and petals of orchid and roses in our shower area, the jacuzzi..and they also included my blue balloons which i blew up for my boyfriend in the decoration. David and Velicia were so cute! Thank you Velicia for decorating our room so beautifully...i couldnt have asked for more..Thank you David for arranging all of these.. I wanted to decorate the room but all i had were blue balloons hehe! Thank you Judd for always being there with a big big smile and arranging all these for us too!!! We still had the rum and raisin cheesecake from the day before and wanted to finish it ,so when we left our room for check out,we met David and he brought us to Sunrise and David and Judd prepared tea for us while we finished our cake..During departure, Jayrick was efficient in handling my check out, and Judd and David were telling us about the other rooms in Pacific Club and the distance they go for guests's best experience.. I was sad to leave Pacific Club and the wonderful team there but my boyfriend and i are already planning to go back there again and book harbour suite on the next trip! Pacific Club in Pan Pacific Singapore really have personalized service for each guest. Judd, David, Grace, Jayrick, Jevy and Velicia helped me make my boyfriend's 24th birthday and our 23 months together an experience truly unforgettable and memorable. They gave us a 1kg birthday cake, they decorated our room with beautiful flowers, they made us feel so happy with their attention and they really took care of us during our stay. The constant available food in Pacific Club Lounge is the best. I have never seen any other hotel have an open pantry like that before. Pacific Club is the best place to be. Im so happy Pan Pacific Singapore has Pacific Club! =) On a very important note, Pacific Club Lounge is so calm and peaceful to have our meals there. Complete with a stunning view of the city and mbs and flyer and everything else, theres nothing like sipping sweet rich hot chocolate with the sunday papers just basking in the company of a loved one. Sunrise is really peaceful.. just good food and silence and the view..and the service and friendly staff.. Judd is always with a big smile and he looks so happy and I feel so warm and welcomed and he sang birthday song for my boyfriend with cake from Pacific Club and he made me the most sweetest richest hot chocolate for breakfast at Sunrise! If it wasnt for David who offered me an upgrade to Loft Suite, i wouldnt experience the sauna and jacuzzi right in the comfort of my own room ..David arranged for a 1kg cake for my boyfriend and he with Judd,Jayrick and Jevy sang birthday song for my boyfriend when they delivered it personally..Velicia put in alot of effort decorating our loft suite with orchid and rose petals and stalks of roses...It made our weekend so beautiful..Grace and Jayrick during check in and check out were so efficient ..The Pacific Club team with the constant food from Pacific Club Lounge is what personalized service and memorable experiences are all about...They are the reason why we will come back again =) My only intention was to surprise my boyfriend with Pacific Club and the gorgeous view of the city and night lights that it offers...but Pacific Club surprised both me and my boyfriend tremendously throughout our stay in so many ways from our room to the food to the service . I never expected such good service but it really leaves a lasting impression on me. Thank you again Judd, David, Grace, Jayrick, Jevy, Velicia and the whole Pacific Club team. Thank you for making our experience so beautiful and memorable. I really cant wait to be back at Pacific Club again. It truly feels like a holiday well spent. My boyfriend has been wanting to stay at Pan Pacific on the highest floor ever since he was a boy..and the iconic lifts outside of the building which looks so beautiful at night.. I really cant thank Judd David Grace Jayrick Jevy Velicia enough. They work so well together to give guests the best experience.

I booked this hotel after seeing the reviews on Trip Advisor. To start with we were greeted very warmly by a person by the name Marie Lee when we arrived. She seemed to be the most warm person around in the whole the hotel. She guided us well and took us to the arrival desk inside the hotel. Arrival desk was full so she sent us to the departure desk of the hotel to get fast check - in done. Arrival formalities was fast but wasnt warm enough by the lady on the other side of the desk. Before booking our room at the hotel we requested for an room with a good view and king size bed from the hotel reservation at the arrival hall in Terminal 2 Changi airport. We were given room no 1604 which didnt have good views either. The room was big, but wasnt very modern. It looked like refurbished one at low cost. Minibar was out of order and completely empty. There was only one bottle of water. Found it strange and vague and I was completely dissapointed with the housekeeping. Housekeeping - They didnt clean the room well next day after we came back from an excursion. Bottles of water werent refilled or changed and trash was also lying on the floor. I had booked in this hotel after reviews on tripadvisor and felt even more disspointed. Something just wasnt right with this place. Pool had cold water and if you swim, you can hear the music inside the pool. That was great. On level 2 there was an exit to shopping centre which was quite cool. Marina square has many cheap brands and great place to shop in Singapore. However, I think Ion on Orchard Road is a better place to shop and eat in Singapore. However, I think this hotel needs to improve quite a lot specially on the customer service front. We had paid sing dollar 330 / night and it quite didnt meet our expectations. Not a good value for money. While checking out - the staff at the departure desk wasnt very attentive either.

We were there for Valentines Day but all Singapore was still in the post Chinese New Year Celebrations so there was not much an ado about the Valentines Day. My only slight concern with the hotel was the Minibar. They have an electronic register in their minibars that automatically adds the cost of the drink to your room bill if one is removed from the minibar for more than 30 seconds. the problem with that is that there is no room in the minibar for you to put your own bottle of wine or anything else larger than a small bottle of water (laid down). If they had slightly larger minibars, or had some space in there for your own bottle of wine or something, it would be excellent. The Pan Pac is perfectly located between Esplanade and Promenade MRT stations, so going anywhere on the extensive subway network is quite easy. The only downside is that if you get back late in the evening you cannot normally go through the Esplanade shopping Center and over the walkway to the hotel as security has it all locked up, so you need to walk round the street and through the front door of the hotel. They do have a GHA Discovery Loyalty program which I signed up for on the internet weeks in advance of our trip but this was not availed to us as described [The GHA Discovery benefits associated with your membership tier can be enjoyed on your first stay.] in the welcome email so we missed out on that, but I guess on your first stay they are only nominal benefits, so we weren't too disappointed.

Upon checking in, I asked whether it was possible to check in early - the answer was no, as they were fully booked and still awaiting guests to check out, but they (Raymond) offered me a \"hospitality room\" which allowed me to freshen up. This was followed shortly by checking me in ASAP to an available room. I was very appreciative of this. During the stay, staff were polite, and always helpful. 5 days later, when it was time to leave, I had a 6 hour wait between checking out and leaving for the airport. I tried my luck again to see if staff could help me out re: a hospitality room for an hour, they (Ryan this time) couldn't guarantee me anything; but promised to do whatever he could once I return from sight-seeing.

Close to a large shopping centre which you can get access through the hotel. The shopping centre leads you onto the Marina and also to the nearest MRT stations which is a great way to get around. It just took us a few days to find our way around so it might be better to ask at the desk to save yourself time. We upgraded to an executive room not sure this benefited us really as I am gluten free and when I asked for gluten free nibbles I was told No. We had just come from KL and had stayed in a club room at the Traders they had no problem making gluten free food for me. That was a 4 star hotel this is a 5 star so expected the same service if not better was shocked that I didn't get it. This is one of my gripes with this hotel but I have since complained and been assured they would accomodate me in the future. I suppose I should of emailed them ahead to warn them but again you would of thought a 5 star hotel could cope with such a request. The exec rooms were lovely no complaints really clean, spacious and a lovely bathroom. All the mod cons infact that mod that you need a degree to understand how to use them. There is a user guide in the room so good luck!!! I rang and asked them and they were up to the room in no time giving assistance. We did have breakfast in the global kitchen one morning plenty to choose from you may have to queue until they take your room number so avoid busy times!!!! We had great views from the hotel as we over looked the marina bay sands hotel and marina. The pool looked great but it wasnt warm enough for us to visit, besides we spent most of our time shopping. Shopping is good in singapore prefered the malls down orchard road but the shoppin centre close by is not bad. Little India is worth a visit you must go to a shop called mustafas is a large shop full of anything and everything a real eye opener. I also bought myself some 22 carat cold earrings from one of the jewelry shops there a must have. The zoo was awsome and thats saying something coming from Oz and been local to australia zoo which takes some beating. We did not do the night safari but they say its good I have heard that it can be hard to hear or understand the commentry though. Taxies are also a good way to get around not too expensive but can be hard to get during peak times. No problem picking them up from the hotel lobby only takes 15 mins to airport. If you can visit the marina bay sands hotel do so. There is a casino there which is probably worth a visit but they will only let you in if you show them your passport. We didnt carry it on us for security reasons so never got in. I understand you can go to the top deck of the hotel free but we were given the wrong directions and never actually made it. Still it must be worth a look for the views. Didn't do sentosa island this time sounds like its more for families as its a theme park with rides people we do know who went said it was not worth it. So look into it make sure the rides are open as many were not. We do not do rides so no good to us. All in all we love Singapore the hotel was nice but we didnt get as good a service as we got in Traders in KL. Maybe I am wrong to say that we did get a good efficient service but coming from KL I compared it and didn't feel the same welcoming. In KL the staff were much more friendlier and our stay was made special. Didn't get the same feeling in the Pan Pacific.

We called Service One twice in ten minutes, and were told they would contact housekeeping and call back, but we received no response..... the bed finally arrived after midnight. To us it's obvious the hotel has serious management problems. Though we weren't charged for the extra bed upon checking out, we'd simply much rather not have to go to the hassle instead. I also had an awful experience at breakfast at Global Kitchen. The buffet's rocket salad was clearly unwashed, with sand and red mud in it. It seems dangerously unprofessional to serve food in such a state - we've never had a similar experience elsewhere. We later received a box of chocolates and a card with an apology from the restaurant manager, and appreciate the gesture, but regardless, we expect it will never happen again.

The atrium resembles similar architecture to that of the Marriott Marquis in New York City. Check-in was easy. However, we were given one room on the 14th floor and one room on the 7th floor even though we had requested both rooms in close proximity. We would have liked them to be on the same floor. The rooms were large with modern d\u00e9cor and featured a flatscreen LCD television and remote-controlled drapes. There was also free wifi. The bathroom was extremely spacious with a separate shower stall and bathtub as well as toilet area. There were plenty of toiletries and soft towels. Breakfast was served at the Global Kitchen Restaurant, which was delicious and included many Asian and American choices. The Dim Sum options and soup/noodle bar were nice additions. My favorite parts about the hotel were the outdoor swimming pool, gym, and tennis courts. The pool was amazing and made the Conrad Pool next-door look like a kiddie pool. The staff at both the pool and gym anticipated my every need. I also appreciated that the gym had a fully stocked supply of bottled water. In addition, it was refreshing to have fresh fruit offered to me after my workout. Overall, my family really enjoyed the Pan Pacific and found very little to fault. The staff seemed attentive, helpful, and happy. The hotel location in Marina Bay is a great alternative to staying on the chaotic Orchard Road.

This is a big, modern hotel with disappointing decore in the reception and main lobby areas (big red chairs everywhere, blue carpet). Throughout the hotel, you see mostly cement and concrete which rendered the hotel absolutely no character. Overall, boring is the word that comes to mind. Check in: We arrived to the hotel after 4 pm, room still wasn't ready. Requested two beds at time of booking (long time ago), but were offered a king room instead- which wasn't going to work. Check in staff sent us to the small coffee shop/bar in the lobby, ordered us drinks and promised to come get us once room was available. No one ever showed up. After waiting for a long while we approached the receptionist again and she simply said that the room is ready! The room: Modern, nice decore, a little on the small side with two small twin beds (hard as a rock). There's coffee/tea making machine and a flat screen TV with several cables in the darwer to hook up just about any electronic device you may have. There's free wifi but getting the connection to work was quite an ordeal, every single night. Bathroom: huge, clean, with separate toilet and shower stalls, bath tub, plenty of toiletries, soft towels, bathrobes, slippers, etc. Location: Excellent, by the buzzing Marina Bay area, Singapore amazing skyline, etc. Hotel is adjacent to two shopping centers, subway, and infinite dining options. You could walk anywhere weather permitting. Breakfast: The included buffet breakfast was nothing to write home about. Global Kitchen restaurant seemed depressing with no windows (despite the stunning views outside). Ventilation is poor which made the smell of different foods that were being prepared very overpowering. Tried breakfast once and didn't repeat it. Service: Staff are really nice (except for the guy who checked us in who didn't seem to be enjoying his job).

Aircon is good, no smell, but a bit too cold even I set it on 27 degree celcius, so finally turn it off at about 3am. The mall which connected to the hotel is not as bad as I suppose. The marina square is big enough, lots of shop and food you can try. If it's not rain you can walk to marina bay sands. There is a nice bridge that you can walk along, also near to Singapore flyer, but don't have time to ride Singapore flyer. Promenade MRT is only a few hundred meters walk (about 300m) also can go to Suntec convention centre through marina square. If you got heavy rain outside but want to walk further then go to citylink mall and it will bring you to Esplanade or City Hall MRT (Raffles City).

The location is also good, and the best exit is through the mall down to the water front. This can be a bit tricky the first night, we got a bit lost before we actually made it out.

This one is on Raffles Bvd. and the other one is on Orchard Road - some distance away. We chose this for our return trip to Singapore on our way home to Australia. I organised it myself on the internet. If you do this you can get yourself a very nice package with options of airport pickup by private car, breakfast, late check out etc.and pay on arrival/departure. I opted for breakfast and late checkout as our flight was late evening. We were not expecting a great welcome as we arrived early am (7ish). However, the reception asked us to wait an hour for our room and sure enough it was available within that time. You often forget that the worst part of travelling - particularly on the long haul trips is that you might arrive several hours before the hotel can accommodate you and you are left to wander off and find something to do or collapse in the nearest chair to the reception desk in the hope that your constant presence will remind them you are still 'homeless'. Arriving early and finding your room available is a bonus. The rooms are not big but we had stayed at the Ritz Carlton on the way to the UK and I think this compares very well with that hotel and actually provides more in value. OK, we didn't have a view but do you spend your holiday looking out of a window? Dusk comes quickly in Asia anyway and the curtains are soon closed and the view is gone. One of the absolute bonuses of this hotel is that you have access to several malls without having to walk outside in the heat. Follow the signs for the shops and you can walk all the way to the Raffles Mall underground: must be about 4 or 5 km. So, one might say that this hotel is a shopper's paradise if you have a burning itch to spend money. The hotel amenities are reasonable: there is a very good gym which gives access to the swimming pool. Staff available if you have problems with the equipment etc. The downstairs bar is a little small but given the price of alcohol in Singapore you might not want to stay there all night anyway. Breakfast tends towards the Asian diet rather than the Western one but there again - lots of choice with personally cooked orders by available chefs. We enjoyed a late check out until 3pm and nobody disturbed us before then. In fact in the 32 hours we stayed at this hotel nobody bothered us at all which is a big improvement on the usual knocks on the door from housekeeping. Meantime, the bed was made and towels provided - all during our short excursions from the room. I would definitely return here again.

We had two rooms, one for my husband and I and one for our two teenagers. We booked standard rooms but paid an extra SGD50 per room per night for the Executive Business Privileges package. This entitled us to breakfast in the business lounge, free internet and complimentary drinks and snacks all day as well as a few other business related things that we didn't use. Complimentary wine, beer and spirits was provided from 5.30pm until 8.00pm. The Executive Business Privileges package was worth every penny to us. The buffet breakfast was superb, with everything you could wish for available, including an egg chef. We often passed the main breakfast room in the lift and could see long queues each morning, but there was never any wait in the business lounge. The internet was a valuable inclusion as we took two lap tops and internet access was quite expensive in the hotel. The main benefit for us though, was the pre-dinner drinks. We love a drink before dinner on holidays and as wine is quite expensive in Singapore this was great value for money. There was a large range of brand name spirits, as well as a variety of bottle wines and beers. The snacks were also very, very good. We expected chips and nuts, which were certainly there, but there was also half a dozen different hot snacks each evening, together with a cheese board and various other bits and pieces. All were of very good quality and the service was fantastic. The only danger was not leaving enough room for dinner! The business lounge was quite attractive, on the 22nd floor, and had good views of Singapore from the windows and adjacent balcony. The rest of the hotel was as good as the previous reviews say. The location is perfect for shopping and sightseeing. The hotel has a range of restaurants but we only ate in one, the pool bar for lunch one day, which was great. The pool itself is excellent, quite large and with very good pool service and complimentary iced water. The rooms were spotless and had everything expected in a five star hotel. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were also quite large. The main standout point of this hotel was the service. It was wonderful throughout our entire stay.

Pool and the area is excellent for a quiet swim and rest. Handy bar near the pool. Had breakfast in restaurant, ample food, great range even if a touch over priced. Would highly recommend this hotel.

I choose Pan Pacific because of the rating here AND a good price. I had booked on their website and then found a rate on booking.com that was 75 Singapore dollars a night cheaper. Now unlike say, Marriott, Pan Pacific says they will beat all advertised rates by 10%, INCLUDING pre-paid voucher rates, which is what booking.com was. Well, after sending in the required form, I received an e-mail the next day apologizing for the higher rate and a reservation with my new rate. For 5 nights, the savings was nice. Good job Pan Pacific! The hotel is beautiful and is in a nice area connected to many malls and short indoor walk to the MRT. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely and cold water and a towel are brought to you instantly. I like that the pool is separated into a shallow and a deep end. Not just one depth for the whole pool like too many others. The concierge's were very helpful and friendly in finding me a bookstore and doctor's office and giving me directions. There were some service problems though. 1. Upon checking in, I asked if I could have a corner room and was willing to wait as it was still 9am. 2 hours later I was given a room. I was happy for the early check-in. I was not happy that it was not a corner room. In fact, the way this hotel is designed, there is NO corner room! It's all angles. It seemed the front desk did not understand what a corner room meant. 2. They asked what newspaper I wanted and I said International Herald. The next morning there was no paper and I complained. That day they still screwed up by giving me a Singapore paper. Same thing happened the second day, no paper. 3. I needed to make a quick phone call and the only pay phone in the lobby was out of service. Had to go up to my room. It was still out of service the next day even though I told them about it the day before. 4. The remote was missing from the room and it took lots of explaining to the man who showed up that I had looked everywhere already. After he spent 10 minutes looking himself he said, \"Remotes missing\". I told him I knew that already! Now in fairness, I did speak to the duty manager and he was very apologetic and asked what he could do for me. I told him just makes sure these problems don't happen to other people and make sure the paper starts being delivered. He insisted that he must do something for me, so he arranged for a hotel car to take me to the airport since I was planning on taking an airport bus. There was also a plate of fruit and chocolates waiting for me in my room that night.

We decided to spend most of our time in Bali (which was a really nice place), then Kuala Lumpur and short stay in Dubai on the way back. However, since it's a long trip from Russia to Bali, and Singapore gives 96-hour transit visa on arrival (if you have flight leaving to 3rd country) we decided to make a 3-night stopover in Singapore. Before I continue, I'd like to say a couple of words about my philosophy when it comes to staying in hotels: - when I am on vacation in nice places on a sea shore (like Bali, Langkawi etc.), I choose hotels which are right on a coast and preferably with sea view. I am ready to pay extra as it's just really nice to sit at the balcony in a comfortable chair with a cocktail or a glass of chilled white wine, breeze fresh cool sea air in, free your mind and just relax listening to the ocean sound. - when we are talking about spending nights in cities (European trips), I book nice 2-3-star hotels. It depends on a country, of course, as in some places even 4-star hotel could be worse than what I'd call \"average European style\" 3-star hotel. The thing is as I plan to spend most of a day going around town, watch old buildings, visit museums or just hiking etc., basically I need hotel just to leave my baggage, go to bed at the end of a day, sleep for a night and leave my room for another day of walking tour. I've spent nights in several fancy hotels in my life and mostly got really disappointed as I could not care less about \"gold-plated\" style. I dont' need a Victorian chair, and I am not ready to triple price for it. However, I do care for location (and I am ready to pay extra for it, if it saves my time and money for transport), but in Europe it's not usually an issue to find a neat place in a nice location for a nice price. Given this, you can see how booking a 5-star hotel (not a cheap one) in a big city does not fit such a phylosophy at all. However, thanks to Tripadvisor and people who leave their reviews here, I trust this site and never had problems with high-rated places. So, since I had never been to Singapore before and we were talking about 3 nights only and I wanted a place to stay which was close to Marina bay, I decided to rely on reviews and focus not on money, but on some kind of guarantee that the service would be good and I would not be dissappointed. Also, I did a little search on hotel prices and was really surprised that \"#1\" hotel was not \"#1 expensive\" at all. The location of the hotel is excellent as it's within 10-minute walk to main Marina bay tourist spots and your can promenade even late at night. It is also connected to Marina trade center through covered passages, where (in Marina trade center) you can spend some time shopping or just have a meal in a little restaurants or food court. You'd really value this as you don't have to go outside if it's raining (like it was on the second day of our trip in the afternoon). Remember, we talk about tropics, where if it rains, it's usually shower and weather forecast in Singapore is so unpredictable. What we really enjoyed is the view from panoramic window. Don't get me wrong, it's not my first high-floor hotel, but I could not imagine before, that I would like to stay in a room on a high floor with a window as big as the whole wall and spend the end of a day watching city below. It's also not my first trip to Asia (and I hope, not the last one), but it's just some magic about Singapore. It's a place where you want come back again and again, even if you are \"city-sick\". So, me and my wife usually spent the end of the day with a bottle of chilly white wine (it's a pricey thing in Singapore though, so buy a bottle or two in airport duty-free upon arrival when you come) and a small bag of little snack like pistachios, talking about our impressions and watching life going by. There was no \"...fresh cool sea air\" as the window was obviously closed and there was no sea nearby, but it was really realxing view and atmosphere. I can probably compare it with \"Trader's club towers view\" in Kuala Lumpur that impressed me too. How come I have not said a word about excellent service so far? You know, it's just so natural in this hotel, that I can not come up with a long story. The rooms were clean, a newspaper was delivered every day, the breakfast was good, the people were polite, the service was great and yet \"invisible\"...but those words can not convey what I'd call \"aura\" of this place. After spending just three nights there I realized that there actually could be a hotel in a big city that could make me feel really comfortable and not like in a big stone sack at the end of a day. Me and my wife plan to visit Asia again via Singapore and this time it's not even a question which place we are going to stay.

We booked online and managed to get room and breakfast for a reasonable price. If you can get breakfast included then it is well worth it. The hotel has rooms on 3 sides, overlooking the Marina, or the swimming pool or an ugly building - needless to say make sure you are not overlooking the later! Check - in, didn't experience any problems with queues and the like. Young lady escorted us to our room, both times on 27th floor with a view of the pool - full length window. Only comment would be that we asked if we could have a view of the Marina and was told that the hotel was full but if we were willing to pay an extra $30.00 per night we could have one of those rooms (happened both times). Luggage was delivered to our room promptly and the porter was very helpful and explained all the room features. Room was fantastic, large kingsize bed, plenty of room, tv, internet access, great bathroom - with a deep bath. The hotel provided a birthday cake to the room as we were celebrating my 50th - which was a nice touch. We used the gym - absolutely amazing - modern equipment and heaps of it, apparently open 24 hours and provided free water and a towel. Swimming pool - lovely, again free water and a towel, friendly staff - not enough sun shades though. Can order drinks and food around the pool and no smoking permitted which was a bonus. Cost of food and drinks - expensive - but we tried a few other hotels in Singapore (and even Dirty Nellies pub) and they were all around the same price! Superstar Virgo charged us $21.00 for a jug of tiger beer - anytime, the Pan Pacific charged $30.00 - but only between the hours of 5pm and 7pm!!!! both prices are quoted without the additional service charge which was extra. If the hotel lowered their prices they would probably sell a lot more food and beverage, and please put the full price of the product there is nothing worse that finding out that service and GST is on top. Had 2 beers at the Raffles Hotel $18.00 each plus tax!! Singapore sling was $25 plus tax - nothing liking fleecing the tourists, it's a once only experience thats for sure. Breakfast - brilliant - one of the best if not the best buffet breakfast we have ever experienced. Amazing choice of food, western and eastern - definately something for everyone. the cost is quite steep but if it is included in the cost of the room it's worth it. I have never seen such an array of food, smoked salmon, cheeses, cereals, pastries, eggs, curry, noodle soup - you name it and they will have it. If you didn't find something to like at this breakfast - well you would have to be very fussy eater. open from 6 am to 11 am, which was great on our last day as we still had time for an early breakfast before our 9am flight out. We were allowed to use the executive business centre to print out our boarding passes for free, if you want to use the hotels computer it is an extra $5.00 per hour - I think, we didn't want to lug our laptop on holiday, but there was internet access in all the rooms. The staff were always friendly and smiling - and always said hello where ever and whenever you saw them. The hotel is walking distance to the Marina and to Orchard Road and of course Sun Tec shopping Mall is just there. We had an indian meal at Sun Tec which was very enjoyable and a third of the price of our indian meal at the Banana Leaf (little India)! Both meals were great hot and spicy!

We \u2013 my parents and I \u2013 actually stayed here two years ago; in July 2008. For some reason, I have postponed the writing of this review several times. Perhaps because it was such a good experience, that I found it difficult to put it into words. We stayed here for 9 nights in total, with a 4-day trip to Malaysia after the 7th night. Once we got back to Pan Pacific for our last two days in Singapore, we were greeted with a \u201cWelcome home!\u201d - something I would say sums up a fabulous stay at Pan Pacific Singapore. While the rooms are nicely furnished and generous in size, it\u2019s the staff that really gives the experience a final touch, making it qualify for what best would be described as perfect. At the time of our stay, the hotel was extremely well staffed. There was always someone around the corner to greet us, ask how our day had been and if there was something they could assist with. The fascinating part is that the personalized and very comfortable interaction between the staff and us as guests applied for (almost) every single member of the staff. Always smiling and what seemed to be genuinely helpful. The only exception was in the restaurant at the top, which I will come back to later. For the room, we stayed in a deluxe room first on the 19th floor and, after our return from Malaysia, on the 17th floor. Both of our rooms were, as I mentioned before, big and very nicely decorated. It all looked very fresh and modern. In addition, the view from the balcony was fantastic; facing the harbor and business district of Singapore. Speaking of the balcony, the only negative thing about our room was that the balcony itself was very dull \u2013 it was basically a cemented box without any place to sit and with no decorations or plants. Perhaps it has changed now? We tried the room service once and there was nothing to complain about it. Reasonably quick, presented in a good way and the food tasted good. For dinner, we tried both Hai Tien Lo at the top and Zambuca on the third floor. Hai Tien Lo was a bit of a disappointment, the food was good (but nothing special), however the service and atmosphere was not what I had expected. The staff members were quite stiff and seemed utterly bored \u2013 perhaps this was supposed to be a part of some kind of exclusive approach, but to me it didn\u2019t work out as I assume it was intended \u2013 it was just awkward. For Zambuca, it was a better experience. The food was far above average and the staff more relaxed, still being attentive and helpful. My mother had a risotto, which she still considers to be the best she ever had. To sum it all up, we had a fantastic stay and would not doubt to stay here again if (when) we come back to Singapore.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cthe best hotel i've ever checked in\u201d", "Author": "EvemarkL", "ReviewID": "UR81667730", "Content": "would love to come back to singapore and stay here... this is my favorite hotel so far.. excellent service!", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Stay\u201d", "Author": "shazzabling", "ReviewID": "UR81306566", "Content": "We spent two amazing nights at the Pan Pacific - we upgraded to a club room on the 34th floor and it was well worth it.

The bedroom was decorated in shades on light yellow to gold. It had a queen sized bed, with two night tables next to it. The closet was a medium sized one, with a safe in it. There was a wood dresser with three drawers below it, and a TV on top. By the window, (that overlooked the canal), there was a table and two chairs. There was a mini bar, and a desk, that had a lamp, telephone and a computer port on it. The Bathroom: The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom. There was a walk in shower stall, that had a seat. You could use it as a steam bath. The bath tub could hold two people....where was my husband when I needed him? On the tap was another shower head, so you could wash your back. There were two sinks in a long counter. On the counter was a vase of fresh flowers and a basket of full of shampoo, conditioner, after bath lotion, and talcum powder. The mirror was as long as the counter. There was a non-mist small pull out mirror that was on the end near the door. Next to it was a hair drier. Next to the toilet was a telephone. The towels were thick terry cloth, and the ones you used after taking a bath or a shower would cover a twin bed. When I put one over my head, it when to the floor. Restaurants: The Atrium Lounge, is where I had breakfast every morning. It becomes a bar at noon. The best time to go to the bar is between 5pm-6pm, when they serve 2 for 1 drinks, and free canapes. I at once at both the Hai Tien Lo Cantonese Restaurant and the Keyaki Japanese Restaurant. There is a Disco that stays open late at night, not many places do, so most of the Canadians, met there for a night cap. I Used: The out door swimming pool, newsstand and concierge service. I Didn\u2019t Use: The Spa, Gym or Tennis Courts. The Owners: All Pan Pacific Hotels are owned by the Tokyu Company, based in Japan. I have stayed at their hotels in Mexico City, San Francisco and Vancouver. Location: The Suntec Mall is attached to the hotel, and I didn\u2019t have far to walk to buy my husband a chop, (seal), for our anniversary. You walk across a ramp to get to the other side of the street. This is where the Millennium Walk Mall, where they sell tourist items, and I bought my children and grandchildren T-shirts there.

We had to book 2 rooms so we could have a kingside and two twins but they were connected. From the moment we arrived everything was efficiency and service. We booked through ebooker and got breakfast included ($117 for 2 adults and 2 children) - so a great deal. The hotel is beautiful with the most amazing atrium which had futuristic lifts going up and down - the kids couldnt believe it. Rooms were very spacious with a desk for your laptop and loads of cupboard space. Huge comfortable bed and amasing views (19th floor) Large bathroom with bath , seperate show and toilet. Great house keeping with evening turn down service too. The hotel connect directly with Suntec and Marina shopping - its in the centre of everything so we could pick up the Duck tours around the corner, go the Raffles- one block down and easliy get taxis everywhere (so cheap). The hotel pool is wonderful - on the 4th floor - compliemtary towels and bottles of ice cold water - just what you need in 34C. The staff were so accomodating and allowed us to extend our room until 6pm (instead of Noon) so we could relax before catching out 11pm flight to London - now thats service!

I stayed on the executive level Pacific Club of the Pan Pacific Hotel. The checkin was fast, efficient and in no time I was given a keycard for my room on the 33rd floor. The lifts (due to customer requests) move slowly and offer magnificent views either of the cbd and Marina Bay skyline or the internal 35 floor atrium. The rooms are spacious and have a full sized bath and shower. The toiletries are Occitane and there are always sufficient, towels, hand towels, face washes, bath robes and slippers. I really appreciated the large dedicated desk which included a complete stationery set (scissors, paperclips, stapler, tape ruler etc). There is a choice of 4 pillow types and the bed is a genuine King Size bed. Pacific Club level rooms have free breakfast, free wireless internet, free non-alcoholic drinks from the mini bar, and 2 items laundered/dry cleaned daily free of charge. The staff are overtly polite and attentive. Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff gave above and beyond in terms of my care and comfort while staying at the hotel. My last stay in a 5 star hotel was the London Sofitel, which was immensely disappointing experience, where the Sofitel missed the big and little things that define the 5 star experience. The Pan Pacific Singapore is for me the new gold standard for 5 star hotels. The Pan Pac got the little things right and the big things perfect. For business or pleasure you must not look past this hotel in Singapore. I exercised daily in the hotel gym and swam in the famous pool most mornings. Staff provide you with towels (hand towel for gym and beach towel for pool) and water bottles (chilled or 'room temp'). At the end of your gym workout or swim they offer you fresh fruit. The Pan Pacific is located close to the MRT Esplanade stop and with plenty of dining options available in the three nearby Malls (Marinna Square, Suntec City Mall, and Millenia Walk). I walked daily through the interconnected Malls to the MRT City Hall stop to catch my train to downtown Singapore.

In Customer Service Relations Management they are so far on top of my list. We arrived Singapore at minutes passed 7 am, came out of the airport around 9 am and the limousine service driver was waiting there for us. We had a little traffic enforcement encounter that stalled us a bit, but the driver was so apologetic. When we arrived at the hotel, though check in time is at 3 pm, we were greeted and treated as VIPs by their Guest Relations Officer, without wasting a minute of our time or at least hardly more than few minutes, she already escorted us to our rooms that were ready for our occupancy at such an early day without any additional charges and all requests made were followed to the dot. It was truly an amazingly refreshing feeling the way Pan Pacific Management ensured that we be treated importantly and with hardly any glitch, aside from an elevator incident that was settled really quickly and without more hassle than necessary. Rooms were clean and comfy and very much as what anyone would expect of a 5-star hotels. The location was impeccable especially for a city life, right smack in the middle of really good sites, malls and whatnot in the city at least. Then, Check Out was also quick and hassle-free. Customer Service Satisfaction Surveys were sent via email that was so easy to answer, and they even send you back a copy of how you have rated them and feedback/s immediately given concerning any matter that you have indicated on the survey. Truly, hats off to Pan Pacific Customer Service Management Practices, not just principles, but they truly practice and effectively at that allowing guests to not only feel welcome and comfortable but also as VIPs.

The impressive reception / lounge / bar area and the sheer height of the ceiling as we looked up made an immediate impact. Check-in was seamless and quick, as indeed was check-out at the other end. The external glass lift gave a good imitation of the Singapore Flyer albeit from a restricted angle as it fired us skywards to the 31st floor room that we were given. The room made a similar impact with touches like remote-controlled blinds and a full length window from which to enjoy the view over the Marina and Singapore Flyer. from our high vantage point we were able to enjoy the fireworks and a little of the atmosphere of the opening ceremony of the inaugural Youth Olympics. Earlier, we had enjoyed witnessing two of the final torch carriers runnig through Raffles Boulevard. So an excellent stay with very little to complain about? For the most part the answer is in the affirmative but just as some hotels possess that \"je ne sais quoi\" which one cannot clearly define, this one lacked it. Maybe it was the size of the place, maybe it was the price we paid compared to other five star hotels, or maybe it was something else. We certainly felt that the lack of inclusive internet in the room price was poor. On our Asian trip we had so enjoyed the easy accessibility to family at home to share our experiences, photos etc. - until we arrived here. We stumped up the asking price for limited access and received a good connection but feel that this should not have been an extra. The lack of an inclusive breakfat (alternative to pay an extra $60 or so for the two of us did not seem good value either) disappointed us and also probably removed us from witnessing the heart and soul of the place. We felt the place lacked soul; low visibility of staff with whom we would normally exchange a quick greeting and smile, likewise other guests seemed lost in the black hole, and a feeling of emptiness and a cold, clinical efficiency echoed around the large building. There was just something missing........... Would we recommend to a friend? Yes, most certainly but not without the caveats outlined above and most certainly only if the price offered irresistible value for money (or somebody else was paying!) I suppose in fairness the tripadvisor reviews led us to have very high expectations and in truth they were not quite met.

The concierge seemed to have limited knowledge regarding kids activities - no warning that Universal Studios needs pre-booking at least 24 hours ahead (thus we made the trip to Santosa with 3 kids in tow two days running..), had not heard of the children's garden at the Botanic Gardens, was about to send us in a taxi to the other end of the island to Wet Wet Wild water playground at 9.30 in the morning when it did not open until 1pm etc etc. On checkout we happened to get Mark again who handed us a bill for the full cost of 6 nights accommodation plus breakfasts despite our 45 min check in and lengthy discussions.. it took 30mins to sort out the bill (ie for him to realise for a second time that yes we had already paid for everything). After this we asked for a customer feedback form, and were told that this could only be done on-line. They took our email address to send us a form and we have never heard anything from them. Putting these annoyances aside the staff were always polite, the rooms were very comfortable although a little dated, the breakfast was fantastic, the kids loved the pool, the gym was great, there were always taxis waiting, and there was easy access to shopping malls nearby. It was too far to walk with the kids to the MRT stations (we did it once) which was a downside of an otherwise good location. This hotel is OK but I would not put it top of the list if travelling with young children.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious\u201d", "Author": "jenngregg", "ReviewID": "UR74339749", "Content": "Luxurious accommodations.

My only disappointment was with the balcony where you could not sit and look out at the lovely Marina Bay views because it was solid concrete up to waist level. Having said that, it's so hot and humid that being outside is not that desirable! LOCATION - the hotel is adjacent to a large shopping mall and it's easy to walk to Marina Bay through the mall. In fact we got the boat back from Clarke Quay to the Bay and walked back to the hotel which probably took 10-15 minutes. Raffles, Chijmes and the Singapore Flyer are also easy walks if you can stand the heat. PRICES - this is my only quibble. I thought the breakfast and drinks were extortionate! Admittedly Sterling is very weak at the moment but \u00a312 for a beer (not even a pint) and about \u00a323 for a buffet breakfast is a rip-off in my books. I did raise this with the hotel through a post-stay survey and I had a nice personal email back thanking me for my comments and telling me how they try to keep their prices in line with other hotels.

We shouted ourselves this leg of the trip being our way home to Melbourne after 21 nights in Europe. We lashed out and we stayed 4 nights which set us back 600 Singapore dollars each night. We chose the Pacific club package which was heaven on earth. We are even thinking of coming back just to spend a long weekend here. The Hotel, we arrived early around 8am. A taxi from the airport was approx 13 Singapore dollars. We arrived at the hotel and was escorted to the 33rd floor which has its Pacific Club check in there. They had orange juice and a wet towel waiting for us. After the filling out of the paperwork, they showed us to our room, rm3319, which was a Habourside room with outside balcony. They also allowed us to have breakfast even though we really shouldn't have gotten into the room till after 2pm. The room was smaller than I thought after our stay at a similar set up in KL but still bigger than anything we had throughout Europe. The bathroom had normal size shower but on its own not over the bath. The toilet was separate as too the bath. There was one wash basin but plenty of bench space and a big mirror. The room had a king size bed, a desk, a lounge chair with foot rest and a LCD wall mounted TV with DVD player. We had 3 phones and the usual safe, tea and coffee, mini bar and good storage rooms for clothes. Also an iron and ironing board. The bed was comfy. One thing that I feel the room needs is a luminated clock so when you wake up you can see what time it is. The drapes were remote controlled and really shut out the light. We had to get wake up calls a couple of times after we slept in due to the darkness. What would be good is that you could programme the drapes to lift say at 8am or when ever. The mini bar has alcohol as well as soft drinks and juice. The soft drinks and juices are free which is handy to take when you go out. There is also bottles of water which are free. If you want more, just ring the butler. We also had a bowl of fruit which was replenished every day and little containers fill of nuts and lollies which also got filled up every day. You don't want to miss breakfast...... Speaking of which, breakfast was the usual spread with hot and cold food on selection on the 33rd floor. There is also another much bigger one on the 4th floor so I was told but we choose to eat with a view of the Harbour. The room offers a 24 hour butler, 2 items of clothing to be laundered for free, pay extra for additional items, 24hr use of the pantry which usually has someone there to make you tea and coffee and a freezer which has ice creams including mini magnums. Breakfast was between 7-10. There is always something to eat in the pantry. Afternoon tea was between 3pm-5pm and had cakes as well as yummy club sandwiches and happy hour was on the 34th floor between 5:30 pm and 8pm. They served hot finger food which was different everyday and the usual alcohol including cocktails, champagne and selected spirits and beer. Then between 8pm-9pm was liquors and we just had Baileys maybe 3 glasses and even they went over the 9pm mark. The view was spectacular and just watching the Harbour especially now with the new Marine Sands hotel complex open, was a treat. Everyone was so friendly and always greeted you with a smile. David is a great manager of the staff and Daryl, Judd and Grace were very nice and helpful. If you do lash out and decide to pamper yourself, do this even for the experience, you wont regret it. The pool was great and gave you bottles of water. There are plenty of sun lounges to choose from. We ate at the Chinese restaurant on the 37th floor and this was very nice but expensive so we only did it the once. There are plenty of restaurants around and we heard that the Swiss building has one on the 70th floor so next time we will go there. I have never seen so many orchids in a building as I did in the Pan Pacific. There is a central atrium which the Hotel is built in a shape of a triangle and you can see right up the middle and Orchids grace every floor along the open corridors and in every room. The internet is free off the breakfast room on the 33rd floor. Our flight was flying out of Singapore at 9pm but they allowed us to stay and we had a private transfer at 6pm. They also insisted we have one last drink at happy hour and we left our room at 5pm, they took our bags and we went for that one last drink (or was it 2 drinks!!) We caught the Taxi everywhere. $6 to the casino or 10min walk, $6 to Futun digital Mall which is the place to go for camera and pc gear. Speaking on the casino, you will need your passport to gain entry. Locals have to pay $100 to get in but tourist are allowed in for free. The Singapore flyer you can see from the Hotel and cost $3.80 by taxi or 10 min walk. We queued for an hour at the London eye but this Ferris wheel I walked straight in and there were a number of capsules vacant early in the afternoon. Cost was $29 but you can get a tourist book that has a coupon in the back that saves 15% which helps the cost. We did the night safari tour but was disappointed in that the tour was running late and we felt rushed. We missed out on a show due to rain and the tram ride was good but you could have walked around as well and seen more if you had the time. I went to the Botanical gardens just for the Orchids and was not disappointed. They are great and plenty to see. If you like shopping then all the ladies shops are there in mall after mall in Orchard Rd. There are 2 Malls off the Pan pacific so you haven't got far to go. Entrance is off the 2nd floor. There is always Taxis out the front of the Hotel and they are cheap. Orchard Road is the shopping Mecca ....for ladies. Not much for blokes and I left lovey to do her own thing. We caught taxi to Clarke Quey were we picked up the River cruise boat and toured the river and Harbour. There is another crowd called Hippos hop on hop off bus and boat so they do that at various places along the river where as this boat didn't stop, it just slowly went along the river which was fine for us. Singapore is a very clean and great vibrant city with so much construction works going on, I think if you left it 2 years to go back, you would be amazed how much it has changed. We caught a taxi to Santosa island for about $15. The island was a bit disappointing for the cable car wasn't working, the tower lift was broken and the beaches were dirty. We went to underwater world which was OK but nothing special. Couldn't go to movie world for it was booked out. Caught the monorail back just as it poured with rain. The Pan Pacific will definitely get us back and I can see why it is number 1 on Trip advisor. If you would like to ask me anymore questions, please feel free to email me on ian.morris@nn.com.au.

We were charged for 8 days even though we only stayed 6 full nights. No room upgrades, free food, fruit basket, anniversary gift, nothing. We arrived at 3:00am Saturday June 19 and tried to check in with the two ladies at the arrival desk. They seemed to resent us interrupting their paper shuffling and ignored us as long as possible. They begrudgingly assigned us a room, would only give us one room card even though there were three adults in the party, and only seemed interested in getting our credit card. I asked if I could get a refrigerator to store my insulin. I was told to put it in the minibar but not to move anything or we would be charged for it. Even though we had the Do Not Disturb sign out, housekeeping rang our doorbell twice before 9:00am. They didn\u2019t like being told to come back later, demanding to know what time we would be out of the room. During our stay housekeeping never seemed to comprehend that there were three people in the room \u2013 we never got more than two glasses or mugs. Sometimes there would be three sets of towels in the afternoon and a set would be removed by evening. The room was kept vacuumed but the bathroom floor was never washed. The concierge desk was basically useless \u2013 little interest in helping, inaccurate directions, and poor English comprehension. Tried the Global Kitchen for breakfast once, my wife and daughter looked at the buffet and walked out. I stayed and paid $41.20 for a plate of ice-cold food. There was an omelet station and some kind of meat under a heat lamp but no one there to serve. I couldn\u2019t tell what I was supposed to be eating because the food labels were so small. The only excellent service that we received was from the evening pool attendant. He even extended the awning over our chairs one night when it started raining. Left at 1:00am the next Saturday night, same two ladies were at the arrival desk. We went to the departure desk and were ignored, finally someone told us to walk over to the arrival desk. They once again resented having their paper shuffling interrupted, wanted our credit card again, and asked if the $41.20 was all we charged.

I had the opportunity to stay on of the \"Club Pacific\" floors. My suite was wonderful (living area plus a bedroom), with automated blinds and a wonderful view. It included nice amenities such as complimentary fruits and snacks, soft drinks, and bottled water. In addition, Pacific Club members are entitled to a complimentary breakfast each morning that was delicious, as well as perks like free wifi and 2 free articles of laundry cleaned per day. In fact, it is a bit of a shame that they do not do a better job informing their guests of the benefits they are entitled to. They rattle them off when you first get there, and that is about it. This reflects a general problem with the hotel: while the people there are nice, and try their best, they are not always aware enough of their own hotel to be of help. For example, I was told that I could have full use of the business center to get some work done after I checked out, but before my late flight. When I showed up at the \"business center\" (really just a cocktail lounge) they at first told me I probably should not use my laptop there due to it being a public area and that I should go \"somewhere else\". Finding this sort of strange for a business center, I assured them I would take the risk. Even then, they insisted on charging me for the wifi. It took forever to coordinate them with the Pacific Club to gain access, and even then the wifi was only covered for an hour. I would have made more of a stink, but it was easier to just go to the airport and use *their* wifi.

Furthermore, he sent a large beautiful bouquet of flowers with Get Well wishes from all the staff. Oh My God! Are these people for real?! Another duty manager then preceded to send up free food, whatever my wife wanted, volunteered in offering a late checkout as our plane was not leaving for Sydney until 8.30pm that night....nothing was a problem. Our daughter's bassinet was in the room when we arrived along with a bag full of baby products and a toy. Other than that, we tried dinner and breakfast at the hotels' various restaurants and can recommend them.

Now if i am paying 220usd per night, i expect the hotel to have their basics right. The breakfast however was excellent though the same confusion followed there as well. well all inall a nice hotel with excellent views, but would still Prefer Marina Mandrin over them just because of their service, also the standard room was equally good to pan pac,s panoromic rooms, thus i would imagine that pan pac,s standard room would be a little less in mandrin;s comparison.

Up to my perfect room (via speedy prettily lit lifts affording views of a spectacular atrium) -spacious, just the right temperature, floor to ceiling windows to make the most of the view, huge comfy bed and all the little extras like a gown and slippers and an adaptor already in place for my Australian connections. Internet access was rapid and reasonbly priced (although couldn't say same for mini-bars, why are they always sooo overpriced?!) and best of all the room was quiet - no mean feat in a busy hotel in the middle of a hectic city.

Our stay here was to be a relaxing treat after travelling through Hong Kong and Australia for a few weeks but it turned out to be anything but! As we have 3 children under 12 we had requested connecting rooms at the time of booking- 4 months before our stay and had also phoned with regard to this and had e mailed to re confirm our request prior to leaving on our trip. We arrived at the hotel at about 8 pm and were given our two rooms-2 floors apart!! When I explained that this would not be possible because our children were so young I was told by staff that each adult would need to separate to be with the children, However when I insisted that this would not work as all our luggage was together we were then offered two rooms on the same floor but not near to each other. I felt this was not acceptable as I had taken measures to ensure we had two connecting rooms and was told that it was because the hotel was operating on 10% over capacity! Eventually we were reluctantly given a suite with two fold down beds for 3 children but were told that they would not allow us to have this room for the second night ( I presume because of the cost to them) and that we would need to re pack and move rooms again the next day. We didnt get into our room that night until 9 45PM and the reception staff suggested that we should eat in the Restaurant on the top floor as it has 360 degree views around the city- the kids were excited and our spirits lifted, we didnt even change and went straight up as were so hungry. We arrived to be told that the Restaurant was closing!! We were offered free breakfast for two days to compensate for the rooms but were unable to take this on the first morning as we had booked a breakfast trip to the zoo. We were told that our connecting rooms would be ready for us on return from the zoo and that our luggage would be moved for us. This did not happen, We returned after 4 pm and our rooms were not ready, our luggage was still in the first room ( that they would not allow us to stay in for the second night) and we were kept waiting at reception again.......Of course we needed to get washed, changed and dressed for going out for dinner so were keen to get into our rooms. We were allowed into one of the rooms eventually and then had to wait until 19 20 to get into the second room!! We had to phone twice to ask for the connecting door to be opened and when nothing happened I then had to go to reception-again! By this time the children were totally shattered and we were thoroughly fed up with the place. On the second night the Icelandic Volcano started to cause problems which meant we were stranded in Singapore, we stayed one more extra night in the pan Pacific as we had no choice but as soon as we could we booked into different accom- and got much better service for half the price! Yes it is a stunningly beautiful hotel but for us, sadly, that is all.

We booked the Pan Pacific over the Mandarin Oriental based on the reviews here, but although it's definitely not the worst hotel we've stayed in (check out our review of the Inter Plaza in Egypt for that), it's unfortunately really disappointing for a #1 hotel. Style wise it's bland and very...odd. Service wise it's so so. Panoramic room was comfy although panoramic is stretching the term. Breakfast was awful - truly awful. Dull and impersonal sums it up really. In a bit more detail... We checked in early (about 6am) and unfortunately there were no rooms ready. This was understandable due to a big conference and the ash cloud chaos but there didn't seem to be any attempt to make us feel welcome and it was the start of a very impersonal hotel experience. We had just come from a tiny Maldivian resort so perhaps we were being a bit spoilt but we decided to go and have breakfast at the Mandarin Oriental over the road and were greeted like old friends. It was a different world over there. The breakfast at the Mandarin was amazing and although expensive (90 SIN $ for 2) it was only slightly more than the awful Pan Pacific offering which classed 3 different types of melon (and only melon) as it's fruit offering. Room noise wasn't great. We were on the 26th floor and could always hear when the room above had a shower or flushed the loo. To be honest there's not much more to say. The pool looked nice and room service was OK but nothing stood out. All very blah blah blah. So much so we only stayed 2 days instead of 4, choosing to go back to the Maldives (Baros - very lovely).

I\u2019d looked at other hotels and locations prior to booking the Pan Pacific and could not find a hotel with a better price/value ratio and of course the TA reviews helped with the decision. It was an excellent place to stay for our family, first-time visitors to Singapore. Location: Yes, it\u2019s rather a long walk to the nearest MRT station, either over or underground, and this is perhaps why we never got to use MRT while in Singapore. It was so much easier to catch a cab. Luckily they are quite cheap by European standards. If you are watching your budget, make sure you don\u2019t get into a limo taxi (we once got into a black Chrysler cab, being unaware, and the ride turned out more expensive than it should). As said many times before, plentiful shopping and dining opportunities are within short walking distance from the Pan Pacific: Suntec, Marina Square, Millenia Walk and Esplanade shopping malls. Walking to the Singapore Flyer, Merlion, Clarke Quay is not too strenuous, particularly in the evening or when it is cloudy. Room: Panoramic Deluxe on the 26th floor accessible by the elevators that run on the outside of the hotel\u2013 just great. Unfortunately, we did not get to see the Marina Bay (wow!) from our window but the views towards Suntec, St Andrews, Swissotel the Stamford were not bad, night or day. The room was spacious, spotless and bright, with a floor to ceiling window and modern design. There were iron and ironing board, bathrobes and slippers, complimentary bottled water, tea/coffee making facilities, plenty of hangers and drawer space in the wardrobe. Loved the bathroom \u2013 quite roomy, with a lovely shower, excellent water pressure, nice fluffy towels and good smelling toiletries. Basically, the room had everything a tired traveller would need after a busy day. There was a rollaway bed for our son in the room and there was still enough space for the three of us. In the hallway outside our room, across from the elevators there was a TV corner with comfy chairs, an espresso machine and tea making facilities (had more tea variety than the room) and biscuits \u2013 nice touch. Pool: Fabulous. I could not drag my 11-year-old away. Beautifully landscaped area, lots of loungers, with complimentary bottled water and towels. Varying depth, the deepest was I think was 4m, great for diving in. Underwater music, good showers. Open form 6am to 11pm, great for an early morning or late evening dip (temperature in the evening hovering around 28-29 degrees). Other: We did not had any meals in the hotel. We had our breakfasts either at the Millenia Walk (The Coffee Club \u2013 excellent set breakfasts with good coffee, TCC, Bakerzin, Coffee Bean, some local breakfast place) or Suntec (lots of options, mostly opening after 10am). Did not use the lobby bar either but it did look inviting, especially on a Saturday night when there was live music.

At first they could not find our reservation, amongst worried looks between me and my wife they told us it was because we had been upgraded to the Pacific Club to help us celebrate our wedding anniversary. What a wonderful thing for them to do! Hotel itself is magnificent, clean, well appointed, modern with helpful staff everywhere. The staff are great, especially the staff in the Pacific Club, we can not speak highly enough of them. David greeted us early in the morning with roses in our room and obviously was delighted to be able to spoil us like this. Nothing was too much hassle for the staff. On another occasion we were asked what our plans were for dinner and upon finding out that we were looking at a restaurant in the Esplanade complex we were told that we would probably need a reservation as it was a Friday night and usually fairly busy. Two minutes later they said they had taken the opportunity to make a reservation in our name. All the staff were knowledgeable and made us feel special at every opportunity. The room we stayed in was a balcony room in the Pacific Club. A very pricey room that I initially wouldn't have paid for (and didn't because it was an upgrade) but if I go back I will be paying the extra for the Pacific Club rooms. Breakfasts were a very good mix of cereals, eggs (prepared on the spot by a very friendly and professional chef), bacon and other \"fried\" breakfast items, fruit, yoghurt, meats, simple dim sum, juice, toast (wide choice of bread). The views and atmosphere in the Sunrise breakfast room are amazing. The room we were in was large and well appointed although the minibar fridge is a little small. We like to be able to purchase a few bit's and pieces and chill them for ourselves. However the amenities in the Pacific Club made this unnecessary. Bathrooms are well laid out and luxurious. Pre-dinner drinks and canapes are served in the Sunset room and once again the staff's skill, professionalism and friendly manner shone through. We had not planned to attend pre-dinner drinks at the hotel but the wonderful staff made us reconsider this and we had drinks there every night of our holiday. The swimming pool was a great place to unwind and relax. Chilled water and fresh towels laid out and waiting when guests arrive.

Pricing is not dirt cheap, but for the level of service and comfort, it's an amazing deal. I find the service superlative because it is discreet (not \"in your face\" as is the case in many hotels). Great service is available, always, but if do no not need it, you don't get constantly pestered. There is a great selection of restaurants in the hotel (the Japanese restaurant is one of my 2 favorites in Singapore) and the hotel is linked to 2 shopping arcades. There is a great selection for room service and it arrives promptly (always much faster than promised) and piping hot. Laundry service is also very fast (the normal, slow, option is usually back in the room before 5pm) and has been able to get the most horrid stains from a few shirts that I thought were irremediably lost. TV is a large flat-screen, with a plethora of cables (VGA, HDMI, iPod, \u2026) that lets you connect any device you might have to take advantage of the screen.

The Pan Pac as it is commonly known by provided 2 free complimentary parking tickets per day for my friends. Well done to this Hotel. The room facilities was clean and tidy but what made it more impressive was the harbour views. I recommend that if your budget can afford it book the room with a balcony view. It's georgeous. Having a chance to relax and also catchup on business the desk provided amble room for me to email and catchup on much needed news back in NZ. Being a gym addict having access to a 24hour gym was a priority. Even after my late arrival back to my hotel in the wee hours of the morning 1:30am I was still able to go to the gym and work out. Thats definitly a feather in the Pan Pacific cap. The staff are very friendly and hospitable. They really do care for their quests who stay in their hotel. But what was most impressive was when I returned back to the hotel after 4 days. The doorman greetd me and welcomed me back but what amazed me was the young women who greeted me by name without even looking up my name on their booking system. Very, very impressive indeed. I did book into another hotel which is also a 5 star for the night but canceled that and returned back to the Pan Pac. Access to the local shopping is very close and the food malls are a stone throw away. A little walk in comfort to the MRT is near and you can rest assure there are pleanty of taxis at this hotel to take you wherever. So if you are deciding where to stay...book into this Hotel.

We checked into the PanPacific at about 2am local time, we had paid for the night before to ensure we would have a room upon arrival. Huge time difference from home, so my daughter kept waking up at 3am everyday wanting breakfast :) The Pan Pacific was fabulous, super clean, modern, and exceeded all expectations.The room was super contemporary,clean, big tv, fancy electric operated window shade, great view of the city. The rooms overlook a central atrium, a style that I like (no dark hallways). The hotel has a full buffet breakfast that we enjoyed 2 mornings, it is expensive ($aprox $50pp USD) but very good. You'll get both local foods & western style foods. My kid loved it. We also went to the rooftop Japanese restaurant. This is a spectacular place, do go look at it! The food was WAY OVERPRICED, but it was very good (not great enough for the price). We saw the swimming pool, it looked fine, but we didn't have time to go in. The hotel is connected by a hallway to a large shopping mall. The mall is something you could see in any western city, your typical chain shops. BUT there are alot of restaurants there, including a nice mcdonalds. We ate some breakfasts at the Mcdonalds, saving us some money. Regarding the Concierge: They were helpful, but gave out some bad advice, especially about taxicab prices. The taxi cab prices were always quite a bit higher than what the concierge quoted. The taxis are metered, you pay for time & distance. We spent alot of money on taxis! We booked a 1/2 day afternoon trip through the hotel to the Juorong Bird Park. We didn't realize that the park is a long drive from the city, and the tour was way too rushed.As soon as we got on the tour bus the guide was telling us \" we don't have much time at the park, we are in a hurry to return\" because he had another tour to do! We barely got to see anything at the bird park. The next day we decided to take a cab (in the morning) to the daytime zoo. Again, alot of trafic getting out of the city, taxi was very expensive (I think $50-60USD) one way. The zoo was excellent. This is not a huge zoo. My kid was able to FEED ELEPHANTS, and she was chosen to participate in the sea-lion show. You must feed the elephants, its about $5USD, the animals are in the swimming pool and reach their trunks up to grab the food. I've never encountered this in any US zoo, this was the highlight of the zoo visit. When we tried to leave the zoo in the afternoon to return the hotel, there was a long waiting line at the taxi stand, no taxis in sight! I asked another couple if they were heading in our direction & we decided to share a cab back to the Marina hotel area. This was great, & we all saved some $$ by sharing. Later the same day we went back to the zoo for the NIGHT SAFARI. This is the BEST thing to do in SING. You get onto a tram, which takes you through the NIGHT ZOO (different from the day zoo). Fabulous! I have never seen any nightime zoo in the states, this was a real treat. You can get off the tram at various places to have a look around. Walk through the BAT enclosure, you'll never forget it!! You can buy a multi park ticket for the Bird park, the day zoo, and the night safari. This is what I suggest. Forget about the tours from the hotel, just take the cab & buy the multi ticket. This is your best value. We also went to the China town night market, nice to see & maybe take a rickshaw ride, but shopping is mostly just junk. We wanted to go to Sentosa to see the dolphins, but the dolphin exhibit was closed, so we didn't go. The sky-ride to Sentosa is also closed for repairs. Weather: try to get going early, it rains alot in SING! pack some of those small disposable rain ponchos. Safety: As a woman traveling with a child, safety is always a concern. I found SING a very safe,modern, super clean city. No jungle here. As in any metropolitan area, use common sense. YES I would definitly stay at PAN PACIFIC again & recommend this hotel to anyone.

For a fun ride I recommend travelling via the external lifts for a panoramic view of the city. We managed to go for a swim almost everyday to get baby used to the water and the pool staff were once again friendly. If there's a downside, my only minor gripe was that the MRT station was a little walk (5-10mins). However one could view this as a postive to a) walk off the generous buffet breakfast and b) look at the shops on the way as the route on the way to the MRT is underground, air-con and filled with an abundant of shops.

We checked in in under five minutes and was taken up to our room (A Panoramic King Size Double at about \u00a3120) by the very helpful staff member. We got the outside glass lift to our floor which allowed a lovely view of Singapore City Scape. On reaching our floor the first thing we were hit with was the lovely smell of a Pine Christmas tree which was situated outside of the lifts. We walked past the coffee lounge where there are free 24 hour hot drinks and directly to our room. The room itself was of a good size with a room length window overlooking the city. The furnishings were modern and the bed was very comfortable. There was a 32inch wall mounted LCD television and electric blinds allowing you privacy. There was also tea and coffee making facilities and plenty of cupboard space. The bathroom was also very roomy and had both a bath and separate power shower. Overall it was of a very high quality. Also waiting for us in the room was a beautiful chocolate cake as a gift from the management. We didn't have dinner in the hotel and decided to ask the concierge where would be good to eat. He gave us a map and told us the best places to go, from top quality restaurants over the Marina (No Signboard) to Singapore Food Markets. Again he was extremely professional and helpful. I was also aware that there was a lovely outside swimming pool (with under water music) along with a Gymnasium but only being there for one night I did not get to use these. Overall the Pan Pacific is a fantastic base for exploring Singapore. It is in a fabulous position allowing easy access to everything in the city.

We like walking, and Singapore is a very safe place, even at night, so we thought nothing of walking from here to clarke quay, boat quay, little india, and orchard road, although you need a comfy pair of shoes for this. The minibar drinks were ridiculously over-priced (its cheaper in the Hyatt!) and so were the restaurants. The foyer bar did however make some delicious cocktails. The breakfast was nowhere near as good as at the Hyatt, poor selection and stale food, although it was the same price, it wasnt worth the money.

Wow - the room itself was huge with a massive bed, chair and desk, mini bar, robes and slippers, flat scrren TV etc etc. The bathroom was luxurious, and had a huge supply of soft white towels and L'occtaine toiletries that we replaced every day, and a shower with massage jets. However the best bit was the balcony and view - to the left the Singapore flyer and in front the Marina Bay area and all the attractions, and then to the background and right various iconic buildings and tourist attractions. We stood on the balcony and sat on the furniture every day, never tiring of the view, and the NYE celebrations we saw from there were second to none.

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by staff asking us how we were and how our flight was, and were personally directed to the checking in counter. My wife and I got our times mixed up and were trying to check in at 2pm, whereas the check in time is actually 3pm, but the hotel didn't mind us arriving early - we were still able to get a balcony room on the 12th floor - all they had to do was get house keeping to join two single beds together and remake the bed. Our room had a fantastic view of the bay, the Merlion, financial district skyline and the Flyer and the room was also located in a way that no one would walk past your room unless they were specifically coming to our room, so our privacy was well looked after. And with the elevator access limited to room card holders only, our security was also well looked after. At night there was always a cabaret singer and/or pianist in the lounge on the ground floor and their voices and music would float up through the floors above and make the experience quite pleasant. And although you could hear the music once in our room, it was only audible when we were standing at the door or in the bathroom. The room itself was very spcious with lots of storage area, a decent sized desk and comfy chair, big flat screen TV with 40 odd channels and the bathroom had a separate toilet door, a shower area with double shower heads and an ottoman to boot. There were also a lot of spare towels, so there was never a need to ask house keeping for extra towels whenever the wife wanted to wash her hair. The blinds to block out the light did exactly that - blocked out the light. The blinds are remote controlled and you can choose to have the heavy blind down to block all the light, or you can lower the lace blind to let in sunlight but give yourself some privacy during the day. The bed, although joined at the middle, was very comfortable and big and the room also came with dressing robes, slippers and a safe. We didn't use any of the facilities or restaurants at the hotel because there were so many other places to eat and shop around the hotel. We had a choice of Marina Square, Suntec City and also Citylink (which also leads to the MRT) to spend time in and the cost of a taxi from the hotel to anywhere around the island was always very cheap. On our last night, we wanted to know where we could keep our luggage for a couple of hours (and do some last minute shopping), because checkout time was 12 noon and we weren't leaving for the airport until 2pm. Without being asked, Mar (who was working the desk) simply extended our checkout time till 2pm the next day, which made things a lot more simpler for us. It gave us a chance to run around all morning, then freshen up before heading out to the airport. My wife and I would love to stay at the Pan Pacific again, but because we like to stay in Singapore for weeks at a time, it becomes a costly exercise to stay in such comfort and style for the duration of our visit.

There are more luxurious rooms available, but at $150/night it was a great room at a great price. What distinguishes the hotel from others is the service. I decided to buy two of the hotel pillows since I found them so comfortable. The business center worked to find the cost of shipping them, then when it was higher than I wanted to pay, called the airport to see if I could store them there for the return trip. When I decided to take them, a doorman found a cardboard box and packed them for me. I never felt like I was imposing, and no one seemed to be angling for a tip. The breakfast buffet was wonderful, with tremendous variety of high-quality western and asian foods, and again great service. (It was a bit pricey though at about $30 USD). I had free internet, though apparently this depends on your rate plan. The hotel is connected to a good-size mall (OK, nearly everything in Singapore is connected to a mall!).

The first thing we noticed on stepping into the hotel was just how huge and busy it was. We have stayed in our fair share of big city hotels, but the Pan Pacific was really a step up from a lot of the hotels we've stayed in previously; if I was to compare it with anything, I would probably say it had a feel of a Vegas resort hotel about it (especially with the interesting design and awesome lifts!). To go along with this first impression, we therefore automatically assumed that on check in, the staff would be friendly and professional, but impersonal. However, we couldn't have been more wrong; the girl who checked us in was probably the friendliest and most outgoing person I've ever dealt with in a hotel! Knowing it was our honeymoon, she asked us all about our wedding, our holiday so far, our plans in Singapore etc, and it really felt like she was genuinely interested in everything we said. It really made me smile and was so unexpected in a big, expensive hotel like this. Throughout our stay, we found that the staff were always very friendly and helpful, and it really made us feel welcome. We were given a deluxe room with a balcony, which we were initially pleased with; however, on returning and checking our booking, I did find that the hotel were supposed to give us an upgrade to a Panoramic room as arranged by our travel agent. I'm not going to let this affect my review of the hotel as this may have been the fault of the travel agent, and we were still really happy with the room...but if anyone else has any promised upgrades, it might be worth keeping a check on them! As I said, we were very happy with our room. It was very clean, modern, a good size and we were particularly happy with the bathroom which was very elegant and neat. The only thing I would say is that there was nothing particularly original about the room. It looked great and was very comfortable but there was nothing that made it stand out. We still had a good view (looking out towards Merlion Park and with the Singapore Flyer to the left) despite only being on the 9th floor, instead of the upper floors that we maybe should have got! Amenities-wise, there were electric drapes, bottled water, robes, an electric safe and basically everything you would expect from a hotel of this quality. As our time there was so short, we didn't have a chance to try out any of the hotel restaurants or pool, but as the hotel pretty much oozes high quality, I doubt we'd have had any complaints if we had! We'd been in the room for about five minutes when there was a knock on the door from room service; on answering, I was presented with a large piece of chocolate cake and a really nice card from the hotel congratulating us on our wedding. It was a nice touch, and something that was only matched by one other hotel out of the six we stayed in throughout our trip (and the chocolate cake tasted absolutely gorgeous!). We were also very happy with the location of the hotel. The hotel is attached to a large network of shopping malls, and it's a 5-10 minute walk to the City Hall metro station (which can be reached by walking through the malls, if you want to avoid too much walking in the heat!). We preferred walking around the city as much as we could, and it probably took around twenty minutes to get to Orchard Road, ten minutes to Merlion Park and around fifteen minutes to Clarke Quay and Chinatown. There is still a lot of construction around the Marina Bay area, but there were never any problems with noise. Given the opportunity, we'd love to stay at the Pan Pacific again. It was very comfortable, incredibly clean and we were sad to leave it after only a couple of days.

The welcome was good and we booked Panoramic Rooms with a harbour view (we received long stay benefits for our 7 night stay including internet access, laundry and 25% food and beverage discount - all welcome!). The room was pleasant and immaculate if slightly dated, especially in the bathroom (which looked identical to the Marina Mandarin bathroom when I stayed there in 1995!). The balcony was a bonus but - and maybe this is a British thing - they don't seem to want you to use it! There are a couple of chairs and has fabulous views but the balcony itself is quite stark. The construction work across the bay for the new casino complex also means that there is lots of dust as indicated by the soles of your feet when you checked! The staff at the pool and the Brunch restaurant are just fantastic and deserve 5 stars on their own (thank you!). We also ate at the Hai Tien Lo on the 37 floor. The food there was sublime but service a little below par (rice arrived 10 minutes after our main courses). Breakfasts are good (if included in your rate but don\u2019t pay extra) but you may have to queue. So why 4 stars rather than 5? Well, and perhaps I am being a little churlish here, but there were two main factors for me. Number one is the Mandarin Oriental. Admittedly that hotel is more expensive but I reckon you get what you pay for as it was slightly more luxurious, slightly more stylish, and had nicer rooms and bathrooms. The second point, somewhat parochially, is that the Pan Pacific failed to acknowledge in any respect the main reason for our S$8000+ stay: my parents' Golden Wedding. They had been advised of this on booking and whilst we didn't exactly expect the red carpet treatment, maybe a bottle of wine or some flowers might have been nice?

We also had room service dinner one night and again the food was excellent. The gym facilities were great and our son was impressed that the staff were available to give advice on his weight training program. Adjacent to this was the spacious pool area . The location of the hotel is great. It is connected to several shopping centres and an easy walk to the hop on hop off bus, train station and other attractions. Taxis were always available and very cheap. The staff were brilliant. A casual request for the location of a store led to Shirley going out of her way to locate it and print off a list of alternatives. Phone calls to reception / housekeeping etc were always answered with a greeting using our name. Ensuring a taxi was there for our early morning check out - no problem. It seemed that they were genuinely happy to make us happy during our stay.

We wanted the full-on R and R treatment so we booked a room in the Pacific Club where we enjoyed many \"extras\". The best \"add-on\" to this room rate was the guaranteed early check-in and late check-out. We arrived in Singapore at 7am on Wednesday 7th October after an overnight flight from Paris, and we left Singapore on Friday 9th at 9pm. The Pan Pac was the only top end hotel that would guarantee, in writing as part of the reservation, access to our room at 8am while still only charging us for two nights. Sensational! There have been lots of reviews on the Pan Pac so I won't go on too much - but I agree that the Customer Service is amazing. Mainly I will say that by paying a bit more for the Pacific Club we essentially had three days for the price of two and this included breakfast on arrival, free internet, lots of opportunities for drinks in the lounges (best Singapore Sling ever!!), plus snacks and soft drinks at any time from the help-yourself buffet and kitchen in the Sunrise lounge. I came up after a late swim one afternoon and the wonderful desk staff on the Pacific Club floor reminded that there are ice creams in the freezer in the kitchen available any time...just a very kind and friendly \"vibe\" on this floor. I was stranded on a lower floor one day as I forgot my key card and I found a phone and they came and rescued me....so concerned that I may have felt anxious!! The pool was great - icy cold bottled water and towels on arrival and never too busy. As many have mentioned it is a bit of a walk to the MRT but for these two days we used either a taxi - or on our main \"touring\" day we used the SIA hop-on hop-off bus. The stop is right out the front of the hotel opposite Marina Square Shopping Centre. A very convenient way to get around - we love buses!! And a direct route out to the fabulous Botanic Gardens - even the MRT doesn't have a stop out there!! We love Singapore and we loved the Pan Pacific - particularly the Pacific Club.

The hotel is well located and the rooms are a decent size. Unfortunately we seemed to have had a number of misfortunes: 1. Booked the hotel limo from the airport to take our family to the hotel (2 adults + 2 young children). We were missed when we got off the plane and went to the limo after which they paged the staff member - could happen, so no problems. 2. Arrived at the hotel and was treated very well by Cai Ling - no issues with service there. We were also given the room several hours prior to official check-in. Only problem was that the room was for 4 people but we only had 3 towels and 1 bar of soap. We called for more towels and they came with more towels after some time. We also asked for some small plates and got large ones - could happen so no problems. 3. Buffet breakfast was not a pleasant experience. On day one, we arrived late at around 1030. Breakfast technically ends at 1100am. As we were in the midst of eating, the staff was busily rearranging the furniture around us for lunch. Very unpleasant from a customer service perspective. My espresso was actually served as a half cup of regular coffee but ok... On day 2, we also arrived late at around 1040. Clearly they already started cleaning up. Orange Juice was \"finished\" and by 1050, the food was basically out of bounds. I brought this up to the restaurant manager who was apologetic and basically said they were overwhelmed due to a conference next door at the conference centre. I suggested that if they wanted to get everyone out by 11am, then breakfast should technically end earlier - say 1030. 4. After breakfast we left the room at around 1 pm and returned at about 7 pm. To our horror the room had not been cleaned. In 20 years of traveling this had never happened to me. I raised this with the hotel manager directly and he was very apologetic promising to look into the issue which I'm sure he did as we received an extension to our check out and several follow-ups after I filled in the customer survey with less than the highest ratings. 5. Quality of the room cleaning was very much average. Room was not cleaned thoroughly and as for the bathroom we gave up on 4 towels... Every day the cleaning staff would only replace the 4 towels with 3. After much reflections, we realised that actual issue is that the staff was not fluent in English. In all likelihood, we had a communication problem. Unfortunately for the Pan Pacific, we had just arrived from the Mandarin Oriental in KUL which was several notches better in all respects. Service in KUL was fantastic and the staff in all areas spoke perfect English. They also called us by name at every turn whereas the Pan Pacific was hit and miss and they didn't realise that they kept addressing me by my wife's name. I'm sorry to say that my experience was not great for an Asian chain. -pf", "Date": "October 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAlways Again\u201d", "Author": "Elementex05", "ReviewID": "UR47459259", "Content": "This high story building is perfectly situated inbetween walking distance of many shopping centres and close to a tube station.

Price - reasonable room rate regardless the means of reservation, taking into account the overall quality of the hotel. What I like less about the hotel is the: Walking distance from MRT - it takes us around 15 mins to arrive the City Hall station. I have hesitation when thinking of going back in the late afternoon for a rest, before going out again in the evening. I should say the way to MRT is connected by malls that saves us from exposing to the heat though. Internet Charge - we stay in basic room and incur the expense. Free internet access is an advantage when I choose a hotel. In sum, I enjoy the stay in the hotel.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devon, England", "Title": "\u201cWell worth the stay!\u201d", "Author": "NWandJP", "ReviewID": "UR45290729", "Content": "We stopped off at the Pan Pacific on our way to Sydney on honeymoon for two nights.

We were impressed with the room, clean, spacious and a nice cityscape from our floor to ceiling windows. The only minor problem was the shower door leaking but as I say this was only minor. The pool was good, especially the staff who were ultra efficient. Although we did not have the chance to use many of the other facilities there was plenty on offer. We did however visit the Global Kitchen in the hotel and although the food was good it was very expensive (\u00a310 for two cokes) as well as the service being slow.

I booked the double preferences package on the hotel's website, and chose a one way airport limosine pickup and daily breakfast. The pickup was prompt and punctual - they actually had a very pleasant lady waiting for you with a signboard the moment you got off the plane, the limo was a new Merc with a very friendly driver, and the checkin in the hotel was so smooth that you did not even have to wait at the check-in counter: a lady was already awaiting and took us directly to our room to check in! All in all, it was very quick. The room we had was a panoramic room with a balcony on the 25th floor. I have requested that we get a view of the Marina Bay, and it was indeed very very beautiful. The room itself was big and very modern, and everything was new and clean. All in all, an excellent first impression and a very classy hotel. The breakfast was also nice, with a wide choice and variety to chose from. There's also a gym (which I did not get a chance to use - was too busy) and a pool. The pool area is nice and relaxed, though at times when everyone decides to go down and swim, it might sometimes be difficult to find a place to park your towel, if you know what I mean. :-) All in all though, we always managed to get a spot and relax. The location of the hotel is excellent. There are three shopping malls right under. Most of the stores are not branded designers (if you are looking for that kind of thing) but there are many standard brands that you can find in any country - Zara, Massimo, Women's Secret, Aldo and what not. If you are not interested in that, then there are still plenty of restaurants around and some very good foodcourts in some of the malls. All in all, there's always a place to go. The hotel is walking distance from a lot of places ... It is very close to the Esplanade, the two durian looking buildings on the marina and you can have an excellent chilli crab over there, then it is very close to the marina itself, and you can go for a walk and see the statue of the Merlion (where SO many tourists take pictures). If you want to go and have a Singapore Sling at the Raffles, it's also a 5-7 minute walk from the hotel ... It's really close. Then you can also go for a beautiful walk by the Quays ... You can take a boat ride there and go to the dozens of bars and restaurants over there at the waterfront. However, I have to warn you, because the quays is such a touristic destination, the prices there for food and drinks are quite overpriced. For example, a coconut drink there might cost 6 Singapore Dollars, and in some other place, it might be 3 or so. However, worth a visit. All in all, it's a nice place. The hotel also offers different tours. You can just go down, get a brochure, and everything will be organized for you. In short, I really liked the hotel and would gladly stay there again.

One note of caution - the minibar has one of those \"sensor thingies\" whereby if you remove an item from its location for more than 30sec, you're charged for it. Thankfully we read the notice! Breakfast was included in our tariff and it was an extensive buffet selection of western and Asian foods. If I'd had to pay separately I would not have bothered. SGD35 pp is too expensive when there are so many alternatives nearby. As others have mentioned, the staff at PPS are excellent. Nothing is too much trouble and they remember your name.

The Marina area, even with construction, is much less hectic than Orchard Rd. Shopping centres abound - the hotel is connected to 3!.

We were celebrating my husband's 50th birthday, and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. We knew some of them from previous visits and, despite there being many hundreds of guests since our last visit, they remembered us and treated us like royalty. We checked in at 11.30 pm, as we flew from New Zealand, and had lovely cold cocktails and cold flannels waiting for us. Judd, one of the Pacific Floor staff, greeted us very warmly and sailed us through the check in process. He also presented me with a bouquet of flowers! Our suite was amazing, masses of storage space and a view to die for! We had two plasma tv's, one in the bedroom and one in the living area. Free sweets on the table and a large bowl of fruit and bottles of water. As we were on the Pacific Floor we had free laundry for 2 pieces of clothing each day, which we made use of. There are masses of other advantages of being in this part of the hotel, well worth it. Breakfast was better than ever in the \"Sunrise\" room, they had expanded it since our last visit, and the choice was amazing. After a day or two the staff knew our drinks and had them waiting for us. If you want something they don't have, ie. I wanted watermelon juice, this was not a problem and appeared as if by magic! The ambiance in \"Sunrise\" was peaceful and relaxing. In the \"Sunset\" room afternoon tea was enjoyed and then cocktails between 5 and 8 pm. This really means drinks, but they are all free, so you can have as much as you want, as well as helping yourself to nibbles. The pool area is just as lovely as ever, but one tip, they have changed the sun beds and I am sure a man designed them! They are contour shaped and don't lie flat! The back of them only go down half way so you can't sunbathe on your stomach, unless you lie on the floor! Everyone thought they were a daft design and I even spoke to the Head of the hotel and complained. Hopefully they will sort them out before our next visit.

They also have a choice of pillows and additional bedding if you require it. All over the hotel the staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough to help. The doormen at the entrance of the hotel were super organised and never kept you waiting for a taxi. If for any reason there weren't any there (which only happened once) they called and ordered some.

Upon arrival, we were showed to our room by a member of the staff. As we took the lift overlooking the outside, we commented on the lovely views from the lift. The staff said that the view was even more scenic in our room because we've been upgraded to a Panoramic room. Great, I said. As we entered our room, she showed us to the balcony which true to her word, had a breathtaking view of the Harbor, Merlion, The Fullerton and The Esplanade with the Financial district's skyscrapers in the backdrop. She then completed our check in process in the room's desk area which by the way, had the very comfortable Herman Miller Aeron chairs. Another pleasing detail. The rooms were beautiful, well appointed and quite spacious and is even more pleasing in person than in the photos we saw in the reviews. Just like any good hotel, it has everything you would need. LCD TV, an electronic safe safe which could fit your laptop were just some of the amenities in the room. The bathrooms were also impressive and again any photos you may see does not reflect the true state of the bathrooms. A tub and a separate toilet and shower stall. When I saw the photos here before, I thought it was just OK and was a bit put off by the red marble countertop and floors. But they looked really nice in person and was always in pristine condition. The Hotel's location is also a plus. Even though the nearest MRT stop is quite a walk, Orchard Road and other shopping destinations you might want to go to are just a Taxi away and they're quite affordable as well.

What a great service! On top of that, the room was impeccable, a luxurious bed with a choice of pillows, exceptional lighting, complimentary mini bar (excluding alcohol), and a great view with a virtual private elevator.

The only problem is that you will probably over eat as selection is so large and with so many other great eating options, you need to leave some room for later.

We were greeted very warmly by a helpful staff member and as we were early for check in to the room we were escorted to the atrium lounge/bar and given complimentary coffees and cake which was very enjoyable. We were not kept waiting long before being taken to our room. We were congratulated on our wedding anniversary by a few staff members and I must say the staff were so warm and friendly and were very happy to provide suggestions (like upgrade to club access - well worth doing), tourist info and general info on singapore. If you do the club thing you are accommodated higher up with a lovely room, butler service (nothing is too much trouble), snacks anytime, breakfast at any of three areas within the hotel, afternoon tea, cocktails etc. The rooms by the way are elegant and very comfortable. Upon returning to our room after some shopping we had been left a chocolate mousse cake from the hotel deli which we enjoyed after dinner. I thought this was a lovely touch. The top three floors are connected also by a spiral staircase so you don't have to keep using the lift to get your snacks/drinks - this makes it feel quite discreet when you are in a snacking mood and they didn't mind us taking cocktails up to the room. Tea and coffee making is available in the room but you can also make one in the club room and even get a takeaway cup if you're on the go. The pool area is very good and the moment you take a sun lounge you are presented with ice cold water and towel, once again with a warm greeting. In the pool area is a day spa - a bit expensive for what it was but we did enjoy a massage before returning to our reserved lounges. The chinese restaurant at the top was a bit unusual in some of its offerings but we had the most delicious fish I've ever tasted which melted in the mouth. The gym is currently being remodelled but if you just want to use a treadmill or step machine it will do for now.

The double-headed shower rose was fantastic. The room had excellent curtains (remote-controlled) to keep the room really dark and nice for sleeping in. The only gripe we had was internet access. The hotel charges SIN $10 per 15min for the use of internet in the business centre which we feel is expensive for most travellers. Hotels in Singapore should consider providing internet access to guests free of charge or at nominal cost for limited-time usage, as in many hotels in many countries.

Be warned if you dont like heights, dont go out on the balcony on a high floor as it is quite stomach churning, although we personally liked it. Another must for great views is a trip in the external lifts which service the higher floors and Hai Tien Lo restaurant on floor 37, anyone can go to the top and the views especially of a night are brilliant. We only ate in Global Kitchen for breakfast as our deal included this, and again you could not fault it, there was plenty of choice for both western and eastern tastes, and again the service from the staff was excellent. Also it was open from 6 a.m which is great, if like us you have an early flight to catch. The hotel is situated quite close the Singapore flyer, thus away from the more hustle and bustle areas of Orchard Road, but still close enough to amenities to get about, it is also connected to both Suntec and Millenia shopping centres, which have a huge variety of shops. We did a lot of walking, and Raffles hotel as a focal point is probably 15-20 from Pan Pacific, however local taxis are efficient and cheap, and whenever we caught one from Pan Pacific the door man would indicate to us and the driver how much it should be, so that everyone knew where they stood, which helped. Pan Pacific is also right infront of the stop for the Singapore Airlines hop on hop off bus, which costs about \u00a36 each if you have flown with Singapore Airlines and produce your boarding pass, and is excellent value.

It was cheaper for me to phone a friend in the States for 15 minutes than it was to use a computer in the business center for the same amount of time.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cDeserves to be #1\u201d", "Author": "Targetsea", "ReviewID": "UR31273287", "Content": "I went wondering how the old PP could be the top pick for trip Advisor reviewers - how would it stand out from all the other big box hotels in the area? Well after a four-day weekend with wife and kids, I can only join in all the other reviewers praising this place. Great service, great rooms, great hotel. I would add that their pool side service is first class. All those free bottles of iced water. The gym has a good range of work out equipment in a largish space. The Rang Mahal Indian restaurant has fabulously good Indian food. Zambuca has good Italian food but a strained relationship between the kitchen and the staff. The Global Kitchen restaurant is good for the breakfast buffet, but dinner was more pedestrian (limited choice and not great execution on my roast salmon and prawn). Go for the burgers which looked terrific. On the other hand, the 25% early bird discount is perfect for families with kids - and my daughter says their banana split is the best she has ever had - and she is an expert. Had brunch at the Hai Tien Lo cantonese restaurant. The ordering system - a 'virtual' buffet you pick from a menu - takes some understanding. But the food has excellent interpretations of the usual Cantonese fair - and some interesting extras. Son says best duck he has ever tasted and he was born and raised in Hong Kong.

This happened on the 3 days that I was there not very good. It reminded me of queuing at a food van or some cheap all you can eat buffet breakfast in a Vegas hotel. Inside was not an experience I wish to repeat. I am not sure what sort of customers the Pan Pacific is targeting but everyday I had to put up with screaming children, or parents walking their little precious pride and joy through the food area to teach them to walk getting in the way of other people or kids playing on the floor while you are trying to walk through. The eating area is quite small but surely they could have an area where families could sit with the kids so that they do not disturb others. On one day a large family of 8 at a table stuffed one of their kids with so much food that the kid was sick on the floor. The family just wiped the kid down and threw the napkin on the floor beside the vomit and carried on eating. Many of the staff saw what had happened but nobody cleaned it up for the 15 minutes that I was there. Even the restaurant manager looked at it but did nothing. The family happily carried on gorging them selves on the buffet without even an attempt to get it covered or cleaned up. Very poor and disappointing.

We were completely satisfied with our choice. Getting to the hotel was a simple, grab a cab from Changi Airport which cost just $16 S for two persons and two pieces of luggage. Due to our late night arrival, the taxi queue was empty so the total trip took under 20 minutes. Check-in provided our first taste of Singapore hospitality. The process involved a unusual amount of manual paperwork during the filling out of which the check-in clerk engaged us with opening questions such as \u2018where are you from\u2019, \u2018how long are you staying\u2019, \u2018what are you planning to see / do\u2019, \u2018where are you headed next\u2019, \u2018what\u2019s it like back home\u2019, etc. While these questions sound like something straight out of the hotel check-in clerk handbook, the follow-on discussion left us with a sense that there was genuine care and interest about us as guests. Upon discovery of our itinerary the front desk offered us a complimentary late checkout till 6PM. The hotel did not appear busy and so delaying the turnover of a room by a day did not involve additional expense. For jet lagged travelers on the other hand, having a place to shower and change after a day in the Singapore heat was a god-send. The Pan Pacific Hotel earned a loyal repeat guest. We booked a room on the executive floors [# 22 and higher] in order to secure a view of the city skyline and which included breakfast, tea, and free internet. The views of the city were exceptional and we have many fine photo\u2019s our album. The internet was fast and robust \u2013 however getting connected required a wired connection in order to retrieve a password before using in a more convenient wireless mode. The room was clean and comfortable with appropriate finishes. Breakfast was tasty, nutritious, and filling. There was the usual assortment of European and American favorites including cook to order eggs. One asian dish \u2013 called 'dim sum' -- was included. We took our breakfast in the business center on floor 22 in order to enjoy the view and sacrificed an even larger selection on floor 3 in the main dining area. Since we had a late checkout we decided to try the afternoon tea\u2014served from 3-5. When we arrived at 4:30, we were the only guests and had a delightful array of pastries to choose from as well as a favorite hot beverage or cold juice. During afternoon tea we encountered our second exceptional display of guest service. The hostess came by and inquired if we had just arrived and then added that she had not seen us at the hotel before. As we described our travel arrangements we found ourselves once again talking with someone who seemed genuinely interested in our journeys. The Pan Pacific is built in Atrium style with glass elevators running inside and outside. Either elevator ride is a treat \u2013 on the outside one overlooks downtown attractions while on the inside, one zips up and down the interior atrium.

And on more than one occassion rather than being told how to get to an ATM say or the nearest entrance to the shopping mall, we were walked there by them. The hotel is massive yet you don't feel overwhelmed. I note the previous comment about the sound proofing between rooms, but it never bothered us. The restaurant on the 37th floor serves the best Dim Sum my wife has ever tasted apparently. It has a cracking location and when the marina is finshed, it will be the envy of the rest of Singapore, if it isn't already. I see comments about people not being able to walk to places, but that is for alot of Singapore. Taxi's are cheap anyway. I have to say that the tube network (although clean and comfortable) isn't the best, but they're still improving it. It appears the network is geared to getting the locals into the city from the outlying areas rather than having a station at every tourist hotspot. We were there for 4 days and the most we spent on our mad dash around Singapore on a taxi was Singapore $7 (around \u00a33) to take us from the hotel to chinatown at peak time via the ERP. The hotel is a 10 minute walk to the Singapore Flyer (which blows the London Eye out of the water by the way, there's even a small tropical garden underneath it!!). The boat quay, city hall and Merlion park all a 20 - 30 minute stroll, longer if you're married and have a credit card (not looking forward to that bill!). Shopping Mall Prices by the way are no cheaper than UK, in fact often higher. Bugis Junction mall had the more realistic prices. All in all a fantastic hotel and holiday. Would I stay here again - Are you mad!! I'd be mad not to! So why not the full rack of 5 stars across trhe board. Well 4 out of 5 for value. Only because they allowed us to keep our room until 7,.00 p.m. but charged us a half day's rate (they do provide a hospitality room for a hour for those who have late flights) but we wanted to relax before our flight and not have to rush. And me being an English northerner is always looking to save where I can, but hey they are a business and it WAS a fantastic room.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cAt Pan Pacific\u201d", "Author": "GeminiMumbai", "ReviewID": "UR28247723", "Content": "Breathtaking - that is how I would describe the view from the 30th floor of the Pan Pacific (where I was staying).

In the morning they sent up a free fruit basket and chocolates to apologise for the noise - even though we hadn't actually complained, just asked for earplugs!

I think that's not a bad price, though in my opinion, a five star hotel should be providing internet access free of charge to every single room. The pool is very good, and the gymnasium well kitted out. The use of these facilities each day made my trip particularly enjoyable. Small complaints? Well I know it's true at so many places in Singapore, but \u00a33.50 for a can of Coke (yes, it's delivered in a can) is a joke. Drinks seem soooooo expensive yet food isn't too pricey. Also, will anyone ever invent quiet plumbing? We've sent a man to the moon but is it really so difficult to make a toilet flush quietly? Not a big deal in everyday life, but to the jet lagged traveller being woken at 3:00am it's a huge pain. The soundproofing too doesn't befit a five star establishment. You really shouldn't be able to hear next door's phone conversations. Maybe that was because our room had a connecting door, but it's still not an excuse. So overall, this is a beautiful hotel.

Before I start, I'll say you cant go wrong with any, SIngapore Hotel standards are very high. So I'll be nit-picking in this review. Room : Comfortable sized rooms, nice full height windows, with electric blinds. All fittings excellent, room design is modern with LCD TV. Very good business table, with expensive ergonormic chair. Bedding faultless. If you're looking for grandeur, look elsewhere. But clean, modern design, this rocks. View: Great views with full height windows, but a balcony would be even better. I stayed at the Swissotel with a older, poorer room, but it had a balcony, and when u're on the 50th floor with a balcony, its unbeatable. There is nothing wrong with the view here, but I just prefer a balcony. Bathroom: Excellent. SHower is wall mounted, or hand held, comes with DUal powerful heads, so 2 people can shower at once and not have to share the water jet stream. Fittings are nice, but not grand. Location: I would say excellent, you're connected to 4 shopping malls, so even if it rains, u wont get wet. Its also very near the business area, walkable in 10 mins, but train is better, because SIngapore is hot. But still, it doesnt get 5 stars because the Train STation is 10 mins walk away (although its through beautiful malls, and airconditioned all the way). Swissotel is just right on top of the train station, 30second walk. But dont let this be a major consideration, unless you're gonna go back to the hotel 4-5 times a day. Value: Great. With UOB credit card, stay 3 nights for the price of 2. I recommend this hotel ! U wont go wrong. Definitely top ten in Singapore, but number one ? Hmm.... it lacks the charm to be number one.

Following all the good comments on Tripadvisor, we were curious to find everything out ourselves. The entry to the hotel is a bit hidden amongst various shopping malls and drive-ways, but once the taxi leaves you at the entry, you start the realise you are in a for a good stay. The lobby and registration desks are quite impressive, as is the building from the inside as well (from the outside it may look a bit less inspiring). Since we had received an email some two weeks prior to checking in requesting us to give the maximum of data already (passport numbers, addresses, room preferences), etc..., checking-in should be a matter of minutes. The evening we checked-in happened to be my birthday, and this was noticed by the check in agent, who asked to be \"excused\" for a second. Upon her return, we were told that we would be upgraded to a superior room, and that further registration would take place in the room itself. A very kind and genuinely interested customer assistant then continued to registration in the room, and we also received a birthday cake. We really appreciated this gesture, and it made a special day even a bit more special. The room was very nice, with nice modern interior, large enough for three day, and all details needed for a stay were available. Nice hard double bed, very silent airco, large TV, and like everything in Singpore, all very well-maintained and clean. The next three days, we really felt at home in the hotel. What makes the difference is that everyone without exception is just genuine kind and helpful, without being forced or \"artificially kind\". They are able to combine good service with a relaxed, feel-good attitude. The staff at the concierge-desk is there to help with any \"logistic\" question you may have on Singapore, with good inside-tips, help with reservations, etc ... We did not have breakfast in the hotel, and only had drinks in the top restaurant, so cannot comment too much on that. The last days, we spent some time at the swimming pool, which is pretty large for a city hotel, and where again, all details (towels, complementary water, newspapers, magazines) were taken care of. For business and privately, I have had the privilege to stay in a lot of nice and well-known hotels. There will always be a hotel which in some aspect (location, design, etc ..) stands out, but I never stayed in a hotel where I just could not find any negative point, and where the service was of such a constant very high level.

Tea, coffee and hot chocolate are available 24-7, again without further cost.. It's great to be able to pop in after a day of sight-seeing (or straight from a trans-atlantic flight, as we did), and know there are refreshments available. The hotel is very well located for access to the MRT stations, or for walking. Boat Quay, with its many restaurants, is only a pleasant 10-15 minute walk away, for example. Taxis in Singapore are cheap, so don't be afraid to hop in one if the heat is too much for you. Many cabs will take cards, but do check before you start driving! We enjoyed our stay so much, that we booked a room here for our one-night stopover on the return leg of our journey. Although the Executive level rooms are more expensive than the standard (and in Singapore, most hotels are expensive!), we felt it was worth the extra money (though perhaps not, if you don't intend to have breakfast at the hotel) for the level of service, and the fact that they could guarantee an early check-in.", "Date": "March 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "moonbather", "ReviewID": "UR25623803", "Content": "Stayed here for 3 nights on way back from Australia.

Large, sheltered, suitable for serious swimming and for small children. We rated it very highly. When approaching the pool an attendant immediately provides a towel and a bottle of cold water. The gymnasium is adjacent so one can work off previous excesses and cool down with a swim. We arrived very early at about 0800 expecting to put our bags into store. Very helpfully we were allowed to book into our room early because occupancy rates were low. Nevertheless this was a very good start. Throughout our stay the staff were friendly and very helpful. Rooms were cleaned twice a day. Like most 5* hotels, laundry costs were expensive, eg \u00a36 per shirt. It would be more cost effective to buy shirts from one of the adjacent malls and either throw them away or take the with you than pay for laundry. We stayed in a Deluxe room (which really means standard these days) which was very generously proportioned and the bed very large and comfortable. Beware the fully stocked minibar which has wizzard technology and anything removed for more than 30 seconds is automatically charged to you account. So if you want to make room in the fridge for something of your own, bear this in mind. We mostly ate out but food in the hotel was OK albeit slightly pricey. The same quality is available at much lower cost elsewhere. Two large shopping malls can be accessed directly from the hotel.

This hotel is right in the heart of the maria square area and is attached to the marina square complex. We arrived at our hotel at 1:30 am due to a delay in UA arrival. The hotel staff was extreamly friendly and warm even at this late check in. We got a great room and our bagged were taken up to our room waiting for us. The room was spectacular! All the ammenities you would expect from a 5+ star hotel. It felt like the spa treatment. The room was comfortable and all international plugs, etc. worked no problem. No adapators needed. The hotel is attached to a huge shopping complex (on of the national passtimes is shopping). We wisely, did not take the package for buffet breakfast as the shopping mall and Suntec city have a variety of places to eat that are substantially lower price than the hotel breakfasts. At night you can also go through Maria Square and get to Glutton Bay. There are a variety of hawkers that set up stalls here where you can sample a variety of local cuisines. Also great for Muslims, as many of the stalls are halal. Take the shuttle bus from the airport it only costs $8 SG per person. You cannot book the shuttle bus back from the hotel, but you can take a taxi. It costs around $21 SG for two people, so a few more dollars than the shuttle bus. If you really want to save a few dollars, then you can go to the Mandarin Hotel also attached to Mariana square, and you can book the shuttle bus from there. Would recommend you also get the tourist card at this mall, it's free and saves you money at a lot of the establishments within the mall. We saved quite a bit of money here! The downside of the location of this hotel is it is a good 10- 15 minute walk to the closest MRT station City Hall. You can walk underground all from the hotel, but it is a bit of a distance.

It sits in the fast-paced Market Square area of the city and is close to several great shopping mall complexes and the waterfront. It is not in the more crowded and hustling \u201cdowntown\u201d area where many other hotels like Marriott, Hyatt, Four Seasons, Hilton and Goodwood are located. The nearest subway station is a good walk from the underground lobby of the hotel. The four night stay was booked through Bookings.com and prepaid. I had a room on the 30th floor that had no great view, looking out on the fa\u00e7ade of the Conrad Hotel next door...not the best view and certainly, as it turned out, not the quietest. Before criticizing, I must point out that Singapore, its hotels and its airline in particular, currently seem to be the most hospitable in the world. From the time I boarded SIA flight 0001 in San Francisco, the courtesy, customer service and facilities exceeded anything I have seen elsewhere in many years. I would compare the hospitality and interest in guests\u2019 and visitors\u2019 comfort and welfare in Singapore to that of Bermuda in that those people in tourism related businesses seem to understand that service is the key to tourist good will and return business. I must also point out that I picked a very busy and special event week for my visit, even though I did not know this until I got there. It was thus an unhappy turn of events when, on my last night there, the party noise from outside the hotel was such that sleeping in my room was impossible. The volume of what some might call \u201cmusic\u201d and drumming that would overwhelm the most intense Koto Japanese Drum performance was unending, even for me with less than perfect hearing. The racket started at around 9PM and went on until after two in the morning. Several calls to the front desk yielded apologies but also the response that there was nothing they could do about it. Unable to sleep, I got dressed and went to lobby and the front desk where a serious, but affable night manager told me there was little they could do because the music was not coming from the hotel but from somewhere nearby. It was, according to him, a party for the drivers of the Formula One competition that was being held in the city that weekend. If in fact the Gran Prix Race car drivers were partying after 2AM on the day they were to take qualifying rounds on the city\u2019s newly build racecourse, it seemed unlikely that they would be doing much driving that day. In any case, the manager told me that even the police could not stop it and moved me to another room for the rest of the night. But my sleep cycle was ruined and I left for Hong Kong the next morning, hardly refreshed and having paid over $900 for the noisy room. Singapore has some of the strongest laws and law enforcement in the world. Penalties for even small infractions are strict and harsh, so it seemed odd that in this climate the city could not deal with such a disturbance. While it can be argued that this was an abnormal situation, I found it unacceptable at any price and the hotel had nearly tripled its usual rates for this event week. I think that when they do this, they owe a great deal more to the paying guest in terms of meeting normal expectations and common needs, such as a quiet night\u2019s sleep. My trip had nothing to do with the F1, but everything in the city that week was calibrated towards it, so heaven help the poor soul who, like me, just happened to be there then. The hotel offered no compensation, only apologies.

Upon arrival i noticed they have dedicated lines for Arrivals/Departures/Concierge etc, \"What a great idea\" i thought! The guy that checked me in was very polite and efficient, Before i knew it i was heading up the glass elevator/lift to my room on the 18th floor. The Atrium is amazing and about 40 stories high. Once i got into the room i noticed it had a bit of a Polynesian theme to it, As does most of the hotel. Truth be told the room itself is probably more of a 4 star but it's the facilities and staff that make this a 5 star hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the plasma tv had about 25 channels including Star World, Star Movies, Mtv etc etc. My room had a nice view of the Suntec Convention Centre and the Conrad Hotel. My room also had electronic blinds but didnt have a balcony, Apparently some rooms do, Some dont. I had a shower and bath, with decent tolietries in the bathroom. I also had a Clock with built in Alarm, etc. I didnt get to use the bar but i noticed each night they had live entertainment with a woman singing.

Our room was on the 19th floor (the top floor for deluxe rooms) and we were given a harbour view. The views were fantastic, although we used the outside lifts to get views from the roof top restaurant on the 37th floor. The room was plush. Extremely comfortable, with a superb bathroom attached. We had breakfast at one of the restaurants and I 've never seen so much variety on offer. We made the most of our short stay and so ate out in the evenings. The night life is at Clarke's Quay. We were also given a late check out of 3pm and the hotel locked our bags away until we returned at midnight. We were then given a 'temporary room' so we could shower and get ready for our flight, which was very much needed.

The staff are tremendously efficient and very friendly too. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony and being on the 29th floor, we had an amazing view. The glass elevators on the outside of the hotel are very impressive, if a little bit scary the first time you get in them. Its worth taking the elevator right to the top where the restaraunt is, even if you dont eat there, as its on the 37/38th floor (I think!) and the views over the city are spectaculor. Our room was really nice, however we had twin beds and not a double, but we pushed them together and they didnt seperate at night so there was no falling down the crack incidents! It really wasnt a major problem as we were only there for two nights. The bathroom was lovely too. It was quite big and had a really nice massage shower which we enjoyed very much. We didnt eat in the hotel as we ate out on both nights, but the menu did look nice with a variety of dishes. On our second day, after being shopping, we came back to the hotel to find a huge bunch of gorgeous lillies, a massive fruit basket and a chocolate cake with 'congratulations' iced onto it, which was really really yummy! The hotel is conveniently located and is attached to a shopping mall (one of many) which takes you to the MRT and then its a just a short ride away to the different parts of the city. We got a tourist day card for about $8 sd, which we felt was really good value. Be aware that you will be fined if you are caught eating, drinking or smoking on the MRT.

We were on our honeymoon and received a room upgrade to a \"panoramic\" view overlooking part of the city. The room had all the ammenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel, and some I'd never seen before - such as a sliding panel allowing you to connect a laptop/USB etc to the large LCD TV - along with a comprehensive set of video/audio leads to hook up your MP3 player to the in room speaker/TV system - a nice touch, but again shows the empasis towards business users. Another nice gadget was the remote controlled blinds/curtains. The 28th floor where our room was was reached by external \"capsule\" lifts. I don't suffer from vertigo but felt myself hanging on a few times!!. The hotel is part of a shopping/hotel complex. I felt the shops were all more expensive than home (UK) and was very much geared to the Japanese shopper. This whole complex was expensive proably due to its trendy shops, boutiques and eating places - there are much cheaper places to eat and drink.... I felt the food and drinks at the hotel were outrageously priced - especially for holiday makers - again, if a business is paying its not such a problem - a point I made on my customer satisfaction form. I was informed they were \"competitive\" with other hotels in the area - but as I later found not competitive with hotels in less trendy areas. As a result, the bars and restaurants were never full and only sparsley filled with busniess people on phones & laptops and as such didn't have a very socialble or relaxing atmosphere. By going to Boat or Clarke Quay - about 10 mins cheap taxi - there are plenty or bars & restaurants offering large discounts and freebies to get you into their establishment - all have a great atmosphere and are very reasonable considering the expensive drinks in Singapore. When I asked the concierge if there were any good places to eat - he didn't know or didn't want to tell - as he wasn't very helpful.

I got a good deal on expedia for the room rate, however, I found the services very overpriced. For example, using the internet in the business centre (which seemed very well appointed) was S$8.50 plus GST plus service charge (which worked out about S$10) per 15 minutes, whereas the internet cafe in the Suntec centre cost $5 per hour. A cafe latte in the atrium coffee bar was over S$12 and a glass of NZ sav blanc in the \"brunch bar\" was S$22 and a not particularly nice hamburger $20. The bathrooms are also well appointed with a small bathtub, separate shower and good lighting. The pool was a nice enough area with loungers, towels and water provided. Warning for people afraid of heights - all the elevators in the hotel are glass.

During my whole stay the mirrors and the shower haven't been 100% clean as you would expect it from a 5 star accomodation. On my date of departure I could see why, because the room maid thought I had already left. She rushed through the room and used my old towels to clean the shower cabin. The hotel pool is quite nice. I didn't use any restaurant, so I can't review these. Checkout was efficient and correct. Returning home, I realized that I forgot two pairs of trousers in a wardrobe in the room.

The hotel stay is by far my best lodging experience while traveling for work! Location - right in the center of the pricy colonial district. It's great for both business/leisure. It's got indoor walkway through a shopping mall to suntec center, so you won't even be exposed to the tropical humidity. Orchard Road (for shopping, not that there's not enough shopping within walking distance of the hotel), is only a brief bus/subway/cab ride away. Room - tastefully decorated in neutral tone. Bathroom has separate shower/bath. Bath tub is generously sized, I used it every night. The room has central light control, very much like any 4+ star hotel rooms in Asia (Japan, HK, Taiwan). Nice audio/visual capabilities w/ the flat screen TV and wireless internet ready. Food - I had room service about 4 times during my stay for both breakfast and dinner. The eggs benedict is one of the best I've had. Didn't have a chance to try the restaurants, but I dare say they probably measure up to the rest of the hotel services well. Amenities - large outdoor pool, which never got busy during my stay there (I had a direct view of the pool from my room). Service - extremely efficient front desk and concierge, no compliants whatsoever! Overall, I just wish that the 5 star hotels in the US could be as nice as Pan Pacific! Tips - Singapore is such an easy country to travel to. There's great shopping and food all around town. Many travel books suggest a day trip to the Sentosa Island. I did just that. However, I don't recommend at all, unless you've kids (even then, there are better attractions on the mainland). The island is full of man made attractions. I was not impressed with anything at all.

The treatment that I received from this Indian gentleman definitely will make me want to return to this hotel in the future. The negative side of this hotel is the club lounge. Staffs were not friendly and practised double standards. When I arrived at the 22nd flloor where their club lounge located, I couldn't locate it. When I got out from the lift, it is their reception area. No greetings or no approach from the staffs there to offer assistance until I approach them. When I went in to the lounge, a chinese lady came and approached us to offer drinks. I do enjoyed the evening snacks served and the view from the lounge. No one cleared the plates when we have finished our snacks. Therefore, I just put it aside on my table. There were only 4 tables occupied at that time and four staffs were on duty. Then, my friend from UK came and joined me for evening cocktails. The same lady came and asked for drinks order. She then only cleared all empty plates. I just felt it is discriminating Asians.

I suggest you sort the reviews by \"Lowest First\" if you want an honest look at this Hotels Reviews. During check in, the man at the counter actually tries to barter with me. He begins a whole act right in front of me, telling me that I had reserved a smaller, cheaper Twin room, for the same $200 rate. I disputed this, and he tells me that I am \"mistaken\". He takes it a step further and lies to me, saying there are no King rooms available anyways. Then an awkward silence, conveying that his decision was final. Astonished by this, and fully aware of what he was doing, I pulled out my reservation and showed it to him. King room with a view. Visibly annoyed he mysteriously finds me my King room with a view 10 seconds later. Not to be deterred, he then tries to upsell me. \"Sir, for $90 more per day, you can have free internet and breakfast\". I replied \"I am already paying $200 a night for this room. You basically just lied to me about my reservation so I'd take a cheaper room at the same cost. Internet should be free, and I dont eat $90 worth of breakfast every day\". He continued to try and persuade me. He would not take no for an answer. It was very uncomfortable and awkward for me. I felt like I was in a flea market trying to haggle for a bead necklace with a hippie. Then something surreal happened. He actually has the audacity to inform me - like its the first time he's said it - that he is giving me a Twin room. I started laughing. Seriously? He actually was hoping I had forgotten?? Unfortunately, this theme continued throughout my stay. The light bulb was out in my bathroom. The grout along the tiles was messy, and smeared. The toilet doesn't flush unless you pump it a few times. When I turned on the sink water, the handle moaned as if it were old metal. The magnet holding the door open doesn't work, so I watched the bellhop try 5 times to make it stick, unsuccessfully. Internet is $30 per day. Absolutely ridiculous. If you go up to the Business Center they actually charge $7.50 for 15 minutes of internet use. I mentioned this to a group of Indian fellows in Little India at an internet cafe, and they responded with roaring laughter. Laundry service here is $10 per shirt. Yes, per shirt. That works out to about $200 USD for an average load of laundry. I opted for their outside laundry service, paid $45 for one load (ugh) and my clothes came back wet. I couldn't make this stuff up, folks... On a Sunday night, I walked outside to get a cab and get some dinner. I ended up standing there for 40 minutes. Yes.... 40 minutes ... in a line with 30 other people, and it was 97 degrees outside. Fully drenched in sweat, I went back in to the hotel to the concierge and said \"Are you aware that there are 30 people standing in line for a taxi outside?\" He apologized and started calling to have taxi's come by. I should point out there were six employees standing out there with us the whole time, doing absolutely nothing. The day I checked out, I had overslept and was late for my flight. I conveyed this to the concierge and meekly asked for a taxi as soon as possible. As I stood outside, I watched the hotel staff fill up 6 metered taxis with people from the Taxi line, while I stood there, without a ride. Turns out they had called the \"more expensive\" taxi, which I did not want or need. It costs twice as much, and took 10 minutes longer to arrive. Great idea guys! Make that money!!! To top off this already disappointing stay, the more expensive, late taxi driver dropped me off at the wrong terminal. He knew what airline I was taking, yet despite the mercedes and double-fee, he apparently didn't know his job well enough. Remember, I was late for my flight. He takes off, and I had to pay another taxi driver to take me where I needed to go. There are a lot of exceptionally shining 5 star reviews on this hotel, here on TripAdvisor. To the tune of literally hundreds. Way more than one might think is normal. Way more than the other hotels in the same area of Singapore, even right next door.

Registration was completed in a kind & efficient manner (took few minutes not long at all). Our bags were brought up promptly by helpful staff to our room on time. Bubble lifts (matrix space-age looking): Clean glass with user-friendly lit buttons. The speed of lifts were appropriate to observe the atrium and amazing views of the hotel\u2019s interior. In the lifts on our 3rd day, a staff member kindly greeted us and pronounced our surnames correctly. Very polite and accurate! Panoramic Room: Looked brilliant and felt luxurious to stay in. Clean, neat & spacious. Fitted bedding for 3. Plenty of room for 3 large suitcases and shopping bags (which grew larger with each mall visited). Room nicely furnished. Electronic blinds, shades and LCD TV were easy to use. Air-conditioner worked well to our temperature liking. Received free bottles of water each morning plus newspapers. Slippers and robes were also supplied. Mini bar was stocked with goodies (extra charges for eg bottled water from mini bar $4 SGD) and there was also room to store our chocolates in the mini bar. Room was on level 18 and we did not experience any distractions/loud noise. This room had a balcony with beautiful views of Singapore City (Esplanade, Merlion and Marina Bay). Bathroom: Immaculate, neat and polished. Fluffy towels, well-positioned mirrors and nicely accessorised with cute little bottles of shampoos, conditioners, bath gels and bath salts. Hair dryer was handy. Beds: Clean, comfortable and spotless white sheets and pillows. We all slept peacefully well. Swimming Pool: We were busy shopping and left little time to swim at the pool. Nonetheless, on our last night there, we did relax on the seats next to pool and observed the beautiful mini garden scene. Hotel: Magnificent! Check-in and check-out was completed by courteous and polite staff. Check out was prompt and there were no delays to our next destination. Before leaving the hotel room, I had postcards to send back home and staff also helped mail this out within a telephone call. Excellent customer service! Concierge staff were excellent too for taking our luggage out the entrance while we shortly waited there for our driver to pick us up. The door man kindly took a photo for us. Hotel staff are approachable and willing to help. All staff greeted and smiled at us gracefully throughout our stay. Location: Easy access (by taxi or walk) to Marina Square Mall, Suntec City and Esplanade Theatre. Taxi to Orchard Road (5 minutes around $7). Taxi to Sentosa Island around 12-15 minutes (depending on traffic flow). Buffet breakfast @ The Global Kitchen: Delicious and nicely presented food from both Western and Eastern cultures. Courteous staff. Food ranged from prawn dumplings, grilled fish, smoked salmon, stir-fried noodles, scrambled eggs, toast, has browns, mini muffins, dragon fruit, melons, yoghurt, jelly and much more ($35 SGD). Thank you note: ( we have not included our feedback comments on the hotel's online form, instead we will write it here). It was our great pleasure to stay at Pan Pacific Singapore.

Bad idea because they didn't know about the package I booked and kept asking if I got the right hotel.

Before everything sinked in on us (of the royalty welcome), right away the luggages were taken from us by the very attentive hotel staff. We were escorted by Ms jennifer & Ms Ana to our room and checked us in personally. My son had truly a heyday when he saw the bubble lifts. We even had our picture taken in it, which was given to us as a souvenir. The deluxe room was wonderful. The very comfortable bed and sheets felt like heaven. We enjoyed the room immensely, so much so, we didn't want to leave it at all. The showers, bath tubs and toilet were great. So clean and water was great. We also noticed that bathroom amenities like shampoo, conditioner, lotion, etc... were replaced right away with new ones, even as much twice in a day. What more can I say. As a frequent traveller, this has been the best hotel experience ever. Have stayed in a lot of 5-star hotels, but nothing compared to this... hotel staff, experience, service, facilities and all. The level of service is truly amazing. There are so many staff on hand to help you with anything you need. No need to turn or twist your head. They all speak excellent english and are really willing and happy to help. In fact, the person who we paid for theme park trips had commented and informed us that Pan Pacific was truly the best hotel in Singapore.

Having read the reviews, we had high expectations of this hotel, but were sorely disappointed. Booking through hotel site \u2013 Major hassles. At some stage used the hotel\u2019s on-line email facility. Received a reply from them only AFTER our 2nd day there! Eventually wrote to an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 email address that I found on the site and received a reply and booking. Reception \u2013 physically what we would describe as a Sixties horror \u2013 over the top and cold. (Know this is a personal like/dislike) On check in, NONE of the things that we requested on the online \u2018visitors profile\u2019 that they require you to complete when booking, seemed to have made it to reception. We were allocated a room with everything but what we requested. Granted it was sorted out, but why bother with completing this form if noboby pays any attention to it anyway. Room \u2013 When you pay US$200 plus for a STANDARD room, you would in most places in the world expect to walk in and have some \u2018wow\u2019 factor. The only wow we had was one of disappointment. The room is a reasonable size, but it is basically stock standard. As stated in other postings, the balconies do not allow for any \u2018sitting outside with a drink and enjoying the view\u2019. Apart from the high concrete balcony, there is no furniture on the balcony. It is inexusable that in a hotel of that class there is no furniture on the balcony. Bathrooms \u2013 Separate bath, shower and toilet, but small Staff \u2013 Nothing to complain about, but not what will be remembered as warm and friendly Furnishing - Beds were comfortable, pillows were not. The rest is so so for a hotel of this class. Accessability to restaurants and shopping \u2013 right next to a few big malls, else Orchard Road, Clarke Quay, etc easily accesible by taxi (at present the only viable option) Prices - we found the price of food and beverage in the hotel quite expensive. As stated in previous postings, the mini bar is not well stocked, so you either buy from a nearby supermarket or pay the room service prices with all the added charges. Business services \u2013 Considering that Singapore is such an IT centre and the price of internet elsewhere, it is ridiculous what the hotel charges. Did not use other services, so can\u2019t comment General \u2013 They are renovating the hotel and we had the cables running past our balcony which limited our view and privacy.

Maybe my expectations were too high following our stay at Raffles the Plaza. We had paid extra for a deluxe king bed balcony room, check-in at 10.30pm on Tuesday was busy but efficient. We were given the key for a room on the 13th floor. Waited about 10 mins to get in a lift, and then found the room had twin beds. I called reception, and this was sorted out quickly and efficiently without any question and we were moved to a new room on the 15th floor. The room was nice, but a bit bland. Bathroom has a small bath, small separate shower and a partioned toilet, so good for sharing. The balcony is large, no balcony furniture (seems to be typical in Singapore), but concrete, so even if you drag chairs outside you can't sit and admire the view. The view overlooking the bay and the Oriental hotel was great. The bed was huge, but not very comfortable and the bed-linen was quite worn. Good Flat screen TV and a small mini-bar area, not very well stocked. Music from the ground-floor bar was quite loud, but did stop well before midnight. The really annoying thing was the pinging noise from the lifts that could be clearly heard from the room, even though we were the other side of the atrium from the lift shafts! Luckily we are both heavy sleepers... Maybe the rooms and the noise levels in the suites on the top floors of the hotel are better. The main lobby area of the hotel is huge, impressive to look at but a bit cold and impersonal. As expected, the hotel was full of business travellers, they hold a lot of conferences here. As tourists, we stuck out like sore thumbs in (smart) casual clothes, and didn't feel we fitted in as well as at Raffles the Plaza. The pool area and the bar next to it was gorgeous - complementary towels and water was a nice touch. Very clean, serene area with a huge beautiful pool. The spa next to it was ok, although my husband was in agony after his sports massage! I tried the room service one evening, and was very impressed - fantastic meal, excellent service and presentation, reasonable prices. The hotel is one of four hotels connected to the Marina Square mall which is huge (great food court upstairs) and next to Suntec City which is even bigger, so good for shopping, and is walking distance to the bay areas, Boat Quay, the business district etc. We popped into the other hotels to have a look, they all have the same large lobby / atrium design with similar 'bullet' lifts. The whole area just seemed a bit to similar, miles of the same thing.

The Pan Pacific have a grandious lobby, created like a triangle, and you can see straight up the hotel and all the floors, with glass elevators going up and down, some on the inside (floors 1-22) and some on the outside (23-36, the executive floors). We were upgraded to the executive floor on the 26th floor, after some really nice and very good communications with their hotel manager. All the communication directly with the hotel through email was excellent and they responded very quick. The check-in went really smooth and fast and our luggage were sent up afterwards. We were greated in the room by a spectacular view from our executive business room, wich balcony and a lounge chair on the balcony. There were a fruit and chocolat basket as welcome, as well as one very beautiful, asian, robe, as a gift. The room was spacious with a queen bed with very nice down feather cover and pillows. Flat screen TV and a good sized desk for business. Wireless was excellent and fast. The bathroom was big, with a separate shower and bathtub and a separate toilett as well. The only minor part that was not that good, was the storage room. The closests were all spread out in the wall between the livingroom and the bathroom and were small with may compartments. Bathrobes and flippers existed, which is always nice, as well as complemantary water bottles every time the room was made up. The hotel is quite big, but far from the biggest ones. There are many restaurants in the hotel, which are supposed to be very good as I have read online and in magazines that are about Singapore that I found in the room, like Time Out Singapore. We tried the Japanese restaurant, which I don't remember the name of, and it was at least top 10 sushi I have had. We dined at Zambuca, their Italian restaurant, which was excellent. A great restaurant and the food and service was superb. Really a restaurant to recomend. If there is one thing that I actually was a little bit dissapointed at, was their breakfasts. They had three, or maybe four, breakfast restaurants to choose from, and we tried two. The one for the executive floors, are on the 22nd floor, smaller breakfast, but a bit more private and not so many guests. The other one was on the 3rd floor and had more options, but more lunch food then breakfasts food. The thing missing in all of their breakfasts, are the usualy western way of eating a sandwich/toast to breakfast; chees, ham, turkey, pastrami and these kind of things. Maybe the do not eat that in Asia? The pool area is very nice with a good size pool. Nice and comfortable sun chairs and excellent service, like free water and fruit.

The hotel is very central and is within walking distance of the Singapore tourist places. There are always taxis to take you further afield, however ensure the Mercedes taxis put you on the meter, otherwise you will pay the limo prices.

I had booked a trip to the Night Safari with a company who were going to pick me up from there, the time came and they didn't show. I asked the conciege help desk to make a phone call. It turned out they came but i was supposed to wait in the lobby, not outside, and the bus left.

I bought a camera which had a european charger (i hated electronics shopping in Singapore), and couldn't charge until i noticed there was in fact a international plug in my room. I called an electrician at an early hour in the morning to convert the voltage so i can use it, and within seconds he was there to help.

We didn't have the chance to partake of the breakfast since we were in town to attend a conference in Suntec City. But me and my colleague had a nice time riding the external glass elevators (the ones which look like crystal eggs on the side of the hotel building) up and down. It was an experiment on removing some of my fear of heights. We didn't have to use our room card key to use this elevator (unlike the internal elevator which we needed to use the card key so we can get to our floor). Yes, there was a bar on the lobby and due to the open design of the building some sounds do tend to be heard when you're near the internal elevator area of the lower floors. But once you're inside your room, you won't hear the sounds anymore. The staff are very friendly (as compared to other staff members in some of the Singaporean hotels I've stayed in). It was pleasant dealing with them. It was a pleasure staying in this hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Service\u201d", "Author": "mumisme", "ReviewID": "UR7279575", "Content": "I stayed at the Pan Pacific on a 24hr stopover on my way to Australia, I was traveling alone and was apprehensive about staying in a strange city on my own.

We would definately stay here again and would have no hesitation in recommending this to any readers out there The City Hall MRT station is a short walk away and if you cut through the City Link Mall, you can get to it in air-conditioned comfort.

We were not long off the flight and not too hungry, so ordered soup to start and then 1/2 Crispy Peking Duck for main to share. Only the duck skin was served in the pancakes and after we finished that we got our duck meat mixed with noodles (although we felt this had been taken from a sparrow, as there was not much meat at all!).

The food was very good and not too expensive given the standard of the hotel. We had drinks and cocktails in the lobby which although expensive weren't outrageous. Although the hotel is mainly used by business people, it was perfect for tourists too. The pool area was great for cooling off after a days sightseeing. As soon as you arrived there you were handed an ice cold towel and a bottle of cold water to spray yourself with. Would definately recommend this hotel.

We booked it on Expedia, which offered a package that included a S$40 per diem \"food and beverage\" credit (\"Panoramic Balcony Room-Leisure Package\"), which we applied towards the bar, one room service delivery, and two meals at the Japanese restaurant (excellent and authentic, by the way). By the way, you cannot apply this credit towards either the Italian Zambuca (also good) or Indian Rang Mahal restaurant because they're run by third parties, not Pan Pacific. THE AREA The hotel is fairly conveniently located, about a 15-min. (brisk) walk to the City Hall subway station (via a series of connected, air-conditioned malls) and just across the street from a major conference center. The lobby is large and features many comfortable sitting areas. The Keyaki bar had a happy hour that included some tasty, Japanese-themed hors d'oeuvres. THE ROOM Our flight from Hong Kong came in around midnight and so we informed them early on of our late arrival. We'd figured that they would hold our room until we arrived (we'd requested a king-sized bed upon booking) but it appears they did not because they gave us a room with two double beds instead. Even though the room was a no-smoking room, there was a definite, if faint, smell of cigarette smoke in the room. Could have been the ventilation, of course. This was on the 9th floor and it was OK. They said we could request a room change the next day. They did this and we ended up staying on the 20th floor, where there was no smell of cigarette smoke. (Even though we'd booked a \"Panoramic Balcony Room-Leisure Package,\" we did not actually have a balcony. I saw balconies only on the lower two floors, in fact, so I don't know what's up with that. As it is, we wouldn't have used the balcony anyway because of the heat outdoors.) The room was good-sized and comfortable to lounge in. The desk was large and same with an office-type (fancy) Aeron chair, aside from a comfy chair in the room. The bathroom included a strong-pressure shower as well as a large, deep bathtub. The lighting was bright and there was plenty of countertop space to spread out our vanity items. The delivered our choice of newspaper each morning (the International Herald-Tribune in our case). BREAKFAST I'm surprised that a previous poster wrote, \"the free breakfast offered as part of the package was continental style, which was very good but did not include cooked items like bacon, eggs and sausages for which you had to pay about $5 extra.\" The standard continental buffet breakfast in the Atrium (lobby) was indeed free (with our room rate at least) and included a big spread of many items, including scrambled eggs, bacon, and sausage, as well as cereal, juice, lots of fruit (watermelon, dragon fruit, pineapple), salad, croissants, rolls, jams etc., and some Asian items (tofu and other things I did not recognize). There was enough variety to satisfy us during our seven night stay. Aside from this buffet in the main lobby, there was an outside buffet area (Summer House) that cost a bit more (less than S$10) and offered more cooked options, such as eggs benedict, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches, etc. as well as the same (actually bigger) buffet spread as the one in the lobby. So the hotel pretty much had the breakfast options down pat. SPA/GYM My wife and I took advantage of the on-premise Wellness Spa to get massages. I enjoyed my basic 55-min. massage. She got a foot reflexology that was not quite what the brochure described or what she expected. She did not particularly enjoy the experience. I used the gym two or three times (AM and PM) and was pretty impressed, although I cannot compare it with other hotel gyms, as this was a first for me. They had several walking machines, riding machines, and weight machines. The staff was helpful in explaining how to use them all. I overheard some guests and it sounded like some of them are repeat visitors to the hotel and gym. Attached to the gym is a locker room and sauna/shower area, so they provide a good, useful service. Gym is open till 11 PM; the pool is open till 10 PM. I saw many families with young children using the pool. BUSINESS SERVICES We booked time on one of their computers in the 22nd-floor Executive Center so we could do some web surfing. It's quite a rip-off (S$8 for 15 min.) but when you don't have other choices, you just do it. Of course, later I found some Internet cafes charging just a couple Singapore dollars for half an hour, but they weren't anywhere near the hotel. We did see others using this center, however, so it is a useful service for some guests. We also saw some conference rooms full of business people in meetings. CUSTOMER SERVICE I asked the concierge questions throughout our stay and always encountered a friendly, helpful person -- same as the service when I called from my room. If they didn't know the answer, they called me back within 10-15 min. COMPLAINT As others have written, each night there's a lounge singer in the lobby bar whose voice travels all the way up the central atrium. The singing lasted from about 9 PM to midnight. I think a quieter jazz combo might be just as welcome to hotel guests, but this singer seems to have sole rights to entertain everyone. Even so, the noise didn't really bother us because on the 20th floor, she wasn't too obtrusive. If we'd stayed on the 9th floor for the whole week, we might feel different about things. \"FEAR FACTOR\" If you book one of the executive suites on an upper floor (I'd guess mid-20s+), access is exclusively from one of the external-facing elevators. This could cause some amount of anxiety if you're scared of heights because the view covers many square miles of the city. We took one of these elevators to the top-floor (37th) Hai Tien Lo restaurant (but didn't eat there) and although I found the ride to be fun, doing it several times every day might have become nerve-wracking, especially when hovering on a floor that's not your own to let others in and out. In our case, we had to use an internal-facing elevator to reach the 20th floor, which wasn't so bad.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cGood location, good value\u201d", "Author": "beijau", "ReviewID": "UR5623739", "Content": "Although I normally stay at the Fullerton and prefer to stay at the Four Seasons, when the money is coming out of my own pocket I have a soft spot for the Pan Pac.

Oh well, smile and think of the price you're paying. The same atrium design that I find so cheesy in their San Francisco property kind of works in Singapore. I haven't taken issue with the lighting, by the way; the overall design is not much of an issue unless you want to spend your time inside. With so much air conditioned real estate including untold hectares of shopping malls to be found elsewhere in the Lion City, why hang out here except maybe for champagne in the lounge? Well, let me answer my own question. The spa is competitive on features (lots of rooms, massage treatments), price, and availability. Try getting a massage booking on the weekend in Singapore without many days' advance notice. Good luck! But I like this spa so much I buy discounted block tickets and go back while staying at those other hotels.

It was our first trip to Singapore, so we did not know what to expect. Thankfully, we enjoyed our stay very much. We checked in to our hotel on the 20th floor, a non-smoking room with a king sized bed. It was nice, spacious, and very clean. The best thing about the hotel is its easy access to public transportation. To get from the hotel to the City Hall MRT (train) station, you don't even need to walk outside, just through air-conditioned malls and walkways. The MRT takes you almost everywhere you could want to go, although for some of the more far-out places (like the Zoo or Bird Park), a cab is quite cheap and is easy to get from the front of the hotel. We took a cab from the hotel to the airport in the early morning and it only cost S$14. The Pan Pacific is located in the Marina Square Mall. If you love shopping, there are two other malls all within walking distance and connected to each other (Suntec City Mall and Raffles City Mall). Make sure to visit the Fountain of Wealth in the Suntec City Mall and follow the ritual! Also, take advantage of the many money changers in the mall. Try to get small bills if you can ($5 and smaller) to use for train fare as change is limited to $4. The hotel is very centrally located to everything. It is walking distance to museums, malls, the Esplanade performing arts center, famous Merlion, Clarke Quay (pronouced \"kee\" for all us clueless Americans ;), riverboats, restaurants, and more. So very convenient. The hotel is beautiful, with glass elevators on both the inside and outside. Take the outside elevators all the way up to the 37th floor - the restaurant floor - for an exquisite view of the city. On the fourth floor of the hotel is a pool (which looked very nice but we did not use) with an outdoor bar and a gym (also very nice but they apparently do not have water so bring your own). Our only complaint was the loud music from the hotel bar, which was only made worse by the hotel's beautiful atrium design. The music kept going even past midnight, which surprised us because the other reviews here seemed to indicate that the bar music stopped earlier. If you are a light sleeper, or a business traveler who has to go to bed early to wake up early, you might not want to stay here. We are incredulous that management would allow music that loud to be played that late. It did not bother me as I am a pretty fast sleeper, but I woke up one day to find that my boyfriend had stuffed a towel under the door to try to minimize the sound! :( We did not find the front desk or the concierge very helpful or particularly attentive. Our room was prepaid but they tried to charge us again for some reason even though we brought the print-out receipt so be careful! As for the concierge...bring a guide book or buy one in Singapore! While maps are readily available for free at all visitors' centre, a good guide book is a must. Despite all of that, we found that our calls to their help line, ServiceOne, for wake-up calls were met with great friendliness and professionalism by Sue. Our room was impeccable, with a nice bathroom (separate shower and tub and toilet) and nice amenities. Bottles of water are provided daily, as are a free electric hotpot and instant coffee and tea packets. Very nice to start the day off with coffee and a free copy of the Straits Times! Internet access is only provided free if you upgrade to an executive floor. Otherwise, it is S$10.50 for one hour and is also offered at a lower rate for 6 hours or 24 hours. This charge seemed to me to be quite unnecessary as it was wireless anyway, and I would guess that many of their travelers are business travelers, due to its proximity to the Convention Center. Oh well. We prefer to eat outside of the hotel on trips, and so cannot rate the bar or restaurants. Finally, a word of caution. There is some construction going on somewhat near the hotel--the building of yet another train station. This construction is outside of Suntec City Mall and in my opinion is not close enough to be a noise problem. However, we felt that walking around in that area was pretty difficult, given the road closures. You can, of course, take alternate routes. We only walked around there one time, to go to visit the Raffles Hotel. All in all, the hotel is very nice. If we visit Singapore again, we would most likely try something else as there are a lot of hotel options to be had. However, the Pan Pacific is worth a first visit.

There wasn't really too much of a down side to be quite honest but, in common with many chain hotels in large cities, the PP is a bit impersonal. That didn't bother us though as we just used it as a base. The main thing to note is the lifts! Do NOT stay here if you don't like heights. The lifts from reception to about the 22nd floor are inside the atrium of the hotel and are very impressive but they are glass sided and vertigo sufferers will freak out. If you are on a higher floor then you need to use similar lifts on the exterior of the hotel... you have been warned! Great views though if you like that sort of thing.", "Date": "March 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFirst Clas Stopover\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4583446", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Pan Pacific on a SIA Stopover and found it excellent in every respect.

A real plus is the immediate access to both the SunTec and Marina Square Malls.

As I was there for 2 weeks this meant I was upgraded to the residence floors, 27th floor. If you're scared of heights you won't like the lift up the outside of the building. Views from the room balcony were great though. The residence breakfast was terrible. The hotel reception atrium is very impressive. When you arrive you really think this is a great looking hotel. This is a little misleading. The rooms are a little dated, while the bathrooms are very nice, the TVs are quite old, the bed is not very comfortable and the decor is a bit faded. The wireless internet is also a bit unreliable. The hotel bar is a nice place to spend 30 minutes, no longer. There is a singer on at the bar every night and due to the atrium design they can be heard in your room even on a high floor. If you want to sleep before 11pm, good luck. The hotel restaurants are quite good, particularly the indian, but very expensive compared with the world outside the hotel. The pool is very good although the service is a bit lacking there. It's a hunt to find a towel and there are not many loungers.

Bathroom all glass, mirrors and reddy brown marble with walk in shower cubicle. Our room had a desk with the comfiest chair ever. Due to the atrium design, the hotel is \"hollow\" so imagine the sound echoes, but we weren't affected. We were on the 17th floor with a view looking inland. Had requested a harbour view, but that was the only disappointment. The atrium is awesome, as are the glass lifts. If you are staying on or above the 23rd floor, your lift goes up the outside of the hotel !! Service absolutely superb. Location almost perfect, just a short walk from the famour Raffles Hotel. Would recommend to anyone and will stay again if we ever revisit Singapore on a stopover to Oz. One last recommendation for eating is the Newton Hawker centre. A collection of stalls serving every type of food you could want. Great food, great drink, great value, great atmosphere. It is where the locals eat. Enjoy.

This hotel was not really our first choice but Ritz-Carlton and Shangri-la Hotels were both booked on the days we were in Singapore. No regrets because Pan-Pacific is just superb. Although we did not get the room with the queen bed (they only have a twin-bed room at check-in), we were pleased with our room. It has nice furnitures, very clean and quite spacious. The bathroom was large, modern, classy and of course very clean. The usual 5-star amenities were there (in-room safe, slippers, bathroom robes and toiletries). We were on the 7th floor and we can faintly hear the nightly music from downstairs but it did not bother us at all. The view from our room is not the best, just buildings like the Mandarin, Marina Square, etc. I guess we can't complain since we only paid $50/person/night(I'm sure I need to pay more than that to get a top-notch view). Staff were courteous and very accommodating. Breakfast was not included in our room rate. We did not try breakfast at the hotel since they were serving American buffet. We wanted to try the local food so we were mostly eating in places around the hotel. The best part is the hotel is coveniently located and so close to shopping and commercial centers. You don't have to go too far since the hotel and shopping complexes are somehow connected to each other. We LOVED the concept since one does not have to go out (it was so hot and humid outside) and you just walk inside an airconditioned complex. Overall, we had a very lovely time at the Pan-Pacific and we will definitely stay at the Pan-Pacific Singapore whenever we find ourselves in that part of Asia.", "Date": "October 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay there again\u201d", "Author": "Ryleeh", "ReviewID": "UR4052774", "Content": "Totally agree with the previous poster.

Recently stayed at the Waldorf Astoria, New York and said \" Not bad, but it is'nt the Pan Pacific\".... you get the picture) ANYWAY Upon arrival, you are greeted by hotel check-in staff (not porters) and escorted across red carpet, through its lavishly decorated entrance, through to check-in. After being further escorted to your room (we had a 25th floor room with amazing cityscape views), your luggage arrives. This service continues throughout your stay (namely, after calling the concierge for a power adaptor, one arrived at my door within 3 minutes!). When we checked in, we were treated like film stars. However, the fact we had come off a 12 hour flight, stank of free booze and were dishevelled in our combat trousers, t-shirts and trainers never altered the staffs attention. As previously described, our room had awesome views down over Raffles, Orchard Road and the city sprawl beyond. The room was huge with a 7ft wide bed and an impressive marble bathroom with modern fittings. Location wise, its great. You are within minutes of the SunTec City shopping area and can walk almost half a mile from the hotel through to an adjoining shopping mall which takes you close to Raffles towards Orchard Road and the quay areas. You need to bear in mind that this half a mile walk is within the comfort of an airconditioned mall and this benefit shouldnt be dismissed in the Malaysian heat/humidity. The pool is superb, with changing area and impeccable poolside service. The inner atrium is a sight to behold and the atrium bar a classy place to have a drink before you jump in a cycle-rickshaw on your way to dinner at Boat Quay or Clarke Quay. Bear in mind, this hotel costs around \u00a385 a night and undercuts nearly every hotel in the world on its value for money then surpasses so many with its service.
