The apartmemt we had was not truly an apartment as it has only a bed/kitchenette area and separate shower room but it srved a purpose for our visit. The apartment was new and very clean, the kitchenette ws adequate for cooking breakfast but ill equiped for cooking more major meals. The hotel only has the bar in reception as a meeting place which limits the social apsect if travelling with a group of friends unless you meet in the rooms. There is a rather strange arrangement of an outdoor atrium inside and some gold statues - has to be seen really. Location is good and we managed to walk everywhere we need to get to from the hotel. Our room was top floor and faced the atrium so we had no issues with noise.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, quiet, spacious!\u201d", "Author": "Bharfot", "ReviewID": "UR124978730", "Content": "We had an apartment at the third floor for 9 days and absolutely loved the stay. We expected a small room with kitchenette, but got a big separate kitchen with table and chairs and even a washing machine. In the morning when we hadn\u2019t had time to do the dishes we even returned in the evening to find that someone had done them for us! The bathroom was nice with a big built-in shower space and good water pressure, and even a greekish statue in one corner. The main room was freshly renovated with Ikea furniture and flexible lights for work and relaxing. The bed was somewhat on the hard side, though, probably because there were no sprung mattress and the relatively thin rubber one was placed directly on wood. Alle the rooms are situated at the inner courtyard and are hence very quiet (the street outside is also a quiet one). The building has a small elevator, but you still have to climb half a staircase to your room, so for the physically handicapped it might not be optimal. The wifi worked well most of the time, with occasional fall-outs late at night (I work as a journalist and often finish my articles during the night), but always worked well again next morning. Location is super, central without being in the middle of the hustle and bustle. A 5 min walk through a small park takes you to the S-Bahn at Nordbahnhof (or to a good bakery), from where you can go to Friedrichstrasse in two stations, Potsdamer Platz in five. There is also a tram that takes you eastwards to the Prenzlauer Berg area, or you can walk straight south to the area around Oranienburger Strasse (one station by subway) where you find all sorts of nice, small and not to expensive restaurants and pubs. A 15 min walk to the west will take you to a great museum of contemporary art, Hamburger Bahnhof (so named because it is located in an old railway station), or even to Hauptbahnhof, the main railwaystation in Berlin. All in all my only regret is that I didn\u2019t have time (due to laziness and early morning screenings at the Berlinale Film Festival) to try the hotel\u2019s renown Russian breakfast. It is said to include both blinis and Russian caviar, on Sundays even champagne, and I will definitely make sure to try it the next time. We very much wish to return to this great place.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belo Horizonte, MG", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for your money\u201d", "Author": "Arquimedes O", "ReviewID": "UR121075945", "Content": "The hotel is an old building, although fully renovated. The owners are obviously of russian origin, and this is why you have many interesting and beautiful art pieces scattered through the hotel - paintings, sculptures, etc. Also because of the russian origin, you can have the delicious pleasure of having real russian caviar in your breakfast! The location is great - a quiet street very near to Nordbanhof, where you can take S-Bahn and U-Bahn. If you like to walk, you can reach the center of Berlin also on foot, it is not very far. Staff is great and helpful. The only problem we have encountered was with the bad quality of wireless Internet in our room - I think it was too far from an access point, so it did not work sometimes. The kitchen is fully equiped, and besides the dishwashing, you have a washing machine also! The apartment is big and clean.

The windows have a view of the bicycle racks and dumpster in the courtyard. The bathroom is huge and wheelchair accessible. But unlike most wheelchair-accessible bathrooms, it does not have even a shower curtain; there is just a showerhead on the wall, suitably far from everything else. The hot water is reliable. The mirror is lit only from the right, so I shave the left side of my face blindly. There is insufficient room between the desk and the bed for comfortable seating at the desk (definitely not wheelchair-accessible), the lighting at the desk is poor, and there is no open outlet nearby for a laptop or cell-phone charger. I obtain a power-bar from the front desk, but have to run the cable across the bathroom door. Eventually, I rearrange the furniture, moving the desk to a space on the other side of the room where there is an open outlet, and leaving the bottles and phone on the floor. But nonetheless, for an average of just \u20ac45/night (including fast and reliable Internet) over my six-night stay, it's pretty good overall for the price. The bed is comfortable (though the pillow is the standard large-but-mushy kind that Germans seem to favor), the room is very clean and quiet, and the front-desk people are helpful. The hotel promotes the quality of its breakfast buffet (\u20ac11). Overall, it's about average, but in my experience the standards for breakfast are high in German hotels, so even average is actually quite good.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cNo frills but good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Soujourner69", "ReviewID": "UR61030804", "Content": "I've stayed at the Hotel Zarenhof during my last two visits to Berlin and definitely have no regrets about it. The hotel itself is more like a privately-run enterprise, located in one of the multitude of old building blocks central Berlin is made of. And while it is located within what seems like a quiet residential area, you're still within easy walking range of both the next subway station (about 400m) and the railway (about 300m). Even a leisurely walk to Berlin Central station will take you only 15 minutes. The whole thing apparently has been refurbished from former residential city-block to hotel/guesthouse, but that ain't a bad thing. According to the traditional architecture for living quarters in Berlin, all rooms face the inner courtyard of the building complex and are separated from the street by another layer of walls and an outward facade. Upon checking in, you receive the key for your room, which also doubles up as the key to enter the building via the main entrance (separated from the lobby), so it somehow feels like you got an apartment of your own where you can come and go as you please. The rooms are nothing to write home about, but they are big enough and clean. Breakfast is served in a dining-room that seemed to be a bit small to mine eyes, but the buffet had just the variety I'd expect... if not a bit more.

Wall memorial (right next to hotel). The place is quiet and clean, and it is a bit quaint but in very good ways. For example, they don't have a lift, so I was offered a small room on the ground floor, or a large one on 3rd floor. I took the latter, I don't mind stairs, and the room was huge; its corridor would qualify as a room on its own. Another good quaintness is the breakfast, you get blinis and caviar and salmon as advertised. Of course you probably can't have caviar for breakfast day in - day out, but the breakfast is not to be missed, at least once. One complaint I have was their wifi internet, it only functioned for one evening, and then it was terribly slow. All the other evenings I could not even connect to it. I wanted to use the net for some adhoc trip planning, and the hotel allowed me to use a computer in the lobby, also very slow. Had I known, I would have just left the laptop at home and done all my planning in advance (as I usually do.) So, be advised: if you need internet, stay someplace else.

There is no lift, though bags were carried to our room. It is a quiet neighbourhood with a small park nearby. We doubted the walking distance from Nordbanhoff station - they say a minute, we say 30 secs. The station has three separate entrances - at least!
