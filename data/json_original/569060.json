The Blue Mosque is within walking distance and the grand bazaar is very close. We felt the location was very convenient for getting around the old town. There are many stores in the area to pick up things you may have forgotten or lost along the way. There are also many restaurants in the area that I was told by other members of my group were nice. The breakfast buffet was good, there was an egg station and a decent amount of choices. There is a well stocked lobby bar that is pricey but nice...we enjoyed a few drinks there. The first room we had was the dredded inward facing room that has a \"window\" to the ventilation shaft and was the tiniest room I had ever seen, but did have 1 large bed rather than 2 twins. The second time we had a much larger room with a window that opened to the outside. The beds were comfortable but had minimal pillows; just the 2 on the bed and no extra in the closet. The rooms were clean, the shower stall a bit awkward but overall a nice room.

Our room on the 5th floor also had a balcony which afforded us a view of the Blue Mosque which was quite nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant is a challenge if you don't speak Turkish. Now about that smoking thing. We were on a \"non-smoking\" floor, yet the room reeked of smoke.

There are a lot of Doviz (money exchangers) with great rates for either buying or selling located on the populated street, Ordu, on way to Blue Mosque or Grand Bazaar. Hotel lobby had nice modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor. The best part of the hotel is the view from the terrace! Pool looks nice, but we had too much to do in Istanbul and no time for the pool. The breakfast and buffet dinner was excellent, but same each day. Rooms also had modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor and were very clean. Since, the Gate 1 tour group we traveled with started and ended at this hotel, we were able to stay in two different rooms. The first room had 2 twin beds. The beds were hard and the sleeping arrangement was uncomfortable for a vacation as a married couple. The room was spacious though and the bathroom had a big bathtub. The shower was great. However, you can hear your neighbor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s above and below you through the bathroom ventilation. This room was located toward the front of the hotel and was very noisy. The hotel has a 24 hr restaurant which keeps the music going till 2am. The hotel should suggest the restaurant at least turn down the music at midnight so its guests who are trying to recover from jet lag can get some sleep! The second room had a soft for euro standards queen bed and although overall the room was smaller and had a stand-up shower only, it was much more comfortable for us as a married couple. Still the loud music could be heard until early morning. Overall, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d recommend this hotel for location and best view from the terrace.

A hidden jewel of Istanbul!\u201d", "Author": "volcano_rush", "ReviewID": "UR62932051", "Content": "We stayed 8 nights at the Mosaic Hotel and this is our review of our experience: Great service from the moment we walked in! We received a very helpful & warm welcome from 'Arzu' at the reception desk - she even gave us a choice between two rooms! All the staff were extremely helpful and tended to our every request, whether that was at breakfast, in the leisure centre or anything to do with room service. They always gave us tips and directions to eating places of our taste; like Pizza hut & Domino's Pizza & helped improve our knowledge of transport links like the Tramway & City Buses. We stayed in a twin room on the 3rd floor (No. 302) the lift was right outside and was really quiet. The room was in fantastic order and the en-suite was in top condition; with everything working as new! The shower was lovely & warm. The room had an LCD tv (with BBC World service), air con and all the nice extras! Our room had fantastic signal strength to the free Hi-speed wireless internet service; which was a life saver during the Iceland Volcano disaster. It allowed us to keep in touch with all airline, airport and embassy websites at any time of the day or night - avoiding huge phone call bills to these establishments from a hotel phone! Our laptop was a life-saver and is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmust-take\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 item. The roof terrace was a popular spot for us twice a day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once at midday and then late at night! It had a wooden swing which was so relaxing we often fell asleep! With uninterrupted 360 degree views of Istanbul, it definitely is one of the tallest Hotels in the area. The indoor fitness & leisure centre had all the new gym equipment and great staff to help you out. The pool, jacuzzi, sauna & turkish baths were awesome and immaculately clean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like they were brand new! My 4 year old daughter & I used the swimming pool every single day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is made available to guests from 12 to 6pm. The Mosaic Hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the old city and is close to all the transport links and pedestrian routes - getting you to all the attractions in no time. I advise checking out Google Earth to plan your trip as it has the location of the hotel saved if you search for it & places of interest nearby. As well as having a look at the Istanbul transport maps before you go; such as tram, train & metro routes - just Google it. The Suleymaniye Mosque is only 0.6 km (10 min walk) & Grand Bazaar is also only 0.6 km (10 min walk). The nearest tram stop is Laleli-University Stop (0.35 km, only 5mins walk). The cost is only 1.5 lira (only 43 pence UK money) and each journey allows you to ride as long as you want one-way! That means you can travel 10 stops to Kabatas in 20 mins. This gets you near to Taksim, the new city & the well-known Taksim Square with a Pizza Hut! We loved Istanbul & all the Historical buildings and museums. As a Muslim family; the highlights were all the mosques and islamic architecture like Suleymaniye mosque, Sultanahmet mosque (The Blue Mosque), Beyazit Mosque & Topkapi Palace with the Islamic relics of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his Companions. We also travelled to Mini Turkey (MiniaTurk) which is a park full of scale models of famous buildings from all around Turkey & a few famous ones from Jerusalem. The Grand Bazaar was an exciting experience with amazing things to buy and admire. And it's great for those who love to haggle and knock down the price on everything, like my Mrs & me! There was also a bazaar around the side of The Blue Mosque (called Arasta bazaar) which is a must-see! The only thing we didn't like was the Turkish food...such as donners, fried fish and meat dishes. With no Pakistani restaurants anywhere around, we certainly missed our traditional cuisine. Instead we stuck to Pizzas & fries. Our best experience (of price and quality) would be to recommend Domino's Pizza in Aksaray. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 15-20min walk in a straight direction away from the tourist sites or you can catch the tram & get off at the 'Heseki' stop. Another thing to be keen about is the money exchange rates. Money Exchanges are called 'Doviz' and the most profitable one was behind the Laleli-University tram stop which gave a rate of 2.285 Lira to 1 UK pound. There are two there, but the one slightly further up, nearer to the Kent Hotel gave the best rate by far!

Overall I realIy enjoyed my stay at the Mosaic and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a clean, modern accomodation that is also conveniently located to tourist attractions.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ithaca, NY", "Title": "\u201cBrand New, Beautiful, BUT working out the kinks...\u201d", "Author": "Al-Burj", "ReviewID": "UR15160851", "Content": "My family and I stayed at this hotel twice in March, 2008. We were on a guided bus tour with Gate 1 Travel and stayed here at the beginning, and again at the end, of the tour. When we arrived in mid-March the hotel had JUST opened and they were putting the finishing touches on it. The hotel is BEAUTIFUL and brand new. It is in the old part of Istanbul so the roads to it are quite narrow, but the big tour bus did manage to get us to the front of the hotel. The staff was very friendly and spoke English. The rooms were very nice too, small by American standards, but well appointed as you can see from the pictures. The rooms have those card readers inside, so there is only power when you put your room card in the slot. Also the hallways have motion detecting lights, which is cool, unless you are standing in front of the two pretty (but small) elevators and the light shuts off while you are standing there. There is a restaurant in the hotel where we had breakfast and dinner and both were very good. The basement of the hotel does have a sauna and small gym but I didn't get a chance to try them. The hotel is a short walk to the Tram line, the Leila Universite stop. It is also walking distance to the Grand Bazaar. If you leave and plan to take a taxi back to the hotel MAKE SURE to get a card from the front desk. The card has the hotel's address on one side and a MAP of the hotel's location on the other. Being a new hotel no taxi (taksi in Turkish!) knew where it was and the card was very helpful. There is an internet cafe near by and lots of small stores, restaurants, cafes that cater to the college crowd. Note that the Turkish computer keyboard is VERY different than the English \"qwerty\" keyboard. The hotel did have wifi, but see below. The Hotel is NEW and there were still some problems that would crop up. For instance for a little while if you called the desk from your room to request a wake-up call, their computer would give them the wrong room number. The second time we were there the shower leaked from under the marble bar beneath the doors, basically from the base. Also, when we returned our tour bus arrived at 5:30 pm, and apparently they had allowed a pervious tour group to check out at 5 pm, leaving only 30 minutes to prepare 40 odd rooms! The hotel had wifi throughout, but only the wifi from the lobby would work. This was frustrating as the signal was strong in the room and entering the (front desk supplied) password would seem to work, but it wouldn't. Nobody in our tour group was ever able to connect from their rooms, just the lobby. There are a few other small things, but they were all because the hotel is new and I'm assuming by now those issues have been resolved.", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cJust okay\u201d", "Author": "queeni1129", "ReviewID": "UR14363205", "Content": "We were starting our honeymoon in Istanbul and stayed here for 3 days. The room served it's purpose and it was an okay stay. It's a bit shabby, but we spent most of our time outside of the room exploring the city. The double bed was 2 twins pushed together, flat/hard typical European beds. The bathroom was clean, but it was a challenge stepping in/out of the tub at 5'1\". Breakfast was provided every morning and it was okay. Most of the guests were Eastern European or Arabic. There was usually one front desk person that could speak English. The surrounding neighborhood definitely catered to Eastern Europeans based on the shops. Our driver from the airport warned us that the area was not safe at night due to the clubs in the area. So, we didn't explore much at night. Once we got our bearings, we were able to walk to the Blue Mosque area, which is where I would recommend staying since there are so many restaurants to choose from. There was only one sidewalk cafe near our hotel. Grand Bazaar is in walking distance as well, but be prepared to be ripped off. Overall, it was an okay stay, but would not stay here again just due to location and lack of restaurants in the area.", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Mosaic", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d569060-Reviews-Hotel_Mosaic-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$129 - $242*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Vidinli Tevfik Pasa Cad No 21</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Vezneciler</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34490</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "569060", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/de/ad/dead3e2337321d260efd087ee01621664large.jpg"}}
