Although we didn't bring animals, it was so nice seeing them around the property which was kept neat and clean even with pets. We loved spending the early evenings on the patio with the fire pits going and great background music. The room was spacious and decorated so well.

Especially well-tuned is the cheerful, intelligent staff. For a pleasant place to stay in downtown San Diego, you can't go wrong with the Indigo as a less traditional and more personal experience. The downside factors result from an obvious decision to save costs on common services that are not immediately visible, for example: the breakfast experience. The hotel does not have a full service restaurant but blends a bar and tables into an attractive eating area. The problem is that the food is far beneath the quality of the hotel's physical and human appeal, below even the meager offerings of a downscale franchise chain. We're talking \"croissants\" that are limp and rubbery, one kind of bagels (egg) that are as hard as a rock, and no jams or preserves except for little plastic containers of Smucker's grape and mixed-fruit jelly. Except for the good coffee, the breakfast is strictly school cafeteria-quality. For a hotel that often charges over $250 a night for a room, this is really unacceptable. Other missing services are also noticeable, for example I found no place on site to buy sundries or newspapers (they tell you to go down the street to the 7/11 to do that), although copies of USA Today -- if that can be considered a newspaper -- are provided. If the Indigo corrects these problems, it'll inspire more repeat customers.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "Kate518", "ReviewID": "UR127367925", "Content": "I was in town for a convention, and enjoyed a great week-long stay here.

We chose to stay there because we were making a quick weekend getaway to San Diego and wanted a hotel that would accommodate our two senior Golden Retrievers. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by the valet staff and the front desk. The hotel has been modernized and is nicely decorated with sea themed colors and a water feature in the lobby. We noticed patrons with dogs in the lobby and at the bar. We were told that the rule about dogs is that there are no rules and referred to the 9th floor observation deck and bar where dogs can join their owners in an evening cocktail, use the grassy potty area well supplied with doggy poop bags, or romp in a little fountain/dog reflecting pool. I am a dog lover, and make sure that I am a responsible dog owner. But I was not sure what to expect. To my delight the facilities are well maintained, modern, and very clean. The observation deck/bar had comfortable seating, heaters and a couple of fire pits. Dogs and their owners enjoyed the space harmoniously and those who had not brought their dogs enjoyed socializing with the visiting canines. I would have given the Hotel Indigo 5 stars, but there were a couple of draw backs. Though the room looked great with durable dark wood laminate floors, modern furniture with simple lines, and a well-appointed, spacious bathroom, the bed was a big disappointment. The mattress was on the hard side which is tough on me because I have a bad neck, but the worst were the small hard lumpy pillows which guaranteed that I woke up many times during the night in pain. The other smaller disappointment was the tv channel selection. There are no rental movies available. If I had been traveling alone, I would have whipped out my computer and watched movies on Netflix, but my husband and I were tired and wanted to watch a movie on the tv rather than have to huddle around a computer screen. If this hotel invested some money on decent pillows and upgraded their mattresses, it would be a straight up 5.

Sergio, the concierge/Service-Person-Extraordinaire arranged to have two cars take our group to dinner, and the next day when most of our group went to board the ship, my husband and I had to do some last minute shopping. Sergio arranged for a car to take us to the nearest mall, give us his number so when we were ready to go he would return to the hotel, grab our bags, come back to the mall, pick us up and take us directly to the cruise ship terminal. Amazing! We looked at many reviews on TA before booking this hotel, but in the end we chose it because several of the couples we were travelling with had already booked it. We are so glad we did! It was truly a lesson in getting what you paid for. Oh, and by the way, the bed was very comfortable, the view we had of the stadium was unreal, the temperature, sounds in the hotel (or the lack thereof), and toiletries were all above par. We briefly enjoyed the rooftop bar/lounge with great fireplace table and apparently a little strip of grass. I think it is even dog-friendly! (Check to be sure.

The taxi trip to the hotel at 9:30 pm cost about $14, although the taxi had trouble deciding how to get there due to the one way streets....so the cost could have been slightly less. On the way back, the door-man suggested I take the limo waiting, rather than the three taxi's around the corner....he said it was the same price. However, at the airport the limo driver said it was $20. So I'm not too happy with that. I did notice an Indigo Hotel newspaper (ie. USA Today with an Indigo Hotel sticker on it) inside the limo, so I assume they work together somehow. The room is quite nice. It is very spacious considering this is a downtown hotel. The bathroom was large, as was the walk-in shower...no tub, but not a problem for me. The ammenities were nice, and the room was clean. The overall layout was also nice, and different with a curved wall, from other hotel rooms. I didn't realize this was part of the ICH chain (ie. Holiday Inn, Crowne plaza). The bed quality seemed to be OK. For whatever reason, I just didn't sleep very well, with the room being too hot or too cold depending on when the HVAC system kicked in. The front desk staff was very friendly, and showed a lot of energy. They seem to know other guests by name, so I think they pay attention to those people staying longer. The WiFi worked nicely. The login was easy, and you could connect both laptops and Blackberries at the same time....other hotels may only allow you to log in using one piece of electronics per room.

It's not luxurious, but it has some panache and doesn't disappoint relative to pictures on the website. The rooms have wood floors, a nice touch. Ours had a curved wall at the closet, breaking up the usual rectangular hotel room monotony. Colors and wall patterns are warm and agreeable. The same goes for the hallways, which gives a welcoming and comforting feel to arriving at one's room. Views can be good. The bathroom is spacious, functional and attractive. Beds are OK, nothing special, which, unfortunately, is the norm in lots of, but not all, hotels. There's no refrigerator or microwave. I think it's $10 a night for the frig; I don't know about a microwave. That's too much for such a simple convenience and was probably the thing I felt least positive about during our stay. To be able to store a few snacks that require refrigeration isn't much to ask. At least internet usage is free. You have a choice of either wifi or ethernet. The lobby is welcoming and bright, casual with character. A couple of iPads and iMacs (running Windows, oddly) are available for use. There's an adequate 24 hour exercise room and a pleasant 9th floor terrace overlooking Petco Park. There's not a pool, which was fine on pleasant, but not hot December days. But I could see where some would find this to be a shortcoming. The staff is helpful, pleasant and professional. I'm fine with saving energy and expenses by not providing new towels, toiletries and such every day, but I'd say that room cleaning could have been a bit more thorough. A couple times, we'd been to the beach and tracked a bit of sand into the room, nothing at all extreme, but it was there. It would have been nice had it been swept or vacuumed more carefully. Not to overstate it, though. The room was sufficiently clean. The Gaslamp District is touristy to the point where we didn't bother with it, but even for those taking advantage, I'd think being just outside it, as this hotel is, is a big plus for avoiding excess street noise. It's not exactly quiet, but for an urban location, it's not bad. I like the East Village location, surrounded by condos. It feels a little like living there because of that. The nearby and underrated ballpark gives great ambience as it dominates the neighborhood with a sort of mythic presence and easy views into the stadium. It's minutes away from Balboa Park by car and a walk to the harbor. Some nice SD neighborhoods (South Park, North Park, Hillcrest) surround Balboa Park and having them so close is great for restaurants, cafes and walking around. Other in town beach areas aren't that far, either. The light rail is just a couple blocks away. Valet parking is expensive (though the valets are great), but there are some good alternatives. On some nights, street parking is easy. A couple of nearby lots are $5 for 10 hours on weekdays/nights, $10 on weekends. There are other lots, too. Careful, though \u2014 on the street, the police will ticket you if you give them the chance. All in all, we had a very nice stay here.

They put me in room 202 which was a handicap-accessible room on the second floor (202), possibly because I prepaid using a discount rewards program. It was fine for what I paid (about $100 a night), but if I had booked directly with the hotel I would have requested a room change. The room was very large and in wonderful condition. Three minor points: there was a pipe that made a clicking noise in the heating vent in the bathroom which was annoying, but by closing the bathroom door I was not disturbed by it. The hot water turned lukewarm on 3 of the 5 mornings I used the shower at around 8 a.m. Third, room 202 is above then kitchen so I could smell breakfast cooking in the morning and steak and burgers at night. If this is a turn-off, make sure you are not assigned room 202. The bed was extremely comfortable. Free wifi. Window in the room opens for fresh air which is also nice. Large closet for all my stuff. I ate in the hotel dining room one morning for breakfast and it was ok. The scrambled eggs with spinach were good but the potatoes were cold. With coffee and tip it was nearly $20. The rest of my stay I ate around the corner at Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys which I recommend for the best bagels in San Diego. They make a variety of sandwiches and with coffee it was usually around $8. Service was very fast and friendly. There are a couple of other bars and restaurants within 1-2 blocks of the hotel; a Thai place, a bar/restaurant/bowling alley, Basic pizza (very good!), Smash Burger, a 7-eleven one block toward the baseball stadium, and a CVS on Market ST and 6th? There is a Starbucks two blocks away too if you require one. The neighborhood is called East Village and it is about 3 blocks from the Gaslamp District. I liked being far away from the madness of Gaslamp but close enough to walk there anytime, even evening. The closest trolly stop is on Market and Park, another 3 block walk. The further east you walk (toward the trolley stop) the sketchier the neighborhood becomes, but I had no problems. I probably would not walk off Market street alone a late at night in that area by the trolley. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego; and many are in this area too. However I was never bothered by anyone; no one even asked for a handout. There is always police presence at the Market and Park trolley stop. I did not have a car and used public transportation to get to the zoo, La Jolla, Old Town, Harbor Island for a whale watch trip. You can buy an all-day pass (includes trolley and local bus service) for $5. A great buy as the taxis are a bit high. I did take one early in the morning to go from the hotel to the Sheraton on Harbor Island Drive (3 miles) and it was $16 and a 10 minute ride. Took the bus back for $2.25. Seaport Village is within walking distance, 10 blocks directly east toward the harbor. You can literally see the Petco Stadium from the hotel. It's 2 blocks away. I pre-booked with SuperShuttle online and had airport to hotel (and return) shuttle service for $16 round trip. A great bargain and painless. Shuttle was waiting for me at the airport after I got my luggage.

He told me a certain amount of money was going on my card and then charged the entire upgrade fee to this card folded up the receipt and said have a great day. I walked out looked at the receipt and he charged the full amount to this card. I went back in asked why he did that and I got the deer in the headlight stare. Third: I stayed here because it was assigned as a low rate on a third party website. Well the room was too small for my family we asked for a larger room the request was granted for 60 additional per night we were fine with that because we were going to eat up the cost we paid and stay elsewhere. Well we should have stayed elsewhere. On my second day there I get a call from my credit card company saying they detected fraud on my card because of three different authorizations of which I was not aware of I let them know I was staying there but that did not matter so I currently have a lock on my account until I provide the cc company with receipts. The hotel charges 75 for each day you are there and on one night they charged me 13 dollars and no one had an explanation as to why it was done. I asked on more than one occasion to speak to the hotel manager with no response he either was not in or could not be found. I also requested that he phone me on my cell also with no response.The last night we were there I walked into my room which had not been thoroughly cleaned a dust pan was left on my living room table and apparently the maid broke something in our room because my one year old daughter picked up a large piece of glass and handed it to my husband.

We ate at the restuarant for dinner just because we liked the hotel so much and it was empty, quiet and beautiful. Overall, I'd give the food four stars. My wife's squash ravioli (with braised short ribs and chevril cream sauce) was 5-stars, though. My swordfish was great, too. It was all a little pricey though.

We found the hotel to be modern , quite new and is in a good location for sightseeing and for restaurants. We had a Kind Bed View room which was spacious, modern, clean and ver comfortable. We had a corner room on the 7th floor with a direct view of Petco Park. The room had good airconditioning, large tv, writing desk, an excellent bathroom with large shower and good water pressure. The king bed was very comfortable with numerous pillows, which I found to be too soft. In saying that, I found all pillows in the US to be the same. Breakfast was included in the room rate, available on the ground floor in the bar area. The menu was limited to a variety of eggs, fruit and juices. You nearly always get a side of toast and potatoes - potatoes I find a bit strange for breakfast!!. The breakfast is covered by a coupon to the value of $20.00 so it depends on your selection as to whether you pay extra. We found this happens alot in hotels across the US. The staff were friendly, the free internet ivia 2 new computers in the lobby was welcomed. The bar served good drinks for our night caps and also some food (limited menu) for those late hunger pains. There is also a roof top bar so when the baseball is on, you can sit up nthere and watch the game. Drinks are not served in glasses, but in plastic cups, whcih I do not like to drink my wine out of plastic. The reason behind this is some guetsts of the hotel decieded it would be fun to throw their glasses over the balaconey to the street below, where neighbours complained. The hotel was close to the tram to take you to the old town (approx an hours trip). There are some good restaurants in the area.

Here are our notes by category: Location: we loved the location. It was right on the edge of the Gas Lamp District, so out of the fray and hectic environment of the District, but close enough to access all of the things to do there. Amenities: the gym is awesome. Perfect amount of equipment and when we went (mid-October), there was always equipment available to use. They have Life Fitness equipment, which is a great brand. There are two TVs and it can get a little loud with the acoustics in the room, but overall, we were very pleased with the gym. We had coffee/tea in the room, which we enjoyed. Free wireless was a plus, but we didn't use it very often b/c we were out all of the time. The iHome clock radio was nice as we did plug in our iPod. Overall, the amenities were just right. Restaurant/bar: not impressed with the food quality or service. It's not that it was bad, but we expected a little better after reading that the hotel supports local fare. With all of the other dining options, we forewent the convenience of the hotel for any meal and ventured out on the town. There is an outside bar on the 9th floor, but we didn't spend any time there outside of doing a brief walk through. Room cleanliness: the room was very clean. Having hardwoods, especially in a hotel that allows pets, was a plus from the cleanliness factor, but we heard our neighbor early every morning as she walked around her room in her high heels. There were a few items missing when we checked in (no bath/shower mat, missing coffee/tea and mug), but they brought them the next morning when they cleaned the room. The housekeeping staff was pleasant. Overall, the rooms were clean (which I would expect no less) and we would give them a middle of the road on comfort b/c of the noise from the hardwoods and it feeling a little more industrial than we're used to. Staff: this is where we felt the hotel fell short. The bellman was nice and asked us lots of questions (where we went that day, how our stay was, etc.). But, the front desk staff was not as personable. It was not that they said/did anything wrong, but they just weren't as friendly as we had read about in reviews. We had handful of requests during our stay at the hotel and they were slower to respond and did not follow up. If I had not read the reviews about the staff being so wonderful before we came, our expectations would have been lower and it would have been normal, run of the mill hotel staff. But, we had higher expectations, which we felt were not met. Again, it's not that they did anything wrong, they just weren't what we expected after reading the reviews. Overall, we would recommend the hotel with some reservations. If you are looking for more upscale, plush rooms (like the US Grant), this is not your place. It seems best fit for younger (30's and 40's), more mover/shaker adults.

There is a security conscious as you need a room key to go up the elevator. My room was attractive in a funky and non-standard way as one wall felt like an experimental painting mural of yellows, reds and blues. It was interesting but not distracting. One thing different from most hotel rooms is the wood flooring. It is dark brown and a change of pace. Decor was also interesting and fun - a nice change of pace. There wasn't a tub but a nice glass enclosed shower that provided a nice stream of water pressure. The bed was fine and one had to move two rather large square pillows and a cylindrical pillow aside to enter slumber. But the four pillows used for sleeping offered no support. While many other hotels give you a variety of pillow (foam, polyester, down, etc.), these pillows felt cheap and lacking support. This could be an area of improvement. Aside from the pillows, another area of improvement is the heating/AC. Although there was a thermostat, it always seemed a bit on the cool side. I noticed one evening it was not set to automatic and the fan was on. Be sure to check yours. Internet is free! Yes, this is a shocker and welcomed.

I know that seems high but it's open 24 hours and the attendants are extremely professional and very fast. I honestly dont think I waited more than 3-5 minutes for the car each time. Also, they were extremely helpful with directions when asked. HOTEL & FRONT DESK: The hotel is really beautiful. When you walk in, you certainly have a regal boutique feel. The decorations are tasteful and up to date. The front desk was very friendly, quick yet attentive and helpful. David checked us in and he was very sweet. The lobby has two computers downstairs w/ free internet and free printing. This was helpful when I needed to print my plane ticket. They also have free internet in the room GYM: Decent sized gym. Exactly what we expected. Enough equipment for a quick workout and very clean. If you want a real gym there is one right around the corner called FIT. RESTAURANT: Kind of expensive but that's to be expected at a hotel restaurant. Strong drinks. Good food. THE ROOM: As you can see from the pictures I attached, the room was really gorgeous. We stayed in room 814 and I suggest requesting a CORNER room. The view of the stadium was really nice and the sunlight in the morning so wonderful. This is a dog friendly hotel but you would never know it. The floors are wooden which I LOVE so there is no dirty carpet smell. The bed comfortable and the linens extremely clean. Lots of channels to surf on the flat screen tv. The bathroom was big BUT the only only drawback was the shower. While it's a nice big walk in shower, the shower head looked kind of cheap and did not give off much water pressure which left you standing in one place trying to get wet and not freeze. They really need to put in a nicer rain forest shower head to fill up the space and make it more luxurious feeling. In terms of maid service, some of the other reviews Ive read says they didnt replenish or clean every day. This is a GREEN hotel people. You have to hang the \"Please Service My Room\" tag on the door knob when you leave for the day for them to come clean. LOCATION: The location is on the outskirts of the Gaslamp Quarter but honestly it's SO close in walking distance to all the bars at night etc. If you're gay, rent a car and it's a short distance to the Hillcrest area.

In fact I really like the location/neighborhood. It would be the must stay place if in town for a Padres game with a very cool gastropub (Knotty Barrel) across the street. The room was nice and clean - I really liked the wood floors. The whole reason we stayed here was because it was a LEED hotel and wanted to check that out. The one thing that people should be aware of is that it is a pet friendly hotel....that did not bother me - but it may some people if they have allergies or not into animals. There was some barking on our floor but it was not disruptive - but something to consider, again, if you are not an animal lover. We had a drink at the roof bar - great views - but limited selection. The staff was friendly and helpful from check in to the valet drivers. When we stayed there I was thinking that I was all set to give 4+stars, but then we had a negative situation with the management/housekeeping. Upon arriving at the airport my husband realized he left 2 shirts behind laying on the bed as he was packing. Yes, it is his fault that he forgot them - but he immediately called the hotel and they said he needed to email the manager of the lost and found as he was not working at that moment. He emailed him requesting that the shirts be mailed and that he would cover the cost for the shipping and any inconvenience this caused. When we did not hear back - so we called the hotel again and they said he was the person we needed to speak with and he was off. 2 days later we received a succint email saying the items were not found and to call the housekeeping manager if we had further concerns. We called her immediately and she said she did not have the items in her lost and found, but would check again and return my call. She did not return the call so I called again the next day and left a message and still we have never heard back from her. This was disappointing on many levels. Yes I realize that it was our responsibility to remember the items - however - we callled immediately and were sent through a lengthy process of days where obviously someone saw the items and claimed (stole) them. I find this very disturbing that the housekeepers or other employee would find it \"okay\" to take something left behind in a room. I understand if something goes unclaimed for weeks or months the hotel has to have a way to deal with the items, but we called the day we checked out, sent emails and followed up to no avail. It is not that the items were expensive or unique - it is more the principal of the matter and how poorly Hotel Indigo handled the situation. I think they may want to set a policy for their housekeepers/employees that taking something that is left behind by a paying guest is theft and not acceptable. So if not for that incident it would have been a 4 stars - but could not give more than the 2 stars because it left a bad taste in my mouth!", "Date": "September 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cAwesome - First time traveling alone...\u201d", "Author": "P S", "ReviewID": "UR117776921", "Content": "Hey you...

Reasons for lowering the rating: 1. The Hotel has started a Friday Night DJ, not enjoyable if you are trying to get to sleep and it runs till a little after midnight. When the front desk was phoned, they said that they had moved people from another room already, but there was nothing available which would be quiet. Also, since the room was paid for in advance the Hotel would not refund any portion of the money paid for the room. 2. Breakfast menu is not near as nice a it used to be previously.

If I didn't know it, I would never guess it was owned by Holiday Inn. It has a downtown boutique feel and attention to design that is very unusual in a chain. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The valet always asked us if we needed directions, and the gentleman who checked us out did the same, along with giving us a breakfast recommendation. The front desk called about 5 minutes after we arrived in the room to ask if everything was okay. The room rate was very reasonable for what we got: a huge room decorated in a lovely orange and blue color scheme, Keurig coffee maker, sleek, modern and VERY clean bathroom with lots of granite and beautiful tile in the huge walk-in shower with frameless glass door. Lots of little extras like a full size hair dryer, bottled water, an ipod docking station alarm clock (make sure to dim it before you fall asleep-- it's bright!)... and did I mention the view? We're Priority Club members, so they gave us a free upgrade to a king-sized room on the 8th floor with a view of Petco Park. Amazing. The elevators are fast and secure (you have to insert your room key to use them, which I liked), and the hotel is environmentally friendly. Apparently, it was the first hotel downtown that was ever LEED certified. The last night we were there, they slipped a letter under our door offering us to stay there the next night for only $99.00. Unfortunately, I had already booked another non-refundable room somewhere else, so this came a little too late, but we would have gone for it if we hadn't already made other arrangements. The only negatives I can think of: valet parking was pricey at $35 per night, but I'm guessing that's comparable to other hotels in the area. The bar on the 9th floor was a very nice atmosphere (incredible view) but I found the cocktail selection limited and very pricey (over $11 per drink). Again, though, perhaps that's comparable to other hotels in the area. The water in the shower didn't get very hot at 5:00 PM-- really only about lukewarm. I'm guessing that's because their hot water heaters are set on a timer to only heat at peak shower times. I appreciate the conservation aspects of that but dang, I really wanted that hot, pre-dinner shower since we'd been out walking around all afternoon. If you want to stay somewhere that feels a little more special than the run-of-the-mill hotel, but you don't want to pay Ritz prices, Hotel Indigo strikes a really happy medium. If I have the opportunity to visit the Gaslamp area of San Diego again, I will definitely stay be staying at Hotel Indigo.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cStaff Lied and Refused to Allow Guest to Check In\u201d", "Author": "jdhollinger", "ReviewID": "UR117564536", "Content": "I called ahead to request permission for a member of our party to check in before we arrived.

Free wi-fi! Hard to find in hotels these days... Now for a few minor problems... Cocktails and food were overpriced for what they were, even during happy hour. I would have spent a lot more time on the 9th floor bar if the prices were more reasonable. I saw a few people in the elevator taking cans of Coors light up to the bar, but I didn't know if that's allowed... $35 a night for parking! I know everyone complains about it but I'm still trying to let it sink in that I payed over $100 for 3 nights of parking. We saw a lot nearby that was $10 a night, but I didn't know how safe it was, and it seemed like kind of pain that we would have to walk 3 blocks every time to get our car. Luckily, valet staff was quick getting our car and they are very nice. Noisy. Walls have to be super thin or something. I did not sleep well at all the entire time I was there, despite the extremely comfy bed. I heard doors slamming, babies crying, construction in the early AM, people talking. Room service hours. I was reading the information book in my hotel room and the book said they have 24 hour room service. We walked back from a bar a little after midnight and were hungry. We were thinking of trying to find a place to eat but I remembered reading that they have 24 hour room service so we decided to go back and order something.

The decor is attractive, with (apparently) wood floors, cool earthy colors, and modern bath furnishings and electronics. But a hotel room is first and foremost a place to sleep, and that's where this one fails to hit the mark. Noise, or rather, lack of adequate soundproofing between rooms appears to be the culprit. Every door closing, every conversation in the hallway was clearly audible (and I do mean clearly--we learned way too much about our floormates' personal lives). TVs in adjoining rooms were not as clearly audible, but the bass came thumping through. And those hardwood floors? It means any time some in the room above dropped something hard or walked across in a hard-soled shoe, we got to hear it. Street noise, even on a higher floor, was also quite strongly heard in the room. Second problem: the bed was a reasonably firm one, but as a king-size, it still had four small and unpleasantly foamy pillows, the kind I'd expect at a Holiday Inn Express, instead of the large, cushy pillows I'd expect at an upscale hotel. No extra blankets or pillows in the closet. The bathroom was attractive, but had no tub, just a walk-in shower, which I actually prefer but not all do. There were no washcloths when we checked in, and no floor mat the next day. Wet tile floors, whee! No robes provided, another common amenity for a true upscale hotel. The much-advertised views of Petco park are oversold. The park is two full blocks away from the hotel, so one is looking between other buildings into the park. It's more interesting than looking at more high-rises, but don't think you'll really be watching a game from your room, at least not without serious magnification. Lobby and bell staff were friendly when approached directly, but otherwise detached. Never a \"good evening\" or \"welcome back\", even when they weren't otherwise occupied. Someone in management is still thinking too down-scale. IHG needs to put some line staff from Intercontinental in place to touch up service. Even then, the main problems are structural.

In keeping with the nicely integrated Petco Park (home of the San Diego Padres) just a block away, Dieter and David and the rest of the front desk team have hit one out of the park. So many hotels these days have forgotten how important the initial reception is when you arrive, so it was refreshing to see that that was not the case here. And even better yet, that was only the beginning of an overall pleasant stay. The hotel amenities are well above what you would expect from this price point in downtown San Diego, the location is perfect for walking to the Gaslamp, Convention Center and the up & coming East Village area, and the Table 509 \"lounge\" off the lobby has a surprisingly nicely stocked bar where Matt and Crystal have the same great attitudes we received from the reception desk (be sure to visit the 9th floor lounge - the view alone is worth it).

A little patch of grass for dogs is on the 9th floor, but my dog will not use it.

AAA and other types of discounts help out. They have little packages too like prepaid parking. Follow them on twitter for special rates - I've gotten rates as low as $99.

The restaurant in the hotel has sparse, relatively expensive menus. That really isn't much of a problem given the abundance of restaurants within easy walking distance. We particularly valued The Broken Yolk for breakfast, at which you can also receive a 10% discount if you show your Hotel Indigo key.

They are 100% pet friendly and my dog was very comfortable staying here. Dogs are allowed in EVERY part of the hotel including the bar and restaurant area. I booked a King City View Room and requested a high floor for $135.00 a night. Upon arrival the valet was exceptionally friendly, they were very professional and really went above and beyond my expectations. Upon check in i was greeted by a front desk employee.. don't remember his name, i think it was Deider, anyway he was VERY UNPLEASANT. He didn't say hello, didn't give me any information about the hotel, or anything in the surrounding area, didn't tell me that there would be a $75.00 AUTHORIZATION HOLD on my credit card for incidentals , and he didn't really seem to throw a smile or be happy to have a job, or even be alive for that matter. He was kind of rude and just bitter as he handed me my hotel keys and credit card back. (Seriously if you hate your job that much and are in a bad mood, there are plenty of other people who are up beat and have a personality who can do his job 100 times better) anyway, we checked in and to my surprise was on the 11th floor. I thought the hotel only had 9 levels so this was a surprise (they have 12). The room was exceptional, very spacious, very clean, very modern, and overall A+. As part of bringing a dog to the hotel they offer a ruff life package according to their website where a dog bowl, and dog bed are provided. This was not so I called the front desk and got the same jerk who checked me in and he never followed up with me, it took an hour to get a dog bowl. Anyway on a positive note - EVERYTHING about this hotel is great, all the staff was very nice and friendly (other than the first guy). Housekeeping was a bit on the poor side, it took 1/2 hour to get towels, 1/2 hour to get anything and I had to request maid service. I mentioned this to the front desk upon checkout and to my surprise for the inconvenience they credited me $35.00 (one day) toward the valet parking. I recommend the Valet, it is $35.00 per night but totally worth it, yes there are other lots on the street for $10-$15 less, but they go unmanned at night and anything can happen. This hotel is literally within walking distance to 5th Avenue and Market St. which all the nightlife is on, there are a ton of bars, restaurants, hookah lounges, cigar lounges, coffee shops and so much culture and is very exciting and ALIVE during the day and after 5pm. It is a very quick 10 minute drive to Ocean Beach (Dog Friendly Off Leash Beach), Sea World and other beaches in the area. The hotel is also one block away from PetCo field where the Padres play, and you can get a great view of the game from the Hotel's 9th Level Rooftop Bar for free. The area south to the hotel (East of 11th Avenue) known as \"the east village\" is kind of sketchy, but it looks as the neighborhood is upcoming. Overall, I'd stay here again, they took care of my problems and always greeted me when i returned back to the hotel with a smile and a hello...even at 2AM. Even the Valet remembered where i was going and asked me how was the beach, how was the bar etc. If you are looking for a good walking distance to all the nightlife and culture, this modern hotel is definitely the place. On my last night there, i was surprised to find in my room under my door an invitation to stay an extra night at $99.00. This is something I have never seen before anywhere else and if I had the extra time to spare i should would have taken them up on their offer as I could have used another day in San Diego. Excellent Customer Service other than the jerk who checked me in at the beginning. I am happy that my overall experience was redeemed by everyone else and his attitude at the beginning didn't leave me with a negative impression of hotel and it's service.

We stayed because my wife had earned free night through an ICH promotion that expired at the end of the month. The rooms themselves were nice. The terrace that overlooked Petco Park - divine (Padres were on the road during our stay). The workout room was great - and for the Californiat types, there was even a Meditation Terrace. I have ZERO issues with the accomodations. The staff? Pretty much every interaction was a negative one. It wasn't like they were rude - they just appeared to be undermotivated and rules bound. Issue #1 - Check in. My wife is a very frequent ICH guest, on her way to Platinum status this year. We also aren't partying youngsters, so we find that being on the \"Elite\" floors keeps the wilder partiers away. So we asked for elite floor and was told they didn't have one (which is hard to believe given the size). To make matters worse, they put us in a room where there was a door between the rooms - which vibrates sound from the room next door. And of course, the wild partiers ended up next door. We called security, but much sleep was lost. Issue #2 - The next morning we went to the front desk and asked about our neighbors - were they checking out, would they fill that room that night etc. All kinds of unclear answers. Finally we just asked to be moved (this was at 7:45am) but mentioned we had a critical place we needed to cab to by 8am. Could we leave our stuff in the room, and change rooms at 1pm? Nope. They made us pack up and get out right there. So of course we miss our 8am meeting time. Aren't hotels supposed to make things more convenient? For the record, the room they moved us to had no door to the adjoining room - an improvement. But another very, very loud floor with doors slamming all night long. Issue #3 - We were on the terrace Saturday with a great bottle of wine, enjoying the weather. The bartender saw us come on with both the wine and our glasses and said nothing to us. So we made plans to do the same on Sunday. We stepped out with a beer and were having a great conversation with some fellow Texans. Suddenly out of nowhere an employee appears and tells us all to leave - that outside beverages weren't allowed on the terrace. When I tell him that they were allowed yesterday, even blessed by the bartender, he said the bartender \"was new\" and didn't know what he was talking about. Huh?!?!? I later learned (see Issue #4) that \"new\" seems to be the term tossed around for all customer errors made at the Indigo. The sad part was that we would have stayed on the terrace and talked - but the guy was so abrupt - and of course, even in late afternoon, the terrace bar was not yet open. So we were pretty much forced to leave. Truly wished I have gotten that jerk's name. Issue #4 - Upon returning home I see a significant charge on my credit card. Despite staying on free nights, we were charged as if they had never seen the freecertificates. The Front Desk Manager, Darin (one guy who has excellent customer skills, btw) said he would issue a refund. We haven't seen it yet, so let's hope we don't need to escalate this. Again the reason for failure? The person checking us in \"was new\" and messed up. Bottom line: Great, great property. Nice location with places off the Gaslamp Quarter that are less touristy (don't miss The Mission for coffee and breakfast, The Neighborhood for lunch and beers). Hotel a bit noisy - and no matter how hard we tried (we'd be the ones waking YOU up at 6am) the doors shut very loud. Service needs a tuning up - asking to be in a quiet place, having a drink where you are allowed one day and denied the next, getting your bill right. We weren't asking for much. And sadly we got nothing but let down. I keep the rating at average because in the end it is a very nice property and location.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPersonalized attention in a remarkable setting.\u201d", "Author": "Lquirk13", "ReviewID": "UR110784787", "Content": "The Hotel Indigo exceeds the expectations of travel goers.

First off, I went to take a shower & the water temperature was basically luke warm. The water temp was rectified after one phone call to the front desk. We came back after a quick walk through the gaslamp quarter and found that the problem with our shower was fixed but now the toilet wouldn't flush, again with the phone call to the front desk & another maintenance visit. With all that said, everyone was extremely helpful and understanding about how frustrated we were & they did everything in their power to correct the problem. From then on we had a fantastic stay in a beautiful room with great staff. The happy hour on the rooftop bar was great and Adriana in hotel lobby bar was friendly and warm.

It's a bit further from the Harbor activities but not an impossible walk. The rooms are very nicely done --larger than most hotels at that price range--modern, restful decor both in the rooms and the lobby; clean. We were on the 6th floor but it was somewhat noisy down on the street at least until 2am but then you are in the middle of an entertainment area in a big city so to be expected. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from both Petco and it's on the edge of Gaslamp. The service throughout the hotel, with one exception, is excellent. Check in and out is great (special commendation to Darren the desk manager who was particularly nice, as was the other lady at the front desk when we left). My wife left her purse in the bar the night before we left, and we didn't notice it until the next morning. She called down and it was delivered to our room immediately. So the hotel in general is a very good value and very pleasant. The one exception on service and value is the breakfast restaurant (near the bar). First, there is very limited choice on eggs--scrambled, scrambled, or scrambled in various forms. No choice. Second . We came down for bkfst within the specified serving times on a Sunday morning. No one was there to seat us, so we just sat down at a table. There were 4 waiters and maybe 8 tables filled so it wasn't very busy or full. We waited 10 minutes for service and then it wasn't the waiter who came over to take our order but the great Darren who from the front desk noticed we had not gotten served and took it upon himself to come over and take our order. On the way out same thing happened--we asked for the check and waited. And waited. One waiter passed our table and indicated it was coming. It didn't. We don't know what the restaurant manager was doing at the bar but he wasn't getting our check. Finally 10 minutes after we asked for it, we looked over and even he had disappeared as had all the other waiters! So we just got up, left and told Darren at the front desk what we were doing and to just add any charges to our bill b/c we were tired of waiting. They did. And when I told the other lady at the desk on check out what happened, she very nicely did the right thing and as compensation took our bar bill from the last night off the final bill.

I was a little bit worried that because our window overlooked the valet parking stand and we were right over the bar that I'd hear noise, but once we closed the door, it was super quiet. I can only assume the walls have lots and lots of insulation. I was also expecting noise because of the (beautiful) hard wood floors, but not a peep (or thud or click) from the room above us. We went to a game at Petco and walked one block to get into the stadium. We didn't eat in the restaurant, so can't comment on food quality. Staff was super friendly. The ONLY downside was the $35 valet parking fee. I live in Los Angeles, so expect to pay something, but I thought it was a bit overpriced. If you're planning on going to a game, you probably want to factor in the convenience factor. Petco Park charges $15 - so for another $20, you can walk to the park in one block. And then walk back to your room in under 3 minutes and not have to worry about getting your car out of the Petco lot and get back to your room. Is it worth it? Depends on your frugality factor.

We rented a car for the last three days of the trip because we wanted to take a few day trips. I would suggest renting a car. I would suggest taking a trip to LA and Mission Beach. The hotel is very trendy, we loved the decor. Each room has a Keurig Coffee maker which was great! The staff was very friendly and very helpful! The hotel was very clean. There are plenty of restaurant's around the hotel and I would suggest a cafe called The Mission. The food is wonderful and at an affordable price. The portions are large so you may want to share.

At first, when looking on the map and seeing where the hotel was located compared to the hotels that were closer to the convention center, I was worried it would be too far away. Now, after the stay is complete, I consider myself lucky!! First, this hotel is bright and cheery. The staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome and ensure you have everything you need to make your stay enjoyable. Same goes for the bar/restaurant, Table 509. The bartenders/servers Adriana, William, Ish- all fo them- make you feel welcome, take the time to listen to what you like and make the best drink recommendations based on what you offer up. Love that! Now, to compare this hotel to say, Hard Rock, near the convention center is almost unfair! It's literally like night and day. Also, any hotel near the convention center deals with the trolley and train ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT! I can't tell you how many of my colleagues had sleepless nights because of that alone! Other great things to note about Hotel Indigo are that it's pet-friendly (although I only saw dogs), they have great specials throughout the week, and the stadium (Petco Park) is just a block away! They do offer valet parking for $35 a day but there is street parking available some times, too, just beware you're on the right side due to street cleaning! (San Diego is so clean!) All in all- a wonderful spot. I was on the 10th floor- the room was spacious and cheery! The beds are super comfy (four pillows to each bed and they are soooo soft and fluffy!)

I was in charge of picking the hotel for my friend's bachelorette party, and this was a gem. The hotel itself is clean, bright, and cool/trendy, but not so much so that you feel uncomfortable. We came downtown during a padres game and had no trouble getting our cars parked with their valet. The rooms were fantastic. We were on the 8th floor with a good view of the ballpark (about half the field). The room was so quiet with the window shut, and even though they allow pets, we only heard a dog barking once (and not at night). When we booked the rooms and called the restaurant for brunch reservations the staff was really friendly and asked if the booking was for a special occasion. When we arrived, the manager had a festive champagne and OJ tray delivered to the bachelorette's room. She was so surprised, and so were we! It was an incredibly nice touch. The beds were sooooooo comfortable, like sleeping on a cloud. And even though the rooms are bright and cheerful, there are blackout curtains to get some much needed sleep after a girls night out. The location of the hotel is also a huge plus. We could walk to the restaurant and club that we visited that night. It was really convenient. We ate at the restaurant in the lobby for breakfast and really enjoyed the meal. The service was friendly and fast, and the food was nicely presented, which is surprising for a breakfast meal. Everything tasted great (I had the breakfast burrito, but i also tried my friend's monte cristo and another girl's croissant sandwich), and the prices were reasonable. To top it off, they automatically set us up with a late checkout for 2:00 PM. I guess they knew that a bachelorette party would need the extra time the next day :) I live in San Diego and would definitely stay here again even for a little stay-cation.

I don't even know where to start. On our arrival there, we were promptly greeted by the valet and shown to the front desk. This is where we met David Ornelas. He was absolutely key in making our stay here at the Hotel Indigo a wonderful one. We were able to get an upgrade on our room since we mentioned it was our first year anniversary and we had a wonderful surprise of a complimentary bottle of wine to celebrate upon our return to the room later that night! When first walking into our room, we were totally taken aback by the beauty of it. It was simultaneously modern and inviting. The hardwood floors were beautiful and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've had the pleasure of sleeping in. The TV was HUGE, which was a big plus for my husband and I loved the oversized chair and ottoman in the corner. The bathroom was immaculate. We loved the shower and size and the large amount of counter space for all your stuff!! We checked in on Friday, but our anniversary was on Saturday. After a full day of shopping and checking out Balboa Park, we returned to the hotel to see what kind of restaurant recommendations the front desk could offer us. Fortunately, David was working again and him and another helpful person recommended many restaurants which catered our every need (seafood, on 5th, patio seating). We decided on Asti for a nice italian dinner and David was able to make us reservations for that night. The dinner was amazing and our server had a little tip off that it was our anniversary. After dinner, we headed up for a relaxing nightcap at the rooftop bar for wonderful views of the city and great conversation. We are thoroughly pleased with our stay at the Hotel Indigo.

The location is excellent; the hotel is new and everything was clean; and the staff, from Front Office management to housekeeping, are the epitome of customer service and hospitality. I coordinated an event in San Diego, with attendees arriving from all over the country. From the day we arrived, the staff showed nothing but excellent service. Here are some employees that absolutely stand out in my mind as having gone above and beyond for me and my colleagues: - David (the shorter one), at the front desk, did an excellent job of taking care of all the attendees during check-in. He ensured that they were all checked-in in a timely manner and provided them information that was pertinent to our event. - Adriana (Bar Manager) ensured that her staff was well aware of our group's reception/ice-breaker and always checked in with me to make sure everything was going well. Michelle was the bartender that took great care of us on the 9th Floor Lounge; and William was the primary bartender in the afternoons, at the main bar downstairs, who took care of group orders for those who chose to partake in a beverage after our meetings. These two were not only great employees but had a great personalities. Remember the names of members of my group was a true sign of how much they enjoy their work and the guests. - Derick (Director of Food and Beverage) worked with me in arranging a procedure where the transition between meeting to lunch was seamless, by taking advanced orders and ensuring that the wait for food orders was minimized. - Michael did an excellent job in attending members that ordered their breakfast from the restaurant and also did an excellent job in assisting Derick in getting lunch out in a timely manner. - Adrian, from Banquets, made contact with me on the first day we were going to use the meeting rooms and was very attentive in our needs for our AM and PM service and AV needs. Matt assisted him in getting the room set up and ensured everything was always stocked. - And last but not least, there is Kelsey, Sales Manager. Kelsey worked with me for over 2 months in ensuring our meeting was a great success. Not only did she endure several emails and phone calls from me, but was also asked to work with my California reps in coordinating the reception/ice-breaker. Kelsey was the key figure in the hotel. Not only did she ensure that all of the employees I mentioned, were made aware of our group, but also other employees within the hotel. Throughout the time we were there, my group members were coming up to me to tell me of their positive experience with all members of the hotel staff, and how throughout the stay everyone in the group felt like they were treated as VIPs. Due to my job, I've stayed in hotels ranging from no-star to 5-star and without a doubt, this hotel made me feel more of a valued guests than any other. The attentiveness, personalities and care felt genuine and sincere. Whereas other hotels felt more like it was just \"part of the job\" to be nice. This is the epitome of what the hospitality industry should be. I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning on visiting San Diego, and I know that I will be staying here again in the future, regardless of whether it's for business or pleasure.

My husband and I arrived at the hotel after staying in the Los Angeles area for a couple of days. We had eaten at a restaurant the night before and I wasn't feeling well at all. I had taken ill almost over night. We suspected it was food poisoning but couldn't be sure without seeing a physician. My husband took care of me as best as he could. While visiting the restaurant of the hotel, he met a young man named William who worked there. He told this young man that I was sick and needed some crackers if they had any. William told him to return to the room, and that he would take care of everything. Soon enough, he arrived with crackers and a beverage he insisted would help my stomach feel better. I not only started to feel better that night, but the liquid helped. William continued to call and check in on me in the coming days and when my husband came down with the same thing during our stay he helped with anything he could do for him too.

At first we were dealing with the hotel Sales Manager Derick; however mid-negotiations Curtis Crawford the head chef ended up as our contact-go to guy. The moment Curtis took over; from planning the menu to our venue requirements he was professional and very helpful. I have to say it was the easiest meeting/event I have ever planned with everything running smoothly. Curtis made sure that prior to our event all of our questions were answered and any issues taken care of (He even offered the restaurant Phi as a backup contingency plan, had the weather turned too cold for an outside event). The day of the event we arrived greeted by the valet guys to help us unload our car and take everything to our meeting location. I must say the valet guys are the \"Silent Saviors\" willing to help out in any way with running back and forth from the car to the event space making sure we had everything we needed without letting us lift a finger and all with a smile and expecting nothing in return. I didn't get his name but Kudos to the valet guy who helped us all night; someone needs to give him a raise! Everything else from that point on ran smoothly, from setting up the space on-time to having the microphone arrive just in time for the awards ceremony....Curtis made sure to check on the event throughout the night until the very end. The food was excellent; we opted to do heavy appetizer stations instead of a full plated menu; but I can only imagine what the full menu would be like if the appetizers were fantastic! The event staffs were friendly and helpful; must say whoever is the hotel manager must be doing a good job because it showed throughout the hotel and the staff's demeanor, not one bad apple in the bunch! So, do yourself a favor and if you are debating on booking an event at the hotel...don't debate, book it; you will not regret your decision and everyone will thank you for a wonderful event you planned!

I stayed at the Hotel Indigo in the Gaslamp Quarter at the beginning of November 2010 for 6 nights. My wife was at a conference at the Convention Center and I decided to work out of the hotel room. I had read reviews on TripAdvisor that mentioned others being able to check in earlier than the 3 pm check-in time and thought I'd ask beforehand. I called the night before and was told that not all rooms were booked and might be able to check in early the next morning since my wife's conference started at 9 am. After I dropped off my wife and gave the hotel a call. Kimberly told me that they were all booked and to call back at noon to see if any rooms were available then. I called back at 12:30 pm and Kimberly told me that they were still all booked and the room I had requested was still occupied and the person had requested a late check out. I found it hard to believe that no other rooms were available, but I thought \"sure, I get it, technically the check-in time is 3 pm and hopefully they will extend the same courtesy to me when I request a late check out on our last day.\" When I finally was able to check in at 4 pm, I was told by the valet guy that the bell hop was not available and I could wait, but I decided to check in regardless because I had such a long day already. Carrying more bags and equipment than I could handle, no one at the front desk even offered to help me after handing me the keys to the room. The next day, I realized that I needed to vacate the room for a couple of hours so that housekeeping could clean the room and decided on an extended lunch from 12-2 pm. When I came back, the room had still not been cleaned, but I needed to get work done, so I realized we just had to go without a clean room for a night. The next day, I left at 11 am and told the front desk of the situation and they said the room would be cleaned by the time I got back. At 3 pm, I went back to my room and the \"cleaning service requested\" sign was still on my door handle, I went to the front desk and complained about how it had been 4 hours and no one had cleaned the room. They apologized and said that I was next on the list, so I went to the lounge for about 30 minutes. When I returned, the room had finally been cleaned and I thought this would be over with. The next day, the same thing happened... over the course of our stay, our room had only been cleaned 3 times. The front desk didn't even communicate our request to the cleaning staff. Fast forward to the last day. I was told by Peyton at the front desk that 11 am was the check-out time, so I requested an extension given that one had been granted to whoever stayed in our room previously and that resulted in me checking in after 3 pm on the first day. Peyton said \"maybe we can give you to 11:30 or noon at the latest because we are expecting a full house.\" Nice, I thought. Now, I'm a reasonable person, I realize there are official times for check-in and check-out - I get it. However, for there to be very little flex is ridiculous... if I can wait until 3 pm for check in, why can't someone else and why can't the front desk just go the extra mile and say: \"Listen, we have a full house, but here's what I can do. I will give you until 1 or 2 pm... just make sure you let me know when you're going to check out so I can get the cleaning staff into the room as soon as possible. How does that sound?\" Now, that would be service... unfortunately, you won't find that at the Hotel Indigo in San Diego. Regarding their room service: my wife ordered $40 worth of dinner (which she said was terrible quality, btw - I had read about this in previous reviews). She was astounded at the bad service she got. We didn't have any menus in our room, so she asked the room service people to give her some options, to which they responded \"Um, it's really hard to tell you what we have if you don't have a menu.\" She thought, why is it my fault there's no menu in my room? And then when they finally arrived, they asked, \"where do you want me to put this\" and just dropped the tray on the bed. Nice. Finally, the Valet: after leaving the car in the garage for 3 days, I was surprised to find a distinct sewer smell in my car. The valet guys had told me that the hotel had been working on the smell, but even after a night of driving and airing out the car, the smell lingered. The same thing happened the next day and I finally realized that I should close the vents in the car, which helped. But after complaining to the Valet, they said they would let their manager know and that I should also speak to the front desk, who immediately blamed the Valet guys. Again, no help from the front desk. Anyway, one of the Valet guys told their manager and he spoke with the GM who eventually compensated all of my parking charges, which was a nice gesture. Another note, even though Valet parking is expensive at $32/day, I knew that going into the situation and I realized that it was worth it for the security and convenience. Plus, the Valet guys were very nice and I think they even felt bad about how much they were charging, so they were extra friendly. Anyway, I thought if the front desk was half as friendly and helpful as the Valet guys, I would have had a much more pleasant experience. Bottom line: The front desk (Kimberly and Peyton) were not very helpful... I got pat answers and nothing remotely resembling actual troubleshooting and service. Actually, there were 2 people that stood out from the rest: Bruce and Dieter... they actually were helpful and at least provided other alternatives for my needs. The Valet was expensive, but they know it and provide great service. I was disappointed because I had heard that the service was very friendly, but I didn't find that to be the case... at most times, it seemed unprofessional, run by young trainees, and not helpful at all.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Quebec City, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBig rooms at this boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mailmanwill", "ReviewID": "UR85764803", "Content": "Prompt check in and very friendly staff at the Indigo.

It was a surprise, so I did a lot of research about areas and hotels, and finally settled on Hotel Indigo. It was absolutely fantastic, and I can't recommend it highly enough. We brought our dog with us, which I really hesitated over because although hotels may say that they are \"dog-friendly\", often they are just \"dog-tolerant\". There are usually all sorts of rules and regulations, and fees, and it's just a bit stressful. Hotel Indigo is really different - they genuinely welcome dogs. No fees, no restrictions, and they actually looked happy to see our dog at check in! There is a little park a block away right in front of Petco Park where dogs run off leash. Also, the hotel obviously goes to great pains to ensure that the hotel does not feel doggy - it is immaculate, and very stylish. For once, our dog actually enjoyed her weekend away too. The area is brilliant and the hotel could not be more convenient for the many bars and restaurants. Lastly, the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful -probably the best service we have had at a hotel for a while.

Many others have praised its virtues as a modern boutique hotel, so I will focus on a few other things. The location is pretty good, just far enough from the busy areas of the Gas Lamp to afford a quieter experience but also great for walking into the heart of it all. The not so good: For a 4 Star hotel (purported) the quality of some of the basics was rather poor. Bathroom towels for example were cheap barely above Motel 6 standards for thin and scratchy. Not to nit pick, but for a hotel like this with so much style this just stood out as really bad. One of our rooms actually had a card and gift for another guest. We let the front dest know, and they sent someone up to get the items. This shows lack of care from the front desk staff in assigning rooms. I would be careful of making special requests or booking for someone with the intent of providing additional personal attention. My room had two problems. One, in the middle of the night the bathroom fan would make strange noises when off. A sporadic clicking sound. The bathroom door was not seated correctly on it's tight hinges and caused the door to scream very loudly when open or closed. Very disrupting and could actually be heard in the next room. This may be minor, and probably corrected by a phone call if it was noticed in the middle of the night. Room-service was poor at best. I ordered breakfast and it arrived promptly, but cold bland, and completely lacking in attention to match that of the hotel. Other small things show a lack of attention to detail. It seems like so much time at that hotel was spent on the design and creating this \"atmosphere\" that they forgot to first be a hotel.

According to the front desk clerk, Dieter, he saw her get off the elevator and run towards the lobby doors. She ran through them and down the street crossing two major throughfares to PETCO stadium park. The Dieter ran after her. He finally caught up with her in a Seven-Eleven convenience store and brought her back to the hotel. He locked her up in a sales office however she managed to open THAT door a couple of times before I arrived. Needless to say, I was amazed and astonished that: 1. She opened the door to my room. Now anyone that knows Angel knows that she can open my doors at home. However, didn't THINK that she could manage a commercial hotel room door! 2. She got into the elevator and was able to make it downstairs. The front desk clerks watched the security video tape and said that she went straight to the elevator banks and waited until the doors opened. The big question is: HOW DID SHE HIT THE DOWN BUTTON??? 3. Angel and I had just gone to Petco Stadium that morning for a walk and had stopped in the 7-11 store to get a drink. Guess she thought I was still there! 4. Last but certainly not least, she managed NOT to get run over in busy San Diego traffic! She has become quite the sensation around here at Hotel Indigo... I'm just hoping to get her back to Colorado in one piece. And now a BIG plug for this hotel: everyone here has bent over backwards for me and Angel... they love dogs here and completely cater to them.

From the moment we arrived and were greeted by valet staff, to the time of check-out with the front desk team we were not only treated as respectable hotel guest, but staff was also committed to exceeding our expectations. Whenever we had special/specific request (i.e. last minute cancellations, early arrivals, extended stays, billing request, priority club points discrepancies, etc.), the staff went above and beyond to ensure that our demands were met.

It was noisy, though, there was sound leakage coming from unknown places, and they have to remedy this somehow. The location is perfect, walking distance to the main drag, on a pleasant , very energetic part of town. What sets them apart, however, was their honesty and integrity. I had left an expensive watch on the bed upon checkout and discovered it was missing half a day later. They were too busy to check up on housekeeing the entire afternoon, but at night, one of the guys called me up to say they had located it and that I can pick it up anytime. I have to say, in my mind, I was ready to let the watch go, hoping it will benefit someone's useful life (sarcastically speaking), but was delightfully surprised to have found that housekeeping acted responsibly and did the right thing.

Upon arriving, the curb service was great with our bags and our dog. Among all the great Bell serviceman, Sergio was the most notable. He greeted our dog daily with the affection only dog lovers provide.
