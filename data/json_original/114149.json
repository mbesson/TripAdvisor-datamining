My family and I stayed at the Lagham around the same time and I can absolutely verify that the pool chlorine levels were ridiculous. Our daughter's hair was exactly the same as she reported - a tangled brittle mess. After gobs of conditioner not working, we ended up chopping off 5 inches. We still ended up having to buy some chlorine-removing shampoo. My son's bathing suits also lost their color. When I called the Langham to complain, action had already been taken (thanks to the other reviewer, as I now find out). I luckily did not have the same experience with management. I'm sure they had no other choice other than to be responsive since the health department was involved. I felt compelled to write to support the other reviewer. I will say that besides this experience, the rest of the stay was great. The concierge, in particular, was extremely helpful and the room was impeccable, even though a bit old. I am often accused of being too forgiving, but as long as the Langham has rectified the pool, I would still recommend staying there. The poor customer service the other reviewer experienced, however, is unacceptable, so can understand someone hesitating.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cpretty nice place\u201d", "Author": "nycnyc12", "ReviewID": "UR126349957", "Content": "not over the top but clean and cheerful and gracious. good location for walking to quincy market. bell staff excedingly friendly.

And since we went to the Langham primarily for the pool, if I had read about this, I would have definitely stayed somewhere else. Even though we have never had a problem at any other pool\u2014including the indoor water parks where you can barely breathe through the chlorine fumes\u2014one of my daughters had such extreme skin irritation from the pool water that she later sobbed in the shower from the pain. Both of my daughters\u2019 hair completely changed consistency into a dry and brittle mess. My husband\u2019s swimsuit bleached in the pool water. And when I called to alert the hotel of the severity of the situation so they could protect other guests, I first got complete unresponsiveness and then a flat denial that there was any problem. Other than watching my children suffer because of my unfounded confidence that a five star hotel would have completely safe pool conditions, my ultimate conversation with the hotel manager was the worst part. He was completely dismissive and condescendingly \u201cassured\u201d me nothing was wrong with the pool, but he also refused to give me the chemical levels during our stay. (Although the spa manager did tell me that the pH was \u201con the high side\u201d at 8.0, which is coincidentally the upper legal limit and the CDC says healthy pool water should be between 7.2 and 7.8.) I could not believe the general manager\u2019s failure to accept there was an issue he needed to resolve and told him he left me no choice but to report the situation to the city authorities. Several days later, the Boston pool inspector called me to report on their inspection. He told me that there had been a mechanical failure and that the chlorine levels were \u201coff the charts,\u201d so the city suspended the Langham\u2019s pool permit and closed the pool until the issue was resolved. Truly unbelievable. The pool was kept open for at least four days at illegal levels, and for two days after I had reported the \u201cchemical burns\u201d in my child (and yes, that was the exact terminology I used). Either the Langham\u2019s pool maintenance system left them incapable of knowing they were operating at illegal levels, or they lied to me and kept the pool open despite knowing how high the levels were\u2014either way the situation is completely unacceptable and unsafe. And even if their testing protocol was flawed, they should have done more to protect their other guests after I reported the chemical burns from the pool. Both managers told me they received no other complaints, but my initial complaint at the front desk was not given to them. If you\u2019ve had a similar problem, please leave a review so other people will know whether this was an isolated incident. Finally, I reported the entire incident in a lengthy email to the corporate offices of the Langham chain and was not even given the courtesy of a response. I am truly stunned at the complete failure at every level of Langham management. Good luck choosing a hotel. Needless to say, we won\u2019t be going back to the Langham. Next time we want a Boston hotel with a pool, we\u2019ll try the Marriott Long Wharf, the Copley Weston, or the Boston Harbor Hotel. If you want the full story, here it is . . . . My husband, two children, and I stayed at the Langham on February 20 and 21. Our goal was to spend the night in a fancy hotel in Boston with a great pool. The room was beautiful and the service was great, with special touches like very early check-in and complimentary chocolates sent to the room for my daughter\u2019s birthday. The pool was also beautiful, as nice as it looks in the pictures. After just one swim, though, my daughters\u2019 hair completely changed consistency. It was with no exaggeration like straw and could not be brushed until it was washed and conditioned, and then it was still completely dry, brittle, and stiff. (Can you imagine if a to-be bride at the hotel had gone in the pool!) My husband\u2019s swimsuit was also ruined, being bleached from blue to spotty gray. Still, we were there for the pool and I trusted that in such a nice hotel, everything was safe. So, they went in the pool two more times, but the swims were short for my kids (who usually have to be dragged out of the pool) because the water was too irritating. After the third swim, one of them had a red rash around the goggle area on her face, so we left the pool. Because the stay was otherwise so nice, I just wanted to make the most of it and not complain. But when we left, I did mention at checkout that the pool caused these problems so they would be aware of the issue. Then we went home and the kids showered again to try to get their hair to a manageable condition. In the shower, I could see the extent of my younger daughter\u2019s rash and the water hurt her so much she was sobbing. As much as I wanted to let the whole thing go after a tiring stay away, I decided I had to call to alert them to the severity of the issue so they could do something to protect other swimmers. I assumed that I\u2019d be thanked for letting them know and told that they would get right on it to make sure no one else had that reaction, but that is not the response I got. I called at 4:45 pm and asked to speak to the manager. I was told there are many managers and asked what my issue was\u2014so I told this person that my child received a CHEMICAL BURN from the pool. Then I was told I should talk to the spa manager, who may have left for the day. The person on the phone told me she would have the spa manager call me back or she would call me herself. I waited an hour, knowing other people were in the pool, and I got no call back! I was flabbergasted at the lack of response! I really wanted to make sure the right people knew about the issue so they could correct it without anyone else suffering, so I called again and got the same person on the phone who told me the spa manager had left. In desperation and frustration, I again expressed that this was a safety issue\u2014A CHEMICAL BURN IN A CHILD. So I was asked if I wanted to be transferred to the spa. I couldn\u2019t believe it was on me to continue to communicate this issue, but what else could I do? I was transferred and there was no answer, so I left a very frustrated message. Then, a security person called me back, and he was responsive, but I still got the feeling that no one was checking that the pool was safe and getting people out of there if necessary. The spa manager called me later that night and assured me that the levels were safe. Before this, I was just trying to be a good citizen and let them know they had a problem, but once they started trying to minimize the situation, I became angry. While a place like this should have the pool water at ideal levels at all times, I know pool chemistry is variable (we have a pool). Things can get out of whack. But to insist that levels are normal when people have that kind of reaction to the water led me to the conclusion that either: 1) there is something wrong with the pool testing protocol and the Langham is incapable of knowing if the levels are safe, or 2) they knew levels were off and did not address it promptly and were not admitting it to me. Neither conclusion leaves me feeling comfortable. The next morning, the spa manager called me again to say she was investigating and to tell me that the levels had been acceptable, although she did tell me that the pH was \u201con the high side\u201d at 8.0. So, I looked that up\u20148.0 is the highest allowable level for public pools in Massachusetts (and for summer camp pools the highest allowable level is 7.8). OK, now we were getting somewhere. Also, at high pH levels, the chlorine is less effective, so they have to add more. I was not given a chlorine level, but it was likely high too given the legal requirements based on the pH level. According to the websites I checked, the combination of high pH and high chlorine is particularly irritating to the skin. During this morning call, the spa manager told me she had spoken to the general manager who said he would call me. He did not call until that night, and his call was the worst experience of the whole ordeal. He apologized for our situation but very condescendingly \u201cassured\u201d me that the pool levels were normal. Truly, I lost it with that denial. Things happen. Pool chemicals get out of whack. But to not own responsibility for the issue and pledge to immediately address it for the benefit of the other guests is unacceptable. I told him that I was very concerned that this would happen to someone else if they did not accept that there was a serious issue and he angrily and pompously insisted that they had always had everything under control. In anger and frustration, I asked him if I needed to get a lawyer to get him to understand the seriousness of the situation and he challenged me to do it. At that point, I knew the conversation was useless and just asked for the complete records of the chemical levels during our stay. He told me he would only give them to my lawyer! If there\u2019s nothing wrong with the levels, why not give them to me? So, the next morning, I called the City of Boston pool inspectors to report the problem. Oh, and five days after that first swim, my other daughter came down with swimmers ear, something she has never had before. This is the only time she has been swimming all winter. Swimmers ear is very rare in the winter and is a sign of poor pool conditions. But it gets even more insane! The Monday after our visit, I got from the pool inspector. We stayed at the Langham on Monday and Tuesday. Tuesday night is when I called to alert the hotel of the chemical burn. Tuesday night and Wednesday morning is when I was assured by the spa manager that the levels were safe. Wednesday night is when the general manager refused to admit there was a problem and give me the pool levels. Thursday morning I reported the problem to the Boston pool inspectors, who I believe went out that day. They found that there had been a \u201cmechanical failure\u201d in the pool system and that the chlorine levels were \u201coff the charts\u201d and \u201csuspended the permit\u201d for the pool until the issue was resolved. So, despite all of the denials, this pool was operating at illegal chlorine levels for at least four days! I wish I reported it to the city right away, but honestly, I felt like things would be resolved more quickly and safely if I went straight to the hotel. But instead, they stuck their head in the sand and ignored the problem until the city forced them to address it\u2014and unsurprisingly, I have received no apology from them. After I heard from the Boston authorities, I emailed the Langham chain to report the situation. It has been more than two weeks, and I have still not even received a response form them.

It is also fairly close to the Freedom Trail. We found it to be in a convenient location. Having read the trip advisor comments recommending rooms overlooking post office square and getting a room higher up, I decided to phone the hotel a week before to find out if it was possible to get such a room. Upon arrival, we were told that we had been given a room on the 7th floor overlooking post office square. It was also away from the elevator so we were really pleased that our request had been met. Haruko on the front desk deserves a mention as we found her to be welcoming and professional upon checking in to the hotel. We had a classic queen room and found it to be clean and a good size. The bed turn down service is a nice touch and you get a chocolate put on the pillow every evening. There is even a complimentary newspaper service in which you can get a copy of the Boston Globe. As our room was near the end of the corridor and being on the 7th floor, we found it to be quiet and peaceful. I thoroughly recommend this hotel. Tip - If you are coming to Boston for sightseeing, I would recommend getting the CityPass which costs $46 and is excellent value for money, but you would need to give yourself at least 2-3 days to see all the attractions. The New England Aquarium (excellent) is the nearest to the Langham Hotel and is in easy walking distance. For the remaining attractions which include the Prudential Tower skywalk, you will need to use the T to get to them. A weekly Charlie ticket costs $15 which is amazing value for money and gives you unlimited travel on the T and buses. The nearest T stops to the Langham are Downtown Crossing and State St, both of which are a 5-10 min walk away.

It was right at the elevators which was noisy especially in the evening and early morning. The room was clean, with a large flat-screen TV with amble stations, mini-bar, large closet and queen bed. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were very compressible and uncomfortable. Nightly turn-down service with chocolates, robes and slippers was a nice touch as were the nice toiletries from the hotel spa. Unfortunately, there was a very strong perfume smell in the bathroom and room which caused headaches and allergies. The wireless internet ($12/day) was very slow and inconsistent making it difficult to use. The hotel has a restaurant and a nice gym, indoor pool and spa.

We took Taxis to and from the airport which were only 15 minutes each way and cost less than $20. I have to say the service we received at the Langham was as good as anywhere we have been in the world. We booked the basic room and it was small but serviceable. However during our first night we had a problem with the room and the speed with which the problem was addressed together with the actions that the hotel took to rectify the problem were awesome. We were upgraded, offered Wi-Fi and breakfast!!. The Superior room which was on the 7th floor was ample size, quiet and serviced efficiently everyday by the housemaids. Our one concern were a number of comments concerning how quiet the area was at weekends being in the Financial District. We needn't have worried. We were within a 5 minute walk to Quinicey Market, The Old Statehouse and the Freedom Trail and the Seafront where the Trolley Buses (very worthwhile and great value) depart from. In the area we ate at Ruth's Chris steakhouse (excellent) and Mr Dooleys Irish Bar (great pub, fantastic atmosphere with good hearty pub grub) both of which were only a couple of minutes walk away. Taxi's were readily available outside the hotel and the rides to Legal Seafood Harbourside (Floor 2)and Atlantic Fish (no 2 rated Restaurant on TA) on Boylston Street were both under $10. Within the hotel we loved the Bond Bar for a stylish start and end to the evening - truly a great location. Overall we had a fantastic time in Boston and are so glad we chose the Langham.

Very good standard. I guess the best with this hotel is the swimmingpool area and the feeling of being in another time. I was very impressed by the doorman who looked so magnificent. The swimmingpool area is beautiful, very clean with a lot of light from the outside and it was not crowded at all on a saturday morning at 10.00 am! There is also a jacuzzi ... The area close to the hotel is very nice and it is by walking distance to several interesting sites as the Holocaust Memorial that I really liked a lot. It's an outside memorial so you do not need to pay anything or to check the opening hours because it's in a public park. I heard the site is also interesting by night. The Boston Common is not very far from the hotel and definately a must. It's like Boston's Central Park I guess with squirrels everywhere. We tried the breakfast once and it was good but not great. The closest subway station is a little bit far away when the wind is blowing during winter time but certainly not a problem in summer time. There is only one thing that I didn't really like and that was that the housekeeping staff did move our things. My first thought was that this was impressive because, when we came back from dinner, somebody had moved the things we had left on the bed somewhere else in the room (on a table I think) and we could just go to bed without thinking about tidying up. But the next day, that happened again, and I think that somebody threw away something that could look like an empty plastic bag but it wasn't totally empty and I wanted to keep the bill that was in the bag and the bag too!

I was checking in after 5:00 p.m. and leaving early the next morning. I'm assuming that it was because I booked at a discount, but I was given a room *directly* outside the elevator doors. And by discount, I mean a discount of their rates, still not cheap by any stretch. At 5:30 p.m. I could hear every conversation in the hallway. After attending a concert and returning to my room around midnight, and having to work the next morning, I was quite disturbed to hear children yelling in the hallway at 12:30 a.m. at the elevators, along with their parents' loud talking as well. To top it off, I had called just before checking in and was advised that the valet overnight parking fee was $40 and when I checked out, it suddenly was $42. Not that the $2 made a difference, but I had set aside cash to pay for the parking and to tip the valet, so I then had to charge the parking fee. I don't appreciate being nickled and dimed, especially after having just informed the front desk staff that I had been continually disturbed in my room. Seeing me holding the $40 cash for the parking should have been sufficient since I couldn't get my night of non-restful sleep back. It is in such a great place, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for its location and the fact that it does have a pool, but I would definitely ensure that you are not placed in a room by an elevator or you can expect to get no rest.

Our two negative observations about the Langham concern; the charge for wireless internet access in the bedrooms - $12.99 for 1 day access and $33.00 for 3 days & in the hotel lobby. For a hotel of this quality we think this unnecessary. The Langham was the only hotel during our stay in New England that charged us for wireless internet access and compared to other luxury hotel groups such as Raffles, Shangri-La and De Vere this puts Langham Hotels at a disadvantage certainly from our perspective as future guests. We were also surprised at the Norwegian sourced water in the bathroom costing $8.00 a bottle - European Visitors note you will receive complimentary bottled water each night at turn down when your slippers will also be placed by your bed. Our criticism is not only for the charge this but also for the source of water. Surely a 'responsible' hotel that seeks sustainable environmental credentials through guests not having their towels replaced each day etc. should be questioning the sustainability of importing water from Scandinavia in glass bottles? This is something the European traveller may be more conscious of than our American counterparts? This said we acknowledge our trip to the US was not green in itself! So in summary the Langham is a great city centre hotel despoiled by its 'extra' charges.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCentral Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Oldbloke_TH", "ReviewID": "UR119619765", "Content": "On our way home we stayed one night here.

Charging $4-8 dollars for \" small bites\" with drinks in the Bond bar ,when other high end hotels will give you small plate of nibbles with your drink, appears mean and the $42 per day valet charge is eye watering.I am aware they are a business and need to make a profit but if there is a perception in the customer's mind of profiteering rather than making a profit, they are getting it wrong.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ocean Grove, Victoria", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel for our first trip to Boston\u201d", "Author": "JulzieJ1", "ReviewID": "UR119095812", "Content": "We stayed for 3 days/nights at the Langham as part of our honeymoon.

This was our first visit to Boston, and we had been told Back Bay was the best area to stay in, however we wanted a nice hotel but didn't want to pay Back Bay prices so we chose the Langham. The location wasn't bad if, like us, you don't mind walking. You can easily walk to Quincy Market and the marina. The nearest T stop is about a 15 min walk which is doable but can get a bit tiring. Being the financial district we found a lot of places closed up really early so the area was a bit quiet. The one big negative about the Langham was that it does not offer free wireless internet, and it's about $20 a day to get it (kind of steep seeing as the rooms aren't cheap, and that it is full of business people).

One evening after the gift shop had closed, I called down to the front desk to ask where I'd be able to pick up a book or magazine in the area. The gentleman who I spoke with invited me to come down to the lobby so he could open the gift shop for me so I could find some reading material.

This hotel is handsome indeed, but has a more business-type feel to it than the likes of Back Bay Hotel or the Lenox. Location: - Well-located for business travellers due to its close proximity to pretty much every financial institution in Boston, a bit less attractive for Newbury St addicts. Although, keep in mind Boston is very walkable. If you shun the hotel restaurant for breakfast on weekend, you'll have a problem - there is a dearth of good options in that area. It is also not heavy on dinner choices (yes, Ruth's is close by), but you may walk to Chinatown for reasonable food (10-15mins). Room: - Superior King in our case. No surprises here for that category, although we wondered about the clunky CRT TV. No flatscreens in a 4-star hotel? It worked perfectly well, but it made me wonder the owner's willingness to cough up the capital expenditure to maintain such a huge outfit. They seem to have corrected it by now, still half a decade after most competitors. - On the more important issue of cleanliness, we could not fault it. - Size was generous, both for the living area and the bath. The most striking feature were the huge windows, which opened the view over Post Office square towards some of the imposing (for Boston..) skyscrapers, which made a memorable impression at night. Service - Check-in/out was efficient; retrieving our bags from the storage room took a while, but overall everything seemed professional. - Staff (both for room service and cleaning) was very friendly, which didn't do much to change the slightly impersonal feel of the place, however. Overall Impression - While there weren't any hiccups during our stay we came away unimpressed. Maybe the Langham appeals to the slightly \"mature\" traveller (we are in our early 30s); the atmosphere was more Old England than New England. Walking the corridors I thought it's a tad more stuffy than elegant or even luxurious, but of course that is a matter of personal taste. Objectively, it is a decent downtown option, not fancy but solid. It is just that you'll likely find better for pretty much the same price.

In checking in, however, the rates listed on my registration documents were $20 to $30 higher than specified in my email confirmation sent several weeks earlier. I had to produce that document before they would reduce the rate to what had been agreed. That was distressing. It was also disappointing that at an average nightly rate of nearly $300, the hotel still wanted to charge $15 a night for internet access. Fortunately, I didn't need it. I just used my smartphone instead. Having said all of that, the room was beautiful, though the upper hallways seemed dated.

It's a great brand with a great heritage, but its Boston property has a distinct problem: INFRASTRUCTURE. There is nothing that can be done about that, given the fact that the building was the old (in Boston, that means really old) Federal Reserve Bank building. So it has a massive girth, squat height, and wave upon wave of granite facade asking with all of its might that you stay away. The end result, once you do find a way in, is a forced imposition of elegance which, to my experience, did nothing to fight back the overall impression of claustrophobia. Not helpful is the window treatment I found in my room: a relatively small double hung window with an insulating pane screwed in to keep away any access to fresh air and a huge awning covering almost half of the visible exterior space, resulting in a bunker-like view. The location of the building in the continually deadening old center of finance in Boston leaves one with the simple impression that better hotels are to be found.

In addition to the usual bath amenities, there were two fluffy robes and two pairs of slippers, as well as a neat box of items often forgotten for nail care, shaving, etc. There is turndown service every evening, including a couple of chocolates. The concierge service should get special mention for outstanding service. The personable concierges were always helpful, whether it meant finding an address, giving directions, or locating a lost jacket. When we asked where to get a Charlie card (to ride the T), we were handed a card with fares on it! The pool is good - not huge, but big enough to swim laps, and set at a comfortable temperature. The ladders are a bit high, so getting in or out may be difficult for anyone with knee problems. But another plus - there are mats ringing the pool so that you will not slip! I haven't seen this elsewhere, but it certainly seems like something ALL pools should have. We'd definitely stay here again!", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFirst of all let me start by saying the...\u201d", "Author": "dana713", "ReviewID": "UR75274515", "Content": "First of all let me start by saying the actual hotel is beautiful.

While I was trying to voice my opinion, he was blatanly ignoring me and continued to go on with his nightly duties as if I was not there. I was talked down to as if I was a child.

We decided to look at the queen room, which was essentially an attic room under the roof eaves. Two people could barely walk around the bed, and we asked the front desk to find us a king room, as we had booked. Russell insisted that our reservation was for a queen room, and he would \"show us the confirmation on the computer\" to prove his point. That was his only concern: to show that the mistake was ours, and not his. He made no offer to find us a better room, reiterating several times that we had booked a queen room and that this queen room was all that was available. We told him we were willing to to see if a two-double bedded room was available, and our amiable bellman, Daniel, got the keys to another room on another floor, and took us there.

This was a valentines day getaway with the g/f. Trip was booked through hotwire so I didn't know what I was getting but the rate for a 4.5 star hotel was very good. Unfortunately The Langham is at best a 4 star and probably closer to a 3.5 star hotel even without any issues. Prior to arriving I called the concierge to order the \"rose petal turn down service\" I explained to the concierge that this was a surprise for my g/f and that we would be going to dinner at 8:30 so they could come anytime after that. Upon arrival the hotel is very unimpressive at first glance. I expect a very nice foyer for a 4.5 star hotel. The foyer to the Langham looks more like a Holiday Inn. Low ceilings and nothing eye catching whatsoever. Check=in moved briskly and the front desk was very courteous and did take the time to explain where the restaurants, fitness center and other services can be found. I thought this was a very nice touch. The room itself was average for Boston. I did get one of the worst rooms available, I guess that happens when you book through a discount site. The queen bed was fairly stiff but not horrible. The room itself was furnished in an older style. The furnishings were OK but nothing special and the TV was below average for even a 4 star hotel. The room amenities were quite nice, particularly the robe and toiletries. So far I would have been satisfied if this was a 3.5-4 star hotel, but this was clearly not a 4.5 star hotel. After settling in we decided to go to Bond for a pre-dinner drink and app. WOW is the first word that comes to mind when you see this place. It is a really spectacular lounge with the huge chandeliers, low slung seating and beautiful mirror back bar. Unfortunately this luxury comes with a price and that price is steep if you want one of their signature cocktails. We did enjoy the two martini's we had but I'm not sure they were worth $14. As for the apps, they were also pricey but they were worth every penny. We shared the fried calamari with thai chili sauce and lobster pot pie. Both were simply outstanding dishes. The Calamari were quite large, cooked perfectly and accompanied by a sauce that was the perfect blend of tangy, sweet and spicy. The Lobster pot pie was equally outstanding, large chunks of lobster were combined with potatoes and chantrelle mushrooms. After our $90 pre-dinner drinks and apps we headed up to the room to get ready for dinner. At 8:00 PM we got a knock at our door, luckily I answered the door and the g/f was busy getting ready so she didn't hear me ask the hotel staffer to come back after 8:30 for the turndown service. Had she answered the door the surprise would have been blown. After a wonderful dinner we head back to the room to put our leftovers in the fridge before going back to Bond for a night cap. It was around 10PM and I was a bit surprised that the rose petal turn down hadn't happened yet. Still being V-days weekend, I assumed they were busy and would get to us eventually. After a few more martini's we head up to the room a little after midnight, sadly still no roses. Guess the surprise is now on me. Things only got worse as I tried to sleep with what sounded like a train station running underneath our hotel room. I know other people complained about the sound but I really didn't think it would bother me. Again joke's on me, it was horrible and only the booze helped me fall asleep. Checkout the next morning went smooth and they did apologize twice for missing the turn down (though on V-day weekend, forgetting roses isn't really acceptable). Outside of Bond, nothing stands out at the Langham which makes it critically important that they nail all the little details. Unfortunately, for me at least, they failed miserably. Overall this is at best a 4 star hotel, if you go there expecting something akin to the Park Plaza Hotel (in a worse location) you should be satisfied.

This is a beautiful old property in a great Boston location. The hotel should be nicer simply because it could be. Let me say first that the hotel is clean and the rooms are adequate. I would stay here again. It bothers me when beautiful old hotels are not properly maintained. Wallpaper should not be peeling off. Tiles should not be missing. You get the idea. In my mind, this separates a great property from a merely adequate one. It also says something about the ownership and staff. It also makes an impression on people like me who spend lots of time in hotels. The front desk staff was great. They even called us 5 minutes after we reached the room to assure that it was satisfactory. A nice touch! They were also very helpful with walking directions. The room was very nice. Not the usual small closet-size room you expect in a city like Boston. I liked the fact that you could move around freely and had a comfortable place to sit. The bathroom was rather large and, to my delight, filled with extra towels and amenities. The bed was comfy and the linens were crisp and clean. That's all I ever expect. The TV was the old boxy type, but who goes to a hotel to watch TV? The window was small and the view was nothing to write home about, but again, unless you are planning to stay in the room and look out the window, who cares? The hallway noise and sounds of heavy doors slamming shut was a bit much a times. This is a regular problem in any old building. I wish they could cure it, because there's nothing worse than being jarred awake at 1:30 am by noisy hotel patrons having long conversations in doorways, following by slamming doors. The absolute worst thing was that the room was uncomfortably hot and the cooling system did nothing to help it. I wish that they would not shut the air conditioning completely off in the winter. This was an unsually warm November night, about 60 degrees, and it was over 75 in the room. Turning the cooling system on only made it worse, because no cool air was emitted. Unfortunately, things like this can ruin an otherwise satisfactory stay. It's Boston, so expect to pay dearly for parking. The valet dropped the ball on checkout. We called ahead as instructed but still had to wait outside the hotel for over 30 additional minutes for them to bring up our car.

The Langham fit the bill nicely. Valet parking and check-in were smooth, and the room was clean and fairly luxurious with bathrobes and large, heavy towels. Another nice touch was the stuffed lobster animals the staff brought to our two young daughters! The indoor pool, spa and fitness center area looks to be recently updated with an asian flair. On the three occasions we used the pool and hot tub, we essentially had the place to ourselves, which was a pleasant surprise. The lap pool is decent sized, although it has a constant 4 ft. depth so little ones can't stand up. The only real turn-off for us was the excessive price of the room service menu. Everyone knows that room service is expensive and not a good value overall, but we traditionally get room service on our first night on vacation. However, in this case we felt it would be out of whack even for the most luxurious of hotels. The Sunday breakfast buffet, on the other hand, was outstanding.

We had the 'Do Not Disturb' sign while my wife was still in the room. Not long after I left the room, my wife heard someone knocking on the door lightly. She ignored it since the sign was up. Next thing you know, the house-keeping came in. My wife was very upset because she was still in the bathroom getting ready.

The temp did cool down after several hours, but it was nonetheless annoying since the outside temp was a comfortable 68 degrees but the windows don't open. Construction across the street featured an outdoor generator that roared until 11 p.m. each night, making sleep impossible, but that was beyond the hotel's control. Ask for a room away from construction, though.

We decided that we would treat ourselves to one of the better hotels in the City, to mark the end of our trip and our daughters' school holidays. We picked the Langham, based mainly on the reviews we found on Tripadvisor, but have to say that it did not live up to our expectations. Maybe these were too high, but we have stayed in a wide range of different rented accommodation, at a range of prices, and believe we have a fairly accurate idea of what to expect for our money. The hotel was relatively expensive but our room - a double double - felt cramped and would not have been somewhere we would have wanted to stay for more than the 2 nights we spent there. Cleaniness was good, and the swimming pool more than adequate for a quick splash around after a busy day sight-seeing. As we stayed over Labor Weekend, many of the coffee shops and delis around the hotel were closed so we ate breakfast in the Cafe Fleuri - very expensive for what was, although extensive, a not very appetising selection of cooked food. The waiting staff were polite and friendly, but needed to be asked for refills of coffee more than once. Indeed, pretty much all the staff we met were helpful and accommodating - apart from the rather rude gentleman who checked us in. Having arrived at the hotel before the 3pm check-in time, we were advised by the person at Reception that our room would be ready within the half-hour. Rather than have house-keeping rush to get things done, we said that we would leave our luggage with the Concierge and spend a few hours getting lunch, walking around the harbour etc. We returned more than 3 hours later - and after 3pm - to be told our room wasn't ready and it would be about half an hour before we could get in. When we explained the position and asked whether there was another room we could have, the receptionist relucantly, and with little grace, managed to find us something; in a hotel of this calibre, we might have expected that this was an action that would have been willingly offered rather than one grudgingly agreed to. Because of its location, there is little external noise, and we did not notice noise coming through the walls etc from other rooms so we had restfull nights. And, again because of its location, we were able to explore the city with ease.

However, after my stay I can say I was unimpressed. Here are my comments: The rooms were nice but nothing spectacular. I did like that a bathrobe was provided, and even slippers! However, there wasn't a pen but rather a pencil. Who writes postcards or letters using a pencil? Staff did come in to the room in the evening to provide chocolates and the next day's weather. Room service was way overpriced. $25 for breakfast before delivery fees, service charges, etc. My calculation was it would really be close to $36 by the time all the additional charges were added on. The cocktail lounge was old world elegance and there was a piano player, but $14 for a martini? Come on! One the biggest disappointments for me was the afternoon tea. I had never attended one before so thought this would be the perfect opportunity to do so. I emailed the hotel and received a reply that I should book well in advance. When I showed up, there were only 2 other people there and it didn't change the whole time I was there. In addition, it must have been between lunch and dinner because staff was changing the chairs at the tables around mine, making a lot of banging noises for what I think should have been a peaceful, quite experience. The newspaper provided was a financial newspaper from London, I think. Why not a local paper? Internet service is $10 for 24-hours. Not bad, although I didn't use it. Then, after confirming the charges to my room and receiving my final bill, I checked my credit card account online a few days later to find an additional charge for $4.55. I contacted my credit card company to dispute the charge and they have removed it for now. What could I possibly have purchased or used that would only cost $4.55 at a hotel that charges $25 for breakfast? I bet I couldn't even get coffee for that! All in all, I felt this was a hotel trying too hard to rely on its faded, old world elegance.

We attended a concert in town and didn't want to drive home afterwards. Hotwire had a great rate of under $150 so we booked it. Of course you don't find out the actual hotel until you confirm and pay but matching up the location (financial district) and amenities we had it pretty well narrowed down. Check in was very efficient, bell service was prompt and gave us the lay of the land. The room was excellent, very nicely decorated, boutique hotel style with plush towels and linens, robes, slippers, 600 thread count sheets, the whole 9 yards. Turn down service left chocolates and filled the cooler with ice for our water bottles and sodas. We parked across the street in Post Office Square for 9 bucks a night, very sweet deal for Boston. We hit the bar for some martini's around 4 pm, the drinks were excellent and the bartender quite attentive. He even made dinner reservations for us at the Chart House near the aquarium. Above and beyond service for sure. He also knew the full history of the hotel and the stories behind the old paintings hanging in the bar. Very interesting. Later that night after the concert we hit the lounge again and the piano player was fabulous. The waitress kept the drinks coming and the snack bowl full, the wasabi coated soy beans or peas were spicy and very good. We enjoyed every aspect of the stay although I would say if I was going to pay full rate I'd probably spring for the extra money to be at the Four Seasons. The location is good, although on weekends the financial district is pretty dead. On Sunday we ate breakfast near Downtown Crossing at a place called Kennedy's, that was not so good. Slow and poor service resulting in cold food. The Langham Sunday brunch looked awesome but we had filled up on dinner and for $50 a head, were just not ready to eat that much.

Our room overlooked one of the main hallways, the fitness room and the pool. The towels were firm but not as cushy as I had expected for a hotel of this caliber. Perhaps it's because we were in a \"regular\" room instead of a suite. The bathroom was nothing too remarkable. Because this hotel is in the Financial District, it is not busy on the weekends or after hours. Dunkin' Doughnuts is around the corner for Saturday Morning breakfast. There weren't any convieniece-type stores open to grab snacks (after say, 7pm) and the hotel did not offer any kind of vending. The closest place for late-night-non-pub snacks was at Boston Common.

Her wish involved a shopping spree and show in Boston, and the wish organization booked the Langham for our weekend. The location was great. The public spaces in the hotel are beautiful. The suite was nice. We ate brunch in the hotel and enjoyed excellent service and good food. Our complaint stems from our initial arrival at the hotel. We are two adults and three children. We were told by the wish organization to identify ourselves as the \"wish family\" to ensure special treatment. Well, we felt we received sub-par treatment on our arrival and our wish child felt badly, as she was old enough to notice. Our room was a two-story/family suite. Downstairs was a sleep sofa/sitting area and half bath. Upstairs was the king-size bed and full bath. We needed a cot for our third child, and called the desk to request one, although they should have known we would need one. We went out to dinner, and returned to the hotel to change for the show. Still no cot. We called the desk again, and left for the show. When we returned at 11:00 p.m., there still wasn't a cot. We called down again, frustrated, as we had three tired children. Meanwhile, we opened the sofa bed and not only was it unmade, it was littered with potato chip crumbs. Needless to say, we were very upset and called down again. Finally, the night head of housekeeping came up with a cot and clean sheets for the sofa bed. While he was very apologetic, we feel the hotel dropped the ball. We were not expecting special treatment, but we were appalled that our needs were so blatantly overlooked considering the organization that booked us and the reason we were there. We hesitated complaining to management, as we did not pay for the room and felt awkward. However, when we returned home, we filled out the hotel review form with our experience and checked off the section that asked a manager to call us. No one ever did. Maybe it was just a bad night, but an acknowledgement and apology would have gone a long way.

The good news is that we not only had a room, but it was on the top floor. The staff were polite and the wait was not long. Getting off the elevator, we were assaulted by cigar smoke.

DId I mention that one of the three elevators was out of order? That we packed up in the heat with an exhausted child? There was no offer of help and the process was quite frustrating and long.

The irony is that we ended up OVER tipping because we could not wait longer than 19 minutes for them to collect the check. Go elsewhere! We paid for late check out-but found housekeeping cleaning amongst our belongings with the door wide open when we returned to our room. I had wanted to give my son a bath, but she insisted that we wait as she was, \"almost done.\" I do not fault her, but obviously the communication was poor as she did not believe we were supossed to be there.

Furnishings were lovely and new. The hotel furnishes plush bathrobes and slippers and our nightly turndown service, complete with chocolates on the pillows, made us feel like we were on a cruise ship! The radio was left turned on to a soft music channel - a nice touch. The staff was friendly and accommodating, from Stacey at the front desk, who checked us in and out, to Juan, one of the very nicest bell men ever. The housekeeping staff was right on the mark and we could never pass one of them without receiving a smile and a greeting. The Concierge supplied us with umbrellas for our one rainy day, which were greatly appreciated, since we prefer to walk until our feet fall off (!) when in Boston. The lobby and other public rooms are gorgeous. Sadly, we did not enjoy any meals at the Langham - that will have to wait until our next visit. The only \"annoyance\" was having to go to two floors once and three floors once to find ice! Not a showstopper by any means - just took a little longer to chill our wine!

Checkin was easy and pleasant, and we got our requested room with a view overlooking Post Office Square. The room was a standard king, witha desk, dresser, TV cabinet. It was a little cramped. The bathroom was nice-sized and marble outfitted. A coffeemaker was a pleasant surprise since we didn't expect to find one in a 4* hotel. The bed was on the firm side...which was also unexpected given the emphasis these days on \"heavenly\" etc. comfy hotel beds. Room service and turndown service both were fine. We got used to the evening chocolates very quickly. The public rooms on the second floor are very grand (this building used to be the federal reserve bank) and should not be missed. Saturday night we had cocktails and dinner in the bar. We felt like lords. The piano music added an additional touch of class. We did not check out the pool or gym. The main reception area is understated. We used the concierge twice for basic directions and he was accommodating. The area immediately around the hotel is very quiet on the weekends. Local cafes and eateries tend to be closed. We were told that the Elephant & Castle pub/restaurant on Arch Street (3 blocks away) offers a nice $15 brunch buffet on Sats and Suns, which is a definite bargain compared to the Langham's $50 pp Sunday brunch. We had a good lunch here, but did not check out the brunch. A word about parking: We parked our car in the adjacent parking garage (entrance on Oliver Street) , with an \"ouch\" factor of $78 total. On weekdays, including Friday checkin and Monday checkout, rates hit full-day $32 after approx. 90 minutes. Saturday and Sunday were $7 each.

The little touches were welcome (although only one robe & one pair of slippers for two occupants was a little puzzling!) Turndown with chocalates was lovely touch. The staff are amazing, everyone we saw from porters, front desk & concierge were extremely helpful (it was very helpful to find concierge could provide us with a European - US adaptor, another guest got a phone charger from a hugh box of chargers available! Great idea!) The leisure centre was nice, swimming pool smallish but perfectly adequate. Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to eat or even have a drink at this lovely hotel although I have heard favourable reports though it can apparently be a tad expensive. In relation to the rate for the hotel, we got a very good rate from hotels.com so it was most definitely worth what we paid.

For two people with a tip you are talking about $50 every morning! As an alternative, there is a small park on one side of the hotel and there is a cafe in the park which does lots of salads, sandwiches and stuff like that. If you like trying different food, it might be worth going to their Sunday Brunch, which is $50 per person, but it's all you can eat and they have a huge variety of food - crab claws, shrimp, pasta stir fries cooked on the spot, pancakes, chicken are just a sample.
