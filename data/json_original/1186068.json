The room we had was tiny. We barely managed to find place for our bags. There is no closet. The bathroom was also very small and the door closed only from the outside. Sheets were old, smelly and with lots of stains. The TV was old and had a bad picture. The AC was to loud. Breakfast was served in an office next to the motel and there is no place to seat and eat, but if you are fan of the cheapest cereal you can take it to your room. There is a Wi-Fi network but it didn't work and the receptionist couldn't help us since he barely spoke English. The only good thing is the location, it's a 2 minute walk from the Chinese Theater and the walk of fame.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNever again!\u201d", "Author": "Skoda12", "ReviewID": "UR119480273", "Content": "We wasn't expecting too much from this hotel as we only want somewhere to sleep.

Worst experience ever!!!!\u201d", "Author": "mcmuffin12", "ReviewID": "UR81256102", "Content": "Expect harassment from management for no reason at all. The foreign couple who runs the inn is rude and has terrible communication. The manager calls me after I check-in and demands payment for additional people staying over even though it was only my wife and I there. For whatever crazy reason, he believes I will throw some massive sleepover party and he wants money for it. After telling him that we\u2019re not having anyone over, he calls again and threatens that he will have security take me to the police station. Later, as expected, the security guy comes a knockin and of course, he finds no other people around. When the couple felt the need to abruptly end a conversation, the husband would start saying \u201cMoney, money, money, money\u201d accompanied by the gimme money hand gesture. When I tried to talk over that annoyance, his wife would jump in chanting the same. Then they would run away from the front desk. It was surreal. I thought I was in an episode of Seinfeld. The bathroom is tiny. There is literally about 6-8 inches of space between the front of the toilet and the wall/door. So you cannot sit down normally to use it. The manager\u2019s wife also does the cleaning as they are too cheap to hire staff which explains why it\u2019s not clean there. Bottom line, DO NOT RENT here. I wouldn\u2019t stay for free.

Whilst in San Francisco, I rang the hotel to advise that we had some issues with our flight and that we would be checking in on the 7th instead of the 6th. The person who answered the phone did not understand English well and seemed to misunderstand me, and tried to confirm that I would be arriving a day *earlier* instead of later as I had tried to explain. I said no, we are coming the day *after* we are supposed to check in, is that OK? - the person on the other end of the line said \"Fine, see you then\" and hung up. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted with abuse because they had been expecting us a day earlier than our check in date. The proprietor of the hotel then started shouting at us that we had rang on the 4th and said we would be arriving on the 5th. We in fact had told them that we had rang on the 5th and advised that we would be arriving on the 7th. The manager then advised that if we wanted to stay there, we would have to pay for the \"extra night\" that we had \"rang and booked on the 4th\". I was glad to take my business elsewhere and pay the booking cancellation fee rather than stay there, it looked terrible.

It's nothing but trouble. The hotel (if you can call it that) is right off the blvd so anyone on the main street had easy access to your car and hotel rooms (you can walk right from the street to the hallways of the establishment). You will hear noises from the street all night. We got a NON-SMOKING twin double bed to find out that the room was complete with cigarette smoke AND an ash tray. When questioned why it was the case, the hotel staff nicely explained that he could not stop guest from smoking. The bathroom was filthy, no bath tub (even if there was, we would not go in there), just standing showers. The A/C unit looks like it's from the 1970s and it surely produces more dust and dirt than breathable air. Last but not least my boyfriend woke up with BEDBUG BITES all over his body (I was spared, for some reason). It was the worst experience of the trip.

There was hanging space for clothes and the sheets seemed clean. The bathroom door did not shut completely and the room was quite dark, partly due to the lack of window light. When I opened the curtains in the morning the view was a brick wall and there were pigeons nesting on the window ledge which was very messy. The free takeaway breakfast was tea/coffee and fruit, pastries and donuts. If you are on a tight budget, the hotel is OK.
