The patio and the bistro set was an added bonus, but we really didn't use it because of the heat. Thank goodness it was air-conditioned because August is too hot in Rome. The daily breakfast was wonderful and had a big variety of choices to eat except for eggs. It was in a location that you were able to walk either to Vatican City or to the Spanish Steps.

The halls are full of smoke. The service it pitiful. They did not show us around, did not point out where breakfast was, that there even was an internet room, they basically just gave us the room key - that's it. Plus when we first entered our room - our complimentary robes were placed INSIDE the bidet!!! The shower head fell off when I took a shower and clocked me on the head. I asked to change rooms and they refused. (they did fix the problem though). We were also promised the room on the web site - a nice, new, spacious, clean room with a terrace. However, we were given a super small, old, dusty, gross room with a balcony that the doors were so rusted shut that they squealed like fingernails on a chalkboard to open.

The front desk personnel were accommodating, but not friendly. The breakfast was pretty good, there was a wide variety of choices: fruit, pastries, rolls, yougurt, cereals and some meat and cheeses. The coffee was good and the wait staff were nice. We booked our room at the last minute (3 weeks out) so probably paid more than we should although the hotel did give us a sizeable discount (~30%) because we were staying for 7 nights---I did ask for the discount on booking, and there was no issue upon check out. We used thier 'car service' to pick us up from FCO when we arrived in Rome, it was kind of pricey 60E especially when I found out that the driver wasn't affiliated with the hotel, they hotel was just the middleman in this case. I made a reservation with airportconnection[-] to get us back to FCO and they were great 44E for a Mercedes S class and our drive was about 30 minutes early. Overall our stay at the Tiziano was good.", "Date": "October 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mashpee, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cComfortable Hotel\u201d", "Author": "kesp80", "ReviewID": "UR3945794", "Content": "My husband and I stayed for three nights, and although the room was small for the amount of money we spent, we were very comfortable. We had a king sized bedroom facing the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, and thought that we would hear the constant traffic.The recent implementation of soundproof windows blocked all sound and the shutters that were closed at night, made the room very dark, which made us catch up on our sleep. The bathroom was bright, clean, well kept and tiled. There was a marble top sink, which had enough space to hold your toiletries and a glass enclosed tub/shower, which by the way, had a terrific shower head. This hotel is centrally located to all sites. The Pantheon and Piazza Navona are about a five minute walk.The Trastevere area was a pleasant 15-20 minute walk. The bus and cable car station is right on the corner.The only time we used public transportation was to visit the Vatican The continental breakfast was terrific and the coffee strong. The breakfast room held about ten tables or about 50 people. The waitstaff were very pleasant. We experienced very helpful hotel managers. They work many hours and seem to be very dedicated to your needs and we really felt that they wanted us to have a great time in Rome. All in all, we had a very pleasant stay at Tiziano, and would stay there again.", "Date": "September 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ann Arbor, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "AnnArbor", "ReviewID": "UR3616678", "Content": "Ideal location just a few hundred yards from both Piazza Navona and the Pantheon, with many outstanding restaurants and good shopping nearby.

The Pantheon is within a couple of hundred yards and the Vatican & Forum equidistant. For the less able a taxi rank is very close by & a bus stop is outside the hotel.

Let me start with the good points of the Hotel. It is in a fantastic location - close to everything. There are wonderful shops and restaurants nearby. The hotel entrance was impressive, the rooms were clean, the ceilings grand. The complimentary breakfast was wonderful. The downside to it all? The front desk person was unapproachable. He did his job, but made one feel incredibly unwelcome with his standoffish demeanor. I dreaded every moment I had to pass by the front desk, and that feeling alone just doesn't hold well for what's supposed to be a 'relaxing and enjoyable' stay. Besides that unfortunate glitch, I still I had a fabulous time overall in Rome.
