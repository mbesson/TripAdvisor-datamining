{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Extras in the Disco! This hotel is located in the business district and is about a 15 minute taxi journey to Forbidden City. The hotel is rated as 4*, however would say it was only just 3*. The facilities are located between 2 buildings, the second building being slightly run down and old fashioned. There was however an excellent restaurant here which was packed with both locals and western visitors - pre-booking was advised.The rooms were ok, nothing special; staff struggled with some requests as their English and my Chinese were on differing levels!The one big eyeopener was the Disco in the basement which infact was many small rooms in which you can sing Karaoke and have drinks with many of the hostesses! Basically a high class expensive brothel that offers much more than a dance!", "Date": "Mar 28, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR474415494", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ukagt"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d535186-r3306615-China_Garment_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "535186", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
