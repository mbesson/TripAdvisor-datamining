The hotel is close to the Zoo Garten train station, which serves both the S and U bahn so it's a good springboard to get around all of Berlin. The famous Kudamm and KaDeWe are extremely close by. Chose this hotel cause the photos seemed interesting and the price was right for the couple of nights we stayed in Berlin. As soon as you walk into the lobby you know you're not at an old world hotel. The decor was kind of Warholesque. Splashes of color and eclectic furnishings make up the lobby. Check-in was quick and easy. The front desk personnel spoke English fairly well. We got our key and headed up to our room. The layout was basic and simple, but the decor seemed like something out of the '80s in a weird New Wave way. Very kitschy. Aside from the decor, the room was a comfortable size with a good bathroom. No bath, but shower was a good size to be able to move around in. The room came with 2 full size beds and seemed new as there was no give to them, but were quite comfortable. The entire room was clean and we never felt like there was anything that seemed out of place. Our room did face the street and there was a little bit of noise from the outside, but it seemed that one window wasn't closed properly so noise seeped in. Once we figured that out, we closed it correctly and the problem was solved.

A package was offered for an xs-room. I arrived at about 19.00 hrs and was welcomed by a very friendly staff member. Since reviewers here said that the road infront of the hotel is noisy I was happy that not only my preference for a high floor was granted, I was even given a room showing to the rear. Infact, the room was extra small! But nevertheless it was clean, well appointed and beside the amenities included in the package (bottle of wine, fruit plate) I also had a bottle of mineral water in my room. The room was stylish and the original art works (painting) gave an extra special touch. The bath room was comparetivley large (shower only). A welcome letter was waiting written in a warm welcoming style and giving some useful information. The hotel bar adjacent to the small lobby looks nice. The bar tender was absent but again the receptionist was very kind and she took my order instead. In the morning the breakfeast room was empty but when filling I realised that it must be noisy when full. And there is not much room between tables. So getting to the buffet might be cumbersome for all parties involved. The breakfast items were of good quality (the choice of bread was a bit small, though). I really enjoyed their coffee, very good quality. Here again, breakfast staff was very kind. All in all, it was an experience much better than expected. I found staff great.

Few meters away is Kumfusterdamm station and in 5minutes walking distance is Zoo garden central station (take RE7 or RE14 from/to Schonefeld airport) Close to Zoo garden station is a supermarket where you can get all the basics (it was open on Sunday too) Our room was in 1st floor facing the main road. The room was not very spacious but this wasn't any problem for us. It was very clean, quite and comfortable. THe only negative aspect was that the hotel does not offer free WiFi which I think is essential/basic in our days SInce we didn't take breakfast at the hotel, our only interaction with the staff was during Check In/Out process.

Once you arrive at Tegel or Schonefeld airport, I would recommend taking the Regional line (No.14) to the Zoological Garten station, from there it is a 5-10 minute walk to Joachimstaler Strasse, the hotel is easily found on the left side of the street, opposite the Metropole. - The hotel The hotel lobby was clean and spacious is appearance, with a really nice bar/seating area. The reception staff are friendly and checking in does not take a long time. I could tell that the hotel was an old hotel revamped into something more modern, with new paintings and artistic stuff placed subtley around the lobby/corridors. There is Wifi available for free the first day but chargeable thereafter if you want it. Would not recommend it's speed if you are working in your room on business, but for a quick Facebook-fix on your mobile it is ok, just use it free the first day and use McDonalds etc the rest of your stay. - Room The double-room I booked was clean, warm and bright. The bathroom, albeit basic, was tidy and looked-after with a great shower. There was the usual small TV with a selection of German stations and free English-speaking news channels and Eurosport, a minibar and very large double bed! Our room was at the front of the hotel overlooking Joachimstaler Strasse. This road was only busy in the mornings. There is a small arcade with a nightclub across the road. As we stayed in the hotel mid-week, this was not really an issue, however on the Wednesday night, the nightclub was busy with drunk people smoking outside up to 6am. This does not really bother me as it is just another noise you should expect on a city break, however if you are a light sleeper or easily irritated, I would recommend asking for a room at the back of the hotel. You may get the odd siren but there is no other overly-audible loud noises, like trains etc. as Joachimstaler Strasse is just off the main road. - Location The hotel is on a street which I guess is mainly offices. On a larger scale, the area is a part of Berlin that has the big city-centre feel, but also feels very safe, as there are many big name shops all along Kurfurstendamm which is only 5 mins walking distance from the hotel, as well as the Europa Centre which is good for shopping and eating out, but not many nightclubs. There is a Lidl in the Metropole arcade across from the hotel, for alcohol/cigarettes there is a Netto on Augsberger Strasse round the corner. There is a small traditional German bar/restaurant right beside the hotel which looked really nice and very reasonably priced, but I did not get the chance to try it. I would recommend Pizzaria Via Veneto, a great italian restaurant on the corner of Lietzenburger Strasse and Bliebtreustrasse. For a better variation of restaurants or nightlife, I would recommend you hop on the train from Zoological Garten to Potzdamer or Alexanderplatz areas. The main sites and nightlife would be around these places. Unrelated, a special recommendation from me would be the free walking tour leaving from starbucks at Brandenburg Gate at 11 or 1. And the best nightlife is beside the Warshaur U-Bahn. The trains only take 10 mins getting you to these places, so I think the hotel is ideally located in a busy but quieter area with very easy and quick access to the main sites. Overall, the hotel is good for it's price and has a calm atmosphere in and around it. It may not look central when checking on the map, but it takes no longer than 15 minutes getting to the main attractionsfrom the second you walk out the front of the building, and there is plenty to see/do around the hotel. I would recommend you do not stay in the hotel for too long though, as every minute you do, you are missing out on seeing something amazing in this awesome city.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTrendy hotel, close to public transport but road noisy\u201d", "Author": "maat49", "ReviewID": "UR87277286", "Content": "Rooms clean and tidy; staff helpful; good continental breakfast; five minutes walk from transport links to all Berlin and districts.

The Ku'damm area has lots of shops and good restaurants, if your main interest is in Brandenburger Tor / Museuminsel / Reichstag etc you might prefer art'otel Mitte, but I have not been there.

The location and price were excellent, and we rather liked the very kitsch interiors. However: After our 1st night, we were awoken at about 8 o clock by a series of incredibly loud bangs, which sounded like building work. The bangs went on for over an hour. At first we weren't sure what the noise was, so we rang reception to ask what they were and how long they would continue for and they just said they would 'send someone up' (which they never did). We went and had a look and saw that the building work was going on on our floor very close to our room- it must have been planned, so we thought it was a little inconsiderate to put us there. The next day, at about 9, somebody knocked on the door- I wasn't wearing anything-at all- so very clearly shouted (politely!) to hold on. Even if the person did not speak English, the tone of my voice made it clear I did not want to be disturbed. About a second later, this man just opened the door and I had to practically throw myself into a towel to protect my decency! He was dressed in incredibly scruffy, dirty clothes (not like a uniform) and had a dirty bucket behind him and rag in his hand. He just laughed and shut my door. I found this quite upsetting because I wanted to know how he had a keycard to my room, but I just put it down to 'one of those things' and went back to bed. About half an hour later *exactly the same thing happened.* The whole scenario played itself out again entirely. This really p*ssed me off, and actually frightened me a little bit, so when we went downstairs we told reception (politely, I am rather meek by nature) who did not apologise or seem to care at all. The two receptionists looked at each other and GIGGLED, and then one turned to me and with a look of disdain said, \"oh, do you mean the BLACK man\". Without meaning to sound paranoid, it was clear she basically thought I was being racist by complaining (total bollocks, I was complaining about a random man walking into my room at 9 am with no explanation). She told me he was a cleaner, and I thought well OK fair enough he was employed by the hotel, but he was dressed and acted completely unprofessionally, and who cleans a room at 9am? I tried to explain my concern but both the women at reception were just completely uninterested and did not care at all. In fact, throughout our stay, we found the service utterly terrible, staff very rude and dismissive, and who seemed infuriated that you might actually require some help. We (my boyfriend and I) have stayed in a LOT of hotels (it's sort of a hobby), and being only 19 we generally don't find alot to complain about and can adapt happily to most situations, but this one undoubtedly had the worst service out of about 40+ hotels we've stayed in in the last 3 years.", "Date": "June 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cTwo thumbs up\u201d", "Author": "mpdesjardins", "ReviewID": "UR30839565", "Content": "Got this hotel on Priceline for 60 USD / night, which is a quite a good rate for a 3-star hotel in the Tiergarten area.

Great Breakfast but a bit costly 14 euros a person. room was clean the bathroom was clean the shower had great water pressure and temp was perfect (no tub). Mini Bar and snacks in the room, replenished daily. bed was firm but comfortable as well as 2 different styles of pillows (4 all together) and two separate comforters. Room had a safe in which you make the code for! hotel had a room in the lobby area to iron your clothes, so no iron in room. my only comlaint was the A/C. it didn't get cool enough. and if you left the window open (which i don't recomend) you can hear all the street noise till the wee hrs of the morning. once the windows were closed you heard no outside noise! we stayed there the second week of oct. so it wasn't hot outside. yet we like to sleep with cool air going. like a minute walk to the Kurfursten underground station. 5 mins to Zoologischer train station (One of the Main stations).

Since I was travelling with my business partner, I booked a twin-bedded room. For those who are not familiar with that, it means that the rooms has two separate beds, each one for 1 person. On arrival, we have been allocated a room, nothing was said. We went up to the room and discovered the room only had one large bed and that there was no possibility at all to get two beds. Sometimes this is in fact two mattress with a zip between. I went down to the reception and got several consecutive bad answers. First one was \"twin room does not mean two beds, it means two persons\". I answered that I had been working in hospitality + have been travelling over the world and that they were lying to me. 2nd answer: \"we never confirmed a twin room, it was just a preference.\" I had to switch on my laptop and got the confirmation where it was written \"twin room confirmed\" 3rd answer: \"we have no twin room. That's it and you'll change tomorrow\". Then I said that if I was her, I would first apologize for my mistake and that second I would check and check again every other reservation and find a solution. I would at least look embarassed. She was not at all and I was just bothering her. From there, I did ask to check name by name the next arrivals until we could find a single person having a twin room. While doing that, the guy next to me was alone and was checking in a twin room. I asked him to switch and he kindly accepted. The girl there was on duty, she refused to call a manager, she refused to call anyone else, she refused to book me a room in another hotel and she did not express any interest about my situation. She has no understanding of her guest needs and she lies. Otherwise the hotel was good, good value, good breakfast, good location, good room size for Berlin. The bar was okay.

I found the hotel to be very acceptable with helpful staff, comfortable / well fitted / clean rooms, attractive bar area and an unsupassed location for shops (KaDeWe - 5 mins walk / Kurfurstendamm - 30 second walk) Transport links (the Zoo' S bhan & bus terminal - 5 mins walk / U-Bhan -30 second walk / Tigel Aiport - \u20ac15>20 taxi / schonefeld - \u20ac30 > 35). This hotel provided me with eveything i needed for my stay as when i travel to locations around the world i do so to enjoy the destination, not the hotel (which so many people who have written reviews on this hotel seem to have done). my advice to these people is find a good hotel in their home town and go there - its cheaper and easier. This hotel IS NOT a 7* palace and it does not advertise itself as such. like wise (to the people who question the quality of the breakfast) it is not a michlin starred restaurant. With this in mind, if you want a quality breakfast (whilst not compromising on convenience too much) try the wintergarten (two streets away off the Kdam) - it is a specialist in providing breakfast (rather than hotel rooms) and does so at a similar price to the art hotel. The only justified problem that has been brought up in other reviews is the noise levels in the rooms to the front of the hotel. The walls do not seem to offer sufficient insulation to keep out tire noise which some (shallow sleeping) guests might find annoying. however, there are plenty of rooms which do not face the road and therefore do not suffer this problem. All in all. if you are looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable, clean hotel situated in a very good location; this is the one for you.

However, I'm disappointed to say that the reality did not match my expectations. First big shock is the lack of 'art' around the place... but then I am willing to admit that I'm not an art expert, so maybe I missed these treasures. The reception area is clean and tidy and the bar area certainly looks like it belongs in a design hotel. There is a decent wifi connection on the ground floor, but nothing once you venture to your room. A shame, as I was travelling on business and this was a major irritation. I booked a standard room. It was a nice size room, a jazzy / artsy carpet and a comfortable bed. The 70s lingered in the bathroom and the poor quality of the towels was another annoyance. Little touches such as toiletries (shampoo, soap etc) were replaced with tubs of generic soap attached to the wall... functional, but lacks that little sense of luxury that you want from a hotel. The biggest problem for me was the noise at night. A room on the front of the hotel is unbearable because of the noise from the nightclub opposite. I had to move rooms (and pay \u20ac20 for the 'upgrade') to the back of the building. I'm not an early riser, so perhaps this is a lesson to me, but the breakfast was atrocious. There were plenty of sausages floating in tepid water, but little else by way of hot food. When they did finally notice that the scrambled eggs had run out and refilled it, the hungry hoards descended, leaving a few scraps. I gave up all hope of having any eggs for breakfast at all. That said, the cheese selection was good and the bread rolls were still warm, which is a nice treat. I certainly won't be staying here again, and I would only recommend this hotel for those who need to be near KaDeWe, but can't afford the Swissotel on the corner. Given the multitude of other design hotels in Berlin (and plenty near the ku'damm already!) this is a truly mediocre hotel.", "Date": "October 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cOkay for the price\u201d", "Author": "GlobalJana", "ReviewID": "UR10031773", "Content": "I booked this hotel for one night and would not recommend staying here unless you're on a budget.
