The reception staff are a bit abrupt and 1 staff member tried to charge us more than the other for the room. But I'm sure this happens elsewhere as well. Check in and out was swift.

This hotel is quite tacky with things for sale in the bathroom and a box of condoms by the bed--all for sale! Everything smelled like cigarettes.Worst of all, the hotel staff speak the most minimum of English and whatever English they understand is wrong. When my friends and I were asking for a better room, telling them we were willing to pay the difference, they thought we were asking for an extra bed. When I thought I was being asked how I booked the hotel and I told them I got it through the Internet, they thought I was complaining about the Internet access in my room (which is free because it doesn't work by the way).The bell boys, after bringing you to your room, will try to sell you tours or get you taxis that overcharge. My friends and I were so fed up with this hotel, we moved out of it to spend our last night in Beijing in Novotel Peace Hotel, a hotel next door to this awful place. If you want to have a comfortable stay in Beijing, do not choose this hotel. The rooms are bare, the bathrooms are tiny, and the staff are rude and very unhelpful.", "Date": "Mar 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR654353269", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TravelingPinay"}, {"Content": "Adequate but not fancy I spent 2 nights at the TaiWan hotel in June 2007. The room was clean and basic, but how much time do you spend in a hotel room anyways? There was some noise from the construction site across the street that seemed to go on until about 10 pm each night. My only complaint about the place was the constant barrage of solicitations I received as I returned to the hotel in the evening, asking me if I wanted a massage or a girl. I'm not sure why these people are even allowed on hotel property.

Good location. I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my sis, and the room is pretty good. The cleanliness is up to par but the best thing is the location. Given out budget of under SGD$100 per night, this is the best deal. Dont expect service and It doesnt matter if you speak the language, cos i do. We didnt get any service inside the hotel or in the city in general. the staff are always so impatient when we asked for directions. Ironically we get better services when we speak English first before switching to Mandarin.... The hotel is near the famous night market selling food and about 2 minutes walk to the beginning of Wangfujing shopping street. There are plenty of shops here, including Watsons (essential for me to get my facial mask packs- my skin was drying up under the dry weather).It takes abt 10-15 mins to walk to the Wangfujing subway staion, and the forbidden city is a 10-15 mins train ride away. It is not so feasible to take trains and buses to beijing touristy places. You can but you will waste a lot of time. ultimately it makes more sense to cab (avoid rush hour). Always take the cab receipt in case you left something in the cab.

The hotel was in a good location, very close to the Wanfujing street area and about a 20 minutes walk to the subway. The room was worn but clean and comfortable. However, we wished we had read the reviews before booking the hotel. Upon checking out of the hotel and heading to the airport, the doormen didn't give a choice and put our suitcases in the taxis waiting outside and we got cheated big time. Since we were a family of 5 and needed 2 taxis, we got purposely separated, the first taxi driving like a maniac in speeds in excess of 90 mph!. The meter was rigged and went up to 200 RMB. I was able to drill the man down to 150 RMB but my wife, feeling intimidated by the taxi driver, paid the full price. It ended costing our family of 5 a total of 350 RMB for the ride to the airport! They gave one of us a bogus receipt, which didn't show anything. When we tried to complain at the airport, they said there was nothing they could do unless we pro-longed our stay in the city by a few days. Of course, that was not possible. Overall, we had no complaints about staying in this hotel, but do not trust taking the taxis from this hotel!!!!", "Date": "Jan 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR853608830", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "onechinatrav"}, {"Content": "For the price it was adequate We stayed at this hotel for 1 week in June 06 - and for the price it was fine.

Whilst we had no real problems with the rooms, we too found the staff to be a bit less than helpful at times. We were also dismayed by the incredibly high cost of using the Internet in the Business Centre (stay away and find access down the street), and were pretty annoyed when the breakfast buffet was cleared away around us. Anyhow, that aside, the biggest issue was with the taxis that were called by the doorman/porter on our departure. These particular taxis were called from just around the corner, where they had been waiting for unsuspecting tourists to rip off. Not only was the taxi driver rude, yelling into to his cell phone for 5 minutes before I had a go at him, he tried to overcharge us also. As we had caught a taxi from the airport to the hotel on arrival, we knew the distance was 27km and the cost about 85Y - imagine our surprise when we noticed the meter climbing through 100Y with at least 10km to go to the airport. After asking him why it was so expensive and much discussion with my wife about the correct fare (including some calculations in accordance with the fare brochure that was conveniently located in the back of the driver's seat), he eventually turned off the meter with a couple of kilometers to go, though not before I had noticed that he had added about 25km to the meter. Once at the airport he handed me invoice at 150Y to which I laughed and had a stand-up argument with him, indicating that I knew what he had done and was going to report him. I eventually paid him 80Y for the trip. Unfortunately, our friends who were leaving the next day, did not recieve our warning SMS and being a little less confident than I, they actually paid 200Y for the same trip.I tried to report the taxi to the authorities at the time, but the language barrier was too much, so when I got home I reported him through the hotel, faxing the invoice to prove the added kilometers. Initially the hotel indicated that he had been reported to his company (though not sure about the traffic enforcement authority, who are trying to crack down on this in the lead-up to the 2008 Olympics), and further that the taxi company was going to send me 150Y. However, when I learned about my friends being ripped off, I questioned the hotel about whether they would be refunded, and have neither heard from the hotel since nor received any 150Y.In summary, it is my strong opinion that the hotel is very aware that the taxis it is calling are ripping off tourists, and is doing nothing to prevent it. My advice - DON'T STAY HERE, but if you do, DON'T LET THE DOORMAN CALL YOU A TAXI, get your own from the street and know how much it costs to get around as well as keep an eye on the meter (which is easy to decipher and conveniently indicates distance travelled and rate per kilometer).I hope this helps some prospective China travellers out there.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR167499881", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Triangle_Man"}, {"Content": "its not a language barrier- just plain rude i stayed at the taiwan hotel this week for 5 days and i was horrified by the service i recieved here. because i live in korea it was easy for me to be understanding that there are cultural and language barriers and i should be able to cut some slack for this but my patience wore thin after a few run in with the front desk women- lets call them the dragon ladies- the dragon ladies answered every question i asked with rude facial expressions, swears in chinese and bitter contempt at having to converse with me in any way. When i first arrived i was told the the promised 'free' room safes in fact required a large deposit for the key- this really irked me and when i mentioned that this was not mentioned in their add they did not act apologetic- their response to me was 'so?' When i arrived to my room it was not ready for me so i had to wait over an hour for the cleaning crew to come in and clean- this is after i told the hotel exactly the time and date i would arrive. we had a problem with our telelvision working when we first booked in and we asked the front desk to send someone up to help us- we were required to ask 4 times over a period of 2 days as they lied and never sent anyone. any question re location of something or exchanging money was met with an icey stare and angry sighs- once when we came to the desk and merely asked if there was internet access we could use we were told brusqley to wait- she then proceeded to do paperwork in front of us for over 5 mins and then finally saidwhat? in the rudest of voices to us.Besides the front desk service - which was atrocious i also experienced the spa service upsatirs the first night and all i can say is i am embarrassed for the hotel that they are providing this kind of poor service to their clients- the massage was awful and it seemed like the girl who i got who chatted with her friend in the other room while she poked my ribs and made nasty comments about my body- she is obviously someone who does not enjoy her job- and the rooms they have alloted for the massages were dirty and small and felt rather seedy. i also expereienced the business center where i was charged 2 yuan a min which for 18 mins ended up costing me 36 yuan( over 4 $ for 20 mins!!!!) i thought this was outrageous to charge this rate to their own hotel clients.lastly the air conditioners in the room left me with a horrible cold which i think was partially due to the fact i doubt their cleanliness- the air smelled stale the three redeeming qualities of this hotel were the basement restaurant which was a gem- full of ambiance, and very attentive service; the maid service which was great and they were invisible but their work was carefully done and the room was clean; and finally the location which was good but to be honest the novotel was right next door and i know for a fact that novotel prides itself on their good service ( i stayed with them in thailand) trust me the location is not worth the hassles you will experience here- there is also construction underway across the road which begins at 6am and is loud!i would tell anyone who was going to go to beijing to avoid the taiwan hotel- i will certainly never return!", "Date": "Aug 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR539163988", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dragonflygirl"}, {"Content": "A bag of tricks I stayed at the Taiwan hotel for a week, over Labour day bank holiday.

The room was very clean and cleaned to good standards everyday. A little noisy due to the location opposite a building site that worked 24 hours a day, and the car horns outside but nothing that wasn't unreasonable. You can have a breakfast there, but unless it is uncluded I wouldn't bother unless you can eat a horse. The staff were friendly but lacking in English as most chinese are. We had a camera stolen from our bag at the temple of heaven and reported it to reception as the insurace said to do. Their security man wouldn't write a report as it didn't happen on the hotel premisis and told us to report it to the police where it happened. We bought a phone card from the shop in the foyer said we could use it in our room. When we got the bill there was a connection charge for every time we used it, about 24 yen a go which soon added up! As you have to give a 500 yen deposit on check in don't expect to get it all back.
