The location is perfect - just between San Marco and the Rialto. Easy reach from the airport - vaporetto/water bus takes it 40-50 min from the Marco Polo airport to the Rialto pier which is 3-5 min walk from the hotel. Try not to take bus or car from the airport cause it will get you to the central bus station and you should then walk the same 40-50 min. to the hotel or take water taxi. We booked a \"channel view\" room. One of 3 (!) room windows was just above the bridge, opening the view on the charming street with murano glass shops and restaurants with fresh seafood on ice. Nice thing about this channel and bridge is that when it's raining, gondolas will stop straight under the bridge to keep their passengers dry. Some of those gondolas come with singers who don't stop their (prepaid) songs regardless of the weather. So during the short rainy moments you will get some nice free entartainement. Very romantic. There's a charming roof terrace in the hotel with views on the surrounding streets and tiled roofs . Very nice just to sit for a while and sip some wine. A nice touch to the overall great impression you will get from Venice. The only reproach to the hotel - rather poor breakfast (regular for Italy) with a horrible chemical undrinkable coffee...", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cCharming Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Faribs", "ReviewID": "UR127780818", "Content": "Great price, Great location with a view of the cannal without paying the price of having the view and great breakfast with fresh fruits and a lot more.

In general the San Marco area is overrun and crowded with people, however this was off a main street so the immediate area felt like a nice reprieve from the crush of tourists swarming the endless number of glass shops and clothing stores/boutiques. My main put-off of the hotel would be its steep stairs and no elevator. As Americans may tend to, we overpacked and had a number of heavy bags to lug up the stairs. The 2nd floor is the lobby, and our room was another 2 or 3 floors up from there. As we checked in the worker was generally nice enough but also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flinch for a second as if he was going to assist with our bags \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is in line with the overall courtesy we saw in Venice compared with Tuscany and Rome, but I digress. The hotel room was small but in line with Europe standards. However the bath room was VERY small and cramped. It was 8 feet long but maybe 3 feet wide and that makes for a rough effort to walk past the toilet/bidet combo just to get to the shower (much less using one of those which ended up with knees on the facing wall, so yes, it is cramped). But, it was clean both in the room, bathroom and throughout which always is a plus and encouraging sign. I booked online a few months ago and my reservation went off without a hitch and they were ready for us (also a good sign). We left at 6am on our departure date as we were catching the first ferry to the airport from San Marco. The overnight worker was actually extremely nice. He fired up the coffee machine and pulled out some food for us before we left, which he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do since breakfast didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcofficially\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 start til 7 or so.

Breakfast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c No, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a full, gluttonous spread like your average Courtyard Marriott or what most Americans are accustomed to back home. They had the standard Italian breakfast which can be good and satisfying (plus not overeat) of yogurt, fruit, rolls, coffee, etc. Overall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the location and price were good, the bathroom size being the main drawback (but not a prohibitive feature unless we stayed more then the 3 days we did).

We arrived at night on the vapparetto from the airport and the walk across San Marco and into a narrow street and over the bridges to the hotel was magical. The staff in the Hotel were always friendly and helpful, the night porter being the nicest. The room we had was on the top floor and was perfectly clean. It was a good size with an alcove with a wardrobe and space for the bags, it was nice not to have to look at the bags during our stay. The decor in the room was a bit old fashioned but it is an old hotel and that is one of it's strengths, it is solid and quiet, you can't here any other guests going about their business. The bathroom was a good size, modern and clean. The breakfast was fine, nothing spectacular, but there was enough variety so you wouldn't have the same food every day. I would stay here again and would recommend it to all my friends without fear of the hotel letting me down.", "Date": "September 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cComfortable hotel in convenient location\u201d", "Author": "STL531", "ReviewID": "UR18465197", "Content": "My family (parents and two college-age daughters) stayed in this hotel for three nights while visiting Venice.

By walk you can go to the central St. Marco square and visit many other interesting places surrounding this hotel. The room was very very nice, it has a typical venice style, all the hotel was very typical and a little elegant, we had the breakfast included in the price and it was served in a nice room and was good.

If you are going to visit Venice we suggest this hotel, but not if you are a low budget traveller because for us it was quite expensive, even if it deserves the money.
