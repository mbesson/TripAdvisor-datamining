The hotel provides free shuttle rides to and fom the beaches and also free shuttle rides to the malls - they r a must see, esp the wadi mall and the emirates mall - The breakfast got a bit boring as it was the same choices daily. the only change was the way the prepared the eggs.

Its OK for a quick 1 night stay if you are flying out early in the morning (as I was). They offer a free hourly shuttle bus to the airport for this pupose. I would be very disappointed if I was here for my 14 day holiday (I think my girlfriend would have actually cried if this were the case so fella's spend the extra \u00a320 a night and get somewhere decent!). Location is OK, its in Deira the (the otherside of Dubai Creek) which is close to the airport, Gold Souk and Bur Dubai (which has some places to go out in). Also not too far from Sheikh Zayed Rd either (15 mins) but far out from Jumeirah and the Marina nightlife (maybe 30-45 mins with no traffic). Saying that the downturn in Dubai means that the traffic is not so bad anymore and for the first time ever there were taxis... everywhere, so perhaps location is not as important any longer! Taxi's are also very cheap here compared to UK and in Dubai (unlike Abu Dhabi) they will always use the meter. Rooms- dirty, toilet was not clean although someone had gone to the trouble of putting one of those 'steralised' strips across it which was a joke. Shower was luke warm and no power whatsoever. Shower curtain stank, and bathroom was musty and mouldy in places. The rest of the room was very basic but bearable. The nightclub is on floor 2 so stay high if you can as it will keep you awake if your a light sleeper. One last thing, do not go for a massage, I made this mistake and after 5 mins of what I would call rubbing rather than massaging I was offered \"extra's\" which was not what I was after!!!!!!! Overall, I would reccomend you stay somewhere else (perhaps try the IBIS at World Trade Center- same price when I booked for the first night of my stay and only 5 mins over the bridge so still okay for airport) but this was the cheapest room on lastminute the day I booked it... what do you expect!", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toledo", "Title": "\u201cdid not like it\u201d", "Author": "ToledoMaadi", "ReviewID": "UR22994247", "Content": "They do not respect what they have posted in their website.

On arrival, we didn't have to wait too long (5/6 minutes) to get our room, which was on the 6th floor, so we didn't have any noise issues that others have noted. Hotel is in a location that is close to a smaller mall that has some decent dining options - Pizza hut, Papa John's, a nice filipino place, a nice iranian place, etc. There are a number of other 3-star hotels in the same locality. It is also just a few minutes walk away from the \"Diera Bus Station\" water-bus stop, from where you can take a water-bus across the creek to Bur-Dubai for Dhs 4. The downsides of K-Porte Inn - rooms are small, and quite bare-bones - no coffee maker even; we had to ask for an extra towel every morning - even though we were 2, there would always only be 1 towel. Also, at about 9 / 9:30 PM each night, we would come across women (likely hookers) hanging around between the hotel and the mall - they never bothered us, but it was just unpleasent. The staff at K-Porte are courteous, but just don't have enough information on place to see, etc. The free shuttle service to malls / jumeirah beach is useful, as you can use that to then take a cab to other places. All in all, if we were willing to spend more money and go to a better place, we would, but otherwise, it wasn't too bad.

For a laugh you should visit the Indian nightclub on the 1st floor, its free to get in, you are made very welcome and there seems to be some kind of X Factor style dance competition amongst the very pretty indian girls there, it is loud though so one hour was enough for us but we're glad we tried it. The Arabian nightclub is 20dhms to get in so we didn't bother. Also go across the road to the Lotus Hotel for an evening or too and watch the belly dancing and the band, it is quite enjoyable. The pool bar at the top is nice and we always ended our night there, having a couple of drinks and a game of pool and the barman is adorable and very welcoming. You must do the safari excursion and the Dhow cruise, K Porte will arrange it all for you and it is well worth the money (160 dhms each for the dhow and I think approx 200 for the safari), we also went to the snow park at the Emiarates mall and it was lots of fun. We went to the Jumeirah beach (5dhms to get in) as it is a private beach and bikini wearing is allowed. K Porte Inn is a good location for the city, you do get what you pay for but the money we saved by going to this hotel meant more spending money and to be honest we only used the hotel to sleep in and get changed etc. There is so much to do in Dubai that you won't hardly use your hotel. Another nice place for an evenings drink is at the Irish village which is about a 15 min cab ride away but the drinks are quite pricey but you will find all alcoholic drinks are pricey in Dubai, we found the cheapest to be in the Lotus Hotel. K Porte also do have bus services to the beach and the city centre but we didn't use it we just got cabs. As a female I did watch everyone else the first day and all the tourists seem to be wearing clothes that covered their knees so be aware of that cos you may get looks if you go around wearing short skirts and shorts, also if you have blonde hair it seems to grab quite a few looks but its totally harmless so don't feel funny about it, its a very safe place and not once did I feel scared or worried just have respect for their culture.

We were a little anxious about the K-Porte, as we got not no response to emails seeking confirmation of the airport pick-up. But to their credit all went well: the free airport transfer was waiting for us (even for just a one-night booking), and we got courteous service at check-in, including giving us a high-floor room - where there was no problem of noise from the club at all. With a decent breakfast (with a suitably Middle Eastern / central Asian flavour) included in the modest Dh 500 price, it amounted to a good value package all round.

The staff were very friendly and always willing to help, the pool area was very nice and I felt completed relaxed there. The big downside is the music from the saxophone bar. We were on the 4th floor and could still hear the music pretty loudly, I dont really think they need to have it that loud every night till 3am!!! If you are visiting the beach would recommed Al Mazamar about 20mins away from Dubai but in a secluded area and not as busy as Jumeirah. Also the Wild Wadi water park is well worth a day out and also visiting Madinat Jumeirah to the bars and restaurants.

We waited & waited for our transport to take us to the hotel from the airport (4.00am -4.30am). By chance we heard someone mention 'K-Porte' so persuading him to take us to the hotel. We also had a long wait for our rooms & had to wait in the small reception area with no facilities for luggage or relaxing in. During the wait we were offered a complementory breakfast, kind gesture but the breakfast buffet wasn't up too much but the coffe & tea ok! We finally got our rooms which were ok but nothing special. Very small dusty balcony with a view of another balcony from across the road. The heat was unbearable & you're unable to walk anywhere. We got as far as Pizza Hut @ the bottom of the road. You require a taxi EVERYWHERE as the city is so wide spread it would be impossible to see any other way. The pool & bar area is very poor & shabby & in major need of some work. 99% of the guest are from Iran. We did feel slightly uncomfortable swimming in bikinis & relaxing around the pool due to cultural differences. The bar & night club wasn't accessible if you're a non-smoker. The male guests smoke pipes that would hurt your eyes & lungs on entering! Alcohol is in limited supply, you can get a G & T via room service @ a reasonable price but isn't sold in local supermarkets. The staff constantly try & sell you tourist trips & compete between themselves that becomes tiresome & slightly annoying.

My husband and I have travelled a lot and, by our standards, this hotel was just okay. The buffet breakfast in the mornings was fine. They served at least 4-5 hot dishes, bread (for toast), tea, and coffee every morning. We rented cars in Dubai and were able to park them downstairs (under the hotel) free of charge, which was great. While this hotel does have laundry service, they were unable to loan us an iron for us to use in your room. We tried to use their expedited laundry service but the clothes did not come back in time before we had to leave. In fact, they didn't even iron the clothes and yet they charged us for it. After our bad experience trying to get clothes ironed with the laundry service, we ended up going to Carrefour (department store) and buying one for 15 Dirhums to use in our room for the remainder of the trip. This hotel advertises that they have free WiFi internet access but during our stay, it wasn't working. The best part about this hotel is its location. It's near (about 1 block across the street) Pizza Hut, Burger King, small grocery store, small pharmacy, and a mall. The worst part about this hotel is all of the water out of the restroom faucets is SCALDING HOT! This makes it difficult to take a shower. The second worst part about this hotel is that the Saxophone night club plays loud music until at least 2 am or 3 am. Three of our hotel rooms were on the 4th floor and we could easily hear the music into the night, making it difficult for us to sleep. Our fourth room was on the 6th floor which didn't seem to have this problem. The hotel staff was not very curteous and we were unable to get them to remove the laundry (ironing) charge from the bill even though we never received our clothes ironed. We paid around $90 USD/night for double occupancy rooms. If we ever visit Dubai in the future, we would pay a little more money for a higher quality hotel.
