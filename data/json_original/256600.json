Very dangerous for 3 year olds with open balcony which caused us to have her sleep between us every night (not very relaxing). Only stairs for access into the hotel and we witnessed a number of families having to carry strollers and kids up the stairs including ourselves with two strollers.

Kitchen was dated and a number of our items were missing compared to family in another room. Dirty wash cloth found in bathroom from previous tennants and some soaps not refilled.

On that basis, the Metro On Darling gets a high rating. Corner of Sussex and King, right across the road from the Slip Inn (where Mary met Frederick, in case you know your Australian-Danish royalty), and with fantastic views over Darling Harbour towards the Pyrmont side. Also, walking distance from Cockle Bay, Kings Street Wharf, Pitt and George Streets - even The Rocks was only a 20min walk away. So with such prime location, you'd think they could throw some cash at the place and make it a little less shabby. It's not that it's really bad - just dated. The wi-fi (free, depending on how you bought your stay) requires little password slips which you need to get from Reception, and which then only work sometimes - which is annoying - and everything else just feels like it needs a lick of paint. BUT - it's a killer price for what it is, the service (including airport transfer service) is OK, and Sydney is not a place to visit if you want to stay indoors. So for the few hours per day you'll spend here, plus the great advantage of being able to do your own washing and cook some breakfasts before you head out, it's a great option for travellers who want a gorgeous view without having to hack off a limb and offer it to the money gods. Just don't set your expectations too high. If they DO renovate it, they'll probably charge twice the price (and get it). Then you'll be sorry... A final note: Pyrmont, a short 15-minute walk across Darling Harbour over the Pyrmont foot bridge, has had a major renaissance over the past couple of years and is now a FANTASTIC place to seek out dinner and drinks. A whole precinct of bars and restaurants has sprung up there, with some outstanding food much cheaper than Darling Harbour. Try Wok Station on Harris Street.

Straight across the road to kings wharf for ferry trips, 5 min walk to monorail, which takes you to paddy's markets, light rail connections, and the city. short walk to all the attractions at darling harbour. Love the loft set up so you can wake up to the views. negatives: are the steep front step to drag your cases up - especially since its an apartment & we had a couple of extra bags of food for our stay (I dont think elderly people would like it). especially since you are already taking it from the parking station down the road. The matress could have done with an update - bit saggy and the noise from the the streets. The car noises are constant and double glazing would alleviate this, (The staff says this is on the agenda for next year ). there was a drunken fight right outside at 4am one morning but i think you cant really blame the hotel for this. its proximity to a couple of popular nightclubs results in this. generally though for an apartment this close to all the attractions & the great view, I think it is worth the price they charge. We had a great stay - and whilst the room could have been maintained a bit better (cracks in the bathroom) it was clean and functional.

The laminate on the cupboards was peeling and the bath tub was stained black. The furniture was grubby and the carpet stained. At least the linen was clean. Next morning I complained to the staff and was given another room in the main building. This was an improvement but still looked very tired. Being on the 4th floor, traffic noise was less and sleep was just possible. The bathroom was in better shape but the kitchen had peeling laminate and broken cupboard door hinges.

Our 4 year old slept on the fold out couch in the tiny lounge room, which left nowhere to sit and watch tv when he was asleep.
