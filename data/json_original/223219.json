The rooms are large, clean, and nicely furnished. The staff is efficient, and pleasant enough. The parking is underground and secure, but if you have something larger than a compact car, getting into the parking spots may be a bit tricky. My major complaint is the noise from the floors above. The first time we stayed in the hotel, they gave us a top floor room, which was fine. The next three times we were on a middle floor. I can't believe that we got \"foot stompers\" above us each time, so it must be in the construction It is very noisy and was loud enough to wake me up, even with using ear plugs. This last time the person above us decided to go \"walk about\" at 3 am. The restaurant is just okay as mentioned in other reviews, but the staff was nice and I did have a very good plate of biscuits and gravy for breakfast. Overall the hotel is fine, but I'm afraid that I'll be looking for other lodgings for my next stay simply due to the noisy floors.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, reasonable parking and room rate\u201d", "Author": "trvlr7311", "ReviewID": "UR126934054", "Content": "Good location on the north edge of downtown.

In fact it didn't even meet my basic needs. Here I am at 5:30am in the morning writing my review. Choppers are flying above the city (traffic report?) and big ventilation fans outside the building are up and running. Ok, I know, I'm in Seattle. But what didn't keep me asleep was the poor quality, horribly cheap beds. I just don't understand why hotels spend big money on granite counter tops and new carpet and latest TV sets, provide different types of pillows to choose from, but would not spend top dollars on updating the most important piece of furniture in their business, THE BEDS!!!!???? Have the hotel managers ever try to spend a few nights in their own hotels to find out how good the product really is? Or simply just send 2 managers up to the rooms, lie down IN THE SAME BED and turn aroud many times as you would if you were asleep. Did the bed move and shake? Did the bed give your back a full support? With my stay here, both of these essential conditions fail. Come on! You are in the business of providing a well rested night! Being successful is not just about a fully booked hotel. You are not anything near successful if your customer like me can not get any sleep because you have cheaped out on your beds!! I have stayed in a Motel 6 for 53 dollars a night in Everett and I woke up happy and smiling. What does that tell you? DON'T CHEAP OUT ON YOU BEDS!! That should be the FIRST item on your renovation list!! Other points noted on this trip: The noise from outside is definitely noticeble. The floors are not sound proof, it sounds like a hollow wooden structure. We could clearly hear people walking above us. No thermostat/temperature control in the room. There is an old style air condition unit under the window which we didn't use this time. (might be noisy when it's on) I gave 2 stars for the \"renovation\", but I would easily give no stars consider the quality of the beds. Will not return.

I am a Priority Club member, a a fact that was not lost on the staff (it said so on my reservation). The Lobby was light and spacious and our room was very clean and modern/up-to-date with the amenities of a refrigerator, microwave and sink. Our room overlooked Dexter Avenue and although a rather busy street, it was quiet and we slept well. Being somewhat jet-lagged, we opted for the restaurant at the hotel our first night. A thoroughly pleasant surprise. The food was good, and the staff friendly and attentive. This also turned out to be just as true in the morning breakfast as well. We ordered room service after our first night here. Room service was equally timely, friendly, and the food was quite good. Located just across from the Seattle Center, it was well located for our daily excursions around town for the various sights we wanted to see. A morning walk to Queen Anne Hill got the morning started with views of the city, the Space Needle, and the Mountain (when it's out). About the parking in the underground garage...not for the timid. The compact car spaces are designed for just that...compact cars. I assume the spaces on the lower level are larger, but I never had a problem finding a space on the upper level (I was driving a compact rental car). But if you are driving a \"land-yacht,\" like the 1970's Cadillac Fleetwood I saw shoe-horned into a \"compact car\" space on the upper level, you are going to find parking a challenge. Trust me. It will be easier to have other riders wait for you in the lobby, which is easy to reach once you leave the garage.

We arrived via bus into Seattle right into the downtown. The hotel is very close to the Space Needle so we decided to take the monorail to the Space Needle (1mile) and walk to the hotel.

The younger gentleman at the front desk was actually supposed to go home and requested someone else finish our check in, but he decided to stay and make sure we got checked in ok. Very nice.

The location is A+, very close to downtown a cheap cab ride into the city or most other places downtown.

The hotel is across the street from a nice park (more about that park later) and within a few steps of a restaurant that serves pretty good food and has a bar as well. The room was clean as well as hallways and exterior grounds. There are 2 elevators that serve the hotel and parking areas, however one elevator is VERY slow and the other one is always packed with people. Parking is underground and I believe was an extra $10.00 a day, I thought about not paying the $10/day to park on the street. Needless to say after it started to get dark I realized I better pony up the $10 bucks or I might be calling the rental car company to tell them the car is stolen. Now about that park, it is a lovely little park during the day lots of trees and a small pathway, joggers, people walking around etc..etc..

I had pretty low expectations when I entered the hotel, because it was ranked 60-something here. However, when I arrived, it was pleasantly surprised. Looking at previous reviews, there are three main complaints about showers not clearing fast enough, rough neighborhood, noises from hallway. First, the showers worked perfectly, and drained really well. Second, this hotel is NOT in a bad neighborhood, rather it was a pretty safe place. There are so many hotels so close to this one (Holiday Inn Express, Loyal Inn, sixth avenue inn etc) and it is pretty safe. Also, the hotel is really close to the rest of Seattle's main attractions. Walk to Pike Place takes 15 minutes (walking is perfectly fine), because you get to walk across downtown/Westin/Macy/5th avenue and all the exciting places before arriving at your hotel. Noise from hallway can be a problem though. Pros - Free Internet - Helpful Staff - Great rooms and comfortable beds - Clean rooms - Newspaper on morning - Emerald Grill is a nice place - Short elevator waits - Close to main attractions - Attractive prices - Microwave and fridge in room Cons - Somewhat limited food options around the hotel (a 10-minute walk to 5th avenue gives you more food options) - Hallway noise, you can hear footsteps from the hallway on your floor, as well as upstairs. - Not so great views, but who cares - This freeking alarm clock!!! BEWARE!! The first night, the alarm clock rang at 4:37am!!! I was like are you kidding me! Apparently, the alarm clock rings every morning at the same time if you don't turn it off (and it is not so clear how to turn it off!) The largest button on the clock is snooze, so I pushed it because I was half asleep! turns out, it rang again in 15 minutes and so on.

Our room was fine, it was clean, everything worked, there was a decent sized fridge in the room as well as a microwave. The televisions could be updated although we didn't spend a whole lot of time watching tv. There is quite a bit of construction in the area so if your walking you need to watch out for the odd closed sidewalk etc. We walked to the hockey games both nights and felt safe as there were plenty of people coming and going from the different venues in the area. One odd thing we found with the hotel was the curtains do not close, all you could close were some very thin shears. As we were directly across from another wing of the hotel you could look directly into their rooms so turn the lights out!!!! We had to ask for a map of the area, there were no brochures in the lobby. If your staying at the Holiday Inn do not get it mixed up with the Holiday Inn Express.

Overall we were very impressed with the quality of the hotel accommodations for the price we paid. We stayed 3 nights through a Southwest Airlines vacation package so we do not know exactly how much the room was per night. Roundtrip air fare from New York, three nights, fees, and taxes came to $799.00 total for the both of us. My guess is that the room cost us about $80 a night. Check-in went very quickly. Kimberly was very friendly and gave us a two-room suite. We were only expecting an ordinary room, but that was a pleasant surprise. The room was very clean and had a living room area with a sofa as well as a bedroom. The room also came with two television sets. The bathroom was a little on the small side, but served all of our basic needs. There were plenty of towels. The shower pressure was very strong. We enjoyed all the complimentary shampoos and soaps and found them to be of a good quality. The bed was very comfortable as well and came with four pillows. The living room also had a sink, refrigerator, counter space, and a microwave. Our room also had a nice view of the Seattle skyline. The location of the hotel was not the greatest, but by being just slightly outside the downtown area, we got a good deal on the price (and so could you). If you walk just 5 minutes west you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the downtown area. You are also a 10 minute walk from the Space Needle. We felt completely safe near the hotel. Yes, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re walking in the direction of the Space Needle, there is a highway, but all you have to do is walk a block west and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at a safe pedestrian crossing. If you do not like walking, there are a number of buses that can get you to downtown and other parts of Seattle. The number 5 or 358 bus can drop you off practically right across the street from the hotel. Buses are only $1.25-$2.00 and free in most of the downtown area. We recommend taking a 194 express bus from the airport to 4th Avenue and University, walking one block west to 3rd Avenue, and taking the 5 bus to the hotel. That bus ticket will only cost you $2.00 as opposed to a $40-$50 taxi ride. There were some minor inconveniences. We did not get maid service our third day there. The made came by at 4:30 pm and I asked her to come back in 15 minutes as we were preparing to attend a Seahawks game. The maid never came back to clean the room. The hotel did not have a pool, which would have been nice. The carpets in the hotel hallways were in need of replacement and clearly showed their age. This hotel met all of our basic needs and we saved a ton of money staying here as opposed to a similar quality hotel that is a 5 minute walk closer to the downtown area. We would definitely stay here again. Marc T.

PROS: Pretty elegant lobby (as far as Holiday Inns go), incredibly polite and helpful front desk staff, clean and modern rooms, microwave and refrigerator in room, free internet in room, excellent shower pressure, restaurant on site (which I didn't try, but it looked very nice), cheap parking. CON: There is only one con, and it's only a con if you do not have a car with you during your trip. Sadly, the location of the hotel is somewhat inconvenient to downtown Seattle. It is in very close proximity to the space needle, but there is a busy highway next to the hotel, so you have to walk completely out of the way to get to a crosswalk. Overall, it is about a 10 minute walk to the space needle, which isn't too bad, but the walk to the rest of the downtown attractions requires more time and energy. For example, to walk to Pike Place Market is between 25 and 30 minutes. It helps that there is a monorail at the space needle that can take you downtown for $2 each way, but unfortunately it stops running at 11PM, so for late nights walking is your only option. However, the whole time I was there, I never felt unsafe walking around even at night, so the walking can be good if you have the energy. Overall, obviously it would have been nice to stay a hotel closer to downtown attractions, such as the Sheraton, but this hotel was also much cheaper and still had very high quality rooms and service, so I would recommend it for travelers with a car, or enough endurance for the walking.", "Date": "August 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver", "Title": "\u201cnever go back\u201d", "Author": "travelchic83", "ReviewID": "UR8240481", "Content": "I was very disappointed by the service there-the restaurant is only open for breakfast on Sun-when we wanted lunch.

Check in process was friendly and fast. Parking was only $4.50 for our stay, the garage being under the building with a key-entry door. Very safe looking and feeling once we drove in - clean too. I was happy to pay it. Elevator runs a might slow, mostly because you can't encourage the doors to shut with the button. When we got to the room, it was so incredibly clean and tidy. I was pleased. The layout was very logical, so they fit a lot in. They had given us two doubles, and a room with a fridge, microwave, separate sink and disposable plates & utensils. The fridge was nice and cold (hate when you have to turn them on to get them going). If we had stayed more than one night, this set up would have been very helpful. Our 5th floor room looked out over the King5 station, and even though we saw the helicopter leave their roof at least twice, we could barely hear it. Bathroom had everything necessary, and a note to let them know if you had forgotten anything they could provide. Again, very clean. Free internet in your room, and they'll provide the cables if you've forgotten yours at home. My only complaint was that there was no breakfast in the lobby to come down to. Not even some coffee and/or tea to take with you as you go out the door. It's not that I was promised any, that's just something I'm used to - have a glass of juice and a muffin while you get ready to head out. Oh well. Overall our stay was uneventful and very restful.

You can also hop on a bus to downtown from the 'free zone' which is only a few blocks away. The pool was small and uninviting and located in the Holiday Inn Select next door. The staff was so-so.

The hotel is within a few blocks walking distance to the Space Needle/Experience Music Project as well as the Monorail line that drops you off very close to the Public Market and Embarcadero area. We arrived a bit ahead of check in time, but the front desk staff wasted no time in identifying a room that had immediate availability. So, we were able to get situated and unpacked without delay. We parked in the hotel's underground garage (in/out privileges included, although we didn't need our car at all during our stay). Parking is $4.50 per night in the hotel garage, which was extremely reasonable for secured parking in the heart of the city! We took a stroll to the Monorail station at the base of the Space Needle and took the next train to Westlake Center Mall (there are no other stops). From there we followed the crowd to the Seattle Public Market (think fishmongers), which was a blast on a Sunday afternoon! You've also got easy access from here to an array of waterfront attractions and restaurants, although we were disappointed to discover that the IMAX theatre closed permanently only a week prior to our visit (to make room for an expansion of the aquarium). We returned to the Space Needle at about 9pm for our walk back to the hotel. It was here we experienced a little discomfort in that there seemed to be a large number of \"locals\" more or less loitering on the streets and sidewalks near the Space Needle at this time of the evening. We weren't sure if there was some kind of an event going on nearby but we were no longer among fellow tourists as we made our way back to the hotel. There was also a very large and visible police presence, which was comforting on one level but still begged the question as to the reason for it and whether it was \"routine\" for the area after dark. Regardless, we made it safely back to the hotel where we generally enjoyed a quiet overnight stay. The only complaint we had was with the occupant above us who seemed to be walking laps around his room late into the evening and early in the morning. Don't know what that was about, but certainly wasn't the hotel's fault, even though, when I mentioned it later, the desk staff said I would have been welcome to call them at the time and let them know about the noise. No comp breakfast at this hotel, but there are a few coffee shops and restaurants in the vicinity (including one at the hotel). Even though we stayed just one night, the hotel staff allowed us to continue to use the parking garage the next day while we explored the city a bit more. The total for the room, after taxes and parking, was about $170 for the night, which is a little higher than I normally like to pay. (You could also try the Holiday Inn Express located right next door). The proximity of the hotel meant I didn't have to drive in and out, which was very convenient, and the amenities were quite decent. The staff was friendly and helpful, so I would certainly recommend the Holiday Inn - Seattle to others.", "Date": "July 31, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Restaurant\u201d", "Author": "TravellerBD", "ReviewID": "UR3308549", "Content": "Well, okay, we stayed next door at the Express, but this hotel has the greatest restaurant, the Emerald Grill.

Lovely fresh scallops beautifully prepared, really fresh salad, delicious desserts. You expect this sort of cuisine at a top notch restaurant, and often don't get it.

We returned at 11:30 thinking we could now have our naps since we were dragging...no such luck. We then decided to get some lunch but the hotel restaurant was closed for lunches on weekends. So we walked about 3 blocks (few restaurants in the area) to Shilla oriental food, very tasty. After our leisurely lunch we were sure that we would be able to take our much needed snoozes....no such luck, we then parked our cabooses in the lobby and promptly all four of us passed out. The hotel staff finally came and woke us up at 2:30 to tell us that our room was now ready. Technically, rooms are not guaranteed till 3pm, so we couldn't really complain. The hotel is your standard Holiday Inn, rooms are fine, pay for parking 4.50 per day, (underground lot which is under the hotel) and all in all not a bad place to stay. It wasn't in an exciting area as there were no restaurants or shopping areas nearby, but pretty close to the Space Needle Center. A seven min ride to the harbor and Pike Place.
