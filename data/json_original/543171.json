It's basically some dodgy rooms on the top floor of a residential block. Let's start at the beginning. I spent 15 mins walking around to find the front door (a dodgy plaque is all that signifies this place). Then got into tiny shaky lift. Reception is as welcoming as the Bangkok Hilton. When the websites includes \"paintings\" as an amenity and feature, you know you're in trouble! The room wasn't clean and not welcoming. Dirty bed covers, awful TV reception and not even a glass for some water (no tea or coffee either). Bathroom stank and breakfast was a cold coffee and some pre-packed biscuity thing with peach marmalade. Avoid this place at all costs. Luckily I was only there for one night, I would've slept in the park if I had to stay another night.", "Date": "September 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Socorro New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cThe worst experience ever...\u201d", "Author": "amoviaggo", "ReviewID": "UR4400378", "Content": "Never, ever stay at this place. It was booked for my first three nights in Rome. They were over-booked, but lied and said they had electrical problems. They sent me to a dump across town without a private bath or elevator. They did not pay for the taxi ride. The next night they failed to give me a necessary key, so I was locked out until 1 a.m. No one answers any phone numbers, even emergency ones. I was able to get to my room only when another couple arrived after dinner. They helped me search for the appropriate key. After all this, this horrible B&B gave me only a 10 Euro discount, and were rude at that. It is the worst service I've ever had in my many years of travel.", "Date": "January 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cSteer WELL Clear of this Dump!\u201d", "Author": "bradshaw", "ReviewID": "UR4034421", "Content": "We recently went to Rome for a wedding and stayed in this doss-house!I nearly cried at the thought of hanging my beautiful dress for the wedding in the shabby old wardrobe! This is definitely NOT a hotel and is basically an apartment \"converted\" into a \"hotel\".

What's worse is that our travel agent booked this!We had picked a hotel in a brochure that she showed us and then she discovered that it was cheaper to book the same hotel online, so she did...however, it was not the same hotel!!

Arrived at veneto suites at our quad room, which looked lovely on the internet site.The lift had no light in. The suite was absolutely disgusting, it was cold, dirty and smelt of damp.It was raining when we arrived + there was no heaters anywhere.Within minutes of arriving we were pested for all 1,000 euros we owed for the 5 nights.We had no quilts on the beds only thin sheets, the sheets had stains on them.Underneath the beds was thick of dust and rubbish. We were given thin towels, which we had to go + ask for new ones after 2 days. The dirty wet towels from ALL residents were stored in a red linin bag in the corridor which leaked onto the floor.The \"breakfast\" consited of cold coffee + a pre packaged crossant.We all recieved some kind of insect bites. The bathroom was disgusting with no ventilation + the shower leaked all over the floor.The room and bathroom were never cleaned, so absolutely stunk.Smoking was disallowed,probably because there was no smoke detectors.Also the balcony was unsafe as it moved and the window shutters were \"plywood\".
