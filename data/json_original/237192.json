I travel frequently on business and usually select the upper range of hotels. The Nardizzi Americana is not a Marriott Resort, etc. However, it is typical of a reasonably priced hotel in a large city, very comparable to a number of hotels where I have stayed in New York City. The room was large enough, it was clean, it appeared to have been recently refinished. We had a room with a window that opened onto a courtyard and the noise level was quite acceptable. The walls are thinner than a top-flight hotel, but not to the extent that one hears every noise next door. I must say the staff was helpful and friendly, and seemed to enjoy talking to us. The breakfast was not at all bad for Italy -- they don't do American breakfasts there. There was cereal, a couple of kinds of fresh pasteries, juice, milk, and a coffee machine with several types of coffee, including American style. The breakfast was generally well stocked, even when busy. Our only complaint was that there was a light burned out in our bathroom that caused my wife some issues applying makeup and, although we asked more than once, it was never replaced. Really though, we enjoyed our stay and thought the place was pleasant and an outstanding value for a downtown hotel in a large city.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cStayed twice in last 6 months - and will stay again\u201d", "Author": "VitoOxford", "ReviewID": "UR126811915", "Content": "Excellent location - you can walk from Termini, restaurants, grocery, Borghese and on and on and on.

So I took a chance with Nardizzi. I was pleasantly surprised! The Hotel is located at the end of a steep road (via Firenze) and it is on the 4th floor of a huge building. It's within walking distance of Termini Railway Station (although I took a bus), of the Metro Station (Piazza de la Reppublica) and many bus lines. The service at check-in was excellent I didn't get the name of the receptionist but he was really helpful with all our questions, he spoke English and Spanish to us. He showed us to our room himself. Our room was big enough, and very clean. The bathroom was spacious and the beds comfortable. Take into consideration that spaces in Europe (in general) are much smaller than in America for example. The room ha a TV, and I don't remember if they had English speaking channels or not, because I was so tired when I got back at night! Who has the time to watch TV? They had free wifi to use at the reception, which was helpful. Breakfast was OK, if you want better coffee you can pay a little more, or just go down the street to a cafe. They had fresh croissants and bread with butter and jam, which I liked. One day we walked from the Hotel to Fontana di Trevi, it was not that long, and we took pictures along the way. If you want to use the buses, just go down the street and there are several buses that can take you closer to the center and to St Paul's Cathedral. Overall I had a great time, I had more than what I expected.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPotential to be good but fall's short\u201d", "Author": "charlene1873", "ReviewID": "UR124061125", "Content": "Having just returned from Rome, I am not one of these people with extremely ridiculous standards and I knew I'd booked a 2 star hotel so wasn't really expecting much however I was disappointed with the standard of room that we did get. There was several things that I'd warn about before booking. The hotel has the potential to be great as it's in a great location next to the underground, the Termini and Via National. The free breakfast was great and even the old crazy lift added character to the place. When we arrived it was a fairly simple check in process, the reception desk was helpful enough and we were taken to our room. The room was a double which in turn was 2 single beds pushed together, it faced another building across the way so there was no view. The roof had extreme dampness marks on it and the window pane of the french doors wasn't attached to the actual wood so the glass flapped about. In the summer warmer months this wouldn't have been an issue but it was January and pretty cold. The shutters over the window don't keep any of the heat in so it was a really cold room. The bathroom was fine apart from the toilet coming away from the wall everytime you sat on it and it filled the bathroom floor with toilet water which wasn't pleasant. We'd also asked for a non-smoking room but people smoking in the next room meant that we could smell all the smoke. Becase of the vents it was like they were smoking in your room. I complained about all of the issues and didn't really get anywhere as their English wasn't great, one of the desk people came in and sprayed fabreeze everywhere which just made it worse so we had to open up the windows and the room ended up freezing again. The cleaners made a fair attempt at keeping it clean but just folded up our old towels instead of replacing them and given that we stayed for 6 nights I had to ask for some new towels. I hate to moan but it just fell short and had the potential to be a wee gem if it just tightened up on attention to detail.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and comfortable room\u201d", "Author": "jezebellejade", "ReviewID": "UR123421236", "Content": "Excellent location in Rome.

Yes the lift is small but we were both able to fit into it with our two quite large bags, it did take a little shuffling around but we made it work as it beats walking up four flights of stairs. Yes the Wifi \"DID\" work in our room and it was also \"FREE\" unlike alot of other places in Europe that charge approx 3 euro per hr. Yes the rooms are small but who comes all the way to Rome to sit on the end of their bed all day?? We used the room to wash-up, sleep and somewhere to leave our bags. Our room was serviced everyday and the hotel allows you to leave your (large) key at reception, rather than having to worry about it on the street. The boys that ran the reception were awesome, were friendly and happy to have a chat with you. The showed us some good areas to eat and drink and where to spend new years. They also showed us to the nearest laundromat. The location is great, right near the main train station and just off Via Nazionale.Another great thing about the location is that we booked alot of tours as it was our first time to Rome and we were able to walk to all our pick-up areas (apart from Vatican City). the breakfast was simple but nice with a wide range of different pastries and spreads & cereals. The only thing that we found a 'con' was that there was someone smoking in the corridor or room next to us and it smelt as if they were in our room. Nothing to harp on just had to open a window (in winter) The last thing is that the City of Rome charges tourists to stay in the city. 2 euro per person per day.

My first impression was the thought of how nice and quiet to lodge here for a week. The only noise you will hear was the morning Italian opera singing from the Korean church below. Occasionally, you can hear kids running around late at night. Hey who wouldn\u2019t be excited to be in Rome? I shared the room with my friend. We had a much bigger room compared to the last hotel we stayed. Our room was at the end of the hall so we didn\u2019t encounter any loud neighbours. The Italian hotels are very simple and clean. Most hotels have marble floor so you might want to bring your own indoor slippers. The bathroom had a shower stall that was just big enough for one person. The hot water can get really hot. I really enjoyed it compared to the lack of hot water experience in Indian hotels. All Italian bathrooms have a bidet for washing your buttocks, but we used it differently. Streets in Rome have very old cobble stone and it can be very hard on your feet. The bidet was the perfect solution to relieve the soreness. Hotel didn\u2019t provide much free toiletry products. We used mostly products we brought with us. There was a heated towel rack but I don\u2019t think it was working. Maybe it\u2019s only turned on for the cold winter. The AC controller dialler was removed so you cannot control the temperature. It\u2019s all on or nothing. We slept ok under the AC. It did get a little cold at night for me but my friend didn\u2019t find it was too cold with the AC on. Our beds were two single beds pushed together. We were only given one big bed sheet and a blanket so we kept our beds pushed together by sharing the bedding. Closet space was plenty for the both of us. They provided nice wooden coat hangers. We used them mostly for our hand washed personal clothing items. The safety lock is not electronic but rather opened with an old key. It\u2019s quite small mounted into the wall. It was big enough just to fit the passport and wallet. Our section of the corridor always smelled really good. The lights were energy efficient as it was motion sensor controlled. I like that about Italian hotels. Everything is efficient and reserves energy. The complimentary breakfast was simple. They provided cereal, milk, tea, coffee and water. There were pastry but no other hot food was prepared. Would I stay again? Yes in a heart beat! Wouldn\u2019t you want to stay at a place where you feel welcomed and safe? Even the cleaning ladies were really nice and helpful. I didn\u2019t know what they were saying but they always provided what we needed on a daily basis.

We loaded all of our luggage into the elevator and took it to the fourth floor to check in. We exited the elevator, only to be met by the manger who told us to get back in the elevator with our luggage and head to the first floor. Once on the first floor, we had to schlepp our luggage up one flight of stairs to get to the \"wing\" where we would find our room. We had to buzz the front desk to get access to the \"wing\" who monitored comings and goings via a camera. Once in the \"wing\" we walked down a long hallway to the end and entered the door to our actual room. The room was a \"triple\" which is what I requested, however, the room was very, very small with dirty linens (one of the sheets had blood on it), the air conditioning did not work and the tv was mounted so far up the wall, you could barely see it. The bathroom was really not any better. The shower did not have long lasting hot water so we had to stagger showers, etc. On the 3rd floor of this old building is another hotel called Hotel Oceana. I have no idea what that was like but I would never go back. All night long, I worried about cockroaches or some other rodent crawling across my bed. If I could have clicked my heels two times and made myself disappear I would have. The reason we did not move hotels is because I booked these all through STA Travel who assured me these were great, reputable hotels.

First we stayed here because it was highly recommended in Rick Steve's book and had great location. In fact we walked with luggage to train station in 15 minutes. Let me describe what happened and you be the judge. At the hotel we took a tiny elevator to 4th floor where we checked in. We were taken down to the 1st floor, room 101 by a man who identified himself as a Palestinian and we are carrying luggage. The room stank like old mildew, it was awful smell. We tried to stay as we were exhausted from grueling 6 hour train trip and early morning rise. We then tried the bed, which was two double beds semi-connected that kept separating, making it impossible to sleep. After 2 hours we gave up and asked for another room. The same guy said no other rooms were available except a new remodeled superior room with up charge, because since we tried to sleep in the bed he wanted payment or up charge. By now I was starting to get angry as we had stayed in several hotels in Italy, all with good results. His boss told him to give us the so called upgrade room, room I think 306. The room thankfully smelled better and was slightly bigger and nicer. Now remember we are lugging our bags up and down many stairs and elevator through all this nonsense and bone tired At bedtime we tried to turn heater on as we were very cold. Heater finally came on next day after visit by the \u201cguy\u201d and his boss. Then oh goody, the shower would not make hot water and took forever for that to be corrected. Then the same shower flooded over into the unit and out into the hall way. This went on for 2 nights before they fixed all this misery. The Palestinian guy became cold towards us, unresponsive and would not look at us when we turned room key when we would leave to go out, like we were the problem. In closing there are many places to stay in Rome and I advise you to do your home work as this place is not anywhere I will ever stay when we return. I hope this helps.

It was spacious, all tile with an arched ceiling... and best of all, the shower was huge, all tile as well and had dual shower heads (one on each wall). That's right... DUAL SHOWER HEADS!

You can pretty much walk to all the touristic attractions and for those that don't like to walk there is a metro station just 2 mins from the hotel that is very easy to use . I would advise you to get a Roma pass- it cost 23 euro but that allows you to use buses and metros for 3 days, as many times as you like and you get your first 2 sightseeing places for free.

It was a very unpleasant end to a fabulous 2 1/2 stay trip in Europe. We took the train from Venice to stay overnight in Rome to catch a flight to the U.S the following morning. We stayed here because of its proximity to the Termini. First of all, it was more than the 10 minute walk claimed by Rick Steves. It was very disappointing. The rooms are strange to say the least. We had a queen bed and two twin beds. The room was ugly. The bathroom was clean, but that's about all I can say. Actually that's the only good thing I can say, is that the place was clean. The A/C was a joke. There was some air blowing around, but it was not cool AT ALL. We slept on top of the sheets. The head of the bed was lower than the foot. The TV worked sporadically, not too big a deal since we don't understand Italian, but still it should have worked. The rooftop terrace is not \"delightful\". It's just an open area with some tables. No view. The hotel is on the fourth floor of the building. They advertise a \"lift\". It's probably 100 years old and miniscule. We only had 3 pieces of luggage and once the two of us and our luggage got in we had to twist ourselves into pretzels to get the door closed (and we are small people). And it was stifling. The common areas are not air conditioned at all and it was very hot that day. We asked for water. They said they would get us some, not bothering to tell us that there was a machine in the hotel that dispensed cold water. They never specified there was a charge for the two small bottles they brought us, but there it was on the bill the next day 2 euros each. There seemed to be a lot of young (18 to 25 year olds) there. I guess it's ok for them, but still there are nicer places that are a better value out there. There is a hotel on the third floor that you have to pass on your way to the Nardizzi Americana called the Oceania also recommended by Rick Steves. We passed by and drooled. Beautiful carpets, beautiful doors to the rooms, elegant, and it looked like it was cool inside. Probably the air conditioning worked. It only cost a little more. I would take a chance there if I needed a place to stay in that area again. But it's not that close to the train station and there's really nothing much around. At the beginning of our trip we spent 3 days in Rome and stayed at the Teatropace 33 very near the Piazza Navona. It was absolutely fabulous and only cost a few dollars more than this joke of a hotel, the Nardizzi Americana. We should have gone back there. We had planned to walk back to the train station the next morning to get the airport shuttle, but it was too far so we just took a taxi which we could have done from the lovely little Teatropace 33. The Nardizza Americana also didn't give us the complete discount we had agreed to on the phone, but it wasn't worth arguing about 10 euros.

Out of all the places we stayed in Italy (Venice and Florence), this was our least favorite and the cost was similar to other places in the country. The pros of this hotel, in our opinion, were the location and the room size. The location was easy to get to from the Termini train station but also an easy walk to Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, and Colosseum. The only time we took public transportation was to Vatican City. The room was also big by European standards, with high ceilings and plenty of room to walk around the bed. The a/c also worked well in our room, although I heard several other guests at the front desk saying theirs wasn't working. The cons were pretty much everything else, specifically the staff, breakfast, and room smell. Our room was on the \"third\" level of the building - basically when we came in, we went up to the 4th floor to get our key, and then had to walk down 2 more flights of stairs to get to our room. I'm not sure how the rooms on the other levels were, but our room had a constant sewage/sulfur smell that I'm guessing is from the water in the bathroom. It was pretty pervasive and not pleasant. The room also had construction going on RIGHT outside the window, so it was impossible to leave the window open during the daytime without hearing a jackhammer. The breakfast was not the best, especially compared to other places we'd stayed. Only pastries/doughnuts and cereal. The coffee and \"juice\" were from a machine, which was disappointing considering we were in Italy. The staff overall were not particularly helpful and sometimes rude. For example, my fiance asked the staff person at the front desk if he could make a dinner reservation for us. Instead of calling the restaurant himself, he simply dialed the number and wordlessly handed the phone to my fiance. That is not service!! We were also very disappointed with how our check-out was handled. If you have a quoted rate from them, be prepared to show ALL paperwork saying that this is your rate! We had received a quote from them and had the email, but also wanted to pay in cash, which, according to the Rick Steves' book, would warrant another 10% off. The staff person told us that the cash discount only applied to the rate in Rick's book...something that is never stated anywhere. He grudgingly gave us the 15% off because we stayed 5+ nights but demanded to see where it said it in the book repeatedly. We were running to catch a train and couldn't haggle forever so we took that. Overall, you can definitely do better when in Rome. I wouldn't stay here again.

I planned to stay at Hotel Nardizzi for one night and then get out of Rome. Unfortunately, I was pickpocketed at Termini (don't feel dumb for using a money belt at Termini-I'm a very experienced traveller and I got duped) on my way to Siena. I went back to the hotel, knowing that their kind staff would allow me to use the internet and cancel my cards, etc. They were amazing! So sympathetic and kind. They allowed me to stay there that night, even though they knew at the time I had no money. They checked up on me, did what they could to help me with cancelling my Siena reservation, gave me a great rate on the room that I ended up needing for the week while waiting for replacement credit cards, and so much more. I just can't say enough about how kind the staff is at this hotel. The first night I was in the older portion of the hotel. It was clean and nice, but a little on the noisy side with a busy street not far away. In the newly renovated side, the rooms are lovely. The air conditioners rumble a little, but they drown out whatever courtyard noise there is. I'm a light sleeper and had no trouble sleeping with air con on and my earplugs. Breakfast is not gourmet, but is certainly enough to get your day started. The stairs are numerous, but that's what justified the gelato in my mind... There is an elevator, but it's old and tiny. However, before you drag your suitcase up 6 flights of beautiful marble stairs, walk straight down the hallway from the main doors and look on your left halfway down. It's not obvious where the lift is when you arrive, but it's there! Rome can wear you down-you do have to be on your guard and deal with the grit and heat and traffic. It's nice to come back to a hotel with staff who care and have your own little oasis.

Believe me, I worried about everything from location, language (we do not know a lick of Italian!), staff, breakfast, safety, leaving our room key with the front desk., buzzing in after hours.... but my boyfriend, 32 and I, 27 were truly delighted with this hotel & it\u2019s staff. In summary Hotel Nardizzi was a gem & we couldn\u2019t have asked for more perfect/safe location, clean comfortable amenities, helpful/friendly staff at such a reasonable price. If you are looking for a US style hotel, this is not it. If you have a US breakfast expectation/appetite\u2026..this is not it. And I warn you: If you are over 240lbs, 6\u2019, you most likely will NOT fit in the shower \u2026..however if you want a quaint Roman experience this place is a winner. For those of you that want more details & travel tips please read on: We booked last minute, about 10 days prior to arrival. We were able to get the best rate by booking 6 nights directly through the hotel's website [--] (~$95USD/72euro per night in Nov 08). I called the hotel the day prior to our check-in and the hotel cheerfully confirmed our reservation in fluent English...which was very comforting. I explained we'd be arriving in the AM & asked them if we could store our luggage safely until the 1pm check in time, they agreed without hesitation. We arrived at the airport early Saturday morning, around 8am. From the airport we took the Leonardo Express train to the Termini Station ($9.50USD each, at the airport train station there are ticket kiosks that accept credit cards & an ATM for easy access to Euros) we arrived at the Termini in about 35mins without any issues or concerns. (we were told to be aware of pick-pocketers in Rome, so be mindful/aware of that during your stay, although we did not experience any issues at all during our stay) We walked the 5 or so blocks from the Termini Station to the Hotel Nardizzi. Follow the directions from the Termini posted on the hotel's website as they are perfectly clear and accurate. The walk from Termini to Hotel Nardizzi took us about 20 mins, taking our time. As with most of Europe, keep in mind a lot of the are cobblestone and you will have to navigate your way through the crowds, if you choose this route make sure your luggage is manageable. It would be much longer walk if you happened to break a wheel on a 50+lb suitcase\u2026you know what I mean! When we arrived at the hotel's building I was relieved. (the hotel/hostels that are located really close to the termini are look pretty bad) Hotel Nardizzi\u2019s building was in great location on a quiet, safe street . Everything that first-time tourists want to see is within a 20 minute walk of this hotel. (more on that later) The building has a large door that is locked at night, there is a buzzer if you need to be let in after it is locked. Which upon booking I thought would be an issue (we are not used to that in the US) but the front desk is staffed 24hrs and the desk clerk was always happy/helpful no matter what time we buzzed. The ground level of the building has an Opera, 2nd floor appeared to be residences, 3rd floor Hotel Oceana (also appeared equally nice, but more expensive than Hotel Nardizzi) then you can take an awesome little Lift (or stairs) to the Hotel Nardizzi that is on the 4th floor. The lift is VERY small, I\u2019d guess easily over 100 years old but we personally thought it was sooooo neat. Again, it wouldn\u2019t be good if you have lots of luggage. We arrived at the Hotel Nardizzi about 9am and were cheerfully greeted by the front desk. We planned to just drop off our luggage at the hotel and head out adventuring in Rome until the 1pm check-in. But were delighted when the front desk clerk said they had a room for us to check into. The room we checked into was VERY small, with just enough room to walk around the double bed, a built in closet w/safe, 2 drawers and small bathroom containing a very small shower. Although small, the room and bathroom were spotless, bright & very comfortable. We threw our small luggage under the bed (really nowhere else to put them) , quickly freshened up and were enjoying Rome within an 90 mins of landing at the airport, very nice. When we returned to our room Saturday evening we could hear the singing from the Opera downstairs, it was really beautiful. The next morning we were pleasantly greeted by the Hotel Staff, and had a self-serve breakfast with a choice of cold cereal, croissants/rolls/toast (very good) and machine-dispensed coffee, coco, orange & mixed juice. The breakfast selection was so-so, mostly carbs (no protein-meat/ or eggs) but is definitely all a person needs until lunch time. The breakfast eating area is very pleasant, clean with lots of sunshine. There are also tables outside to eat and/or smoke. When leaving the hotel you must leave your room key with the front desk, which was a bit strange for us. But the keys have sensors on them & are fairly large. They would be a pain to carry around all day\u2026.and probably not cheap if you lost it & had to pay to replace it. So leaving it with the front desk is probably for the better anyway\u2026plus there is a safe in the closet for valuables. Anyhow, when we prepared to leave, the front desk clerk offered to move us to a different room. Initially we declined as we were perfectly satisfied with our cozy little room and didn\u2019t want to be an inconvenience\u2026after all we had things to do! But the front desk clerk insisted that the new room would be bigger more comfortable for our extended stay (6 nights) and there would be no additional charge, so we agreed. We quickly packed our luggage so that the staff could move us to the new room once it was cleaned & ready. That evening when we returned to the hotel the front desk clerk gave us our new room key. We were delighted, the room was nearly double the size of our initial room with a table/2 chairs and was also very clean/comfortable with our luggage waiting. During am/pm rush-hours you could hear the volume of the traffic since the window faced the street however at night it was not at all bothersome. While in Rome, if your time is limited or you don\u2019t want to walk everywhere (which you could do, if you wanted) to) . I suggest buying a bus/subway map for about 6 euros & purchasing a few tickets at one euro each. Tickets are good for a single way 75 min trip on the bus and/or subway. You can by tickets at shops/street vendors/restaurants, just ask chances are they have them. Any bus that says Termini or Barberini stations will get you back to the Hotel Nardizzi. You can hop on/off busses with the crowds of locals however always have a ticket in your wallet (unstamped) just incase you do get checked. I hear it\u2019s a $50 euro fine, payable on the spot if you get caught on the bus without a ticket. In the whole 6 days we were never asked to show our ticket or see anyone else get asked to show their ticket. What I am saying here is don\u2019t waste your money on expensive taxis or tourist passes if you don\u2019t have to. Visit http://www.rome.info/metro/ for a subway map, its only two lines therefore not that hard to master: Subway/Metro A: From the Hotel Nardizzi board the subway at Barberini or Rupublica stations you can arrive at the Spanish Steps via the Spanga station, San Petro station to see the Castle, & the Cipro station to see the Vatican within 10-15 minutes. Important: You do not need to pay for a tour to get a good seat in the Papal Audience on Wednesdays. On Wednesday morning about 7am catch the subway or a bus from the Barberini station over to the Vatican, about 10 -15 min ride. There will be staff handing out FREE paper tickets to the people lining up. About 7:30am the staff opens the gates to St Peter\u2019s square & you can get easily a seat in the first few rows, if you arrive early. However if you are like me & want to get tickets before hand, just submit a request online to the Santa Susanna church they will hold tickets for you in your name. You will need to pick them up at the Santa Susanna Church on Tuesday evening or early Wednesday morning (the Church is only 2 blocks from Hotel Nardizzi) & is very neat on the inside too. Just pick up the tickets from the table & leave a small donation for their efforts and your peace of mind. They speak fluent English if you have questions. The Cappuccin Crypt or \u201cbone chapel\u201d is beneath the Santa Maria Church (Our Lady of the Conception of the Capuchins) is only about 5 blocks from Hotel Nardizzi, near the Barberini station & Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. Very cool place, not very well known, and only requires a small donation for entry\u2026.it took us 4 days and asking about 50 people just to find it under our noses! Subway/Metro B: Coliseum: Board the subway/Metro B at Termini station, exit at the Colosseo station. (2 stops) It is worth paying for an English speaking tour to get into the Coliseums. We paid $10 each to bypass the 90minute wait, well worth it, even though the tour-guide & radios really wasn\u2019t great. Catacombs/via Appia Antica: Board the subway at Termini station, exit at the Pyramid station. Walk across the street from the station & wait by the newsstand to get on bus 118. (about 20 minute bus ride from Pyramid station, outside the Roman city walls) the driver will tell you the best place to get off the bus, just ask. We went to the Christian catacombs, it was 10 euro per person that included a mandatory English speaking guide. Make sure you visit the restaurants in Campo de Fori. Very good local food. Yes\u2026incase you were wondering we drank the tap water, ate all kinds of local food and didn\u2019t get sick. But on our 6th day we ended up craving beef landed ourselves at the Hard Rock caf\u00e9 (near Barberini station) for a good ol\u2019 juicy American burger\u2026haha. ;) Give yourself extra time to get back to the airport for your return trip. The Leonardo Express train departs every 35 minutes from the Termini station to the airport starting at 5:50am & takes 35 mins. Getting from the Train/ to the airline check in was a little tricky for us, just ask the staff..... it saves time/stress. Hopefully this helps the other first time visitors to Rome\u2026.(I sure wish a posting like this existed before I booked my trip!) ....Remember, just because you have money doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend it on things you don\u2019t have to, just to see the sights.

So, we ended up paying 102 euros cash for our last night. By big city European standards, this was a \"big\" room. It had A/C, which kinda-sorta worked. (More on that later.) It had a double bed, which you could walk all the way around, without having to turn sideways. The tv was on the wall. There was a ledge running the length of the wall opposite the bed, underwhich you could put your luggage. The ledge dropped down to desk height for about 4 feet, and there was a chair, creating a working surface. There were two corner niches by the beds, acting as night stands. No alarm clocks or phones in the rooms, but some kind of radio, with a very bright LCD light. The double bed was two twins with one sheet over them, and sagged horribly in the middle of each. The pillows were flat and hard. The sheets were coarse. One small twin blanket stretched across the width of the bed. The underside of the bedspread was stained, so I pushed that off of the bed promptly. The floors were tiled and patterned to look like wood and hadn't been swept or mopped in a while. Everything put down on the floors promptly became dirty. We could not walk barefoot in the room, even after a shower. The shower had a raised pattern of bumps on the floor for drainage that made it painful to stand in. The sink had two mirrors, as it was set in the corner of the bathroom. It had no stopper. The stopper seemed to be lying in the bidet, which didn't appear to be working. The toilet ran, and had been running for some time, based on the stains in it. No amenities other than two tiny bars of soap. No Kleenex. Housekeeping seemed to consist of emptying the trash and refolding the towels and making the bed. No washcloths, of course (this is Europe), but the face cloths were dish towels! To turn on the electricity in the room, you had to put your room key in a slot by the door. No key, no electricity - no A/C while you were gone. So, the maid would throw open the windows and let in all the bugs and humidity, so by the end of the 3rd day, those coarse sheets were unbearable to sleep in. The walls were paper thin. Someone sneezed in the next room; I said \"bless you\" and that person said \"thank you\". The hallways are tiled with a mosaic pattern down the middle, so any rolling suitcase makes a loud racket - so latecomers wake anyone sleeping. Doors open and close noisily. There is a door to the breakfast area and lobby that can be closed - we closed it to cut down on the noise since we were so close - and people kept propping it open. We probably got 4 hours' sleep our first night there. Breakfast was not good caffeine, lousy juice, spoiled milk on the 2nd day, cereal and pastries. We bought breakfast outside the hotel it was so bad. The breakfast area itself is pleasant - it opens to a courtyard below, that is, of course, undergoing construction. The hotel is on the 5th floor - tiny elevator should be used to send up the bags. We counted 144 steps from the street. There is Internet access in the lobby, but all the 20 year olds were hogging it for their life-and-death Facebook updates. I had to get up at 5 a.m. to check in for our flight back home. Staff is great when the tour guide is around. Once the tour guide left - well, suddenly their English isn't so great and they have \"deals\" for you. For example, the law in Rome is that it is a flat 40 euro rate for the taxi to the Fiumicino Airport. Front desk guy said no, I was wrong, there were surcharges for luggage, and that he had arranged a minivan for me - only 50 euros. I said no, 40 euros and that I would use the other 10 euros for breakfast. (There are no surcharges for luggage.) One of our tour group people couldn't afford to stay another night at the Nardizzi - they sent her off to a hostel that required a 2 night stay - but she didn't find that out until she got to the hostel! But the Nardizzi had successfully gotten rid of her. Last example - one of the staff was answering a question on how long it would take to walk from the hotel to Vatican City. \"15 minutes.\" Heck no, it takes 15 min. to get to the Trevi Fountain or to Santa Maria Maggiore or to Termini Train Station! It's a good 1 hour walk and that's only if the Italians in front of you are walking, not strolling. They have wine for sale to drink in the hotel, but there's a neighborhood bar/minimart just down the street with tables outside that has better quality wine for much cheaper. And no view of construction! None, and I repeat none, of the other members of our tour had a good experience in this hotel. One person wanted to get a set of wrenches to dismantle the bed frame to put the mattresses on the floor to sleep. The hairdryer died on another. We all ran out of hot water about 3 minutes into our showers. (So we learned to shower fast.) Others couldn't get the A/C to stay on. (It's on a timer - you just have to push the power button 3 times to keep it on.) Another person turned on the hairdryer and the electricity for her room and all the rooms around her cut out. All noted the bad housekeeping and poor quality of sheets and towels. All noted the terrible noise. This was a 2 star hotel. Hate to see a 1 star!

Our room lacked a safe, working shower, telephone, working t.v. and was located in the adjacent building outside the hotel. When we told the hotel staff that the basic amenities from our room were missing or not working they immediately launched into why it wasn't their fault. They took us to two dirty rooms, which guests were still using, and showed us one with a wall safe and the other with a working phone. We really didn't care at that point and just wanted them to know that our room was not ready to service customers and should be fixed. The free continental breakfast was also the worst of our trip. They put water in the milk to dilute it because we think they ran out midway through the morning. By 8:30 a.m. all of the pastries and fruit juice were gone. We brought this up to the staff and they immediately blamed it on a group of backpackers who were staying at the hotel. Again, we didn't care who was at fault, we just wanted the problem fixed.

When I pointed this out to them, they begrudgingly agreed to the lower rate, but were clearly unhappy that I had discovered this.)

The desk clerk told me to go to my room and relax and when I was ready to go see the site's to come back and he would show me. Very Rude! We were ready to start site seeing immediately because we only had limited time in Rome. He then escorted us to our room after letting us know that the Rick Steve's price we were quoted was which was 90 euro was now 120 euro for a double. The only reason we were staying at this hotel was on Rick Steve's recommendation. To park our car was another 25 euro a night. Also beware, Your room key is your power (electricity) so when you leave the A/C shuts off. So NO nice cool room to return to. It takes at least 3 hours for the room to start feeling comfortable. The towels are aweful they feel like those rough towels we use in our kitchen. But they will dry you off with some effort. Our nightmare revealed itself at 10:30pm when we returned to our room \"which was sweltering\" after a long day of walking around rome enjoying the sites. We were hot and sweaty and ready for a shower. The Shower nozzle was so dirty the water squirted everywhere but on the person trying to take a shower. Then the drain was clogged so the water overflowed onto the bathroom floor. We tried to call the desk for assistance and no answer! No problem we decided since the hotel was booked full that we would find another hotel in the morning. We felt surely who ever cleaned the shower last knew the problems with the shower head and the drain so we felt it better to move on without complaining just advising them of the need to check the rooms a little more through before placing customers in them. We advised the front desk that we would only be staying one night we told him of the problem and that it needed some attention. He then began to yell at Me and My wife telling us it was our problem and that he was going to charge us for the nights we booked. After arguing for about 30 min the conversation was going nowhere! He wanted cash and we would not give it to him, He had our American Express Card on file so eventually we had had enough and we took our luggage and left. I went to get the car while my wife waited for me by the curb. About 5 minutes later while my wife was waiting for me the Clerk came down from the 4th floor tried to take her purse, She resisted and was very scared. He then grabbed her suitcase and took it. When I returned my wife was distrought to say the least and at this point I started looking for the police. I had no luck finding one so I returned to the hotel and saw my wifes suitcase in the lobby. I walked up grabbed it and the clerk ran around and tried to rip it out of my hands. We now were in a tug of war in the lobby with people watching onward. It was a very unnerving and a lot of drama. All of it which was totally uncalled for and could have been resolved without incident had the clerk appologized for our inconvience and understood we were the customer and we had a bad experience at his hotel and were moving on. No need for the verbal abuse he put me and my wife through. It was a scary situation to be in also being in a foreign country. It was the first time I didn't feel safe on our month long trip to Europe! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone ever. The management needs a lesson on anger management.
