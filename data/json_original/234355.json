{"Reviews": [{"Content": "More than a great deal in Florence! After spending a week in the Tuscan countryside with friends, I wanted to stay an extra week in Florence to do some holiday shopping and relax without breaking the bank. I chose Hotel Benvenuti because it offered a nice location, free wireless, and had good reviews. Hotel Benvenuti is a two star hotel, and it truly exceeded my expectations. I had a single room with private bath, a big window, tv, heating and air conditioning. The room was very clean, simple, and cozy. I really liked the towels which are super big and lightweight. Breakfast was included in the daily rate of 30 euros per night. It is served from 7:30-9:30 am and includes cereal, yogurt, breads, juice, coffee and tea. The breakfast room is bright and cheery. A lending library is right outside the breakfast room with travel guides, novels and other books to read.Hotel Benvenuti also offers promotional packages that include dinner! I enjoyed the dinner on my last night it was great!Dinner consisted of four courses and wine!I had onion and bacon quiche for anti pasta, penne pasta with tomato sauce, braised pork steak with black olives and a side of spinach. Dessert was cantucini with vinsanto..a delightful cookie that you dip in the wine. This was the deal of the week, believe me! Check their website for special rates.The Italian/English speaking reception is always open and were very helpful with directions, restaurant recommendations, etc.A great restaurant nearby is TITO, just one block away!They have a great lunch for 10 euro which included choice of anti pasta, fish/meat and potato dish, bread, wine and water. I also had two fantastic dinners there...a great place to savor the famous traditional florentine steak with all the Tuscan trimmings!The bus stops right in front of the hotel and can take you anywhere you want to go, but you can easily walk from the hotel.I hope to come back to Hotel Benvenuti. I had an authentic Italian experience and the staff was wonderful!", "Date": "Dec 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR379317417", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "TLauck"}, {"Content": "Decent budget hotel Stayed at this hotel in July 2008. The hotel is good for budget travellers. It is clean and our room was a decent size (even if the ensuite room was a bit on the small side). From the main street you enter the building and it feels like you are in the wrong place because there are steps immediately in front of you. The hotel itself starts on the 3rd floor. Everyone at the hotel was nice and the breakfast was decent enough. There is a bit of road traffic if you are facing the street althougth it didn't keep us awake.The hotel is a 10-15 minute walk from the Duomo in the centre of Florence and we found it to be an excellent base for all site seeing in the city.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR851823264", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Bolton_Boy_8"}, {"Content": "hidden gem just returned from this hidden gem. lovley room, very clean, window closed with no problem. loads of hot water. breakfast very good. even had a lovley cup of tea with milk. the hotel is family run and went out of ther way to help nothing is too much trouble. the hotel is a good 15 min walk in to town. taxi 10 euro.", "Date": "May 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR118747177", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "evalinka"}, {"Content": "Nice place, cordial people, good breakfast I stayed here 3-20  21, 2008. EVERYBODY there was very cordial, friendly, welcoming, and pleasant for me to talk to-even though all I know is English and I am in their home country of Italy. The room was quite clean as were the linens and kept so daily. The room was generally quiet and the windows closed fine and the heat was kept optimal throughout my stay (it was about 45 degrees F when I was there). I paid for a room with a shared shower down the hall. The shower was kept real clean, was roomy and modern. The room itself had both a sink and bidet which surprised me. The rooms are bright and straightforward. The rate was attractive for this area (walk 10 blocks and pay three times as much) and breakfast was included which was quite nice. Plus you are just a couple of blocks +/- from San Marco Piazza - which has an amazing church and museum (San Marco) and also close to the museum that houses the original David statue (was it by Michaelagenlo?!..). I would recommend the place without hesitation. I did not see any problem with the lift. The reception is on the second or third floor, which by the way is pretty common for Florence.", "Date": "Mar 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR315975014", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "lariat2000"}, {"Content": "Great for a budget hotel We got this hotel for a good rate and it far surpassed our expectations. The room we (a family of 3) were in was large with high ceilings; sheets were cotton and clean; there was effective air conditioning. Breakfast was Continental - including an expresso rather than American coffee if desired - and served with a smile. Staff were friendly and helpful. Via Cavour feeds straight into the central Duomo area, though the hotel is a 10 minute walk along the street. Our criteria were a decent, clean and safe place to sleep near the centre of Florence.

Having spent approximately 30 nights at this budget hotel between March 2006 and March 2007, I am quite familiar with this place, and therefore I feel compelled to debunk the previous reviewer's objections, which I will do so in the order they were presented: -The lift/elevator that the previous reviewer described as unsafe is no different than many others across the country; I suspect it's small size is what made the aforementioned author (irrationally) proclaim it to be dangerous.-The rooms in this hotel are of average size for accommodations in this price range. They are indeed quite spartan, but again; this is a budget hotel.-The beds in the dorm-style rooms on the second floor are a little rough (they are fine if you're only sleeping on them for a night or two), but the beds on the first floor are perfectly comfortable. Also, and this point is very important; LIKE THE REST OF THE ESTABLISHMENT, THE BEDS ARE CLEAN AND THE LINENS ARE WASHED DAILY, AND NO SMOKING IS ALLOWED INDOORS.- I have never had any difficulty closing or locking any of the windows; I can not understand how the previous reviewer was foiled by this task.-The showers work perfectly well (and have an ample supply of hot water), and do not leak if one simply draws closed the shower curtains.-Room rates are actually quite reasonable when compared to other establishments in the area (this hotel is in a *prime* location; but a few minutes' walk from l'Academia, the duomo, Piazza San Marco, and et cetera). Though just like everything else in Italy, prices here do go up after Easter.-Increasing the value of the room rates is the free breakfast which is included with the room rates; coffee, tea, cow's milk, orange juice, croissants and bread rolls (butter and fruit preserves), cold cuts, and the odd piece of fruit.The hotel is family-owned; aging mama  papa take care of the kitchen duties, their adult children work the front desk and an forth, and hired maids take care of the housekeeping duties. The staff are all friendly and helpful, especially Giuliana who is a dear. :) All the staff speaks English to some extent (ranging from Giuliana who is fluent, to her parents who can manage a few basic greetings). On the few instances when I had any sort of problem (like needing an extra blanket, or the light bulb in the bathroom burning out), they remedied the situation quickly and without hassle.As I stated above, Hotel Venvenuti is a budget hotel; as such, the quality is not on par with places like the aforementioned Savoy (where one will pay at least several hundred Euro per night). But while the establishment is starting to show it's age, it is perfectly comfortable. And because it is such a critical consideration, I can not stress this point enough: THE ESTABLISHMENT IS KEPT VERY CLEAN AND TIDY, AND HAS NO HYGIENE PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER.As a budget hotel, this is an excellent establishment. For anyone who is seeking basic (but comfortable) accommodations in a convenient location, and for a competitive price, I strongly recommend Hotel Benvenuti.(DISCLAIMER: Aside from being a repeat customer (due to my high satisfaction with the establishment), I have no connection to, or relationship with this business or it's owners/managers whatsoever. I have written this lengthy and detailed review simply because the owners are very kind, they run a respectable business, and I do not wish to see their hotel misrepresented, especially in a negative manner.)", "Date": "Mar 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR299573939", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "OneWhoTravelsMuch"}, {"Content": "terrible room I travelled to Florence in March of this year as an art student in part of a group.I expected basic accomodation but was horrified at the state of the rooms and hotel for the price we paid.On arrival you have to carry your bags up four flights of steep stairs because the lift is compleatly unsafe.We were stuffed in to the small rooms. Sleeping on uncomfortable cots with stained and ripped bedclothes. The rooms were freezing at night because the windows dont close properly.The bathroom was a joke,a tiny room slightly raised from the corner of the bedroom, and when you attempted to shower the water streamed across the floor by the toilet bowl and out under the beds.
