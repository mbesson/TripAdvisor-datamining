{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Overpriced and ugly, nice location. I have no idea why this hotel is so highly rated by previous guests. The room that we got is definitely overdue for an update - furnishings that I think went out of style in the 70's (and not the good stuff from the 70's either..), a toilet tank that needed to be messed with to get it to fill, very low hot water pressure in the sink. For the $68 + tax that I payed to stay at this place, I have stayed in 3 star hotels in mid-town Manhattan during Labor Day weekend no less. The location of this hotel is good, and most of the staff is generally helpful (although unresponsive about the toilet complaint), but boy this place needs help. Anyhting over $40 is way too much for this place.", "Date": "Dec 8, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR584062761", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "great place We booked four rooms here. the staff is terrific. They met our every need, spoiled our children terribly and generally treated us as though we were the most important thing they had to take care of. They booked a tour driver for us who was terrific, organized our bus trip to Acapulco, and even opened the restaurant up early to get us fed before heading us on our way. It's an easy walk to the zona rosa from here, and a VIps and McDonald's are a block away (as well as a pharmacy and small supermarket.) I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a clean, quiet, friendly place to stay.", "Date": "Jul 15, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR820409289", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d169822-r1510666-Mision_Park_Plaza_Mexico-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "169822", "Price": "$65"}}
