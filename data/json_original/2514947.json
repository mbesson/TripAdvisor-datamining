Wonderful breakfast and very friendly staff. We would wholeheartedly recommend this property if we had not been mislead, not once but twice, when we asked for assistance at the front desk. The first occasion we were on our way out to buy a bottle of wine for our room and we asked where a nearby store might be.to purchase wine. The clerk said that the hotel had wine, and before we could ask another question he went to the back and returned with a bottle of red - uncorked, with two glasses on a tray - and announced that it would be 30 EUROs. We were embarrassed at the misunderstanding so asked that it be added to our bill, but did feel uncomfortable that we were now buying a bottle of wine that we had not asked for or chosen. The second incident occurred when we asked if a taxi could be called the next morning for our return to the airport. The hotel offered a car and driver service for a flat rate of 75 EURO, which we declined because it would be a Sunday morning, and a regular taxi would be half the cost. The next morning, when we asked if the taxi had been called we were told yes, and the driver assisted us with our bags to the taxi. Five minutes into the drive to the airport we realized this was not a regular taxi, but the hotel's car service and we were once again feeling manipulated into paying more for something we did not ask for (in the case of the taxi, we had specifically said NO to their car/driver service, but were now finding ourselves trapped). I am very disappointed to share these stories but these incidents left a negative feeling of the hotel for us and marred what would otherwise have been a perfect choice of hotel. Hopefully others will learn from our mistakes and gullibility.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201cWonderful breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "seam_by_seam", "ReviewID": "UR118438752", "Content": "Overall, my stay at Hotel Nicolo was great.

I hurt my foot very badly the first night in Paris, and the staff called a doctor for me in the (early!!) morning when I woke up in pain, and was very kind to me in my distress. The breakfast is really wonderful - croissants, baugettes, yogurt, lots of different fruit, other pastries, eggs, etc. More than enough to fill you up for a day of sightseeing (or lazing about in a cafe sipping wine!) in Paris. They do not have many tables for breakfast though, so I would try to beat the rush by coming down early! But it's nice to sit with a fellow traveler and have a nice chat too, sometimes! The rooms are beautifully decorated, and the beds very comfortable. The rooms are very small though, so keep this in mind. My bathroom was tiny, but I didn't care so much. I never woke up because of any noise, but I am a very heavy sleeper. I especially loved the small garden in the courtyard. It is also in a great area - a grocery store is just down the road, along with an ATM and a pharmacy. I would recommend this hotel to nearly anyone.

Excellent proximity for a visit to the Eiffel Tower. Just a 10-15mins walk to Passy or Trocadero Metro stations for easy access to the rest of the city. Some shops and restaurants (including trusty McDonalds with its free wi-fi) within easy walking distance. The area in general felt quite safe, although when coming home from Trocadero late on sat night I did catch a taxi. I was all prepared to walk but the souvenir guys suggested it was better not to walk by myself (me being a youngish female). Hotel is inviting with its lovely garden and courtyard. My room was on the 2nd floor, overlooking the courtyard. Whilst not a massive room, it is decorated tastefully and is very welcoming. No minibar or air-conditioning, but is equipped with a TV (loads of French TV), ceiling fan, safe. It is nice and quiet, and exceptionally clean. Lovely queen size bed for a single room. Private bathroom was on the small and functional side, but workable nonetheless. Not much room in the toilet alcove (if you\u2019re a taller person your knees may touch the wall in front!). No screen on the shower entrance but for me that didn\u2019t cause excessive water on the floor. Lovely selection of toiletries provided. Being a central location in Paris, some rooms are located in close proximity to each other, the stairwell or the lift. I did hear some muffled noise during the night, but nothing significant. The only reason I have mentioned it is for the very light sleepers (and I would use ear plugs rather than find somewhere else though!). No noise was audible from outside of the hotel - lovely for such a central location! Continental b/fast was included in my room rate (Single room promo rate of \u20ac85 per night). Selection of seasonal fruits, pastries, yoghurts and cereals, in addition to being served individually with my own croissants, breadsticks, jams and tea/coffee. Certainly an ample breakfast to start the day (although not the selection of meats and cheeses you may be used to at other hotels). The Hotel does offer a limited selection of drinks as well. Finally, service provided by Hotel Nicol staff was excellent, and always available on the 24hour reception desk. Joseph was very willing to provide advice on how to maximise my stay, and with a touch of Parisian humour too! Marc helped me out with further advice on the Metro, etc. The hotel will happily store your bags for you as well. The housekeeping and serving staff were always polite and went about their business quietly, with no fuss. To sum up \u2013 for easy access to Eiffel Tower (I took some marvellous night time photos) and surrounding areas, Hotel Nicol is a clean, comfortable and easy choice to stay in Paris.

It's located near two subways stations, a few stores and a small shopping mall with a supermarket; the area itself is good, and we felt comfortable and safe. The breakfast was ok, but there was nothing special about it like I read in other comments. You get good quality bread, butter, jams and cheese; no ham or hot food. The rooms are small, but not to small and are OK by Paris standards; they are clean, so that's a big plus. You do have a little elevator but we thought it charming and had no problem on going up a few stairs. The staff is friendly and the internet access is good (Wi-fi), although it's not free, it's only 3 euros for the length of your stay. The negative was just the bathroom, it's very small and there is no shower curtain, so, although this might not seem a problem at first, the fact is that the bathroom floor gets wet and the door of the bathroom is damaged because of it. You have a safety deposit box, but no refrigerator. All in all it was a good stay, but sadly I cannot compare it to other hotels in Paris, since I don't know any. I just think that the price, around 150 euros a night in early June, might be a little expensive for the amenities you get, but, on the other hand it's a good clean room and nothing really wrong about it, so why risk staying in another hotel with negative comments?", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cSplendid location, customer care and enjoyed everything about this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "LePotier", "ReviewID": "UR115122296", "Content": "Stayed from 6-28 till 7-6.

Also, Susan's on Rue d'annuciation (sp?) serves Great Tex-Mex (i am from texas and can assure this is good). Ask anyone about the location, she's been there a long time. Room- I stayed in a single. Comfortable bed and chair, desk and drawers all more than sufficent for a longer stay than mine (8 nights). Good lighting in room and ceiling fan, no A/C but that was Ok because the weather was great when I stayed. Shower/sink/toilet keep spotless, suggest a shower curtain though for splash. Room with safe and ample shelves and hangers. 3euro for WIFI during entire stay, not per day. Computer in lobby available too. Desk staff. From the minute I arrived, everyone of the people I dealt with was very helpful and quite friendly. When I had specific questions on places to visit, I was handed printouts of their search results. When I had a ticket to print, was able to email it to desk and it was printed within 3 minutes. Clouette (i think that is her name) was cheerful and as an intern in the business has a great future. They have a genuine concern for your comfort and satisfaction, no doubt. Food- Yes the breakfast was great, ample breads, fresh fruit, Great coffee, cereals, youghurt, pasteries, juices. Eat in the courtyard, quiet oasis of flowers and plants. Can't complain about any aspect of my stay, even the PetitJean (small elevator) only big enough for me and my bag or a couple very much in love.

(the 3rd bed was a pull out sofa bed, but my sister said she was comfortable enough on it.) The tiny lift gave us the giggles, especially as you still have to drag your suitcase up or down a few steps anyway as it's on a mezzanine level, but it was fine. The continental breakfast was much better than we were expecting with a choice of drinks, juices, bread, croissants, fruit, youghurts, muffins, flans and more. We had half hour of internet useage which cost 5 euros. I don't know if that's par for the course, but I didn't feel ripped off. I loved the surrounding area, and we had lunch near the hotel both days. Turn right out of Rue Nicolo onto Rue de Passy, past the Galerie Passy Plaza (small shopping centre) to the Rue de l'Annonciation. Nice brasserie at the end there (lunch day 1), but wander down that street and it's full of market-type shops where you can fill up with chocolate, wines, bread, meat etc. Loved it there! Had lunch on day 2 in a small place that does crepes & galettes. Delicious. If you're coming from Gare du Nord or Gare de L'Est, I would heartily recommend taking the bus over the metro. We took the metro to the hotel and quickly got fed up with the number of steps everywhere, carrying suitcases. On the way back, we caught the #32 bus which stops virtually opposite the Rue Nicolo and goes to the Gare de l'Est via some great tourist sites! I guess it's not far to walk from there to Gare du Nord, but we just got off when we noticed the bus stops were shared with the #43 which DOES go to the Gare du Nord.

Entry into the hotel courtyard, the reception, and four nights later my view is that there is nowhere else I would want to stay in Paris.

The room was very clean, artwork on the walls, artisian type furniture, writing desk, lots of draw space, mirrored wardrobe, safe, bathroom with bath/shower, a bed the size of Manchester, the result of two beds pushed together, and double doors overlooking the courtyard.

Only people in the courtyard or hallways could be heard within our room and these instances were minimal. * Up-to-date bathroom facilities within the rooms. We stayed in a Junior Suite which was comfortable for space: seperate sitting area, antique desk for lap-top set up, king size bed. * Staff was friendly and helpful; especially Katherine who tends the front desk during the day. She is fluent in English and very accommodating in arranging for guests' needs. * Breakfast is standard continental fare: croissants, baguettes, jam, butter, tea / coffee, pastries, custards & fruit. Particularly enjoyed the plum cake in the AM. * There is a cozy and beautiful courtyard to enjoy breakfast or snacks available for the guests. Unfortunately it was cold and rainy our entire stay so we were not able to indulge. * Fairly good selection of restaurants and shops in the immediate vicinity. Take the time to explore the back streets in the areas. We found some real gems for places to eat; within reasonable budgets. Several Fran Prix and other food stores were close by for grabbing cheese, snacks, wine, etc. Plenty of pharmacies and other shops in the area. * Felt completely safe walking about in this locale. * Only charged 3 Euros for internet access; in total for a 4 night stay. Best rate I encountered for internet access during 2 weeks travel in Europe. Connectivity was good. Dislikes (relatively minor issues): * No shower curtain around the tub.

The rooms are nicely decorated and look out over a beautiful courtyard, the breakfasts are generous and filling, the hotel feels clean and safe, and the staff radiates an attitude of being there to make sure guests are comfortable and worry-free.

Wifi is also available to guests at a reasonable price, although I'd suggest to the hotel that it offer wifi service free to guests- the price is so low that it would probably be of more value to the hotel to be able to advertise that it has free wifi for guests. Not a complaint, just a suggestion to encourage the success of an an establishment that I hope will be successful for a long time. The location is near-perfect. Within easy walking distance of several Metro and RER stops, it is located in a pleasant, bustling neighborhood.

We thought everybody was going to be like him. we were traveling with a 4year old and we got in early around 6am. It was our first time in europe, so we were very excited as you can imagine. As soon as we got off from the shuttle, we were happy to see a nice charming little hotel wth a beautiful garden. But when we stepped inside, the guy at the desk greeted us with a frown and just asked for our papers.. When I handed it to him, he asked me why they didn't include the child and became argumantative. I hated to have to deal with that with a very sleepy child in my arms.
