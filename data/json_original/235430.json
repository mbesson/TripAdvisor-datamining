I chose this hotel based on location and price. I was traveling solo without a car, and needed to be near a metro stop because I had to get to downtown the next morning. While this isn't my favorite area of LA (Santa Monica is), I am familiar and comfortable with it and preferred to stay here rather than downtown. I read reviews before I showed up and have to say that I had no problems with the hotel at all. I stayed in a King room, which was quite large, and more importantly, clean. Fancy and modern it was not, but I didn't expect that, and don't require it. I will agree with the other reviews that the room was quite dark, but I don't see this as a problem unless you're planning on reading alot in the room. The bed was super comfy and I didn't want to get up in the morning. The room price included breakfast, which was adequate for my needs as well. Nothing fancy: juice, coffee, donuts, bagels, and you can make waffles. I put too much batter in the pan and made a mess--the girl who was working there was very nice about it :) I will also add that the front desk staff were also very pleasant. I didn't use the pool. It is very small and clearly is not meant for swimming but rather for taking a dip if you're hot, which I was tempted to do because the temperature when I was there was 100F! Now, if I had a car and had to pay to park, I would be unhappy about that, BUT if you don't have a car, the location is very good. It is a couple of blocks from the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Grumann's Theatre and all the kookiness of Hollywood Boulevard, which you will want to at least see and say you did it.

Manager eventually allowed us to have a room at 12:30pm. Bad smell in hotel even worse in my non smoking room. Room had an odor of old cigars and mold.

We paid $6 per day for parking. The problem is that they sell parking spaces to the Hollywood Bowl patrons, too. One night when we came back, we were asked to park our large van in a compact space between a wall and a large SUV. This was a challenge when we had just a few inches clearance! When we complained, they denied they sold parking to others, but there is a sign right at the entrance that says \"Hollywood Bowl Parking $25\". The hallway ceiling outside our room had some major leaks. They had four buckets in the hallway to catch the water. Throughout the weekend, the air conditioner in the hallway was off, so it was hot, muggy, and smelly in the hallway. The hotel advertises wireless internet, but I couldn't get my laptop to connect. When I inquired at the front desk, I was told the wireless service was only available in the tiny lobby next to the front desk. Rather than deal with that, I ended up connecting to the Best Western wireless service across the street. The pool is the smallest hotel pool I've ever seen and it is not heated. It is sandwiched between the elevator and the buildings with no room or sun to lay out. The continental breakfast is okay - cereal, toast, doughnuts, bagels, fruit juice. Watch out for the vending machines - I spent $2 on a bottled water that never came out. Our bathroom sink was slow and backed up while we brushed our teeth or shaved. But we didn't want to complain because we had already been to the front desk too many times and feared repercussions while away from our room. This hotel is in a good area if you want to walk to the sights on Hollywood Boulevard (it's about a half mile walk). But the sidewalks are not well-maintained, so be careful. There is a mini-market and Starbucks one building over from the hotel that is convenient. During most of the day and evening, it is near impossible to make a left-hand turn out of the parking lot, so plan accordingly.", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cAtrocious\u201d", "Author": "t0moko", "ReviewID": "UR7349727", "Content": "A true hole.

We first arrived at the hotel on our stay of seven nights only to find that the electricity was out in the area. According to a lady who was checking out as we were arriving, this had been the second straight day of this. Hotels right down the street were okay and their electricity was still on. The girl at the front desk said she anticipated things would be okay shortly so we decided to park our vehicle and walk down to Hollywood which was only 5 or 6 blocks away from the hotel and grab something to eat. We figured we'd call back later to see if it was on yet. We ate and during this time I called a couple of hotels out of the area to see if they had rooms which they did. We were simply using this as an \"if needed\" possibility at this point. We felt good once we called back to the Comfort Inn & Suites and the girl at the front desk said the electricity was back on and all was well. We began our walk back to the hotel and it was just about dusk. As we began our walk back, things just didn't feel safe the farther we got from Hollywood -- now again we are only talking a few blocks here. There were rough looking kids and adults hanging out on the street corners and if front of the stores on the way to the hotel. My family just didn't feel safe as we were walking back to say the least. Once we got back the girl at the front desk did not have a computer to show her what room to put us in. She had a written list that she was using to go by. We received a room key and proceeded to get our luggage out and put on a cart to go up the elevator. As we got to our room we put the key card in and opened the door only to find out that this room was already occupied!!! There was luggage and clothes all over the place and the beds were unmade. The occupants of this room were not present. However, if this could happen to them why would we be immune from something like this occuring to us. Fortunately, for the people whose room this was we are honest and forth-right people so we didn't even think about doing anything other than shutting the door and going back to take the keys to the front desk. You talk about a shock this was it. As my husband went down to the front desk to get another room, a gentlemen whose family was staying across the hall said he would stay with me and my daughter because it wasn't safe for a woman and a child to be out in the hallway alone at this time of night. My husband decided on the way down to call the hotel we had inquired about while we were waiting for the electricity to come back on. He went ahead and complained to the girl at the front desk and she really didn't know what room she had available anyway. He told her that if she would just cancel our reservation it would be in everybody's best interests as she was very frustrated that she couldn't come up with a room for us. The only good thing about this hotel is that our reservation ended up being cancelled and we didn't have to pay for ANY nights at this \"DUMP\".

Swimming pools, movie stars and GULP, cockroaches?! Before I get into this review, let me take the blame for having to stay in this hotel.

Not for the fear of the possible skunk, but I think their might be some sort of bugs and cockroaches player's ball going on under there. I think they are discussing how to eat me. This is not my first stay at the Comfort Inn Hollywood, but be assured it is my last. The first time seemed like a charm, but in retrospect, it was the experience I had OUTSIDE of the hotel that was charming. On this second stay here, words cannot describe how unpleasant this place-- (Hold on a sec. I bought some Lysol disinfectant that I need to spray immediately.) So, anyway, I had a coupon for this place, but it was not accepted. That sucks, but the other places around here don't have rooms available, so, I pay the regular price. Plus parking (they didn't charge for parking last time I was here!). So, I come up to my room, room 202 if you're reading this Comfort Inn folks, and I walk down the hall immediately greeted by guys I thought I was gonna have to fight. It was like an old west showdown, with me being Gene Wilder but drunk off lack of sleep, not booze. I'm just out here for a meeting or two, now I might have to get into some gangsta-ish? Happily, this ain't the movies so there was no static. But then, I open the door to room 202... It smelled like roadkill wrapped in terrycloth. But at this point, having only slept from 3am - 4am central, and it's 1:00 pacific (you do the math, I'm still too sleepy) and not to mention, starving, I hope cracking the window would get rid of this repugnant scent. It didn't. And no time to complain, I have a meeting soon. By the time I get back, I think I could have slept in a refinery I'm so tired. I wake up, crack the window then head down to the \"free\" breakfast. As I'm eating my donut (which was pretty good!) and drinking my OJ I glance around the room. And their they were. BIG FRIGGIN' ROGER CORMAN MOVIE ROACHES! I'm a nice dude, so I go to the front desk and say, you know, there are roaches in your breakfast area. And, I kid you not, the woman shrugged all apathetic like \"So?\" Then I said \"You don't care that you have roaches crawling around were people eat?\" Her reply \"I'll let maintenace know.\" You ever have a friend where you say \"I'll talk to you later\" but you're not really going to be talking to them later? That's how she said it. My recommedation: If you enjoy repugnant scents and cockroaches for breakfast, please, stay at the Comfort Inn in Hollywood.

Beyond the parking , the place was a good deal.It was just a 1 mintue drive to highway 101", "Date": "March 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGreat service & location, just a few issues...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3261520", "Content": "Stay Dates: March 5-8, 2005 The location of this hotel is great. A short walk to Hollywood and Highland where Kodak Theater is. Very close to Hwy 101 and the Hollywood Bowl. The employees that we talked to were friendly and helpful as far as getting information about attractions. We had to call the hotel for directions several times after we arrived at LAX because we kept getting lost. The man at the desk was very helpful and patient. It was a 2 hour trip to the hotel from LAX (we got lost and had bad traffic). Going back to LAX in the early morning took 25 minutes. The room was clean and good-sized. It had a refrigerator and microwave. However, I had called a few days before our arrival to see if they had free high-speed internet. I was assured that they did. Unfortunately, they do not. Another problem was that they never refilled our supply of soap or shampoo during our 4 day stay. With 3 of us in the room, we went through these items quickly. Also, all the vending machines were out of order the entire time we were there. Having the fridge in the room helps because you can pick up something to drink while you are out and about and save it for later. I would definetly suggest bringing your own beverages since I have read other reviews that indicated the vending machines were out of order during their stay. Overall, I would recommed this hotel. The price, location and friendly service make up for the minor problems that we experienced.", "Date": "March 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, NSW, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "davidnew", "ReviewID": "UR3105761", "Content": "I stayed here for four nights 26-30 January 2005 after receiving suggestions from the TripAdvisor forums. As other people have commented, it all looks new, the rooms are spacious, the windows can be opened to let in fresh air (too rare in most motels), the room I had was away from the road so there was little traffic noise, the staff were friendly and mostly helpful, the booking via the Internet was smooth and trouble-free, the bed was comfortable, a refrigerator and microwave were provided, and 90+ channels of cable TV were provided (although most of the time there was still nothing worth watching :-). There is a free continental breakfast, although I did not partake. The location is very convenient, close to Hollywood Boulevard and the Metro Red Line subway. With a Metro Day pass ($3), you can get almost anywhere on a bus or the subway. I went to Disneyland for the cost of a day pass plus $1 each way, although this can take around two hours, so leave early. As for safety, the hotel requires use of your room key to use the elevator, so corridor access is restricted. Highland Ave is very well lit at night, and there are always lots of cars going by. I did not feel at all threatened walking back to the hotel by myself as late at 11pm. After dark, there were a few homeless people/beggars, but they were mostly targetting people in cars stopped at the traffic lights. Most never spoke to me, and if they did, I shook my head and they went away. The only thing that prevents me from giving this hotel a rating of 5 is that the walls and ceilings are very thin. Conversations and amorous couples in adjacent rooms on some nights were clearly audible. The worst was when, at 4:45am, something started in the room above that sounded like children playing games, jumping up and down on the floor, running around, and turning the TV volume up. This was still going on after 9am. I did ring the front desk at 6am, and they said they would see what they could do. However, it did not stop. The noises from adjacent rooms were not really a problem, and the noisy children are hopefully an isolated event. Overall, I was very impressed, and would certainly stay there again.", "Date": "February 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWould stay here again\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3020219", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location, just a short walk to the Hollywood Bowl and Hollywood Blvd. Highway 101 is one minute north.

You can walk to the subway and Hollywood Blvd. It's just a block over. Sunset Strip, Hollywood High School, and Mann's Theater are all a couple of blocks away. Universal Studies is a short ride away like 5 minutes. The lobby is small and so is the pool. So if your looking for a hotel with many bells....this is not the one.

When we were checking out, the manager (named Raj) asked us if we were going to call a cab to the airport. When we confirmed that, he told us that he could get us a shuttle for $15 dlls each (we were two people). The manager told us that we should pay to him $5.00 dlls each of us, and that we should pay the rest to the shuttle driver. The shuttle arrived on time, asked us for the rest of the money and then picked another guest from the hotel that is just crossing the street (Hallyday Inn). Later, he told us that his car was failing. He didn't ask our opinion, but he stopped at the cab service in the Renaissance Hotel garage. There he spoke with a guy and told us he had fixed that his friend will take us to the airport on his cab. Without more explanations, he begun to move our luggage to the cab's trunk, and ask us rudely to step down. We moved into the other car, and after 2 or 3 miles, the cab driver told us that we should pay $5.00 dlls each (just the Mexicans, he said) or leave the car. We told him we had arranged the service from the hotel, and that it was already paid in full. He repeated that we should step down, or pay another $5.00 each of us. We paid him, because if we stepped down, we would lose the other $30.00 dlls. TRAVERLERS, BE AWARE OF THE KIND OF SERVICE THAT YOU COULD GET AT THIS PLACE.
