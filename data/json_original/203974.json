Unfortunately, the triple did not have the lovely view of the grounds that the double had. In fact, it had no view but did have a nice balcony. The room was large, clean and comfortable with plenty of storage. The bath too was large with a good shower and plenty of towels. One thing I noted throughout Italy was the standard hair dryers provided in all of the hotels in which we stayed; they were, without a doubt, the worst I have ever used. The breakfast at the hotel was very nice \u9225?standard continental. The one drawback was the lack of restaurants nearby.

We did a booking through their website and got a special offer 4x3. We appreciated that.The hotel was 15 minutes far from piazza michelangiolo and same distance to santa croce church. Also nice church is san miniato al monte near piazza michelangiolo. We reccomend this to everyone. From there you have the wonderful view of Florence in front of you.The hotel is a very nice villa with a nice garden from behind. The hotel villa liberty had a private parking, the only thing we had to leave the keys at the front desk.The room was too spacious, furnished with liberty style. We also found a well- working air conditioning. That is very important when you go somewhere and it is too hot.The breakfast type was continental. There was various choices; salumi, cheese, different types of briosches , fresh fruits, american coffee etc. The staff was very helpful and they were very polite. Rare thing to find the staff paying attention to you when you do the check-in or ask for some information. We had a nice stay in Florence and I think the nicest hotel we could find there.

Next door to the bus stop an excellent deli where you can enjoy quality food and wine for a few euros while you sit and salivate over the wonderful selection. The hotel rooms are comfortable traditional art deco style - very clean with a good bathroom  powerful shower. The breakfast is adequate to get you going of a morning. The hotel staff speak good English and are helpful. The hotel is in a nice resedential area - quiet at night (very safe). The 109 euro per night for a couple incl. breakfast seems reasonable compared to hotels in the city. I would not recommend staying near the main railway station if you are in Florence for a few days - too noisey and too many people. All in all I would recommend the hotel - Florence is a walkable city. Take a half day trip to Fiesole for wonderful views of the city - there is a regular service bus No.7 from the centre. General costs of food/drink are as per the UK if not pricier - certainly in the tourist trap areas. If you veer of down side streets your Euro will go a lot further.

Coffee was available, but only if the woman serving would acknowledge you. She seemed to only be interested in serving the business men. The front desk offered some dining recommendations.The Gigi Trattoria was a nice family restaurant (within walking distance) with authentic Italian food. We enjoyed dinner there the first night.

The bathroom was completely tiled, which was also a nice old fashioned touch. There was a heat wave when we were there in late May, and the air conditioner did not work. When we called downstairs, they said the government has to issue the okay to turn it on! Well, not much can be done in that situation.On waking up and going in to their breakfast room, my husband and I were shocked that an ederly gentlemen that doubled as the front desk clerk, had blarring disco music piped into the room!
