In any hotel, the mini bar should be re-stocked and changed immediately when the room is prepared for the next guest. The hallways seem to have a musty or mold smell to them despite this being a relatively new hotel. The conference rooms are located in the dark floors of -1. They have mold issues down there as one person who has a mold allergy had to be taken to hospital. The food in the restaurant is nothing near 5 star. The food is closer to 2 star. Even I could cook better than their main chef. The only thing that is 5 star in the restaurant are the prices. The staff in the restaurant are very nice. The hotel itself is 5KMs outside of the centre of Barcelona. If you are looking for a real 5 star hotel consider the W. It is right on the waterfront.

The shower was large and very powerful, and the little complimentary toiletry bottles were welcomed- we we're even given mouthwash! We had a view looking onto the Avenue Diagonal, and due to being so high up we had some beautiful views accross Barcelona. Sky bar is within the hotel in the lobby and the staff made me a couple of delicious cocktails, complete with a decorational strawberry. The hotel was a 5 minute walk from the Poblenou metro (yellow line) which goes straight to the harbour area where most of the restaurants and bars are. It's also round the corner from the Pere IV tram stop which links to other mainline metro routes. Though it's not walking distance to the beach, you'll find yourself getting public transport anyway as the metro is so quick and handy to get from a to b.

When we were checking in we were railroaded into upgrading to a superior room which we were under the impression we already were however with it being our anniversary hubby wanted the best.

TIP: The rooms are small -- I would definitely recommend getting an upgrade as the standard room is only ok.

Instead, it is about a 5 min. walk + 10 min. metro ride away from downtown. To take the metro is fairly simple but you have to learn how to use the different tickets, lines.

The main bar in the lobby is gorgeous and great for a drink before you venture out.

In July we noticed that the service was poor and not at the level of the 5 stars hotel. But the hotel was beautiful and well situated, so we decided to come back. Actually, we had several problems in July and even more this week end( October). In July we stayed at 13th floor and the water was awfully cold all the time, it was impossible to take a shower, I'm not even talking about the bath. The water in the swimming pool was cold too, but when it is hot, it's not such a big problem. The room service took 3 hours. Once we could not enter the swimming pool floor because of the so called private party, we just did not understand why we cannot use the amenities we pay for. As it wAs indicated by someone, there are a lot of strange girls in the lobbies ( we even thought they were prostitutes because of their outfit). But we lved the design of the hotel and it's situation not far from the sea and far from las ramblas. So, we come back in October. As for the first time we came with a little dog of two kilos. It is important to highlight that in July we did not have any problem because of the dog. At the same time they charge the dog's stay 50 euros a day, so, normally there should not be any problems. But this time, while having our breakfast the second day of our stay, we were aggressively told to go out to eat on the terrass with our dog (the first day nobody told us nothing). When I told the manager, that we are staying for the second time and the previous time we could eat with our dog, he said that it was a mistake (a mistake which lasted 4 days however). And he also told me in a very aggressive manner that I should be happy that they accept my dog. He probably forgot that it costed 50 euros (It's the first hotel where we were obliged to pay a supplement for the dog ). I would not bother you with details, I just want to conclude that this is not a dog friendly hotel, not a 5 star hotel and I certainly chose somewhere else to stay in Barcelona NeXT Time.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cAwesome hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jane B", "ReviewID": "UR119086790", "Content": "Just got back from Barcelona and we LOVED this hotel.

The best way into town from the hotel is via metro, Poblenou station has the yellow line which goes via all the best spots in barca. We particularly liked Port de Olympica and Barceloneta best at night, and all the touristy stuff in the day (la ramblas, passiege de gracia for shopping, parc guell and sagrada familia cathedral etc). The hotel is a 29 story high rise building and is quite striking from the ground. when we arrved the lady on reception was really friendly and helped us with directions and gave us some recomendations etc. we actually ended up agreeing with pretty much everything she said! The hotel It has a roof top pool on the 6th flr with a bar, sunbeds and little booths to sleep and relax in. word of warning, the cocktails will blow your head off and cost about 10 euros each!! we didnt use the restaurants although we heard they were supposed to be good. All in all this hotel is a really good choice, we had an amazing time and although its a little out of town we actually found this to be a real positive! Lastly - if you decide to use the \"love me tender\" pack they provide..FYI - ITS NOT COMPLIMENTRY, ITS ACTUALLY 30 euroes !!!!!!! total rip off for whats inside (trust me)..", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOUTSTANDING HOTEL!!!\u201d", "Author": "Kate V", "ReviewID": "UR116703924", "Content": "Last week we stayed at ME Barcelona and we spent some days in this beautiful city and we had a an amazing stay.

We got a very good deal on an Easyjet flight and a room on \"The Level\" with lastminute.com. My overall impression is that Me Barcelona ranks as a good 4*, but not a 5*, hotel. However, the price we paid was extrremely fair so this should not be seen as a complaint. The location is about 3 miles NE of the city centre, but there are very good bus routes (7, 40, 42) which take you to the centre in about 15-20 mins depending on traffic. The 40 is particularly useful as it goes to the Port Vell harbour as well as the back of El Corte Ingles in the centre which is great for shopping plus a stroll down the Ramblas. The T4 tram stops right outside the hotel which works well for the Olympic harbour / Estacio de Franca in one direction, and St Adria Renfe rail station in the other which connects to Costa Maresme beaches. Barcelona's public transport is possibly the best in Europe. There is a useful shopping centre at Glories 10 minutes walk up Diagonal Mar which includes Spanish chain stores and a Carrefour hypermarket. The local city beaches are 15-20 minutes walk away down the Rambla de Poble Nou which is a really nice walk along a local tree-lined shopping street with locals out for coffee/lunch/dinner at numerous street cafes with few tourists about. There is a Mercadona supermarket along this street about 5 mins from the hotel which is useful for mineral water, picnic items etc. The hotel itself had a good atmosphere with lots of young intelligent student intern staff only too pleased to help, and to practise their English! The balance between this group and more experienced staff felt not quite right, but should not be viewed as a problem unless you are really particular about a certain type of service. Our room was small but intimate. Room servicing was below the standard expected. We had to request a toilet clean on arrival, replacement of coffee / soap / shower gel several times, and our requested daily newspaper was a bit \"hit & miss\". Minbar items should be avoided as prices are extortionate. Don't even think about opening the surprise box on top of the fridge! I would recommend a room on \"The Level\". The Level lounge was another place aside from the room for comfort & privacy. Drinks and snacks were included and saved a lot of money if we had to pay for everything in the bar.Sometimes there was enough to replace lunch / dinner but not always We had two dinners in the Sky Restaurant on the ground floor (not the more expensive Dos Cielos restaurant|). Service was excellent, especially from the wine waiter, and prices were very reasonable for the quality, even given the poor Pound : Euro exchange rate. Overall, I'd recommend this hotel.

They have two restaurants at the ME: The restaurant on the ground floor was a disappointment; the waiter we had was a complete disaster, and the Crema Catalana dessert, which should be the pride of any Catalan chef, was nothing short of a natural disaster!

This does not sound terribly important but in a five star hotel it is UNACCEPTABLE! This hotel does not truly offer in room internet. Because during the day it is so slow it is impossible to get work done without going to the business center. When I asked the front desk about this, they boldface lied (which I initially believed) and blamed it on the internet company. We kept being promised that it should be fixed by the \"end of the day\". It was not until our third day there that one front desk person FINALLY ADMITTED that their internet is ALWAYS LIKE THAT and that the internet is better at nite because less people use it. i do not appreciate being lied to particularly in a PURPORTED FIVE STAR HOTEL! I booked this hotel for my HONEYMOON through an online booking site. First, when I called to confirm, the front desk staff (after being transfered to two people first) told me although they did not find it on their computer, there should be no problem at check in. Now I was a little concerned that a five star hotel was having trouble access our reservation but ok.... We arrived at 11pm. Reservation still not showing up at the computer. Front desk tells me they need to contact the internet site which they say is not responding. Well after flying from Sevilla to Barcelona after experiencing a two hour delay, i was getting very annoyed at this process. Sensing my annoyance, this pleasant young front desk person said with my confirmation page they will gladly put me in a room although I should check with the front desk in the morning to make sure the hotel finds my prepaid reservation and I don't get charged. Well twice I had to go to the front desk over the next two days to confirm our prepaid reservation, until someone finally admitted that there internet is awful so they cannot confirm with the booking site online (which is the only way they tried up until then) but they finally did over the phone. why in a five star hotel, did they put us through that? I also need to mention the three person line every time we had to go to the front desk! As a previous reviewer mentioned this hotel has potential but has issues with execution. eg-bartender taking literally 10 minutes to prepare each coctail (not good when there's a full bar of people), front desk staff well trained to be smiling but not necessarily knowledgeable about different types of restaurants (high end versus local; spanish vs. other types of cuisine); i should mention the absolute professionalism and courtesy of Luis Miguel (sorry not sure of Miguel); He was honest. apologized profusely because I kept having to confirm our reservation and gave very knowledgeable recommemdations about restaurants and travel tips to outside areas.

The staff was more than friendly - the porter basically ran after us to make sure we had a map, sent us to a small 'Ramblas' area close to the hotel with lots of restaurants and shops.

We were very fortunate to be able to have booked a suite and nothing at all disappointed, from the spectacular views of the city to the high quality furnishings and extras provided. All the electronics are Sony, Philips etc. and the bathroom complimentaries are all high quality brands.

Usually stay 5 star when travelling with girlfriends and for this break was looking for a hotel with a nice pool and within easy access to the beaches however took a punt on last minute.com secret room to avoid the high costs for the last room available in the city. Pros: Allowed us to check very early as turned up at 11:30am when first check in should have been 3pm. Very friendly and took us to the room on the 6th floor with view of building site but no big deal as wasn\u2019t here to sit in the room but on the beach or in caf\u00e9 bar. Area not anywhere near city centre or on the coast is actually in a nice quiet spot. 10-15 minute walk down one of the long streets to the beach (left hand bay) and on the back streets loads of local style shops and small cafes. Also you can connect to the metro or tourist bus close by. More of local feel and miles from the tourist trap of La Rambla. Note there is another Rambla near to the hotel which is lovely. Easy to find as it\u2019s a very high tower. Cons: Very small room with too much in it. They appeared to have seen some of the good ideas in other hotels and just tried to chuck them all in to a very small space. No larger American would even fit in the toilet, there was a 4 foot long sun bed under the TV so you couldn\u2019t lie on it or sit on. Joint taps in bathroom but no room to pass each other. But most importantly as there was no window or balcony and as neither the fan nor Air Con was working in this tiny room it was reached 27 degrees for most of the time we where in there. I called the reception 4 times about this and also had to call about hot water. It was noticed both worked in a fashion directly after call but never satisfactory. The pool area and sun terrace is a bit of a joke while a good idea in principle there are no good views here and the pool is freezing/tiny while the whole area around it is claustrophobic.

Poblenou (literally New Town); is a beautiful quiet suburb in the 22@ region - here old meets new; old Catalan soul with some amazing local architecture and parks; also the Glories shopping mall only 10 minuted walk. The rooms in this hotel are quality rather than quantity. I have seen bigger but everything is done well from the lovely cashmere bedding to the kitsch desk and wall print. Oh and when it comes to room service, the food is AMAZING :) I am a huge fan of Jamon Iberico and 22 euros got me a very generous portion (Jamon Iberico costs around 95 euros per kilo to buy from the market). The thing that sets this hotel aside from any 5 star hotel I have stayed in is the quality of staff. What amazing amazing people to start each day with. I had a problem with the heating in my room and the team could not do enough for me eventually changing my room all together. The girl on reception Elena showed me to a new room and made sure everything was to my satisfaction. The local knowledge of the staff is also invaluable with loads of advice on what to do and what not to do.

The problem was that the Lounge was being renovated during August (summer high season no less - why not do it in Nov or Feb?) which would have normally been fine if we had of been told; however we weren't until we checked in. I wasn't particularly happy as I had told my wife we had Level access and we were looking forward to it. I just thought it was sloppy that we weren't told (I would have simply reserved a 'normal' room for less). The problem was that the service issues didn't end there. I had pre-ordered flowers (at a cost of EUR50) to be inside our room on arrival for my wife. I received an email confirmation the day prior to departure assuring me that this was organised. Upon arrival - no flowers. This annoyed me as I wanted it to be a surprise for my wife. Final issue was with the errors around the laundry. As part of The Level you are allowed three articles of clothing laundered on arrival. I had to request this service three separate times from the front desk before it was done - by then the dinner where I needed my shirt had passed. All of these issues were 'remedied' by a free drink or some chocolates, but I feel that a hotel of this quality should be able to get it right the first time. We didn't have these problems the previous years and I can't help but feel that this hotel is going downhill. Barca has a variety of 5-star hotels and I think we'll try somewhere else on our next trip there. As an aside, the food at Dos Cielos upstairs was great. The Sommelier was very friendly and knowledgeable and the view was outstanding. Go there whether you stay here or not.

Every time I called room service or reception, I was greeted with \"Hello Mr. Davis, anything is possible! How can I help you?\" I thought at first it was just a greeting but the staff really stood by that statement - which included some really weird requests from me after partying long nights in Barcelona! The hotel's location is in walking distance of a lot of the sites we wanted to see - including La Sagrada Familia and the Torre Agbar (the bullet-shaped building). They actually come by to clean the room or see if you needed anything TWICE a day - cleanliness was definitely no issue here. As impressive as the hotel is, you'll be even more amazed by the staff. Everyone of them was engaging and pleasant to speak with. This hotel could definitely teach a lot of hotels about customer service.

The pool deck was AMAZING, very chic and fab, the room was very modern and the hotel itself was very chic. There was a downside though - the service. I've stayed at several five star hotels and this hotel does not have a five-star service at all. At check-in we had to ask for our luggage to be brought up to the room, which is something that shocked me since I never had to ask for the hotel staff to take my luggage. Part of the staff was rude, had bad english while others, especially at the restaurant were amazing and very kind. The hotel location can be an advantage to some and a disadvantage to others. We were a bit afraid it would be too far from the beach but it wasnt! It was just a ten minute walk to the beach and the hotel was situated in the most beautiful area of barcelona - poble nou. It's such a soulful and beautiful area, we prefered it a hundred times over ramblas and the touristic areas of Barcelona. If you want to explore Barcelona, this would'nt really be the place for it since it's not in the touristic areas, but theres a bus that stops right outside the hotel (and metro) that takes you to Las Ramblas in like 15 minutes. Taxi's are fairly cheap - around 8 euro from the hotel to the more central areas. As you would expect from any five-star hotel everything at the hotel in terms of food and drinks is a bit pricey. Water is 5 euros and the club sandwhich (which is great btw) is around 20 euros. There's a gas station like 100 meters from the hotel where you can buy water and there's even a LIDL five minute walk from the hotel. I recommend you to take breakfast at the hotel since it's very yummy. It's not an enormous buffet, but it's fairly large, and there's even champagne at the breakfast! ;D Overall we loved this hotel because of it's chicness and the fact that there's music everywhere is perfect!", "Date": "October 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cImpressive but lacks the finishing touches\u201d", "Author": "KLHA", "ReviewID": "UR81581799", "Content": "For my first time in Barcelona, the ME hotel was a lovely place to stay.

Didn't get to experience the spa or pool but it does look lovely, so I'm sure it would be a great place to kick back and chill. The rooms were a good size, clean, with a funky interior. Great views over the city or to the sea if you are above the 7th floor. Our room unfortunately had a few problems, light wouldn't work in the bathroom, and ipod dock wouldn't function either. This should have been easily fixed, however even after asking, and the staff promising to have it fixed or send someone to the room, are constant requests seemed to be ignored. Also, as we arrived late on a friday evening around 11.30, we were hungry and wanted food. Unfortunately the hotel restaurant wasn't open so we had to order room service. The after midnight menu was very limited, and considering it's a 4* hotel, the food presentation left a lot to be desired, and was definitely overpriced. In terms of location, the hotel is in Poble Nou, which seemed to be a quiet area, though it was in walking distance (10 min) walk from the nearest metro station and the local Rambla del Poble Nou, which had a great buzz with shops and restaurants. It is also walking distance from the Sagrada Familia. All in all a great trip in an above average hotel.

Breakfast is a very pleasant affair, and great staff. Staff is one of the strengths of this hotel, very friendly and pleasant, with only a few with a certain attitude: staff are obviously chosen for their youth and a certain look that matches the hotel ambience, and usually they have the spanish friendliness and charm. Again, only few exceptions to this. Room service quite overpriced and food choices at swimming pool bar quite limited. But for a weekend away they are quite enough. Swimming pool is a very nice area, pleasant and relaxing. Even when full, it is never noisy. Wonderful afternoons there.

Unfortunately, few of these amenities or vibes were present on our visit. The pool deck was just plain sad, with few lounging chairs, a tiny pool, and pathetic, abused palm trees wilting in the sun. The spa was closed (apparently for good). The nightclub, \"Angels and Kings\", was also closed. The lobby bar was barely staffed and the \"cool vibe\" of the hotel decor was sadly undone by a most unusual moldy or chemical smell emanating from seemingly everywhere at once. The moment you entered the lobby the smell hit you and stayed in your nostrils. So odd. And so disturbing. The location of the hotel is not very good for exploring the city on foot, seeing as it is out of the loop by a long shot.

The reason being is, what I liked, I really liked, but what I didn't like disappointed us quite a bit. First, the good. We had stayed in the ME Madrid and really enjoyed our time, so we figured we'd try the ME Barcelona. We were attending the Primavera Sound 2010 festival and this hotel was pretty close to the festival site, so it worked out. The hotel is very modern, what we expected. It's elegant, beautiful structure from the outside. Inside is just as impressive. Once in the room, we found it to be very nice and in terms of size, very good. Overall, it was what I'd expect; modern, stylish, sophisticated. Now, the bad. We stayed on a weekend. Be warned; this hotel is basically a club on the weekends and it is extremely noisy. We were staying on the 7th floor, facing the sea. Upon returning from the festival about about 2 in the morning, we found our room absolutely intolerable in terms of noise. I can't stress enough how loud the club on the 6th floor is. Honestly, anyone staying on the sea-view side of this hotel that is within a few floors of the 6th, good luck getting to sleep. It is obnoxiously loud. So, in our very tired states...again, it's 2 in the am...we had to drag ourselves down the the lobby, then move ourselves to a new room. We selected a non sea view room, even though that's what we had paid foor and booked. Upon checking out, we still ended up paying for a sea view room, which I'm pretty sure has a premium on it in terms of cost. No deduction was made for our room not being a sea view, nor for our having to change rooms in the middle of the night.

We had to go to the lobby to use our phones for email etc. A minor inconvenience though.

We were here for a business convention and on first look, the hotel and the rooms look great - until you try to utilise them. The hotel is a taxi ride to any tourist areas of Barcelona or a 30 min walk. There is a decent area about 8 mins walk for restaurants but this is NOT a city centre hotel. The rooms are attempting to be model and minimalist but end up being unfunctional and uncomfortable. Here's my room issues: 1. No kettle/coffee maker in the room. Virtually unheard of in a hotel of it's \"class\". 2. Cement floor in room, slippery when wet and cold. Carpets, wood, whatever ... not this cheap alternative. 3. Chair at desk is not a work station chair but a cheap, \"trendy\" plastic design - not good. 4. Impossible to shower without getting the bathroom floor drenched. 5. The wrap around curtain on 2 walls ... whose idea was this? Only one wall is window but the curtain covers both and is VERY slow on it's automatic open/close. Furthermore, it didn't close all the way and left a 3 inch gap for the light to stream in at 6am. 6. There is a control panel for all the lights and AC. Each button pressed done something different, each time. Everybody I spoke to had this problem. 7 Outrageously priced mini-bar and room service (18Euro for a hamburger) and as your miles from anyway, it's a good weight loss hotel! Beds were good, TV was ok, other bathroom facilities good - and their maid service is some of the best I've seen. Other problems. Bar staff are worthless. People waiting to be served, while 2 of them stocked and cleaned, 1 served - very slowly. 5euro for a 330ml glass of tap beer is twice the price of anywhere we drank. Outside the elevators on every floor smelled of toilets - probably because the rooms toilets backed onto that area. Poor ventilation? Breakfast is a very generous 11am finish except at weekends when it's even better at 12noon. Arriving at 11.05 on a Saturday, we were told it was finished. Questioning why, \"because we have to set up for a lunch meeting in this room\". Even though we told her the note in the room said 12, when we checked in we were told 12 - she said there is nothing she could do, even though we could see a full buffet breakfast table and people eating. It was only after demanding a manager that another staff member made a call and let us in - it should not have came to this. Smokers - forget it if it rains, there is no area even remotely or partially covered outside! Overall, this hotel just failed.

Room The room was very modern and although small (standard city view) was kept Immaculate and was very clean. We had no problems and everything worked fine. The bed was very comfy and the pillows were nice and fluffy. The room was well lit apart from the main mirror area in the bath room which was dark preventing my girlfriend from doing her hair and make up properly. The shower was spacious and enclosed and very stylish. The rooms safe was easy to use and big enough for (laptop, camera, documents, DVD player and all valuables). The toilet area was sectioned off from the main bathroom and was clean well lit and had a heated towel rail and storage space. Our toilet in room 1007 did not flush that well but we had no other problems. The tv was nice although be careful when you check your room tab as it is misleading and you could end up ordering a movie channel at 25 euros. There was plenty of wardrobe space although no iron or ironing board in room which was one of the featurers which should have been included. There was also a mini bar available which was extortionate 7euros for a small water, 15 euros for condoms - you get the idea. Dining The sky bar restaurant was very good and had a reasonable selection of food available as with most hotels I have stayed in the quality of food is average and overpriced. We did not eat in the main restaurant as neither me or my partner could pick even one dish which we liked. I feel it was a shame as the view on the terrace at night would have been amazing. The average price for one dish was 40 euros so was very expensive. I would like to point out that drinks in the hotel are expensive and as there is no complimentary water included in your room a trip to the lidl 3 mins from the hotel is a good idea. I hate getting ripped off and refuse to pay 7 euros!!. Room service I would advise against it. Me and my partner both ordered the fettucine and sun dried tomato pasta and 45 mins later and 56 euros lighter our meal arrived stone cold and minus the tomato. A quick call to reception and 10 mins later the guy came to collect it as he did he took a call (from chef mayby??) to ask what the problem is. It was obvious he thought we were making it up and being funny but at those prices the food should have been checked before it left the restaurant. The hotel did apologise although when we received the pasta it was warm but still not great. We had no problems with dining at the sky restaurant and the breakfast although expensive at 22 euros did offer an excellent selection of fruit, cereal, bacon, eggs, sausages, ham, cheeses, tea & coffee, pastries and fruit juices. The only bad experiences we had were the room service and the refusal of an extended checkout. We could use the spas shower facilities though and they look after your suit cases in a room. I would reccommend this hotel though as the staff are very friendly and speak good English.

The view was OK apart from the construction site mentioned in previous reviews. The guy at the front of the hotel was very helpful and enthusiastic, always offered to help with directions and our luggages.

He told us to get the metro to Urquinaona and get the connecting train at Catalunya station (a much quicker way according to him) which was WRONG!

Once we got off the L2 at Passeig de Gracia the ordeal to transfer to the L4 yellow line was a twenty minute nightmare, even the security guards gave us bad directions, we finally made to the yellow line through trial and error and many, many stairs. The yellow line ride was much better, air-conditioned with good signage. we exited the Poblenou staition and walked a quick ten minutes north to the hotel. THE HOTEL- Let me first start off by saying my wife is very particular about the hotels we stay-in she wants immaculate conditions especially when it comes to cleanliness and the ME delivered that and more. First the good, Check in was good young lady (I forget her name) with blond hair was friendly and helpful, the room, although smallest, was very clean, modern,and well appointed, the electronic curtain and different lighting selections were awesome and the view of the city was fantastic with the exception of the very near construction sites. The bed is very comfortable, the pillows extremely fluffy and soft and the overall design of the room with the see through bathroom vanity glass/partition over looking the bed very trendy and sleek.The shower area is very spacious with sensitive controls for water temp and toilet area was neat and partitioned off from the rest of the bathroom. Now the not so good, there was no concierge on duty when we arrived (7PM local Sunday) so we couldn't get a good idea where to eat or go to relax. We were told we had wireless in our room but we didn't (they gave us an ethernet cable so we plugged in instead).The hotel restaurant food was hit and miss, my chicken and vegetable dish was delectable however my wife's pasta and shrimp (recommended by waiter) was below par with only three small shrimp and not much pasta, my wife eats small portions but this was ridiculous.

The hotel is a 10-minute walk from the Metro and a 15-minute walk from the beach. It will cost approx. 45 Euros to get to the hotel by taxi. I would strongly suggest that you take the train. This is what you need to do: From terminal two you need to take follow the signs for the Renfe Train. You will need to walk across a bridge to the train station. Purchase a T-10 ticket. This is a little less than 8 Euros and can be used by more than one person. (If you\u2019re traveling with more than one person you can run the T-10 ticket for one person in your party, let them go through and then run the ticket for you and then go through the glass door. MAKE SURE you enter your ticket into the correct turnstile, otherwise you may purchase a train trip for someone else.) There are machines to purchase the tickets at the train station. I would suggest that as soon as you get off the plane to get money from the ATM. You will get the best rate using the ATM machine. Take out as much money as you think you will need for the time you will be in Spain. My bank only charges me one fee for the one transaction. If you use the ATM several times you back will charge you each time you pull out money. The exchange rates at the hotel and at the money exchange businesses are expensive. There is no ATM at the train station, therefore make sure you have at least 10 Euros to buy your T-10 ticket. Get the Renfe Train Schedule. The security guard will have a copy or you can ask for one from a Renfe attendant. The train runs every 30 minutes. I would suggest that you walk al the way down the platform to avoid the congestion of people. Take the train to the Passeig de Garcia station. Once you get to Passeig de Garcia, take the metro Yellow Line (L4) in the direction of La Pau. Your stop for the hotel will be Poble Nou. Please note that there are several flights of stairs in the Metro \u2013 and no elevators, and very few escalators \u2013 so I would recommend you pack light. Once you exit Poble Nou and come out to the street you will need walk straight and then make left on Lope de Vega. Once you walk for about 5 minutes you will see the hotel. Right before you get to the hotel you will see a gas station. You may want to buy a gallon of water there. Water in the hotel is expensive. Note: If you head the other way Lope de Vega you will end up at the beach. (FYI: Once you get to the beach, go to the beach on the right. If you go to the beach to left you will be on a nudist beach.) On the way back to Airport the Renfe Train will say Airport on the front of the train. Do not take any other train. Tipping \u2013 I talked to several of the locals and every one of them said that tipping is not necessary in Spain. They told me that the most that they do is round up. As an example we had a dinner check in the amount 118 Euros and the locals suggested that I leave 120 or 125 Euros. They stated that locals do not tip at all for a drink. I stopped leaving tips after being in Barcelona for two days and I did not feel as if I was treated any differently. I would strongly suggest that you get on the Barcelona Bus Turistic. This is a bus tour that takes you to different sights around Barcelona. It costs 21 Euros for a one-day pass and 27 Euros for a two-day pass. I would suggest that you buy the two-day pass because there is a lot to see and you will need to get off the bus to see all of them. You can purchase one of these bus passes in Paca de Catalunya. You can get here by going back to the Metro and taking the L4 (yellow line) to Urqinaona. The last thing I that I would strongly suggest that you do is to take the 30 minute train ride to Sitges. You will need to take the L4 (yellow line) to Passeig de Garcia. (Note that you can also catch the train at Estacio de Sants, but I would not suggest it. Sants is a very busy station. If you get on the train at Passeig de Garcia you will be on the train one stop before Sants and this will insure that you will get the seats you need before the mad rush of people get on the train at Sants.) The final destination of the train is either Vilanova i la Geltru or St. Vincen\u00e7 de Calders \u2013 these are the names that you should be searching for on departure boards and on the front of the train rather than Sitges. There are a lot of gay men in Stiges, but the beaches are great and the village has tons of shops and restaurants. All the beaches have toppless women. Approx. 1 out of 6 women don\u2019t wear a top. This includes grandmothers. The metro/train is a great way to save money while visiting Spain. Take a few minutes to review the maps of the subway, and if you can read a map and follow signs you\u2019ll be just fine. Magic Fountains \u2013 a must. I have seen the fountains at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. I prefer the fountains in Barcelona. At 9 p.m. each night you view a spectacular show of water, lights and music. Finally, a couple blocks from the hotel is a street called Ramba del Poble Nou. The locals walk up and down this street and eat dinner at the sidewalk cafes. Note that most restaurants open at 7:30 p.m. and close at midnight. Before you leave for Barcelona make sure that you take a look at www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com You will find a lot of good information on this website.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cAwfull hotel\u201d", "Author": "IrelandPenney", "ReviewID": "UR38510455", "Content": "We were booked into the ME for 9 nights, we checked out after 3, staff were very unfriendly and unhelpfull. the rooms are among the smallest Ive ever stayed in.

The hotel is ultra swish and actually found the location to be about right. It will cost you 35 Euros from the airport, and will take approx 25 mins.

All mod cons and everything you will need (No Iron) There is so much to do in the hotel like (Spa, Pool, Restaurant, Gym, Night Club on Saturday) We walked to the beach on the first day and did not realise how long the becahs was so settled in a nice spot which was busy but really nice. Food can be expensive but generally it is the drinks. Nice though. the one thing I would be wary of is the cost of drinks in the hotel A coke 5 Euros and vodka and Tonica 10 Euro's in the end I walked to the petrol station (1 minute walk) and bought water and cokes etc from there. Breakfast is 22 Euro's each. Very steap for what it is. More positives is the pool area. Lovely chilled pool enough beds as long as you get down about 9am and put your bag or one of their towels down. Food by the pool is lovely Service is lovely (always with a smile) Manged to get a check out at 2pm We went to two amazing restaurants: Ciutat Comtal (Rambla de Cantalunya 18) amazing tapas food. CDCL near the marina (prob the best restaurant I have ever been to) \u00a350 per head roughly. (look on their website) I would also recommend the tour bus.

Getting to the hotel from the airport was a bit pricey as we weren't sure of its location we decided to take a cab which cost about 35 euros so best to plan your journey from the airport in advance (one shuttle and metro ride is all it took as we later found out). We were welcomed by a friendly face who informed us that they had automatically upgraded our room for free and that we had a sea view. The lobby and bar areas were just as trendy as in the pictures and the room also. Great view overlooking the sea and below us a clear view of the pool area. After a hot journey took a shower and the bathroom facilities were excellent with luxury aveda products. The room was well air-conditioned which you could control and with electric curtains and mood-lighting it was easy to adjust to how you wanted it. No sign of any smell throughout the hotel as mentioned in previous reviews so they have obviously addressed that problem. As we were there for a couple of days we didn't really use much of the hotel facilities other than the bar which was very trendy and reasonably priced depending on what you were drinking. On the satursay night there was a big party going on but it didn't exclude us from going anywhere and although it went on until the early hours no noise travelled to our room so was obviously well soundproofed. Good advice on where to go for a nice meal was provided by the lady on the desk she also explained how and where to use the transport system. Metro was just a 5 - 10 min walk and the tram was situated just outside the hotel. Both ran frequently and you could obtain a card for just 7 euros which lasted both my partner and i the whole trip. Breakfast in the hotel was excellent i could have happily just sat there and eat it all day. Good selection from pastries to fresh fruits, smoked salmon to cheeses. There was something for everyone and plenty of it too. All in all we had a wonderful stay and would definatley go back perhaps for longer and use more of the hotel services the spa and gym looked inviting. Its so hard to sum up our wonderful stay in just a few small paragraphs. Would definatley recommend visiting the hotel for either business or pleasure as from overhearing a few conversations in the lobby they offer great conference facilities also.", "Date": "August 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "west mids", "Title": "\u201cchavtastic\u201d", "Author": "bheth", "ReviewID": "UR37296315", "Content": "if you are over 25 do not stay here.

So after checking in we went to \"our\" room to find out that someone had this room already. This is worst case in a hotel I think. The guy in \"our\" room was not amused as well. Then we came with our car and had a rate where parking was included, but all the time you wanted to leave you had to explain that because the always wanted to charge for parking. So they always called someone to ask if this is possible to have parking included - very annoying. Also the reception staff was not very friendly.
