This was our first visit to Hong Kong and it was good. The hotel is in a very good location a five minute walk from the harbour front in Kowloon. They offer a free transfer from Kowloon rail station to and from the airport. The staff are friendly and conceiage staff very helpful with directions sightseeing tips etc. We had a few drinks in the hotel bar and the barman was very pleasant. Hotel room was good size double room, clean my only issue was we couldnt open a window and there was a slightly damp smell of fousty air conditioning when we first got to the room. This did wear off as soon as we turned air con on. We had breakfast in hotel one morning but I wouldnt really recommend it as we got to the dining room at 10.30am and told we were too late for the buffet and had to order from the menu which was expensive for what we actually had when there were so many places close to the hotel we could have gone instead. It was slightly annoying as the buffet was still out but the staff were just starting to clear it away and still said no. There is wifi access in the hotel but it is not free although if you drink in the bar they will give you the access code. I would stay here again for ease and location as the rooms are good the staff are friendly but just dont use the dining room. There are loads of places nearby to eat and drink. Shops are very close and if you are on a short stay I highly recommend doing the Big Red Bus Tour. Fantastic was to see Kowloon and Hong Kong Island if you are pushed for time it also included tram and ferry tickets. On the whole great location, clean hotel friendly staff for a short stay I recommed it for value for money.", "Date": "September 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, decent sized room\u201d", "Author": "Syllaw", "ReviewID": "UR139430887", "Content": "We stayed in Park Hotel for 4nights at superior room.

Within 6mins (from the time i called), my problem was solved. Excellent service. Location was really the selling point. Five mins walk from Exit B2, Tsim sha tsui MTR at leisure pace. There was two doors, one main door and one side door. I used side door all the time, closed around 12 midnight and it is along Cameron Rd. Around hotel, there are a lot of eateries, convenient stores, shops such as city chain, croc, sasa, etc. Even shopping malls with supermarkets are just around the corner. Knutsford terrace for dining and drinking is nearby too. The surrounding is crowded, well lit (shops closed around midnight). I felt safe all the time when I walked around hotel area even at midnight. Opposite hotel side door is the K4 bus stop (free bus shuttle to airport express Station). Make sure you stand right beside the bus sign and spot the bus (mini bus, blue color) as early as possible and wave for it frantically. The bus driver drove passed us even though we waved for it. Perhaps we didnt wave in big gesture so he didnt see us. Overall, Park hotel is excellent.

We did not receive a warm greeting or really much of a welcome from any of the staff (no smile, hello, good morning/evening or head nod) when we encountered them during our stay; except from the housekeepers who would smile and say hello in the morning in the hallways. When we arrived, the duvet cover was dirty and it took over 1 hour, 3 staff and 4 stained duvet covers for the hotel to provide us with an unstained duvet cover. Perhaps most disappointing was that during this duvet fiasco, we were never once offered an apology... terrible. We also found that the staff's proficiency level with English was rather low considering that the property is in a location that caters to (a) tourists and (b) business travelers. Additionally, I was surprised that English language abilities varied quite drastically from Front Desk Agent to Front Desk Agent as I surely would have thought that there would have been a higher base-line proficiency required to be in a position of that nature with such a high level of guest interaction. Overall the property seemed dated, with the exception of the washroom which was well maintained, and it did not have the metropolitan-feel that the website portrays.

My only complaint was regarding internet access. I only travel with my IPAD and when I checked in was told that wireless was not available on the floor my room was on., They moved me (hence the very small room) however the wireless was not reliable.

Location is great - at the heart of TST allows us to shop around the area... Airport Express shuttle bus stop at entrance is another plus, as this prevent massive walking with big luggages in HK streets. Checking in takes a while as the front desk experience some trouble locating a room for me - not a big enough concern for me as that still take less than 10 minutes. We're given 3 rooms; 2 decently sized and 1 small room - so if you're after standard sized rooms normally seen overseas, upgrade your rooms; If you're planning to book superior rooms, avoid corner rooms. Toilet amenities are adequate - you'll get the standard sets but not of superior quality. Bed is fairly comfortable, it's interesting that Park Hotel is still using fairly dated air-con and light controls. Air-con performance is not very stable. TV is small with some selection of cable TV channels...However I don't think this is what you come to HK for? In terms of the room condition I'm slightly disappointed as it still looked a little dated even though there're some renovations done a few years ago. There's one point that I've noticed during my stay - The staff are generally polite and helpful however some of them have problems with communication in English/Mandarin. They're usually friendly when speaking in Cantonese (No problem for me since I speak Cantonese); however they sound DEMANDING and sometimes HOSTILE when speaking in Mandarin and English. Management might want to train up the staff in communication - it would really be a shame if a customer is angered/annoyed not due to bad attitude but poor choice of words/speech. I would probably expect staff at front desk and conceirge to speak fluent (if not polished) English and Mandarin. It's very evident that the staff are struggling when they're communicating with customers who speak English/Mandarin in heavy accent. Noticed that some of the reviews mentioned rude staff - that might be one of the reasons! Overall the stay is pretty pleasent, although it has gone through a face lift a few years ago, somehow I still feel that the hotel needs a little more touch up.

Cons: bad first impression - we arrived very late at night from a flight from Australia with 3 kids aged 10 and under, and our rooms were not ready. We had to wait around reception for 30 mins or so before we could go to the rooms, then instead of being able to go to bed, we had to wait in our rooms for another half an hour while they eventually bought in the extra beds and made them up - not the most fun when you have really tired children and you've just come off a long flight. The only other \"down side\" as such would be the limited dinner menu both via room service and from the in-house restaurant - but, as we stayed there for 10 nights probably anything would get a little old after a while so this was not the biggest deal. General: Despite the first blip, we enjoyed our stay and would happily stay there again. The hotel is good value for money and the staff were very accommodating - we booked a one day tour into Southern China and the staff were good enough to make up a breakfast for us to take away (in lieu of the buffet) since the buffet would not be open before we departed.

Arrived from Beijing and checked-in with a group of 12. This was the last of a 4-city tour. We arrived and checked in about 9:00 pm. About a 45-minute drive from the Airport and located across from HK Island in Kowloon. Check-in was simple as the group guide handled everything. This was the first of 4 hotel stays that each room had to leave credit cards for deposits. Not a big deal, just did not have to do it at the prior hotels. Entered hotel from the Cameron road entrance. Fairly small lobby with concierge and registration desk. Located at the corner of Chatham and Cameron Rd. Very busy area and easy walk to waterfront, shops, Nathan Road, and subway. The room is average Western hotel size but with twin beds. Note that we found the beds to be hard. But it was not as hard as our Shanghai hotel stay. It was manageable and we were able to sleep fine with minimum exterior noise. The bathroom was avg size with awesome shower head. Amenities were included and it was clean. The room had great technology that allowed us to manage the lights from the bed. The room was a little dark, even with all the lights on. Again it was manageable. We awoke after checking in and prepared for tour. Roommate indicated she had a scratchy throat. We headed to breakfast on the 4th floor which was included in our plan. It is a buffet with a great selection for guests from multiple countries. Everything in the cafe was clean and the buffet was good. Did some touring and returned late to rest. The next morning we each woke with scratchy or sore throats. As we spoke to others in our group, learned that several had the same symptoms. We returned early to our room and found it quite stuffy so turned the air down. When returned later that night after dinner, our room was freezing and our comforters and clothing felt damp. We figured it was due to the humidity. The next morning we met up with some group members and went to Big Budda. During the ride we talked about our trip and hotel. We learned that we had the same challenges. Damp clothing and bedding as well as scratchy throats. When we got back to the hotel, we stopped at the front desk and told them our challenges. It was then that we learned there was a mold problem!!!!! I truly believe the person that told us let it slip. Because it was our last night, we decided to stay in the room. When we got to the room, we realized that the black marks all over the walls in the room was mold. We slept with our masks on thinking that we would be fine. Well, we progressively got worse and each woke with stuffy heads and sinus problems. Called the front desk to speak to the manager and let him know about our challenges. By this time, I'd lost my voice and it was obvious I was sick. The manager was gracious with offering assistance for anything we needed. He sent up extra water which we definitely needed as we warned water for neti pots ans tea. We must have looked really bad to the person that delivered the water. After he left, we got another call asking if we would like a doctor's consultation. I will admit, we were in pretty bad shape. And it was terrible as we were headed back to the states (36 hours of traveling). While we waited to check-out, we were approached by a different manager about our stay and to confirm our room number (#620). He apologized for our stay. As we talked, another in our party expressed her disapointment. Turns out that we were all on the 6th floor and all had a scratchy throat of dampness in our rooms. Needless to say, I cannot recommend this hotel. As I type this review, I am still sick. I am confident that it is no cooincidence that several in our group got sick and only after checking into this hotel. The air-conditioning system is not working well to combat the HK humidity.

We had booked a superior room with a rollaway as there were 3 of us. On checking in, we were advised that we had been upgraded to a deluxe room. There were 2 large twin beds and a rollaway and still plenty of room to walk around. The bar in the lobby has happy hour every night - very good wines and value. The staff were friendly and very helpful as were the housekeeping ladies. Across the road (Cameron Rd entrace) there is a fantastic noodle eatery which is opened 24 hours. We arrived at the hotel at about midnight and felt a little peckish and discovered this gem. Delicious steamed prawn dumplings, chicken wrapped in steamed tofu. The next night we had dinner there - the deep fried wontons are to die for, as is the salt and pepper tofu. The day before we left I had to have lunch there - delicious. I will definitely be back at the Park Hotel for my next Hong Kong trip and definitely back at the noodle eatery - I just wish I knew the name of that place.

Well, check out the Park Hotel Hong Kong. Stayed in a deluxe room for three nights. Room was roomy. It even had space for a couch and coffee table. There was a nook with a table and chair. The furniture is nothing to shout about. Wooden, dark coloured closet, bed, chairs, tables. Nothing fanciful but enough. Complimentary drinking water, replenished daily. Toiletries are adequate. No separate shower but there is a bathtub. Housekeeping is efficient and staff polite and friendly. Read some reviews that mentioned smell of cigarette smoke, even in non-smoking rooms. I took a non-smoking room and had no problems with the air. All this comes at a reasonable room rate. There are hotels in Hong Kong that have smaller rooms but with higher rates. View from window: It looks into other buildings. No skyline. Check-in was efficient and pleasant enough. Did not eat in the hotel, so no comment. But Internet access at the business centre is costly. Location of the hotel is second to none if you want to be in the middle of it all. Bright lights, shops, malls, restaurants, transport (bus and MTR) all within walking distance. Busy, busy, busy. The facade of the hotel looks nothing like the one shown on its website. It has been renovated and the main entrance does not open to Chatham Rd South but is at the \"back' now, at Granville Circuit. There is a side entrance/exit that opens to Cameron Road at the \"side\". This is closed at midnight. An observation though. The side entrance is open 6am to midnight and people can walk in and out, whether they are guests or not. And the lifts to the rooms are near the side entrance. So anyone can take the lifts and gain access to any floor. There are cameras and the concierge desk is near the lifts but sometimes the staff are busy and they cannot keep an eye on those who come in from the side entrance. Perhaps something can be done to enhance security, like using access cards in order to take the lifts to the room floors. A bonus: King's Lodge restaurant is a few steps away from the hotel.

Slightly run down with the stale smell of cigarette smoke that was unsuccessfully masked by a sickly sweet air freshner on what was a non smoking floor (so we were told by reception). The \"western\" food of the breakfast buffet is still very \"eastern\" and this takes a bit of getting used to. For example...would like to see more than dragonfruit and watermelon as the ONLY fresh fruit choices and also bacon that is not paper thin cured ham with a very bland \"wok fried\" taste. More than half of the \"hot food\" on the \"western buffet\" was either overcooked, undercooked or not at temperature (hotter than 60 degrees) fit for serving. My MAIN BEEF about this place is not actually with the hotel, but more to do with where it is situated...the hotel foyer opens onto a pedestrian crossing that for 18 hours a day is frequented by touters trying to sell western tourists suits, blouses and tailor made clothing. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't THE SAME two people asking the same question to the same western person (Me) every time I came or went from the hotel for the entire duration of my stay. There were two other \"small\" issues (once again that are not entirely the fault of the hotel...but need to be mentioned as part of an unbiased review) 1. A local cab driver parked in the designated TAXI area for this hotel refused to take us to the China Ferry terminal as he was waiting for a \"better fare\". The reception staff did NOTHING to report this driver (after I specifically asked them to do so because it is against the law in Hong Kong for a Taxi driver to do this) and also 2. My wife and I were approached in the corridor of the 7th floor as we were returning to our room for the night at a fraction after midnight asking us if we would like a \"special mass-ar-gee\" as they had just finished in the room beside ours...

The front desk and concierge staff are friendly and quick with check in/out. Services are speedy and efficient from the housekeeping staff as well. Rooms are well equipped and clean. Only complaints would be the comfort of the room sandals, the non-user-friendly features of the room controls for light, tv, etc, and the comfort of the bed. There is internet using cable but it would be great to have wireless so that we can connect using our portable phone/iPad. Breakfast is well varied with oriental and international selections. Being in Hong Kong though, the expectations for dim sums are naturally higher but it could be a slight disappointment seeing the selection in the hotel.

We caught the airexpress/train straight from arrivals where we bought a one off ticket, easy and cheap and clean!

The bus driver pointed and a helpful porter arrived to take all our 11 items of luggage, taken directly to our rooms. The room was big enough x2 single beds in each and later they brought up a very comfortable and clean fold out bed. As a non smoker i was upset to find the rooms were smoking ones and stank, after complaining realised we hadnt asked for non smoking on the travel agents booking and as they were interconnecting we decided to stay they did offer to move us but to separate floors. After they opened windows the rooms began to air. They were of adequate size and the location was the best, we walked everywhere, taxi however to Mong Kong, Ladies market and Disney(that was awful) the staff were all excellent and couldn't help more!

Finding an hotel with a good quality but not too expensive was a little bit difficult also considering that we needed an hotel near the city center (\u2026 does Hong Kong has a real city center... maybe not!). because we need to move using buses and subway. We decided to stay in this hotel in Kowloon because it is in a quite strategic position: near the sea (10 minutes walking from Victoria Harbour street), very near to Natan Street and few subway's stations from Temple Street Market. Moreover the hotel is on a secondary street so there is no noise during the night. Due to the small main entrance hidden between shops it is not easy to find it (when the taxi leave us in front of the hotel we weren't sure to be in the right place but after few minutes we identified the hall. The personnel at the reception was very kind and, even if the room wasn\u2019t ready (we arrived very early in the morning) they allowed us to leave our luggage at the concierge in order to start visiting the city. The room was a little bit small but to spend some night in Hong Kong was enough. The bathroom was very small and with no windows. However both the room and the bathroom were very clean and they changed the towels everyday. We had some problem with the WC but calling the reception they solved them very quickly. Breakfast was good and you can eat everything you want: fruit (the dragon fruit was not so good), vegetables, cakes, biscuits, brioches, eggs and bacon\u2026 Also the coffee was quite good! At the end I think that Hotel Park Kowloon can be a good place to spend some days in Hong Kong. Some more suggestion for some days in Hong Kong: consider using the multi days Big Bus Tour to visit the city (it is less expensive than using the public transport (especially the subway is very expensive), visit Temple Street Market during the evening (very amazing place where you can buy everything), spend some time walking along Natan Street street and look the jeweller\u2019s shops and the traditional pharmacies.

We were back again from 17 to 21 June 11. This time round, it was a hell for us. We were given room 625 and first night, everything was ok. To be kind to earth, I've chosen not to change our bedspread after the first night. On the 2nd night, my daughter complained of some rashes on her legs & hands and we thought it's time to change the bedspread.....and so we put in our request. The rashes on my daughter didn't go away and there were more after the 3rd night, and we confirmed she was bitten by bed bugs. My hubby & I were free from the bugs and apparently these bugs will confine to a certain area on the bedding and not spreading to the whole mattress. So my poor daughter who has been sleeping in the same side of the bed since first night was the only one being attacked. Immediately the next morning (last night of our stay), I reported to the housekeeping lady who was cleaning in the room beside us, about the incident. She offered to give us additional bedspread to cover the bed headboard just in case the bugs were from the wooden headboard and to clean our room thoroughly. Midday, we called up the hotel in the midst of our sightseeing to request to change room just to be on the safe end but they claimed that the hotel was full house. However, they offer to change our beds. The same night, I was sitting on the bed watching TV show and felt something biting my under thigh, I quickly got up and caught a bug right on the spot, killed it and blood could be seen :( It's only when I got back home to visit the doctor that I knew it was a bed bug. Since it's our final night, we didn't want to go through the hassle to change room or beddings (we have given the hotel the benefit of doubt that they have changed our beds). My hubby slept on the usual spot that my daughter has slept for the past few nights and we have shifted our beds away from the headboard to be double sure. And thank god my husband was free from bug attacked. BUT the horror didn't end here, while I was packing my luggage ready for check-out, I saw a bed bug crawling on my luggage, YUCKS! Again I wiped it OFF immediately. I believe the bugs are everywhere in the room even on the carpet otherwise the little parasite wouldn't have crawled onto my luggage. We brought our daughter to the doctor immediately upon reaching home and I'm now in the midst of disinfecting my luggages. It was indeed a disappointed & stressful stay in Park Hotel!

There is a delicious juice stand right in front of the hotel entrance that makes all kinds of juices, so that was also a plus for me as we did not have the breakfast included. Also, for any young women who love to shop, there is a fantastic little ally right in front of the backside entrance of the hotel, by the bar. You would think nothing of the tiny, kind of dirty looking entrance, but inside there are 5 floors or awesome tiny little stores arranged in a sort of circular maze, with amazing, super original clothes for pretty good prices.

In many publication, you can see a big Park Hotel sign in the corner of Chatham Road South and Cameron Road, but it's now has turned into huge watch advertisement space. The Cameron Road entrance will direct you to the elevators to every floor and the real lobby is behind it. Check-in Lobby is very small, there are 2 set of sofa, a small cafe, a business center, and concierge (doubled as tour desk and bell service) desk. Not really a 4-star feeling, but more to modern 3-star. Staff that was checking me in was not that hospitable and a little rude. I gave her my booking slip, but she pushed it back and instead asking for passport number. This was the first time I treated that way. I was too lazy to ask for room preferences (since I made a booking via travel agent, asking room preferences were not an option) since the staff has indifferent attitude. She put me in Room 526 on 5th floor (the hotel lobby is on L level, restaurant at 4th, guest rooms from 5th floor onwards). The Room My room was the last in the corridor (it's corner room, but only has 1 window facing Cameron Road). The room has adequate soundproofing. I didn't hear any outside noise (despite it's a busy street down there and I was only in the 5th floor). It was a smoking room, but since it has recently undergone renovation, I smelt no appalling smoke smell at all. Room size is bigger than most Hong Kong standard, adequate for a 4-star property. Internet is not free, but wired line is readily available. Room has 2 single beds (more like large single, but not quite double size, approx 120cm x 200cm each), set of 2-chair and table, writing desk, plasma TV, mini bar (fully stocked), luggage rack, and wardrobe cabinet with in-room safe. Furniture is made of wood with brown black hue. Striped carpet and earth tone wallpaper really brings out the modern feeling of the room. However, some furniture have showing its age (it was painted, so that when some edges scape something, the paint will come out). Not that good for a recently renovated hotel. The Bathroom Bathroom is pretty spacious with toilet, sink, and bathtub/shower combination although the bathtub is not of full adult-size. Bathroom amenities are very generous and well-presented despite using generic hotel supplies (not supplied by certain body care purveyor) - for those who have read about the horror stories of how certain hotel used to refill these things, it's a bad news. 2 complimentary bottles of water are of very generous size (each of 750ml bottle). Overall presentation is flawless, but looking carefully into the details, I found some flaws: There is a hardened fungus mold around the toilet flush. Not good for a newly renovated room. Also, the shower curtain has bad design: only has 1 layer, so if you put the curtain outward (not bordering the tub from inside), water will flood the bathroom floor. Also, the nearest drain is located somewhere near the sink, not very good design. (see photos) Hotel facilities I didn't use any of the hotel facilities, so can't comment on this. But the business center is very small, just consists of cubicles with 2 computers. That's all. Looks uninviting. Even airline lounge has better amenities and space. Room service is - as other hotels - pricey. Security This is where Park Hotel Hongkong really lacks. The hotel is really open to everyone. The elevators to guest rooms are very close to Cameron Road entrance and yet I never saw any security guard patrolling the area (not I'd ever seen any security guard in the hotel), so everyone can walk in freely into the property. Provided they're just having a renovation, not installing a keycard recognition access in the elevator can lessen the secure feeling of its guests. Departure Check-out was swift. Don't bother about reception staff at this time, but bellboy was very courteous. Verdict For the price, it's one of the affordable and value choice at touristy TST area. However, the hotel still needs better care and maintenance if it wants to keep the property in good standing. Also, staff definitely needs more hospitality training on how to treat guests with a smile.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cDecent rooms and close to shopping and dining options\u201d", "Author": "eatshopeatshop", "ReviewID": "UR87343885", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights here.

Had turned up in the hotel before 9 AM after a night flight, and the reception asked us to wait for an hour after completing the formalities quickly, and after 40 minutes or so, we were in the room. The rooms were spacious & clean. The hotel location was itself very unassuming. Specially the small door on Cameron street. But room quality is very well 4 star category. Even though the beds creaked a bit, the pillows were super soft & plentiful, and the bathroom functional & adequate. The in-room safe was handy. The concierge in the lobby were extremely polite & helpful. Although the view from the room was not that great, the hotel makes this up by offering a fantastic location. Opening on Cameron street, which boasts of innumerable cut-price cosmetic & perfume shops, and an easy 5 minute walk to the Tsim Tsa Shui MTR station. The back gate was seconds away from Granville Road, which had a number of outlets to shop from. The main thoroughfare of Kowloon, Nathan Road was also near to the MTR entry. And with it more boutiques for shopping. And we found SALE signs on almost each of these (thankfully, because shopping in Hong Kong is atleast as expensive as Europe, if not more). For local currency, the Hang Seng branch is your best bet. We got a rate of 7.739 HKD (per USD) minus a charge of $50 HKD (fixed charge for any amount). The branch opens at 9 AM on weekdays, and is located between the TST MTR & the hotel. You can't miss it. There was a post of another reviewer who recommended the fresh fruit juice shop just outside the gate, and I wholly second his view. The Coconut Sago was the best. And other tropical fruits were displayed which we hadn't seen before. Very reasonable prices too ($6-12 only). The \"Ireland's potato\" shop nearby had Chinese music, but tasty fries. But your best bet would be to stock up in the Park cafe's breakfast. All the fruit you would ever want, and the regular 4-star buffet. The sombre (and portly) Omelette chef \"Man\" was delightful to look at. But ask him to make your fry a bit well cooked! There were more local food options on the Cameron street, one with delectable ducks displayed by the window, but we couldn't try it (most of the group was vegetarian). My dad however tried the Royal Foot spa down the same road for a foot massage ($148), and was impressed. Travelling anywhere in HK is easy. MTR goes everywhere. And coupled with an Octopus card, you dont have to hunt for change for tickets. Taxis are very reasonably priced too, in case your shopping weary feet wants to take it easy. 4 days went in no time. 1st day for the Ngong Ping cable car (recommend the crystal cabin; great views & shorter lines), the touristy village. Dont miss a visit to the Chopstick gallery shop there. Great for souvenirs. The stairs to Big Buddha were not much of a problem to tackle than first imagined, and the view was great. Then it was time to get some bargains on the Timberland/Samsonite & other stores in the nearby Citygate outlet malls. Travel by MTR on this stretch. Also get a 10% discount coupon from the cable car website before you go. 2nd day was for Ocean Park. Get the MTR to Admiralty, and you cant miss the signs for bus 629 to Ocean Park. Reserve a full day for this park, if you wish to 'do' everything. i cant cover ocean park here, would take too much space. but whatever you do, dont miss the atoll reef. another tip - take your cable car tickets to ocean park to get a 10% discount. 3rd day morning we went to Chi Lin Nunnery & the Nan Lian Garden. The Garden was very impressive & photo worthy, but the monastery will take your breath away. Again a quick MTR stop. We did good use of the nearby Hollywood Plaza mall with some bargains, even though we missed the walking tour of Mongkok & surrounding markets due to lack of time. At 8 in the evening, we trundled to the Avenue of Stars for the symphony of lights show. Overrated attraction, and not worth at all. Better to spend time at TST local market, and to try local food, or at least the great desserts. The last day we took the ferry to Central, and then a taxi to Man Mo temple. A must visit if you've not done a Chinese temple before. Then the utterly crowded & missable tram to Causeway bay to do some more shopping at Times Square mall & the Japanese Sogo store. We still missed a lot of sightseeing in HK, but coming back to the topic, I think Park hotel is a worthy & value place to stay in HK. For easy reach to local ambience, and the service offered, I absolutely recommend it.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "alicejaneLondon", "ReviewID": "UR54173650", "Content": "We stayed here two nights and found it a perfect base for exploring Hong Kong- particularly Kowloon.

Also very near the MTR which is really useful. The rooms are nice, not great luxury but extremely comfortable and we were upgraded to a deluxe room (I think there was a mix up with our room booking and they had allocated us a twin). The room was nice and big, everything impeccably clean. No complaints whatsoever about the rooms and common areas. The staff were also extremely helpful and ever so polite. This was in fact mirrored throughout Hong Kong and people would go out of their way to help you. We didn't eat at the hotel but what we loved about Kowloon was that there are so many Chinese authentic places to choose from.

Their renovations are now completed and the lobby is now functional and operating. I enjoyed my stay both times. This is a no-frills hotel with all basic amenities. Price is a little high for the accommodation...the furniture are pretty much IKEA quality. But service is first rate. Although in the heart of very busy streets, inside the bedrooms is surprisingly quiet. The walls are thin though. One night I could clearly hear the guest next door coming in at night, opening the door and putting down his/her stuff. Other than that it was always quiet. Very polite & courteous guests all around who stay here. They don't have room service, but serve buffet breakfasts and dinners, and also a reasonably priced late night buffet from 10:30-11:30pm on Thurs, Fri and Sat nites. No mini-bar, but there's a fridge with sodas and bottled waters in there. THEY ARE NOT FREE!!! Buy your bottled waters at 7-11 down the street. The location of this hotel is awesome if you're here for leisure. You're less than 5 mins walk from the MTR station. Taxis stop by in front all the time. Across the street is the airport shuttle stop. As soon as your walk outside there are bajillion restaurants of all type, Japanese ramen, Korean bbq, tapas and bar, kaiten sushi, Japanese teppayaki, Catonese rice/noodle plates and bbq/roast meat, etc. etc. Around the corner on Chatham road there's a dumping place that has long lines at night, so I assume food there is great. Besides food, down Cameron Road there is a 7/11 and Watson's if you need any basic convenience type stuff or OTC medications. On Cameron Street there are also several cosmetic stores that sell lots and lots of stuff at whole-sale prices, including brand name cosmetic items from Estee Lauder to La Prairie ,and hair care products too. There's a SaSa on the street as well but if you're not a local with an account, the whole sale stores are a much better bargain. Threre are several foot massage places we noticed. The smaller ones look seedy but there are 2 big legit ones nearby: the Royal Foot Spa on Cameron Road, and another one around the corner from the hotel if you walk toward the MTR Station. It's got Japanese writings on its store sign. Both are on second floor from walk-ups. The Royal has a greeter at the entrance on the first floor on the street. We tried both, and definitely prefer the Royal, better more soothing massage technique. At the other one, the foot massages were painful. There are also tons of bars and Cantonese dessert places. Many restaurants and bars are actually on second or third floors of buildings so don't just go buy what you see at eye level. Look up from time to time to find more great fun places. Absolutely do not miss having a cup of fruit or vegetable juice from the juice stand directly across from the hotel's entrance on Cameron Rd. They have one of the best coconut juices I've ever had anywhere in HK. Also next to it is a little stand that sells french fries (with cheese sauce, meat sauce, whatever sauce of your choice), bake potatoes and hot dogs. It's a fun snack and if you got kids they'll love them. Basically, this whole area is like one big amusement park for adult leisure travelers.

(: Other than that, there's basically nothing else to complain about this lovely hotel. I've a couple of pictures here and there for their rooms, lobby, toilets and all. Spick and Span, clean and squek (: When you first arrive there, they usually station a couple of bell boys and a manager to direct you to the 4th floor for the reception/booking into hotel rooms and so. So there's not much of a problem. The only complain that I've about this particular hotel is that I find that certain female receptionists at the desk are not friendly at all. I suppose they could use a little bit more of a smile on their faces when welcoming their guests. It was surprising to find that the male receptionists and managers are much more friendlier than the females. We took the Deluxe Room in the Park Hotel, it was just as spacious as it was shown in the hotel's main website! Location of Park Hotel is at Tsim Sha Tsui, it's a great location. Why so? Because the hotel itself, is surrounded by numerous numbers of eateries and dessert stores! It is also of walking distance around 10-15(max) minutes to the 2 nearest MTR stations named as East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station and Tsimm Sha Tsui MTR Station. Just below it's hotel, has 2 great eateries. Particularly one called the GuangDong restaurant. But I would prefer calling it a cafe, because of it's mid-level range prices. (: Other than that, there's this famous 'wife cake' bakery just round it's corner called the ''Wing Wah''. Apparently famous for it's ''Lao Po Bing'', one must try and buy it! Pretty cheap. For 6 in a box, it costs only $4SGD. Besides that, every single time whenever we call for room service, to makeup our rooms. I must particularly praise the maid that helps us tidy our rooms, despite seeing that we still do have tubes of shampoo, body bath lying around in the shower room. She never fails to replenish the tubes on the basin. Let's just say we had nevereverending amount of body bath/shampoo for our entire 6 nights stay there (: Also, it's an easy place for one to grab a taxi. Taxis are plentiful over there during the day and nighttime. From Tsim Sha Tsui to headover to Mongkok would usually take you around $8SGD(MAX). It's of extremely close proximity to head to anywhere by taxis. I would say that for the price paid, service given and a comfortable & enjoyable time in Park Hotel. Totally worth it. During our checkout, it was lovely that the hotel conceirge actually allowed us to check in our luggage with them still and head back later only to collect them when were heading to the airport to fly back to Singapore. OH! Particularly busy during nighttime at the corner area there, so be sure to ask for higher levels and non-smoking rooms! I would say, we're definitely returning back to park hotel if we're ever heading to Hong Kong again.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cStop looking!

Also from the station you can walk to harbour city mall (huge!). It's an extremely busy area so expect to be able to find a lot of fast foods and also HK style cafes.

You don't get a sense of the size of the hotel from its entrance. That's because currently its lobby and makeshift lobby and reception are both located on the fourth floor. The rooms are smart and comfortable and are not huge, as you would expect in a city where space crunch can felt acutely. The service is pleasant and the food can be very good. The best thing about the hotel--to return to my original point--is its location. You just come down the elevator and step into Tsim Tsa Tsui, which in the heart of Kowloon. The metro rail station is a couple of minutes walk down Chatham Road. Tsim Tsa Tsui is abuzz at all times and it is the best place to get a taste of Hong Kong. Quite literally so, given the number of eateries on Nathan Road, or Peking Road, or the criss-crossing lanes along those major avenues. Non-stop shopping opportunities too. And, no, that Hong Kong is an expensive destination is somewhat of a myth. If you have the luxury of time and are patient, you will find the right place to eat and shop and be happy. Travel is not a problem at all. There's the metro and taxis aren't too expensive. To go across to Hong Kong Island there's the Star Ferry. The Ocean Terminal, the Hong Kong Space Museum and many other places of cultural interest are all in the vicinity of Park Hotel.

We do not need direction to shop as we are very familiar with the place.", "Date": "June 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat newly renovated rooms\u201d", "Author": "zetariel", "ReviewID": "UR6342714", "Content": "I read reviews from trip advisor on this hotel in july and decided to book this hotel. Many thanks to the reviews. I couldn't agree more that this is a value for money place to stay. We had 2 connecting rooms on the 6th floor. Extra bed were given to us for each room without extra charges. Everything in the room were new. Rooms are spacious and the chamber maid is very friendly and obliging. I am very fussy when it comes to hotel accomodation. So i took a risk even though i knew the hotel is under renovation. We arrived on Sat afternoon. The exterior of the hotel is stil covered up with green mesh. But it doesn't matter. Renovation noise is barely there. Sun there is no renovation on going. We had late check out at 6pm which is very helpful as our flight back home is in the evening. We were able to leave our kids in the room to rest while we continued some last minute shopping. I have stayed in some better hotels in HK before but i must say i am the most satisfied with this stay as everything is perfect! The hotel has great location. It's near to MTR, restaurants, shops. We took the airport bus which is very near to the hotel also. I will definitely consider staying there again !", "Date": "December 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cit was ok\u201d", "Author": "Fussyperson", "ReviewID": "UR5928232", "Content": "Having read the previous reports I wondered what our travel agent had let us in for but all 6 people in our group thought that the hotel was ok and above the 4 star average.

The hotel was recommended by Qantas as a good, convenient, not-too-flashy hotel. It doesn't have the acres of lobby and chandeliers that many other HK hotels seem to have but our rooms were spacious and clean with a small fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, a retractable clothes line above the bath/shower and, very importantly, excellent airconditioning. Public transport access was great, hotel staff were helpful and there was a 7-11 nearby for stocking up on cold drinks.

The only good this about this hotel is the location. The rooms are terrible, they smell of damp and have huge damp patches on the walls and ceilings. The carpets are a disgrace, the beds are very very old fusty and smelly. The curtains are the same. I was devastated when we arrived there, we were travelling in a big group so we just had to put up with it, there wasnt even a bar to socialise in with our friends so we went to the Aussie bar just across the road the Kangaroo Bar, (which i highly recommend). The hotel is undergoing serious renovation, you cant even see out of your window its that bad. In my opinion it should be closed at the moment.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cPark Hotel - still under renovations\u201d", "Author": "melach2009", "ReviewID": "UR5022777", "Content": "While the Park Hotel was in a convenient location with respect to closeness to the MTR and Nathan Road, it did not give us good impression when from the road the whole hotel was \"shrouded\" in green mesh as it was and is still undergoing renovations. Speaking to one of the friendly staff, we found out that the renovations would be still ongoing for another 12 months. The room that we were initially allocated when we first arrived was in the far corner of the building after having to pass through a fire-door. The room was terrible with flaking paint, musty smell and fading carpets. One redeeming thing was we got transferred to a better room without any hassles when we requested for it. Nevertheless, the bathrooms-cum-toilet was small and was definitely not impressed with its aluminium-lined ceiling at all. Hopefully, with the renovations the size would be enlarged. No complaints about the friendliness of the hotel staff and the service. However, the reception area was small, and not much of an area where you could sit comfortably. Would not consider staying there again, until at least till the renovations are fully completed. But then again ....... This being our second trip to Hong Kong, it would pay to stay in one of the international hotel chains, or at least a four-star rated hotel. Yes, will have to pay a bit more, but my personal feeling is that such is the vibrancy of Hong Kong, it would be a pity to return to a less than comfortable hotel after an exciting day out, even if it just to sleep. Cannot comment on the food within the hotel, but there are enough eating places right around the hotel to tempt the palate.", "Date": "May 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cHotel still under renovation and to be avoided.\u201d", "Author": "dubbo", "ReviewID": "UR4952829", "Content": "The park Hotel was well below average. After 6 weeks touring Europe we ended up at the Park Hotel for 4 nights. We had ordered a triple superior room suitable for 3 adults.

We complained and were given a larger triple room that backed onto the elevators and the room used by the service staff as a utility room, noise most of the night and highly unsatisfactory.

It's clean, the room is just enough, though it's not yet renovated. The room has hot and cold water, complete toiletries, hairdryer, empty ref and tv. Since we left in the morning and comes back late in the evening, we didn't feel the noise of the renovation being made. The lobby is quite small, hope it will be bigger after renovation. My comment is you can hear the sound of the vehicles from the outside, though it didn't bothered us. It's two blocks away from the MTR TST station in Nathan Rd, and this is the most important thing coz you can go anywhere to the great tourist spots. There are lots of small stores in the vicinity, like 7-11 watsons,photo/cellphone, drugstore, eatery, tailor, mcdo and souveneir shop for your last minute shopping. You can walk from the hotel towards the kowlooon park and ocean center/terminal where the big shops are. One night from the Avenue of Stars we just found ourselves just walking to the hotel. The staff are great and will assist you patiently and tell you where to ride / exit and how to go back to your place. You can leave your bags for a late check-out w/o addl charge.
