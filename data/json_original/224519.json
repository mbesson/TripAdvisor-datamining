Firstly, it was expensive, i.e. over 250 US dollars. However, no breakfast is provided (unlike some other guest houses in Key West) and the rooms are small. Showers and toilets have been added to the rooms making them smaller. There were no cupboards in my room, although some hooks and hangers are provided. I had a lousy mattress in my bedroom which sagged when I lay down on it and I spent a sleepless night tossing and turning. To their credit they gave me another room the next morning, but it took some insistence on my part. The pool area is too close to many of the rooms and is noisy, especially at happy hour, so don't count on an afternoon nap.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed\u201d", "Author": "urbandilettante315", "ReviewID": "UR126409290", "Content": "We were very disappointed in our stay in the main part of the Eden House. The rooms were so small there was hardly room to move around. The carpet was grimy and worn. The bed linens were worn and did not look very clean. There was no privacy, it was necessary to keep the blinds drawn the entire time while in the room. The lighting was dim and inadequate for dressing/makeup. There was no hair dryer in the room, and when I requested one I was asked to come to the front desk (...having just emerged from the shower! How inconvenient!) The front desk staff was basically unresponsive when we requested a taxi... the taxi never showed up and we were late for a wedding. The least they could have done was warn us at the the time we put the request in that it might be difficult to get a taxi. We ended up having to drive at the last minute. For the price we paid ($250/night) the Motel 6 would have offered a better value.

I am the \"newcomer\" to the traveling party, coming for six years to this wonderful oasis; my sister and friends have been coming to Eden House for ten. If you are looking for a location that is a destination in itself to recharge, relax and reinvigorate, Eden House is for you. As other reviewers have elaborated, the proximity of the hotel to great food, and walking distance to downtown is a huge plus. The rooms are spotless, and the fact that they are a \"green\" hotel is appreciated. The meticulous attention paid to landscaping creates a lush, tropical, private hideaway that makes it difficult to return to the often-snowy Northeast. Mike Eden takes the time to make his guests feel like family, whether discussing the newest Christopher Moore book or comparing pictures of grandchildren. Elizabeth's tireless energy keeps the mechanics of Eden House running smoothly in an engaging, graceful way. The staff is friendly, and go out of their way to make sure guests have a wonderful experience. My appreciation of their expertise was underscored on our early January trip this year, when a group of disruptive guests were managed in a quick, professional, respectful way. Eden House, in my opinion, embodies the \"Old Key West\" live-and-let-live experience. The \"wild-and crazy party-all-night\" atmosphere is not what Eden House is all about.

This is a tiny room on the main balcony with no space to breathe and traffic of other guests passing all day and night in both front and back of room. I felt as if I was in a youth hostel and couldn't relax at all. There is no safe and the bathroom also tiny. We had no balcony space of our own and the wi fi didn't work in the room. All this would be fine if the room was cheap but we were spending the type of money we would have paid for 5 star accommodation and it just was not worth it. The room is clean however, and the location good. There is no food in the hotel and breakfast next door in the hotel restaurant was delicious but very pricey. The bike rentals are good but don't come to this hotel if you expect to walk everywhere as it is a bit far from the main drag. Finally, we found the staff cold and unfriendly. We were given advice about both snorkeling and restaurants which was inaccurate. When I suggested this to the girl on the desk, she was cold and snooty rather than apologetic which I again did not appreciate. This hotel rather spoilt an otherwise magical vacation in Florida. I do not recommend it and think they have become complacent because of previous good publicity. I actually am not sure I even believe that all previous reviews are genuine.

We stayed in 504 upfront upstairs in a loft because we had three people ,but with the lofts if your older you have to go up and down a spiral staircase and no bathroom upstairs!!!But we had a great street view with a swing. Some of the older rooms are in the back, ask the square footage some rooms are very small they have a two bedroom apt the larger rooms go fast. This place is what Key West is all about. Great pool and hot tub remember there is a live webcam so LADIES KEEP YOUR LEGS CLOSED!! The staff is awesome!! Everyone is friendly that is staying there, there is a grill to cook on, quiet areas for relaxing in a hammock. Get to happy hour get early if you want a seat by the pool, most rooms have a refrigerator and a microwave and plates and silverware,cups, coffee and tea is served downstairs and maybe fruit , there is a restaurant on property we did not get to try it but around the corner is a great bakery and sandwich shop Old Town Bakery they open early so you can wake walk down and get a delicious muffin, croissant, fresh baked bread and bring it back to your room and sit out by the pool and relax. Look for the coupon on the Key West website for the free bike rental, we had a great time on the bikes it was much easier that walking and taking a cab is great and cheaper than the bicycle cabs. Have a Great time and enjoy Key West, go off the beaten path and see what Key West is all a bout there is so much more to see and eat and do then Duval Street. Don't forget to eat at Blue Heaven make a reservation to get a good seat out side, the best food. Willie T's is fun with the music and the food is not bad right next door to the coach store.Once you stay at the Eden House it will be the only place you will ever want to stay at in Key West.

Overall, the management did nothing to offend me; nor did I feel an overwhelming sense of value or comfort. We went at one of the priciest and busiest times of the year, but I think $300+ a night for our room was still steep. I would advise new couples or those squeamish about privacy to stay away from the \"Small Deluxe\" since you will get the barest hint of bathroom privacy--a shutter-style door and a toilet 4 feet from the bed. No dresser or closet in these rooms--you have to live out of a suitcase the entire time. And while their materials clearly say, \"this isn't a bed and breakfast,\" I don't think a quick run by one of the many staff to pick up some bananas and bagels would kill them. The pool area, lobby, parking, and common areas are way too small to accomodate the number of guests. On another note, Eden House seems to shy away from marketing itself to gays and lesbians. No Pride flag here. Their extensive lobby brochures collection contains no literature about the gay-themed or gay friendly options in town--an omission that was mirrored in the makeup of the guests, which seemed more Carnival cruise than adult vacation destination. I found it odd to be in a town teeming with LGBT visitors and residents yet seemingly the only ones staying in our guest house. Pros: good location; good restaurant, Azur, next door; mostly friendly staff (if you don't mind the occasional grump working the night shift or people who don't look you in the eye).

One is on the day of our arrival we were a couple hours early and was informed that the room wasn't ready yet but was invited to a tour which was thoughtful. During the tour we were showed where our room was and a staff member was in there attending to it. After the tour my wife and I want to get some lunch and returned about an hour later with lunch in hand. We figured we would sit back by our room at the tables by our door, when we turned the corner we say a staff member just standing in the room watching the tv. Didn't catch his name but he wore ankle weights and had long blound hair. I think we kind of stardled him. Before we finished our sandwiches we were brought our keys. After entering we noticed that the toulet was not flushed, odd!! I would of gave the room a \"10\" if he would have put a little more effort into cleaning it. \"08\" on the room being clean. The only other thing I can think of was the tiny ants trough out the room, I know it's a tropical island but you can manage them guys easly with some spray. Don't know if they bite but my wife got bite up pretty good. Don't worry, did an inspection of the mattress and found nothing found :) . But the rest of the staff was great and they made it all worth wild and thats why I would stay there again. One even stopped pool side and chatted for 10 or 15 miniutes and hooked us up with the places to eat. Try next door for breakfast, awsome.

And although the lobby is not air conditioned, the rooms are. There is fresh fruit put out in the morning, and coffee 24 x 7.

The rooms are all a little different We stayed in a room with a queen bed and refrigerator (and that refrigerator comes in mighty handy to keep drinks cold). The room was air conditioned and had a ceiling fan. The only real oddity / annoyance was the lack of a fan in the bathroom to help with the steam. But even that was ok as the sink and mirror were outside the wet room (toilet and shower). There is no dresser or closet. But there are shelves, a luggage rack, and hooks with hangers. You don't really want a dresser or closet in the Keys anyway...they would just get too musty. The hotel has bicycles to rent, but we didn't bother. Eden House is within easy walking distance of Duvall, Mallory Square, dive and fishing charters, etc. One note...the time we went (the week after Labor Day) is hot, humid, and the start of the off season. As such, some restaurants and shops close until October. We had wanted to try the Azur restaurant associated with the hotel, but it was closed.

It was the Eden House. From the moment we were greeted at the front desk and offered a cold soda or beverage, the hospitality was over the top. No matter what our need, the staff accomodated. The kindness of people like Ryan ( the evening hotel clerk and all around guy Friday) was only surpassed by the incredible natural beauty of the property. Artistic porches, gazebos, tree-house like apartments, and hammocks were all nestled among the flowering trees and Queen/King Palms. Our room was spacious, with a darling loft with a spiral staircase for access where the children escaped away from the rest of the world. I found my own solace on the porch swing just outside the living room area (visible through the many windows that let natural light in). There were several stained glass windows throughout, and it was hard to believe I was actually staying in such luxurious surroundings. The Air Conditioning worked to perfection. The pool was a work of art (literally), and Happy Hour at the hot tub was delightful. We also were treated to a free barbecue complete with home-made deviled eggs and potato salad for the July 4th holiday. A treat was breakfast at the cafe next door, Azul, where we had Portugues French toast (hint; it has pears and sugared pecans). You could also order Eggs Benedict with just about any type of seafood that you could think of. The Eden House staff were able to recommend additional best tasting, most colorful, and most fun places to eat in town. Incidentally, the hotel is in the historic district, and we were able to walk to everywhere, including Mallory Square for the sunsets The only drawback was that the pool towels seemed to be in short supply; the laundry was always running. That is a complement to the hotel, however, as the guests really enjoyed the amazing pool. By the time we left, we felt like we were saying good-bye to friends, and we hope to come stay there every time we are in the Keys. One other note; although there were plenty of couples staying there, we were not the only family staying there as well. It was particularly meaningful to my 22 year old niece (who found your hotel online), who is still searching a bit for the \"meaning of life\", and the week-end helped her to realize she was special, and had family.

Whether it be for directions to get somewhere or even a suggestion, they are happy to help. There are several types of rooms there and ours albeit somewhat small, was kept very clean and we found we did not lack in space at all. We chose a room without a tv which kept us from wasting precious time in our room and propelled us out to the pool area. They have a free happy hour by the pool where Richard takes extra care to serve the guests with drinks - all the while cultivating a social atmosphere amongst the same group. Some of the best restaurants/ bars/ must see spots were places learned of while hanging out by the pool with long time patrons of the Eden House. Another thing that appealed to us was they try to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if possible at the Eden House but they never sacrifice customer quality or service in doing so.

Was just as much fun as it was in July 2007 when I was there last with my husband and two other friends celebrating our anniversaries. The place is so homey and cozy and the tropical gardens surrounding the pool area were as beautiful as ever! We stayed in the 1st Floor Couch House with the private jacuzzi and it was very clean and roomy. We had a bedroom with a queen bed and the sofa was a sleeper with a very comfortable air pillow mattress and it is just a comfy as the queen bed was. It had an extra large bathroom that was perfect with a big walk-in shower and two vanity sinks and with four ladies trying to get ready we had plenty of room to spread out. Staff is excellent there. We especially enjoyed the happy hour with our favorite bartender Richard mixing tropical drinks for us each day at four o'clock. Just like last time it didn't take long to meet the fellow Eden House visitors and there was another large group celebrating a 60th birthday as well as us with my sister's 50th! We had a great time hanging out at the pool in the late afternoon taking a rest from all the hustle and bustle of Duvall Street and the fairly warm temps for May and even making new friends too! Duvall street is a few blocks away with all its late night entertainment, etc. but not a bad stroll and the wharf area is even closer where you can enjoy good food and entertainment as well. Just a couple blocks down from Eden House. If you go to Key West....there are fancier and more expensive places, etc. but if you want a comfortable place to relax and unwind the Eden House is the best! You get personal service, friendly staff and the make you feel at home from the minute you arrive until you leave. Our plane wasn't scheduled to leave until 5:30 PM and they will allow you store your luggage in a secure area even after we checked out at 11AM and hang out by the pool until we had to get ready to leave and they offer you a shower area so you can refresh before you have to go to the airport. Flying directly into and out of Key West airport is great if you have seen the keys all the way down from Miami and getting in to Key West airport is a breeze compared to waitin in long lines at Miami airport. Called a cab at 4PM and were at airport in a few minutes. if you start early you can find some fabulous airfares directly into Key West from Atlanta which saves you the extra time of having to rent a car to and from Miami and assures you a easier flight home and allows you to stay in paradise a bit longer.

Some things that stick out in my mind: The hotel: What a unique place. Again, more funk. The landscaping and pool are stunning. We stayed in the lower conch house, and had one of the larger rooms on the property so we didn't run into the smallish rooms. But as many others have commented, they make it clear on the website that some rooms are small. The grounds are very well kept and clean. I loved the funny signs all over the property....just be sure to not leave your children unattended..... The amenities: This really helps set Eden House apart. Just so you get an idea...free sunscreen \"bar', free umbrellas for a rainy day, free fruit in the morning, free cocktail hour with mixed drinks and delicious watermelon in the afternoons, and on, and on... The staff: I only had the pleasure of talking to Rich and Stephanie during our stay, but if they represent the rest of the staff, what a group. From the beers at check-in to helping with pretty much anything during our stay...they are a great group of folks. Rich makes some mean drinks during cocktail hour (even though he had a bad experience with Gin as a young lad...), and Stephanie knows how to pick some awesome poolside tunes. \"Genuine\" is the best way I can describe all the staff I ran into, and that is a real treat as a traveler, to feel like the staff cares about how your stay is going. I will be going back to Eden House in my future Key West travels. This isn't a chain resort that is immaculate, and it doesn't claim to be.

I had a porch swing on my own private porch. To get to the room, you crossed a small brdge over the Koi pond to reach it. Really pretty. Plus my door was a straight view to the front desk. Good for security being a solo traveler. Had lunch at Azur. Excellent. Yellow snapper sandwich and orzo salad and a mimosa. walked the 5 or blocks to Duval street in no time to visit a walgreens and pick up some supplies, not allowed in a carry on bag. As the dramamine wore off.. the worse I started to feel. Went to bed early. Spent the next morning at the pool. Had a chair under some palm trees next to the waterfall. Really was great.

Like all hotels in Key West, I find it a bit overpriced. We paid $306 for a deluxe room that is very small. The room had a terrible smell that we couldn't pinpoint. It seemed to come from the air conditioning unit. Otherwise, the room and bathroom were very clean. The amenities include a fridge, TV and phone. If you need a hair dryer, you need to ask for one at the front desk. The hotel is extremely charming, the pictures show exactly how the hotel looks like. It is a bit removed from the beach, but this means that it is also quiet. It is a very nice walk to the beach or main tourist attractions, houses and gardens are beautiful. If you prefer, you can also rent bikes directly at the hotel. The pool is on the smaller side, a perfect fit for the hotel architecture. There is a restaurant next door. Only had breakfast there and it was perfect (as a guest at the Eden House you receive a 10% discount). Near the reception there is a computer, lots of books, magazines and board games. They also have plenty of sun lotion for you to use, should you have forgotten yours. The hotel operates on a green policy, which is nice to know.

If you chose to have the Porter service deliver your bags, they are waiting for you at the port. There were a few delightful unanticipated surprises that made the stay even smoother. We only had night available for us, because it was a spontaneous weekend getaway. The online booking required a two night minimum stay.

But we see that just about everyone else is giving its glorious praise so we figured our little plan was futile. Now we will join in the praise! You see, we live on the left coast and we still fly across the country to spend a few days here just about every Spring. The grounds are beautiful with lush gardens and hideaway hammocks. The rooms are very attractive without the cookie-cutter layout of chain hotels. When our taxi drops us at the door we feel that we are at our new home - that is a tropical home. The pace is about as laid back as one could imagine. Get up, have coffee, walk a couple of blocks to Harpoon Harry's for a huge breakfast, walk to the wharf and visit the sea turtles and manatees and head back in time to catch the best sun rays of the day and Eden House's 80 something degree pool and hot tub. Then at 4 o'clock comes the pool side Happy Hour. Then more sun rays and some great conversation with our like minded lazy co-inhabitants of this peaceful nirvana invoking garden. Then the taxing time of the day befalls when decisions must be made as to where to dine this evening. Then comes the quiet. No loud frat boy parties allowed here - Mike Eden, the owner and proprietor of Eden House, runs a quiet and very peaceful establishment - just the sounds of the crickets and the rental scooters zipping down Fleming Street. Then sleep. Other guests have described the details of Eden House more eloquently than I, so I will leave you to their descriptions.

We were pleasantly surprised to find that it was even better than our expectations. The front-desk staff was very friendly -- morning, afternoon, and night. They gave us very helpful advice on where to eat, which beach we would enjoy, and gave us directions and called cabs for us to get to our destinations, even providing us with maps of the area. At check-in, we were given a tour of the facilities, and it was absolutely gorgeous. The pool area is fun, but not too loud, and there is a happy hour in the late afternoon with free cocktails that we partook of. There was also a hot tub, which is a nice little luxury many hotels don't have. The room we stayed in, with two single beds and a private bathroom, was not very large -- a little more on the cozy side. If you are traveling with children, I believe they have larger options, but our vacation was not intended to be spent in a hotel room, so it was perfect for us. There was also nice tv if you have a little time to kill, but we never used it. Instead, we appreciated the mini fridge and microwave they provided. The beds were also very comfortable, and it was extremely quiet all day and night, even with the busy activity that hotels usually experience at check-out in the morning. To me, peace and quiet is one of my highest priorities in a hotel, and Eden House's quiet hours rule is very effective and reasonable. In addition, we found the hotel to be very clean and pleasant. The tile floors were nicely kept, the bed linens and towels were very clean, and in general the hotel was very tidy. A computer was available for guests' use, and they even had a large selection of sunscreens and tanning lotions at hand for beach and pool excursions -- now that's looking out! They also provided complimentary coffee and tea in the mornings, and a 20% off card to the Azur restaurant next door, which was very lovely and conveniently located. Overall, we loved the Eden House.

The bed is reason enough for me to come back right away...) and they do offer a range of choices for rooms depending on how big you want and if you need a TV/Fridge, or etc. The grounds are amazing, more like your own yard if you lived in paradise rather than a hotel property, really. With lush tropical plants, palm trees, koi ponds, pool, jacuzzi, hammocks, porch swings, great music, and free happy hour, really, what else could you want?? They'll also set you up with dining recommendations, reservations, bookings for charters, etc. What I can't quantify is how you'll feel staying here. We stayed at EH 7 years in a row, and then haven't been back since Jan '06 because we've been busy having kids (and how that kills the travel budget). When we arrived last weekend, it was truly like coming home. Not much had changed, except new beds, furniture, some new faces at the desk, new TV in the lobby and rooms (I assume...we didn't want one in ours). The relaxed and funky vibe was just as prevalent as it has always been, and the complimentary beer at check in actually stepped up a little in quality as well! We saw our favorite \"international sanitation engineer\" almost immediately after arriving, Pasha, and she remembered us from years ago, and seemed genuinely glad to see us, like a long lost friend. That feeling is what you get when you stay at (and return to, like you will want to) the Eden House.

We've enjoyed sleeping in 3 of the types of rooms they offer from the semi-private shared bathroom to the private room to the Loft type room. Every year we leave super thrilled. If you're looking for a fancy schmancy hotel, forget it. The Eden House is not meant for the high maintenance type. Rest assured, The EH provides a clean, beautiful, friendly spot to lounge near a pristine pool equipped with a cascading waterfall, hammocks, beautiful foliage and COMPLIMENTARY happy hour. Who could go wrong? The joke among the friends I travelled with was \"what time is it?\" response \"who cares!\" response \"we can't miss happy hour!\" This year 4 of us stayed at the EH. We shared a bathroom between 2 semi private rooms. This set up would be ideal for any 4-some looking to save a buck who only needs a place to rest their head before enjoying the sun & activities on the island. Although it was tricky to coordinate shower times before heading out at night, the convenient \"public\" shower served its purpose. Plenty of room to shave the legs or rinse off before heading out on the town. The shower is impeccably clean and right across the hall is a private toilet with a sink. I cannot rave enough about the staff, every year I am impressed with how nice and easy going they are. The 4 of us got to know Ryan & Gina- the day clerks- who helped us out immensly. Rent bikes, its the easiest way to get around, and conveniently enough, the EH offers bike rentals with your stay. I could speak volumes about what a great place the Eden House is but I could never do it any justice. Do yourself the favor and enjoy Key West by booking a trip and staying there.

Lauderdale. Looking for a quaint accommodation in Key West that could provide a central location, with easy walking/bike riding to Duval Street, we found Eden House\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and WOW, were we glad we did! Eden House is a guest house style of accommodation located in the Old Town area of Key West. It was built in the mid 1920s (but has been renovated, of course!) and is one of just a handful of Green Lodging properties on Key West. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an easy walk to Duval as well as the Seaport and Mallory Square, the perfect spot to view Key West\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sunset. Eden House rents bicycles on-site, and while we had planned to rent them, we found that it was just as easy to walk around town. We also had a rental car since we had driven to Key West from south Florida, but really only used the car once after arriving to Eden House. Eden House provides limited parking, though it was ample while we were there. July is considered low season, so we had no challenges finding parking. During high season, I can see that parking may be an issue though there is plenty of street parking around Eden House as well. The staff at Eden House is among the most friendly we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve encountered during our travels. In advance, they provided us with a list of sights to see, things to do, and places to eat while on our drive from Miami to Key West. We chose to stop at the Key Deer Refuge Nature Trail, just slightly off our Highway 1 path, but worth the detour. We saw 3 deer just wandering around, not afraid of us or traffic. Street signs in this area are clearly marked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Watch for deer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not kidding! The speed limit is 15 mph for good reason. Eden House has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153house cat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd named Miss Kitty. Miss Kitty lounges freely in the entrance and the front porch of Eden House, and loves to be rubbed. She purrs and just hangs out, giving a true \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel for the place. Our room was a Large Deluxe with a porch swing out front. The room was clean and just as described on their website and in their email communication. Our room was on the side that bordered Fleming Street, but we never heard any noise or were bothered by our location. The only drawback is that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free Wi-Fi was out of range for us. Not a big deal though as we liked having the corner room that was private and just went to the pool if we needed Wi-Fi. The grounds at Eden House are lush with native plants and flowers from Florida, and provide a nice addition to the pool area which hosts a daily Happy Hour from 4 to 5pm. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss that! They even provide complimentary sunscreen. The 3 nights/4 days we spent on Key West were educational (there is so much history on the island!), fun, and relaxing at the same time. Genuinely friendly residents greeted us on sidewalks and along the pier. We were lucky to strike up a couple of lengthy conversations with locals who told us their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of how they ended up on the island, providing some encouragement and guidance toward our goal of someday living out our lives on Key West.

It was the most expensive room we've rented in ages, but given the general prices for good locations on Key West that weekend, it was worth a try. Staff was polite, helpful and down to earth. We arrived relatively early and got one of the few on-site free parking spots. So we left the car there and allowed ourselves to sink into the Key West + Eden House atmosphere. Upon arrival we got a complimentary beer each. In the evening there is a Happy Hour where you can help yourself at the bar (vodka, rum, gin, juices, soda, ice, nuts etc. was available), free of charge. At the pool. Sweet. On 4th of July there was even a BBQ at the poolside with burgers, hot dogs, chips, which was really a nice addition to the Happy Hour that day :) The place itself is nice and cozy, and relatively small. The pool was perfectly OK, though probably not the biggest you have seen. There is even a jacuzzi. There are also hammocks, swing benches and pool chairs for you to relax in. At night, the hotel policy is \"If we can't hear you, we can't see you\", which is sort of perfect for everyone. You can take a night swim or do whatever you want as long as you are not waking up the other guests. We had a small room on the second floor. Certainly not the size and standard you would expect for this price in most other towns in the US, but we were not disappointed, since we had studied the room details on the web site before booking. The room had a queen bed, some shelves, a sink, a shower (and various soaps) and a toilet. Not much room to move around, but we managed (more than a couple of days in such a tiny room is not recommended, I guess). There was even a fan above the bed in addition to the room's AC, which we appreciated (we don't like leaving the AC on too much during the night). We figured that a large percentage of the cost of our room was payment for for the happy hour, pool, water, food, service etc. and not the room standard. This way of thinking made it possible to say to ourselves that it was worth the expense. It was possible to rent bicycles from the hotel (price example: $10 for 12 hours), so we did. This is very much recommended, it is a good way to get around Key West. Extra kudos to the hotel staff for providing a water cooler for everyone to use (no need to go buy those water bottles for once), sun lotions, for taking care of postcards/stamps, and answering questions we had. There was no breakfast/dining in-house (apart from the 4th of July BBQ), but the Azul restaurant next door was available (you get a 20% discount as Eden guest). We tried eating breakfast there once; the food was very good, prices on the high side. Eden House is perfect for couples / friends looking for an alternative to the big chain hotels.

We have also stayed at the Island City House, Santa Maria Suites, and rented on Key West, but we always seem to keep coming back to the Eden House (though the mentioned places were lovely as well). We have stayed in the loft deluxe four times and this past time went for an apartment. I really liked having the (very basic) kitchen in the apartment for a longer stay. The Eden House has a funky vibe that some may not like, but we love. There is always incense burning and hammocks to be had, and the focus is on relaxation and/or alcohol, depending on the time of day. The low-end rooms are rather basic (like hostel type rooms, but hey, they are cheap and clean!), so if you enjoy spending a lot of time in your room relaxing, I recommend upgrading to a deluxe or apartment room. The staff is (usually) lovely, and the owner, Mike, is cool. Everyone is always happy to help you. The residential setting is great, and the hotel rents bikes with big comfy seats - this is a must for getting around KW. You do not need a scooter or a golf cart, KW is completely flat so even the most out of shape will never be out of breath. We also highly recommend Azur, the restaurant next door, for any meal but especially for breakfast. Get a coupon for 20% off at the front desk. Great fresh Med-inspired options and lots of cool things (like variations on eggs benedict) that you have never seen before and should try. So those are most of the pros, now for the cons. The beds suck. Mike, if you are reading this, PLEASE get new beds. The existing ones are way too hard (well, some of you may like that, but we, and the people we have spoken with about it, don't). This is not a deal breaker for us as we love the place otherwise. The pool area can fill up with people quickly (it prob isn't big enough). Every hotel has its own culture, and a lot of people who stay at EH seem to hang out by the pool all day, or at least reserve chairs all day. Awesome if you like that, but not the greatest when you are coming back from other things and want do jump in the pool. We go to Fort Zach to swim mostly.

So very close to all the main attractions yet quiet when you need to get some shut eye. I personally am a huge fan of renting a bike during my stay and riding where I want to go. You can rent from Eden House if you desire. You can also walk - I just prefer a bike. The room I was in this past time was a private room - no tv, fridge, microwave and had a double bed. A friend did stay with me so it was a little cozy, but the price was right. It's amazing how much some of the hotels cost down there. One thing to be aware of is the shower in the private rooms is in the bedroom part. I'm sure this would be fine for couples, but a little awkward for friends. The room had plenty of space for our things too. There was a desk with shelves above and also a bookcase with I think 5 shelves on it. We did spend one day in the pool - they provide towels and floaties/noodles if you need them. They have happy hour every day and I believe this includes beer and I know there is vodka too. Outside of happy hour you can purchase beer for $1. Pretty cheap for KW! Our rooms were clean and staff was pleasant.

I would have given it 5 stars but there are a few minor issues that prevented that. There is no 4.5 so it gets a 4 from me.

Upon arrival we were greatly by friendly and helpful woman at the front desk who offered us a free drink (beer or soda) which we came back for after we got settled. The woman who greeted us and checked us in took us for a brief tour and showed us some of the amenities which included: free use of assorted sunscreens, a spring water cooler on the porch that we used frequently, the wonderful pool, hot tub, hammock area, and every day from 4-5pm \"happy hour\" with free self serve mixed drinks by the pool. On Fri and Sat this included live music entertainment. Beers were available for purchase for $1. Wow! Another highlight was that they rent bikes right there, we paid $10 for 12 hour rental and got around key west this way. They also rented for 24 hours or longer. The setting was beautiful with little fountains, lots of plants and flowers, lots of shady areas to get out of the sun, and tons of porch chairs, swings, hammocks and other areas to kick back and relax. The guests were friendly and communed around the pool each day. All of this with a great price means a trade off, at least on the room we booked which was very small, even with with a double bed. No closet or storage for furniture other than hangers and hooks on the wall, plus some good shelving. No alarm clocks or phone in the room. None of these things mattered for our purpose and we knew this coming in, so no surprise. Only downside was it could be a little loud occasionally (since we were right at the pool, and we had to get new sheets as the ones they put on for day 2 were dirty. The hotel has different room price points and some are larger with more amenities and even include kitchenette areas. If we go back to Key West this is where we'll stay, we loved it.

I personally believe 4 stars is more than enough in most cases, and five should be reserved for only THE best combination of quality and value. I would give EH about a 3.8 score. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained, the staff were all friendly, and the location is fine. On the downside would be the cost as I do not feel it is fully justified. Then again I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t own anything in Key West, so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what it costs to own/maintain a place there. Full details are below. The Room The room we had, 503, was fine. Nothing wrong with it in any way, but nothing I would drool over either. I saw some of the other rooms that other users have described, and ours was certainly an improvement over those. It was a 2nd floor unit, and it had a loft bedroom. It has a dorm-fridge, full-size coffee maker, micro, toaster, and ice-mixer, all located around a small sink. It had a minimal number of utensils, and the basic dinnerware. It also had an LCD TV with expanded cable (a few pay channels), a pull-out couch (which according to a sign had an inflatable mattress\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6pump in the closet), and a small patio that overlooked the pool area. A spiral staircase led to the loft, which had a single queen bed. WiFi was included. A little slow but worked fine. The bathroom was fine, with an ample shower. We had no problems with hot water in the shower, but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get hot water in the bath sink unless I ran it a long time. Could be I was just doing it wrong\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I found the control confusing. The overall room size was fine. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually any coffee table, which added to the open feel, but some might not appreciate the inability to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153put your feet up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The deck is very small, so only 2 people max. The railings seem to be built to very strict safety standards (which is probably required for Key West partyers!), so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not actually easy to sit and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153look out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as much of the view is blocked by railings and balusters. Still, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very nice. I see some have complained about the beds. I actually slept fine, which is rare. We have a king at home, and I move a lot, so for me to stay still in a hotel bed is a minor miracle. The bed was very firm however, so hopefully you like it that way. Of course the booze consumption could have contributed to my sleeping like a baby. I was not disturbed by noise. It *is* Key West, so you will get the occasional Harley going by, or a delivery truck. The A/C isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t central, so you get the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadvantage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of constant humming noise that, for me, helps to negate other outside noise. But again, my blood-alcohol level may have contributed to my ignorance of external noise. I certainly did not find the noise from other guests to be an issue. Smoking We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re convinced that Key West is a smoker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paradise. It seems to be the local pastime. So when we come here we just expect it. The problem with a place like EH is that the overall layout pretty much means that if one person smokes, we all smoke. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just nowhere for the smoke to go\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it tends to drift around and linger. It was a game at first\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d smell the smoke and think someone was right below us, but then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d realize they were across the way. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to matter where they were. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ironic twist of having non-smoking rooms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once you force smokers outside, then we all partake. So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a reality. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad, just realize that you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily escape it. Then again if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a smoker, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do just fine. The Staff Never met Mike, at least not that I recall. We mostly dealt with the front-desk staff, and they were fine. They always seemed to be busy, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see them keep a smile on their face amidst the constant onslaught. I give them high remarks for this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6had anyone been less than friendly, it would have immediately made the place seem to be more expensive than it was worth, if you understand what I mean. But that was not the case at all. Everyone was very friendly, very helpful, and very patient. Kudos. The Location We have stayed at the lower end of Duval before, and the long walk to the north end can be a slog sometimes. But even though EH is somewhat far away as well, you can very quickly get to the waterfront just a couple blocks to the north. Once there we found the walk to downtown to be nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it just seemed to go by faster. So I think location is fine. It gave us plenty of opportunity to explore side streets at night. We did run into some local guys now and then who looked like they have seen the inside of a few too many bottles, but they were always fine. Loved this one guy\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6said hi to him and asked how he was doing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he just smiled and said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCasual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a slow drawl. We plan to steal this response for our own use! Pool and Grounds The pool was fine. Only time it was ever crowded was at happy hour, which we never took advantage of anyway. There is also a Jacuzzi. Way too hot for us to use that puppy, but plenty of other people hopped in. Some reviewers complained of the overall size of the pool area, and that there were not enough lounge chairs. Guess I could see this as an issue, but it never seemed to be a problem while we were there. The grounds were beautiful. Two fish ponds, plenty of plants, etc. People were fascinated by a family of woodpeckers in one of the trees\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6bet a few hummingbird feeders would be well received. Dining There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no on-site restaurant per-se. Azur is a property on the grounds that does breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but it is leased by a separate group. We had breakfast and dinner. There was a 20% off discount card in the lobby of EH we used for breakfast (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also good for lunch, but not dinner). All our meals were excellent. Expect dinner to be pricey but worth it. The only hassle was they sat a couple right next to us when the place wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even full\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6if you guys read this, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t EVER do that!!! Misc The crowd was mostly older. I would not consider this a place for children. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beer at check in is a nice marketing ploy, but for the cost of our stay it certainly was not free of course, and I would have preferred a very chilled Sam Adams (maybe next time?). And of course they do have the free happy hour. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vouch for this. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear anyone complaining, but I am sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no top shelf stuff involved. They have reasonable bike rentals right there on the property. They offer free coffee and stuff in the lobby, and I *think* it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there all the time.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, KY.", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful experience, as always\u201d", "Author": "crochetcpa", "ReviewID": "UR63306516", "Content": "We are repeat travelers to the Eden House...and it never fails to amaze us how happy we are each and every time with our stay there.

No drawers available for clothing, but open shelves instead. I prefer to put things in drawers to keep it looking more tidy, but this system worked. We had windows that opened, an air conditioner and ceiling fan. No heat, but with any luck in Key West, that won't be needed anyway. The hotel is in a flight path for airplanes arriving at the airport. With the windows closed, the planes could not be heard. The bathroom was larger than I'd anticipated. I'd expected a tiny shower, but it was decently sized. It would have been nice to have a shelf in the bathroom large enough to hold personal care items. Only one very small shelf was mounted and that was where they provided tissues and cups. There was a separate trash can for recyclables, which I was glad to see and used appropriately. Until I saw housekeeping co-mingle trash from that can and the regular can one day! Oops, nice thought, but obviously not practical from the housekeeper's point of view. We did reuse towels and sheets throughout the stay, but those that we wanted replaced were. On the property were many comfortable verandas, with porch swings, chairs and tables. A secluded area in back had hammocks, although I found them to be hung a bit too low. The pool was small, sparkling and pristine. There was a hot tub, but we didn't use it. WiFi is available, but limited in area. We couldn't access from our room, but could from the library area and a back veranda. Every afternoon, the hotel provided a happy hour by the pool with music, drinks and a light snack. There is a small gift shop. Bicycles are available to rent and will be discounted if you rent one for multiple days. We asked the desk to reserve tickets for us for a cruise, and they were happy to oblige.

Total cost came to $979 (inc taxes) so $244.75 a night. Its quite a distance from the pier - a good 15 / 20 min walk but they have free parking. We noticed that the place looked a bit tired at check-in. I dont mind 'kooky' / bohemian but this place just looks run-down. We were shown to a room on the ground floor, just next to the pool and informed that they have 'happy hour' drinks outside our room at 5.30pm. The room doors all open outwards - which goes to show just how tiny the rooms are. The bed (no more than a queen size) was pushed against the wall (pet hate). There was no actual bathroom: just a sink on the wall at the foot of the bed, a toilet in a cupboard and the shower cubicle opened right into the room. No TV / radio. No wardrobes etc. Just a small desk with a rail & some hangers. Bedding was very old and musty. The only window in the room was next to the door and looked out onto the walkway where people were sunbathing and would gather for happy hour so if we wanted any privacy we wouldnt have been able to open the blinds - ever. We complained and were moved to a room upstairs - this room was just as bad. We noticed in the guestbook that the owner would be happy to give a full refund to anyone who didnt want to stay so we cancelled, got our money back and went to The Westin which is right on the pier, gave us a beautiful room 4 times the size of the one at Eden House with white fluffy robes etc - all for $305 a night.

There is also coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the lobby 24 hours which our children greatly enjoyed (hot chocolate, that is!). The staff is the secret weapon of this hotel. They all go out of their way to be helpful. For example, when we were trying to rent bikes and the island was running short on children's bikes, they were able to find us the last one available. There was no one who did not greet us with smiles, and this was beyond the front desk crew, this was truly everyone we encountered. I was a bit worried about how our children would be viewed by the other guests but they were treated so kindly and warmly that I got over this worry in a hurry. Our children are well behaved but this is a predominately adult hotel. I realized quickly that this was not going to be an issue. Our kids were able to use the pool, hot tub and wander around the grounds without any worries they were in anyone's way. The location is perfect, walking and or biking distance to every place we wanted to go, we were able to park our car the first day and not use it again until we left.

Duvall St. and Old Town were only a few blocks away in either direction, but Eden House was far enough from the hubhub that you still get a true taste of the \"laid back Keys\".

Do your research on the web site to clearly understand what kind of accommodations you are booking... which you should do with any hotel! EH is a charming old hotel and the room sizes reflect that.

The Eden House has a nice pool area, an upper sun deck and a complimentary \"Happy Hour\". The staff is so friendly and they really go out of their way to make you feel welcome. A complimentary beverage (beer!) was given to us when we checked in. They took the time to give us a quick tour of the property too. I can't say enough about this place. It's a great place to stay if you want to be away from Duvall Street (to avoid the noise), but yet close enough to walk or bike there when you want to enjoy the fun! I would highly recommend this hotel to family and friends and I look forward to staying there again!", "Date": "August 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NEW ENGLAND", "Title": "\u201cTropical Paradise\u201d", "Author": "TRAVELERSNewEngland", "ReviewID": "UR36085982", "Content": "Beautiful & quiet accomodations; waterfall; koi ponds; hammock outside our room; upon check-in the staff gave us a full tour of the facility and served us w/a complimentary beverage (nice touch); w/in 4 blocks of Duval Street; bike rentals on site; binder in our room w/write ups of great places to eat; would definitly stay there again..", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cEden House is the best!\u201d", "Author": "PK777", "ReviewID": "UR35427006", "Content": "The wife and I just got back from 4 days in KW.

Here are some highlights that I would recommend to anyone planning a visit there. Transportation: We flew in to Ft. Lauderdale which for us was much cheaper than Miami and really not that much farther away. We rented a car and drove 2 half hours to Islamorada for the night (we had a later flight). The Hampton was fine but a bit pricey and had I know how much better KW is, I probably would have finished the 4 hr drive and gone straight there. As far as the drive goes, it was neat, but not something I'd want to do more than once. We spoke to a local who suggested we fly to Ft. Myers and take a boat to KW.. no idea how much that would cost. Once we got to KW, we parked the car and didnt use it again until it was time to leave. Where to stay: We stayed at Eden House which was entirely different than the type of place we're used to staying in Florida. There was no view of the water and no beach close by. The room was small and we even shared a bathroom with the people next door! Some would view these a negatives but we would not have changed a thing. The people were incredibly nice, the other guests were adults, lots of quiet relaxation at the pool. Oh yes and the free happy hour each day is a perfect way to get ready for Duval in the evening. Eden House is amazing... check out their website edenhouse.com and do your self a favor and stay there! Things to do: We really enjoyed riding bikes all around KW. We rented them from the hotel. Most everything is just minutes away. We actually rode the entire loop around KW in about an hour and a half. Take full advantage of the quality and variety of food available. The best breakfast we had was at Blue Heaven - great food and very cool atmosphere. Same goes for lunch at B.O.'s by the marina. It's a toss up between a burger or fish sandwich. We ussually got both and split. The beer is the coldest! For dinner, you can't really go wrong. Do a search on KW dining and take your pick. Some great seafood! We took the day trip to the Dry Tortugas. It was pricey, I think around $300 for both of us plus another $40 for a tip at the end. It was totally worth it. The fort was cool, beach was nice, and snorkeling was awesome. The crew were great and food was very good. It's a full 8 hour day. Nighlife: Mallory square around 7:30pm kicks off the sunset festival. It packs a good crowd on the weekend. Check out the crazy cat guy and get a mojito from the the drink cart at the far end of the walk. At least one night go up to the top floor of the Laconcha hotel on Duval. This is really the best view of the sunset. They have a bar so go early to get a drink and a seat. We always cut through the Starbucks to get to the elevator, I'm sure there's a more direct route. You will have no trouble finding cool bars to hang out in on Duval. If you want to get off Duval, check out Louie's Backyard. They have a neat bar looking out over the water. We didnt eat there but the food looked good. As far as the beaches go.. check out Higgs or Smathers. When we were there, big dump trucks were pouring on lots of new sand (beaches are man made). There is a large concrete pier here as well. The water was pretty clear but some seaweed. We didnt spend much time around the beach but it didnt look too bad. The other beach areas are pretty small and not great for swimming. We stayed 4 nights which was ok but we were not ready to go.

Once you park it is in a very nice location for whatever you want, yet not so close to the busy streets like Duval to keep you up at night.

First we will state the positive: The happy hour is lacking as one would typically expect in a \"Guest House\", but in their favorite it was dead on with their description on their website along with the free drink at check in. Although the compound itself is beautiful.. pool, gazebo, hot tub, etc. It is just too small to accomodate the number of rooms. I know this is not a management problem, but you cannot get in or around the pool in the afternoon into the evening. The chaise loungers are all taken early in the day. There is just not enough space for all guests.(also true with parking, not enough spots for all the guests). (And don't be fooled by Mike's response, most boutique hotels, guest houses, etc accomodate each and every guest with parking on Key West, my husband and I have stayed at nearly 90% of them thus far). The week we were there it was so filled with cigarette smoke in the back compound the smoke was actually lingering under the trees and balcony canopies. Besides the smoke, the stench coming from the adjoining restaurant was nothing short of horrible. During our stay, 2 rooms checked out early due partially to this smell and partially to tiny dirty rooms. If you're paying 99bucks a night, not as big as a deal, but this place is very high priced. The street noise is constant and after speaking with other guests during our stay, you can pretty much hear it throughout the night no matter what room you are in. Now, being my husband and I own property on Key West and are down here every 6 weeks, we do have to STRONGLY disagree when personnel told us......(every place in Key West is very noisy due to the streets being so small) eh??? Onto the rooms, the are EXTREMELY small (again, same special person told us \"all rooms on Key West are small\" I am now thinking this person has probably never been out of the Eden House). Rooms were dirty...housekeeping did come each and every day, but I have no idea what they cleaned in our room (and they are some rude people). The sink area was filthy as was the floor, not dirty, just plain filthy. We have our own test to check to see if housekeeping actually cleaned the bathroom, low and behold, they did not clean thoroughly our entire stay. I know Mike try's his hardest to have that laid back Key West attitude, but when your guests are not happy and his only response is to see the \"unhappy disclosure\" on the web site, it's just not funny. I have seen the real laid back Key West attitude at many many other \"Guest Hotels\" on the Island and Mike should take some notes from his competitors. If you happen to check out of the Eden House early and go elsewhere, PLEASE mention this place, it's pretty incredible to hear what other owners responses are. Laid back is great, pompous is not. This guy just can't pull it off. Ok, in closing I will say.....after staying here and reading all the RAVE REVIEWS of this place, I can't tell you this....if you are a person that seeks a higher standard than some, this place is not for you. (keep in mind this place is expensive, I probably wouldn't mind if Mike realized this and lowered his prices to meet his standards). If you travel and are used to motels, hotel 6, truck stop Inns. that this is your kind of place. You will be giving the Eden House 4 stars!!!

Following the high recommendations from one of the other couples in our group, together, we booked three deluxe rooms at the Eden House. After calling ahead to inquire about vacancies, my wife and I and one other couple actually arrived a day early. The very accommodating and courteous staff booked us into two rooms in the upper level of the main house for one night, then moved our luggage to our new accomodations the next morning. Rooms 114, 115, and 116 were secluded on the lower level at the rear of the main house and were very comfortable. Each of the rooms, while not overly large, contained a single queen sized bed, were extremely clean, well kept, and featured very recent amenities. The new flat screen tv's w/dvd players open up additional space on top of the chest of drawers. The showers in each of the rooms had instant hot water and plenty of it. The maintenance and the cleanliness was impeccable. Not a rusted nail, flake of paint, scratched, chipped, or cracked board could be found either inside or outside our rooms. For those of us who can't quite leave work at home, cell phone coverage as well as wireless internet strength were great. Each of our rooms had it's own back porch which featured a padded porch swing and a patio table with chairs. Just off the back porch several of the many hammocks, shaded by towering palms and coconut trees, beckoned us each afternoon. As others have said, this is a quiet place to relax. This is not a headquarters for tweenage spring breakers or for a family with young children. It's designed and marketed towards couples looking for a place to spend some quiet time together and Mike Eden has created a little piece of paradise that meets that goal in spades. No ice machines or elevators outside your door. No late night party animals running through the hallways slamming doors. No neighbors waking you up through paper thin walls. Quiet time from 10pm to 10am is recognized each evening, but as the saying goes, if they don't hear you, they don't see you. The hot tub is open all night if you're quiet. The front desk is staffed 24/7 so there is always somebody available to meet your every need or wish. Each of the staff members we encountered were very helpful, informative, and very very courteous. I've never been at a hotel where the staff has had such a strong desire to fulfill your desires. The walk to and from Duval Street isn't bad, in fact, it's rather relaxing (see the theme here?) The best route leads you down to Schooner Wharf with a great look at the boats and the harbor. There is plenty of old town architecture and greenery to be seen along the way and ample amounts of food and drink to be found between the Eden House and Duval. For those staying several days, a coin laundry is only a block away. Eden House also rents bikes and has ample parking should you drive. I can't say enough about the hospitality and the accomodations.

Missing it Already\u201d", "Author": "tkjms", "ReviewID": "UR23587808", "Content": "I wish I had provided my review earlier. In addition to going in Dec '08 this was our 2nd time to Eden. First time was May '08 - we just couldn't stay away. We've been going to KW for 20 years and always rent a house or stay in a condo. Once we found this we decided no more searching for the right place - we're going to Eden every time! The staff make the difference, very welcoming and always helpful. The quiet time is great and you can still stay poolside at night if you like or on a hammock its just a peaceful time. And actually all day its like that. Thankfully when we've been there we've only seen one kid - although she was extremely loud, it wasn't bad. But I would not recommend this personally for children b/c it is a small resort and only has the pool area for them to play. Plus KW overall is an adult destination. You can rent bikes from the front desk, the taxis are easy to call, you can easily walk to Duval - about 5 blocks and of course lots of other local places around the corner. I would recommend that you ask for the details of your room when you book it. There are very small rooms at the poolside that are great if you are looking for a cheaper room and just want a bed. But those rooms are tight. There are mutliple types of rooms - private hammocks, porch areas that fit all budgets. The rooms are clean and beds really comfortable. We've stayed in room #114 which has the hammock outside and is private - plasma TV - great room (pics are attached to the view from that porch). There are three like that. I've also stayed at one of their larger rooms when we had a group and that was the 2nd floor of the cottage room #422. My only recommendation honestly for the Eden at all is that there are so many private areas and foliage, beautfiul flowers/fish, etc except when you take the steps up to go to #422. You look down into the next door area (which may be where some of the staff live - I'm not sure) and its filthy. Looks like a trailer park next to this beautiful resort and outside the windows from the downstairs cottage (don't know the room number) you can see bags of trash, misc garage items, grilles, etc. And although the trash you can see is clearly separated as being part of the \"green\" for recyclling it should be hidden. Even at home I wouldn't want to see anything like this. Its a small complaint and will certainly not keep me from recommending Eden or going again - I would just warn you if you select the cottage to close your eyes on the way upstairs. I won't stay in that room again but I think they can easily fix this with a higher fence or trash boxes. And who knows, Eden is also one of the few I've seen on Trip Advisor that respond to the reviews which I think is great so maybe they can do something soon about this. Also, the cottage is also a little louder than the other rooms b/c it is located on the side street. The trolley comes by in the morning for the local tour ringing its bell - its cute but not if you want to sleep in ;-) One of the rooms to ask about if you can get it - its always booked when we've been there is room #511! Its larger, right off the pool and lots of space inside. And also don't forget to ask when you make your reservation for a discount - sometimes during the year they give you the 4th night at 50% off or your 7th night free, never guaranteed but worth checking - depends on time of year of course. And back to the other good stuff - location, staff and the pool is just restful and beautiful. We can't wait to go back this year and bring more friends with us! Don't forget the amazing restaurant next door called Azur and you get a discount as a guest at Eden - I think it was 20% which is great and its wonderful food! While we were there the chef was also featured on the local KW tv channel. Thanks Mike for great hospitality - it was great meeting you this time too and the staff are always welcoming.

Take that how you may, it simply wasn't what I had expected from the review or the research I had done. The hotel was clean and looks fantastic. The members of staff I saw were pleasant enough and checking in was easy. The off street parking is a real bonus. I'd booked a poolside room and it was literally on the poolside. The room was compact and the bed was extremely uncomfortable and small for what I expected. It had no entertainment facilities e.g. a tv or radio except in a communal 'lounge' which was used as a corridor. The hotel has a request that quiet is observed between 10pm and 10am and I was therefore extremely disappointed to be woken at 7.30am by a suitcase being dragged along the poolside and the lively chatter of a member of staff directly outside my room.

The place just smelled \"clean\", not chemical like most hotels do. The staff was super friendly and casual, it was like staying with old friends. Their friendly suggestions on where to eat, drink, snorkel, etc. were all right on. We were 1st greeted at check-in with our choice of several kinds of drinks (both alcohol & non-alcohol); the beer choices were budweiser and miller lite, we chose one of each, they were ice cold and much appreciated after our drive from Miami. The free daily happy hour (liquors, mixers, soft drinks, and snack mix--watch out for the larger green ball in the snack mix, it is pure wasabi, and is EXTREMELY Hot) was a lot of fun, a great way to meet others staying there. The atmosphere there is so relaxing and casual. The grounds are beautiful and echo the atmosphere. There are porch swings that are part most of the accomodations there, also hammocks all around under tropical tree canopies, and waterfalls with beautiful Koi fish.

This weekend was supposed to be a little extra special and intimate for me and my girlfirend (...well...actually....my fiancee), because I was planning on proposing. So after seeing some of the excellent reviews here, I decided to give this hotel (it's not a B&B!!....because I don't like B&B's) a shot. Boy...did the Eden House deliver the wow!! When I contacted the Eden House to make my reservation, I had a brief conversation with the front desk manager, in which I mentioned how important this weekend was to me. Upon check in, the front desk knew exactly who I was and were gracious enough to give me one of their more \"secluded rooms\". The property is gorgeous. It is nestled amongst some beautiful foliage tucked a few blocks back from Duval. It's close enough to walk and far away enough to be completely peaceful. They have a beautiful pool area, countless hammocks and swings, a free happy hour, a tanning deck, and free wi-fi!! Jeez, what more could you want? The hotel also has a neighboring restaurant (Azur), where we had an EXCELLENT breakfast that we enjoyed at a 20% discount because we were Eden House guests. The hotel is VERY conscientious about its cleanliness as recycling bins and trash cans are located and labeled everywhere. The room was impeccable and greeted us with a pleasant clean and fresh smell (the first impression of smell is so very important to me in how I percieve a hotel room). So the room was immaculate. And even more astounding than that.....was the fact that even their small rooms are pretty big for Key West standards. I stayed in the \"small deluxe\" and thought maybe that it would be so small, I'd bang my knees against the wall when I woke up. Not the case. Ample room space to sleep, store your bags, change, etc. I even had the manager show us some of the larger rooms and we were astounded as to how big they were. There are many details that just shows you that the hotel is thinking. Complimentary, and variety of, suntanning products; rags (other than normal face cloths) that you can use for shoes or clean up (as not to dirty your face cloths); pool toys and inflatables; self locking doors (which I personally like); and \"un-policed\" pool hours....I believe their slogan was: \"If we can't hear you, then we can't see you!\".

The location was great. A quiet part of town, but only a 10-minute walk from the heart of Duvall and 5 minutes from the harbor walk. Rent a bike, I did, and you can cut those times by over half. While my room was small -- it was one where you had a television, microwave, refrig and own bathroom -- it fit my needs just fine, because other than to sleep, change clothes and shower, I was hardly there during my stay. I also have to commend them for the room TVs. A nice wide screen -- probably a 36-incher -- which was great for the brief time I did sit down to watch the NCAA Tournament. The front desk service was great. They were courteous and any questions I had were quickly answered and the few problems I ran into were quickly resolved. The highlight of my trip was when I asked the girls at the desk soon after my arrival if I could test ride a bike before renting one, considering it had been 25-plus years since I had ridden with any consistency. They had no problem with that -- and renting a bike was the best decision I made the entire trip. A bike is definitely the best way to get around the island. (I'm actually thinking of buying one for my own use at home, I enjoyed it so much. Imagine, exercise being fun). I also liked the at your own risk policy regarding the pool and jacuzzi. After getting back from Duvall Street at 2 a.m., it was nice to sit in the jacuzzi (although the temperature seemed to have been turned down from what it was during the day) for a little a while -- and having 1-2 more cold ones -- before hitting the sack. The only major issues I had were: 1, The pool: It was not heated and with temperatures in the 70s and gusty winds while I was there, the water was just too cold. 2, The Wi-Fi.: It did not work well. You could be sitting right next to the router and you would lose your connection. For many people, the internet is a vital part of their life - I was even using it during my stay to find place to eat/visit while I was in Key West -- and to have a poor internet hookup -- when it's supposed to be high speed -- can be a real pain. 3, One of the mornings my shower was too hot/scalding, something you can rarely complain about while staying in a hotel. But I talked to the front desk and the problem was quickly resolved. Final verdict: Eden House is a great place to stay and I could easily see myself going back.. But if you're a person who is looking to party hard (i.e., spring breakers, which are not allowed there), this is not the place for you. Even me, at the age of 43, felt a bit out of place because it seemed many of the guests never left the grounds and were the go to bed at 10 p.m and get up at 8 a.m. types rather than the get up at noon and go to bed at 4 a.m. type which I tend to be. (I work nights in my professional life), But no one complained about my nocturnal lifestyle, and staying there did keep me away from the spring breakers, which is the primary reason I'll probably be back.", "Date": "April 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset, UK", "Title": "\u201cAtmospheric!\u201d", "Author": "prusling", "ReviewID": "UR14864545", "Content": "Eden House is a beautifully-maintained traditional Keys building with excellent modern amenities close enough to the happenings of Key West but also a haven for relaxing by the pool, spa or in a hammock.

So, I decided to lay out the big bucks and go to the creme de la creme of Florida... Key West. Yes, it's true, not a cup of coffee to be found for less than $2.75 on this island, and not a steak for less than $30. However, the atmosphere, the people, the \"experience\" is worth every penny. Oh yeah, that's right... I'm supposed to be rating Eden House! Friendly, courteous, knowledgable, accomodating, ALL words we hear in the service industry and people throw around easily. Except at Eden House they really do apply! Every employee of Eden House was all of these and MORE. Not so much catering to me or any whim I may have, but more the straight \"look you in the eye\" give you real answers kind of people. From the recommendations of the local sandwich shops and fine dining establishments, they steered my vacation in all the right directions. Here's the best part... after spending those few hours each day away from the hotel grounds, it was most enjoyable to return \"home\" to Eden House. That is my experience in a nutshell. I felt like I was at home with family. You know the what I mean; like the cousin you see once or twice a year but you wish you lived closer to. First the sun deck beckons, then the pool calls out, then the hot tub is wispering your name. All of that followed up by a quick stop back at the room refridgerator for a freshening of your favorite beverage, and then back to the \"family atmosphere\" among the other guests. I was actually sad to call it a day, because of the atmosphere that was created by the staff \"family.\" Of course that's not so bad... to go to the room... with the perfect bed, welcoming air conditioning and roomy shower. Being a clean freak myself (at least my wife calls me that) I can't say enough good things about the cleanliness and organization of the whole hotel. Meeting Mr Eden several times at happy hour just seemed to top off the comfortable and inviting atmosphere that I now call \"my vacation home.\" Feel free to quote me on this, \"The Eden House is the best place to stay in all of Key West.

The Eden House grounds are sprawling compared to most Old Towne accommodations. Lavishly landscaped, we enjoyed simply sitting on the balcony facing the trees! I could have easily spent a week here, swimming in the heated pool or lounging in the jacuzzi, sunning on the sundeck, or resting and reading in one of the many hammocks. There's another nice sitting area with rocking chairs upstairs facing the road, great for people-watching. I can't express how amazing the atmosphere of this place was, very quaint, yet so detailed and varied. The hotel itself is in several different buildings, each holding rooms of various sizes. We didn't get to tour the other rooms, and ours was the bargain room, but it was more than adequate. Be warned - the room was TINY, barely big enough to fit the queen-sized bed and enormous entertainment center. But it was perfect for us, since the only time we planned to spend in the room was to be spent sleeping! We were in the last room on the second floor of the main house, so we didn't have to share a bathroom. The view from our windows was all trees - beautiful! (If you're not into tiny rooms, larger ones are available in the other buildings, including \"apartments\", \"lofts\", and \"conch houses\".) Another thing - the room was *immaculate*, as was the bathroom. And the grounds. Everything here really was perfect, and the staff was crazy friendly!

The staff is friendly and extra-helpful. The rooms are spotless. There was fresh paint in a bunch of spots. The grounds were lush and well tended. There's an in-ground jacuzzi. The hotel has a nice, funky vibe. Our fellow guest were fairly friendly and nice to talk to. Our room had a lot of good things going for it, too. Lots of space, first floor, porch right on the street. But there were a bunch of things, little things, about the place that just screamed cheap! That they were maximizing there income a penny at a time. The devil is, of course, in the details and those details made me feel like they cared more about those pennies than me. There was no breakfast, but we knew that going in. The walls in the room were so thin that we could hear our next door neighbors completely. And when I say \"hear completely,\" I mean you could sit on the commode and have a quiet conversation through the walls without raising your voice. The floors were tile, which obviously made it easier to clean than if there was carpeting. But we had upstairs neighbors, whose every footfall we could hear because there was, obviously, only tile up there. When we checked in, the desk clerk, as promised, gave my wife, the delightful Mrs. Gam, a cold beer. It did not make a good first impression. It was a \"Milwaukee's Best,\" which, if you know anything about beers, is far from being Milwaukee's best. It's the kind of cheap beer you get for yourself if you want to sit on the sofa and get sloshed, not that you give to someone who just dropped serious money to stay at your hotel. Better to pay the extra pennies to get a good brand of beer or give nothing at all. The \"happy hour\" was also kind of cheap: no beer or wine, just vodka, dark rum and, I think, gin, in unlabled decanters. Now, everybody seemed to enjoy the happy hour, I know I did, but I also had the impression we were being nickle and dimed. There are other things that might effect someone's decision to stay at Eden House. They allow children. A pool filled with screaming little kids might be someone's idea of a Key West vacation.

Not only were the girls and guys of the staff really helpful, friendly, and welcoming, (Super special thanks to Jim and Sarah who were really great and showed us nothing but warmth and hospitality the whole time) but the hotel was amazing! We stayed in a private room, so we had our own bathroom. The room was cozy, but very comfortable. The cleaning service was perfect, and our room was always well taken care of. The pool and jacuzzi were phenominal! We could have, without a doubt, lounged by all the beautiful waterfalls, nature, and foliage for the rest of our lives!

I felt like mush (in a good way) when I was done with the massaging water jets. The gazebo in the middle of the courtyard was beautiful. With a palm tree growing through the middle of it, complete with a family of woodpeckers, and a swinging chair you can melt into, the view was great from up there and you could see everything that was going on in the pool area. Happy hour was awesome! There were great drinks and everyone came out of their rooms and got together by the pool. The fish ponds and waterfalls really added on to the tropical paradise atmosphere. After 10, it's quiet time, and the fountains and wildlife is all you can hear. Every day music was playing by the pool which really got us in the tropical mood. The hammocks were sooo relaxing. We especially loved the library portion of the hotel, which is a 'quiet zone'. We lounged on the hammock for hours on end and just cuddled and whispered, sipping on our drinks.... It was really beautiful. Trees canopied over the hammock, leaving just enough shade and allowing sunshine to filter through. Just the sounds of the birds and animals could put you to sleep in no time at all. There were a lot of other hammocks and porch swings located in different parts of the hotel. Everything was great. The whole look of the hotel is so laid back and relaxed. Key West is BEAUTIFUL! We can't wait to go back, and have our little pineapple cup from 'The Cheese Burger' restaraunt on Duval st (Try the MAI TAI drink; the pineapple cup is yours to keep and the drink is GREAT) with the little amount of change we saved up inside it. We're saving for next time around! I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE! I've never had such a beautiful, relaxing time in my life. I don't even want to try anywhere else, with this being our first visit to the Keys. I checked so many hotels out and we kept coming back to Eden. I'm so glad we did. The only bad reviews that I found were ridiculous. Complaining about the noise curfew (Quiet after 10) and room space? Trust us, The noise curfew makes the place enjoyable and lovely for everyone. They aren't incredibly strict, but there is a need for some noise control, as everyone knows :) The rooms vary in size depending on what you pay for. All in all, our trip was awesome, and we can't wait to go back! The only bad part about the trip is that we (well mostly me haha I was tipsy) dropped the camera in the hot tub.... Saved the memory card though! So pictures will be posted! Thanks again Eden House for a great time in Old Key West!

After days of researching guesthouses, hotels, etc. we kept coming back to Eden House so we booked our room there. It just seemed like such a homey and comfortable place and we were more than pleased with our choice. We traveled with a couple of good friends whom were celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary and we celebrated our 28th as well. After our plane ride to Miami and then taking our time driving down the keys which was a lot of fun, we were ready to relax and enjoy our all too brief stay at Eden House. When we arrived, we were greeted by a a very friendly face at the front desk and were immediately offered a cool and refreshing beverage. We were shown around a bit and then up to our room. We had a nice upstairs apartment with a very spacious bathroom , a full kitchen, television, a queen bedroom area which our companions slept in and a queen sofa sleeper with an air mattress which we slept on very comfortably, a back screened in porch and a private balcony overlooking the pool and jacuzzi. We settled in , put on our swimsuits and barely made the end of happy hour at the pool . We immediately began to socialize and meet some new friends. After a refreshing beverage and a dip in the \"Garden of Eden\" pool as we called it, we set our sights on exploring our new home away from home for four days and a nice dinner. We went back to the front desk and chatted with the ladies to get the lay of the land and got a complimentary map of Key West to help us guide our way around. Although we had a rental car, we walked most everywhere we went. We were also able to book some activities through Eden House and it was nice to be able to get good feedback on what activities were better than others and get some good recommendations of dining, snorkeling, shopping etc from our hosts at Eden House. This made it nice because we didn't have to waste our time trying to decide on the many activities, restaurants, etc. to choose from and how to get there. The folks at the front desk were always ready to answer questions and offer friendly advice. The walk up to Duval Street was a straight shot up and we walked it easily within 10 minutes. Another nice thing about our location was that it was a lovely stroll past quaint homes, guesthouses, etc. and we were glad that we stayed well off Duval Street which is where the all action is. This made for nice quiet evening strolls back to our little slice of paradise and with the 10PM quiet time a restful sleep too! On our first morning there I got up at my usual early time, and left the other sleepy heads in bed and headed downstairs to a hot cup of coffee and a very cordial greeting from the folks that took such good care of us during our stay. We chatted briefly and I had mentioned some activities we wanted to do and was given a lot of good information to look over. I took my morning coffee out in the lovely gardens and pool area and enjoyed the tranquility of the morning and waking up to face my first day in Key West. I met a four-legged friend, GITMO, the cat and we became fast friends and he met me each morning on my stay. Being an early riser, I watched as the grounds keeper quietly and carefully was already tending to the pool area tidying up the place which he did each day. Soon the other people in our party awoke and enjoyed the same ritual. We scheduled the days trip to go snorkeling and the nice folks at Eden House set up our trip for us so all we had to do is show up! Afterwards we came back to our freshened apartment , changed clothes and struck out for Duval Street and all the shops, restaurants and bars. The walk was pleasant as we passed rows of other nice guesthouses, small homes, cats and chickens (which are everywhere) and even made friends with a local resident parrot. It only takes about 10-15 minutes to get to Duval Street. We were very glad that our guest house and room were at a distance from all the activities on Duval Street. It made for a nice transition and Eden House was just far enough off the beaten path to relish in the quiet morning and evening strolls to and fro. There were other areas nearby that we frequented. Just a few blocks over we found a harbor area with several wonderful restaurants, bars, and boating activities such as sailing, fishing, snorkel trips, etc. . All were within a 5-10 minute walk as well. . We could have rented bikes at Eden House but walking was our choice mode of travel, that way we got to see many of the lovely local homes and beautiful gardens along the way. We came back to Eden House to rest a bit by the pool each afternoon and met new friends poolside for happy hour at 4PM each day and we looked forward to our time just chilling by the pool each day. We had an excellent stay and it far exceeded our expectations. We most definitely will return to Eden House again and again I am sure. All I can say is if you want a little slice of paradise, Eden House in Key West can't be fully appreciated until you go there! Hat's off to all the people that made our stay so much more than just another trip.

This was our first time visiting Key West and we did a lot of research on where to stay and what to do. Had we known Key West was going to be this fun, we would have stayed there for the entire week we were in Florida. Once you set foot in the Eden House, you realize that you want to take a few days and just relax within the gates of the hotel itself without ever leaving! My two friends and I stayed at the Eden House for 4 days in May in room 403 and it was phenomenal. The staff is very friendly, this includes everyone from the front desk to housekeeping and maintenance. The room we stayed in was very clean, comfortable, and had a perfect view. As you go up to the room, there is a covered porch with a table and chairs. We really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it though because there was a balcony on the other side overlooking the pool and Jacuzzi, making us feel like we were in a presidential suite! Each morning we made plates of fresh fruit for ourselves and had breakfast out on the balcony! The room had a queen bed that was quite comfortable and then a pullout air mattress sofa that was equally comfortable. The entire 4 days we were there, we left the balcony doors wide open, even when we slept, because when you lay on the sofa-bed, you can see the stars and palm trees blowing in the breeze and you can hear the waterfalls. The ambiance was very peaceful. The room had a little living room area that had two chairs and a TV. We put our suitcase in front of the TV because this is paradise and we wanted to be disconnected with the real world while we were here. There is also a kitchenette with a full size (new) fridge, a sink, cabinets, stove, microwave, dishes (although we used our own paper plates and plastic cups), and paper towels. We had fresh towels everyday because Pasha, our housekeeper, was wonderful! She was so sweet and kind. The bathroom was big and I mean huge actually. There was enough room for all three of us to be in there at once doing our hair and makeup. There is plenty of counter space and electrical outlets. The entire room (including the bathroom) has ceiling fans that help move the air because hey, it gets warm, duh! There are also lots of shelves to put your clothes on if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to live out of your suitcase, along with a hangers and an iron. I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I can say anything bad about this place, except for those roosters all over the island that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when to shut up!!! Every day I would look at some random rooster (not the hens of course because they were quiet) and threaten to have them for dinner but it apparently didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t faze them. Oh well. The pool is always the perfect temperature and the Jacuzzi is HOOOTTT which makes it perfect!!!! They are both very clean, as is the entire pool area, including the chairs and decks. If you are planning on sitting out by the pool at night, bring mosquito repellant though. There is a NO NOISE AFTER 10:00 pm policy which you must adhere to. It is for the common courtesy of the other guests. For those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand this, I suggest they go back to Duval Street and sleep on the street. If you want to bring the party back to your room, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Go back to Duval Street and come back when you are ready to be quiet. Eden House is a quiet (at night) and relaxing place. For those who enjoy noisy and very lively hotels, might I suggest the La Te Da Hotel or anything else on Duval. For those who complain about this policy, why are you staying at Eden House when you know the rules? The hammocks on the property are large and very relaxing! There are plenty of them also! There is a huge list of restaurants in the lobby so check that out if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where to eat. People who complain about the distance to Duval Street are either in extremely bad shape (and I mean they have emphysema or something) or they are just plain lazyyyyyyy! The distance is a nice 10 - 15minute stroll through the Old Town with beautiful scenery and proper sidewalks to walk on. It also helps that there is a small mom and pop grocery store on the way in case you need something on your way back. Fleming St (where Eden House is located) deposits you right at the hub of Duval Street, where you can find virtually anything you want or need from food to entertainment. Sloppy Joes is to the right, along with Mallory Square and other great places, while the Southernmost Point, the Butterfly Conservatory, and a great pizza place called Upper Crust is on your left. The best thing was that the hotel is only two or three blocks away from the marina! The day we took a day trip to the Dry Tortugas, we took the 5 minute walk over to the docks and it was so easy! The Conch Train is also there so we did that on another day. We rented bikes from Eden House for $7.00 each for a 12 hour rental which was just fine for us. A 24 hour rental was $10. They all have locks which you will need. There are also baskets on the bikes which you can place a purse or map in. We took the bikes over to the Key West Cemetery which was close and we rode through the streets of Old Town which were really beautiful. It is a very pedestrian and bicycle friendly city. The Eden House is a wonderful place to meet new people as well. You always know that people are from out of town but what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting is that we met people from as far as Switzerland and as close as New York. The people are very friendly around there, so if you end up down there, be nice and say hello\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurt! We met some wonderful people and quite a few interesting characters at the Eden House. This was the perfect place for us and we will book at the Eden House every time we head back to Key West, hands down. We told our friends and co-workers about Eden House and they loved our pictures and stories so much that five of them have already decided to visit within the next year and stay at Eden House. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a Marriott or Hyatt so remember that and just relax. If you need super amenities such as a soaking tub or spa, go elsewhere. Otherwise, if you just want a clean, comfortable, beautiful, and relaxing place with reasonable prices, stay here!", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hartford, CT", "Title": "\u201cNot A Fan\u201d", "Author": "CTDusty", "ReviewID": "UR7630627", "Content": "After reading all the positive reviews, I expected to have a great time at the Eden House. We stayed for 3 nights. Because we booked so late, our first night was in a small room off of the pool area. The room was tiny. At night the outside lights kept our room light and you could hear everyone pass the room as they came in. The next two nights, we had booked a larger room. We moved rooms mid afternoon, the second day, after the larger room ,an efficiency unit, had been cleaned. We brought our stuff in and we had some food to put in the fridge. The freezer door fell off, it was one of those old fridges, that had an internal freezer door--it was in desperate need of defrosting. Why the cleaning staff didn't notice that before I do not understand. It was also very warm in the room, the airconditioning unit was older and probably not large enough for the space. We called the desk and Jim, the manager came in, he suggested we move to the room downstairs. So he showed us the room, another efficiency unit and we repacked our stuff and lugged everything downstairs. later in the evening when we came home from dinner we watched some television and then noticed that water was dripping from the ceiling--the upstairs freezer was defrosting! We called and the Jim went up there and mopped it up, by the time we woke up, it was no longer raining in our room. We asked Jim if we could check out later because we had a late flight. He said to ask Pasha, the cleaning woman. She said we could stay as late as we wanted and she would just clean the room out the next day. When we went back to the front desk, Jim was gone, and Elizabeth was there she said that we could not do that. We had to be out by 2pm. So we said fine, we're running some errands, we'll come back and be out by 2. When we returned to the hotel at 1, Mike the owner (who never introduced himself to us) was speaking with Elizabeth as we passed through the lobby. The minute we got to our room, Mike called and said we had to be out by 2. We told him we were aware of that. And we were out by 2. I saw no evidence of a friendly caring owner, whose customer's happiness came first. As far as cocktail hour? They put out generic liquor, some mixers and a bowl of pretzels for one hour.

The pool is the central area of the hotel and the place to be. At 4:00, the hotel serves complimentary drinks. Everyone comes out for this and we met many other couples at the pool.

We had a combination of rooms -- two were the least expensive 'shared bath' category ($135/night), and one Semi-deluxe at $270/night. Eden House is a beautiful place, very well kept up, and the rooms and public areas were immaculate. Beautiful paint on all the woodwork -- everything looked freshly painted in subtle tones of grey, white and light blue, gorgeous pieces of art here and there, and of course the lush plantings, mature palm trees, and waterfalls and water features make this a relaxing and friendly environment. This is a small property, [nothing extravagant here], consisting of a cluster of shuttered and wood-painted buildings that all more or less surround the central pool. It has the feel of visiting well-off friends at a quaint back-yard guest house. Our semi-deluxe room was located in the main building in room 202. This is a beautiful room, and was very spacious, when compared to other rooms in the same category/price range. Other rooms in this range, that we walked by, were about 1/3 smaller, and fronted the long shared porches that faced the pool. We had a semi-private porch that encompassed the entire second story of the front of the Eden House (what you see in photos of the exterior of the building.) This porch was shared with just one other room (201) and it runs the entire length of the building front, so it is spacious enough to feel like your own private porch. We really, really liked having this semi-private area -- coupled with the fact that nobody walks past your door, this was a private space. Spacious large porch with small table, wicker chairs, and a padded chair swing. Our room was tiled with slate/stone, had a large bathroom with shower stall and small fridge and TV. Again, the room was kept immaculate by our friendly housekeeper Leon! The only drawback would be that fronting the road, this porch could be noisy [from street noise, most often in the early mornings] (garbage trucks, street sweepers, etc). We felt that the privacy of the porch and the size of the room made up for this, but this would be personal opinion. I imagine some would prefer a smaller room that looked out on the quieter pool area -- even if people were walking by on the porch. All in all, we liked our porch, though because In the evenings, it was fun to sit on the porch and see the ongoing activities in the town (residential neighborhood, as opposed to looking down over the pool). Also, be aware that there are blinds, and not curtains, so that the room is never very dark. This is true of all of the rooms at Eden House. The bright sun in the a.m. made it tough to sleep in past daybreak. Might want to bring along something like a sleeping mask if you like it very dark or like to sleep in late. Of course, we live in the woods and are used to pitch dark at night, so if you are used to an urban environment, you might not even notice! Our friends were in the shared bath rooms which are a real bargain in Key West! That said, they are indeed very very small (one has a double bed, and one had two twins) and the bathroom was teeny tiny with an old claw foot tub. It was clear these were the original rooms to the property, designed in the days when travelers were not accustomed to the large spaces we see today! These rooms have an older feel -- much like sleepaway camp. If you like the price, don't be scared off though.... they are still quite charming and for the price, a great, great deal! Remember, there is no TV and no fridge in these rooms. [There is a large-screen tv in the lobby.] The layout of the shared bath rooms was not the best for sharing with someone you don't know... the bathroom abutted the rooms very closely!! If with friends, not too bad, however. For a family with kids, it might be just right. The water pressure was not great in this bathroom. The upside to these many caveats is this: right outside the door, literally just steps away, is a hallway shower and hallway bathroom (two separate rooms) so that you can just step outside your door and use these if you prefer more privacy and better water pressure! We liked that these rooms (shower and bathroom) were available to anybody so that if you check out at 11, and have a late flight, you can still shower and freshen up once you've had to give up your room. The grounds are beautiful, and very relaxing. We were there during a busy school holiday, and the only drawback was that we were dismayed by the ongoing practice of \"lounge chair saving\" that made it a race each day to get the best lounge chair by the pool. Some guests were placing towels and personal items on loungers and then going off for the day!! This rude practice seemed to be just one particular group of visitors, however, and by our last 4 days, there was none of this happening, and chairs at the pool were quite plentiful. There is also a nice sundeck up above, with more chairs (though no shade at all up on this deck) so if you are a sunlover, you can get a chair up on the deck, just a flight of stairs up from the pool. Also, the hammock area is nice, and just to the right of the pool. Shady spot, and big comfy cloth hammocks with pillows attached! Even though EH was at full capacity while we were there, there were so many nooks and crannies, that it never really felt too \"busy\" or \"cramped\". There was always someplace to find a shady spot, or private corner. Pool is kept VERY warm. Ranged from 88 to 92 degrees. Hot tub about 100 degrees. Pool floats, etc, were provided -- noodles and such. The BBQ area is great! Eden House provides Charcoal, Lighter Fluid, Tin foil, lighters, clean up pails, and all utensils, so that the only thing you need to provide is your food! This is in a fenced off area, away from the pool, and private, and was kept very neat and clean. There is a full service grocery store just about 10 minutes walk away (Faustos) and several smaller neighbhorhood type groceries are even closer -- though I don't think had fresh meats. We rented bikes on a regular basis from the front desk. Very convenient, and we really enjoyed getting around on these touring style bikes. You leave a $250 CC deposit, and then the reasonable rates are $7 for 12 hours, or $10 for 24 hours, this includes a lock and key. The $250 is not charged to your card, simply kept as a deposit, returned when the bike is returned. (weekly rates are even a better deal) It was nice to have them right at the front desk! At night, we were given flashlights to place in the bike baskets. Front desk staff was very helpful with restaurant suggestions, and more! Thanks Sarah for all your help! There is no breakfast of any kind at EH, but, coffee and teas and Hot chocolate are available in the lobby. There are many, many restaurants nearby, within walking or biking distance. Location is really great, with a short walk to the docks area -- Key West Bight (including Turtle Kraals, Half Shell Raw Bar, Schooner Wharf Bar) and to Pepe's on Caroline street. About 10 minutes to Duval street if that's your thing. For us, it was not. We preferred the quieter back streets and very \"small town\" feel of Key West. We loved El Siboney (suggested by the front desk) for their Cuban food. We biked over, waited a half hour out front while sipping home-made Sangria's, and had very reasonably priced meals that were great! Blue Heaven has fab Key Lime pie...and a ping pong table. It would be a bit of a walk... again, those bikes are great! We also biked to Smathers Beach, and down to the Butterfly conservatory on the southernmost point of the island. All in all, we enjoyed our trip to Key West, for it's small town yet semi-urban atmosphere and variety of laid back things to do. Eden House is well placed to take advantage of all the island has to offer. The daily free happy hour was fun for meeting other guests --- this is a low-key affair with gin or vodka in carafes with papered hand-lettered labels \"GIN\" and \"VODKA\" -- so don't expect Grey Goose! Also available was Rum, and all the mixers. And of course, that check in beverage of Milwaukee's Best, really sets the stage! This hotel has wide appeal for various types of travelers; even though it is somewhat funky and down-to-earth, it is charming enough that I believe even if you are used to 5 star properties, with more amenities, and bigger rooms, you'll still find this property quaint, and a fun place to stay in Key West!! Note: THERE ARE NO HAIRDRYERS IN THE ROOMS. We have gotten used to not packing these as so many places provide them -- so just note that EH doesn't and bring your own. (Also ---Just a comment on a previous post: We had no problems with noise, nor did we meet any Noise Nazis.

I found that at this end of town, even the Hilton has small rooms and they are double the price. My room was very clean and the tiny bathroom seemed fairly new. The front porch was a nice place to kick back in a rocker and read and relax. The pool was inviting and the staff was friendly. The night man fussed over me when I got up very early one morning and came into the lobby for coffee, trying to turn on lights and get me more coffee and in general making me feel very pampered.

I will start with the good points: Location - although a healthy walk from Duval Street, it is in a lovely quiet residential area, and the walk is great if you want to absorb the local architecture. Atmosphere - the \"communal areas\" of the house were lovely, from the nice pool, to the hammocks, to the hot tub, to the verandas of the ground floor rooms. Typically Key West and very quaint. Parking - free on-site parking, what more can I say. Now, sadly there are bad points: Room - small, cramped, in need of refurbishment. There was a very large fridge in the corner of the room (we are not talking mini bar size, we are talking ~4 foot high) which dwarfed the room, and there was some very strange furniture piled up in another corner. On entering, it felt like they had put us in the store cupboard. Large bathroom though (if basic) - but also in need of some investment. Staff - I have to admit, there was a girl who worked there who seemed lovely, but she did not deal with us. Instead, the girl on reception on our visit was simply atrocious. She was surly, disinterested, and never once smiled. The other member of staff I have cause to complain about was the maid - she was hurrying us to leave and check out of our room, even though it was one and a half hours before check out time - not good Noise - our room was right next to the hot tub, and when people are enjoying themselves in the hot tub into the early hours, you lie in bed hearing every word spoken (plus other stuff). And whilst we are talking hot tubs, here is the one thing I will remember this guest house by - the hot tub contained so much bleach that our swim suits came out white, from vivid blue and pink. This was in only a 20 minute dip. The said surly girl on reception barely grunted when we told her on checking out, and I couldn't bring myself to make a fuss. However, since the bleach had totally ruined our swim costumes, I felt compelled to complain once I retumed home. It took numerous emails before Eden even replied to me, but eventually, after some negotiation, they did compensate us financially. A very nice staff member dealt with my complaint very well in the end, and with good grace, but it didn't happen quickly. Price - I have come to price last, because of course it is a case of whether good value was obtained. Ignoring the mishap with the bleach, and ignoring the staff concerns, I believe it to be a little over-priced, but only a little (I paid US$250). In summary, a guest house I don't think I will forget, purely for it's nice asthetics (and of course the bleach thing), but the room let it down a bit too much, and the selection of staff is clearly not great in some areas.

This isn't hyperbole: Eden House is unique in that everthing seems right. It's difficult to imagine how one could improve the place. Okay, there are a few things and I'll deal with them first. The official explanation for the shelving for your clothes instead of bureaus with drawers is because of the humidity. Maybe so, but more shelves would be helpful, particularly if you're traveling further on after your Key West stay, as we were. A few extra hooks in the bathroom would assist with wet bathing suits, bath towels, etc. And the morning person staffing the desk should be assured that smiling or otherwise acknowledging her guests is not fatal. Perhaps she's not a morning person, and that's why they've put her on duty when guests won't be checking in. And that's it for the nitpicking. Everything else is exactly as it should be. Eden House is a short distance from Duval Street, the historic seaport, Mallory Square, and plenty of memorable restaurants. But with its shaded hammocks, excellent if modestly-sized pool (which is uniquely landscaped and actually better than it looks on their website), jacuzzi, and gardens that surround guests with tropical atmosphere, Eden House is itself an attraction. You'll be surprised at how enlightening lying in a hammock watching the courtship of lizards on a palm tree can be. Keep in mind, however, that Eden House is not really designed for the young and rowdy. While the proprietor's request for quiet at nighttime might be construed as an impediment to fun by spring breakers, it didn't cramp our style in the least. We had our fill of that type of diversion on and around Duval Street, and appreciated the quiet serenity of relaxing in the jacuzzi after a busy day of sightseeing and barhopping. Although the pool and jacuzzi are officially closed after 10 p.m., they'll permit later swims if you promise to be quiet. \"If we can't hear you, we can't see you\" is how the sign reads. Heck, they'll even hand you a towel! Our room was on the second floor, and it featured a porch swing outside the door and a good view overlooking Fleming Street.

The Eden House is a charming Key West guest house and is centrally located in Old Town Key West. We do not use a car while we are at the Eden House because everything is within walking distance. If you wish to use a bike to get around, the Eden House has them for rent. Guests of the Eden House should not expect a five star hotel, but you will enjoy the laid back style, mingling with the other guest at a daily happy hour, the large hot tub, the peaceful hammock area with a waterfall, and the well cared for grounds. The housekeeping is excellent and the people at the front desk can provide information on where to go and what to see while in Key West. Make sure to chat with Mike Eden, the Eden House owner for the last 30 years, because he is a great source for Key West information. While in Key West, make sure to see the Hemingway House, The Key West Lighthouse, The Butterfly Conservatory is a must for nature lovers, and check out Fort Zackary Taylor. I highly recommend a trip to Blue Heaven for an outdoor breakfast experience. Lastly, make sure to see the sunset from Mallory Square; for an experience you will not forget!

The rooms vary in size and age. There are four reasons I would not return: 1) Lots of noise at night - our friends in another suite were kept awake by some people who stayed up all night (they apparently trashed the room and may have had a criminal background). We were awakened a few times by what sounded like a wrestling match upstairs, and then at 4:30 by some people leaving their room with all their luggage. The walls and floors are paper thin. When we complained, they moved us to a \"deluxe\" room (meaning TV & minifridge), but we were still hearing party noise until midnight. 2) They would not let us alter our reservation so we could get out of there a day early. They require something like 20 days notice. Their info says they will offer a full refund if you were not satisfied, but this was just a case where we wanted to shorten our stay. They were inflexible. 3) The second room they put us in was so small there was not enough room to open a suitcase unless it was on the bed. We had to unpack and put our clothes on the dusty sticky shelves. My daughter slept on an air mattress wedged between the bed and the fridge. 4) The rooms are not very clean. The tub and shower tiles looked grimy and when I wiped the bathroom floor with a baby wipe, it was black with dirt. We had to clean the shelves before putting our clothes on them.

We stayed in the 2 bedroom suite (deluxe conch?) but beware that one of the bedrooms has no view whatsoever (unless you enjoy a restaurant rooftop and its associated equipment as well as a parking lot and its associated dumpsters). Unfortunately, the A/C units or pumps of some kind were quite noisy and prevented us from having a total quality sleep that we had hoped for. They also forced us to not use the bedroom's balcony...it was way too noisy. The other bedroom was very lovely and had a great balcony (with a nice, cushioned swing) overlooking Margaret St. The bathroom had pretty lame water pressure for the shower but we accepted that with no problem. Note that the door to this bathroom is not a standard door, rather a two piece door and we felt that it lacked privacy because it was right next to the \"living room\" with the TV, and you can hear everything. The fact that the Eden House has free wi-fi was what sealed the deal for us to book there. We were extremely disappointed though when we tried to use it for two days but it was flat out not working. On all occasions that we advised the front desk, they had no idea in how to assist in trying to resolve it. Take note that we did follow the explicit instructions that were provided on how to access their wi-fi yet it failed everytime we tried to access it - in the pool area and in the lobby area.

Cons: 1)The buildings can be noisy in the morning after 900 (with cleaning and such). 2) The street (Fleming) tends to be busy, sometimes with big delivery trucks and noisy scooters. It can make for a not so pleasant front porch spot (I used an Mp3 player very successfully to block out any unpleasant noise). 3) The wi-fi can't be picked up out back, where it is quiet, by the hammocks or pool, much to my daughter's dismay.

Spending only part of a day there we were unable to find a place we would definitely want to stay at when we returned. Instead we relied on the reviews at Tripadvisor. We are both glad we did. The Eden House lived up to the reviews and then some. If you are looking for the Ritz-Carlton this is not the place for you. Luckily we were not looking for the Ritz-Carlton. Vacationing in Key West is about the fun and sun coupled with the quaint shops and the happy-go-lucky residents. The Eden House epitomizes all of these things with its pool surrounded by palm trees and small bungalow-type rooms complete with patios and hammocks. We stayed in room 422 as it was one of the only two-bedroom units available in the hotel. This room was the upstairs portion of their newest addition to the Eden House complex. The rooms were absolutely spotless and Posha, our maid, made sure it remained that way for the entire week we stayed. If we were to stay again we would probably request room 501 (downstairs) or 502 (upstairs) as they seemed to have some of the prettiest views of the grounds. The entire staff was extremely friendly and always willing to suggest places to go and restaurants to eat at (which were never a disappointment). Location was also very convenient.

Had it been a real problem, we would have felt comfortable informing the staff, who I'm sure would have taken care of the issue most diplomatically. The distance from Duval and Mallory Square allows for a nice stroll in the evening. If you're looking for a great dinner right around the block, visit Michael's and sit in the courtyard, if it's not too hot. The only odd thing about Eden House is the music by the pool - the same song is played twice in a row, every song! I don't know if this is intentional or not, but it's definitely unusual.

No other issues. The tropical gardens at The Eden House are amazing. Flowers, bushes, trees really make the place a tranquil haven. Pool and surrounding area kept very nice. We didn't partake in daily complimentary happy hour. The Eden House was quite full during our stay, due to the holiday weekend. Previous reviews mention the hushing of loud guests. Not this time. There were private parties going on at the pool late hours each night. Perfect weather, upper 80s-low 90s with not a rain drop. Rented bikes from The Eden House, rode down to Southernmost Point. Spent a few hours poolside at Atlantic Shores. Went on a half-day fishing boat, Tortuga. Wished we could have done that again. Great meals at El Meson de Pepe (Cuban), Jamaica Me Hungry (Jamaican), fish & chips at Crabby Dick's, and the best meal, by far, at Conch Republic. Daily happy hour and raw oysters at Half Shell Raw Bar. Also visits to Schooner's Wharf, Monty's, and Turtle Kraals. Watching the Minimal Regatta at Schooner's Wharf on Sunday was lots of fun. Caught sunset celebrations at Mallory Square, walked Duval St. every night. Stops at Sloppy Joe's, Fat Tuesday's. T-shirt from Hog's Breath. Long walk back, but definitely do-able. Had a great time, but 4 days was enough. Would I go back?

I stayed in the loft apartment overlooking the pool and had a fantastic stay. From the very helpful cheerful young lady at check in with the complimentary cold bottle of beer, who kept me supplied with umbrellas, band aids, sewing kit and of course the obligatory Advil (after a heavy night at the Schooner Wharf Bar!) to the guys who kept the pool side clean, tidy and washed down and the lovely housekeeper who managed to keep me tidy (not an easy feat), the staff were incredible. The Loft apartment was a dream, certainly totally spacious enough for me (as a single). The only downside was that I was alone as it was lovely and romantic climbing the spiral staircase to bed and with a lovely balcony lit up overlooking the pool. The room was very clean and the bathroom and kitchenette kept stocked with essentials. The pool was heated and the laying next to it with the waterfall tumbling into it and climbing into a beautifully warm jacuzzi in the rain with a complimentary drink at Happy Hour made my vacation one of the best I have had in years. I would not hesitate to stay at the Eden House again (always assuming they have rooms of course as it is very popular - but I can see why). Far enough from the action to get a good nights sleep but close enough to walk to Duval ( a few blocks) or the Schooner Wharf Bar (my new favourite place). The staff will easily recommend so many places to visit/do/see but check the Eden House website which is kept updated with all sorts of information. If you like individual attention, a wide range of different, quirky, interesting, romantic rooms, a staff that treat you by name and not number, and all the little things that make a good guesthouse great (such as complimentary happy hour) then try and grab a room (any room!) here, if not head to the big hotels in new town and get treated like just another dollar bill.

Because the pool is small once you get ten people in it - especially when they are pushing each other around playfully there really isn't much more room for anyone else. While I probably should have complained about it I felt that the staff should have monitored it much more closely especially when they brought the \"happy-hour\" tray out - they saw what was going on for themselves. The staff was very nice but really didn't seemed too concerned about the noise level or everyone's comfort. Since we were on the bottom floor, we heard every noise coming from above.

We were completely undecided where to get away, as we had been to all the \"exotic\" places one might have on their \"wish list.\" Maui, for me, prior to experiencing the Keys, had been my destination of choice as we had vacationed there several times in the past. We decided we didn't want to spend so much of our time on a plane (coming from Nashville), and we found trip advisor, by far, the most helpful resource in selecting our destination. After reading countless trip advisor reviews, and using Priceline - we found roundtrip tickets from Nashville to Ft. Lauderdale and a rental car for a week for just a little over $300.00 for the two of us! Can't beat that price especially with gas prices well over $2.00/gallon. With our travel booked, we decided once in Ft. Lauderdale, we'd leisurely drive to the southernmost part of the US - Key West, FL. I was a little reluctant as I had only been there one time (at the age of 6) and my only memory was the 7 mile bridge, and at that age, it seemed a lifetime before I saw land! Finding a place to stay became a challenge for me after reading good to very ugly reviews of hotels, resorts, B&B's and guesthouses in the Keys, but I kept running across all these wonderful reviews of The Eden House. I went on their website, and clicked on their webcam several times before booking our reservations. We have always found comfort having been the \"resort\" type traveler staying at heavily advertised, well-known hotels...so selecting a guesthouse and having only the opinion of other people we didn't know was pretty scary...you just never know what you're getting in to. I kept second guessing these reviews thinking someone put these people up to it to gain advertisement for locations - I guess that's the cynical side of me. But...long story short - The Eden House and our trip to the Keys was by far the best vacation we have ever experienced. The accomodations and lush surroundings at The Eden House are impeccable; the staff are down to earth \"real\" people - not your typical starched, uniformed mechanical employees you find at a resort/hotel. This staff truly cares - which you don't find too often these days. They go above and beyond customer service to ensure your vacation is the best. There are many things to do in the Keys - and a car is just not necessary once you get there - so my advise to you would be to drop your rental off if you drive from Miami or another part of FL...get ready for bike rides, rent a moped, walk, take some boat trips, deep sea fish... (there are plenty of charters to choose from). The only negative thing that I will say (and this comes from a \"southern\" raised individual who deals with the public on a daily basis and understands that customer service is paramount to the success of any business) is that a handful of the wait staff at area restaurants and local shops were some of the rudest individuals I have ever run across...I kept thinking, come on people - you're in a beautiful part of the world, you have sun shining on your face every day and you have customers putting money in your pocket! If you're havin' a bad day - don't take it out on the hand that feeds you... All and all...visit Key West and stay at The Eden House. As I told the staff at Eden when we were checking out...we will be back...and they simply replied with a genuine smile, \"we know you will!\"", "Date": "May 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooksville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cLacking customer service\u201d", "Author": "redam", "ReviewID": "UR3459588", "Content": "7 or of my closest friends and I booked a weekend package (fun in the sun) four months early for May 6 - 9th with Maggie (who was most helpful) - we were assured that they would be able to accomodate the group with rooms, bikes & snorkel trips as advertised in website. I called one week prior to trip as she suggested to advise of snorkel trip dates - since we were on a limited time schedule we could only book one of the snorkel trips even though we were elegible and paid for two (not a problem for us). Maggie called me back and left a detailed msg that 8 bikes would be ready for us when we arrived on Friday and 8 people were booked for the snorkel trip. When we arrived at check in time at 3pm - only 5 bikes were avail. The very rude girl at the desk (not Maggie) did not seem one bit interested that we have reserved, paid for and confirmed they would be ready when we arrived. She said to check back in a few hours. So we had a drink by the pool and cleaned up for our bike ride to dinner/Mallory square. However at 6:00 - still only 5 bikes. She was trying to tell us how they would be back later that night and that she ahd 5 ready. This did us no good-were we to leave 3 members of our group to walk? I thought we were very understanding about the situation. So we did just that - all walked to dinner & sunset. We even talked to the gentlman at the desk to no eval before we left. He sd we would be compensated to 3 bikes - 1/2 day rental. When we asked if he could help us locate 3 bikes to rent for the evening, he called one place and sd they were all rented too. Not much effort there. Finally after sunset & dinner (10:30 pm) they had the addidtional bikes. Well to say the least we weren't going far on them by then. When we checked out - we all received $1.50 each ($3) checks with just a note \"sorry for your hardship\" - no explaination - This incedent did not ruin our trip - the rooms were clean, place was nice, but the customer services was horrible. No one put the newspaper down long enough to help us as the visitor about the bikes, and in the end became defensive and rude. May I add that we all live in Florida and travel to KW a couple of times a year. It just would have been nice if Maggie or someone with management applogized in person to us while we were there - I thought our money was just as green as other tourist.

Most previous visits were enjoyed at the family condo in Truman Annex. Last year, 'Dear Old Dad' sold the condo, so we freeloaders needed to find new digs. The Eden House met our expectations of a clean, comfortable, welcoming, funky, friendly, conveniently located, owner operated and reasonably priced home away from home in every way. The deluxe room my wife and I reserved was smaller than we expected. When we returned to the desk to discuss this issue, we were politely offered several larger rooms to consider at no additional cost. With more than a few keys in hand we began a self guided tour. This unplanned adventure was fun, and we choose to stay with the recently renovated poolside unit we originally reserved. Happy hour......Gin, Vodka, Rum a few bottles of soda, OJ, plastic cups and ice....Poolside at 4:00 PM and compliments of the house. It worked for us and everyone we met. Each evening we enjoyed ordinary drinks in the company of interesting people. All in all a great way to prepare for Sunset!

Eden House is a good balance of all the varied options you have at which to stay in Key West. In our opinion, it's part B&B (without the breakfast) and part hotel, but not just your average hotel. More like a comfortable laid back hotel with lots of Key West character - from the lush gardens to the relaxing hammocks and swings to the nice wooden elevated sundeck and great pool (with waterfall) and jacuzzi (spent hours in the big jacuzzi). We stayed in a \"deluxe room\" which was pretty average, but very sufficient. Our friends stayed in a \"small deluxe room\" which was very small and a bit cramped, but again, very sufficient. Would recommend getting at least the normal deluxe room or a large deluxe. The warm cheap liquor and warm mixers at the daily happy hour were nothing to write home about, but did the trick to get the evening rolling.

We were really looking forward to having champagne in our room when we arrived. Unfortunately, there was neither champagne nor flutes in our room.

They did make the reservations for us and the cruise was wonderful. When we checked out I asked them again about the Champagne and ethched flutes and I was told they were still \"working on it.\" I then asked about the lithograph, and they didn't seem to know that it should have been included in our package. Upon checking, the staff member realized that it should have been included and retrieved a lithograph form the gift shop. All in all, the Eden House is a nice place with pleasant staff, but I suspect that not too many people select their Romance Package because nobody seemed to know about it.

We had a first floor apartment which offered a separate living and sleeping area, perfect for when our baby was napping and we wanted to watch TV or chat. The porches are large and private, the room was very clean with friendly staff. The pool was clean and the happy hour by the pool and in the hot tub was fun and a great way to meet people!

Maybe I should not join all the good folks who recommend staying at the Eden House. I just might find myself closed out when I call for reservations. But, then, how many Key West reviews mention the owner's name in the review? Or the wonderful employees by name? How many reviews are replied to by the owner himself? Very few, indeed! Although Mike Eden was on vacation when we stayed at the Eden House last year, and we have never met him, the rest of the staff made us feel like we were \"home\". From Bob's first email responding to my questions, to being met at the front door by Maggie, and Carlos to clean up after two very messy people, this is the only place we will ever stay in Key West. We stayed in the \"budget\" rooms, and although not as modern as the rest of the rooms, it was kept spotless as well as the shared bathroom. (Thank you, Carlos) Only complaint about our room, were the stairs to get to our room. Very bad on my old knees. Our fault. Not the staffs. Next time.....lower room only! And, because we were celebrating our anniversary, our room came with two Eden House glasses and a bottle of champagne. A lovely touch, indeed! And one that two senior citizens will not soon forget. There are many lovely places to stay in Key West. Many very highly recommended. But, for us, the only place to stay.....Eden House! Thanks again, Staff, for making our stay so wonderul.

Perfect location, beautiful grounds, nice & clean rooms (stayed in 501), and very helpful staff (hats off to Carlos for finding us parking & all the tips.) Although Oregon is a long way from Key West, we hope to make it back & will return to Eden House. Tips: 1. If you like extra space & they're available, spring for the larger rooms. We peeked into a smaller room & found it to be very nice, but a tad small. Regardless, I would still stay here. 2. Upon arrival...park your car, unload it, & don't look back. Rent bikes from the front desk and enjoy exploring Key West. You can cover a lot of ground with litte effort or time and there are plenty of bike stalls for locking up & taking off on foot. 3. If you can't find free parking on-site (1st come, 1st served) or on a nearby sidestreet, don't worry. A parking structure sits within two blocks and it's only $10 for 24 hrs. Park it, leave it, and enjoy your stay. 4. Read through the Eden House/Key West notebook in your room. Provides nice background info & great dining tips. Breakfast at Pepe's is an affordable must. 5. If you stay in upper level room, please show consideration for your downstairs neighbors. Rearranging the furniture at 11:30 P.M. is NEVER a good idea!

Most people who have had complaints about their rooms don't seem to have looked at the website. Each of the room types is described and there are pictures on the site that show what a specific type of room looks like, but how much time are you spending in your room? I would suggest that anyone who is a first-timer and is concerned about the room size, to spring for a large deluxe and you will have no worries! All that being said, this place is not about the room size; it is a beautiful, tropical getaway, that makes you happy to just be there.

Mike and his crew are all great for help and assistance, but they are also great storytellers and characters in themselves!!

We would like to commend Mike and his staff for taking such good care of us during our first visit during Fantasy Fest! We have traveled to Key West several times in the past, and love all of what is offered! A wonderful opportunity to vacation and do as much or little as we want! This review of ours will try to focus on the Eden house. #1 Location - Eden house is not right on Duval, this means you can relax without a cruise ship at your front door, or noisy revelers staying up till 4 am. We found Eden house nestled in a quiet section of \"old town\" easily spotted on the corner of Fleming and Grinnell. This put us very close to the harbor and a fair walk to Mallory Square. #2 Cost - We visited during Fantasy Fest, which means everyone is booked fast and rates are at a premium. Eden house was less expensive than several B & B's that we contacted and had many more amenities. We agree that our rate was fair and well worth the stay. #3 - Comfort - We were greeted with a smile and a cool beverage. We decided to stay in room 204 which was completely updated. This room was listed as a deluxe suite with a queen size bed. Our room had a microwave, TV and refrigerator. There was space under the bed to store our luggage, and hanging racks for our clothing. We found the bed comfy, and the shower large enough for two. There were plenty of available Hammocks for quiet time, and several swings. We found the Hot tub spacious enough for 8 guests, and plenty of room to swim in the pool. The upstairs front verandah was a perfect perch to watch the Parade walk by on Friday. Kathy and I loved to sit on the front porch just before we took off on another adventure, or right when we got back from a long day! This allowed us to make new friends, and learn of more exciting places to visit and things to do. At 4 PM everyday, Mike hosted happy hour. This was a time for some guests to reminisce of the day's events, while others were just getting started! We felt that this was a perfect way to have a time for guests to mix and mingle, making new friends along the way. The free refreshments were a nice touch, compliments of the hotel.#4 Staff - Mike has hand selected a great group of folks to run Eden house! All were sensitive to any needs and would go out of their way to help us. Many good suggestions were found simply by asking. We loved talking with the staff right before or after our journeys. Having someone right there at the front desk 24 - 7, let us rest in comfort. Kudos to Bob, Kirk, Maggie, Morgan, Bill, Dexter, Mike D, John, Gary, Olga, Pasha.#5 Cleanliness - Our room was spotless upon arrival, and was cleaned to perfection every day of our stay! (Thanks Leon!) One final thought about Priscilla the cat, only people that were confident in their abilities to take good care of their guests would share their best friend with them!", "Date": "November 9, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cIt's Key West; not CLub Med\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1424061", "Content": "Eden House gives you the perfect taste of Key West. Key West is an old town... it has none of the glitz of South Beach. Key West is funky. Bright colors adorn some of the houses juxtaposed next to grand Southern Mansions. Key West is laid back. My first trip there, I packed 8 pair of shoes and wore one... my birkenstocks. Eden House is all of this. You're greeted at the door with a warm smile and an ice cold beverage of your choice. Depending on how cheap you want to be, your room could be a newly rennovated one or one of the older ones. (They're slowly rennovating all of them.) I've stayed in both. The new ones are beautiful... pickled wood, tile floors, luxurious showers, funky stained glass, and comfy beds. The unrenovated are, of course, older. But the shower and tub are clean and the bed is comfy as well. In both cases, there's not a lot of room, but hey-- are you in Key West to stay in the room?? It's a place to lay your head and sleep off the hangover! Speaking of laying your head, there are about 6 sweet hammocks scattered throughout the property. THAT'S my idea of island living... communing with nature in a swinging hammock. The review panning the pool area is a first for me. Every time I have been, the pool has been crisp and clean. Something must not have been working when that traveler was there, but be assured, Mike and his staff handled it as soon as they knew about it. And yeah, the pool is small, but if you want olympic size, go to the ocean! The happy hour is a perk I enjoy. Going down to the pool area around 4:00 is a treat. People gather 'round the bar like flies... you find out where they're from... what they've seen, and you may even make a friend. It's like a big backyard party every night. Who cars if the liquor isn't top shelf? It's free. Walking through the lobby, grounds, and pool area of the Eden House, I feel like a native Conch. The rough edges show, but that's okay... I'm relaxed, on vacation and enjoying myself. If I had wanted space, glitter, and newness, I'd have gone to Atlantis in The Bahamas. But I don't go there and my choice for every trip to Key West is Eden House... hands down! Chill out, y'all... and let the sound of the palm fronds swaying in the breeze overhead wash over you.", "Date": "October 28, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Eden House", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34345-d224519-Reviews-Eden_House-Key_West_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "Price": "$168 - $399*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1015 Fleming Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\">Key West, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33040</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "224519", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/fc/86/59/eden-house.jpg"}}
