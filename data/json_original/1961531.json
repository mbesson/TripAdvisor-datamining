Be aware when you check in that you do not get a room facing sheik zayed road as the noise at night is unbearable and you will never sleep, on thursday night the guy in a porsche at 1130pm will wake you up every thursday, at 4am you will get the ferraris racing each other and Friday pm the harleys, its awful, ear plugs, sleeping tablets will not help, i managed 4 hours sleep most nights from 2am to 6am and thats it, so bad i feared for my health, mention it to the staff and they tell you all the rooms are booked up yet its clear that this hotel runs at 60% occupancy most of the time. Staff on the door and at reception are okay and the teams on the floors are great guys , management when informed of problems are awful, check into long stay is a lottery and you will be waiting for 45mins to check in, then the card machine will not work, they take a \"deposit\" of 2k AED and never tell you why they need it...fair enough i suppose, but really just shows you the type of hotel they are. The rooms are fairly well sized and they look okay, but when you stay long you notice all types of problems, cheap furniture, bits falling off, air con either -15 or +45 and a kitchen that has no cooker except a hob which is dangerous. Be careful when there are holidays as its is very very busy expect long queues of families who cant carry a bag and expect to be valet parked which means that when you want to park your car you will wait sometimes 15mins behind big 4 by 4s who have been told there is valet parking, it gets very very noisy, and gets large groups of guys who want to party fair enough i suppose but at 4am full blasyt music, management respind by turning off their electricity, they are scared to make a fuss !, lifts take a week to get it and are not suitable for a hotel this size, be patient when waiting and dont queue just get in as soon as the door opens otherwise your politeness will not be appreciated, parking is dangerous and its best to park on the bottom floor, if you go upstairs there is a long walk to the main reception difficult when you have shopping. The charges vary between 80k per year to 125k per year for a one or 2 bed, negotiate very hard and dont pay the list although it takes an age to sort this out, bfast is a rip off and awful but the buffet dinner is good, they also do shisha if you want . Its handy for the metro and taxis into dubai mall etc, say 20 mins to the hotspots, the pool is only in the sunlight for 2 hours from early am till 11 and then shade but its full all the time, the gym is good standard but the showers are dirty and smell, they are always being cleaned. The hotel has a history of issues with water, air con, electricity and charges changing at one weeks notice, they are always slipped under your door and when you want to discuss it the GM is never there and he doesnt care either, i had several agreements to move my room none of which were enforced, the staff at long stay blatantly lie and smile at the same time, but i think they cant make any decision , customer service is not their priority, just taking your card and money. For the price its probably okay if you get it cheap ie 85 for 12 months as it does include TV and internet, the internet is so slow you cant even open email, its a joke and it will never improve, as it needs investment and this hotel is a cash cow aimed at the EE market and people who think its cheap, nothing is cheap un Dubai and certainly never hotels. overall one night or a week is okay, long stay would be okay at 65k per year at the back of the hotel , otherwise its one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in ( i count myself as a very experienced hotel user with at least 150 nights per year travelling, sadly )", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cTry it!\u201d", "Author": "vahid1357", "ReviewID": "UR123384630", "Content": "it was very clean, glorious, comfortable,... rooms are actually a suite ( sitting room,bed room, kitchen,...) if you take a room in higher floors you can enjoy the nice view from the balcony.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zurich, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cSeriously?\u201d", "Author": "Dubai A", "ReviewID": "UR122634977", "Content": "The place has some great guys, but a couple of great guys do not make for a great hotel!

There was free internet access and flat screen televisions in lounge and bedrooms. The views from the rooms are panoramic, either looking toward Downtown Dubai with its iconic Burj Kalifa (the tallest building in the world), or towards the sea withe the famous Palm Island Complex and the Atlantis Hotel. The hotel boasted excellent conference facilities with centres on the fourth and 41st floor. However some of the training rooms lacked natural light and were quite basic in their design.

The hotel offers a superb gym, several swimming pools and a children's club as well as a couple of good restaurants and a bar in the lobby.

I travel a lot with work and having lived here for more than 3 months my overriding impression of the Gloria is that it continually falls short of the expectations of a 4 star hotel. Since I arrived I have encountered a multitude of problems, including: - been told on arrival that the apartment room my company had booked was not available and I would be placed in a room with no cooking facilities or washing machine for \"we don't know how long\". The junior on the long stay check in desk could not explain to me why the hotels room booking system is clearly failing, but thankfully after a complaint letter to the sales manager an apartment was produced for me the following day. - I was then charged a 2,000 Dirham deposit. Most hotels simply hold this as space on your credit card but the Gloria hotel has actually taken 2,000 AED of my money. Because room service meals are so poor I would estimate I have used only 200 AED of this amount in the last 3 months - the Gloria are certainly getting the benefit of my cash on deposit. - the set of lights in the bedroom operated by remote control failed when i checked in at 4 am and I had to wait an hour for someone to come up, get a spare part and fix it so I could switch it off and go to sleep. I have also had problems with blinds breaking, curtains come off rails and fuses blowing. These issues have been fixed relatively quickly but it does feel like just one issue after another and as if the fixtures and fittings have been done on the cheap. Drawers in the furniture are ill fitting and hard to use. - my booked airport pick up (at 4am) did not turn up. - the lifts are, as everyone has noted, inadequate for such a large hotel - there is a usual 5-10 minute wait and sometimes longer. - the pool gets sun until only about 10am so is useless for sunbathing. - the washing machine will only operate on one programme - I've asked for this to be fixed and nothing has happened. The machine often gives out an unpleasant smell, as noted by another reviewer. There is also a very unpleasant smell underneath the kitchen sink. - the mattress is extremely worn down and offers no back support. I asked for this to be changed, since I have a damaged disc in my lumbar spine, but it was replaced with one of equally poor quality. - the wardrobe has a built in light which is supposed to go on when the doors are opened, but because the doors do not fit properly it is extremely difficult to get the light to switch off - and I've then had it randomly come on at 4 am and wake me up. After using a gym shoe to try and keep it closed, then cellotape, I have now simply removed the light bulb. - the decor is not at all to my taste and I have put away in cupboards many of the gold 'decorations'. There is a large arm chair in the bedroom which takes up too much space but when I asked for it to be taken out the sole staff member who came up was unable to get it through the door. - the cleaning is often hit and miss - the rugs are not regularly vacuumed and when furniture is moved eg the chair in the bedroom, there is a lot of dust behind. - the internet access is wired only - unbelievable in this day and age - and is extremely unreliable dropping in and out for no clear reason and running extremely slowly when it is working. I wanted to keep in touch with family and friends via skype but the internet is not good enough - don't even bother trying. Uploading photos to share via the internet will take an entire evening. The wireless internet available in the hotel lobby is equally unreliable. - the hot water is often unavailable for 'routine maintenance'. This is notified by letter under the door at extremely short notice. - the gas oven has no temperature indicator - simply a low or high setting. I have now received a notice that the gas cooking facilities will be removed unless I sign a disclaimer. I have requested a copy of the disclaimer be sent to my room to run past my company (who are footing the bill) and it has yet to be provided (some 2 weeks later). I have raised many concerns since I arrived and generally they have been resolved pretty quickly. I am disappointed that some still haven't been (eg washing machine, internet). I was also assured that the long stay manager takes my concerns seriously and would like to meet with me but this meeting has never materialised. The location is convenient for metro and cabs to the marina, palm or madinat jumeirah. The door staff, getting cabs and helping with shopping etc have always been helpful and friendly as have the numerous service engineers that have visited the room. Staff behind the desks much less so. Overall I think this could be a good hotel but too many things are not up to standard.

We stayed on the 30th floor but this was generally fine as the lifts were fast with the exception of breakfast time when we usually had to wait over 5 minutes for the lift. The rooms were nicely furnished. In each of the apartments we booked, there was one room with 2 single beds and one room with a double bed and en suite bathroom. Worth noting is the fact that the apartments were different sizes, with one being significantly bigger than the other so you may want to have a look before being allocated a room. There was also a separate kitchinette but unlike most other hotels of its type in Dubai there is no cooker so it was a bit annoying not being able to fry an egg if i was late for the free buffet breakfast. we ordered food from room service from the hotel's main restaurant on one occasion and it was higly disappointing to say the least. i was told the food would take 30minite but it took over an hour. The Grilled lobster i ordered was not fresh and therefore inedible. when i called to make a complaint the waiter on the other end actually started arguing with me on the freshness of the lobster until i firmly insisted on a replacement meal. A waiter was sent down to inspect the meal before the finally decided to give me another meal. I asked for lamb with vegetables and mashed potatoes instead of polenta. the lamb came an hour later and there were no vegetables to be found. if staying at this hotel, enjoy the nice buffet breakfast and do try the Noodle House restaurant which has nice asian food but do not bother ordering into the room or odering on the a la carte menu in the restaurant on the 8th floor because the food is just horrible. the hotel entrace is almost directly opposite the Dubai Internet city Metro station, making easy acess to city centre, Dubai mall , the world trade centre and numerous other tourist destinations.

I'd suggest it for anyone on business (free high speed internet, breakfast served from 6, close to Dubai business centres and metro) but not for people after a nice pool.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indian Rocks Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201camazing hotel apt.. very comfortable.. will come back for sure\u201d", "Author": "Karam s", "ReviewID": "UR116796181", "Content": "I took my chances and booked this hotel apt. It's a new property so not much reviews were available. Its located on the road facing the main Sheikh Zayed Road based in Media City. 40 mins drive from airport. The rooms were \"A\" Class and very comfortable. I almost felt almost at home.. The living room was big enough for 6 people to sit comfortably. I had a city view room so dint step out on balcony much. Room had all basic amenities and was well furnished. Bedroom is extremely comfortable. Kitchen is well furnished too and has most of the stuff required to cook..though I dint but I'm sure it has plenty enough. Plus there is dining table for four. There is a separate room for washing machine and ironing was there too. Bathroom is modern and well made.I was able to work comfortably as there was a work desk plus had free internet. The hotel is surrounded by a very nice Thai restaurant which has awesome food and reasonable priced.subway is also nearby. Further grocery market is walking distance. You can order from 100s of restaurants which are near by and delv in half an hour. Its 15 mins drive by taxi to emirates mall and is at a calm location much cleaner than other place I will suggest this hotel for people who want luxury at reasonable price.

In his duplicity, he first explained that the website was incorrect and that our room was a 2 bedroom \"suite\" so it didn't include a cooker/washing machine inspite of the mention of fully furnished kitchen. After further pushing from my husband, he finally admitted that the website was a marketing strategy to get people to the hotel!

I was expecting a hotel room and got an apartment complete with kitchen (toaster oven, full-size fridge and sink), dining room, living room (with TV), bedroom (king-size bed and TV) and even a balcony! FYI - An extra cot is 100AED. From the 32nd floor, we had an amazing city view - the balcony made it that much better! (Don't forget to buy your booze at the airport!!!) FYI - There also is NO BAR in this hotel! AMENITIES: 22m pool - loved it! You can sunbathe there in the morning, but in the afternoon, you have to go to the other side of the building. The gym was great too... tons of brand new cardio machines. New weights and great selection (mostly machines though, and light dumbells, there IS a leg-press though)! :) LOCATION: AWESOME!
