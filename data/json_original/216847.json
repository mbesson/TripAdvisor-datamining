While I certainly, like a good deal, which we received on this hotel, I do not believe we would stay at this Days Inn again. Check in was fast, however, because we had prepaid the room, I wanted to ensure that we were not going to be charged again in the morning, and the desk clerk told me that she 'didn't think so', and pointed to a rate code on the registration form. However, the bill still showed money due, instead of -0-. The following morning, I was able to confirm that the transaction was completed correctly. The breakfast area was too small to even entertain going to, so we went and found breakfast elsewhere. The beds were hard, t.v. while not being upgraded (flat screen) was satisfactory. Bedding, less then adequate. This hotel is close to the Husky Stadium, Northgate Mall, and downtown...which is most helpful. Just think I would pay the extra $20 or $30 to get into a hotel I felt more secure in; did not have the traffic noise, and that my son did not call 'ghetto'.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAdequate\u201d", "Author": "vegasgirlie27", "ReviewID": "UR117990514", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for one night after touring Seattle.
