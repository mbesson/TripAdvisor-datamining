I had previously stayed for 4 nights in the Puerto del Sol area and wanted something in a less chaotic area for one night between my Barcelona flight and my flight back to the US. The hotel was fine for one night but there is no way I would stay there for any longer than that. I was in a single room with no view (and thus, no light); the bedding included a very faded blue blanket and an equally faded upholstered headboard. The room was very, very dark as were the institutional-like hallways. My room felt very worn and unwelcoming. Overall, this hotel was very uncomfortable for me and I was glad I was only there for one night. At less than $80 a night, you get what you pay for, I suppose. The upside includes excellent access to the Metro as well as the train station where you can catch the airport shuttle.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South-East England", "Title": "\u201cThoroughly enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "Dublingirl52", "ReviewID": "UR124861191", "Content": "As others have said, the great advantage of this fairly small hotel is its position. One can see it from the airport express bus as it pulls into Atocha Station. You then just cross the road at the traffic-lights. I received a warm and friendly welcome at reception and was able to check in slightly early. The room was clean and warm - nights at this time of year (February) in Madrid are very cold. Our only criticism was the noise of the lift (not too bad but still annoying) every night and early morning. It was very near our room. Maybe it would be a good idea to ask for a room that is not too near the lift. The road in front of the hotel is very busy indeed. So, it is worth asking for a quiet room not overlooking the street. The breakfast was fantastic, especially the fresh orange juice. The choice of teas was excellent. There is no hot food, although we were more than happy with the cold meats and hard-boiled eggs. Again, there was a wide range of breads available, which one could toast. It was disappointing that the free wifi is only for 30 mins a day in the lobby. However, it was good that there is a free safe available at reception. Returning to the location of this hotel...it was an easy walk to many attractions/restaurants. Or, if you prefer, there is a metro stop almost outside the hotel. We enjoyed a visit (free on Sundays) to the small museum next-door to the hotel. All-in-all, I would recommend this hotel and hope to stay there again on my next visit to Madrid.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gainesville, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAdequate for our needs\u201d", "Author": "1969Gator", "ReviewID": "UR122153075", "Content": "We were overnighting between train and air connections.

The problem was no air conditioning. It was very hot in the rooms, and the AC was broken and/or not cut on yet, which apparently is common in European countries.

We arrived on the AVE from Sevilla at the Atocha station, took the escalator to the upper level, and the elevator to the street and were about 50 feet from the hotel entrance. We dropped our bags at the hotel and had the day for touring rather than schlepping luggage. Since the hotel is minutes from the Prado, Royal Botanical Garden, and Retiro Park, there is plenty to do nearby. The next morning the same elevator took us to Atocha station where we caught the Cercania then the Metro to Barajas. Couldn't have been easier. For an extended stay in Madrid, I would make a different choice, but if you want access to Atocha there is no better option.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cGood value for central Madrid\u201d", "Author": "BristolAna", "ReviewID": "UR47545736", "Content": "Location excellent for Atocha Station, Metro, Retiro Park.

I have never stayed at NH before so I do not know the standards and I am aware rooms are smaller in Europe. However these rooms were tiny. Beds were moving... we blocked the wheels but they still moved. Other than that, everything was good. Breakfast was very good, we had a child with us and they even have attractive, tasty little treats for children. Overall is good and clean hotel and not far from the main atractions. Is very close to Retiro park and the metro station is just outside the hotel. Very convenient location. Parking is a problem because nearby public parkings are very, very expensive. At the train station is 27.5 euros/day and at a closeby hotel is 24 euros. I have never paid this for a parking in north america. Look around for a no fee spot at night on the streets adjacent to the train station. During the day is hard to find. We parked at the train station for 12 hours and then found a spot late in the night and we didn;t move it from there for the rest of our stay. Also, forget going aroung by car... it is a mess.

The room was quite small and nothing particular in terms of style or atmosphere. Perhaps the worst was the wood floor, that was badly worn around the bed. Traffic noise is a problem but to be fair I have to recognise that the hotel management have done their best (there is a double window) but if you have sleep problems just ask for a room not facing the street. The good news is that air conditioning was faultless, so there was no problem in getting the adequate room temperature. If the room was not something to remember, breakfast did lighten the day: they had perhaps the best orange juice I have had in a hotel for a long time, and the rest of the food was also of a high standard.

Super close to the \"golden triangle\" and with the new bar/restaurant at the Reina Sofia, a great place to eat/drink just a couple of blocks away. Although the room was tiny, it was spotless, well decorated & the bathroom was spacious, and the staff was unbelievably helpful. Staying with a respectable chain was great for the services -- i got sick my 2nd day in Madrid, and they had a doctor come do a \"house call.\" Was feeling better in less than 24 hours (and as it was my first stop in Spain, was grateful for not having to figure out where the hospital was, etc.) I would highly recommend it for a short stay especially if you plan on traveling by train.
