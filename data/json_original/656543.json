{"Reviews": [{"Content": "so-so The room was about $33 a night. For the price- it was OK. The room was fairly large, but the bathroom was scary. There was a significant amount of mold, and you need to hold the shower head over your body while you stand in the tub (with flip flops). The AC worked well, and the staff was pretty friendly. The location is pretty good- it's about a 15 min walk to the beach, and you are a couple feet away from great restaurants.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR537529020", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "viva9583"}, {"Content": "It was just OKAY This Hotel is located about 15 to 20 mins walk from the main tourist centre where the main shopping and dining area is. However the walk is rather enjoyable as there are many shops along the way. The rooms were simple, clean and spacious. However, I must say I was lucky to stay in the newer block. I don't know how the older ones look like inside but on the outside they looked very old and with probably no renovation done since it was built. No complimentary water was given in each room. Bathroom towels were grey and old but I am not sure if that were their actual colour. Breakfast was pathethic, serving a choice of either 2 toasts with butter and jam or indonesian breakfast soto ayam. It came accompanied with juice, coffee, tea and fruits. The swimming pool was nothing to shout about. They had 2 pools but both small. The deck chairs looked like they were going to give way. Reception was fine and friendly. In conclusion, stay here only if u have to. For the price I paid, I think I was overcharged.", "Date": "Sep 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR606868693", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "etll"}, {"Content": "\u9289\ue0fe\u5056\u9289\uff43\u5142\u95ab\u6c25\u501e\u9287\ue1ba\u4efc\u942a\u71b4\u5031...   showReview(19924372, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR429047520", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9288\ue218\u506a\u9287\ue1be\u657d\u9287\ue1be\u6e61\u9288\u64b2\u8151\u9287\ue0a0\u4e97...   showReview(19920089, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 3, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR217727890", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d656543-r21435919-Restu_Bali_Hotel-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "656543", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
