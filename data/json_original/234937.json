Everything was OK, but I would nothing I would warmly recommend to my contacts. On the other side I paid approx 75 EUR per night, which is a good deal for the area of Berlin.

Two hours later, the tour guide returned and told the front desk about the excessive heat in the room and apparently the control to the room was turned on.

Had a room facing the back so there was no noise from the street at all. Room size was good with two armchairs, a table and a flat screen TV. Beds were a little hard but the cover was very cosy. There is no in room safe but you can use the safe in the reception for free. Breakfast was included in our rate and it was great, had everything we could wish for. We used the hotel pool and sauna one evening. It was clean and nice, but quite small. There was also just one shower for the ladies to share and afterwards you had to walk through the pool area to get to your locker. My overall impression is that Hotel Mondial is a comfortable hotel that provides what you are paying for - a four star Hotel experience. Just remember - Ku'Damm is a fashionable shopping street. If you are interested in the history and culture of Berlin, all the main sights are in the formal east, in a district called MItte.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel but only for non-summer travel since thers is no AC!\u201d", "Author": "radiationmd", "ReviewID": "UR15160414", "Content": "Just came back from Berlin this week. This hotel, shockingly, despite calling itself a four-star hotel, did not have air-conditioning!!! I, therefore, would personally not stay in this hotel during the summer when it is warm and humid; however, they do have heaters, so a stay during cold months, like ours, is just fine as far as this issue is concerned. Another MAJOR complaint I would have is the shower doors being only half the length of the bath tub and resulting in a messy wet bathroom floor after every shower. It amazes me to see these kinds of shower doors commonly in Europe,and I just don't know what they are thinking when they build them this way and the reasoning behind it. The third negative is the lack of free-internet access, and not even having a business center, again despite calling themselves 4****. You can borrow a laptop from them and get internet for a considerable fee. To the positives: The best feature of this hotel was its location. Besides being in the middle of Ku'dam, its accessibility from the airport was unbelievable. You can get to the Hotel from TX airport with just one bus (#109) which drops you off right in front of the Hotel and can go back the same way, and it will only cost you 2.1 Euros and take you about 20 minutes!! And the closest metro station is about 3 blocks (salvingiplatz), ie 5 minute walk and you can even walk to the Zoo train station within 15 minutes by foot. And the area is very safe and nice and you walk through shopping areas so the walk goes by quickly. The Room was very clean, but the first time I entered, the hotel did smell somewhat musty (mild) and humid and \"old\". The second time, I could not smell much maybe because my nose had become saturated, but, anyway, it was not bothering us anymore. The furniture is a little old and feels somewhat 70's and 80's, but surprisingly in pretty good shape . They don't have king beds, they put two twin beds next to each other and call it a \" standard double\"!! We stayed at three german hotels during our trip, and they were all this way. The breafast was very good and we pigged out on it every morning so much that we could not eat lunch and it was more like a brunch for us. Overall, by US standards, this is a 3-star hotel and not a four-star one. In the US, we probably would have paid around 150-200 dollars for this kind of accommadations in any US major city in non-peak times in mid-april, but we paid a 150 Euros per night, which given the exchange rate, came to around 250 dollars, so perhaps a little expensive for a 3*** hotel. Overall, however, we had a good stay and I would highly recommend this hotel for a non-summer stay, given the excellent location, the breakfast, and the nice staff, but definitely not when it is warm since there is no AC unless you can sleep in a hot and humid room or are ok with opening windows and don't mind the noise.", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "pkbpkb", "ReviewID": "UR13550706", "Content": "I booked the mondial because of its location, the reviews on this website and the fact that it had a pool. Well, the pool is pretty small, so good for a wake-up splash in the mornings, really. The location is very good, being just by a tube stop on the Ku'Damm and within easy walking distance of good shopping and restaurants in Charlottenburg. The room was enormous, as was the bathroom, and looked out over the Ku'Damm. It was certainly better than average as far as size and comfort were concerned. One major disadvantage for any business traveller is that there is NO WLAN access in the rooms. This is only available in the lobby, so once the receptionist had entered the mac-address of my laptop on their network I was able to access the internet from the lobby. There were no tea & coffee making facilities in the room, so for a late-night coffee, it was necessary to ask for room service. A few times it seemed to me as though some of the staff were not naturally helpful as you might expect them to be in a hotel. That, as well as the non-internet access, was the negative of our stay.
