The hotel turned out to be an incredible value for the price we paid. The lobby and furnishings are very modern and classy, despite being billed as a 3 star hotel. The hotel provides free wired and wireless internet, free printing services and complimentary cookies and lemonade in the afternoon. My rate was originally booked as a king room, but upon check in the front desk was more than willing to switch us to a room with two queens instead. In fact every time we entered or exited the hotel we were greeted with a smile and someone asking if there was anything we needed. Our room was comfortable and came with the usual amenities, mini fridge, safe, ironing board, coffee maker, work desk, etc. The beds even have a mattress control that allows you to change the firmness of the mattress. A very nice and unexpected perk. The bathroom and shower were also spacious. My two complaints with the hotel would be the noise from the club next door and the exorbitant price for parking. The hotel seems to share its courtyard with Generations Hall and our room overlooked the courtyard. We could hear general chatter from people outside. Also, the hotel charges about $30 per day for parking. In my opinion this is too much to pay in the warehouse district of Nola. There is a parking garage across the street that only charges $20 for overnight parking and there are also plenty of meter spaces around for overnight parking as well. Overall I would highly recommend this Hilton Garden Inn and would certainly stay again on return trips to NOLA.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Star T", "ReviewID": "UR137890442", "Content": "This hotel was clean.

To make a long story short, we returned from our honeymoon to find that an employee STOLE my car. My car was used the entire week we were gone and over 500 miles put on my 2010 camry. My wedding dress, guest book, flowers and other personal stuff was put in back in my car after the wedding so it didn't get messed up on the cruise. The theif smoked in my car, spilled stuff, left cigarette butts in the back seat and then covered it with my wedding dress!! The smell of stale cigarettes and beer was horrible!! The front grill was knocked out, underneath my car is all beat up, several scratches, a dent in my door and left me having to get a wheel alignment. Securtiy cameras in the hotel parking garage proved that my car WAS used without my authorization, and it has now been 2 months and nothing has been done. A claim was sent to the hotels insurance company however when submitted it didn't go through. It was then stated that the hotel didn't have that type of coverage and would now have to be sent to valet. But that hasn't been done, the phone numbers I was given for the valet on my report and by the hotel are no longer in service. The hotels GM doesn't return phone calls, I get stuck talking to his assistant who is no help at all and seems to think this is no big deal. Instead of treating me as if I were the criminal everytime I call, try fixing the problem!!! I would not recommend this hotel to anyone! It doesn't matter how clean, or how many renovations are done.

After having no problems in several HGIs, except one that \"wheezed\" when we sat or moved around on it, I got careless and ended up with the same problem we'd had in a Tampa HGI a couple of months earlier. The mattress leaked and formed a depression when you sat or lay on it. Once again, it was about midnight when we made the discovery and we didn't feel like getting dressed and moving, so we decided to tough it out. The first time my husband agreed to sleep in the \"trench\" but this time I took the bad side. I probably spent more than half the night in the middle of the bed, which meant that the mattress space we shared was less than the area of a double. Uncomfortable night for both of us. The experience confirmed my suspicion that Hilton was probably sold a bill of goods with these mattresses. It seems to us that considering the problems many hotels have with keeping the air conditioning, shower heads, drains, lamps, etc., in working order, adding beds that require maintenance and repairs to the mix isn't so wise. The Tampa HGI with the leaking mattress refunded our night's stay, but this hotel seemed somewhat dismissive of the problem and mostly queried us on whether everything else was okay. (Though they did give us some extra points for the stay.) Since then I have read about other people who have had problems with \"broken\" adjustable beds (one amusingly describing the mattress as doing \"a Mariana Trench impression\"), so I'm afraid these mattresses are going to influence my HGI stay decisions greatly. Two defective out of seven adjustable beds, particularly considering that they're relatively new, doesn't bode well for the future. And having to immediately lie on the bed for the several minutes (they seem to deflate slowly, not instantly) upon entering the room is an aggravation we don't really need. Otherwise the hotel was fine. Clean and attractive lobby and rooms. Not as convenient to the Quarter as some, it's still walking distance (though a longer walk than some might like and not nearly as close as the Hilton we moved to the next night). Convenient to some fairly good restaurants. (\"Fairly good\" in New Orleans would be \"great\" in most other cities.) Rates were reasonable at this time of year.

Over an hour is way too long to wait, especially since we ordered early and they were not busy when we ordered. One word of caution though, the menus in the rooms must be old, the prices were more expensive (few dollars per entree) and they \"no longer served\" several items on the menu.

The first 5 were for business the last two were vacation time. I picked this hotel based on the recommendations posted here and its location close to the convention center. A note about the Convention Center: though this hotel seems to be the closest, that Convention Center is HUGE. It may have taken me 5 min to walk to it, but since my meeting was held at the far end, another 10 min or more time was need to get where I needed to go along with 6,000 others. This hotel was a disappointment for me. With business travel I have become a fan of Hilton hotels compared to other chains and the recommendations on here led me to believe this would live up to my other Hilton experiences in other Garden Inns and Embassy Suites. Not so. The front desk staff was disorganized for check in and there was not big line waiting, just me and one other person. I am a Hilton Honors member and they failed to inform me that I could get 2 complimentary waters per day from the pantry or give me them at check in. I was told by another guest. My room was 642. Ok in size and facing the rear of the hotel, into the small courtyard. This was a quiet room with the exception of the night club- Metropolitan- that is in the warehouse directly behind the hotel. At night, even from the 6th floor, the pounding of music, loud talk, etc could be heard. It was muffled enough most of the time by my room height to not be bothersome, but I would not want to have been on a lower floor facing that. This was supposed to be an Evolution Room with this fantastic bed and bedding. I don't think adjusting the bed firmness worked and the sheets were thin, scratchy and would had black marks on them, even after new sheets were put on. I like that they try to be more green by giving you the option to have your sheets changed by putting the card on the bed, but I lacked instructions in the bathroom as to how they handle towels. From another guest, I know their bathroom contained instructions. They would also better serve the \"greening\" world by offering a different brand of toiletries. The carpets in this hotel, especially the hallways, desperately need to be replaced. They are stained and dirty. I know many would say, \"What do you expect in New Orleans? A place that is a party all the time!\", but this is the Central Business District, not the French Quarter. A $200+ a night Hilton hotel. That caters to business travelers. No excuse. I was in a non-smoking room but had smoke smell coming into the room from either the smoking floor below (2nd floor) or a misbehaving guest. I did not realize this hotel still had a smoking floor and will avoid hotels that do if at all possible in the future. When I complained to the front desk, they were nice about it, but nothing could really be done except change my room. I figured smoke from the smoking floor was not going to choose rooms, so I stayed in the room I had already settled in to. You have to pay per day for use of the safe, but the internet access was free and a very welcome amenity. The fitness center was in a temporary location and I did not use it or the pool. Breakfast was overpriced and not all that great, though the staff was very friendly. The coffee was absolutely awful every day. Go to Caf\u00c3\u00a9 du Monde, Jacques Imo's, Gumbo Shop, Acme Oyster Bar, Mother's for some great food and ambiance....unfortunately none of these are very close to the hotel. Nearby is a great little pizza place called Pi (the mathematical symbol) and Pasta. The Riverwalk Streetcar is not too far away and will take you into the French Quarter.

So many positives here at this hotel. Now, a little nitpicking. The showerhead was stuck on buttkicking mode, and was easliy the most painful shower I've taken in a while! (LOL) It also could not be adjusted since it was not tight and would simply twist off. The bar closed at 9PM, and was way early for me, but beer could be found in the Pantry, or a corner bar if you ventured out. Also, the channel selection was pretty lousy. A few more channels would have been nice. Also, the bed had a lot of miles on it, and could use to be retired soon. Still, the comfy blankets and pillows made up for it. These minor details aside, this place was a great quiet hotel to stay at. I was very comfortable, service was great, and it provided me nearly everything I needed to have a great stay.

That would be walk THREE blocks to the Convention center, turn left and follow the length of it being several blocks long, then you will see a sign and walk a couple more blocks until you get to the place, which is several blocks long (but I recommend it!!

As a former resident of New Orleans, I knew to ask the person who made the reservation whether or not there would be parking, and she assured me repeatedly that yes, there would be parking even though it was during Mardi Gras. But when we arrived, the valet people told us the garage was full and we were on our own. Of course there was no parking anywhere in the city, nearby hotels had reserved spaces for guests-only (as ours should have) and there was zero off-street parking for miles. Not only was there no place at all to put our car, when I went inside, the front desk worker started telling me about her own problems, that she had to park illegally and would probably get a ticket, and that I should know this during Mardi Gras. Finally, after hours sitting in front of the hotel, parked in the middle of the street with nowhere to go, the parking manager said he would make an exception for us and \"stacked\" us behind another car in the garage. He was wonderful--but I can't say the same about other staff members. I sent a formal complaint to the CEO of HIlton, and it was sent down the chain. The result--the manager of this property called me and told me that they sent letters to the guests in advance telling them there may not be spaces available. I NEVER received a letter. And while she said the staff members have been told not to complain about personal problems to guests, after I hung up, I still had a bad feeling about the property. I will say the rooms were clean, and we slept well (with the exception of an evacuation due to the fire alarm pulled by one of the guests at 2:00AM one morning.) Again, I understand that during Mardi Gras there are severe parking problems in the entire City of New Orleans, but the Hilton Garden Inn should not have guaranteed me a spot.", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Collins, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cNice stay close to convention center\u201d", "Author": "IWillDare", "ReviewID": "UR13009096", "Content": "I stayed at the Garden Inn while attending a conference at the Convention Center in New Orleans.
