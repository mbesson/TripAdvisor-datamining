There was no plug for the sink and when I asked for one, I was told there were none in the hotel. How strange. Within an hour of arriving at our room the lady from the reception came banging on our door and more or less accused us of tampering with the smoke alarm, we did no such thing. She tried to make out that their smoke alarms are somehow monitored and ours was being tampered with. I can only imagine this was some sort of scare tactic to stop people smoking in their rooms, which as non-smokers, we had not intention of doing.

Small (as expected) and the linens seemed to be clean (good!), but the smell was a bit off, and I could just barely walk around the room standing at a shade under 6'. Blankets and carpet appeared to be from the 70s, and while I think they make an honest effort to keep them clean, at some point one must give up (probably in the 80s). The window looks out onto a trash covered interior roof, but I could close it, if not lock, and the curtains (put in with the carpet) hid that from view. At that point, I wouldn't return, but I could live with it for a night. Then I settled in for the night, and it got bad. The double bed was simply to soft and saggy to sleep in (and the covers were a bit scary), but the single was in better shape, and fewer hiding places. I watched the tiny TV for a few minutes until in conked out, then went to sleep. It was quiet, I will credit them that.

I had to bend over to stand in front of the tiny sink (probably a 5'8\" height limit for this bathroom), and my shower from the sink turned into a very memorable experience. Obviously, I splashed some water around the 2'x4' bathroom floor, which made it very hard to keep from stepping out onto the carpet with wet feet (I could stand it with dry, but not sure what wet feet would pick up).

Obviously we were looking for quite cheap accomodation, so we decided on City Hotel Amsterdam, as it could fit us all in, and was cheap considering its location. i always check trip advisor whenever i have a trip booked, and so we were surprised (but largely amused) to hear our hotel was hated by many visitors, and some of the horror stories were terrible! i felt apprehensive about our stay, we didn't care too much, we only needed a place to crash, but still, it makes you panic that you're about to stay in a filth-ridden faulty towers. I have to say, having been, most of the negative reviews seem a bit exaggerated....City Hotel Amsterdam managed to exceed our expectations and gave us 3 nights of secure, comfortable accomodation with friendly staff and a fantastic location. Its fair to say that the decor isn't modern, but it isn't falling to pieces or anything, and its also kept very clean. We'd booked 4 rooms - a quad, 2 doubles and a twin. The quad was fantastic, i expected the room to be tiny and cramped - but it was a brillaint size, with four single beds, a small ensuite and lots of floor space. The twin room was also surprisingly big, and even had some kind of jacuzzi-bath get up! (we never tried, but i think at least 4 people would have fit in ha ha). The doubles were slightly different. The room me and my boyfriend stayed in was lovely, good size, nice bathroom - but my two other friends stayed in the box room that previous reviews have talked about. Yes the room was small, but not ridiculously small - there was still room for a decent ensuite, closet space and a desk. my friends were perfectly happy, and overall all the rooms were clean when we arrived, were cleaned daily and the towels changed. the only thing i'd say was missing from the rooms was perhaps a safe facility - we hid our money but i wasn't comfortable without somewhere secure to keep things. On the last day i noticed one of my perfumes was missing - luckily it wasn't an expensive one, but it was nowhere to be found in the room or either of our cases when we returned home and so now we feel it may have been taken. i only made it to breakfast once, but again this was good value for money - simple (eggs, bread, ham, cheese, tea/coffee and orange juice) but fine as a quick bite to eat before you start your day. the staff were also great - very friendly, spoke great english, and were happy to help whenever we needed anything. we left our keys behind whenever we went out to avoid losing them - and whenever we returned, even at 3am, there was always someone waiting at reception to let us in and return the keys. we used to luggage store on both the day we arrvied and on our last day, and again staff were very willing to help out. the location of the hotel is also good, 10 minutes walk from the centre, damrak and the rld, 5 mins to the train station, but also on a quiet street for undisturbed sleep. all we needed from our accomodation was a place to sleep, shower and get changed in. you're in amsterdam - why would you stay in your hotel!? so for our needs, the hotel was great - cheap, clean, friendly staff and breakfast included. if you're looking for a romantic getaway, obviously you'd want to focus more on the accomodation - but for a stag night, or birthday trip like ours, city hotel amsterdam is great. cheep and cheerful!! we all came back from our trip perfectly happy with the hotel, and i would definately reccomended. p.s. the stairs of death live up to their reputation!!! they're so steep its actually hilarious. but you'll soon learn that a lot of dutch stairs are exactly the same!!!", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDon't worry about the bad reviews!\u201d", "Author": "Gutterheart", "ReviewID": "UR10600030", "Content": "After booking the hotel we read the reviews on tripadvisor - usually our hotel Bible BEFORE we book!

This led through a hatch into the roof of the building, where our 3 single beds were waiting. Unlike earlier reviews, the room, sheets and towels were clean. The only problem was the heat on the first afternoon. Some thoughtful previous occupants had left us a gift of two pork pies in the fridge, and some chocolate based snacks were found in a cupboard. The breakfast was ok, no problems there. n.b. I'm NOT refferring to the previously mentioned pork pies, we decided to give those a miss! The reception staff were reasonably friendly and helpful, offering to change our reservations, as one of our party had not been able to join us. The hotel is a budget hotel, and on that basis, we couldn't find anything to complain about, cheap and cheerful really does apply to this place. It's convenient for Centraal Station, and only a few minutes walk to the bars of the RLD.

On entering reception, my first impression was that the hotel was in need of a little TLC but nothing major. This obviously wasn't a multi-national chain hotel. I shared a triple with two others while our fourth member had a double to himself. We were on the third floor, so up we went. No surprises with the first flight but flights two and three were the steepest stairs I have ever seen. They also curled around a corner and had very shallow steps which made coming down quite interesting. When we finally made the third floor our key didn't fit room 11 but there was a door marked 11A so we tried that. On opening the door we were greeted with another flight of stairs to what amounted to a loft conversion. Climbing this short staircase brought us up through a hatch into a loft which was as hot as hell. What we had was the strangest, most old fashioned and basic room I had ever paid to stay in and to be honest I wasn't very impressed. However the beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean, though mine did have old stains which hadn't washed out properly. The cross beams were a little low and were about as high as the bridge of my nose (though I am 6ft4) and the bathroom door was even lower, about shoulder high. Night time trips to the toilet were challenging and could be made slightly more so by not closing the hatch to the stairs. Had I known what it was like before I went I wouldn't have gone but actually it grew on me and the climb became something of a joke between us. It is worth bearing in mind however that if there had been a fire, there is no alternative exit from the loft.
