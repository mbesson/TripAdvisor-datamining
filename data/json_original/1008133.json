The bed was a bit on the hard side so sleep quality was not the best I have ever had. I could do with better internet access - these days people travel with two or three internet enabled devices but (like most places) you can only use one at a time here. The air conditioning seems to be switched off so there is no air circulation unless you open the window and let in the street noise together with the fresh air. The food offering is pretty bad. The breakfast buffet looks impressive but actually the quality of ingredients and materials on offer are pretty poor - better to go one of the cafes in the area for breakfast and somewhere else completely for dinner.
