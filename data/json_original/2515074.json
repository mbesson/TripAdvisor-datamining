Other things within a 5 minute walk: Pike's Place Market, ton's of great restaurants (Google Tom Douglas- he has several restaurants within walking distance, he's been featured on Iron Chef America on Food Network, check out Seatown, great place), tons and tons of great downtown shopping- The hotel is directly connected to Westlake mall so you can walk over w/o going out in the rain, plus several more within blocks. This is a Historic Hotel on the national registry, you need to know that going in because the building is old and the rooms are smaller than what you'd find in a newer modern hotel. That said, the hotel and our room were clean and well kept, and we thought the retro tile and bathtub in the bathroom were kind of refreshing and cool. The matress was a little firm for my liking, but I think that's true of most hotel mattresses.

The room was immaculate, comfortable, tastefully decorated with free wifi and a good selection of cable channels. The bed was perfect, nice sheets, super cozy blanket. Loved it. Here's an odd downside: maybe it was the size of the room, a bit small, that led to the decision to only have one bedside table. My side, the one closest to the wall had no table and only about a foot of clearance so not only did I not have a spot to put jewelry, a glass of water etc. I had to shimmy along the wall to get out of bed. I don't think too much space would be taken from the room to move the bed over a bit for a table and more walking space. Also, the walls are not very well insulated, you can hear conversations in other rooms (among other things) and one morning we were woken up by loud tapping that sounded like it was right beside our heads. It was repair work going on downstairs, discontinued as soon as we called reception so I will add the service was polite, attentive and responsive. Also, the air conditioning unit, while moderately quiet when running had a very loud pop when it turned on, which woke us up a few times during the night. The location is excellent, right next to Westlake Center, close to shopping, the monorail, attractions and really good food (not to mention a drugstore where we were able to purchase earplugs). I would've liked to see more options on their late night room service menu, they only had a cheese and fruit plate.

I stay there for business or pleasure as many of the companies I work with are also located nearby in downtown.

From the Valet to the Bellman, Front Desk and Concierge, everyone is friendly, respectful and willing to assist in any reasonable way. I recognize many of the employees from over the years, which, to me, means that there must be some employee satisfaction. Perhaps that is what puts the service over the top. I also really enjoy the atmosphere of Oliver's Restaurant at the hotel. The menu is a perfect size making for a quick and easy decision. I have tried most things on the menu and tend to like them all. My top recommendations are the crab cakes or the hamburger. Whatever you choose, get the fries as your side dish. I would travel a long way just for those. If you enjoy a cocktail, sit at the bar and watch the weather wash over the dramatically lit street sign indicating 4th and Pine Street. It is very mesmerizing at night. When I'm in Seattle my schedule is almost always overfull and I find the Mayflower Park Hotel to be a very lovely respite in the middle of it all.

We prefer this style of classical, older boutique hotel but if our room was representative the Mayflower Park is in urgent need of renovation. We had lunch in the hotel\u2019s Oliver\u2019s. The food was adequate. The sole waitress was pleasant but her appearance would be improved if she were to remove the obvious chewing gum from her mouth lacking. The waiter who delivered our meals acted as though he would have preferred to be anywhere else but working, especially serving customers.

This would aid me in seeking a refund with hotwire. Now, I don't know if they didn't posess the skills to do this or were afraid to take the initiative. They refused. Next is the scary part. I asked to speak with the supervisor and was tendered a business card with \"Chuck's\" information. Of course I called. It seems \"Charlie\" was unavailable.

It is a beautifully restored historic hotel in the heart of downtown Seattle, within walking distance of a host of shopping, dining and entertainment opportunities. With their seasonal specials and broad spectrum of complementary extras it is a very good value. Valet parking is expensive ( $29 /day) but inline with other hotels and Seattle taxes and fees are ridiculous ( not a Mayflower Park problem) The highlights: near perfect location, competently managed, excellent staff at all positions, well maintained and cleaned, have a very good restaurant ( Andaluca) and a great lounge ( Oliver's); internet / local telephone/ daily newspaper are all complementary, lots of TV channels on a modern flat screen, very good bed and linens. Some of the minor shortcomings are just because it is an historic hotel ( built in 1927 and remodeled many times): two painfully slow elevators serve the 12 floors ( at a busy time it can be a long wait); rooms come in a variety of shapes and sizes, some like ours were rather compact ( an observation not a complaint, we were offered others); the lobby men's rest room is 2 flights of stairs down ( and up), the walls are are not exactly soundproof ( our neighbor had a persistent cough). Two short comings that need to be addressed for this quality of hotel: The HVAC in our room was very noisy ( electrical contactor clanked loudly about every 15 minutes during the night when the unit came on /off and the air handler is very loud)- difficult but not impossible to address. Easy to address is the lack of shower gel in the bathroom and the tiny, medium weight bath towels- not even close to what should be offered in this quality of hotel.

As I'm an Entertainment Card member, was able to book the room for 50% off the rack rate, which was still over 20% off the seasonal rate, and there was no fee or penalty for cancellation. The hotel is actually attached to Westlake Center, which is located directly over the Westlake Transit Tunnel, through which not only the LINK rail from Sea-Tac is connected but also several city & suburban express busses pass through. As we'd arrived on the Amtrak, it was a quick (FREE!) ride from the station to the hotel. We arrived a couple of hours prior to check-in but the front desk was very accommodating & gave us a room immediately, with the offer that if we had any issues w/noise or location that they'd willingly move us to a different room. As the hotel's website said, it's decorated in a traditional style so if you're looking for ultra modern, this won't be for you. However, the decor didn't matter to us as much as location, comfort & service and this hotel has all of those in spades! The room is exactly per their website's \"Classic Guestroom\" photo: generously proportioned w/a separate walk-in closet w/safe, full entertainment armoire, work desk & seating area, the bed linens were wonderful (altho the mattress was a little too soft for my liking), and the bathroom was a decent size too. Their toiletries are very high quality Gieves & Hawkes, which I really appreciated! I also like that their shower curtain rail is curved out so there's no icky wet curtain to stick to your skin. There's plenty of counter space for personal wash bags as well. There's in-room wifi which requires a password (changed monthly) but that's already on a card w/in the room. The signal wasn't always @ full bars but never dropped. I would comment however that there's no fan in the bathroom so the mirrors get foggy, and that the towel rack/bar is located @ the back of the tub/shower enclosure itself & there's only 2 hooks which are installed @ the top of the bathroom door, thus the towels get a bit damp after a shower. Also, when I was trying to hang my towel after showering I either had to hang it over the tub (awkward reach) or jump up to try & catch the door hooks (I'm 5' tall). I would really suggest to the hotel to look @ installing some extra bars/hooks to separate the new/dry towels, which already take up all the space on the existing rack, from used/wet towels elsewhere in the bathroom. The concierge & doormen were really helpful w/dining & shopping suggestions, and due to some pretty wacky weather, we were glad to take advantage of the complimentary umbrellas which were available to guests. We didn't eat in Andaluca but did order an American Breakfast room service to share (yay for US portions!) which was very delicious & delivered promptly on a sturdy wooden tray w/linens & cutlery. We were able to request a late checkout and when I mentioned some noise from the \"Occupy Seattle\" demonstrations, the lady said we should've told them as they would have happily moved us to a room on the other side of the hotel. The noise wasn't a big deal when the windows were closed tho so I didn't feel like a complaint needed to be made. All in all, the Mayflower Park Hotel is definitely on our list when we visit Seattle again!", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pitt Meadows, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRefined Elegance in Downtown Seattle\u201d", "Author": "slmark", "ReviewID": "UR119192600", "Content": "This hotel was a great surprise.

From our initial contact with the hotel we had nothing but great experiences. When we arrived by car the front entrance staff were very prompt and professional. Our luggage was removed from our car and carried inside for us, and our car was valet parked. The staff interacted very well with our 4 year old. The front desk staff had us checked in in no time and we were off to our room! When we entered our room my wife had the best hotel surprise ever.... two bathrooms!!! I have stayed in hotels with mini suites and multiple beds before, but it was a first to have two separate 4 piece bathrooms. We had another pleasant surprise shortly after entering our room. Our child had left a small toy in the lobby while we were checking in and the staff found it right away and called us in our room to let us know they had it for us. The location of the hotel couldn't be better for the typical Seattle vacation! Pike Place Market, the Aquarium, the waterfront, etc are all within a 10 minute walk. The hotel is actually attached to the Westlake Center Mall, where the Monorail boards to take you to Seattle Center (home of the Space Needle, the Science Museum, the Experience Music Project and the Children's Museum). It literally took us only 15 minutes to travel from our hotel room to the Space Needle: We walked through the hotel into the mall, onto the Monorail, and after a 2 minute ride we were at the Space Needle. Soooo convenient! We checked out early on our last day, but still had time to explore the city. The staff held our luggage for us and let us keep our car in valet parking until 6pm, at which time we loaded up and headed home. We travel a lot and I can honestly say the Mayflower is in the top 3 hotels I have stayed in.

The bathroom was nice but the showerhead was really low so not very good for tall people. My partner is 6 feet tall so he had to stoop a little.

I don't know why I booked that, I suspect it was all that was available for my dates as I didn't need that much space. It was a large room with the bed at one end and the other end was a sitting area with small couch, coffee table and TV. The hotel was very nice, the room large, and it's a good location for sightseeing around Seattle and it is super because it is within a block of the light rail stop from the airport. The quirks I mentioned are that for this level of hotel, the TV was very small (probably a 24 inch flat screen) so that it was too small to really view from the bed, you had to be in the \"sitting area\". I've been in cheap chain motels with TV screens bigger than that. But the thing that bother me the most was that the bathroom is very weird in design, I don't know what they were thinking. There are no towel racks! So if you use a hand towel near the sink, there is nowhere to hang it, you have to drape it over the edge of the tub or something. Very strange. The only towel rack is that one at the end, inside the tub high up, where they pile extra towels at times. There isn't a single towel rack on the wall otherwise. And there is a small glass shelf over the sink (under a mirror) which sticks out over where the sink and faucet begin--so if you lean over to wash your face in the sink, you have to be careful or you hit your head. I was also very annoyed that I stressed many times that I wanted a quiet room and they gave me a room next to a couple with an infant that woke me up the first two days screaming at 4-5 am. Luckily I think they moved out after that. I think the walls are fairly thin which compounded the problem, which surprised me for a hotel of this caliber.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thailand", "Title": "\u201cWe loved it and will return.\u201d", "Author": "moleskinMary", "ReviewID": "UR115510747", "Content": "Rooms, lobby, staff, food and beverage, location; all ideal for us.

The lobby is beautiful and peaceful, and the front desk staff was very welcoming. We were given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe suite, which had a seating area and 2 bathrooms. This was perfect for 4 ladies traveling together! The location of the hotel could not be more perfect - lots of shopping and restaurants nearby, as well as only 3 blocks down to Pike Place Market. The bellboys and the concierge both gave us great suggestions for places to eat nearby. We even had two meals at Elephant and Castle we liked it so much! Another great suggestion was the Icon Grill. Great shopping in every direction from the hotel, and it is in a very safe area. We took the Light Rail from the airport to Westlake Center, and had no problem finding our way to the hotel. We chose to take a cab (town car, actually) to the airport on our way home, as we were unsure how long it would take us to catch light rail, walk to our airline check-in and get through security. I can't imagine a nicer place to stay in Seattle. The housekeeping staff even came in twice a day, with our beds turned down in the evening. The beds were very comfortable with nice pillows and bedding. We really liked the smaller hotel and felt that the attention to detail was wonderful. The hotel is also very clean, which is important to us. We enjoyed a complimentary wine tasting on Wednesday evening at the hotel, and had lunch one day at Oliver's - the hamburgers were great! Two of us got up really early every day (5:30ish) and walked all around the downtown area. We tried a different coffee shop each morning, and it was so much fun. I can't imagine anyone not being extremely pleased with this hotel - everyone we encountered was very gracious and helpful. The desk clerk even let each of us pay for one night of our stay on our credit cards so we didn't have to split the bill among ourselves! I have traveled a lot, and this hotel surpassed any other place I have stayed, especially in the price range.

There are also a lot of great cafes and restaurants within walking distance. When we arrived at the airport, we just took the light rail to the Westlake Station, and the hotel was a block away.

I booked this hotel for a one night stay in order to photograph Seattle. I try to review various hotels, especially if the experience is significant. The Mayflower Park was a massive disappointment in -Appearance -Accommodation -Most importantly, customer service. Check-in was average; however I noticed that in the \"business center\" (standing kiosks only) we could see guests conducting their business at computer stations. The room was shabby at best, and about the size of a closet. We walked in and noticed that the room was dingy, small, and had only one bed. I am disabled; room size is easy to overlook, if the room is presented acceptably and I can get around. We requested a second bed: No can do. We requested audience with a manager and let him know very clearly we were not happy. He was accusatory and combative, but kindly offered a roll-away bed. We finally conceded, and the manager continued to be combative. After that was over, we decided to see the city. Apparently the hotel was connected to access for various methods of transportation. Not for us; we were sent outside and around the building as the result of an event happening at the hotel. Again, I'm disabled which is unfortunately clearly visible. Regardless, we were sent outside in slick rain on concrete, with no assistance offered by doormen. I had to grapple down wet cement stairs and into rain. After clearing yet another flight of stairs, we made it to our transportation. Upon our return to the hotel, we called to request a roll away. After four hours and three calls to the front desk, it came. An employee set it up, and left absolutely no clear path to the restroom as a result of the small room. That is not possible for me-again, he could see that I was in need of better accommodation, so he moved furniture all over the place attempting to clear a small opening for me to reach a restroom in the night. Up to this point the entire hotel experience had not only been inconvenient, but extremely dangerous. Then our neighbors chirped in. We could hear the conversations of hotel guests in rooms next to us through the walls. The next morning, we checked out. We looked to the front desk after checkout, just in time to see the hotel's (very) young manager clearly talking about us as we walked away.

It was super handy to use the computers at the front desk for free to print reservations - the lovely Asian front desk receptionist already had my printouts on the countertop before i even had a chance to log out of the computer. The 2 door guys - sorry fellas, I didn't catch your names, but one wore glasses and always had a smile and the other was tall and dark (and handsome!) - both of you were so pleasant and professional and so prompt with welcoming me to/from the property. The room was a good size for 1 - and i had a view of the macy's downstairs. Found it confusing to get from the light rail exit to the actual hotel front door - i suppose i could have studied the map better, but really didn't know which exit i came out from. dragging my suitcase through evening traffic didn't get me off to a good start. I caught a taxi on the way back to airport and this was organised by the hotel - in fact, they actually had the hotel private car waiting and so i took this instead as it was ready to go - cost me a bit more $40? from memory but got there safe/sound early in the morning. I felt safe at all times in the hotel - despite being hassled by the usual suspects once i went out of the hotel into the masses. Had some yummy local meals - Cheesecake Factory, Palamino.

I can't speak positively enough about the location. It is in or near the center of everything touristy. The price is competitive with the chains in the market, and it's worth it to eschew earning points for a more convenient and frankly nicer room. Upon the advice of some of the other reviewers, we opted for a double queen room over the standard queen room to get more space. For an extra $20 nightly, we got two queen beds, room to spread out and two full bathrooms. The view of the surrounding area is terrific from the room, and the air condition in our room is above average. The service was prompt, gracious, and appreciative. The valet was prompt and eager. The classic elegance of the lobby and attention upon check in are not to be missed. The room itself was clean and updated. There are no plugs above desk level (important if you travel with several electronic devices), but plugs located above baseboard level all around the room more than make up for this. The HD Visio television in the room was not overly large but does the job. Curtains can be closed completely. The bed is hard, but not overbearingly so. Not great for a bad back, but it won't leave you immobilized like some other chain beds. The bathrooms are satisfactory. However, the shower head is difficult to deal with if you're taller than 5' 4\" and would be unusable for an extended stay if you are exceptionally tall (they are fine, however, for persons of size). The bathrooms in our room were not vented, and that lends to giving the rooms a dirtier appearance. It appears as if the walls in the rooms and their respective doors had been neither painter nor cleaned in quite some time. Skip the room service from Oliver's. Delivery was prompt and the price was reasonable but the food was not very good. For those of us who are late risers, the noon check out time is appreciated.

We had arrived at 1:00 in the morning very tired and needing a good nights rest. The gentleman at the desk also gave a a very big welcome and proceeded to check us in quickly and afficiently Upon hearing that we were there celebrating our anniversary he gave us a certificate for 2 free cocktails in their wonderful martini cocktail lounge. What a nice way to start our stay! We found our room a mini king size suite to be beautiful, comfortable, very clean and quiet. The next morning we had breakfast in their restaurant Anduluca. The breakfast choices were wonderful as were the wait staff. The breakfast was also included in the price of each night we stayed at the hotel ,which I must say is the best deal in town. Each morning we had a delicious breakfast which was prepared to a tee,(my favorite being the stuffed french toast YUM!!) and some great conversation with the wait staff. They were always helpful with ideas of things we should do or see,and all their recommendations were great. It was a nice way to start our day. The concierge, Sean, was also extremely helpful and knowledgeable. He made reservations at 2 of Seattles finest restaurants for us and we loved them both. Lets get back to LOCATION. This little grand hotel is right in the hub of all that is going on in Seattle.Shopping surrounds you,from Nordstroms, Macys, to the world famous Pikes Market which is only 2 blocks away. Great fun at Pikes and we visited it every day. The hotel is also conveniently located 1 block from the Lite Rail which is a great train ride that takes you to and from Seattles Seatac airport. It costs only $2.50 each way and we found it to be clean and comfortable. What a great perk, as a taxi ride from the airport can cost around $40. We made use of our certificate for our 2 Free cocktails at Olivers their martini cocktail lounge and once again were so happy with the service and genuine friendliness of the staff. The drinks were delish! The Mayflower Park is attached to Westlake center where there is a shuttle that will take you to the Space Needle which is just a short 3 minute ride away. You can't ask for more than this hotel offers. They are truly a great example of what a hotel stay should be like. We would recommend this hotel without hesitation to any one staying in Seattle. P.S.

I was also told at the front desk that if I wanted to a small refrigerator could be brought to my room at no extra charge! The location of the hotel was also excellent. It is centrally located and within walking distance to many great attractions. There is a shopping center (Westlake Center) very close to the hotel where you can do a lot of shopping or grab a bite to eat at the food court. On the third floor you can buy your tickets to take the monorail that takes you to the Seattle Center area where the Space Needle and other attractions are located. A few block south of the hotel you find the famous Pike Market. I strongly recommend starting your day with breakfast at Lowells Restaurant at the Pike Market. Its very affordable and the three floor restaurant has excellent views of the waterfront.

Lousy water pressure and shower The main restaurant Andalucca was closed and my Seattle friends and I had been dying to try it, as it had top reviews. Summary: I would actually rate this hotel 4****, as it was comparible with most 4**** hotels I've stayed at. The price was very fair and you absolutely can't beat the location. The rooms were an average size, as was the bathroom. Ideal for one person, however usually you don't spend much time in the room when you are on vacation!

We got lucky with the weather (it never rained) and this heritage hotel helped it be a positive experience. On check in we were initially a little disappointed that at 2 pm our room wasn't ready, the hotel didn't seem overly busy and as check out is 11 I had hoped that we would be able to get straight into our room after a lengthy flight. However as check in isn't listed as guaranteed until 4 pm we can't complain. The hotel took our number to call us when the room was ready and we headed off for the short walk to Pike Place Market. After a couple of hours the hotel never called us and this was typical of the staff there. Generally they were disinterested and for almost everything looked like too much trouble. The one exception to this was the concierge who was lovely, very friendly and helpful. Once in our room it was very large and although slightly dated, clean and everything worked. As well as a large comfortable bed there was room for a sofa, chair and plenty of room to move around. In modern hotels the space would have been partitioned and called a suite. Given such a large room the bathroom was tiny and although the fixtures were in good order, the tiny size, at odds to the room itself, was somewhat uncomfortable. The door could barely squeeze closed past the toilet howeverI guess this is typical of older properties.

In all we had 6 rooms, 3 generations. The hotel is very well located and is a very nice small hotel. The rooms and the lobby appear to have been renovated fairly recently. The lobby is small but nicely appionted. The restaurant is very nice - reasonably priced with well above average food. My wife and I requested a deluxe queen. The hotel only advertised that they had 3 types of rooms - Standard queen, Deluxe queen (larger) and Double queen. Upon arrival were were put into a King room (the clerk explained that they only have about a half dozen king rooms) Our room was very large - could have accomodated another King with adaquate walking room remaining. The double queen rooms appeared somewhat more cramped, with limited space next to the beds. As is common in older hotels, electric outlets is a bit of a challenge. No extra power near the bed, and we had to rotate power supplies to keep a laptop, cell phone and blackberry's all charged. One significant negative is the very VERY small bathrooms. A tub, sink and camode with room to stand is all you get. Nice shampoo and conditioner in large wall mounted pump bottles in the shower, a bar of soap and towels. No extras. My mother in law complained that there was nowhere to hang a towel - the only towel bar is in over the bathtub. The only other significant complaint is that the 2 very small elevators are inadaquate to service the 10 floor hotel. 4 - 5 minute waiting times were normal during peak hours. Each elevator can handle only 6 people at a time so arriving at the lobby to find 10 people waiting (happened more than once in our week long stay) resulted in an unacceptable wait. One other point to note - the matresses are rather firm. Great for my wife, not so great for me. I would probably stay here again, the location, amazing service and charm are worth the small bathroom.

I had written to the hotel before our stay telling them about our celebrations and asking if they could just put a note on my husband's pillow ( 'The best husband in the world sleeps here') or something similar. They claimed not to have received my e mail and had no knowledge of a similar note added to our booking form and couldn't care less that our room and the lack of attention has spoiled the stay for me even before it started. I commented in a disappointed way rather than complain as I didn't want to make things uncomfortable for my husband. But there was no apology-just defensiveness. We were rather begrudgingly given a free drink in the bar as compensation. The bar, however, ( Olivers) is fabulous-best martini ever. The staff here were friendly and delightful and the restaurant was great. The hotel is also very central-right next to the Westlake Centre and transport links. We made the best of the room as it was obvious that there was no point in commenting further and I didn't want to spoil our trip.

I have stayed here before for one night prior to taking a cruise to Alaska. This time time stayed 4 nights just to seed the sights around Seattle. The Mayflower Park is one of only two hotels in Seattle that is listed as a historical hotel. In was built in the 1920's and is a beautiful property. I stayed in what the hotel calls the classic room. It is a comfortable room with one queen bed. The room is not huge but comfortable for two people. Even though we were on the 10th floor we could still hear the traffic in the morning. It wasn't a big deal but be aware you are downtown and you will hear the commute traffic in the morning. The bathroom was also nice and has body soap and shampoo supplied by the hotel. They are in big containers on the wall in the shower. I liked that touch because I hate trying in open those little plastic shampoo containers. The hotel has a great bar on the first floor. They are well known for martini's if that is your drink. They always were busy each night so the locals and hotel guests must have liked their drinks. What is really nice about this hotel is the location. You are right downtown and have access to everything. The monorail is within the same block. This monorail is a direct link to the Space Needle. Also you have the last stop of the Seattle Light Rail one block away. This is a great benefit. Let me explain. We arrived at the SEATAC Airport and proceeded to the light rail station which is at the airport. Now get this, the fare from the airport to downtown Seattle is only $2.50. There are only 9 stops from the airport to the last station which is Westlake. Only a block from the Mayflower. This trip only takes 35 minutes. Get this, the trains are not crowded. I don't think most travelers know about the light rail system. It opened in December 2009 and it still is not crowded. It was easy to bring our luggage on the train and comfortably ride to Seattle. Also, the trains are new and the seats and interiors are clean and there is no grafitti. Also, the people I saw riding the train were travelers from the airport and people coming or going to work. I strongly suggest you ride the train. Can't beat it for the money and it takes you downtown. The last station is at 5th and Pine which is close to the Mayflower, Westin, and other hotels. Another great tip. If you want to go up the Space Needle make reservations at the Sky lounge to eat. This will save you the $15 per person to go up to the viewing level. With lunch at the restaurant they give you a free ride up. The food at the restaurant is a little expensive but it is good. So you can eat and get a great view. The restaurant turns and it takes 47 minutes to make a complete revolution. You will see the 360 degree view of the Seattle area. Last but not least. There are a few great restaurants just a block from the Mayflower Hotel. Everyone in Seattle knows Tom Douglas for his eating establishments. He is know for great food and I agree. On 4th and Virginia Streets he has two restaurants which I recommend. One is called Dahlia Lounge and right across the street is Lola's. I didn't eat at the Dahlia but I has breakfast two days in a row at Lola's. I fell in love with their granola with greek yoghurt. The granola is homemade and to die for. Another restaurant that is between 3rd and 4th street on Virginia is called Serious Pie. This is a great pizza place. Check it out on the internet. Ate there two nights and they have great pizza. The staff is very friendly and they make sure you have a good time. The pizza crust is very thin and they only use applewood to heat their oven to cook the pizza. So to end this.

Housekeeping called to check if we wanted our room cleaned and just asked that we let them know if we wanted towels or anything. -Good pressure and temp in the shower at any time of day. -Good WiFi. Just call down to the front desk for the password. NEGATIVES -the pillows were way too soft! my neck hurt by the end of the trip and we had too much stuff to travel with to bring my own pillow. this is just my opinion, though. -They got rid of the vending machines. You could either buy a $4 bottle of water in the room (not worth it), or hike it a few blocks to Ralph's market where you can buy the same water for half the price. -We went to eat at Oliver's lounge, attached to the hotel. The menu at the lounge was not the same as the one in the room and we ended up not being able to eat anything there. -no room service except for breakfast. -the bathroom is a little tight. the toliet is practially up against the wall.

It actually wasn't much larger than our cabin on the cruise ship. It was comfortable, clean. Late that afternoon, after exploring Seattle, we decided to rest in our room. We looked in the hotel directory and my husband went to find a vending machine so we could enjoy a soft drink. There weren't any to be found.

We were on the 10th floor with peak-a-boo views of the Sound and Lake Union. There was some construction noise from 4th Ave but it didn't start at an outrageous time. The only minuses of the hotel are the small bathrooms, which I find livable, and some noise from adjoining rooms. I did need earplugs our second night as our neighbor seemed to be on an all night bender. My wife lived in Seattle for 8 years and I lived there for 2 and we both love the location of the hotel. It's an easy walk to the Market but not so close that you get the noise and crowds. It's also close to lots of bus lines (and light rail, in a few weeks). We had a rental car for two nights so we could visit some favorite haunts around the city that are a little harder to get to by bus. I was pleasantly surprised that parking was only $15 a night -- I've paid much, much more at city center hotels. There's an Enterprise a few blocks away on Westlake, so it's easy to beat the extra taxes from an airport rental. We skipped Andaluca this time as we have other favorites downtown. My all-time favorite breakfast in Seattle is Lowell's at the Market. Get there early for window seats on the third floor, which have stunning views of the Sound.

Upon our arrival, check-in was excellent. The front desk was extremely helpful, we used the valet service and it was $15 for 24 hours with unlimited in-out privileges. Considering that the hotel was on 4th Avenue. It was an awesome deal. When we got to our room, it was on the 11th floor (the hotel only has 12 floors), the front desk had booked us into a quiet corner suite and the room was immaculate. Others mention that it was smaller but for a married couple, it was just fine. The bed was comfortable, the sitting area with the TV and the desk with the mirror was helpful for putting on makeup since the bathroom didn't have much counterspace. The bathroom was small but had all the essentials. A good flowing shower, plenty of towels, complimentary products and bathrobes. We only stayed for one night so we didn't even use all the products but it was definitely great. Keep in mind, this hotel was built back in the 20's (i think) and it has been renovated a few times but the essence of the old-school style wasn't lost but it didn't feel dated or grungy at all, in fact, we felt like it was a great little getaway hotel that was close to the main downtown Seattle area. The lobby lounge, Oliver's, has really good martinies, they have won competitions for it. It was really nice also with the big windows and the high ceilings because you could watch people walking by and enjoy a tasty drink at the same time. A great before-dinner option. The concierge was extremely helpful, he gave us some options for how to spend the night and we gave him ideas of what we wanted to do and he gave us suggestions that fit it perfectly. The restaurant Andaluca's, we didn't go to but supposedly they have the best mediterranean, we will definitely check it out next time we visit. Overall, our stay at Mayflower was excellent. We would highly recommend. Even though it is rated 3.5 stars, it could be 4 stars for sure but since it is rated 3.5 i guess you are even more pleasantly surprised.

On a positive note the hotel is in a great location which would be difficult to beat. In short the hotel is ok however it was not a tough decision to try another hotel and I would not stay at the Mayflower again unless my first choice (The Vintage Park) was not available.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "roanoke, virginia", "Title": "\u201cthree nights of sound sleep!\u201d", "Author": "saoirse7", "ReviewID": "UR25610741", "Content": "Stayed three nights, in a corner suite on the 12th floor.

The hotel is connected to the Westlake Shopping Center which has a good food court as well as shops, the monorail station and an underground bus station. Many times we didnt even have to use the street level to get to where we were going thanks to this direct link. The staff were very friendly and helpful, nothing was a problem for them and they genuinley made us feel welcome. The room itself was perfect, not large but room enough to move. The bathroom was just right and there was plenty of closet space, a safe and tea and coffee facilities - filter coffee I might add, no dreadful sachets of instant Nescafe. Our room was spotless and the housekeeping staff were so cute in their black and white maids' uniforms. We had trouble with the combination lock on the safe (our error, not the safe's) and within a few minutes of reporting it, a maintenance man appeared and fixed it. He even refused the tip I offered! The only negative aspects concern the TV - an old fashioned bulky set that had poor reception on many channels, but that wasnt a major issue as we werent on holiday to watch TV. The only other problem is thin walls. If a neighbouring guest has a shower at 3am, you might hear it. I was woken in the middle of the night by a mobile phone ringing in the next room. But if you're a heavy sleeper that shouldnt be an issue. Generally everything was calm and quiet at night, no real noise from the street. A big plus is the two free internet terminals in the lobby.

I had booked their Rise and Shine package, so we had a delicious breakfast sent up to our room every morning. And it's true what others say---Olivers is great! We enjoyed their cocktails (especially the infused Bloody Mary) each night before having dinner in town. The front desk staff and concierge was very helpful and polite. We got a room on the 12th floor in the corner, so we had great views. Although the room was smaller than an average sized hotel room, it suit our needs perfectly. Also, at the suggestion of others on tripadvisor we took the Downtown Airporter through Grayline for $18 each, roundtrip. It picked up/dropped off at the Westin less than 2 minutes away from the Mayflower Park. This was a super easy alternative to taking a cab from the airport/downtown. We had considered renting a car, but glad we didn't in the end. Everything was easy to get to without a car. Location wise the hotel was perfect for our needs. We walked to the Pikes Place Market everyday. Also, having the monorail and Westlake Center (food court/shopping) attached to the hotel made travel to Seattle Center easy. We celebrated one night with dinner at the Space Needle restaurant. It is overpriced as other say, but it was worth the experience and views. Plus you have to consider the $16 per person you'd spend just to go up it, so it worked out! We also went on the Savory Seattle Food tour through The Pikes Place Market and it was great!

This boutique-style hotel provided impeccable attention to detail. From the front-desk staff, to the valet parking staff, to the concierge services, to the housekeeping staff--everything was top-notch. If you're looking to be in the heart of Seattle, this location can't be beat. The hotel is directly across the street from Macys and is connected to the Westlake Center on the Mezzanine level. We were only four blocks from Pikes Market and were within walking distance to the Space Needle and the big REI store. We booked a Corporate Comforts package, which rolled the parking right into our nightly rate. Our first night was $199, and the subsequent nights at $181 (plus taxes)--so it was an amazing value for the location. We had a corner guestroom, which was actually two separate rooms. The main room had a large sofa, chair, ottoman, table large television/armoire, wet bar with mini-sink, mini-frig, and work desk. Complimentary high-speed internet was provided for our laptop. We needed a roll-away brought in for our daughter for a couple of nights, and there was plenty of space for that in the front room. The roll-way was not your typical \"folded-up\" bed, but a thick twin-size mattress on a platform. One large window in each room faced west, plus one additional large window in the main room faced north. There was a glass-paneled door connecting the two rooms. The bedroom had a king-size bed with a heavy comforter and a down-filled blanket. Six Pacific Coast down pillows were on the bed. Also in this room were a wooden valet, large dresser, two nightstands, and a high-definition television. The bathroom was located off the bedroom. Although not overly large, it was well appointed with very nice toiletries. A hair dryer, iron and ironing board were located in the closet, as were two robes. Considering we were in the heart of downtown, we really didn't hear much noise at night--other than an occasional siren. The rooms are very well sound-proofed, and we didn't hear anyone next to us or on the floor above. The nightly turn-down service was a nice surprise. There were individual heating/cooling controls in each of the rooms, which allowed us to adjust each room independently. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant, so we can't comment on that. There are many dining places closeby, including several Starbucks, many take-out places in the Westlake Center, and a Cheesecake Factory a few blocks away. This hotel would not be particularly attractive for families with young children--especially if you need a pool or game area. It would be a great match for most other travelers if you're looking for a unique hotel with great service.

We were in room 711, seventh floor, two queen beds, one bathroom. The hotel is historic -- built in 1927, and it was the first Seattle hotel to have all rooms en suite (private bathrooms in each room). The hotel has all the ups and downs of a fine quality historic hotel. We loved the charm and the location, and the value it offers. Upscale newer chain hotels (Marriott, Westin, Hyatt) were at least $100 more per night. Pluses: 1. Location. You can walk to Pike Place Market and take the monorail right from the hotel to Seattle Center (Space Needle and some very cool music and science fiction museums). Original Nordstrom is right across the street, and all the upscale shops are within walking distance. 2. Old hotel charm. In buckets. The staff was very nice, everything seems gilded. The martini bar is quite charming -- the first to have a clear window onto the street. Nice restaurant attached. 3. Valet parking is spot on efficient -- even though it was $26 per day. 4. Overall value is excellent based on cost of other hotels in area. 5. Our double queen room was HUGE. Bathroom, small, but lots of space in the room. Minuses: 1. Noise. Hey, it's downtown and on the main bus line with police sirens at night. Seventh floor -- still noisy -- we asked for a ''quite'' room -- perhaps one in the back would have been better, the staff offered to move us but we didn't push it, we were there one night only. 2. Our queen bed was horrid. I ended up sleeping on the floor to save my back. It sagged in the middle and was way too springy-soft. Our son loved it, however. You might want to ask if any of the rooms have newer beds. 3. Really small bathrooms with really short shower heads. People were shorter and not used to fancy bathrooms in 1927, obviously. Mayflower does its best with what it has, however. Final note: We walked for an hour to look for breakfast on a Friday morning. This is a business district with retail hours.

We had a king bed, and near the bed area was the large walk in closet (with bathrobes for our use) and the bathroom. The bathroom was a tad small, but not cramped. Everything was nicely appointed and extremely well maintained. Our room looked out to the street towards the old Bon store (now Macy's), so at the holidays it would be a very nice view.

Secondly, the mens room is up the stairs, across the lobby and down the stairs on the other side-- only the women's restaurant is adjacent to the meeting room. Finally, getting everyone's luggage out after the meeting was too much for 2 people. Chaos ensued for those running to catch a plane. As far rooms go, I was told I had an upgrade (Room 321). Apparently, I had a little more bathroom space. Unfortunately, the upgrade ended there, since I had a view of the hotel airconditioning unit, light well and having the hotel's mechanical power supply and hydraulic units kick on every few minutes did not allow a great night sleep. If you are given a room that looks into the lightwell, turn around and ask for a room that fronts the streets. You will be Sleepless in Seattle and highly disappointed if you dont. While most reviews, sound good for the most part, I want TripAdvisor members to be aware of some of the issues of this 80 year old hotel. Finally, make sure you allow for 15-20 minutes for valet.

One of my few complaints about this hotel is the lack of vanity space and the very low water pressure (at least on the 10th floor.) I am not sure exactly how many rooms have this double bathroom feature, but I would ask about it if I were booking here again. The hoitel is located right next to the Monorail to visit EMP and the Space Needle. We all enjoyed EMP. Views from the top of the Needle were gorgeous and we were able to see all the way to Canada and all of the surrounding snow covered mountains. The Mayflower Park is very well located to ALL of the major shopping and just a few blocks from Pikes Place Market and lots of great places to have dinner. We really enjoyed Etta's Seafood. It had a great Seattle vibe, and something for everyone. Our best breakfast was sharing a bag of just fried dounut holes from a vendor at Pikes Place Market and coffee. As I said before, I had few complaints. I do see room for improvement in two areas: better beds (they move ALOT when ever your partner moves) and larger bath towels would be nice. My husband and I had cocktails down at Oliver's in the lobby. Nice bar. We did have a forgettable breakfast at the hotel and did not return to eat any other meals there. Having access to free wireless in our room was nice, too.

We understand that the hotel was close to being torn down when it was rescued and completely renovated by a local group. It is now an independently-owned hotel in the style of upscale classic city hotels, entirely non-smoking and in the heart of downtown Seattle within several blocks of Pike\u2019s Market. For those who shop, it is convenient to major chain stores (Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom etc), and opens directly from the lobby into Westlake Center (an indoor multi-story shopping mall). Room costs vary and one can find bargain rates via the internet as we did. Our room had two queen beds, a large desk with drawers for clothing, an armoire with TV above and more drawers below, a coffee maker (with regular and decaf coffee and tea provided). There was no mini-fridge \u2013 though we did not ask to see if one might be provided on request. The bathroom had a tub/shower and single sink, with 3 sets of thick towels (for two people). The d\u00e9cor was tasteful and attractive \u2013 dark wood Chippendale-style furniture in excellent condition, tasteful carpeting and drapes. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. I communicated with one concierge by email and phone and she responded quickly and fully to my questions about transportation from the airport. The concierge on duty during our stay responded to our queries with enthusiasm \u2013 calling a place we asked about visiting to make sure they would be open, making dinner reservations on our behalf, recommending another excellent restaurant and suggesting a theatre performance that we thoroughly enjoyed. Transportation from the airport is available by taxi, shuttle, and Grayline hotel bus. The latter is by far the least expensive for one person traveling alone (less than half of the shuttle cost, and about a third of the taxi fare) but stops at the Westin Hotel which is a short 1.5 blocks from the Mayflower Park. The short walk is slightly uphill and is very easy with a small roll-on suitcase. The hotel has its own parking garage on site. The hotel has an attractive bar and a restaurant, but no souvenir or other shop. For toiletries and the like, there is a drugstore a half block away from the Mayflower Park. For other items, there is the small but well-stocked gourmet Ralph\u2019s Grocery & Deli about two blocks away from the hotel on 4th Avenue. Ralph\u2019s has a good selection of local Washington state and other wines, cold beer, and makes sandwiches to order as well as selling other grocery items.

( I was taken by the price difference of about 250 dollars/night) From the moment we booked the room, to the time we left, we found the Mayflower Park to be an exceptional boutique hotel. I was first impressed by the lobby decor and lighting, and a front desk staff that was polite, welcoming and very efficient. we had a corner room which was smaller than an average room, but very very clean and delightful. It reminded us of some very good hotels we stayed in Paris, but half the cost. Dinner at Andalucas was remarkable. The ambiance, impeccable service, friendliness and price were all well within the range of excellent. I had the quail, which I must add, was fantastic. After seeing \"White Christmas\" at the 5th Ave Theatre (beautiful show and theatre) we walked back to the Mayflower Park to be once again welcomed by the front desk staff who inquired about our evening at the show. The fact they take an interest in what we do while staying in the neighborhood makes me feel like a valued customer. Bed was very comfortable. bathroom, clean as any can be. Overall room appeal was great, and with a corner room you may find a bit more street noise, but I still say it is worth it. I can highly recomend this hotel for anyone. I do not however recomend it if you have children, as some guests, and the closeness of the rooms might make your children feel out of place and unwanted.

The biggest problem was that our room's air conditioning was not working. It was close to 80 degrees in the room. An engineer came up twice, but the problem was never fixed. Ultimately, the engineer admitted to us our room had a problem as did another room on our floor. We had to ask to be moved to another room -- no offer was made. The substitute room looked out at a brick wall. It appeared to be a single -- full bed, not queen; one nightstand; no table by the reading chair as in our first room. The room rate was adjusted down, but it was a lesser room, so it just ended up feeling like the hotel didn't care more than the minimum necessary. On Sunday, our room was not made up until 4:30 in the afternoon, after we had been out all day and returned hoping to relax for a while. When our bill was prepared, we were incorrectly double-charged. The hotel provides one computer for free internet access, but it is not easily found and no one told us about it. Not awful problems, just annoying. The Mayflower is a place with lots of brass trim, big flower arrangements in the lobby, and you have to call room service if you want ice. If that's your style, and if the air conditioning in your room is working, I think you'll find the Mayflower to be a fair choice.

We always try to stay at historic hotels if possible, instead of the cookie cutter big box hotels where you would be hard-pressed to know what city or state you were in. We read the reviews of the Mayflower Park Hotel on Trip Advisor, then found their website on the Internet. I was hesitant about staying here at first, after reading Trip Advisor reviews about the small rooms and bathrooms. When I called to get more information, I was told by reservations that the deluxe rooms were about 100 square feet larger then the classic rooms. I knew through my research that all hotel rooms in downtown were very expensive, and I was pleasantly surprised to be told that with an AAA or AARP discount of 30%, the rate for the deluxe room would be $179 instead of $255. I reserved a deluxe room with a queen bed for 2 nights prior to the cruise, and for 1 night after we returned. I then received an immediate confirmation by e-mail. The Mayflower Park was the best of all the places we have stayed in the Historic Hotels of America group. The restoration/renovation of the hotel is beautiful and everything about our stay was fabulous! We arrived from the airport shortly after noon, and were surprised to find our room ready for an early check-in. Check-in was a breeze and our luggage was quickly brought up to our room. Our room was beautiful and very large! Room 815, which was on the northwest corner, faces Macys to the west and had a view of the Space Needle to the north, although the flagpole atop of the flatiron building next door competed somewhat with the Space Needle view. We also had a small glimpse of the snow covered Cascades between the city\u2019s high-rises. This corner room was bright with 3 sets of windows, very spacious and beautifully decorated. Queen bed, 2 bedside tables, armoire with television, 2 upholstered chairs with a table in-between, and a desk with chair in an extended area that also had a wet bar with granite countertop, a small under counter refrigerator and a coffee maker. The coffee packs that were furnished were without a doubt the best hotel room coffee I have ever had! Bathrobes, hair dryer, ironing board and iron were in the closet (small) and the bathroom was also somewhat small, but beautiful with a new pedestal sink, large tub and a great showerhead. The only drawback here was the close placement of the toilet between the tub and the door. Not much wiggle room there! The toiletries that were furnished were top of the line. When the bellman brought our luggage, he told us that the rooms that ended in the number 15 (815, 915, 1015, etc.) were all the same large corner rooms. The front desk called a couple of minutes later to ask if we needed anything, and the only thing I requested was to have the same room for the following Sunday night, after we returned from our cruise. We were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go in the downtown area. Pike Place Market was just 3 blocks away. See\u2019s Candies was 1 block. We also walked to Pioneer Square, the Smith building, the new library and the ferry terminal to Bainbridge. We took a city bus up to the Seattle Center, and then walked up to Lake Union for the Wooden Boat show. Weather was gorgeous! Would I stay at the Mayflower Park again? You bet!

When we went in the room our first reaction was good....we got the deluxe room/with parking, which is a queen sized bed (although it looked like a double) and a little sitting area. The down sides started at about 10:00 at night since our room was located right by a stockroom so basically until 12:00am/1:00am there was a very loud noise outside our bedroom of whatever or whomever was working out in the hallway. As well, we were on the 8th floor and we could still hear all the noises out on the street?? Insulation not so great? You could also hear doors slamming and water running. Upon investigating a bit found bathroom was very small....my husband at 6'1 had to crouch down to take a shower since the showerhead was quite low. The check in/out agents were not the friendliest, but were friendly enough. I think that with the amount of $$$ this hotel charges it is more for the location than the service or quality of room. The reasoning for my review is that we actually stayed at the Holiday Inn in Downtown Everett the night before at 1/3 of the price (it is only 1/2 hour from downtown Seattle) and the service was 100% better, as well as our room was bigger (king size bed) and the bathroom was double the size.

We'd definitely consider staying at this hotel again.", "Date": "September 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cMayflower Park Hotel-Great Location, Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "berwind", "ReviewID": "UR3836989", "Content": "We enjoyed a two night stay at the Mayflower Park Hotel in August, 2005. While it was a busy time in Seattle (The Ring Cycle was at the opera that week) we were upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise. We had a wet bar with coffeemaker, mini-refigerator and sink, large living area with desk (free wireless internet access too, very nice), sofa and comfy chairs, king bed, large closet/dressing room, and nice bathroom though small, but with historic fittings. The Hotel is a member of the Historic Hotels of America, and the lobby is small but evokes a historic feeling. Another nice bonus was the invitation to the Wednesday early evening wine tasting and hors d'oeuvres in the restaurant, Andalucia. Very pleasant experience. We didn't have time to use the fitness center, but the hotel's location right in the center of town provided us lots of exercise walking up and down Seattle's hills. We walked to REI, the Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and even the Victory Brewery from the hotel. The front desk and bell staff were particularly helpful, and the host at the wine tasting was very pleasant. We would certainly recommend the Mayflower Park Hotel and will definitely stay there again-there was so much to see and do in Seattle, we barely scratched the surface!", "Date": "September 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fargo, ND", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fabulous hotel experience!!\u201d", "Author": "Cloudreamer", "ReviewID": "UR3704105", "Content": "This is my second visit to this hotel.It was as lovely as I remembered it.

I think the location is perfect; close to downtown shopping, people watching, and a short hike to Pike's Place Market. I recommend this hotel to anyone I know who is going to the Seattle area.

The rate was competitive with other downtown hotels that were highly rated on this site, and I was unable to find a better rate on Hotwire for a hotel of the same class. The room was large with an excellent bed and a comfortable sitting area, adequate closet and drawer space, nicely decorated and appointed. The bathroom was small (no vanity) and I had some difficulty maintaining constant water temperature in the shower. There was some noise from the hallway but muffled, not loud enough to disturb the peace except doors slamming in the morning. The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful (parking valets who offered to take care of luggage if we wanted, front desk staff, and especially concierge). The location is excellent, especially close to shopping, a few blocks walk to Pike Place Market and the waterfront, about a 15-20 minute walk to Pioneer Square.

I reside here for business reasons, so the free WiFi is much appreciated. The rooms are small as American hotels go, so if you like larger rooms, go elsewhere. Even the suites (I've stayed in almost all the rooms at this point) are small. However, the warmth of the staff over the years (with little turn-over, actually) and the coziness of both the connected bar, Oliver's (one of the best Martini bars in Seattle- a MUST!!! even if you don't stay here) and Andaluca restaurant, which is pricey but tastey (free wine tastings on Wednesdays) are sometimes worth the small rooms. The hotel is conveniently located near several restaurants and many stores: Macy's (they give you discounts for this former Bon Marche at the hotel), Nordstroms, Abercrombie, Sophora, etc. The hotel is connected to Westlake Mall (another convenience), and the monorail is on the top floor that can take you to the Space Needle, park, and Experience Music. The Simpson's did a take-off on this one minute monorail, another part of Seattle life. Each room is carpeted with an armoir that contains a t.v. and drawers for whatever, no mini-bar. The beds are quite comfortable, and a.c. or heat are generally in good working order. If you're uncomfortable, go down to the desk and let them know- they will re-accomodate you. The restrooms are nice, but have limited space just above the sink on a glass railing to place personal items. Aveda products (shampoo, conditioner, soap, and body lotion) are provided as complimentary items. Showers are somewhat narrow, so it help to put the rubber mat on the floor. All closets are a very nice size with thin, cloth robes provided. Of course, very Seattle-esque, there is a Tully's on one corner and Starbucks just behind the hotel. I have read many of the reviews thus far, and I agree with all of them; however, one must remember that Seattle is the Emerald City, and people operate on a completely different level than in other parts of the country; it's part of the charm (and sometimes healthy tension). Having lived in New York, L.A., Dallas, and Houston, it was culture shock at first, but then it became delightlful and the source of good laughter. I got a good laugh from the review before mine about the guy not knowing how to make coffee- that's so Seattle. Yes, phone servce in the hotel is not the best, but Seattle people like face to face, and the responsibilities of that SMALL front desk with that many rooms and people wearing two hats is difficult.... Just relax. The lobby is GORGEOUS! A huge chandelier hanging in the front with fresh slowers put in often. The 2nd lobby floor (that connects to Westlake) contains a player piano and great sitting area fo meetings. Meeting rooms are great at his hotel, which is often the host to social events, from weddings to other celebrations. My only complaint is about the elevators: they are certainly large enough, but since the wait staff, maids, etc. use them, they often take a LONG LONG time to get to the lobby. Just go the bar, get a Martini, then catch it when you can. Make sure to visit restaurants along the Sound. The concierge (Derrick these days) is excellent, and they can get you deals that sometimes you can't- every conciege at this hotel has been both brilliant and enthusiastically helpful.", "Date": "May 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3432715", "Content": "Stayed at the Mayflower Park in Feb 2005 for a few days and had a wonderful experience.
