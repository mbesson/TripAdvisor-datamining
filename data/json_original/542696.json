I wanted to stay somewhere to get a really great feel of the island. Casa Alta Vista was perfect! We checked in Saturday and met Mark who is so personable and gave us a map tour of the island of all the places that we needed to see, great places to eat and the best beaches to visit. The room was cozy (we got the top floor one bedroom with a balcony, was the best room in my opinion :) ) Had comfortable patio furniture, a fablous view of the sky at night and a wonderful view of the ocean during the day. The room had everything we needed and was perfect. The room was clean, the water was hot and I got the best sleep I have had in years. The walk is maybe a little over a block to get to the boardwalk in espearanza. We walked to get breakfast everday morning and was a nice walk. There was never one moment that I was anywere on the island that I didnt feel safe. At the end of the 8th day, it felt like home. We woke up in the morning, went downstairs to get coffee (was the best on the island) and say hi to Mark and Sasha (his cute dog) and chat about what we did the day before and where we were off to that day. We would tell him things we came across and Mark was always able to give us more insight on the questions we had about the island. Everything was perfect. I reserached for months before settling on a place, I went back and forth between the hotel and guest house options and read review after review and finally decided on the guest house. I am so glad I did! A hotel never would have given the same feel that the guest house did, simple, cozy with no other distractions- just living life and it was great! I would like to mention, I read the reviews before I booked my trip on this site and there were people who said it was a bad thing that this property was for sale. Mark has lived on the island for 10 years and running the hotel. He is there every morning at 8 and was even there late some nights to accomidate people coming in from delays with the ferry, some even as late at 9 or 10 at night. He does a great job and yes, the property is for sale, but but never once while I was there did I ever feel that him taking care of the place and the people staying in it were not his first priority... and he does a great job at it. And after 10 years, who can blame him for wanting to take on another adventure? If I ever came back to visit the island I would stay here again, the location was great, it was clean and quiet and exactly what I hoped it would be for my perfect vacation. Thank you Mark for everything!!! It was so good to meet you and I wish you the best in whatever you do- Give Sasha a hug for us!!! --- Kevin and Lisa", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piscataway, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cWould avoid this place.\u201d", "Author": "JDK7983", "ReviewID": "UR123039608", "Content": "I wish I read the latest reviews before booking.

The room does come equipped with a mini-fridge (rust covered on the outside), an air-conditioner (cleverly plugged in with extension cords hung across the room from the cranks on the window shutters) and a TV which the owner said \"only picks up a few channels since they went digital on him (make that no channels, there is no analog broadcast anymore. We didn't mind the lack of TV, but would have appreciated the owner not trying to pretend that we might get some reception.) The owner talked up the rooftop patio, which does have an amazing view. It also has piles of trash and broken umbrellas piled around it. The rooms are OK size-wise, and several rooms have covered patio areas in front of the doors with patio furniture. But, keep in mind the windows don't have glass, so when your neighbors are enjoying their patio time they might as well be in your room with you. The noise level can get pretty high. One last issue to consider is that there are no in-room safes for valuables. The owner spontaneously told us he had never had any issues with thefts, but there are signs warning that the hotel is not responsible for anything that is stolen. It's a little hard to decide what to do, we didn't want to take everything with us to the beach, but we weren't totally comfortable leaving things in the room either. I'm not a super fancy traveler, but from talking to other travelers around town for the money you pay for Casa Alta Vista you can get similar accommodations that are more carefully maintained.

Many places would not allow us to stay for such a short time, but Casa Alta Vista accommodated us with pleasure. We were running VERY tight on time... we took a p\u00c3\u00bablico from the ferry and by the time we arrived to the hotel, we only had 15 minutes to check in, drop our bags, change clothes and get back to the front of the place for the tour bus to come pick us up. The young woman working the front desk (had dark hair just past her shoulders, I totally forget her name) was SO great to us! She understood we were running on a tight schedule so she gave us a quick run-down of things, got us checked in VERY quickly, gave us some emergency contact numbers, and helped us get up to our room. We made it to the tour bus just in time. The next day, we had to look up information on some car rental agencies for when we returned back to the main island. We also wanted to do some quick sight-seeing while we were waiting for the next ferry. She arranged our transportation back to the ferry, helped us look up information on car rentals, directed us to a great little bakery nearby, showed us how to find a hidden beach with an amazing view, and more. She chatted with us a bit and REALLY made us feel at home. I am a very inquisitive person... I always ask too many questions but she was very pleasant and more than willing to answer all of my typical tourist questions. The facilities are actually in good shape, considering the age of most of the buildings on the island. I read some of the complaints from other guests that stayed here before; honestly, I think they are just being WAY too picky. We were very happy with our accommodations. Our room was very clean, had hot water, a/c, a small fridge, cable TV and comfortable beds... not fancy but it was just perfect and worked well within our budget. I'm a little bit of a clean-freak when it comes to hotels and I felt very comfortable sleeping here, which says a lot. By the way, there ARE roosters roaming the entire island... no matter where you stay, you will hear them. However, Casa Alta Vista is far enough away from where most of the chickens hang out so the crowing was off in the distance and didn't wake us up. I was really worried about not getting enough sleep, but it was no problem. Also, Casa Alta Vista is located right down the road from the Malecon, only about a 3 - 5 minute walk. My friend and I walked down there at 10:00pm and felt very safe walking along the road. The road is very well-lit and it's literally right around the corner.

I more prefer laid back hidden gems. I have stayed and loved hostels in Spain, laid back beach resorts in West Africa, Rincon Puerto Rico and Mexico. I like off the beaten path places, so my critical review is not due to being one who prefers high end accommodations because I do not. With all that said, I thought Casa Alta Vista was overrated by its Trip Advisor reviews. I feel like the location is good, and the service is OK, but everything about the hotel is very very average. The service is OK, the people are friendly, but the continental breakfasts are coffee, muffins and warm milk and cereal. I feel like they nickle and dime you on certain things. The set up of isla vieques is one that it is difficult to bring a lot of luggage in, so people do not bring coolers, beach towels, umbrellas, etc and they charge you for this which I feel is exorbitant. Hectors By The Sea and other places include these in your room for free. The rooms are OK. The A/C in room 11 made a lot of noise if it was on for more than a few minutes so it was difficult to keep it on when you sleep. In addition, there is no staff at the hotel after 7:30 so if there is an issue, you best wait it out until morning. All this is OK if you are paying 50-60 dollars a night or are staying at a hostel, but for the rates they charge it is not good business. The owner is also not friendly. He likes to burn CDs, but not interact with his customers and see if they are enjoying their stay. Hector and Mary of Hector's by The Sea make rum drinks and give tips to their visitors. This guy never even said hello. All in all I loved my stay in Vieques. I would advise anyone to go, but I would stay at Trade Winds, Hectors By The Sea or Villa Coral before I went to Casa Alta Vista. I will probably return, but I will look to stay elsewhere.

Overall, the room was worth the price. The room we had was small but had enough room for two people (assuming you aren't spending much time in the room). The bathroom was sufficient and for the most part clean. We actually had a spectacular view of the mountains from a small window in our shower (Rm #12). The service was excellent and we found that the staff went out of their way to accomodate us (make dinner reservations, give directions, taxi pick-up's, etc.). The rooftop deck has an amazing view and is great for lounging at night and for eating a quick breakfast (for cheap and easy breakfast go to La Dulce _____ panederia - walk one block towards ocean and make first left and then first right). We also had our own patio area where where we could hang wet clothes, snokel gear, etc. (seperate patio but not secluded from view of other rooms). Esperanza main strip is only 5 min walk from hotel. A few minor down sides were tin roof (we had 3rd floor room and heavy rains were LOUD), roosters making noise quite often (yes, even in middle of night), and rental charges for everything (bikes, towels, chairs, etc.) We rented bikes for $15/day from hotel but they were in pretty poor condition. We were able to bike all the way to Blue Beach but it took an hour and was difficult since bikes were stuck in low gear. Be careful snorkeling at Red Beach. We swam out to island about 100 yds off shore only to realize that current on way in was very strong. I would not suggest doing this without fins unless you are VERY strong swimmer and even take caution with fins if you are a strong swimmer. Currents can be dangerous and ther are no warnings. Snorkeling really wasn't worth the effort. Note that if you plan to rent a car, many rental places have minimum 3 day rentals during high season. The small, basic rooms are made up for by the great location and roof top views. The convenience store downstairs is nice to grab a snack or a 6-pack of beer. I'm guessing this is one of best accomadations near Esperanza for this price range. Our favorite beach was Blue Beach and Playa Luna.

We stayed for two nights. You can draw your own conclusion as to how they beat out the Ritz Carlton, Sheraton, Water Club Hotel, Intercontinental and many other world class hotels to be ranked #2 in Puerto Rico. - We were given a can of mosquito spray to kill the mosquitos INSIDE our room. My wife woke up with 5-10 mosquito bites in the morning and we both got to enhale dioxin fumes from the spray all night. - Our room, #1, is a basement room as in the feeling of a damp cellar. The patio elegantly described in other postings is enclosed by cinder blocks, a bathroom that non-hotel guests use and the janitorial closet. The far side of the gorgeous patio has all of the scooters and bikes available for rental. - The security chain on our door was broken and was not replaced. The normal door lock was broken and would only lock when slammed repeatedly until catching as advised by the staff. There is no safe and they are not responsible for theft. - The air conditioner sounds like an unmodified Cessna 172. Turn it off to sleep and it feels like the suana at the Sheraton. - The TV gets NO english channels. One channel comes in clear and all the remaining four channels are covered in snow. - All of the bedspreads are stained with we only can image what when you look at the reverse side, ewe. Every bathroom towel had stains on them, ewe. - Another posting is correct that the dog doesn't bark next door. They stand across the street to howl instead. It is perfect because there is no alarm clock or phone so you can rely on the dogs to wake you up in the morning. - I can't criticize the hotel for the kids running back and forth in the room above us. What I do agree with is that the hotel is conceivably quieter than staying on the main drag two blocks away. However, since you need to rent a car to get around, I would highly recommend staying at much nicer and far less tourist rip off places on the other side of the island (5 minutes away) and commuting the five minutes to this side to take a look. There is more than ample parking, or heck, take a horse that you find tied up ever 100 ft or so. We did find out from the locals that no one even eats at the restaurants on this side of the island because they are for the tourists. I did enjoy the food at Tradewinds. Otherwise, there are some great road side stands and better restaurants on the other side of the island. Oh, a quick tip if you do stay here. If you lean cross way in front of the tv with the door open and hold your foot on the garbage can, you can get one bar on your cell phone to get a call as reflected from the cinder block patio. Another tip. Island Rental car has the best rental car rates ($60 rather than $85 at other places) and gave us great service. They don't have hotel pickup but the cab ride is only $3/person to get your car. Everything is only five minutes from whereever you are. If you do the awesome bio-bay trip at night, bring your own waterproof flashlight (it is sooo dark) and mosquito spray.

The room had two full beds, television; small, two-drawer nightstand; refrigerator, fan, A/C, and private bathroom. The shower curtain was torn and moldy, but I didn't care much. The room was clean when we checked in and the housekeeping staff maintained it every day while we were out exploring the island, which was a major plus since we trekked in a lot of sand. I have friends on the island that showed us around, but I witnessed firsthand how accommodating the staff and owner, Mark, were for other tourists who asked for help and advice. The convenience store was a great asset for snacks, drinks, and even snorkel gear rentals (among other things). The public rooftop area had plenty of chairs and a grill, and offered a great view of the surrounding area, mountains, and ocean. We didn't have any problem with barking dogs waking us up at night. There was a dog next door, but he didn't make much noise during the night. We didn't hear any chickens. The noisiest things were the A/C (you can set the fan to a lower speed when sleeping) and the rain hitting the metal A/C unit from the outside (which is beyond Casa Alta Vista's control). Casa Alta Vista is on the main road that leads to the popular tourist and local strip called Malecon. However, it's far enough down the road (1-2 minute walk) where it's quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of the restaurants, but close enough to still be convenient. (Tip: Try not to eat most meals at restaurants that line the Malecon strip--food is very expensive. Buy breakfast and lunch from little bakeries and road-side stands. They may seem shady, but the food is tasty and very cheap.) The beach is just across the street, but it's mostly a boat harbor. Sun Bay is farther down the road, perhaps a five minute walk. I would highly recommend renting a Jeep and going out to Navio Bay (between Sun Bay and Bio Bay) because it's less crowded and the sand and water are pristine. Our local friends took us to many beaches, but we always returned to Navio at the end of each day. (Tip: If there are spotty showers in the forecast, don't run away. Just stay at the beach and the rain may pass in five minutes. What's a few little rain drops if you'll be swimming in an ocean anyway?) To summarize, you may be taken aback at it's \"homely\" appearance, but you should never expect a high-end resort on the island without paying a couple hundred dollars a night.

I could have passed on the harmonica playing and singing country songs that Tim did though. Tim is a little bit of a character, a self proclaimed hick from somewhere in middle America I should say, and has some racist comments here and there which were a bit offensive.

We signed up for their Eco Tour package and did a biobay trip, all day cruise to the Bermuda Triangle, all day kayaking, and horse back riding. In the end, we did not do horseback riding, and they agreed to throw in two more biobay trips for my inlaws instead of \"losing\" out on an opportunity. Lucy and the cleaning staff were great. We always had fresh towels, and the beds were made and sheets changed. One day, we had left out some dirty shorts and tshirts from the previous day, and they folded them!! My favorite story was on Valentine's day. My wife and I went on our Day Cruise with Captain Bill (that CAV set up for us) and when we returned we had a heart shaped out of three towels on our bed along with two complimentary drinks from the shop downstairs and a whole bunch of Hershey's kisses. There was also a handwritten note from the staff. The staff was fantastic. Orlando is the man. He knows all and is genuinely excited and interested in how you are doing. Mark (the owner) is also very genuine and I witnessed and experienced this interest and concern many times over the 7 days that we were there. They always had an answer when we had a question or were looking for suggestions. I can't speak highly enough about how great this place was. They took care of our every need, regardless of how trivial it may have seemed (extra maps for our inlaws to record their travels). I have very few complaints, and most of them are really outside of the hotel's control. 1. Road traffic...Flamboyan St. is the major entrance into Esperanza from the west side of the island. And the locals drive, shall I say, \"enthusiastically\". This obviously creates a lot of road noise. 2. Dogs. Or should I say, Dog. The dog next door would bark at anything or anyone if he was left out at night. Fortunately, this only happend two of the six nights we were there, and we had the A/C on the second night so it was much less annoying. 3. Bed was tired. Mark really needs to address the mattress issue soon. 4. I speak a little spanish, but I rely on the people I'm talking me to make sure the conversation has the desired effect. They have one attendant (I called \"Il Muto\") that only stood and stared at you when you talked. He needs to be trained again. Overall though, this place is fantastic.

We knew ahead of time that Vieques was one of those islands where we weren't going to be imprisoned within the compound of a 4 star luxury hotel. We knew that the charm of Vieques was the guest houses and rubbing elbows with the locals. There were many guest houses to choose from and we chose Casa Alta Vista because it was rated among the best. As it turned out it was everything we expected, only better. Here is my top 3 reasons why we loved it. 1.) ADVENTURE PACKAGE: Buying into the 7 Day Ultimate Adventure was the best idea ever!! I've talked to people who have been to Vieques 6 times and never did the things we did or saw the things we saw with this package. Ricky and Mark set us up on Karl's mountain bike nature ride (which was awesome), we went horseback riding, snorkelling, sailing to the bermuda triangle, and they set us up with a car (which was there waiting for us) and drinks for the whole week, and a boogie board for the waves at Navio AND it includes the price of the stay. We did all this cool stuff and still had plenty of time to bum around. This Adventure package saved us from having to spend time figuring it all out on our own only to realize later that we missed something. We feel like we got the most out of our time in Vieques. 2.) STAFF: Ricky and Mark are the best. They are so knowledgable and have such a passion for the island. They really take you under their wing and save you from having to figure out the island on your own. Thanks Ricky for bringing in Fresh bread from the bakery every day and plucking Mangos and Anone from the trees on your way in. Thanks also to the cleaning ladies who told us about the paintings and jewlery at Luna Loca NOTE: When you stay there make sure Ricky brings you to the neighbor who makes Flan and the other neighbor who makes the frozen fruit cups for 25 cents. 3.) LOCATION: CAV is close enough to the Malecon (Boardwalk) of Esperanza to give easy access but not so close that you wake in the night to band playing on Friday night, radios and people walking by. The best shell hunting is right down the hill in front of you AND you have easy access to great restaurants like Trade Winds, Belly Buttons and the ultimate sunset at Blue Horizon. Thx again Ricky and Mark for helping to make our Honeymoon in Vieques the best.", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beautiful Texas", "Title": "\u201cJust as perfect as described.....\u201d", "Author": "Big_Blake", "ReviewID": "UR5494338", "Content": "Arrived July 14- checked into Room 3 with wife and two boys aged 5 and 8. What can you say about these folks? They go out of their way to ensure you can find nothing to complain about! CAV (especially Mark and Ricky) operates under the premise that satisfying every need you have will create die-hard loyal customers that will do nothing but spread good news about CAV - and book a return visit ASAP! A few random and loosely constructed thoughts about our stay..... They took possession of my rented Jeep from Martiza Car Rentals for me when I arrived- so our car was waiting for us at the hotel. Orlando checked us in - gave us a map of Vieques, showed us routes to all beaches, restaurants, sites, and took probably a total of 20 minutes to make sure we were well-oriented with the island. Room 3 was air-conditioned, clean and exactly as described in previous posts - simple but great. Whenever you need restaurant advice- they will be happy to oblige - got great restaurant tips from all members of the staff. Was never disappointed by a recommendation - Tradewinds restaurant, Bananas restaurant, Topacio restaurant, Taverna Espanola restaurant, Island Adventures bio-bay tour, La Dulce Esperanza panaderia and the colmado next door for all breakfast needs, etc... were all winners- they kept in mind we had kids and made recommendations accordingly. I recommend the beach bum package - two chairs, a cooler, an umbrella, and ice every day. It's like $15 a day and worth every penny. The small grocery in the office is super-convenient.... got our beach-drinks each morning, ice cream bars every night for the kids, and Medalla Lights every night for adult roof-top consumption. Tip for folks with kiddos - get some inexpensive walkie-talkies... you can set the kids up for bed-time with their portable DVDs or whatever and you can head up to the roof. When our kids needed something, they would contact us on the walkie-talkies, and we were only a 30 second walk away, but we still had a chance for a little non-kid relaxing..... Highly recommend the roof-top - think of the best and clearest night sky you have ever seen, then multiply the number of stars by 100, and there you have it. Views are great during the day as well. After day 3 of sharing a bed and having no personal space, our boys were kind of going nuts and they needed some space before their mom and I went nuts. I went down to the front desk, a little embarrased, and explained the situation- and Mark recommended we move to a larger two-bedroom unit - Room 6. Told us to go to the beach and when we returned, Room 6 was waiting for us. It is a unit that Mark has not gotten around to remodeling yet- but was excellent for our needs. Had a nice balcony off the front of the building. Housekeeping staff was a pair of the sweetest ladies you will ever meet. They do a great job, always greet you with a smile, and always ask if there is anything you need. Absolutely LOVED these gals. Weekend crowd was mainly folks coming over from the Big Island, and weekday guests were primarily stateside gringos. Mangos grow on a tree directly east of the building - grab some. I can honestly say this is the first time in all our travels (we take 2-3 big trips a year, and try to never go to the same place twice) that my wife has ever DEMANDED that we not only return to Vieques, but also to CAV. A good product and great folks..... A few other toughts about the trip- was only hassled once by a vendor the entire trip - and it was a young gringo male who was trying to tell us what a huge mistake we were making by going with Island Adventures instead of the kayak trip to the biobay where he worked..... all beaches east of the Sun Bay beaches on the south side (Red, Blue, Garcia, Secret) are ridiculously nice and ridiculously empty. Beaches accessible from Sun Bay like Navio and Media Luna were a little crowded, but still emptier than any beach you could find in Florida.... you can collect tons of seaglass at the beach just across Hwy. 200 from the Old Ceiba Tree - wife and two kids probably picked up 300-400 pieces in less than an hour.......take the time to get to know the history of Vieques before going - it made a lot of what you see on the island more understandable - buy the book \"Vieques\" by Gerald Singer - it's available on Amazon....... there's always a breeze - the weather in Vieques is textbook definition of \"nice weather\".........", "Date": "July 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cThe People Made it Perfect\u201d", "Author": "DCFrequentFlyer35", "ReviewID": "UR5423153", "Content": "Casa Alta Vista is a budget travellers dream--clean rooms with all the necessities, excellent prices, excellent location, and even a fantastic roofdeckt!

There is a history to it and I will leave it at that. This hotel was fantastic considering you pay less than $65 a night (we stayed for 5 or 6 days and it cost less than one night on the main island Puerto Rico) and the fact of the matter is, you aren't there for most of the day anyway. The people all feel like family and treat you that way as well. Mark and his crew are absolutely fantastic. When we had trouble finding a rental car because it was so busy the time we went, Orlando hopped on the phone and called every car rental place finally finding us a great little place with awesome deals. There is so much to do and see on this one little island that we actually wished we hadn't gone to Puerto Rico in the first place and just stayed here the entire 11 days we were down there. There isn't much to the hotel. You get a cozy room with a bed, dresser, refrigerator and a nice bathroom. A/C worked great!! But honestly, you don't need a TV or anything like that when you are here. Walking along the beach at night and searching for shells, exploring all the paths to the hidden beaches and walking up the mountain is great fun. We got so burned while we were there because we were outside in the sun so much. Mark has great little aloe plants that he suggests you cut some off, stick them in the freezer and they do wonders when you can't sleep at night. As soon as you check in, whoever is checking you in, will get out their map and show you all the places that you can go to. If you have any questions about the island, its history and what might happen in the future they know what went on and what is going on. They are great!!! You wouldn't get this kind of service anywhere else. They love what they do and you will see it when you meet them and talk to them. One other thing, the Bio-bay tour is absolutely fantastic. We almost didn't go because it's $30 a person ... but it was well worth it. It is amazing you will never see anything like it in your life --- honestly, you should do it if you have never done it before. Seriously, this is the place that you'll want to come. It's just far enough from the hustle and bustle of little Esperanza but within walking distance of EVERYTHING. However, to explore the island in great detail I suggest you book yourself a jeep rental. They are great for the off-roading and you'll get farther than you would on foot.

We had reservations for all of us in room #7 for 1 night and then 2 people in the group moved into room #3 for the remaining 3 nights. The Casa Alta Vista has absolutely the best customer service of any hotel I have ever stayed at. The rave reviews you read about Casa Alta Vista service from previous customers are true! First the basics - Casa Alta Vista is located on the main street closed to the water. It is a 5 minute (at most) walk to the restaurants and bars. One has to walk on the side of the road and at times the cars come at you quickly. The speed limit on the island is 35 mph. The short walk on the road is one of the few negatives about Casa Alta Vista. Room #7 has 2 bedrooms. One room has would a king(queen?) bed and the second bedroom has a bunk bed. The lower is a double and upper is a twin. The matresses were good on every bed. A third room has a small apartment size fridge and freezer. We found ourselves sitting out on the semi-private patio if we were at the hotel. Most of the rooms have a semi-private patio. Room #12 definitely has the best patio...it has more space and a hammock. Room #7 could sleep 5-6 adults in a pinch. We opted for a second room because we wanted additional space since we were staying for 4 days. Mark, the owner, brought up a mattress for us to lay on the floor for the first night. Room #3 was below room #7. It has 2 beds and had a traditional hotel room setup. It didn't have the view though from the patio. Inside it was nicer though. The rooms are pretty basic. Functional. The area is more residential than the other hotels. You don't have the loud bar crowd noise or the stereo car noise from cruising cars. We did have some construction noise in the morning from next door. I will even miss the roosters that announced each approching dawn. Ahhhh...but the customer service. From the moment I checked in to the moment I left it felt like the staff was there to help all of us have a good time. Here are some examples of their service: I noticed my rental car had a flat tire moments before we were to take off for a chartered snorkeling tour. The staff immediately called the rental company for me, I explained the situation to the rental company and the rental company (Martineau) came out and fixed the tire before I got back at noon. I already mentioned the extra mattress the first night. They gave us great recommendations for a restaurant in Isabel (Topacia) and a biobay tour (Caribe). The staff runs a convenience store on the first floor and runs a tab for you. After the first day all I had to do was have them acknowledge me and my purchase as I walked out the door. I just settled up at the end. The staff pointed out the best snorkeling spots on a map for us. The staff was very good at taking time to answer your questions...probably the same questions they answer many times each day. It seemed like the staff enjoyed the customer interfacing aspect of their job and because of that I didn't feel like I was imposing on them by asking questions. The housekeeping staff was also fun to interact with.

Each room had a bathroom, which was important given that there were 6 of us. The rooms were clean, the beds were reasonably comfortable, and the a/c worked very well. In addition, as other reviewers have noted, both the owner Mark and the manager Ricky were very hospitable, and helped us with tips about where to eat, what beaches had the best snorkeling, where to go fishing, etc. Ricky in particular charmed all four of the teenagers, who were delighted when he turned out also to be the guide on our Bio-Bay Trip.

We planned on doing the same again but were warned not to since we now have 7 and 10 year old daughters and the place can become loud later into the night. Bananas actually gave us Casa Alta Vistas name. We stayed in San Juan from Feb 19 to Feb 22 at an expensive resort,(really not worth it), then hopped in the rental and drove to Farjado to take the cargo ferry to Vieques. Be advised that rentals from the main island are not supposed to go to Vieques. We were the only car amongst big dump trucks and and other trucks making deliveries to Vieques. It was actually kind of funny. Upon arriving at Casa Alta Vista we were greeted by ricky, the hotel manager and Mark the owner. If anyone can make you feel like you're at home these two gentlemen can. Well informed about anything related to the island and eagerly willing to spend the time to explain it. My kids loved Ricky. The room we stayed in was #7 of the 12 in the hotel. It was perfectly adequate with fridge, a/c and most important to the kids, bunk beds. The roof deck provides a great place to have a sunset cocktail or to stare at the stars in complete blackness. They have a great little store downstairs and they let you run a handwritten tab throughout your visit. If you like cozy and inexpensive this is the place. It sounds like the guys have some great ideas for the place in the future. Cant wait to go back and see the results Thanks guys. ps- If you go on the bio bay tour, which I highly recommend, ricky also drives the bus and conducts the tour.", "Date": "March 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middle Island, Long Island, New York", "Title": "\u201cIf there is nowhere else to stay...\u201d", "Author": "sambuca", "ReviewID": "UR4471248", "Content": "We were staying at Casa De Amistad in Vieques. We loved Vieques so much we had to stay another day, unfortunately our place was booked, so we started searching, it seemed everyone was booked. Then we contacted Casa Alta Vista. They had just gotten a cancellation so we jumped on it. Ricky at the desk was super sweet and helpful. The room was pretty gross. The top cover had mildew stains and other unidentifiable stains. The air conditioning worked really well. The bathroom was dirty in the corners, and ALL of the towels had stains,and were hard and scratchy. We were next to the laundry room, so I went in and took more sheets so we didn't have to use the top cover. I didn't even take my shirt off in bed cause I was so grossed out. We were grateful to find a place to lay our head, but I would never plan on vacationing here.Ricky was so sweet he even gave us a discount because our room was for a family and we were only 2, so he took $20 bucks off.

What an awesome hotel and staff! We were there from February 4-8. Both Ricky and Mark went out of their way to meet our every need. Upon our arrival, Ricky took the time to go over the map of Vieques with us and show us all the best places to check out. We rented a scooter from the hotel which ran great but it was rough on our booty's on the gravelly beach roads so we asked if we could switch to a car and they magically hooked us up with a vehicle. We also stayed in Room #12 which has the best view. The shower was always hot and the room always clean. We felt comfortable leaving our valuables in the room as the housekeeping staff was very trustworthy. In general, we felt very safe there and on the rest of the island. The convenience store was a godsend! My man needed a pair of water shoes for snorkeling and they even had some in his size there! There were snacks, staples and a variety of beverages for sale and always free coffee in the morning for guests. These guys are running a top-notch establishment that deserves all the rave reviews it gets! Thanks so much Ricky and Mark, you made our stay in Vieques extra memorable and we'll definitely be back! We also did the all day Kayaking tour with Abe. We were his only clients that day and he gave us the best tour ever! He is so knowledgeable and tells you all the little details about the mangrove canals (which we actually kayaked through!) and biobay; I learned so much. We went to a private beach and snorkeled, ate dinner provided by Abe which was very good (from Bili - highly recommended) and then headed back to the biobay at nightfall to check out the most amazing, illuminating spectacle, the microorganisms really do glow! Abe is so personable and a great tour guide. I highly recommend his tour, he has a great staff which now includes his son who's just as knowledgeable!

We arrived Vieques by plane and paid $5 each for the publico that was waiting outside the door. It's true that they wait for more passengers, and it looked like the other couple was getting impatient. However, as soon our luggage arrived, we loaded up and headed to other side of the island with just four of us. Ricky was the best!! Friendly and personable, he gave us a warm greeting and the tour. He spent a generous amount of time telling us about Vieques. Since we did not have a rental car, he provided a great map and pointed out places on and off the malecon to dine and drink (try the roadside vendors!) as well as a few beaches that we could walk to. He called to confirm our bio bay tour and when we realized we left our camera in the publico, he called the driver for us. We knew he was looking out for us, so we didn't wait for the publico to return before heading out to explore Ricky's suggstions. Thanks, again Ricky! The hotel is an easy walk to the malecon and the neighborhood is charming. We passed yards full of chickens and one evening, a group of boys street boxing. Yes, you'll hear dogs barking and wake to roosters crowing. It's wonderful! The convenience store is just that! We grabbed water for the room and a six pack to take to dinner at the Tiki Hut on the malecon. We stayed in Room 12 with it's yellow door and yellow walls. It's not the only one with outdoor seating, but it's nicely situated on the end with the hammock. The room was basic and clean. I don't recall the hot water situation, but we only used it to rinse off and wash out our suits and sandals. The roof top deck was the perfect way to happily end the day! Originally, I booked with Hector's by the Sea, but because we were on a budget and wanted to stay at Casa Flamboyant on the mainland, I changed CAV for it's great tripadvisor reviews. I didn't go wrong!

Vieques found its way to the top of my Caribbean vacation spots, and I couldn't imagine ever staying anyplace but Casa Alta Vista when I go back. I am one of the Bostonians Mark took to go get a rental car mentioned in a previous review...but let us start at the beginning. Mark said he would hook us up, as we didn't know anything about the island before we arrived. And that he did. Took us on a tour of all the beaches and a little history of the isalnd at that. Showed us how to get home from the beach (Medea Luna cannot be beat) Next day we wanted a jeep, so he loaded us into his and drove us over to the rental company where we got a sweet 4Runner for short cash. Mark also set us up with charge account at the little store he runs downstairs, where we got beer for the beach, ice rum and etc. for the room, as well as snacks. Highlight - Mark also went across the street and picked us a few limes right off the tree when we got our rum and coke, then let us borrow a knife from his own pad to make sure we could appreciate some cocktails on the roof at sunset. As for the place itself...it is a nice building, good beds, clean and convenient to town - just a couple minutes walk. I couldn't have been more happy with the place...I was just sad to have to leave. So Mark, thanks and good luck and you will definitely see me next time I am down that way!", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Albany, NY", "Title": "\u201ca great place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4328256", "Content": "My wife and I and our two college-student sons spent four nights at Casa Alta Vista around Xmas.

[He even steered us to a great restaurant in San Juan (Miro).]The rooms were simple, colorful, clean, and comfortable, with a great deck on the roof. It's only a short walk to the low-key tourist strip on the beach and a bakery around the corner. Mark has been there only a few years, so the place is a bit of a work in progress and will only get better. He is very interested in all feedback, and made us feel like part of his project, and indeed, his family. We rented a car from Martineau Bay Car Rental near the airport, and that worked out great. Several guests asked to meet with realtors, so we can only hope that Vieques will control its development so it stays as wonderful and low-key as it is now.

A few other recommendations: 1 - Ricky will set you up with Julian's car service to get from San Juan to Fajardo. We paid $60 and Jul\u00c3\u00adan's son, Juvian was a great escort for our drive. 2 - If you feel comfortable, rent a scooter with them.
