The hotel is upscale and modern, yet, understated in a traditional sense. The staff is attentive and pleasant but, not obtrusive. The room was incredibly comfortable and housekeeping came twice per day. I had an amazing 80 minute hot stone massage at the spa. Sherri was very experienced and customized the massage to accommodate my requests. Another great feature was the salt water lap pool which was extremely relaxing. I am not a swimmer; yet, for some reason I was compelled to swim laps at Hotel Georgia. The therapeutic lights in the pool was a new experience for me and something I really enjoyed. I think light therapy really works! Another memorable moment was when I arrived one evening with a bottle of wine, cheese and a loaf of French bread to take up to my room. The concierge assessed my fare and kindly asked if I would like a plate and knife to enjoy my \"dinner\". Room service arrived less that 3 minutes later at my door with a sharp knife, plate and napkin.

Ok, so the room wasnt massive, but it was more than big enough for a business traveller. The hotel lobby bar did nice food, well presented, quickly delivered by friendly staff and was a decent price. The one time I did make breakfast I found it a little expensive. I suppose I'm more used to the buffet style. Maybe next time I'll avoid the fresh OJ.

My wife kept saying that we wouldn't be spending any time in the room anyways..... The room overlooked the interior courtyard and on the second night a band was playing in the court yard. I phoned and complained about the noise and was told that the band would only be playing to 11:00 pm or so. . I said that my expectation was that when I rented a room, I expected it to be quiet. Further more that they knew that I was staying for five nights and that if they had a band going for a event, they should not have booked the rooms overlooking the court yard. There was no apology. Simply a reiteration that the band would shut down around 11:00 pm. I insisted on another room demanded to speak to the night manager. Got a phone call back about 15 minute later (9:30 pm or so) and more talk about the band shutting down. I got pretty angry and hung the phone. Phoned the Sutton Place (2 blocks away) and they had a room. Then I got another phone from the front desk of the Rosewood saying they would be giving me a 'complimentary upgrade'. Talk about arrogance! They were the ones that booked me into a room that they should never had let given that they had a band going. Said thanks but no thanks and that I would be downstair in five minutes to pay my bill. Which I did. My wife and I then caught cab over to the Sutton Place. Sutton Place was great.

A few blocks more Gas town's great restaurants. Speaking of restaurants the hotel restaurant \"Hawksworth\" is fantastic. We had breakfast & light dinner, both wonderful. Great wine list. Additionally \"Reflections Lounge\" an open air area is a great spot to sip a glass of wine outside by the fire in the crisp Vancouver evening. The pool, exercise and spa areas are also exceptional. Lovely facilities and super staff. Speaking of staff be sure to meet Jim. He drove us (in his Bentley) to catch the sunset at English Bay(recommended by the concierge (i am sorry I forgot your name).

We have stayed at Rosewood resorts before and always had an amazing experience. This was no different. The room was amazing, with modern amenities including a nespresso machine (my husband loved this and used it every day) and convenient buttons on the wall to control lighting, including one right next to the bed to turn on the \"privacy\" sign, which was extremely convenient! I hate it when I get in bed then realize I forgot to put the privacy sign out on the door... The best part of the room is the bathroom. The floors are heated, the whole bathroom is covered with beautiful dark brown marble and the shower is amazing. It's huge and has 4 rain shower heads. The bathroom itself is also quite large and takes up about 1/3rd of the room or more. The only complaint I have about the room is that the closet is teeny and there's no way to stow your suitcases or unpack all of your clothes. I don't think this would be as big of a deal in the summer but when we went it was really cold so we had a lot of bulky clothes. Also there was some street noise that made it a little difficult to sleep some nights. We could have used a sound machine but it didn't bother us so much that we went out of our way to find some way to block the noise. The hotel is conveniently located and was an easy downhill 10 minute walk to the convention center every morning. It is also in easy walking distance of many great restaurants. As far as the hotel staff, they could not have been more friendly or helpful. Every concierge we talked to there gave us the best recommendations and was extremely helpful. Same for the front desk and staff at the hotel restaurant, which we went to for drinks and dessert. Drinks were good, dessert was OK. But like I said, best service ever. I couldn't have asked for anything more. We also sampled the spa. I got a relaxation massage and the cocoon treatment, both of which were heavenly. I also got a manicure and pedicure. My husband got a deep tissue massage that he wasn't too impressed with. He also got the shower tapas as well as the scalp tapas, both of which he really enjoyed. Again the staff was very professional, did a great job and really went the extra mile to make you feel relaxed. The spa itself was absolutely beautiful, with a great cozy relaxation room and really beautiful facilities. We didn't bring our swimsuits but wish we had after we saw the pool. It, too, was really beautiful with large dark brown marble pillars and a beautiful tile deck. The bottom of the pool has large panels of lights that slowly change colors. We did go to the gym, which has all state of the art equipment and a small room for doing non-machine related exercises, as well as a set of free weights. The gym is also really aesthetically pleasing and is surrounded by large floor to ceiling windows so you can watch the city below. The staff keeps the gym sparkly clean, coming in every 20 minutes or so to tidy up. They keep cool water and cool towels readily available. Some of the cardio machines even have games on them that you can play while you work out, which I thought was a pretty neat feature. I really enjoyed working out in it and wish I had been able to use it more. Overall a great experience.

While in Vancouver, I recommend: taking the Canada Line from the airport to the stop one block from the Hotel Georgia (buy a day pass from the 7-Eleven in the airport), renting bikes (Bayshore Bikes) for a 5+ mile, mostly level, ride around the perimeter of Stanley Park and along the sea wall, touring by seaplane with Harbour Air (we booked the Panorama Experience at the terminal which is near Canada Place), grazing on cheese and fruit at the Granville Public Market (take a mini-ferry for $3.50 one-way), schlepping out to the Museum of Anthropology ($30 taxi or easy bus ride), and shopping Alberni Street.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nanaimo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "Jill S", "ReviewID": "UR126306821", "Content": "We just returned from a stay at the Hotel Georgia. The atmosphere of the lobby and rooms was great. We were on the 11th floor and no complaint about noise from the street.

I didn't have any where to hang my bathroom bag, or towels after we had used them. Also the heated floor was almost too hot, and you have to lie on the floor to adjust the temperature which is located under the bathroom counter. I know these seem like small things but at a hotel of this caliber you would expect attention to small details. The location is incredibly convenient and the customer service was super.

The decor is amazing with wood paneling almost everywhere but tastefully done. I couldnt fine a single flaw with the craftsmanship. Excellent carpenters. Room: A bit small but Im not complaining. Also wood paneling everywhere. Craftsmanship is excellent. Our room was at the end of the hall but still a short walk to the elevator. I never knew how much i would appreciate heated bathroom floors and ceiling rain showers until now. There isnt space for a DVD player but if you ask the concierge the engineer will gladly set one up for you. This helped when we utilized the DVD library for our daughter. Beds were comfortable as any hotel. We were on the 8th floor and couldnt hear any traffic from the street below. Location: Central and a short walking distance to almost anything. Across the street is Four Seasons and the mall and a block away is the Fairmont where we had afternoon tea. The convention center is less than 10 minute walk. London Drugs also a block away as well as Robson St. for shopping. Hawksworth Restaurant: Food was excellent but they seem to cater to the businees clientale more than families. We ate there twice but the next 3 days we ate at the Four Seasons Yew restaurant. Yew seemed to cater to our daughter and family more and the service of Four Seasons is seen in the restaurant. Fitness: Average size and there wasnt more than 3 other people whnever I was there. Pool is nice with changing lights. Jim the driver was excellent and our daughter loved him. Connie the concierge also excellent but they really all are excellent.

Some of things I liked: 1. HVAC. Many restaurants and hotels have the H and the AC but stumble on the Ventilation. A place with inadequate ventilation gets stuffy. Your ventilation system, as well as temperature control, worked great. 2. Rain shower - this was great. 3. Heated tile in the bathroom floor - wonderful! 4. Marble in the bathroom - counter, floor and shower areas. This was amazing - it had the rich texture of a fine marble but was not cold to the touch, was not slippery in the shower and in fact felt soft on the feet. 5. Flashlight in the closet for emergencies is a great idea and I've never seen this before in a hotel. 6. Closet areas were small but so well arranged with drawers and hanging space that I had plenty of room. 7. Expresso machine was great and got used a lot! 8. TV on the wall saves space. 9. Bed and bedclothes were very comfortable. I liked the idea of the gooseneck reading lamps on the headboard, although mine were not functional (or I couldn't find the switches). 10. I liked the hidden electrical outlets in the desk and nightstand. Very neat and practical in that I always have a bunch of chargers to plug in and many hotels don't seem to have enough outlets. 11. Staff - super nice and outgoing but not overbearing. Everyone would say \"Hello\" as they passed in the halls. David, who checked me in during the evening shift, was particularly helpful after my credit card was blocked and we had to reverse some things the next night after I got it cleared. 12. Not that anything is far in downtown Vancouver, but the location of the Rosewood was across the street from most of my business meetings. 13. Although I did not have dinner at the Hawksworth restaurant, several people told me it is among the best in town. I did have breakfast there and it was great. 14. I did use the Internet in the room. There is a two-tiered system and you can choose the higher priced one if you have more than one device for internet access. I had my laptop and iPhone but you could connect just the laptop in the room and use the free WiFi in the lobby to update emails on the iPhone every now and then.

If you have read other reviews that I have written, you will know that I set a very high bar for service, quality and glamour if a hotel bills itself as a 4 or 5 star. The Rosewood did not disappoint -- if anything it far exceeded my expectations and has raised my bar for what is truly required in a hotel. Well done Rosewood! The Good: - The front desk staff were consummate professionals -- accommodating, friendly without being intrusive, incredibly knowledgeable, well-spoken and exuded class. I had the privilege of being served upon check-in by Cash. What a great individual and a true credit to the hotel. - Before I could even turn around from the front desk, there was a hotel staffer in a very nice suit who was there to put my bags on the cart and escort me to my room. He was just a friendly guy, again uber professional and a credit to the hotel. Upon arrival in my room, he asked if I needed anything and I said yes, that I would like some cigarettes (it's a nasty habit I have picked up whilst travelling... but I digress) and would he know where there was a store close by that I could pick some up at. He then informed me that part of the hotels service was to run errands for their guests. I gave him the money, he got my cigarettes for me -- all in about 10 minutes. Unreal. I was so impressed. - The rooms. Oh my gosh, the rooms. Beautiful BEAUTIFUL furnishings, a welcoming bed, a beautiful headboard, couches that looked like they were just bought, amazing armchairs, a desk that was high quality with not a scuff mark to be seen. The wardrobes lining the entry hallway were absolutely out of this world, ample room, quality hangers, an impressively stocked mini bar. - The service from the staff again was incredible - I needed my shoes polished and my suit pressed for a dinner I was attending. I called at 11pm. They picked up both and I had them back by 7am the next morning. Beautiful. - The food. Incredible. If you haven't been to Hawkesworth you simply must go. A fantastic experience in excellent food, beautiful wines and a classy atmosphere with - again - amazing staff. - The lounge just off the lobby is very \"old money\" and is absolutely a treat to be in. I can't say enough about it. It just makes you feel a cut above the rest. - The lobby, like the rest of the hotel, is absolutely stunning with well-appointed decor, attentive staff and exudes the 5-star experience that guests can/should expect from a hotel that bills itself as high quality. It is. In every respect. - The doormen. Again, unreal. From offering you water when you get in to a car, to calling your car service, to going out in the rain to flag down your car while you wait in the comfort of the lobby, these guys are second to none.

Even in the Bel Cafe, the server took the time to introduce himself and remembered me the next time I came in - and all I had was a cappuccino! The hotel room was sumptuous and extremely comfortable.

Our bed had a pillow top mattress, something about which I am usually dubious as I find them too soft but as it was I slept very well. The pillows were perfect and not too soft. The hotel also honoured our request for the bed to be made up with a regular blanket and sheets (and not a duvet). The windows of the room could be opened and therefore we didn't need to keep the a/c on while sleeping to keep the room at a comforable (cooler) temperature for sleeping. We had pre-dinner drinks at 1927 and the barman was knowledgable and capable and mixed my martini exactly as I like it. We dined at Hawksworth restaurant and had a meal of brilliant quality with fresh local produce showcased perfectly - David Hawksworth's food is intelligent but not fussy and focuses on the quality of the produce and its flavour. It was easy to have three courses with wine and not feel over-full. Everything was delicious but a particular highlight was the short ribs first course. Beef short ribs cooked sous vide for 48 hours produced strongly flavoured and meltingly tender meat and the seasonings were Thai-inspired but without any sweet notes which worked perfectly with the rich meat. We paired this with the sweetbreads and this was the right combination as the glaze on the sweetbreads was quite sweet but was a perfect balance against the sour/salty/hot of the short ribs.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in downtown Vancouver!\u201d", "Author": "auroranyc1", "ReviewID": "UR123412850", "Content": "I'll try to keep my review short and sweet. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a week for our birthdays. As you may know, the Rosewood hotels email you a guest preference form to book special services; e.g Spa services, dinner reservations, reason for your stay/if you are celebrating any event.. etc. I had mentioned we will be visiting for our birthdays but didn't specify anything more or less. When we arrived we were greeted by Brian which was so nice (also helpful during our entire stay). Connie at the reception desk, wished us \"Happy Birthday\" and we thought it was such a nice gesture! Later on that day, we received a birthday cake with a card from the manager - which they didn't have too - but to go that extra step, what a great way to treat your guests. Also our last night in town, we had booked a reservation at the hotels' restaurant \"Hawksworth\" which again on our deserts, they wrote \"happy birthday\" on them once more. Very nice touch! Rooms: We stayed in room 911 - which gives a view of the Pacific Centre. Spacious room, comfortable bed and pillows, loved the heated bathroom floors! Nice size shower - all around great room for your getaway. Hotel staff: I don't know and remember everyone name but trust me when I say: everyone on staff is so cordial and nice - and go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect! Everyone knew us by name by the first day. The staff is all so pleasant and sweet! Matthew the concierge was helpful when planning our day trip to Whistler. The hotel offers complimentary Bentley car service, to drive you around in the downtown area and Jim (the driver) was great to us as well. He gave us a mini tour of Gastown and surroundings areas which was great! Last but not least, we asked Celina who works at the bar if she recommends a good restaurant, she said she didn't remember the name of a particular restaurant, so she told us she would text her boyfriend and get back to us. Long story short: when we got back from dinner that night, we found an envelope at our door, with a note from her and directions to the restaurants she recommended. I'm telling you, everyone goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect! And everyone really did make us feel at ease and welcomed. The hotel itself: Located downtown therefore walking distance to many great shops and the Pacific Centre Mall is footsteps from the hotel. The famous 'Caffe Artigiano' is right around the corner from the hotel (btw great coffee!). It is also walking distance to Canada Place, Gastown etc. I did not try the fitness center but my husband enjoyed it. Would of loved to try the spa, perhaps on our next visit!

Lots of power, wireless. We finished off with a jaw-droppingly great breakfast at the Hawksworth restaurant - I'm still salivating. Earlier my wife and I wandered down to the lobby to get a coffee and were directed warmly to the lounge area where free coffee and newspapers were provided.

First time any hotel has ever had that level of forethought and attention to detail and I travel internationally many times a year. *On the morning of checkout, my excellent housekeeper who kept the room spotless, calls me by name and shared that she hoped I had enjoyed my stay. *Jim will put you in the Bentley saloon and truly transport you to a different place. He is gifted and passionate and the moments whiling away with him are truly special. Obviously I'm smitten along with the majority and the property is virtually perfect.

The driving instruction cards for nearby attractions were a valuable item provided by the concierge desk. I cannot say enough about the service provided by the entire staff and the way they made us feel so welcome and valued. Will definitely stay there again. Two small bits of feedback we provided the hotel were that (our room category, at least): 1) was short on drawer space to store our clothing, so we literally lived out of our suitcases for an extended stay, and 2) our room did not have a bathtub for our three year-old, so she got to experience a shower for the first time.

The attention to detail that has obviously gone into recreating the ambience of the original hotel really works. The bed was so comfortable, the turn-down service included several thoughtful little touches, the heated floor in the bathroom was great and the rainforest shower was amazing. We decided to have breakfast in the Hawksworth restaurant one morning and it was delicious, again with impeccable service.

And in all honesty the bed is THE MOST comfortable bed I have ever had the pleasure to sleep on. Truly fantastic! The pool is beautiful and although I didnt use the fitness room it looked great as well. I had breakfast twice and dinner once from roomservice. Again it was fantastic. Great service and great food. Hawksworth's is definatly worth a visit. I went for dinner. My server was efficient, knowlegable, not pretentious, and didnt hover and wasnt overly flamboyant which is what I prefer. To say the food was fantastic is an understatment. The drinks were amazing! Wow! Try a mint julep! Also the lobby bar is a nice place to have a quick bite and a refreshing drink if you have been out enjoying the city. Last time I was in Vancouver I stayed at Shangrila.

I travel a fair amount and have a very critical mind, but this hotel stay was nearly perfect in all ways. The extensive restoration retains the classic nature of the hotel, but incorporates almost any modern convenience one would want from a luxury hotel. From very first moment, making our reservation, the care and pride of the staff was clear. Dianne took personal care with our reservation, even though we were booking with the opening special rate. We arrived almost 2 hours before I had predicted and several hours before the official check in time. Grace checked us in and went to check the room to ensure it was ready for us (it had been cleaned but not signed off on yet). She came back down and informed us that it smelled like smoke (who smokes in a brand-new non-smoking hotel??). Even though we were early, they did not make us wait for another similar room to be available; they immediately upgraded us to a junior suite. Simply amazing service. Next great surprise, a knock at the door and the manager sent a bottle of sparkling wine and delicious chocolates, wishing us a happy anniversary (our 9th) (Dianne had asked when booking). The suite was unbelievable. Brand new so everything was perfect. But was also so tastefully decorated, conveniently laid out, and luxurious. We especially enjoyed the Nespresso machine (here's my one complaint, they offered only non-dairy creamer in the room, though the concierge kindly sent up half&half when I brought this up), the heated bathroom floor, the super comfortable bed, and the tv screens that acted as computer screens. Turn down and housekeeping fantastic. Bookmarks placed in books, cleaning wipes placed next to glasses cases, every thoughtful gesture made. The pool, spa and restaurant were great and as with the rest of the hotel, the staff were so genuinely excited about the hotel and eager to help, they made it all the better. We were poking around the conference rooms one night, and the conference manager saw us and gave us a full tour; again, his enthusiasm for the hotel was palpable. And don't miss a Manhattan in the hotel bar. A final quick mention of the wonderful concierge team. Everyone was ready and more than able to give great suggestions. Robert particularly took us under his wing with great charm, insight and just plain joy.

I found the valet, bell and front desk staff extremely attentive from the moment I arrived. The staff was very apologetic that I was frustrated at how hard it was to get into the valet parking area. I had to circle the block 3 times (Friday afternoon rush hour) which took almost half an hour. I can't blame the hotel for the traffic but the construction next to the hotel does obstruct the valet driveway which made entry to the hotel confusing. Once I was inside the staff took care of everything! The front desk was fast and efficient, the bell service was at my room within two minutes of my entry into the room and they even had a hotel staff showed me to my room and introduced me to the features. The room itself was elegant and tastefully decorated. Truth be told I had hoped to get a room on a higher floor (quieter) and a room with a separate sitting area. I didn't complain at the time so I shouldn't complain now, having said that I did like my room. I really enjoyed the rain shower and toiletries and the bed was very comfortable. Channel selection on the TV seemed limited and I had no pay per-view movies - only porn movies which seemed odd. The complimentary internet also worked great! My only complaint with my room was the noise from outside - which I knew I higher floor would have helped with. Another feature I liked were the historical cards turn down left in the room. These cards had information about celebrities that had stayed in the hotel, when they were born and died. One was about Elvis which I had to point out to the staff had the wrong date of death - they had 1970 written in the card. I know the last 7 years of his life weren't remarkable but I don't think we should forget about them entirely! I also did a spa treatment at Sense which was fantastic. The staff was incredible and beckoned to any need that I may have had. The pool was also nice; it's rare to have a lap pool in a hotel which I do enjoy. The entry to the pool was awkward, through the spa - and I think they could use some more signage in this area to help guests. I also used the gym. I'm a gym rat by nature and hotels never come close to offering weights that I can lift. The Rosewood gym was well equipped with Cardio equipment and they offered a series of machines for weight training - no free weights though. They need some rubber grip mats under the weight machines - the machines slide around on the wood floor when you are lifting heavy weights. In all it was an excellent hotel gym. I ate at Hawksworth for breakfast one day. The food was awesome! I also ate in the 1927 lounge which I would have loved to have sat in for longer. The 1927 lounge had great ambiance and a terrific barkeep! I also took advantage of the complimentary Bentley for a ride to the symphony which made the evening that much more! All in all I would highly recommend the Rosewood. Every hotel has issues, and the few issues the Rosewood may have are minor. The largest asset this property has is the staff, which is second to none! Everyone always stopped to talk to me regardless of what they were doing. If I was waiting for the elevator the housekeeper would stop and chat.

The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in at a hotel (Italian linens, big fluffy duvet, feather bed, etc). The room was spacious and the amenities amazing from the free standing tub, to the rainfall shower, dual vanities and two high tech switches for the all lighting, making it so easy to turn on all the lights, which lit up the room wonderfully. Not the usual strain to see across the room lighting which most hotels have. Finally, the little details of service like the turndown service where velvety soft towels and pillowy soft slippers are placed at the side of the bed, or the surprise birthday cake from management in our room and the wonderful espresso maker instead of the usual stale, bland coffee and cheap coffee makers usually found in hotel rooms...all of this made my one night at the Hotel Georgia the best night I have had in my many hotel stays, and just to give you a frame of reference, I do consider myself, a \"hotel snob.\" I am very picky about where I stay.

I had read that the Hotel Georgia had been recently renovated and I was lucky to find a really excellent price online (probably 1/2 of what the room should've cost), so we figured what the heck and splurged on a 5 star luxury hotel. Location The location is pretty prime - right downtown, across from the Art Museum and the Pacific Centre, and also very close to the central business district, for business travellers. There's a Canada Line stop a block away and its a short walk to Gastown, and the seabus terminal. The Hotel All I can say is \"wow\". The hotel has been renovated, from top to bottom - I understand they even cut the number of rooms from 300 to 155. The Hotel Georgia has long been the tradition luxury hotel in Vancouver (along with the Hotel Vancouver, which is nearby), so it has that very \"classic\" look to it. Credit to Rosewood keeping the same look and feel of the old hotel while modernizing it with all of the amenities you would expect nowadays in 5 star accommodations. The hotel has a new courtyard bar, called Reflections, which is becoming an \"it\" spot in Vancouver. It's completely outdoors, though partially covered (makes sense in Vancouver, given the rain) and a nice infinity pool. A number of the rooms face the courtyard, which can make it tricky if you want to go to bed early, but to the hotel's credit, they do last call at 11 at the bar and shut it down by 12. We weren't able to get a table at the restaurant, Hawksworth, but I hear its quite good. The hotel also has a full service spa, but due to our short stay, we didn't get a chance to try it out. The Room We stayed in a Luxury King Room (which is one up from their standard room), thanks to the upgrade. The room was beautiful and large especially the bathroom, (which was almost as big as the rest of the room), which had a full-sized soaker tub, his and hers vanities on opposite sides, and a shower with a \"rainforest-style\" shower head. Of course, the room has the standard \"luxury hotel\" features, such as 42\" HD Flat screen TV, super comfortable bed, room safe, etc. The room is on par with hotels of this class, though the bathroom is one of the best I've seen. Unlike some of the newer hotels, none of the rooms have views of the water or mountains, but you can see the mountains from anywhere in downtown Vancouver, and the city surrounded on all sides by water, so its not that big a deal. The Service Every second of our experience with the hotel was fantastic. Even making the reservation - the reservation agent, Bethany was incredibly helpful and even called me after I made the reservation to let me know she had upgraded our room at no extra charge. Then when we arrived, the staff was excellent, from the valet parking (very stylish hats fellas) to check-in, to the bellhop who showed us around the newly renovated room, to the concierge who fixed our dinner reservations, to Jim \"Mr. Bentley\" who drove us to and from dinner in the hotel's brand new Bentley (a great service the hotel offers if you ask) - what a way to travel! I almost forgot to mention that the hotel had chocolate dipped strawberries and a bottle of champagne on ice, with a lovely welcome note from management waiting for us in the room when we arrived. All in all, the service is top-notch. Bottom line: I would stay there again in a heartbeat and have no hesitation is recommending it for someone visiting Vancouver.

A couple weeks before our departure, we noticed the Rosewood Hotel Georgia opened. At first we reluctantly reserved our room there since it was so new. As most new hotels, the service could be a hit or miss and the amenities might not be readily available. However, we could resist the decor of the room, the central location, and beautiful indoor pool so we decided to give it a try. The services were simply wonderful. It was attentive yet not too intrusive. The staff were welcoming and friendly but not stuffy or stuck up as some of those from older luxury hotels. Everyone was helpful and polite from the valet parking attendant to the room service staff. The room was exactly as it is shown in the hotel's website photos. The pool was beautiful and spotless. We had room service and the food was very good. It was a bit on pricey side as it is a Rosewood hotel, but it is worth it if you are too lazy or tired to get dressed and go out. We also tried Hawksworth restaurant in the hotel. We were pleasantly surprised at how great the food was and the service was top notch. As for the negatives, there aren't a lot to discuss here. Just to be picky, they didn't have drink service at the pool area yet. We commented that on our survey and the general manager told us they are still waiting for alcohol license so that service should be available soon. The TV didn't work on the first night we were there. We didn't really care since we were not going to watch TV in Vancouver anyway, but it was fixed the next day as soon as we mentioned to the staff. This last issue is not the hotel but rather the restaurant. They didn't really have a proper dress code so you will see all kinds of people there. From couples in their suits and gown celebrating their special events to those \"lesser class\" who came in with shorts, t-shirts, flip-flops and expected immediate attention from the wait staff. If you ignore those around you, you would have an enjoyable meals as we did.

The entire staff are outstanding, most welcoming, hospitable, and takes great interest in your stay at their property. The entire staff are very proud to be at the Rosewood Hotel Georgia and their enthusiasm definitely shines through. The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful while very relaxing. I did not get that stuffy feeling you can get staying at a top luxury hotel. The hotel exudes a welcoming, sit down and relax feeling. The furnishings in the lobby are gorgeous and fits the decor perfectly. The room I had was on the 6th floor overlooking Howe Street. The room windows do open wide - how refreshing it was to find this. I could hear no noise at all, street level or outside the room. The room itself is luxury. The furnishings, color coordination, bed and bedding (the best ever) (sorry Frette) and lighting are perfection. I might also add very, very, comfortable, beautiful, and of the best craftsmanship. Touch lighting is utilized throughout the room. A computer keyboard in the desk drawer is available for use anytime and set up through the television system - and free of charge. A very nice touch and was used. I also liked the Seiko alarm clock that was stylish yet very simple to set an alarm. We know how hotels have gotten with trying to set an alarm on a clock. The bathroom - possibly the best I have encountered, Huge is not the word. You could live in the bathroom it is so big and beautiful. Everything is well thought out even down to the heated floor. You could have a party in the rainforest shower it is that big or possibly a smaller gathering in the soaking tub. All the amenities are there that one would expect at a luxury hotel and of the very highest quality. The fitness center/spa/pool are amazing. The fitness center has all the newest and latest equipment available in a wonderful and airy room to work out in. Again, all the nice touches one would look for at a hotel of the caliber are available. The pool area in my opinion is the second best feature of this hotel. Stunning, breathtaking, unbelievable are just a few words to describe this indoor pool area. Chairs, chaise lounges, couches, towels - again no expense spared in having the absolute best for this hotel. I actually felt like I was in some kind of Roman bath. You must stay if for anything the pool area. I did have breakfast at Hawksworth Restaurant. Decor, service, and food were excellent and price point was what is expected of a dining establishment of this high caliber. Absolutely no complaints for breakfast at Hawksworth. I utilized the business center and was very surprised to see two brand new Mac computers, the top of the line Mac computers for complimentary use. Being Mac illiterate, the hotel staff was most helpful in getting me started. The 1927 lobby bar was very nice, the drink was excellent, service outstanding, and pleasant, and overall a very relaxing time spent. Definitely have a drink or two there. The staff of the Rosewood Hotel Georgia is the #1 best feature of this property. Of the staff, the concierge staff I had multiple dealings with, Heather and Rob are the shining stars of the Hotel Georgia. Both are Members, Les Clefs d'Or Canada as well as the other team member of the concierge staff and one will be attaining membership into this prestigious organization in November, making the Rosewood Hotel Georgia the only hotel in Canada to have four Members Les Clefs d'Or Canada. This staff, again, particularly Heather and Rob know the city of Vancouver nside and out, all recommendations were right on, and some unusual requests were handled professionally, timely, and always with the result I the guest was looking for. My many interactions with this team certainly made me feel like I was their only guest. Heather and Rob are very special people and take pride in their work and pride in their hotel. I cannot highly recommend enough using their knowledge and services offered. As I said at the beginning of this review, all staff members are enthusiastic, proud of their job, and proud to be of any service to their guests to make the stay a very memorable on. I was fortunate to be able to utilize the Bentley car and driver, Jim, to the Pacific Central Station. What can I say, I will never forget the ride, the car, nor Jim. Jim is a pleasure to talk to, always smiling, cheerful, and cares so much about the guest. He is such an asset to this organization and someone I shall not forget. Professional and caring at all times -- what more can you ask for in an employee or a person. I actually had wished he could have hopped on the train with me so we could continue our discussions on various topics. I apologize for this lengthy report, however, I really wanted to give future guests a clear picture of this property. Remember please, the Rosewood Hotel Georgia had only been open 2.5 weeks, so there were some issues and definite oversights I saw during my stay. I will say every staff member took their time to listen to my suggestions, ideas, and thoughts and I believe took them to heart. I did not hesitate to let them know too, in a nice way. To give you a good idea, the following was what I found. I was skipped one night for turn-down service. Was offered a very sincere apology from the Front Desk Manager regarding this oversight that should have never happened. My room was rather small. Not the huge rooms I have encountered at other luxury hotels. Very little space for clothing. This in my opinion was the weakest and most disappointing part of the hotel. Actually had to have housekeeping come and get the extra pillows and blanket just to give myself more space in the closet. The business center with its new computers,etc., had absolutely no supplies to utilize that is readily available unless it was all hiding. The spa/fitness center/pool area - as absolutely beautiful as it is, offered none of the touches you will find at a luxury property's spa/fitness center/pool, i.e., lockers, (there were only 2), places to sit and change, and all the toiletries that are offered that take it a step higher. No footwear to use while in this area nor were there robes to put on. Also, there was no place to put the wet swimsuit but this issue has been addressed and there will be a suit dryer installed as soon as the equipment gets in. I was very disappointed and surprised to see how lacking this area was in comparison to a Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Shangri-La, Pan-Pacific, and Fairmont properties fitness center/pool area. However, Lenny, Spa Receptionist was outstanding, proactive in tackling my dilemma, and solved my problem. She is definitely the kind of member you want on your team to take you to the top. Again, this was an outstanding stay, all the comforts one could want or ask for. The staff unsurpassed on their duties. The strongest asset of this hotel. However. to reach that pinnacle of being \"the best Vancouver hotel\" it is the small attention to details that separate properties as they are all in the general price range. This is where the Rosewood Hotel Georgia still needs improvement. It will be the little things that take it to the top and a 5-star rating. I will be back and cannot wait to see and notice the changes and the evolving nuances that take place to achieve this hospitality ranking as #1 place to stay in Vancouver.

A superb lap pool and modern fitness centre are on the 4th floor, a popular restaurant and the lobby lounge are located on the ground floor.
