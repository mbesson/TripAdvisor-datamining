Luckily this hotel didn't have this problem, it was just a little bit tatty. The website said it had been recently refurbished... well, I'd like to know how many years ago! Yes, the room doors were fairly new and inside the room the headboard and furniture were relatively new, but it stopped there. The bathroom was VERY tatty, the shower in particular was very old, the tiles were old and the grouting a bit dirty, the shower curtain was too small and didn't fit the opening. The tiled floor in the bedroom wasn't particularly clean so I felt the need to wear slippers when walking around the room - although this wasn't easy in the tiny space available! I'd read previous comments about the rooms being small, but thought I could cope with that for three days. The room literally has barely enough space to walk around the beds. All the bedroom pictures on the website show 'stretched' images to make the rooms look bigger. My suitcase wouldn't fit underneath the table where the old style TV sits, so I had to move the seat from under the dressing table to fit my case there. There was also a patch of mould on the wall under the air-conditioning unit, not very attractive. The hallway was also tatty, the plaster around the lift area had been knocked off over the years and never tidied up. There is no WiFi as mentioned on their website. I enquired at reception and was told I would have to buy a Telefonica card for 24 hours for 12 euros which would start as soon as I started using it and couldn't be switched on and off. The signal apparently doesn't always work so the reception don't offer it. I told them they should remove it from their website but they couldn't see anything wrong with leaving it on there. The cafeteria/breakfast room is not worth paying a visit. The charge was 6 euros for breakfast which included 1 coissant, 1 bread role, 1 glass of orange juice and 1 cup of coffee from a vending machine. Across the main road there was a very nice cafe which served a similar breakfast (waiter service) for 4.70 euros!", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Patagonia, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cVery small rooms\u201d", "Author": "smittyba", "ReviewID": "UR118256941", "Content": "We had to sit on the bed while the other moved in room.

It's less than a minute to walk to Barceloneta Metro station and is convenient for the City and the sea front. The popular Born area is just across the road (full of cafes and bars and a stones throw from the Picasso museum) as is the Park and Zoo. If you're travelling on a budget, you can often get this hotel for 50euros a night - good for a hotel in BCN. The Bad: The hotel is very tired. The rooms are very, very small with drab decoration and faded fabrics. The ensuites are little bigger than a wardrobe and the walls (as is often the case in hotels) are very thin - a nightmare if you get noisy neighbours. My Experience: I've stayed here twice now - the first time with no issues at all aside from a tempremental key card! My most recent visit was blighted by noisy neighbours who would return in the early hours and make as much noise as possible. The check in has been smooth and friendly and the accommodation has met my basic needs for a place to wash and sleep. In conclusion, if your needs are basic, you're on a budget and prefer a hotel over a hostal then this hotel could be for you - provided you don't pay over the odds. However, If you like to spend time in your hotel room and have exacting standards, push the budget and look elsewhere.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town Central, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cGreat positioned budget hotel\u201d", "Author": "JohnE312659", "ReviewID": "UR102191389", "Content": "I have stayed here each Feb for the last 5 years when I attend a conference in Barcelona.

After arriving with my girlfriend to Barcelona we headed to the hotel (Gallardo group). Here is a brief description of the experience: 1) As we arrived there the manager told us that the floors were being painted, and that we could not stay at that hotel. He was actually saying \"don't worry we will find you something nice\" or \"no te preocupes te voy a correr una habitacion muy buena\". The guy was a joke. Does he think that other people are dum? Why didn't they told us that when we booked the hotel or why were we allowed to book that hotel 2 weeks before? 2) The abovementioned manager told us that we could have a room at another hotel - named Suisso. He actually tod us that it was just a 5 minute stroll. It turned out to be a 20 minute walk... 3) As we arrived at that hotel the manager told us that there were no rooms available only some apartments in a nearby building. The apartment that we got was clean but old, weird - the walls were painted in shades of grey, and poorly isolated as we heard everything from the streets (calle). Moreover, that building had no security and was always busy, with a lot of strange people getting in all the time. To be honest it seemed as if it had a brothel (cathouse) on one of the floors. And it was not really an aprtment as it had no kitchen. In conclusion the hotel experience was a total scam. I think that these gentlemen\u2019s should be banned from the hotel business.

The wardrobes are really tiny so not good if you take lots of things and there wasn\u2019t enough space to store the suitcases anywhere so we had to put them on the floor at night and on the beds in the day time. I had booked two rooms as we were going for a friends hen party (there were 4 females), when we checked in we were given rooms on different floors even though we requested that they be near each other, when we asked if we could have rooms near each other the man on reception became rude and nasty with us stating that we had made 2 separate bookings when I had in fact booked and paid for the rooms in one transaction. We let this go and went to our separate rooms not wanting anything to ruin our holiday. At 2 o clock in the morning (the first night) a strange man came into my friend\u2019s room whilst they were both asleep- luckily the light from the hall woke them up and he disappeared (one benefit of small rooms) a few minutes later a psycho woman next door started shouting and swearing, she turned her TV up full and started banging on their wall continuously.

They both had to seek refuge in mine and my sisters room (four woman in 2 single beds) none of us slept for the rest of the night.

At first he tried telling us that they couldn\u2019t have a new room even though we said that they did not feel safe in that room. When he realised that we weren\u2019t going to let the matter drop he made some phone calls and offered my friends a room on the same floor as my room. Their new room was twice the size of their old room. After this we were very wary and hired a safe- not wanting to take any chances.

We arrived in the beautiful city of Barcelona, and took a cab to the hotel, It took 2 hours to get checked in, and when we finally got to our room, I could of cried. The room stank, there was actual sick over walls, blood in the bed, the loo hadn't been cleaned from the previous guests, The lamps were hanging off the walls, you could see the wires hanging out, it was just horrid. We went to the reception to complain, and the chap at the desk decided he couldnt speak any English - even though he had perfect English when we checked in! Anyway, when we started to raise our voices, he said someone would come and clean the room, so we headed into Barcelona to start our holiday whist they cleaned the crap up. After a long day of sighseeing, and eating Tapas, we headed back to our room, and there was a hole in the door, and the room had been broken into, they stole my boyfriends shoes, my coat, sunglasses, makeup, toiletries, even my pj's!! basically everything that wasnt in our suitcases, We ran to reception to report this, and there was another couple there who had had money and passports stolen, again, the guy behind reception decided he couldnt understand us, and couldnt speak any English. The 4 of us then went to the Police Station to report the crime, The Police were brill and took the details, and said that they would come to the hotel the next day to look around, I must say, I was a bit scared to stay there that night, I would of loved to of checked out that night, and found another hotel, but my boyf pursuaded me to stay, : ( Anyway, the police came round the next day, and they even took photo's of our room, to be honest, I think this had happened before at this hotel. On another night, we were off out, and opened the lift door, just about to step in, and the electric went off, we were in complete darkness, OMG, we could of been in that blooming lift! So, basically, what I'm trying to say, please please try and find a different hotel to stay in, Barcelona is a fab city, I cant wait to go back, but I will steer clear from this [--]! xcuse my french!", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "sweden", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "elsen", "ReviewID": "UR8226304", "Content": "Great hotel, do not get scared by other peoples stories!

Firstly do not follow the hotel's instructions to get to the hotel by train from the airport-this involves 3 train and metro changes when actually the train from the airport goes every half hour to the estacio de franca which is right outside the hotel! so so easy and costs only 2.50 euros. Check in was easy, didnt even have to speak really, were just handed key! Room was very tiny, but modern, clean and bright with a little balcony overlooking a very cute square. Beds were fine, shower good and room cleaned and towels changed every day by truly lovely staff. Some rooms are situated arund a square landing and others off a corridor. Ours was on a corridor which meant there were noises from the corridor (but thats probably our fault for sleeping in til lunchtime!) But I never heard a peep from any neighbours, so I think the walls between rooms are very well soundproofed. Best thing about the hotel was the location, lovely 10 min walk along the seafront to la ramblas and port vell. very close to barcelonetta metro station which is on a very convienient line. A short walk through cute little old streets to all the major tourist attractions, and a 5 min hop to the beach! The whole area is described as the 'hippest' in barcelona and felt very safe. yes the street outside the hotel is a bit smelly, but lots in the old town are! Overall remarkably good value for money, the hotel is two star mainly duue to its lack of facilities, though it does provide a free breakfast and other meal, though we never tried them. Please do not be put off by bad reviews, i would stay there again, a bargain for \u00a325 per person a night!", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North West of England", "Title": "\u201cLike the Curate's Egg - good in parts...\u201d", "Author": "SusanBJennings", "ReviewID": "UR6901801", "Content": "If you want a cheap hotel that is extremely close to the main train station, a stone's throw from shops, cafes and bars, and where rooms are cleaned daily, this is the place to stay. If you want light and airy, spacious and well-appointed, with great views and facilities, I'm afraid you're going to draw the short straw, especially if you get to the hotel when the majority of its rooms are full with a coach party of students and you end up at the top/back of the hotel. My partner and I booked a room here through an accommodation website on the net, as we had never been to Barcelona before and wanted a VERY CHEAP place to stay. And for us, the stay was very cheap - the equivalent of \u00a330 a night (for the room, not per person). The Pros: the hotel is literally a two minute walk from the station - even with luggage - and less than a 10 minute walk to the Ramblas, the harbour area, the city's best park, and the main bus stops for the Bus Tourista - the best value way to find out about the city on your first visit - 23 Euros at the time of writing for a two-day ticket. Each room at the hotel has its own bathroom facilities, even if these (in some rooms) are below the standard you would normally expect when staying in, say, a 3 Star hotel in London. The 'baths' are more like 2ft deep shower trays, so forget long soaks. Each room has bedside lights, a dressing table, a wardrobe and a small TV. Again, not up to some people's standards - just the basic channels in Spanish - so don't complain about the lack of Sky Sport. The reception area seems to be manned 24 hours a day, and while the staff I met weren't exactly 'Mr Congeniality', I think the language difficulties didn't help. While I never got to chat in more than a superficially friendly way with any of the staff, they were helpful whenever help was required. The Cons: the hotel is a typical bargain-end Spanish establishment, so yes, people will be hanging around in the bar/dining room, smoking, while having a very relaxed attitude to food hygiene rules. That's what they do: it's Spain. When we arrived, we were given a very small, dark room at the back of the hotel, with which I was prepared to 'make do' until I tripped on a loose fragment of bathroom tile (two or three were damaged). So the next day, I asked if we could move rooms. The chap was a bit 'put out' and said: \"Why didn't you say you didn't want the room last night?\" Fair comment, I thought, but I explained that a coach-load of students had just turned up, the place was heaving and I didn't want to cause a scene at reception. He shrugged in acknowledgement and after the head housekeeper was sent to the room with us (so that he could find out what was upsetting me), we got our room change. As for the coach-load of students, well some of the little darlings behaved just as you might expect and there were lots of 'technical difficulties' with the lift, while some of the wooden surfaces around the hotel now have charming little carvings, courtesy of the more artistic among them. While other reviewers have talked about shortcomings with some of the equipment /facilities in the rooms, I think, to be fair, a lot of this is down to damage caused by some of the hotel's guests. While I did asked to be moved because of damaged floor tiles, I don't think the hotel can be held responsible for how people behave. And as for comments about people sleeping on the pavement outside the hotel...well I have seen far worse on the streets of London. Like any big city, there is deprivation and hardship, which is always upsetting. But for the four days I stayed in this hotel, I didn't experience any problems immediately outside or around the building, even after dark. I think it is well worth considering this as a cheap, 'no frills' clean, safe base, simply because of where it is in relation to everything you'd want or need in the city during your stay.", "Date": "March 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "dalkeith", "Title": "\u201cSmelly and filthy\u201d", "Author": "tommytwoone", "ReviewID": "UR6842583", "Content": "Our party of eight were booked into this hotel after Globespan messed up our origional hotel booking.
