It's one step up from a nice hostel, so the money I paid (59 E per night) seemed a little steep. With that said, once I realized the location was so great, it made me appreciate the hotel a little more. The rooms were clean and bed was comfortable; there is free wi-fi (which I find a necessity when traveling); the staff was very friendly and helpful; and....did I mention the location? What I didn't like was the communal bathrooms. Not averse to sharing a bathroom, but they weren't always clean and all three showers had VERY slow drains. My last night there I was switched to a room with a private bath, which was nice, because I had made another reservation to stay an extra night. If you stay here, try to get an in-room toilette/shower. Located in the old East Germany, the hotel location, as I mentioned, is superb! It is a block from the U6 and 1 1/2 from the U2. A 5-10 minute walk from Checkpoint Charlie made this my first stop. About 4-6 blocks from Gendarmenmarkt and a little farther to Unter den Linden. The other way, it's about a 3-4 block walk to Topografie des Terrors, where a portion of the actual Berlin Wall still stands in its original place. A couple of blocks up from that is where Hitler killed himself in one of his bunkers. The Brandenberger Tor is about a 20-30 minute walk, as is the memorial to the murdered Jews. In terms of location, the best part is the easy access to the U-Bahn. Hotel itself is okay and I would only recommend it to friends who didn't mind low budget, mostly clean accommodations in a cool, historical location.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIf you don't want to sleep much go to M68\u201d", "Author": "Moonbabyxox", "ReviewID": "UR100202551", "Content": "Chose the hotel because of the location and stayed for some 3-4 nights. The room - quite clean, the bed broken, one of the light bulbs on the ceiling was blinking so annoyingly. Bathroom is not attached, so had to walk to the end of the corridor to use it - quite clean. No chance to sleep after 7 am - cos of the pub downstairs, they serve breakfast from 7 am and play music. All noise in the building can be heard in the room such as ... next door etc. They allow smoking in the bathroom downstairs and it smells all over the hotel including the rooms, not pleasant. The staff isn't professional, but very friendly.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel M68", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1222646-Reviews-Hotel_M68-Berlin.html", "Price": "$55 - $96*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Mauerstrase 68</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10117</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1222646", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/33/77/337733d0f829a129afeeff16bf9eee755large.jpg"}}
