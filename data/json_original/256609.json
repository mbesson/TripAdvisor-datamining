Stayed at the property on night of 27th November, for Andre Rieu concert. Hotel was very full, staff were absolutely professional and friendly in every aspect. Room service meal was very tasty and reasonably priced. Room clean and functional a little dated (nearly 10 years since the Olympics). Breakfast on 28th in breakfast room topped off a lovely visit.

We had been here before in 2006 and had a pleasant stay but not nearly as good as this time. The staff were very pleasant and simply a delight to speak with. From check in our breakfast, everyone was very friendly. We had a couple of issdues with the room as the room had not been made up on our second night and an issue with teh air con. Both request were dealt with immediately. The receptionist was lovely and called up back to follow up that our request was actioned. We were very impressed. The rooms are a bit outdated, whihc we told the porter at departure, fortunately ther are getting a face lift next year.

We were going to see an AFL game at ANZ stadium which was right across the road, very convenient, perfect location.Check in was good, they were quite busy but the girls on the front desk were very friendly and obliging we even got a free upgrade to an executive spa suite.The suite itself was good but is starting to show it age, I feel this property is ready for refurbishment. Surface wise the room was clean however beyond that there were very dirty finger marks on light switches, doors and marks down walls. The bathroom decor was dated and tired looking, the large soap pumps attached to the walls were a bit daggy. However the spa bath itself was massive and worked a treat after an afternoon of walking around Olympic Park with our scootering children.The bed was great, King sized and soooo soft and comfy, my husband and I slept very well, however, the pillows were bad! Old and lumpy. I was so glad we bought our own pillows with us.Breakfast the next morning was outstanding, a massive variety, well cooked and well stocked. Overall we had a great night away, we were happy with the hotel but just feel that it needs a bit of a face lift. With a refurbishment this property would be amazing. If you have children you must go to Wentworth Common in the park, a great play area for children, sandpits, climbing webs, flying fox and a great cycle track.

Request for sufficient towels for 4 people (don\u9225\u6a9b they think children wash either??) also took four hours. We stayed in a queen room with a terrace overlooking Telstra Stadium- a miniscule balcony with just enough room for a small table and two chairs. After leaving appropriate feedback we received an email from the guest relations manager apologising for our disappointing stay, and offering to handle our future reservation requirements personally. Thought this was nice, maybe give them another go, just in case our experience was a one-off. Well, I emailed him a few weeks later, saying we would like to stay again, could he please make a reservation for a date three weeks hence. It took over two weeks to get a reply by which time I\u9225\u6a87 given up and booked elsewhere. There was one positive though. As there is no pool at the Hotel, complimentary entry to the Aquatic Centre is provided.Okay, so if you want to go to the footy or see a concert and not have to travel, there's not much choice, but I'd spend the money on a taxi next time and stay somewhere else.", "Date": "Aug 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR355794376", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "loulou1960"}, {"Content": "Awesome Hotel Wow, What a great hotel.

Having been here during the Olympics as a volunteer, we thought we would give it a go. To our relief we found the hotel and most of all the staff utterly wonderful. The park has developed greatly over the years with lots of food offerings available, always something happening in the Park (we went to the baby expo with our daughter). Transport has improved, and the whole park looks like a veritable entertainment area. Much to my husband's pleasure we went to DFO after the baby expo, while he stayed in the hotel to have a beer and read the newspaper in the bar area overlooking Telstra Olympic Stadium. The hotel was clean, fresh and happy, though it should start looking at updating its furniture (though most hotels need to come to think of it). A gold star to all the staff who were most obliging, friendly, had time to spend wth you even when there was lots to do and did not mind having a chat with an old bird!

We were there with local friends on a busy night (big rugby match-origin match) . The hotel was very exciting, w got our rooms straight away at 1300 then we went to the pub under the hotel. It was a great atmosphere. I must say that of all hotels we have stayed, the staff were the best we had come across. They were polite and good to deal with. The food was excellent for Aussie food. We had a burger in the pub bistro and that night we were part of a group booking in the restaurant and the food was excellent. I loved the energy. Tank you for a beautiful time.

The hotel advertises itself as a 4 1/2 star hotel, but nowhere was this star-level evident.At check-in, even with a growing number of people waiting, no additional check-in counters were opened (and there were about 5 counters unattended). Some visitors who cut the queue were not told to wait their turn and instead were served. During check-in, we were told that we have been upgraded to a terrace room. Sadly, the terrace room turned out to be a smoking room (bad if you have allergies and specifically asked for a non-smoking room), single bedded (I wondered where they expect one of us to sleep?) We were told that parking was $40 even when the hotel website said $20 (be warned). Going back down to reception, waiting in queue again, we were conveniently told that we were given the wrong room keys.The room itself was a letdown. The carpet was shabby, the walls needed a fresh coat of paint. The TV was old, tiny and the picture was flickering. The bed was lumpy and the pillows were floppy.

This is my first hotel review and I cannot belive this happened so close to home. I felt compelled to write this review given the difficulties I encountered at a large hotel recently. Having stayed at hundreds, if not thousands of hotels, I have never had such an appalling experience and been treated so rudely in all my life.I recently stayed at the Novotel Sydney Olympic Park with a number of family friends to attend a large family function nearby.From the moment we arrived the experience was apalling...just to highlight a few of the problems that ruined the experience and to serve as a warning to other potential guests:1. We had booked a large number of rooms and asked that these be allocated near each other in the hotel. This was not done (our rooms were spread over varied levels), despite repeated calls to the hotel booking line to confirm this. It is important that anyone staying here with a large group be aware of this problem. 2. Also, when we arrived we found that the rates quoted for rooms via the hotel booking line were incorrect. 3. The keys to our rooms continually did not work. Given many of us were time pressured on the day of the function we attended, it was very inconvenient to be regularly locked out of our rooms.4. Our room was VERY small, even though a large room had been specifically requested on booking. This large room had been confirmed to be available on confirmation calls to the hotel just days before arrival. On arrival we were told all rooms were the same size. 5. The safe and air conditioning in our room did not work. Multiple requests to fix this were ignored. The keys to the car park did not work either. The car park was continually full and even when parking had been paid for, our car ended up on the street outside.6. Any attempts made to approach staff or management to rectify any issues were extremely unpleasant. 7. Our credit card was cancelled due to lack of funds, as on arrival we were asked to leave credit card details for a deposit (a common practice at most large hotels), but after check out the credit card still did not work days later, as the holding deposit had not been cancelled off the credit card that was swiped on arrival.8. Most recently, and the final straw, occurred when our credit card was charged multiple times for the one booking, as the blank credit card slip we left unsigned as part of our deposit, had been signed by someone else, so we were charged again. Despite proving the second signtaure was fraudulent, it took great effort to have the money refunded onto my credit card.I would like to have ended with some positives, it's just that there aren't any.
