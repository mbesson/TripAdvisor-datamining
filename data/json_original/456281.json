We were given a handicap room which I thought was small. The tub was higher than most tubs in other hotels. It did have a seat in the tub for my mother to use but to get out was higher than she could handle. When we arrived the clerk was extremely friendly and helpful. The lobby was clean and elegant. Upon opening the door we found the room clean. The beds were okay but the pillows were flat. We did ask for four more pillows which we were given with a smile. The next day after returning to our room the beds were made and we had fresh towels but the bathroom sink was not touched. It still had toothpaste and hair as we left it. The same piece of lint was on the bathroom floor all three days which tells me they did not sweep the floors. The breakfast was just okay. They had hot and cold cereal, yogurt, wheat bread for toasting, ready made waffles, individual wrapped very small sausage and biscuit sandwiches, individual wrapped egg burritos, bananas (the only fruit they offered), cake donuts, coffee and juices. The sandwiches and burritos were cold and you had to cook them yourself in the microwave. The breakfast was suppose to be until 9:30 and one day around 9:15 the girl taking care of the breakfast was cleaning up and putting food away. One day they ran out of fruit and yogurt. So I suggest going early. I know there is no thing as a perfect hotel but if you want a hotel that is located off the busy streets and friendly staff this is your hotel. What we liked about the hotel was indoor corridors and mostly flat parking. Even though they did not clean our room and the breakfast was not the best I would probably stay here again. Most of the rooms or units were time share. We were not asked to listen to a presentation or asked to buy a unit(I really appreciated that).", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "thebunches", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING!!\u201d", "Author": "thebunches", "ReviewID": "UR38073498", "Content": "LOVED everything!
