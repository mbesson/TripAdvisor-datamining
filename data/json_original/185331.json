They had never been away on vacation and wanted to stay within a budget. I like to be close to Playa del Carmen, preferable Playa Car and like the beach in that area so the Azteca is what i came up with. A couple months ago we stayed at the Rui Palace in Cancun and Next door to the Azteca in Playa Car. Personally i did not like it but from a budget minded, first timer to Mexico or child it was a hit with all of them. I didn't mind that it was a smaller hotel, i liked the beach, the proximetry to Playa del Carmen, they had the best pizza and you could grab a late night bite to eat. The housekeeping staff were efficient and made all the usual towel art daily. I always found something at the buffet but pretty typical of a 2/3 star resort. Nothing fabulous but not horrible either. I booked our flight and room seperate and had the option and had the option to book a ground floor room, in the renovated side, smoking, ocean front so that what i booked. We got a 3rd floor with a glimps of the ocean in the unrenovated side with a balcony you could not even go out onto, not to mention it was right above the pool bar so very loud at night on a few occasions. Go figure, on our 3rd day they called to say we could move but by then our 9 yr.old had dudads hanging from the lampshades and all our cloths were out and about so we figured we would just hang out. Plus we had booked an excursion that day and were not prepared to move. The unrenovated side was well below what i would ever wish to stay in again. Bathtub faucets were painted over with somekind of white paint, 1 sink, small in general. The decor was bad just everything from bed linens to curtains,cabinetry or lack of it. The T.V was relatively new. I can already here people saying well it's just a room you only sleep in it. No i like a nice room, linens, space and defiantly was willing to pay extra at this resort for something close to that. Good news is that someone said they are doing another major renovation this fall :) No drink service anywhere at all !!! Ok crappy wine at the buffet but thats it. The wine at the poolbar seemed better. I did read this in reviews before i went and knew i would have to suffer through almost 2 weeks but again it was within the budget i had to work with. Overall the liquor was ok if you requested top self and begged for a straw. With limited services everywhere i imagine thats how they keep costs down. Plates were were cleared promptly, staff appeared to be tending to the grounds and general cleaning. The grounds were nothing like other resorts i have been to in Mexico in regards to foilage, flowers and decor. The pool was crowded and small but was cleaned daily. On the up side, our friends and all the kids loved the resort and would go back in New York minute.The location to Playa del Carmen and the beach are excellent. The pool was a big hit with all the kids, activities on the beach and at the pool went on everyday. The pizza, hamburgers and french fries were endless. They went to the shows everynight, what more could a parent/grandparent ask for. hmm let me think.... So it was a fantastic vacation had by all. Sometimes you just have to roll with punches and make dreams come true even if they are not yours. Sadly we couldn't get anyone in our group to agree to go to any of the a la cartes, the kids either didn't want to go or their parents didn't bring appropriate wear so we didn't rock the boat. I love some fine dinning or at the very least decent table service. We did alot of off resort excursions, xcaret, swimming with the dolphins, cenotes, Akumal, shopping, endless hours of playing in the pool and at the beach so overall on a budget it fit the bill. I would never choose this resort unless i was on a budget, had a kid or a few or it was my first time to Mexico.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "texas", "Title": "\u201cwonderful time...\u201d", "Author": "TexasShay", "ReviewID": "UR126200443", "Content": "we have been to several places in playa del carmen area and we enjoyed staying at Azteca, the beach was nice, the staff were lovely and we enjoyed our time there.

Now about the hotel. Both check in and check out went quickly and smoothly. The staff is multilingual. No problem finding someone who will understand you. There are no elevators at this resort so a porter will help bring up your luggage. Our room (2316) was always spotless as was the rest of the resort. The only negative note is the comfort of the beds. A little hard and we had a tendency to roll towards the middle. Other than this detail we loved our stay and would recommend it.

The \u00c0 la Carte restaurants (oriental and mayan) are absolutely scrumptious. The beach is beautiful and clean. The sand is flour-like and the water is turquoise.

Our adult children enjoyed many excursions; Para-sailing, snorkeling, jet skiing,deep sea fishing and zip-lining through the jungle. The poolside bar had the best guacamole and lunches. We are not big drinkers so I cannot comment on the state of the bar except the beer was light or dark, Dos Equis and the wine was quite satisfactory.

We had always stayed at bigger resorts but thought we would try a smaller one so we wouldn't have such a walk to the pool or beach. It was great that way-- we were so close it took less than a minute to get to the pool, beach or buffet. (We stayed in the 2000 building). The snack bar was great and there was never a long line-up for anything. They did have a lot of activities for guests such as darts, bocce ball, dancing, bingo, and water games in the afternoon. We are usually beach people but our kids prefer the pool so we were there quite a bit. The pool is a good size as long as there aren't too many people in it. The buffet has a lot of variety and was very good-- very comparable to other resorts we have stayed at. What I found was annoying was that there were never any lounge chairs at the pool and the people that had their towel on them weren't there for most of the time. I guess it is like this at every resort I am sure so \"if you can't beat them, join them\" and that is just what I did. I got up one morning at 6:00a.m. And put our towels on 2 of the lounge chairs--at this time already more than half of the chairs already had towels on them. The night shows were good-- we only went to 2, the comedy show and the circus, well worth the time. The comedy show was really funny actually.

This was only our second trip to the Riviera Maya, and the beach at the Azteca was as nice as our first resort in Playa del Carmen (which we understand is a plus in staying in that area). We're not excessive drinkers, but we did miss having drinks delivered on the beach this year, & our room bar was only filled on the first day & with non-alcoholic drinks. The restaurant service was great, and the food was OK, but we did appreciate the variety in the evening buffets. There was a change in food themes for the night buffets, and that made for a nice variety. It was also a treat to be able to eat outside at the buffet, if a table was available, and we did eat at all three of the specialty restaurants. It wasn't difficult to get reservations there, and the Mayan was actually our favorite, even though we ate a lot of that type of food during the week. The hard working employees were what really impressed us. There was always cleaning staff sweeping, cleaning windows, etc. and the landscaping was very nice and they were often working hard on it while we were there, so it was well maintained. The entertainment staff was always trying to involve guests in activities, and they also did a great job. It was very evident that the resort caters to Italian guests, but that may be because the resort was previously owned by an Italian company? When their groups gathered at the bars & on the beach, they took over. That made it more difficult for some of us who speak English to get served. The rooms were more basic, but very well cleaned by the staff. We had a problem with the in-room hair dryer, and after letting the front desk know, we had someone there replacing it with minutes! We were told when we arrived that the in-room safe could be rented for $2 a day, but the information provided on the TV regarding our room indicated it was free. So we used it a couple days, and then were told by the front desk that we needed to pay for it. My husband was going to talk with the hotel manager, who wasn't there at the time, & although I don't think we should have paid for the previous days, he just paid for the entire time ten days. Another advantage of the Azteca is that you can use the facilities of the Viva Wyndham Maya (larger than the Azteca) which is close and can be easily walked to. We ate the buffet there one evening which was very good, and also spent some time walking their beach/pool area. The Mayan has an open theater area, which we would have preferred to the Azteca's small, upstairs theater. There's also a small mall with souviners/ jewelry, local crafts that is across from the Mayan, so easily in walking distance of the Azteca.

You may get a few, but they move quickly to avoid getting in trouble with the security Cons -Beach and pool side chairs can be a bit of a problem unless you get up before the sun and stake out a spot. It's a shame that people put towels/shoes and other belongings on chairs to secure a spot and it can sit that way for the whole day, no one ever using them -Evening entertainment is a bit cheesy, the entertainment staff is the same group of people that organize the sport etc. through the day. Not a problem for us, but if you're expecting Broadway, you'll be disappointed. -The ride from Cancun can take anywhere from an hour to almost 2 depending on how many other hotels they are dropping off other guests to. A number of other hotels we had to stop at weren't designed with large buses in mind. We had to endure our bus driver inching back and forth for 20 minutes in an attempt to get the bus pulled into the front entrance.

The a la carte restaurants are really really good, especially the italian (Azteca) and mexican (in Wyndham Maya) and my GF is italian. Use the 3 nights per week!!! The snacks at the beach bar are very tasty and we never used the restaurant for lunch. Coctails are super! Especially the range and taste of the non-alcoholic ones! Beach: Very clean, not too crowded, no problem to find a good place even later. The sand is very nice, also the sea. Entertainment: The animation is very active, but not too annyoing. It was always fun and we were never bored. All watersports activities (without engine) are included, try out the sailing and kayaking! The night animation is very funny and worth to watch. Rooms: We started with a room in the \"family\" house, off the beach, but after asking at the reception we got a nice room at the pool with a nice view and Wifi access. The minibar is only refilled once when you arrive. We didn`t like the bed-sheets, they were kinda sticky. Clean, but the fabric was weird. Pool area: It's not very big but the little time we spent there we enjoyed. The shape is nice because you can sit in the water. Overall the hotel is very nice, more quiet than the bigger Maya and we would definitly come back!", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood family place\u201d", "Author": "MR S", "ReviewID": "UR123036866", "Content": "We stayed between Dec 28-Jan 4. Two adults, 8 & 12 year old Rooms (1000 Series) -Very clean and bright. Very clean, modern bathroom; rainfall shower head was a bonus. Fridge was stocked. It would be nice to receive bottled water daily but we were ok with filling our water bottles at the pool bar. We originally were placed in the rooms (3000 series) near the lobby bar, but asked to be moved as the music was too loud. First room was a bit older and musty. Food & Drinks--We LOVED the main dining hall buffet. Guacamole and salsa fresh everyday. Lots of variety for all family members. Pizza, salad and other finger foods at the pool bar were very good too! Bar staff very pleasant and accomodating too. Beware: Ate at the Italian restaurant at the sister Viva-Wyndham resort and was sick the next day! Beach--One of the most beautiful beach strips. Needed to get to the beach early to reserve chairs for four but we were there during high season. Entertainment & Activites: Lots to do. Villaggio Bravo Animazione Staff constantly arranging beach and pool activities and games. Evening shows were a bit cheesy. The hotel put on a nice festivities and a special , very abundant food spread on New Year's Eve. Lots of Champagne to go around. Staff--Most staff were pleasant and helpful.

My family of 4, my wife and two sons 21 and 20 traveled on American Airlines with no problems as usual, we fly on them regularly and have had great service. We took the bus from Cancun ADO which cost 110 pesos then a cab for 7 dollars, I would recommend paying for everything in peso, exchange rate is right at 13.3 at most kiosks. Upon arriving at the hotel, the front desk staff was great along with a nice cold beverage being brought up as we are checking it. The front desk staff Alex and a nice German lady who's name I missed was very nice, don't know why anyone could have a problem with them, unless they are trying to get something they don't deserve. We were in rooms 2112 and 2110 ground floor, with a view of the pool and a very short walk to the 24 hour food bar area and the awesome beach. Since I am a member of the Wyndham preferred club were given bracelets that allowed us to use a part of the beach which had cushioned lounge chairs, but the reserve game was on for sure, but since I get up early along with our whole family we did not have a problem. I went to guest services to arrange for our dinners, I spoke with Patricia who was wonderful and took care of us. The rooms were nice, with a small frig that was stoked daily with water, diet pepsi, 7up and pepsi, since we were a preferred members that happened daily, for others it is not offered. The water pressure was great, hot when needed, the room safe was included and we used it. The internet was fine, a little slow but who needs the internet in Mexico. Beds were firm, not bad, the locks worked fine, slippers and robe in the closet, wash cloths were provided and good soap and shampoo. We bring our own anyways. TV was a flat panel with good channels for late night watching. I would rate the room on par with most hotels in the states but with a Mexican charm, all tile and on the beach. Beach was great, nice and clean with lots of huts and lounge chairs. An added benefit was plenty of trash cans and places to put your used cups to be cleaned. The towel service was fine, no problems, the staff would ask if you wanted to participate, but did not push it. We played darts and a couple of games and did the aerobics in the pool. Temperature of the water was a little cool getting in, but once in great. Scuba on site was wonderful, they took complete care of us, from start to finish. My son's got 4 dives in and one completed his open water certificate. They did have to walk to the sister resort Viva Maya a 7 minute walk on the beach, which was no big deal. I would recommend the shop for access and the price. I walked to the Viva Maya twice to watch the scuba shop guys work the shop, they entered the water and boarded the boat from the shore, nice set up. My boys, saw Moray Ells, turtles, manta ray and assorted fish. Other guest, lots of Italians, nice folks, some Americans and Canadians. Bars, the one by the pool, yes no swim up bar, but it worked for us. The service was great and it was opened all day and night, good drinks, top shelf rum, vodka, tequila, scotch and whiskey were second tier, like JB and Jim Beam. The bear was great Dos Equis lager and amber and it was cold, we brought our own mugs so we would file them up before heading to the beach. I should note I have been coming to all inclusive for over 20 years in this area, so I know a couple of the tricks. The lobby bar was fun to sit around and play cards and watch or participate in the dance that started right after the show. It was a fun place. Did not have a bad drink while I was at the hotel, I do tip large at the beginning and tip at least a 1 dollar an order. The service was great, they made Washington apples for us as it is one of our favorite shots, they caught on and went from table to table serving them, again lots of fun. We went to Playa via walking the sidewalk out front, it took 15 minutes, a good walk. We shopped found what we wanted and took a cab ride back 50 pesos. I did change money in town to use. Also my wife saw a guy with a Coors Light walking around, of course her favorite beer, so I asked where he obtained as I have never seen it in Mexico, a little store had some, 115 pesos for a 6 pack, ouch. Food, each morning we went to the buffet after obtaining our location at the beach, it was a regular buffet with omelet/egg station, everything was good. Bacon was kept behind the omelet stations so you had to ask, no problem, just an observation. Service was good the coffee was strong, juice cold, etc. For lunch we ate at the snack bar located at the bar by the pool and also went to the buffet. The buffet had made to order hamburgers, be sure and have them cook the meet well done, my first try at the hamburger was raw, yuk. They also were grilling chicken, they also had ice cream for dessert, good and well made, especially the lime sherbet. Just a short note, pizza at the snack bar was good as well as the chips and guac. For dinner we ate at the Italian the first two nights, the first night was our try everything on the menu, by having each of us order something different. The second night was get what you like night, we must be the same, due to the fact we loved the appetizers, pasta courses, but not so much the main course, the main course was not seasoned enough for us, we love to eat and love some seasoning. The chicken main dish was the best. Deserts we had ice cream which was great, the wine was ok. My family other than I do not like wine like I do. The third night we went to the Viva Maya for dinner at the Portofino, from a 10 year ago previous stay at the Maya my hopes were up for a great dinner, but we had some issues. As we were seated another table was seated that must of been friends of the chef or manager, due to us sitting at our table for over 15 minutes with little to no service, the other table had 4 people waiting on them, with special appetizers being delivered, since we were a couple of tables away, I had to explain what was going on to my family. We went with what was going on and made the best of it. My sons tried a couple of new drinks since they had some higher end selections, one even had a Harvey wall banger, look it up, it was great. Again we liked the appetizers, and the pasta was great, the main course was not very good, I had the filet, did not even try to eat since I could not cut it, my wife had the salmon, not a good choice since it is not a fish from the area, we skipped desert since they did not have ice cream. The main chef came out to check with the vip table who finished 30 minutes before us. I saw him the next day at the Viva Azteca checking on the buffet, must of been friends of his. So double order the pasta especially at the Portofino, I had the seafood with shrimp and angle hair with a light tomato sauce, it was great. We stayed at the resort until time to leave about 2 pm, check out is 12, but we bumped it till 12:45 no problem. We stayed and ate at the buffet and drank beer before a cab the bell hop arranged for us to take to the airport, only 500 peso cheaper and faster than the bus. We did like the hotel, but would only enjoy it during the winter months, since the buffet does not have ac at all. Would we return, the answer is yes, but only during the cooler months. Any questions ask, I have been to many of the resorts in the area, with over 26 trips under my belt.

We had no problems with regards to service; our room was always spotless. Our maid Rosa did an amazing job. Everyday we had a different figure made from the towels. We tipped her each day. Buffet - as stated elsewhere food was basic, but good, and plentyful. There was always lots to eat. The Restaurants were all very good. I would say the Bamboo would be rated lowest on my list - the food was never hot; all the others were very good. Also went to the Mediteranean Restaurant at the Maya, and it was great - went there twice! You are allowed 3 reservations per week, but if you check with guest services at 2:45 they will let you book if there are openings for that same night. Great beach, cleaned each day, and yuo can walk for miles. It's only a 10 minute walk to Playa del Carmen on the beach. Nice clean pool, but cooler than the ocean, so we stayed there. Lots of chairs, and polapas to choose from We took the Albabtros Tour for snorkling, and had a great day. The sailing was wonderful. We had one bad experiance. - Our room had an adjoining room door. It meant we could hear all the noise from next door. Our neighbor ended up being a loud mouth drunk for most of the time he was there. Seems like the guy would sleep most of the day, then drink, and become louder with each drink. He was in & out all hours of the night, slamming doors, and yelling at his wife. He destroyed the TV, and also damaged the room. After they finally left, maintenance were in there till 11 pm doing repairs. We did complain to the desk, and they said others had also complained.

Went snorkeling through Olympus tours had an amazing time with them. Entertainment staff were AMAZING they were always trying to entertain and very friendly. All day long were fun activities such as dance lessons, aerobics, stepping classes, volleyball, soccer... Always something to do! The nightly shows were cute, not broadway but considering the resort, the price and the young staffing who were not hired for dancing abilities necessarily. Room was very nice, clean, large. Balcony was small with two chairs but very nice. Had a lot of tv channels in english. House keeping were very good. Nothing to complain about in the room. I really loved the size of the resort, it was not a huge resort, the pool was literally 20 feet from the entrance to our hotel building and the beach just beyond that. It was a very nice family friendly resort, had mostly europeans and south americans/mexicans staying there. Everyone was very friendly, met some very interesting people. The place had two bars, including the bar just by the lobby and one outside right by the pool. The grounds were very pretty, there were animals who lived there, very cute ones that looked like bunnies but more exotic. Only negative, one of the front desk staff members named Emin I believe, was extremely rude, had no customer service training it seemed at all. There was a young man who worked behind the desk too who was wonderful, very helpful and kind. We had some problems because we stayed there during the time hurricane rina was approaching mexico, but turned out to be a tropical storm when it got there. We were scared and worried about the storm. Emin was very rude during this stressful time, Will not go into details here. He was the only major negative.

We were supposed to stay at the Wyndham Maya, but when we arrived, they moved us to Azteca, telling us that it was a nicer property. We trusted them so agreed to be moved. Should have checked out the properties/rooms first! Maya MUCH nicer than Azteca. Luckily, both properties are within easy walking distance, so we were able to walk to Maya and spend more of our time there. Azteca had NO energy at all and Maya was full of life! People even seemed happier over there. Food: The food at both of these properties was mediocre at best, but we sort of expected that due to how much we were spending for an all inclusive. We didn't pay much. Not to sound snobby, but I consider this a budget property. It's not as nice as more expensive all-inclusives, but it's nice to not break the bank when vacationing! At Azteca, we were only allowed to make ONE dinner reservation (AKA eat at one of the restaurants) for our ENTIRE stay! They made an exception and let us have two meals in the restaurants, but otherwise, we had to eat the buffet. The selection is great at the buffet and it's nice to just walk in and eat when you want, it's just that the quality isn't good at all. Quality in restaurants not good either. Understand where I'm coming from, though...both of our husbands are excellent chefs (one professionally) so we get spoiled w/ food. Resort: The resort is somewhat cramped compared to Maya. (If you have a choice, choose Maya, not Azteca). While the property is pretty, it's not laid out as well as Maya, which has a beautiful and expansive pool area with excellent views of the beach. If you hang out at the pool here, you're more likely to stare at the buildings of the property than at the ocean. Staff: Overall, the staff is friendly. We did experience some attitude from a couple of the employees, but that can happen anywhere. When I had to return something I bought at the gift shop it was a challenge to get my money back. The sign stating \"NO RETURNS\" was facing the wrong direction when I made my purchase and no one mentioned the policy when I paid for my item. I had to get the assistant hotel mgr to help me out...and when we went into the gift shop to do the return transaction, the woman behind the counter had daggers in her eyes. She was NOT happy with me. I was polite throughout the process, but obviously, that didn't made a difference. Nice that the mgr was helpful. Room: Room was comfortable, but definitely outdated a bit. My mattress was firm and comfortable. The Maya property has renovated rooms, though. The air conditioning didn't get as cold as we would have liked, but it sufficed. Walls are paper thin! We heard our neighbors fighting one night (she kept saying the room smelled like mold and wanted to leave). Also, when housekeeping was doing their rounds staring first thing in the AM, we heard them outside our door. I'd definitely stay at the Maya if we go back. We did have a great time and even hit Coco Bongo, a club where there's also live shows. I recommend doing that if you like to party it up a bit, but it's expensive! On a day it was raining, we found an information place to ask questions re Coco Bongo and the person behind said we could get free tickets if we listened to a presentation on another property for a vacation club. Since it was raining, we figured, \"Why not? Save about $75/ticket!\" Got our tickets the next day (when we were told to pick them up). I will say that on the days it rained, the staff really made an effort to keep guest occupied - Bingo, Pictionary, etc...it was a nice touch. Stay at Maya, not Azteca!

The staff couldnt have been more hepful and the animation team deserve a 7* rating of their own as they were AMAZING! They knew us by name after only a couple of days, they worked tirelessly, were ALWAYS cheerful and their dancing would put West End dancers to shame.

The hygiene in the food and drinks areas was better than anything we expected with ALL the staff wearing hairnets and all catering staff constantly changing gloves. We didn't have any tummy problems at all, despite me taking a chemists shop of mediaction lol. The food was of an excellent standard and there was loads of it. We also went to the Bamboo and Il Plato al la carte restaurants and they were superb. The Mayan restaurant only reopened after the storms a couple of days before we were due to leave and sadly we couldn't get a booking. The pool and jacuzzi were clean with no broken tiles and the beach.......words cant describe how beautiful it is! White sands, which are kept clean and beautiful ocean. Just a warning as you wade out there is a small dip about 6 feet from the shore and then you walk onto a sandbank. This gives you a bit of a shock when you step into it so if you're taking children under 8 I would watch them. There was a mix of nationalities: German, Dutch, Italian, American and lots of French Canadians and it was a mix of families, couples of all ages and groups of 30 somethings but there was no rowdiness, 5th Avenue is a 70 peso taxi ride away bit you can walk it easily or hire bikes free of charge from the hotel during the day. We did the Tulum and Coba tour which we booked from the kiosk at the parade of shops outside the hotels. Excellent tour and excellent guide and much cheaper then the holiday reps offer. Also went to Xel Ha which was awesome. My husband did 7 dives with the dive shop at the hotel but because of the storms the water sadly wasn't very clear, however he went on 2 cenote dives and was amazed by them.

(I had just been to the Viva Fourtuna in the Bahamas two weeks prior but had to leave early due to Hurricane Irene. Mexico was 'Stage Two' of my adventure.) I did this one on my own, and when booking, I had the choice between the Azteca and the Maya, sister hotels located a very short walk from one another. In retrospect, Azteca was certainly the right choice! Simply speaking, both facilities are fine, but Azteca seemed to be better kept and more relaxing. It costs a bit more, but it is worth it. The crowd is not as rambuncious and the tone a bit more sophisticated. The beach is also larger and less crowded. Service was great and, being the smaller facility, the staff got to know you quickly. I always wonder what kind of people they are who write that the staff was bad, or rude, or whatever - I found everyone working at Azteca to be friendly, attentive and concerned with your happiness! I felt like an honored guest, not an intruder in any fashion. Also important to know...Azteca guests have full access to the Maya (including specialty restaurants), and that does not go both ways. Both facilities have a few shops to take care of immediate needs. And so here are some bullet notes... *Food: I was impressed with the main dining room. It was comfortable and airy, the hours were generous and the food was better than expected. Yes, there are some Mexican dishes, but there is also something there for everyone. While using the standard buffet style, the carving stations offered some nice options and I never found myself wanting. There are two specialty restaurants, but the Oriental \"Bambu\" was closed while I was there. Given that I had full access to the resautants at the Maya, this was of no big concern. More importantly, the Italian restaurant at Azteca was amazing! I mean, amazing! The food was phenominal and all dishes were displayed in a fashion which made you feel as though you were eating in a five-star restaurant. Remember, I was solo on this trip, but was still treated like a king. Likewise, the atmosphere was romantic and enchanting...wonderful throughout. Poolside, if your schedule somehow fell out of wack, food was available at any time. I ate well enough in normal hours so I did not nibble often, but the choices available were abundant, not simply the hot dogs you see in some places. All together...very nice dining experience. *Beach & Pool: The beach was wonderful. Larger than that at the Maya, the water was heavenly and there was plenty of room for optional activities such as volleyball. I had heard that it was difficult finding lounges and the like, but being slightly off-season I encountered no such problems. All non-motor equipment is easily aquired just on the left side of the beach. Motorized comes with a price, but also offered with a smile. The pool looked relaxing as well and I can't believe I never got into it! I guess I was just having too much fun elsewhere! Towels are easy to get, but don't forget to return them! I brough my own, which always seems to make thing easier...also allows me to dive into the ocean even when the towel-shack is closed. Of course, you can always bring a towel from your room. *Rooms: What you see in the brochures is what you get. Mine was with no problems and the maid-service was right on the ball, niether pushy nor lazy. The bed was a bit harder than what I am used to, but barely enough to mention. (I also always bring my own pillow, which is not a bad idea if you like the softer touch.) The room was clean, the large TV worked great and the bathroom was well equiped and spacious...good water flow. And I love it when they give you those towels made up like animals each day! My room had a patio which did not show much, but it was nice to sit out there after a long swim. It's an easy walk to anywhere and they do a pretty good job of keeping the in-room fridge stocked each day. If you find your fridge not-stocked the first day, don't be surprised...turn-over is tough in terms of the schedule of any hotel and occasionally involves double stocking...either ask someone from the staff or be certain that things will be running smootly by day two. *Playa del Carmen: This is a great little city. Azteca is located in Playacar, one of the safest places in Mexico...it is a large gated town with high scale resorts and housing. Playa del Carmen is located about a fifteen minute walk and is a hoot. The first day I got a bike from Azteca (free) and peddled my way there. Not a good idea. Old bike, and aside from getting lost for a while, Carmen is a walking town...the main attraction a long street of shops that offer an array of merchandise. Easy to shop for your friends or family! There are some great restaurants and the feeling is festive. I went there three times and loved the adventure of it. While you can take a five minute cab ride for very little, if you decide to walk there use either the path which leads you right into it or use the beach, which I enjoyed more. Of course, if you know what you are looking for, great, but like many other locales, many of the shop owners want your business and will try (very hard) to get you to visit. And once they have you...it is hard to get away. Whatever they tell you the price is, offer half and work from there. There are a few larger (almost retail) shops that sell to tourists which will give you no problems at all, and the prices may be actually cheaper without the need to bargain...they have solid prices listed. No matter what, stop for a drink and take a great stroll...good fun, good food and good shopping. And everyone takes American dollars. *Security: While the flight to Cancun was easy, the line at Customs was long. Thats alright...but don't plan on breezing through. Much easier getting out of Mexico. Once out of the airport, don't be surprised when you get to the first \"Check Point.\" You will see several soldiers wearing UK37s, or whatever they are called, and this is not uncommon. Given the drug wars there, security has been extended. Still, I never felt worried at all, even when I went into del Carem the first day. There were dozens upon dozens of troops there wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying their fire-arms, at just about every corner. I'm not sure weather this made me feel more secure or afraid. Of course, the next day I went there, hoping to take some pictures, you could not find any of the troops. Must have been a sweep. Who knows. Either way, Playa del Carmen is a great way to spend an afternoon or an evening! Oh, and by the way, there is a small and nice Shopping Center just to the left of the enterance (between Azteca and Maya) if you want to pick up something quickly. Bit more expensive, but nice to have. *Tours: I was only there for five days and only took one tour, but I loved it! I booked from the front desk, though if you wish to save a few pesos, many of these tours are available on the first street as you enter Playa del Carmen and for reasonably reduced prices. There are also tours there which you may not find in the Hotel. If you deal with one of the tour operators on the street, offer less (up to 50% of what they are offering) and you might get it. My tour involved snorkeling with the turtles (with sting-rays and barricuda and other beautiful fish) followed by the caves, in which you can swim! Very cool! I forget the name of the tour guide, but she was a gem. There were a couple other tours I would have taken, but I was there for only a short time. The Mayan Ruins tours, though not really my thing, looked great. I suggest you get one that has multiple activities. It will take a full day, but you save some money and get the best of all. Cozumel is also a fantastic way to spend the day! More about that... *Snorkeling: I love to snorkel, and have had a great time doing so at Viva Resorts elsewhere, but at Azteca there is not much to see. If anything. If you bring your gear, walk about ten minutes left of the resort. The water has to be calm, but there is just enough to keep your interest up. If you really want a good experience, you may want to catch the ferry over to Cozumel, or take a tour that will take you there. I did not have the chance to do this, but will do so in the future. The ferry leaves right out of Playa del Carmen and you can get some cheap more personaized snorkeling options from the street mentioned above. *Entertainment: I only went to one show, which was fine and would have been more fun if I was with someone else. Azteca offers shows every night, apparently all based upon Broadway shows. Being a smaller venue, that made it more interesting. Maya offered more options, but I never wandered in that direction. From what I saw, you won't be awed, but a nice way to relax at the end of the day. *Drinking & Internet: OK, strange combination, but one of the two bars is an Internet hotspot. Kind of. First off, my room, as most are, is only a minute away from that bar. For those of us who like a beer from time to time, this made it easy to wander from my room and get refreshed. Bring a larger cup or a something along those lines to keep yourself supplied. Dependant upon where you are in Azteca, you may or may not get sporadic Internet service. You will get a reasonable signal at the 'in-hotel' bar, but you may have to go to the Lobby, where the signal is strong and more than acceptable. Whatever you do, as is often seen here, tip the bartenders. The first day. No, you don't have to tip them all the time, but they really appreciate the effort and will reward you with good service and go out of there way to make you a special guest. After day one I don't think I actually had to order a beer...they just knew what I wanted, when I wanted it and were ready before I even got to the bar. *Transportation: Before I got to Mexico I booked a car to get from the Airport to Azteca. It cost $110 round trip and it was worth it. Even by myself (and would have cost the same for two), they were there and great and I had no worries. You can probably get something less...I don't know...but it was a pleasure to be treated special for a 45-1 hour trip. This was a quick but really nice trip. I look forward to doing it again next year, with goals to spend more time, explore with more enthusiasm and have some extra time to enjoy the great hospitality I received. Even sitting alone by the buffet, one of the entertainment employees joined me...not selling anything, just spending some time sharing stories and to learn from each other's experiences. I liked Azteca. A lot.

I read the reviews on this hotel before booking, and with all reviews you never really know what to believe. Please take my review as a very accurate depiction of this wonderful hotel. Beach: BEAUTIFUL! Clean turquoise water, white powder sand beaches. The water was very refreshing & you were able to swim out approx. 20 meters & still able to see the bottom. Small white angel fish were a nice friendly surprise (feed them hot dog buns & they will feed right around you. Non harmful, kid friendly). Super fun! Lifeguard on duty. Not very choppy waters at all. Always able to find a beach chair - we didn't have to wake up at 6am to reserve a spot which was great. Although we visited during a down time, which I highly recommend. Perfect! Hotel: A smaller resort (which is nice if you are looking for more of a peaceful vacation). All age groups, couples, family & kid friendly. They offer a kids play area & babysitting! Short walk to the beach & pool area. Everything is within a short walking distance. Not too large like some other hotels where you have to take a shuttle to the beach! Clean rooms, with free safe & our mini bar was stocked every day for free (water & pop). No insects, no problems with the room. Air conditioning worked perfectly! Great water pressure in the shower. If you are looking for a 5+ star room, you won't find that here but you rarely spend anytime in your room anyways. The essentials are available & we were very happy with our room. No complaints. We stayed in room 2335. Hotel grounds were beautifully groomed & always kept clean. Food: Buffet offered a wide variety of food & themes changed every night (Mexican, Italian, Seafood). We were able to reserve 3 al la carte restaurants which were delicious! We ate at the Italian, Mexican, & Mayan restaurants. Great food & amazing service! Restaurants very nicely decorated & clean. We never got sick. Filtered water is always available. The 24 hr pool bar was great as well. Always offering drinks & snacks (hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, nachos, pizza, rice, pasta, etc.) There is something for everyone! You are also able to use the services/restaurants at the Viva Wyndham Maya resort as well which is 3 or 4 hotels down the strip. This is a much larger resort but they have a smaller beach area. Staff: PHENOMENAL!!! The hotel staff was very friendly & accommodating. Check in was quick & our room was ready by 3pm. Check out time is 12pm. We received a delicious welcome drink upon arrival. The entertainment/sports staff were all very friendly & extremely hard working, pulling 13 hour days. I can not say enough how wonderful they are!!! They make it a point to mingle with guests & learn your name. There is a different entertainment show every night at 930pm which is definitely entertaining and wonderful! (Latin, hollywood, impersonations, etc.) A must see! They also offer free catamaran lessons & windsurfing. Special thank you to Enzo & Daniel! There is also jet skiing on the beach for an additional cost ($55 for 1/2hr) - so much fun! I would highly recommend this resort. Great quality & great value. Most beautiful beaches & hardworking staff that I have ever encountered. There is also lots to see & do in the area. Daily excursions, swimming with dolphins, horseback riding, Mayan temples, etc. You can also walk 15 mins to Playa Del Carmen for some shopping - very nice cobblestone shopping area.

The food was frequently cold, old and confusing. The bar is called a deli but they rotate old food from the buffet to the bar area. The burgers and hot dogs are poor quality and go straight in the trash. Confusing? The food is set out and you have to hunt down the parts and pieces. If you find a hamburger you have to hunt for the bun, then where is the cheese? No condiments or mustard tonight? If you find some pasta where is the sauce and parmessian cheese. Taco and enchilada never found. Do not expect Texas quality mexican food or tex-mex. The queso is a power based tasteless watery paste. One night I went to the deli hoping for a sandwich but found 4 types of potato recycled from the dinner buffet, old pizza (pizza was good hot). They even killed the french fries. Do not expect a piece of swiss cheese and ham for a sandwich or even a tomato and mozzarella. Wonton soup with no wonton. And lastly, they hide the bacon from you so you have to ask for it.

This was probably my 6th trip to this side of Mexico, all others with my husband. I selected the Viva Azteca as it was a smaller hotel and it went on sale for a decent price. The summary of our trip impressions follows: Pros: - Unlike the mammoth resorts where you forget how to find your building, let alone your room, this resort is logically laid out with reception at the front and two buildings running the length of the property down to the pool and ocean. - I am not a buffet fan but I must admit their food at the buffet was very good. As usual they had a speciality every night and we ate the nights they had Oriental, Tropical (fish), Italian and International. - The ala carte restaurants, especially the Italian at the Azetca, were very good. - Liked the idea that you could make reservations for the restaurants at the Wyndham Maya from the Azteca desk. - Wonderful courtyard area that you could eat your meals from the buffet or sit on the other side and enjoy drinks from the lobby bar. - Dark and light beer (Dos XX) on tap. - Self-serve soda and juices. - Loved at the Europeans. I understand it is due to the time of year (September). North Americans dominate in the winter. - Easy cab ride to Playa del Carmen. - Huge animation crew that did a good job of the 2 nightly shows we saw. - Pool bar open 24 hours so you could go down near the ocean in the late evening and have a drink and feel the ocean breeze. Cons: - Only 3 reservations per week, even though they weren't that busy. The reservation desk did say that if you came at 2:50, 10 minutes before reservations closed, and they had an opening for that night you could make one. We didn't bother. - Beach is very difficult to walk as the sand is very soft and there is quite a drop to the water. No hard packed, water logged sand to walk on. The 10 minute walk to the Maya was very difficult in the heat. We took the street back. - Balconies off the rooms are useless as they are not wide enought to even get a chair on. Main floor rooms had a patio with 2 chairs and table no view of course. - Small pool with no swin-up bar.

We totally enjoyed our vacation, and feel we got a good value for our money. Accommodations and Food The rooms were clean, comfortable, and spacious. There was plenty of storage areas for our personal belongings. The beds were comfortable but the pillows were too hard. Most rooms don\u2019t have much of a balcony, they have a French balcony with standing room only. We were on the ground floor so we had a small table with chairs outside of our patio door. Overall the hotel and grounds are very attractive and well-maintained. The beach is absolutely beautiful\u2026..clear turquoise water and soft white sand. It turned out that we spent most of our time near the pool area because that\u2019s where the activities occur. Toward the end we spent more time at the beach and ocean, wishing we had done it sooner because the ocean water is cooler than the pool water and much more refreshing. There were surprisingly few Americans at this resort. For some reason it seems to be more popular with guests from Holland and Germany. Almost everyone spoke English, were friendly and interesting and fun. We made many new friends. The pool bar is open 24 hours, so you can get drinks or food any time of the day or night. They have self-serve soda machines which was convenient. The pool bar also serves a snack buffet including the best pizza. In our opinion, the only shortcoming of this resort was the food at the main buffet. It wasn\u2019t that good. Not terrible, just not good. Maybe it was because they had so many hot meaty dishes and hot vegetable dishes. In the heat of July, hot dishes were not very appealing to us. They did have a small salad bar, and small selection of fresh fruit, but not much cold foods such as sandwiches or cold salads or even breads. We always managed to find something to eat, but the food was definitely not the highlight of our vacation. Fortunately the dining experience isn\u2019t important to us, we just loved the convenience of popping into the buffet for a quick meal, then moving on to other more interesting activities. We never tried either of the restaurants, so can\u2019t comment on that. Activities I give Viva Wyndham Azteca an extremely high rating in the activities category. There are many things to do at the hotel, also many things to do that are nearby the hotel. Every day comes with an activities schedule, and a very enthusiastic and energetic Animation Team (similar to activities coordinators). We enjoyed water aerobics, salsa lessons, beach volleyball, Spanish lessons, step aerobics, various games, etc. The evening shows were pretty good, but the theater was hot and stuffy. After the show there is not much nightlife. The main bar is open until midnight, with music and dancing on a makeshift dance floor (the adjacent outdoor corridor to the main bar). The hotel provides bicycles at no extra cost, you simply check them out. It\u2019s a short 10-minute ride into Playa del Carmen for shopping, restaurants, and even the ferry to Cozumel. Or to walk takes about 20 minutes. As a guest of Viva Azteca, you also have full access to their sister resort, the Viva Maya which is about a 5 minute walk down the street. The Viva Maya has a few extra activities such as archery and trapeze. It also has a disco. We did visit the Viva Maya, once by day and once by night. During the day, it is larger and much more crowded than the Azteca, so we didn\u2019t stick around. At night, we went to the disco. That particular evening the disco was empty, so we didn\u2019t stick around either. But it\u2019s nice that we had two resorts for the price of one. I highly recommend a nearby nightclub called Coco Bongo. It is an experience like no other, best described as a combination of Las Vegas show and New Year\u2019s Eve party. It was crazy good! We stayed until 4am (and we are in our 40\u2019s). It was convenient that we could make all the arrangements through our hotel. We purchased a wristband (for admission and open bar) for $55 each, and it included transportation to the nightclub. Seems pricey but it was well worth it!! The return trip was a $6 cab ride that took 10 minutes. Transportation We booked our transfer to/from the hotel with USA Transfers, based on a recommendation from other Tripadvisor members, and were very pleased with the service. We made the reservation online, in advance. The round-trip cost is $100 which we paid to the driver. Upon our arrival at the Cancun International Airport, it was easy to find the greeter with the \u201cUSA Transfers\u201d sign, and for our departure the driver arrived at the hotel promptly at our 7am departure time. The vehicle was clean, the driver very professional and courteous, and we felt very safe.

This past winter my boyfriend and I (I am 32 he is 35) stayed here and had an absolutely wonderful time! Is this hotel a 5 star Ritz Carlton...no. Is the food gourmet.....no. Does it have a gorgeous beach, friendly staff and plenty of tastey drinks to try...YES! We ate at the buffet every night except for one night when we tried the Italian restaurant. The Italian restaurant was pretty bad, we both ordered a filet mignon which was more like a very small piece of overcooked potroast, but were we about to let that ruin our vacation, absolutely not! We laughed it off...I mean it's all inclusive so you can go grab something else to eat if you didn't like your dinner. We ate a lot of pizza and pasta, and I ate about my weight in guacamole while I was there - it was delicious! The bartenders are fabulous! They remember what you like to drink and always (with the exception of one guy) had a smile and a laugh for you! We went into Playa center a couple of nights and actually had an amazing steak dinner our last night downtown, I wish I could remember the name of the restaurant. Viva Azteca is in a great location to go on tours, we did Goralax, ATV, ziplining and cenotes tour which was great fun! Definitely recommend that tour! If you are the type of traveler who is going to be bothered by things like a couple of ants in your room, if you are looking to be pampered and waited on hand and foot, or if you want a hotel room that looks like one in vegas - don't come here! Hello - it's Mexico and it's a pretty cheap vacation considering it's all inclusive. If you are laid back, love the beach and relaxing then this might be the place for you! The only thing I truly felt was lacking was a beach bar! Would be great to have a bar right there on the beach - but guess walking to the pool bar a burned off a couple of the calories from the drinks anyways!", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cloved it loved it loved it!!!\u201d", "Author": "Anechka007", "ReviewID": "UR116171553", "Content": "we were visiting VWA in June - me and my 7 years old son.

We had an amazing time!!! Location: There is a small shopping district 3-4 blocks to the left of the entrance, and a big shopping district (Playa del Carmen) about 1 mile right of the entrance. Both are extremely safe and offer lots of shopping!!! Playa del Carmen has a Senor Frogs and a Carlos & Charlies, too! Initially, I was nervous to travel to Mexico...but by the end of the week, we were biking all over without any worries! Food: Book early in the week to reserve your dining spots at Il Palco (my favorite), Bamboo and/or Xul-Ha. A tip goes a long way towards helping you to secure those reservations. Dinner was excellent at all three, but my family's preferences were #1- Il Palco, #2 - Bamboo and #3 - Xul-Ha. The buffet is very good, but by the end of the week...we were ready for a change. The theme changes nightly, but the variation in food is minimal. For buffet food, though, it was good enough for us! Excursions: We went to Xplor and Tulum/Xel-ha. Xplor and Xel-ha were AMAZING! There are just not enough words to describe the awesome experiences we had at both. Tulum had lots of shopping, a Mayan performance (the performers expect a monetary contribution), tons of iguanas, a quick dip in the Caribbean and fascinating ruins. But Xplor and Xel-ha offered much more exhilarating options. The ziplining at Xplor was INTENSE. Prepare to walk uphil for about two hours...exhausting but worth every step!!! The snorkeling at Xel-ha was incredible! Both are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! Azteca may not be the most upscale resort in Playacar, but it was perfect for my family. We visited the sister hotel (the Maya), and the energy level was much more intense. We preferred the laid back atmosphere of the Azteca, but my kids LOVED the swim-up pool bar at the Maya. There is a trapeze and archery for kids at the Maya, too. Neither one impressed my kids. Overall, I would definitely return to the Azteca.

This hotel was a great place to stay and Playa del Carmen/Rivieria Maya has beautiful beaches. We were very sad when our vacation came to an end, and are planning a trip back as soon as we can! We vacationed here July 17-24, 2011. I have been to Cancun previously, but never to Playa del Carmen/Rivieria Maya. The hotel was farely crowded, but we never had a problem getting chairs on the beach/pool. Weather: The weather is perfect, hot and sunny. It did rain one night, very briefly. It was very humid at night, especially at the bar after the show where you can't feel much of the breeze. Hotel: Overall is a great resort. The grounds were kept well, everything was clean and beautiful. It is a mix of couples, families, and groups of friends. We met alot of great people, especially the staff. Rooms: We stayed in the standard rooms. They were very clean, decorated nicely, and a nice size. The air-conditioning works well and keeps rooms really cool. The rooms had closets for hanging clothes and shelves, plenty of room for your clothes. Each room has a safe. The bathrooms were nice also. The shower and toilet were in one room, while the duel sinks were outside...lots of mirror space too. You spend VERY LITTLE time in your room, so although they were not luxurious, they were spacious and clean...which is all that really matters. Internet: They have a buisness center where you can access computers for a charge. Also, there is free wifi all over the hotel grounds and in rooms. I accessed the WiFi from my iPhone and had good connectivity. Resturant - The main resturant was buffet style with many choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It is open-air seating, and also outside seating. The food was ok, and they had a large variety at each mean. Every night for dinner was a theme(Mexican, Asian, Italian, etc) Staff sometimes sat with us, which we enjoyed getting to know them. There are also 3 other resturants, by reservation only. We tried the italian, the food was ok, but the service was poor. I recommend sticking to the buffet. There is also a 24-hr snack bar by the pool which offers fruit, nachos, burgers, fries, etc Bar - There are 3 bars; One by the pool, the main bar, and the sports bar. The main bar is where we spent most of our nights after the shows. There was a DJ and everyone danced and had a great time. After the shows, the staff comes to the bar to dance and mingle with the guests. He played alot of popular \"club\" songs for dancing, but also played music according to the Show themes. The DJ is done at 12pm, then we would go out to the pool bar to hang out, which ended up being a lot of fun. Shows - There are shows put on by the Staff every night. I must say, of all the places I have been, these were the best shows I have seen by a resort staff. Mossimo is VERY entertaining, he is funny and can take on any character. He is an absolute trip! I also have to say the men in the shows were EXCELLENT dancers and really outshined the females in the show! The stand-outs for excellent dancers are Dodo, Alberto, Enzo, Edgar, Guillermo(spelling?), Piero, & Eduardo! Cabaret was one of the funniest shows! I highly recommend seeing the shows every night. Piero did an amazing job talking on the mike as well. Pool/Beach: The pool is a nice size. The water is boiling hot so we spent most of our time at the beach. There were games & activities at the pool for adults and kids; volleyball, water polo, dancing lessons, races, etc). The pool/beach chairs were nice. There were shaded areas for people who did not want to be in the sun. Towels are provided. The beach is BEAUTIFUL and the water is a very nice temp. A couple days there was some seaweed or algas, but they cleaned it up quickly. We bought rafts to float in the ocean, which was great, except we ended up about 5 hotels down, so watch the current haha Sports: There are all kinds of things to keep you busy here. There are Kayaks, you can wind-suf(lessons available), and sail on a catamaran. We did the catamaran everyday and it was awesome! Ezno took us out almost every day, and he was a blast. He did a great job sailing, and also very good getting to know him. Alberto also did an awesome job with the water sports, he was always busting his butt to help out everyone. Staff: The staff was excellent. They were all very informative, friendly, and lots of fun. We really got to know quite a few of them, they were very personable, funny, and made our trip that much more enjoyable, and absolutely unforgettable. They were always dancing at the bar, trying to get people involved in activites during the day, and awesome to hang out with. Piero - Great personality, very friendly, and such an adorable sweetheart! Did a great job announcing and really good in the shows. Enzo - Very outgoing, personable, and lots of fun! He is excellent at sailing and really good in the shows. Mossimo - One of a kind! He is so entertaining in the shows, and around the resort. You can tell he loves his job and loves people! Eduardo - BEST Personality!!! He was so outgoing, loved to dance and have fun. Fernando - Really outgoing, lots of fun, and a great dancer! Alberto - Excellent dancer and lots of fun! He did a great job with the kayaks, catamarans and entertaining people. He had a great personality...just adorable. The Viva Wyndham should be thankful and feel very lucky to have these great people working for their resort. Each of them made our vacation lots of fun, and we really enjoyed our week getting to know them. Thanks to all of them for making our trip so unforgetable! Overall: Loved the Viva Wyndham Azteca. My friend and I were very sad to leave and can not wait to go back. The beach and water is gorgeous....crystal clear turqoise blue water and white sand. The resort was a perfect atmosphere for myself and my friend. We met alot of great people that we will remain friends with for a long time.

My goal was to find a location that had a beautiful white sand beach, close proximity to 5th Avenue, at a cheap price. A pool is a pool in my mind, living in TX I just want gorgeous beaches. We booked from 6/13-6/18 on cheapcarribean.com, we overall enjoyed our stay. With that being said, here are my reviews on: RESORT/ROOMS- Nice small quaint resort, I requested a room with a beach view (when booking online) and luckily landed room 2304, which had a perfect view of both the beach and the pool area. The room and bathroom were basic, with only soap dispensers provided. I did not expect a 5 star resort amenity, you shouldn't either. There is no A/C in the whole resort except for your room and the specialty eateries, so it did get fairly humid eating in the buffet. Bring mosquito spray, I got bit about 7 times from the main lobby area and my room (due to opening the windows). BEACH/POOL-Beautiful white sand, clear warm water. Everything I expected and more. Because we were early risers (and we had a view of the beach chair situation from our room haha), we were able to get shaded cabanas everyday. In sum, towels are given out at 7am. By 8am: most of the pool areas with shade are taken with towels, as were the prime beach locations. When I say \"prime\" I mean 2 seats with an umbrella, that are seperated from the rows and rows of chairs. We didn't wanna lie right next to others with our arms touching. By 930am all/most chairs are taken. The pool is smaller than other resorts, half of it gets taken for activities between 11am and 1pm. The pool bar is great though, they have middle of the line liquor such as cuervo gold, smirnoff, absolut, and some nice tequillas. They will make it as strong as you want, just tip them nice. I usually gave $100 pesos in the beginning of the day, and made sure the bartenders were gonna be there all day. They loved us, and took care of us well haha. FOOD- The buffett is what you would expect. Granted you get tired of the breakfast, but what else is there to eat? You have all the typical foods (eggs, sausage, pancakes), they have an omellete station, a crepe station, 10 types of juices and yogurts, and chilquilies which I liked. We ate at 2 restaurants, but... LISTEN TO WHAT I AM SAYING! We are big foodies with a diverse international palate, yet we set our expectations correctly. The Italian restaurant was actually pretty good, got Caesar Salad and carpaccio (lacked seasoning.) Canneloni and Salmon were good. Overall I give it an 8/10. The Asian restaurant was horrible!! Granted, we both know authentic Asian food vs Mall Asian Food. But this was worse than mall \"americanized lemon chicken-type\" of food. The sushi literally made me gag, and I spit it out. Fish is not fresh, but the worse is the wasabi!!! I swear on everything, it was made out of play-doh. It had not once tinge of spice/menthol taste that Wasabi has. Don't order the sushi or Chow Mein either. Chow Mein was essentially sweet and sour noodles. No asian taste, just a sweet red sauce all over the food. OVERALL- Besides the Asian restaurant, everything was a great deal!! If you are not looking for a glamorous 5 star limo resort this is worth it.

I always find that confusing if you are trying to figure out exactly how far you are from activities outside the resort. P.D.C. is only a 15 min walk or $7 taxi away though! I was looking for an A.I. resort, small & intimate, since it was only my husband & I on this trip. He likes to sleep in & I like to be easy for him to find when he wakes!! lol That being said, Viva Azteca was perfect!! The price we booked was awesome. We booked \"private\" transfers from the airport on USA Transfers for $109 round trip & that was definetly worth it!! No stops at other resorts, arriving a lot earlier to our resort, especially since it was down in the riviera!! Check in was a breeze. Rooms were just o.k., but clean. The beds were very comfortable to me. The furniture lacked drawers which was kind of a hinderance & the bathroom lacked toiletries other than soap dispensers & hair dryer, but, that is not a \"biggie\" to me. There is always something to eat & drink. Food in the buffets was decent. We made reservations at the Bamboo, which if you like Oriental, it was great!! I would say it was the best meal we had at the resort!! We also went to Xul-Ha restaurant. It was very romantic, great food & soothing mayan music!! It is not Mexican food. I always have trouble in the caribbean finding ice tea & they had tea & juice dispensers everywhere making it very convenient & refreshing after plenty of drinking! ha Plenty of liquor!! The activities were a little lacking, but, we made friends with some of the entertainment staff & they were very friendly and interesting. The shows at night were typical. But, we went into Playa del Carmen several nights & went to the Viva Maya one night for their show. Maya is a lot larger with a bigger stage, but, it all seemed a little more generic, so we were happy we spent the few extra dollars & stayed at the Azteca. There were lots of Europeans, with few people from the states & Canada, so the majority of conversations I heard were German, but, that was o.k., too! The beach was awesome & they had plenty of chairs!! Overall, we were looking for a nice clean place, easy to maneuver (not a mega resort) with some activities & decent food & this place fit the bill!!

We traveled with another couple and were both given 3rd floor rooms fairly close to each other. ROOMS: Our room, 1306, had a pool view with a decent ocean view if you stood on the small balcony. The room was large and comfortable, and the shower was warm with good water pressure. The beds are firm, so if you don't like that you should ask Guest Services for a mattress topper. There is a flat screen tv, alarm clock, hair dryer, safe, and minifridge with water and soda. Being next to the pool and the 24hr pool bar, we did here some late night partiers on a few nights, this was not great, but, hey, they are on vacation too. We did notice an odor outside our room which appeared to be coming from the hotel next door, but this was intermittent and did not effect our stay. FOOD: The buffet has a variety of food, and had different themes each night. If you are not super picky you should find something you like. To be honest, it was just okay for my taste. The Pool Bar had plenty of food all day, thin crust pizza, pasta, rice, hot dogs, etc. (chips, salsa and guacamole, were awesome) We usually had snacks at the pool bar in the afternoon. We also visited the Viva Maya for their lunch buffet one day and had great service, and a decent lunch. We ate at 3 ala carte restaurants: Italian at the Azteca was ok, a bit salty for my taste, Mexican at the Viva Maya was real good, and the Mediterranean at the Viva Maya was excellent. There are 2 bars: the lobby bar is nice, large, open air, and opens to the central patio. The pool bar has great drinks and service, and AWESOME coffee each morning. There was a sports bar, but I did not see the \"bar\" open at all, you could watch sports and play pool though. BEACH: What can I say, it is beautiful! The water was warm and refreshing, but the waves were pretty big with an undertow the week we stayed, so we did not do any water activities. We were on the beach ALL DAY, every day. I am an early bird on vacation, so I was up and on the beach early enough to find a decent spot with some shade. The best spots do fill up by 8am, but there is no lack of chairs. POOL: This could use some fun. The pool is not the largest and it is shared by kids, adults, and activities. We had to stop our water volleyball game for activities on one occasion, and on another we were told we could not have our drinks in the pool. That bothered me. I am on vacation and enjoy cooling off in the pool with a cervesa. So if you are looking for a lively pool with music, drinks and fun...then visit the Maya, we had a blast there one afternoon. NOTE The pool area is very slippery, so be careful. ACTIVITY: If joining activities is your thing, there is no lack of opportunity. The activity staff is plentiful and are always out and about trying to get people involved. We were there mostly for relaxation and did get a bit bothered when a third \"no thank you\" did not get them to move along. They have nightly shows at both hotels and a disco at the Viva Maya. We did not visit these, so I cannot review them. ALL IN ALL, we had a great week. I prefer a small moderate hotel with great service, and I feel we got all that and more. This hotel is listed as a 3-4 star hotel on most of the web sites and I would give it 4 stars. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing beach vacation in Playacar on a budget. I would recommend the Viva Maya if you want a more lively hotel atmosphere. IF I could have changed one thing...I would have liked a small bar on the beach. Trekking through the slippery pool area to get a drink was a bit of a chore. So a small beach bar would be a welcomed addition to this great little hotel for us beach lovers.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "central maine", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel I have ever stayed in at south ouf Cancun!!!!\u201d", "Author": "zeldasdad", "ReviewID": "UR109192429", "Content": "I had seperate reservations made through 2 different sources.The first was for 4 days and the other for 5 days.The day i arrived I was told there were no reservations available at any of the ala carte dining rooms.

The second day was mostly spent trying to make 2 telephone calls.walking back ond forth lobby to room again and again.Most hotels ask for a credit card when you check in.this resort requires a $50 or $100 credit card charge which is processed if the phone is used.calls to U.S. are either $4 or $5 a minute. when i returned to my room i tried make a local call,.kept getting a message in Spanish.Went to front desk and they sent a bell boy who couldn't speek English to help me.He couldn't get through.Back to front desk .They finally noticed that they forgot to activate my room phone.these problems continued,so i finally made guest services place my calls from the lobby. The ala carte restaurants were better than the buffet ,but far below any others that i have stayed at. The pool is the smallest I have seen at any resort on the Riviera Maya Outside my room there was an odor which smelled like sewerage. I contacted my agent for my second reservation and was able to cancel the last 5 days an got reservations at another near by resort.(at an additional cost of $340). The few good points I found : The Italian girl at reception and the check out clerk were very helpful. The resort has a verry nice beach. It is within walking distance of Playa del Carmen. Let me stress that I am not a novice traveller.I have been travellin to the Yucatan since 1983.I have stayed at many different resorts .In the last 6 years I have probably spent 40 weeks on the riviera,and must say this resort would get my lowest rating. do not waste your time and money.

The resort is located in the gated community of Playacar, alongside many other resorts, private housing, golf club, small shopping mall and within 20 minutes stroll to Playa del Carmen town (or $7 taxi). This resort provided great value for the money paid - if you're looking for marble and chandeliers, you wont find them here. It was, however, nicely landscaped, clean, with comfortable rooms, adequate bathrooms, good food and drink, friendly, efficient staff and a fun entertainment programme. Plus, being a small resort, everything was within a short walk. We were pleasantly surprised to be allocated a room in building 2 (2317) with a view overlooking the pool and the ocean in the distance; a nice, bright room. Most rooms only have \"juliette\" balconies - can stand outside, but no room for table and chairs. Bed IMO wasn't too bad compared to some I've encountered! Our mini-fridge only had water and soft drinks - I inquired at guest relations and was told no beer (maybe upgraded ocean-front rooms only?). However, I asked our housekeeper for extra water each day and diet sodas and they were provided. I tipped every day - left the money under the pillow. Our housekeeper did a great job (including the requisite \"towel art\"!) We discovered that our fridge didnt work - it was changed the next day; also, the screen door was off the runners - maintenance was there in 15 mins to repair. The bathroom only has one sink, but a very large counter area with a wooden bar running under it (great for drying swimsuits - there's also a line in the bath that retracts).....I also used the luggage rack on the balcony to help dry off clothes - it can't be seen from the ground. There are two drawers in the cabinet above the fridge and ours got very warm....so used to put stuff in there too, to help it dry out......There's no air-conditioning in the public areas (main buffet, lobby, bar, theatre etc) and even a short stroll for breakfast meant damp clothing! Two of the a la carte restaurants are air-conditioned; the third is set on a patio outside - however, all areas have fans in the ceiling circulating air and it was quite breezy most of the time. We all thought that for the most part, the food was very good with a reasonable selection. In fact, we thought that the food in the a la cartes was better than some of the \"higher-end\" resorts we've been to - however, only allowed 3 dinners there - no biggie, as the buffet was more than acceptable. The pool bar provided food basically 24 hrs and we always had lunch there - overlooking the sea with a breeze...aaaah! They always had some hot dishes of chicken, fish, french fries etc, plus a small salad bar, thin crust pizza cooked there and then, plus the usual burgers and a dessert for after.....Both the lobby and pool bars had espresso machines and the capuchinos (made by the barmen) were great! \"Better\" quality liquor is available (the bottles are on display e.g. Absolute, Bacardi, Smirnoff, Jose Cuervo and my fav Havana Club:):) ...just ask and the bartenders will make you what you want; no decent Scotch, but at the price paid, we bought our own in Playa. I didn't like the wine - but bought my own too. The beach in front of the hotel is very deep, with plenty of loungers (VERY close together) and shade provided by palapas and palm trees. We don't use the pool, but I did notice that NO chairs available there after about 8.30 am - the towel game in full force! Not so bad on the beach....Lots of Europeans, not too many North Americans..so quite a few topless and speedos! Soft sand and turquoise water; but, I would recommend water shoes as there's quite a bit of \"debris\" churned up at the water's edge when it's wavy (I think from the reclamation project) and ankles get a bit of a beating..... They have a fun, talented and energetic entertainment team who provide activities for most of the day that you can participate in or not... They also take part in the enjoyable shows in the evening and then interact with the guests afterwards, dancing to the DJ in the lobby. One of the few \"cons\" for me, personally, was the lack of AC in the main buffet area (and I live in Florida!) on the days when there wasn't much of a breeze.....I would also suggest for the ladies to take their own shampoo, conditioner and soap...theirs is from a dispenser and not too good. Also, Kleenex (none provided). We thoroughly enjoyed our vacation at this resort - I would say it surpassed our expectations for the price we paid. Happy travels!

We had actually booked 2 rooms at the Viva Wyndham Maya, but when we arrived there we were told they had overbooked and were upgrading us to the Viva Wyndham Azteca. The Azteca's rates are a little higher, so perhaps the move did represent a slight upgrade. We were well received by the front desk of both resorts, although I preferred the set-up of Azteca as it was not confusing. Please note that this resort insisted on the 3:00 p.m. check-in time. We have no problem with that--the hotel is booked, and their staff is working as hard as they can to ready the rooms for new patrons. Check in was quick and friendly. Since you are entitled to dinner reservations for 1 or 2 nights during your weekly stay, I would recommend your making those reservations as soon as you check in. If you wait, you may find nothing is available. The young lady who made our dinner reservations was very helpful to me, and when I needed to make a change, she was accommodating. Our rooms were fine. We have no complaints about noise, cleanliness, or the beds. We enjoyed the pool and the sea. Both were awesome. The staff was the best! Fernando and Mauricio were especially great to us, and we appreciated the energy and enthusiasm of all of these great young people. They are all upbeat and try to keep things lively. There are several dance lessons, aerobics, contests or games going on throughout the day, so if you don't like the noise generated by these activities, you should plan to get a spot down by the sea or go to another resort. This is not an especially noisy resort, but it's definitely more lively by the pool than anywhere else on the entire property. I saw several reviews from people who didn't like the food, but all of us thought it was fine. There are a lot of choices at every meal. At breakfast, they offer omelettes with your choice of \"extras,\" in addition to a huge variety of foods. We actually preferred the buffet over the restaurant scene (which we thought was a bit staid--though the food was good and was presented beautifully). The coffee was good, and I enjoyed the cappuccino on occasion. The juices, fruits, and fresh salsa were nice. The servers and bartenders were extremely attentive and quick to wait on us. I read a review of someone who complained about racism of some sort, but we didn't experience anything like this while we was there. The nightly shows are entertaining. We thought the staff did a tremendous job of dancing and acting. The Viva Maya has a bigger stage, but we actually left their comedy show to return to the show at Azteca. Beginning at 8:00 each day, bicycles are available for free rental. I would recommend this as a good way to enjoy the immediate Playacar area. They give you a lock, so if you take the trip into town, you can lock it up and enjoy your walk around the area. I would not recommend the tennis. The court is fine enough, but the wind is definitely an issue. The court is located on the roof, and I would imagine wind is almost always a factor there! If we go back to Playa del Carmen, we would definitely stay at Viva Azteca again.

A nice walk along the beach, morning, noon or night felt safe. Drinks were good and the liquor wasn't watered down... The bartenders would ask if you wanted a lot of alcohol or a little. And a lot meant a lot. Cons: Food service was awful. I had to get my own drinks most of the time whether it be wine, soda, juice or coffee. Mattresses are impossibly firm and uncomfortable, the rooms definitely show their age (sloppy paint/trim carpentry, poor quality remodeling). The food was very hit and miss... Some of their Mexican dishes were good, sometimes they had carved meat (pork, turkey) that was good, but cutting up hot dogs and calling it sausage for breakfast doesn't work for me and the scrambled eggs were pinkish. Putting bologna on pizza and calling it pepperoni or slicing hot dogs and putting that on pizza as sausage was so bizarre. Front desk staff is generally not very helpful. Rooms were not very insulated from outside noise making it difficult to sleep at times. Overall, the things that were subpar about this resort didn't keep me from having a nice vacation, but if I had it to do over again i would absolutely stay elsewhere. Anyone giving this a 5 out of 5 rating is being paid to do so. 4 out of 5 is possible, but seems highly unlikely. It is a 2 to 3 star resort. Nothing more, nothing less. In fact, the reason I am giving this 3 stars has more to do with the location than the quality of the resort. On a positive note, Los Rancheros in Playa has amazing mahi mahi and grilled shrimp. I had a great experience deep sea fishing with Captain Ricks in Puerto Aventuras, Xel Ha was good (not great, but good), rented scooters in Cozumel and drove down to \"The Money Bar\" (formerly Dzul Ha) and really enjoyed the amazing clarity and visibility of the water. A tip for Dzul Ha/The Money Bar is to bring water shoes. There are a lot of sea urchins near the shore. Have a great trip.

It's not really fair to expect 5 star results from a 3 star resort. In saying all that, I went to this resort expecting a 3 star and I was very happy with everything. Now, I am a travel agent, so I had heard lots of great reviews on this resort and had no hesitation in booking it in the first place...also, as an agent, I tend to have higher expectations. I went with my boyfriend and 2 other couples (virgin travellers)...we all enjoyed the resort thoroughly. Yes, the rooms are dated and the beds are hard...for the amount of time I spent in the room, I didn't care and a hard bed is good for the back! There is no dresser / bureau in the room...only 2 drawers in the closest and 2 shelves...didn't care about that. No facecloths in the bathroom...didn't care about that either. The room was a lilttle musty, yes, but HELLO!...you're in the Caribbean, what did you expect? Next time take a scented candle with you, problem solved. The room was extremely clean. We requested ground floor knowing that the balconys are not the kind you can put your chair out on. Loved the ground floor. The dining was pretty good. We only visited the buffet and the Italian restaurant. The Italian was very good. The buffet was good / very good...lots of variety daily but kind of repeated everyday. For one week you'd be ok, for 2 weeks you would likely get a little bored of the buffett. As others have mentioned, it is a little difficult to get your 3 reservations a week in at the a la cartes, even though they were half empty most of the time...the resort needs to work on that. Also, they say you can dine at Viva Maya as well...not really, We were told Azteca only has 4 seats / day at Maya...that's right, 4 seats only so our party of 6 would never be able to get in. You can get WiFi for 5 hours for free...but sites such as Facebook and Hotmail are blocked. If you can't live without these sites, it's about $2 for $35 to sit at their computers. The pool is quite large but be very careful...the tile is SOOOO slippery...try to stay on the rubber mats. Entertainment was ok. Daily the staff would try to gather folks for Aqua-Gym, Merenge lessons, volleyball, beach yoga, darts, etc. We went to one evening show which was ok for resort entertainment. Thursday night the resort allowed vendors to set up in the courtyard area. The beach was simply amazing. Powder fine white sand, huge, lots of space and the 6 of us never had an issue finding 6 loungers together. Lots of shade or sun, whatever you want. No beach bar but the pool bar was about a 30 second walk...why anyone would ever complain about that I'll never know. Maybe take a big resort mug or get a couple drinks at a time if this concerns you. 10 - 15 minute walk down the beach to the 5th Ave shopping area. Or $7 by taxi. You could wander around all day down there....lots to see. Staff was friendly and helpful. Only complaint there is that our wakeup call was 20 minutes late on our checkout day...that could have meant someone didn't get a shower if we hadn't set our Ipod too. I would definitely return to this resort. I would say great value and I will recommend to my clients who are looking to spend their hard earned money wisely.

Upon arrival on 4/9 at about 2 PM, and after giving all documents for check-in (about 1/2hour process) we were told that our adjoining room had a water problem, and we would be put up at the Iberostar down the street. Needless to say, with 2 babies, carseats, strollers and luggage, this was a major inconvenience. Additionally, the Iberostar was not expecting us, and checking into our rooms there, on different floors, was not completed until 5 PM. We returned the next day to the Wyndham where we were told there was no connecting room although we were put in rooms next to each other. The rooms were adequate, although there were 2 beds in each room, and the refrigerator in our room never worked, despite 3 attempts by maintenance to repair or replace it. Again, with children needing cold milk, this was a problem. For our inconvenience, we were given 4 vouchers for massages. The first person in our party used this on Tuesday and was asked for the voucher, leaving us to deal with the front desk to try to get the other 3 vouchers honored and to make appointments. This took at least 4 visits to the desk, including speaking to a \u201cmanager\u201d Wendy, who called the spa, unaware that it was not open at 9:30 AM, and told me to return again after 10 and it would be \u201cno problem\u201d to straighten this out. As this meant another return to the desk, where Wendy was no longer to be found, it was a problem, but we settled it with another clerk. After all of this, 2 in our party did not want massages, and there was no offer of compensation, so we settled on a haircut ($26, not $50) and one of our party took 2 massages. I feel the customer service was very poor, and we did not appreciate the lack of apology for the inconveniences we had. While the pool area was lovely, it was also very slippery, and despite runners that were laid down, our grandson fell twice, and we witnessed other children and adults fall on a daily basis. How they are not being sued for injuries is beyond me. If you go, be very careful. The pool/activities staff is great, the shows not so much. The buffet was plentiful, if repetitious, and the food in the specialty restaurants quite good. Reservations there were hard to come by even though there seemed numerous empty tables when we were there. Make your reservations the day you arrive and cancel them later if you don\u2019t want them.

Rooms: Were average, very clean, shower was excellent. We had a room right outside the pool area. Wasn't noisy and never had problems hearing other people. Maids were always great about giving you more water if you asked. They do an excellent job keeping the facilities clean. There always seemed to be someone moping/sweeping floors and cleaning tables where ever you went. Service at front desk: The only down fall to our trip was when we checked in. The front desk people (Wendy, the manager in particular) need to work on their customer service. We stood there for 1.5 hours going around and around with the price of the room. My sister booked her and her daughters vacation through Wyndham Vacations and in the contract it said each additional person staying in the room would be charged $61.25 extra a night of which I planned on paying. We verified this before we left and were told they will just bill you when you check in, no need to do anything else. They didn't care what the contract said and wanted to charge $106/night even though it was in black and white on the contract. They kept pushing this piece of paper with the daily rates on it in front of our faces. We really felt they were hoping we would back down and leave. Wendy offered to move me to the sister hotel for the cheaper rate, that would make a lot of sense. Then she asked if you don't mind waiting for 20-30 min she would call reservations of which I don't believe she ever called but we waited and waited. After waiting 20 min I asked them to call the number on our reservation and they connected me to some other Wyndham vaca place it was so ridiculous! We wasted another 15 min talking with this guy who had no idea what he was doing and didn't have our reservation number because it was for people that were Wyndham members. When I finally asked if they dialed the number on our reservation she said she dialed a number they had\u2026ugh. I finally spoke to the reservation people to explain what was going on and they asked to talk to the manager of which Wendy took the call in the back room. Five min later the other girl we were dealing with came back and said we will charge you $77 just like that. I said fine. I would have loved to have just left. They were so unfriendly and not a smile from either of them or an apology. It isn\u2019t a way you want to start your vacation especially when the rest of the group is out hanging by the pool in the sun. They offer free WiFi however it was a hit or miss if you could get on. We tried daily and only got on a few times. Food: we only got into the Italian restaurant otherwise we ate at the buffet and in town. The buffet wasn't as bad as other places I have been. However, a number of us ended up with sour stomaches so bring imodium.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Azteca\u201d", "Author": "kat-traveler9091", "ReviewID": "UR103337519", "Content": "We (2 parents, an 11 and 14 year old) stayed for 2 weeks at the Azteca. I was a bit wary as I am not usually an all inclusive type of traveller; actually, we've never stayed at an all inclusive and usually prefer small towns and low key areas. Having said that, I was pleasantly surpised by how much I enjoyed the Azteca. My husband and kids loved it. Our comments: The staff - very warm and friendly . Everybody made us feel welcome indluding: the front desk, wait staff, bartenders, porters, cleaning, gym and spa staff, as well as the incredibly energetic animation team. That reason alone would bring us back to the Azteca. Many of the resorts have the same amenities, but the feeling at the Azteca was wonderful. I hope they reward all of the staff for their incredible work ethic and hospitality. The environs - lovely grounds, nice pool, beautiful beach. Always beach chairs available, but problem with towels on unoccupied chairs at the pool. Unless the management works on changing this, it won't change. We went for a day to Akumal and I saw signs at a resort that indicated that if towels were left on chairs without occupants, they would be removed and could be picked up at the desk. GREAT IDEA! If it was part of the culture of this resort, then it would be easy for everyone to get a chair when they wanted it. I would love to see this in place for the future. Activities: Lots to do or nothing to do. Nice to have the choice. It was red flag at the beach for most of the days that we were there, which was great for playing in the waves, but didn't allow for the other water sports. The animation staff lets you know when activities are taking place and you can join in if you like. We played a lot of beach volleyball, bocce ball, soccer, tennis and I also enjoyed the dance lessons and pool workouts. Lots of fun. There was a bit of a gap for young teens like our children. They need to get this age group more engaged. They are kind of left out : not wanting to be in the kids' club and too young for the adult activities. It was a shame that they didn't allow for my son who is 14 to play in the beach volleyball tournament. He had played in a number of games and easily held his own, but apparently some adults don't like the kids in the tournaments. That didn't feel quite right. I also have to mention the picking of teams for the tournaments. Argh! I'm an adult and don't want to be subjected to captains and being 'picked' , or left standing and picked last (double argh!!). Really. Do we need to choose teams this way? The answer, is of course, no. Just have the organizers number participants 1,2,3,4 and you will have nice even teams without the humilitation. Entertainment: I went to a couple of shows and was impressed by the effort and energy of the staff who worked all day and then put on a show for the guests in the evening. My children really enjoyed going, and the Azteca is the kind of resort where they could go on their own and feel safe and comfortable. My only complaint was the Game Show. It was totally inappropriate for a family resort. Female contestants competing in the 'sexy dance' and beer drinking with lots of crude gestures and remarks. Very vulgar and trashy. Quite shocking really - lots of people left during the show, including my 11 year old daughter and I. Rooms: Fine for us. Beds a little on the hard side, but comfy enough. The staff will get you extra pillows or pillows that are firmer or softer. Meals: Buffet was okay. Enough variety, loved the fresh fruit, salads and thin crust pizza at the bar. Nice to have espresso for an afternoon latte. If you are a tea drinker (like me), bring your own. The teas were okay, but I like a good green tea in the morning as well as jasmine. They have black, chamomile, mint and herbal. Tours: Everything seems to cost $100.00 per person. It is very easy and safe to take the public buses or collectivos from the town of Playa del Carmen or hire a taxi to take you to most of the places for much less. Once there, just pay the entrance fees. Suggestions: Sunscreen is very expensive to buy locally - bring your own, bring lots and bring high spfs as well as a total sunblock and sunburn cream. Very necessary! For lots of water activities like snorkelling, a sunscreen shirt is also a great idea. I would also bring conditioner next time. They had shampoo and soap, but no conditioner. Also pack stuff for tummy troubles. We had good herbal and homeopathic remedies for both prevention and treatment and were thankful for these. We also followed the advice of a previous TripAdvisor contributor and brought lots of US one dollar bills for tipping - the wait staff, the bar staff , the maids, taxi drivers, and the list goes on. It came in handy to have for some small bills for very hard working people.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalamazoo, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cOverdue for a serious remodel!\u201d", "Author": "todabeach", "ReviewID": "UR103108711", "Content": "We've been on 9 all-inclusive trips to Mexico, 8 of which were absolutely excellent - then we went to Viva Wyndham Azteca. Major disappointment from start to finish. Great flight, great ride, we check into the 2 rooms we paid for 3 months ago and are informed they had a \"computer problem\" so only had 1 room for the first night and offered us a massage for credit! The family we were meeting there checked in later that day and they had NO rooms for their first night were shipped to another resort for the first 2 days! We did get our second room the next night. Unfortunately, the tub wouldn't drain and the smell of sewer gas was unbearable. They sent maintenance up and they were very nice and efficient and fixed the problems which were evidently related. Four days later we woke up to the same smell. There were septic issues elsewhere on the grounds and the occasional public bathroom flood too, as if the system just couldn't handle the number of rooms. The pool was not only the smallest of the resorts we ever stayed at, it was also the only one without a swim-up bar. There was not a separate kiddie pool; instead, it had a fence that looked like an old bike rack across the pool to set aside a place for the kids. The \"Sports Bar\" (actually the sign says \"Sport Bar\") had a nice pool table and two foosball tabLes but did not have a bar! Just an empty room, no staff, with a few games and a TV. The room refrigerators at every other resort we've stayed are refilled every day with a variety of water, beer and soft drinks. Not here - you were lucky to find 1 water, 1 beer and one can of soda. A staff housekeeper explained the new management set a new policy to cut back on restocking. At this resort, bottled water is NOT the place to cut back! The food at the buffet was reasonably good with decent variety. Good thing as reservations at the restaurants were near impossible to come by. We booked for the week the first day and were only able to get one table for 2 one night and one table for 3 the other. The Wi-Fi was down more than it was up. On the plus side, the entertainment staff made the best of a tired facility by involving everyone and setting a fun tone all day, every day. The beach is absolutely beautiful and the resort is on a great road which makes it a very pleasant, safe 20-minute walk to one of the best downtowns in Mexico: many great restaurants and shops, and a pier with a ferry that runs regularly to Cozumel. Perfect location. The majority of the guests are European, mostly Germans, some Italians, Americans and Canadians, a good cross-section of cultures. Lots of men in Speedos if you're into that kind of thing. The only way this place is acceptable is if you have never been to another resort to compare. There are many wonderful resorts in Mexico that are priced the same or lower that are light years ahead of Wyndham Viva Azteca. I would be shocked if Apple Vacations and other tour agencies don't cross this one off their list without a major remodeling.

Everyone had a wonderful time, weather was perfect, as usual. This was our 6th stay in the Playa del Carmen area, and our first to this property. We try to stay at different locations each time we visit, so we definitely know the routine of the area and have a point of reference when it comes to properties. The Viva Azteca definitely offers a lot for the money and a great value, especially for families travelling with children. The Pros: The location and close proximity to downtown Playa/5th Avenue. Easy and very safe walking distance to downtown, either by beach or by street. Free and friendly bike rentals. Huge beach with many lounge chairs and lots of palapas for shade. Free boogie boards, kayaks, and free catamaran rentals (complete with guide). The animation staff is absolutely outstanding, and they have smiles on from morning beach and pool games until well into the evening while dancing in the lobby bar after their show closes. Large, spacious rooms, lots of counter space in bathrooms. Restaurants have very good quality food. Great thin-crust pizza available at pool snack bar all day and evening. Friendly bartenders and other staff. The Cons: No room amenities, not even facial tissue or decent soap. No pool or beach bar service, and only ONE bartender on duty, occasionally two (for the ENTIRE pool/bar area! Others have posted that there room was stocked with beer - we asked our bellman about beer, and were told \"no,\" (this, even after tipping him). Mini fridge stocked with one large bottle of water and 2 sodas. Front desk staff - we had called the resort prior to arrival and requested an ocean-front room. We were told they were available, but they wouldn't reserve the room under my credit card; instead saying, \"it will be available when you arrive.\" Guess what - it wasn't. Again, after travelling to this area many times, we know the games, so we weren't surprised. We were given a ground-floor, pool-view room, which actually turned out to be quite nice. If possible, request a ground-floor room, as the upper-level floors have only very small balconies with only room to stand, and no chairs for sitting outside. The ground-floor rooms have little patios and chairs for outside sitting. Worst complaint? The restaurant reservation game. Yes, its true you're \"allowed\" 3 restaurant reservations for a weeks' stay; getting those, however, takes persistence and patience. The buffet gets real old, real fast, so make your restaurant reservations as soon as you arrive. When we did arrive at our designated reservation times, we were shocked to find the restaurants were virtually empty. One evening (in Bamboo) our party was literally the only group in the restaurant. My assumption is that due to the much higher quality of food served in the restaurants, they try to drive guests to the buffets for reduced costs. Also, no room service. Overall, we did have a very nice stay at this property, and it does offer a wonderful Playa experience for the money.

We were pleasantly surprised with almost everything. We did get a really good deal, and therefore while we have stayed at nicer places, this place was definite value for the money. The hotel was a smaller one, which we really liked, but you also have access to their sister property, the Viva Wyndham Maya which is only a 5min walk away. We liked that the buffet was a different theme each evening, but we did get tired of the breakfast buffet, always being the same. We found the service to be excellent all around. We had 3 dinners at the A La Carte restaurants and we really enjoyed them. The Xul Ha at the Azteca was our favorite of the three. And when you get a little sick of the Buffet at the Azteca, it's definitely worth hitting the Buffet at the Maya..... it seemed to have alot more options, but being a bigger property it was definitely busier. We also found the entertainment staff were quite fun and friendly but never pressured you too much to join their games. These were the same staff that did the Entertainment Show in the evening..... while it's obvious they're not trained dancers, we really appreciated their honest effort and they always seemed to be having a good time, we enjoyed it! We went over to the Maya to check out their show, which was a more elaborate outdoor amphitheatre, but to be honest, it was really lacking in effort and enthusiasm and heart on the part of the dancers...... we definitely felt the little tight-knit group at our place was better. The rooms were nice enough, and clean. The shower water pressure was awesome and we never had trouble getting hot water. The bed was harder than I like, but that's par for the course down there. And the room would sometimes have a musty odor..... pretty common at alot of the hotels from what I've heard. There is no Disco/Nightclub at the hotel and we were happy about that..... we didn't have loud drunk people to listen to all hours of the night! The beach was nice and we never had any troubles getting sunchairs or finding some shade with the palapas. And if you walk down the beach it's only 15 min walk to Playa Del Carmen. If you like to snorkel, I would suggest, walk to Playa Del Carmen (or taxi for $7) and just a block or two North of the Ferry dock, on 5th avenue you'll find the Bus Station. (There is a map the hotel can give you.) It's only $2 to take the bus to Puerto Morelos (about 30min away). The bus was very comfortable with movies, and AC. The bus drops you off on the highway, and it is still a 20 min walk into the beach/town, or there's a smaller bus that'll take you into the town for 5 pesos (50 cents). Be warned if you do walk, as we did, there's a swamp on the right side and we saw a crocodile in there!! At the pier there's a Snorkel Hut where we paid $25 to go out to the Nationally Protected Reef, hitting up 2 spots..... and I've snorkelled alot and I have to say it was AWESOME! Definitely worth it! Tons of fish, amazing corals, and we saw barracudas and stingrays! And there's a large hut style restaurant to the right where you can grab some lunch and a cold beer!

Location is great, you can walk to Playa Del Carmen, Playacar is a nice area to go for a walk, even at night, it is gated with security. We were here with our 5 month old and our 4 year old. The two concerns we had was that the pool did not have any shaded area for kids to play in. Even though the pool is small you don't notice this as the beach is right there and most people go there for some baking in the sun. The second area of concern was the room ammenities, a bit dated, no in room clock. Have seen much better, but it was not enough to put a kink on things.

Do know that almost none of the public areas of the property are air conditioned--not the front desk, bars, buffet, or some of the ala cartes. Everything is open air! The rooms are spacious and clean and the cleaning staff was very responsive to our needs. The rooms did have a musty smell that we fought off with scented candles. Yes, the beds are hard, but oh, well. It was really lovely to have a sliding glass door and a minifridge in the room (ours was stocked with beer, soda, juice and water). The tub was very spacious and there was plenty of counterspace in the bathroom. At night, the resort all but dies which leads me to believe it really does attract a non-party, perhaps older crowd. There were a few kids around, but not many by any stretch of the imagination. The front desk staff was not overly friendly towards us. Our check in was a little rough, as we stood in line, next in line, for quite some time before someone would help us. The clerk took no time to explain any amenities or features of the resort. We did get the welcome \"cocktail\" which was just fruit juice, but very welcome after a long day of traveling! Unfortunately, whoever was supposed to help with our bags never appeared so we hiked it back to our room ourselves (weary and tired of waiting on other folks) and passed him on the way. Later in the week, we were expecting a small delivery and when we inquired the day after we expected it to arrive, the front desk said nothing had come for us. When we asked again, they suddenly remembered it had come. No one had called to tell us, which is a little below service standards in my opinion. The bartenders and waiters were very attentive, friendly and fun. We enjoyed them all. Do not expect top shelf liquor here. They had a few mid-level brands (Skyy, Stoli, Beam) and some decent tequilas, but if you don't ask for it, you won't get it. If you do ask for it, you will get it, though! The food left something to be desired. If you're a foodie or have high expectations of quality, I don't recommend staying here. It was the same stuff, different day in a different form. However, if food is low on your list of priorities and you want a comfortable place to stay with great beach access, then this is a very affordable place to book. We loved being able to borrow cruiser bikes from the resort. They were well maintained and the man who loaned them to us was very sweet and quite enthusiastic about his bikes.

We walked to Playa del Carmen from the beach no problem. Many beautiful villas to be seen on the way by the beach. ACTIVITY: We made a day at XPLOR\u2026 I adored. We did Zip-lines, 4 wheeler, and swam and raft in cenotes. I highly recommend it. The buffet for dinner is included and was very good. The site is approximately 15 minutes from the hotel. There were peoplewho went to Chichen Itza\u2026 But be aware it is a minimum of 3 hours toget there. We also went 3-4 times to Playa del Carmen just to stroll and one night there was a parade. It was the start of the carnaval from March 6th. By walking, Playa is 20 minutes until the beginning of the 5th avenue. In summary, I recommend this hotel and I would go back there any time. It is not a 5*, therefore I did not expect it and got what I wanted.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, Canada", "Title": "\u201cOverpriced for what you get\u201d", "Author": "Wavi62", "ReviewID": "UR99175033", "Content": "Clean room, no elevators.

We stayed at the Viva Wyndham Azteca for 2 weeks ending March 3 2011. My husband and I in one room and my father who turned 80 on our visit in another. We booked only a month before our trip so we ended up with rooms in the 3000 block facing a fence. The room were excellent!, Very clean, large double sink counter bathroom with Tub and shower. Lots of storage area and free safety deposit box! Had I booked earlier I would of asked for a room facing the gardens ,pool or ocean. Under the circumstances the hotel was full and as the room were so good we didn\u2019t bother. The only issue with the 3000 block is the nightly entertainment is quite loud till 11 pm.. It never bothered us, but ear plugs were an asset. Having read some of the previous comments about the hotel, my main comment is.. if you had a problem did you give the frount counter a chance to fix it!.. I was EXTREEMLY impressed with the resolving of any problem we had!.. Our issues were minor.. My dad needed a softer bed, ours was fine.. a bed cushioner was delivered before noon! I found the pillows very firm..I asked if softer ones were available and they were delivered within 5 minutes! My husband takes medication so we had a need for more than 1 bottle of water a day, and I also wanted to have a can of diet coke in the fridge available.. I asked the maid with a note on our pillow, and everyday we had 3 bottles of water and the pop I wanted. I asked about WIFI and was given a pass code good for 5 hours! And renewable with no problem. The WIFI worked very good in the early morning at all 3 WIFI zones.. it cut out a bit in the afternoon and evening when so many people were using it. The hotel also provides a computer room with 4 computers and internet available for 25 peso\u2019s for 30 minutes. ( I think that in this day and age and the cheap cost of computers ,hotels should soon provide this service for free) Food was available 24 hours a day..When the dining room was closed and at lunch the pool bar had really fabulous pizza\u2019s, hamburgers, hotdogs, salad and nachos fixing\u2019s available. As well as dessert goodies with individual made coffee, cafeolait, espresso, cappuccino etc in the early morning and late into the night! The pool bar had a wonderful patio to look over the pool and see the beautiful sea. As I had no balcony view I sat here every morning and watched the sunrise while using my computer ( WIFI zone as well!)and having a specially made coffee! It was quiet and very pleasant.. Roberto was always smiling and greeted me every morning. Leonardo made our breakfasts even more enjoyable.. he greeted us every morning and delivered coffee and juice every day. As for the cold pancakes and French toast.. I solved that problem by putting them through the toaster one time.. problem solved!.. The omelettes were very good and bacon was available every morning along with a great selection of fruit and anything else you might want. We found the buffets very plentiful with a huge selection..The only comment I would make is to make sure the very spicey items are marked, especially on Mexican night.. My dad ended up having a habanera he thought was green pepper! We also saw a young lady who took some meat balls and found out they also were quite spicey. We love spicey food but it should be marked. There are six restaurants available 3 at each resort Viva Azteca and Viva Maya with a dress code, we went to 5 of them and ran out of time.. We also at on 5th Ave on 2 evenings..We really liked all the restaurants, the Mayan and Bamboo especially , the service at all of them was very good, a wine list was also available but we enjoyed the house wine so much we never bothered! We wished the food at the Italian at the Maya was warmer, but we realized they have to walk up and down 2 flights of stairs to get the food!.. the view was worth it though! This comment is for those that ate at the specialty restaurants and left a 20 peso tip or none at all. \u201cSHAME ON YOU\u201d! These waiters work so hard to please you, a tip to thank them is the least you can do! I am very surprised that the staff never looked for tips and were sometimes surprised even when we left one! I also would like to mention the bicycles!.. some were even new! The bike staff were very helpful adjusting bikes etc, It is a great area to bike around. Remember to only bike on the right sidewalk! PS bells and mirrors would be helpful. Our overall experience at the Azteca was very very good, I loved that it was a smaller hotel than most others on the strip, the meal,bar,housekeeping and front counter staff were always courteous with wonderful smiles, the entertainment staff were a lot of fun and mixed with the guests all the time, and Willmer the concierge was especially a favourite. I was also very impressed with the diversity of tourists, Although spoken widely I think English was a minority language at this hotel! A majority of the staff could converse in up to 5 languages! I would strongly recommend this hotel to families and mature patrons, it is not a party hotel. The younger crowd would probably prefer the larger sister hotel the Maya for that! Thank you for a wonderful holiday.

Hotel Loved: - Cleanliness (perfect all the time - they are always cleaning) - Friendliness (staff and guests alike) - Small resort so you can make friends and see them everyday without hunting for them. - Buffets (great food, lots of variety, different themes each day) - Pool area (lots of chairs, great area for very small kids, fun for tweens, pool bar overlooks the pool - for us adults who liked relaxing) - Beach (nice sand, lots of chairs, you are not hassled by beach vendors much at all) - Watersports area at beach (free kayaking, boogie boards, sailboating with captain, other paid trips snorkeling, parasailing, sea-doos) - Italian Restaurant - Hotel Service (Simply exceptional) - Playacar security (always felt safe) Hotel Liked: - Mexican and Asian restaurants (would just go to buffet instead of booking these two al a carte restaurants - more convenient and better selection for kids) - Rooms (average, but very clean and had everything we needed) - Close to 5th avenue in Playa Del Carmen (interesting shopping) - Close to Playacar shopping area (just as cheap and a lot cleaner) Hotel Disliked: - Beds (too hard) - 1 week was too short Area Loved: - Lush jungle (green and flowers everywhere) - Beach are clean and great sand (all resorts raked off anything that washed ashore early in the morning) - Very friendly (tourism is the major industry) Area Liked: - Felt safe everywhere Area Disliked: - Too far from where I live (otherwise would visit more often) Adventures/Tours: - Coba Extreme tour - Climbed to the top of the Mayan ruins for a great view above the jungle - Great history lesson from knowledgeable guides - Lunch in a Mayan village (got to see how rural people live) - Zip lining across a lake in the jungle (short but exhilarating) - Mayan cleansing ceremony before going underground - Repelling into a cenote (cave with a lake at the bottom) and swimming around in the darkness for 1/2 hour was awesome! Best part of the trip for me! - They supplied water bottles all day as well - Can book through the hotel or in the shopping areas - can not taxi this one - too far. - Explore Theme park - Zip lining was awesome. We got there early ~9:15 and went right to the zip lines. We never waited and went on each circuit (about 14 zip lines total, plus a water slide). Water landings are the best! We looked later in the day and it looked like there was about an hour wait to start the circuits. - ATV'ing was ok (just follow the paths, but you go through caves - cool). This seemed to be a long wait early, but we went in the afternoon and didn't have to wait. - Swimming through the caves was very cool - no waiting, you can walk most of the places and there are exits everywhere in case someone gets claustrophobic. - Paddling through the caves was also cool, but slower because there always seems to be someone in front of you who doesn't know how to paddle. - Restaurant was buffet and really good (all free with entry) - Would recommend pre-purchasing tickets via the web and taking a taxi to the park though. We were done everything early and had to sit around and wait for the bus for a couple hours (in the restaurant relaxing - but no adult drinks at the park) - Xel-Ha water Park - We swam with the Dolphins as a family and really really really enjoyed it (highlight of the kids trip and probably my wife's) - Good snorkeling, by the floating bridge (do the river swim - they give you gear at the top and then continue to the bridge) - Cliffs to jump off (and my son did many many times) was cool - Missed the cave swim, but heard it was good - The restaurants/bars were pretty good (all free with entry) - Lots of hammocks to have a short siesta in while the kids played - Would also take a taxi here so you can leave when you want (can pre-order entry online) - ATV'ing through the Jungle + Horseback rinding on the beach - Me and my 11 year old son did the atv'ing through the jungle and had a good time - My wife and our 13 year old daughter did the horseback riding and didn't really enjoy it - Note that we grew up in northern Canada and can ATV and Horseback ride anytime we want, so we wanted to do more. If you don't get the opportunity to do those things then this would probably be worth it. General Info: - Most places take Peso's, US Dollars and Canadian Dollars - Take lots of US single Dollars for tipping (Say $100 for the week) - Cancun airport is busy - it will take time to get in and get out (just accept it) - When leaving the airport if you are with a vacation packager (we were with Sunwing) then just get your bags and follow the crowd to the bus area - once at the busses they have lots of people to help you find the bus to take you to your hotel. Lots of people asking to help you in the airport main area, but they are doing it for tips. Also - don't rush, you will probably be sitting on the bus waiting for someone else so relax, and grab a beer for the bus if you want. Bottom line: I would go back and stay at the Viva Wyndham Azteca.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cWonderful and relaxing...walk to Playa de Carmen\u201d", "Author": "livingonsunshine", "ReviewID": "UR98657662", "Content": "I found this resort to be very cozy and well kept.

For me the best thing was the location...just minutes from Playa de Carmen, where there is tons of shops (on 5th Avenue) and the pier where the boat leaves to bring vacationers to Cozumel. We were able to sign out bikes at our hotel and bike there..maybe 5 min's or so. On the way there are paths where you can see Mayan ruins on the way...beautiful. In Playa de Carmen we found a small shop (as you enter playa de carmens strip, walking or biking, the 3rd or 4th shop on the right) called 5th Avenue Tours, you'll find a lady Esther (Esthel) who got us great excursions for discounted prices. We even had a free trip and a few gifts booking with her. GO SEE HER!!. All in all we had a wonderful trip...after you've been to many resorts the food all seems the same..as was here, the food was good...pretty much like the rest. If you like to snorkel be sure to go to Xcaret...it's all inclusive food and drinks, all the snorkeling you want and other things...well worth the money. Have a great holiday!!

The room we had was fantastic and two steps away from the beach. We were in room 1103 and my and uncle were in an adjoining room 1104. The room was always kept very clean and we never found any creapy crawly creatures in our room. The beach was beautiful and there were no stones or rocky coral in our corner of the beach. On a clear day you could see right to Cozumel. The animation team really took the time to mingle with the guests and to get to know them a little. They work very long hours and are very good at what they do. They also animate the shows in the evening. They did a really god job on most shows but on comedy night we walked out. The show was just not funny. However they were a blast by the beach and around the pool. I even went for a Merengue lesson. All of the staff are very friendly and go out of the way to be helpful. We found no one to be rude. The bartenders were quick and efficient and knew their menu well. The hotel is quaint and small. Our rooms were right next to the pool and the beach and we found it very quiet at night. If you are into the night life and like to party late I would not stay here. It is a must quieter crowd. We loved it. The food was o.k. We never had to stand in line very long at the bufftet and there is quite a bit of variety. The buffet changes every evening and goes with a theme night. These were mostly good. The breakfasts were by far the best meal of the day. They had everything from omelettes to French toast, fresh fruit and cheeses. We always ate a really big breakfast. The a la carte restaurants were o.k. We tried all three at our hotel. Our favorite was the oriental followed by the Italian and our least favorite was the Mayan restaurant. The Mayan restaurant was beautiful because you could eat outside. The grounds of then hotel are very well maintained. They have different animals visit each day. They also have a few residents called Coati Mundi or Tehron in Spanish. They are from the racoon family and seem to love people. My husband fed one of them from his hand. They also have a creature called a Sereque. Look like a big rat with no tail. We took about a five minute walk and found our sister hotel Viva Maya. We could have eaten there are any one of the restaurants but did not. Across the street from the Maya there is a small market. We found a Starbucks and other little mexican shops. We found better deals and more selection in Playa del Carmen. We went twice to Playa del Carmen. It was a 20 minute walk from our hotel of a five minute cab ride. We did the cab ride to save our feet for walking in Playa. We always felt very safe walking to and from our hotel as we were in a gated community. We loved our stay in Mexico and would send all of our family and friends to this hotel. we have no complaints. We have to say it was our first time in Mexico at an all inclusive hotel.

We found it to be a good 3-1/2 star resort. Our room was a basic hotel room with a nice view of the pool. The air-conditioning in the room worked well and it was average quiet at night. We did not hear noise from other rooms but did hear a loud party at the pool bar one night. The buffet food was just so-so but we have learned not to expect much from an all-inclusive buffet. There was good variety and the food tasted good but items that should be hot are just warm. We have found this to be typical of the resorts we have been to. The a la carte restaurants were excellent. We tried all 3 and were very happy with the food and the service. We especially enjoyed the mayan/mexican restaurant. One complaint is with the wine service. The house wine which is part of the all-inclusive is awful. In fact I found it undrinkable. It would be nice if the resort offered wine by the glass, at an additional charge, in the a la carte restaurants. They do offer wine by the bottle at an additional charge but not glasses or even 1/2 litres. I love a glass or 2 of wine with my meal but my Wife doesn't and I don't want to buy a whole bottle for 2 glasses. We used the pool and found it to be clean and comfortable. Not too loud and crazy like at other resorts we have been to. The beach is fantastic! We spent 2 or 3 hours every day at the beach and loved it. Nice sand, no big rocks and not crowded. It was difficult to find deck chairs at the pool but there was always chairs available on the beach. It is a leisurely walk of 25 minutes to the start of 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carman and you can go either by beach or sidewalk. We recommend you take the sidewalk at least once and check out the mayan ruins along the way. We did a lot of walking on the beach and around Playacar and also took the bicycles out once. The whole resort is well maintained and super clean. The staff are friendly and helpful. Oh yea, the COFFEE! One of my pet peeves about Mexican resorts is the quality of the coffee, usually awful, but not at Viva Azteca. At the main bar and the pool bar they have espresso machines and make great coffee, espresso, cappuccino, etc. I was in heaven. We walked to the Viva Wyndham Mayan resort one day to do a little comparing. It seams that the Mayan is the same as the Azteca except there are more rooms. We noticed that the pool area and the beach were much more crowded and busy at the Mayan than at the Azteca so if you are trying to decide among the 2 and prefer a quieter place I would recommend the Azteca. There was a nice mix of people at the Azteca, young families, 20 somethings, older adults, and mostly Canadians and Europeans.

My two teenagers said it was the best time of their lives. It was really the people who work there and the location that made the vacation. While the rooms and food are adequate, it was a terrific value overall. The best parts of the vacation were the location on a beautiful white sand beach, on a turquoise ocean, and the entertainment staff. The \"animation team\" did a great job getting the kids involved in activities during the day, then they put on a fun show at night, followed by a lively dance party in the lounge. My son especially enjoyed the merengue lessons with Ixchel, though he made friends with several of the team and said they made him feel special. While the dancers are talented individually, the performances look like they would benefit from more practice to appear more professional. Dodo is SPECTACULAR!!! The bartenders at the lounge and at the pool bar were also terrific, always smiling and trying to please the guests. Too few guests tip; they deserve more! The rooms are adequate, would benefit from more storage space. The buffet food was mediocre, but there is always salad, fruit and yogurt. I eat mostly vegetarian, as does my daughter, so that worked for us. The food choices were harder for my son, though the pizza at the pool snack bar was always good when hot. We went into Playa del Carmen for dinner most nights. However, we always had to head back because my kids didn't want to miss the nightly show and dance party that followed. The pool was really nice, but the people who reserve early and then just leave the lounge chairs reserved make it nearly impossible to get a chair there. I'm a single mom, and it can be difficult to find a place that satisfies both of my very different children. This is the first vacation we have taken when both kids were fully satisfied. Because the resort is in a gated community and relatively small compared, it felt safe to let the teenagers hang out into the night with all the new friends they met from the entertainment staff, as well as guests from all over the US and Canada. We are already talking about returning next year.

The room was not much to speak about, basic room, not enough drawer space, but very clean. Beds were okay, noise was minimal. It is a comfortable resort. Where the Azteca falls short is in the food category. They have 3 dinner restaurants that you have to reserve for and a buffet restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. <they want you to eat at the buffet restaurant, period> The reservation only restaurants, while never full, almost never had an open reservation time - we managed a reservation in the Italian restaurant - it was very good - albeit plenty of empty tables. The buffet restaurant was adequate at best. It was the weakest link in the resort. Breakfast was just okay, lunches were good, and dinner was just food. The bar drinks were weak but plentiful. Tips added to the alcohol content. The lobby bar was the best. If you're coming here for great food and drink...don't come. If you want to relax in a comfortable atmosphere with friendly staff and don't mind weak drinks and just okay food (although the Mexican food they put out was very good), then consider the Azteca.

Dec 15/2010 was our second year in a row to this little gem. My wife and I travelled both years with our son (20) and daughter (18) and had an incredible vacation both years. The location is great with a 20 min walk to 5th ave by either beach or road and a 5 min walk to playa car and is very safe to be out night or day. Wyndham Maya the sister hotel which is available for use by Wyndham Azteca guests is about a 10 min walk. Rooms, grounds, beach, common areas, restaurants, bars and washrooms are always kept very clean and well stocked. Bar tenders are ready to serve you anytime of day or night. Night life is not the best but there is something for everyone only minutes away. If I had to make a complaint about something at the Azteca it would be the beds, they are very firm. The only other complaint is about the other travelers that make stupid remarks about the resort. For example...there was someone who had complained that there were to many Mexican chefs, what are you stupid, did you forget you were in Mexico. Another example are the ones that complain about not having enough in there bar fridge. I have to agree with you, all they put in is 1 or 2 bottles of water, a can of pop and a soda water. Well for those people, use your voice that you were given and ask for more instead of just complaining. The second day we used our big people words and asked for extra water and pop and each day after that there was enough water and pop for all 4 of us. You can take as many trips as you want since there is something for everybody, just don't depend on your Vacation rep all the time. Be a little adventureous and book things on your own you will save lots of money. For snorkeling, don't spend the $75 each to go to Akumal Bay, instead take a $25-$30 cab to Akumal Beach and go swim with the turtles there. The Mexican, Italian and Japanees restaurants are all excellent, book as soon as you get there they do fill up fast. If you like golf there is a golf course within a 5 min walk and another about a 5 min cab ride. The hotel is about a 50min direct ride from the airport in a mini van but can be a 1hr 45 min ride by tour bus. If the hotel rating is keeping people away then don't change it, but in our opinion it should be higher it more then deserves it. Just go with an open mind, have fun and relax and you won't go wrong with the Viva Wyndham Azteca. Great Hotel, great value.

We arrived on 25th of Dec. from Vancouver / Canada for a whole week. This resort is marked as 3 stars but honestly they should mark it up to 4 stars. The resort is even better than what the pictures show so we were beyond pleased. The hotel had lots to do and was in a very peaceful location. The Ocean was breathtaking. The staffs and bar tenders were absolutely amazing, very kind, helpful, funny and charming. We actually made a lot of friends. The rooms were very clean and spacious. The service was outstanding. Everyday there was a new menu so you never got tired of the buffet. New years eve was absolutely incredible. Lots of good food and service, in fact it was so good that we cancelled a restaurant reservation to enjoy the food at the buffet. We never got tired from food or drinks and certainly not from the staff. We recommend this place to everyone who would like to soak up the Sun and have lots of fun with the staff and the other guests.

Airport to resort transport efficient and comfortable and clean. Check-in efficient. Responsive + caring staff. Excellent facility for family vacation: self-contained resort w many organized activities rum by top-notch entertainment team. 20-min walk to Playa del Carmen (on beach or on local residential road in secure, gated community) and 5-min walk to local tourist market across the street w best-prices in town for hoodies, bracelets, blankets, back packs. Bikes provided w locks are in excellent condition and fun. Streets relatively cool, calm and quiet before 10 a.m. so best to bike ride early. Access to sister \"Maya\" resort 5-min walk to high-wire trapeze + use of its facilities but we preferred the \"Azteca.\" Maya resort had about 483 rooms: was larger but not better. On-site market 1x per week. Air-conditioning worked well after we switched out of 1 room where air conditioner not working well. Beds comfortable + firm, not brick hard. Pool clean and more than adequate. On-site scuba diving resources recommeded for all levels of scuba experience but smaller group of 4 or less work best for indiv attention. All gear supplied. Recomm wet suit bec pool session @ the Maya resort was very cold + I stayed cold until I got into full wet suit. Recommend taking extra session in Azteca pool (warmer) to learn about filling and emptying mask underwater and learn about ear clearing for underwater presure adjustment: 3-members of our 1st dive group could not adjust ears to under water pressure and/or could not clear mask of water so did not make their first dive + would have done so with (a) smaller group (3 or less for 1st dive) and (b) better advance preparation done in Azteca pool before open water dive and (c) more familiarity with equipment in advance of open water dive. Ask lots of questions during trial sessions in Azteca pool. During the free 1st session: learn mask clearing, buddy breathing, basic underwater signals (there are 11) and the proper way to put on and use the gear. Learn these in advance of proceeding to book the basic training and 1st open water dive. Snorkelling tour with the dive guys highly recommended too. Beach sand is clean, white perfection for long walks for miles in both directions at any hour of the day. Bring sand bucket + shovel for sand sculptures (premium sand). Beach and ocean front best in area: no rocks, debris or sharp objects in water. Shade cabannas were plentiful were for those who wanted to shade-bathe! Fellow guests were mostly European and Canadian families. Bring own shampoo and conditioner and favourite bath soap: hotel-supplied shampoo and shower gel adequate but not luxurious. On-site store carried all the essentials for most comfort needs. Food good and more than adequate. Mexican and itialian dinner buffets were the best (Italian-owned resort) and breakfast and lunch were excellent buffets. Service excellent. Staff appreciative of even small tips ($2USD). Christmas and New Years dinners at buffet were magnificent: very remarkable. Children all loved their choices of foods at every buffet meal. Sufficient variety to please every taste except fussy gourmet. Other guest reported ferry ride to Cozumel island was fun but quickly returned, finding nothing of interest on Cozumel island (very busy cruise ship stop over locale). Local bus/taxis to Coba, Tulum and other sites cheapest way to explore historic sites, since taxi cost and admission fees to sites are cheap. Group tours were no guarantee of sucess: we encountered low quality Tulum tour guide (and were crammed into old van) w sexual harassment jokes (who failed to change his conduct on being asked and warned by us) and less-than expected knowledge of Tulum (he talked a bit about Mayan culture and repeatedly of Mayan calendar, not much about the site of Tulum except the \"snake\" wall and four points of interest - I tuned him out after his third comment re his divorce troubles so he may have siad more than I heard. NB: I am family law lawyer. Teenagers and adults were insulted and discomfitted by the tour guide): tour guide ruined our Tulum trip and we made complaint to SunWing rep that has not yet been resolved (cost was about $95USD per sperson for party of 12) If we had taken local taxi/van and paid our own entrance fees, cost would likely have been $22USD per person. Take own guidebook or internet articles to site for reference. Internet access $5USD per hour or $60USD per week: take the weekly fee! Cotton hoodies @ $15 to $18USD and cotton blankets and back packs @ $20 to $23USD were our favorite \"good deals\" as were $2 to $3USD cotton braided bracelets. Silver jewellery in airport market (duty-free shopping area inside secure departure lounge) was better quality (eg: well-made lovely silver crosses $23 to $75USD, unique silver chains priced by weight) and better prices than what I saw locally. Silver jewellery sold locally appeared to be lesser quality: design, workmanship and finishing not up to high standards I observed 3-years ago in Playa del Carmen + among beach vendors. Beware of street vendor prices in Play del Carmen: know average base price for the item you want and don't go above that price unless the item has some unique appeal for you. Airport food very expensive: take extra croissants and fruit from the resort buffet to avoid $75USD hamburger w fries + pop \"meal\" for 4 family members. Airport water was $4.30USD for small bottle.

Taking into consideration the lower cost (about 25%) of this resort compared to the likes of a Riu Palace or Iberostar, this property ranks right up there. It is not fancy - you will not see the deep rich carpet, carved woodwork, or good art work on display like you might at a more expensive resort. The Azteca doesn't pretend to be fancy either. They spend all their efforts providing service and making sure their guest are comfortable and having a good time - for the most part. I have rated this a 4 instead of the 5 the property itself deserves solely because of their dishonest practice of trying to trick guest into wasting time with their fake concierge staff. See \"DISLIKES.\" SERVICE: Fast and friendly. Hard to find a front desk staff that goes out of their way to be helpful, but this was an exception. Thinks it helps to be friendly towards them too. I dropped them a notch in the service rating because they do not provide drink service at the bars, pool or beach. They do have someone going around to pick up empties all the time, but for a fresh drink, I had to pry my inebriated butt out of the chair and belly up to the bar. Every bartender was friendly and made good drinks to individual taste. Good brands and variety of liquors available if you asked for them with the exception of scotch (Highland Mist only). FOOD: Above average. We did not always like what we tried, but we always found something we liked. Did not have as large of variety at buffet as some other resorts, but it was enough. Tried all three a la carte restaurants and found them to be above average. Serving size was small, but enough. Only being able to make 3 reservations for a stay of 7 nights was a PITA, but them da rules. Food was always available at the pool bar and grill whenever the buffet was closed. Way above average food too. As noted by others, the pizza was the best we have ever had at an A.I. It was nice to be able to get a freshly made coffee there at all times too. Early risers at a Riu have to wait until 7:AM to get a cup of coffee. The buffett at the sister resort Maya is a little different and was a nice change for those who tire of Azteca's spread. You can also use your allocated evening reservations at the Maya too. BEACH/LOCATION: Very secure location inside of the guarded gate community of Playacar less than a 10 minute bike ride (provided at no extra charge) from 5th Ave. Side-by-side with other resorts against the beach, straight across the water from Cozmel. Great looking beach, but wave action of the freshly restored beach has left a steep 2 foot bank just off shore. Lots of broken coral and shells the first 20 feet into the water. A couple of days we noticed a strange smell to the ocean water. Plenty of lounge chairs on the beach or under the trees and grass roofed huts back off the beach. POOL: Large enough for this smaller resort even though it only has the one pool. Water was very cold so not much adult use of the pool while we were there. No swim up bar. Kept spotlessly clean, it was beautiful when lit up at night. Lounge chairs here, at the beach or under the trees were always available. Be warned that the pool deck was dark and slippery at night. ROOMS: Our room, #2300 was the best in the resort (we also paid an extra $400 for it too). One of the few that were ocean front with a great view of the ocean and beach. Being on the corner we had good views in 2 directions. We had a balcony large enough for a table and chairs. A nice whirlpool in the bathroom. Mini bar was stocked daily with drinks including brewskies. Coffee maker with the fixins, electronic safe, bathrobes and slippers in the closet. Most rooms do not have all this. Mini-fridges do not usually have beer. Views from most of the other ocean front rooms are mostly blocked by the trees though they do have the larger balcony too. All the standard rooms are angled towards the ocean and central courtyard-pool area, but the view of the ocean is mostly blocked by the trees. Balconies on these rooms are just large enough to stand on, no room to sit. We heard no complaints about any of the rooms. Our room was kept clean (though we did see nearly microscopic critters crawling on the dresser by the balcony door. Commode closet with it's own door was very small, rest of the bath was large. Bed very comfortable. 40\" LCD TV built into the wall. Located on highest of floor of 3 floors, there were times we wished that there was an elevator, but the view made up for having to climb the stairs several times each day. ACTIVITY STAFF: There were activities scheduled through the day, but most people were there to relax and enjoy the sun. The Staff did a good job of trying to get people involved but suffered from a lack of participation. OTHER FACILITIES: Tennis court - located on the roof of one of the buildings had a weird fake grass surface providing strange bounces that let my wife beat me. Sports bar - a joke. Only open from 6:PM until 2:AM, the bar area had no service, no drinks. One TV, one pool table, and 2 foosball tables. It did not cost anything to play pool or Foosball which was nice. Bicycles - could checkout for 3 hours at no extra charge. These are the old style, one gear bikes. They also provide a cable lock to secure your bike if you are away from it. Water activities - kayak, wind surfing, snorkeling, hobby craft sail boats provided at no extra charge. We took a sail boat a couple of times which was fun even though we could only have it for 30 minutes at a time. Had to pass a test before we could take it by ourselves. I felt they were a little overprotective of their water craft because some days they were not allowing them out when I could see sailboats from other resorts sailing by. Sigh. Theater - nightly, good lighting and sound. Shows are done by the activities staff and are hit or miss. Mostly a lot of dancing and poor lip syncing. I liked the comedy show, my wife liked the some of the others. DISLIKES: Not being able to take sailboats out when I see guest from other resorts sailing. I also very much disliked how the Wyndham's concierge staff acted helpful and tried to get us to their office so they could, \"give you a free gift to show our appreciation and tell you where everything is in this resort.\" All they do is try to get you to join their VIP Vacation Club. Keep in mind: \"There is NOTHING free in Mexico.\" Just keep telling them no and after a couple of days they stop asking. You are under no obligation to listen to their presentation. If we never return to this resort, this will be the reason why. I am amazed that the Wyndham management is willing to loose business for this kind of BS. I recommend this property but with the warning to stay away from the concierge staff.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cVIVA WYNDAM\u201d", "Author": "johnnyboy58", "ReviewID": "UR89381390", "Content": "Just got back from a great vacation at this resort .

My friend Tim and I stayed at the Viva Azteca in August 2010 just on a 4 day vacation. As a disclaimer - we are two laid back guys who enjoy the simple things. When we arrived at the Azteca we were told to book our dinner reservations at the service desk. They said since we only had booked 3 nights we could only make reservations for one restaurant but with a little convincing we were able to get 2 restaurants. Our room was regularly cleaned throughout our stay and the cleaning staff was always polite. We made it a point to speak as much Spanish as possible even though we know very little. The staff was amazing. Very polite, helpful and as two very easy going people, I'm sure it was a relief from all the demanding families that were around. We made friends with a lot of the staff, mainly Edilberto and Nelson. If they are still there, we're coming back next year just for you! Every night they set up a martini table in the \"town square\" where they mix fresh martinis of different flavors. Edilberto let us jump behind the bar and make our own. The beach and water were beautiful. Though there isn't much drink service on the beach it isn't far at all from the bar/pool. We booked an excursion through Yvonne with BestDay Travel and she was more than helpful. Also made use of the jet ski rentals on the beach which we were able to haggle down the price. We took a walk down the road to the sister resort (Maya) which was ok but too many kids running around. I think that one is more family oriented, it did have a swim up bar though which we made use of one day. The drinks are what you expect at an allinclusive - Good, fruity, not too strong. Only had Dos Equis on tap which was fine by us. They don't have any top shelf liquor so plan to have beer or mixed drinks. They have a list of cocktails at every bar and we made a point of trying all of them (I suggest the melon ball). The restaurants were great. We had the Mayan restaurant and the Italian. At the Mayan, I recommend the raw salmon salad - amazing. At the Italian, the filet was great. We didn't do much of the hotel activities because they were in the morning. We checked out the evening show one night which was ok but our attention spans could only take so much. To sum up, this place had everything we were looking for. I wouldn't say everyone would enjoy it. It is not a college party resort or a family resort either. It is more relaxed and family friendly but it's what you make of it.

Your mileage-may-vary... WHAT WAS EXCEPTIONAL 1) The grounds - fabulous. The best of any we've been to. Really liked the \"town square\" concept. 2) The beach. White sand, no rocks. 3) The resort is small, so it has a more intimate feel. The beach is 4 minutes walk, you don't need a bus-ride. 4) Easy walk to Playa Del Carmen. Take a bike if you don't want to walk. WHAT WAS GOOD 1) The room. Basic. Standard. 2) The specialty restaurants. Oriental... wasn't really. Italian was great. Mayan was OK. 3) Many (many) guests were European. Nice to have a mix, not just all Canadians or Americans. 4) Buffet. Same as every other 3/4 star resort. Dead boring, but completely predicatble and we didn't hear of one case of food poisoning the entire week. WHAT WAS BELOW STANDARD 1) Service. We tried to change a restaurant booking and ended up in a verbal jousting match when we arrived for the meal and found it had been \"accidentally cancelled\". 2) Entertainment. The Animation was OK (same as everwhere) and the team worked hard. What was missing was any sort of entertainment in the bar/common area. There was one brief keyboard player session on one night. In the bar area/central square there were no musicians, no shows, nothing (it was crying out for a mariachi band). Quiet. Kinda dead. 3) Smoking. Because of the high percentage of Europeans, smoking in public areas was much more prevalent than we\u2019ve found in other resorts. To the point of being annoying a couple of times. WHAT REALLY SUCKED AT THE AZTECA Nothing. It was a quiet, utterly predictable vacation in a nice spot. WHAT REALLY SUCKED ABOUT THE VACATION 1) This is NOT the Aztec's fault, but all of Playa Del Carmen feels wierd to us now because of the hotel that blew up a few km away while we were there. I have no idea what to think about the cause, but it has tainted this area (and maybe all of Mexico) for us. Not sure if we will go back. 2) The touts on 5th Avenue.

We arrived in Mexico at Cancun airport and took the ADO bus to Playa del Carmen. After that we took a taxi to the hotel; which unless you have baggage is really unnecessary since the hotel is right down the road. We checked in and made our reservations for the fine dining restaurants and proceeded to our room. We put the key in, opened the door and there was already someone sleeping in bed. We asked the nearest service person and they let us into the next room to call the front desk. After a few minutes from when he left we realized the room we were in was a HUGE upgrade. For the confusion they let us keep the upgrade! The service at the resort is impeccable! The snack bar was the best part of the resort with burgers, pizza, guacamole, fruit and other misc. food; you could eat there almost any time of day and all through the night. Depending upon which room you have you can also get room service-we were able to but never utilized it. The two restaurants we chose to make reservations at were the mayan and asian. Both were mildly disappointing as far as taste and variety but it was a nice atmosphere and change from the buffet. It was also very nice because they would go to the bar and get a new drink for you if asked. The buffet had different themes throughout the week but also kept the same foods as well. Some of the themes were italian(pastas), asian(stir fry), and tex mex(tacos and enchiladas). I personally liked the buffet but by the end of the week we started to get inventive and make things like BLT sandwiches and such. Every night outside of the buffet area they featured drinks. One night was flavored tequilas, daiquiris, martinis, and margaritas. This made it so you did not have to leave the buffet area when you wanted a drink(although not far away) because the servers would bring it to you. The bars would make anything you want and by the second day we figured out who we like make our drinks. There were a total of two bars. One by the pool and one by the lounge area. We spent most of the time going to the one by the pool because it is a short walk to the beach. The resort's beachfront was the cleanest there. We spent much time walking down the beach and looking at other resorts one evening and was very pleased with ours. Every night they brought in the beach chairs and organized them. On the final night of our stay they actually stacked all of the chairs up and grated the beach to make it nice and soft; I would assume this is done once a week. When looking at the two Vivas. The Viva Wyndham Maya is more of a younger crowd. More partying and very much louder. I am only 25 but wanted a relaxing vacation and when my husband and I went to the Maya I got very agitated and wanted to leave. The food is not different at the snack bar and the drinks were made better at the Azteca. Also, the Maya is a little further from Playa del Carmen so the walk may be further. Azteca was about a ten minute walk at a steady pace and the scenery along the way is beautiful.", "Date": "October 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing small resort\u201d", "Author": "robert1164", "ReviewID": "UR83758523", "Content": "Good location in Playacar, 15 min walk to Playa del Cramen.

AWESOME TOUR GUIDE!\u201d", "Author": "lmdj517", "ReviewID": "UR80090338", "Content": "My husband and I traveled to Mexico in July of 2010. It was our first time to Mexico and also our first time at an all-inclusive resort. The hotel and rooms are very nice. Everything is in walking distance. My only complaints about the room were that there was very little storage space for clothes and the bed was on the harder side although I hear that is a common trend in Mexico. We stayed for 6 days and that was plenty for us. Although there was a huge variety at the buffet and the food was decent, I wish they would stick with what they know rather than try to incorporate theme nights, such as Italian and BBQ, to appease the tourists. Part of what we enjoy when we go on vacation is trying the authentic and different food of the area, but that just did not happen here. So maybe we are just not cut out for all-inclusive places. We did eat at the Mayan ala carte restaurant one night which was quite good; however, we were limited to only selecting one of the ala carte restaurants due to our length of stay. There are also Italian and Japanese restaurants on the property and you also have privileges at the sister Wyndham property which is a few resorts down. All of the workers on the property were very diligent and friendly. Some worked from sunrise until after sunset. They are all very hard working and happy to please. The pool area is on the smaller side and people do go down early and put towels on chairs. We are beach people though and we never had any problems getting lounge chairs on the beach. The beach is very nice and kept very clean of seaweed. As you walk along the beach you will see that there is more seaweed on the beach. The water is beautiful and was pretty calm while we were there. We walked to the very large market place that is right outside the gates of Playa del Carmen. There are some high end stores on the one end then seemingly endless souvenir stores. Some of the people there do heckle you to try to get you to come in their stores and buy something which I was not fan of. The other thing was that many of the stores sold the same mass-produced souvenirs which disappointed me. There are some smaller stores here and there that sell unique items, but I guess it depends on what you are looking for. Our best day in Mexico by far was when we took a private tour with Adrian Perez! We first went snorkeling in the Caribbean and saw several sea turtles from only a few feet away! Because there is also a barrier reef there, we saw plenty of fish and other creatures! That part by itself was amazing. Then we went snorkeling at a cenote, which is part of an underground river system. It was truly a discovery channel type of experience and something we will never forget. It is very quiet and dark inside so much so that we had to take lights with us but very serene and beautiful at the same time. We then went to a Mexican restaurant for lunch close to Coba. The food was absolutely amazing and I wish I could have ate that food the whole time we were there! I had a chicken dish and my husband had pork with rice and all the fixings along with guacamole and hand pressed fresh tortillas which were out of this world! We then had a tour of Coba which is one of the Mayan ruin sites in the area. It is in a rainforest so we walked some and also rode bicycles to parts. We were able to climb one of the ancient pyramids there as well with an incredible view at the top! Adrian was an amazing guide and I am very thankful that someone else recommended him through Trip Advisor so that we were able to find him! He is very friendly and easy going and also speaks English, Spanish and French. He has a website but it is in French. His email address is: viajes.conciencia@gmail.com. He only does private tours and works completely from recommendations. He offers several different tours that he can send information on to you, but he is also willing to do ala carte type tours depending on what you are interested in doing. Our tour was a combination of two and it worked out very well. His prices are very reasonable and not much more than the tour bus tours. Plus you have the flexibility with him to spend as much time as you want doing each part. Lunch, snacks and drinks are also included in the price. I would highly highly recommend him to anyone looking to go on a tour while there! It was truly an unforgettable experience!

I did not expected as many great things as I got. My friend was here also and she was the one who strongly recomended it to us. To make the long story as short as possible, here is my review. Everything and I mean everything was great. People who work there are extremely nice and professional, every single day our room was cleaned spotless and we are not messy people, they even washed our little balcony and windows of whatever was there. So the service was amazing, anything we asked for was delivered and our representative from Apple Vacation was the nicest men ever, who took care of everything, by the way his name was Ian and we strongly approve his services to enyone. Food on the other side was too much, whoever writes that it was not enough and not good is insane! We could not handle the variety and deliciousness of all we wanted to try especialy the lunches were fabulous, we loved all the restaurants alla carte and the all night buffet was helpfull as well. Meantime the whole young crew from Animation and Sports at the beach was so entertaining we could not believe, they did so many things all day and at the and of the day they still had so much energy to provide us with the night entertainment in the theater, just plain crazy! I don't know how these guys did it and it was hot as hell, but they did it and in the morning around 7 or 8 AM they were already there to have breakfast with us and to keep us company, loved it! The management of this hotel is beyond, we haven't had not even one small problem with anyting, and if I would have to pick one bad thing it would be that we could not stay longer in this great hotel, besides we had such a great time meeting our Polish friends from Germany that it was even harder to live this piece of paradise In the Carribean, we know 100% we will go back to Viva Wyndham Azteca and we don't even want to go to any other hotel, and we have been to Mexico more than 6 times, but that is another story...

CAR Upon arrival at the air port, we were greeted by our car rental agency-it was all inclusive too, we were wisked to the off site lot and given our car. The car was $224 for 5 days all inclusive, meaning that all insurances were included. Keep in mind that a shuttle is pricey and you have great freedom with your own car and parking is free at the hotel. One problem with the car. It did not have a front liscense plate and we were pulled over and the kids could not find seat belts so I was given an offer I could not refuse-Pay the police station $100 or pay the cop $16 on the spot. Which did I choose? Hmmmm Hotel Upon entering the hotel, it was clear that we we not in an upscale resort. They did not offer the customary welcome drink and warm moist towel for refreshing. The check-in went well, the bags were delivered to the room. The grounds were beautiful and very well maintained and clean. The beach was great, plenty of white sand and blue chairs. The pool was alive with people and drinks flow 24/7. There was very little drink service, it was self serve, meaning we had to go to the bar and order drinks, but I am ok with that. The food was plentifull-something to eat 24/7. The main food was served at the buffet, but there were other restaurantes but required reservations. I don't get along with with reservations on vacation, so we settled for the buffet. Entertainment The entertainment or animation team was absolutly amazing. They work from 8am -12am and are enviously busy and skinny. There are plenty of scheduled activities. Every evening, there was a childrens show, where the children were involved, followed by an adult show-great fun. Dancing followed the adult show under the theater at the main bar until midnight. The hotel offered a shuttle service to a night club every night for the night owls who dont have kids. The hotel offered many excersions to all the popular destinations. If you have a car, you can go to wal mart and buy excursions cheaper or simply drive to the sites yourself. The hotel was full of people from all over the world. There were many families with children of all ages-so the kids had friends and there is a functioning kids club on site- free too. Overall, the experience was great.

The room and the hotel were very clean and well kept. The location was pretty good. It was a short 5 minute $4 cab ride to get into Playa del Carmen. The beach was very nice. We never had a problem getting beach chairs. We didn't really hang out at the pool so I can't comment on it, except that there was one glaring omission...a swim up bar. The bed and pillows in the room were extremely uncomfortable. We had them add the mattress pad which helped with the bed comfort a bit but the the pillows just made getting a good sleep impossible. The food at the buffet was pretty average at best. Eating the same buffet three times a day really got old after a few days. They changed the theme each night for dinner, but you were really just getting the same stuff just prepared in a slightly different way. Also, the buffet area is not air conditioned which made it a bit uncomfortable for the time of year we were there. We didn't eat at any of the a la carte places so I can't comment on them. As for the drinks, beer and wine were flowing unlimited all day which was good. Their frozen drinks could have passed as virgin they were so weak. It was laughable watching them make the drinks and literally dribble a small amount of alcohol in them. The mixed drinks served on the rocks were better. If you asked the bartender for his \"special\" you'd usually get a fairly strong drink. If you stay at the Azteca you also have access to everything at the Maya. However, the Maya is four resorts down the beach and is a good 10-15 walk along the beach or the road from the Azteca. The overall atmosphere of the resort was fairly relaxed which was just what we were looking for. The entertainment group would get a few things going during the day which you could join in on if you wanted, but they didn't get in the way of those, like us, who just wanted to relax and enjoy the beach. All in all considering what it cost us to stay at the Azteca I'd say we got what we paid for. If I had to do it all over again I would have upped our budget a few hundred dollars and stayed somewhere else where the food was better, the beds were more comfortable and there was a swim up bar.

The room was simple but clean and comfortable. Everything worked properly. Housekeeping was great. They did what we asked them to do. They did not come in the room when we put out the sign \"Please do not disturb\". The bed was comfortable for us since we like a firm bed. The safety deposit box came handy. We always kept our valueables there just in case, but we did not have any problems with theft. The staff were very helpful all the time. The beach was nice with lots of palapas and chairs. We had no problem finding an empty chair. The ocean was beautiful turquoise as you see it on postcards. I could not take my eyes off the water. What beauty! The only problem with the beach was that there were huge sand bags in the ocean to protect the beach. They did not look very nice but they do serve a purpose. A hurrican a few years ago destroyed the beach and thanks to these sand bags the beach looks great again. The location was unbelievable! We were in Playacar (the hotel zone) which is a gated area. It was very safe. We walked a lot outside the hotel. It was a 10 minute walk or $5 cab ride to Playa del Carmen - an amazing town with souvenir shops, bars, restaurants and lots of fun. We went there almost every night. We took a cab most of the time since it was too hot and humid for a long walk. There was a small shopping plaza about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. That was a nice place as well although the prices were higher there. Playa del Carmen is the place to buy souvenirs etc. The pool was small and crowded, and the water was too warm to refresh in it. But don't forget that we were there in July. So we went in the ocean a lot. The food was not the best. Most of the time we ate at the buffet. We are vegetarian so we could not find a big variety of selection for ourselves. The first two days the food seemed OK but then it became repetitive and bland. We did have dinner in the Italian restaurant which was much better, but you have to make a reservation for that in advance. We wanted to make reservations for the other Italian restaurant, but it was open only on the weekends. So just make sure you are familiar with the hours of operations. We also visited the other Viva Wyndham resort which was a 5 minute walk. The food was the same there, but there were more restaurants there as well. So overall it was a good place to say for the money. There are good and bad sides of it so you have to weigh the pros and cons. If you can get a great deal, it is definitely a good place to say.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cIf you like sweating and are not a drinker you will like this!\u201d", "Author": "Dallas73", "ReviewID": "UR74549226", "Content": "The room was bare, only 2 drawers and 6 hangers were available.

I probably would not recommend this hotel for a couple but for our family of 7 ( kids ages 9-19) it had all we could hope for. Check in was a little rough as we had requested adjoining rooms for our daughters and none were available until two days later. The first rooms we were assigned were the furthest from the beach and pool and they were on the first floor and very musty and dark. We did get to change to the second floor right away but did not get the adjoining rooms until the third day. The rooms are not the best but we were really only n there to sleep and shower so you have to put that into perspective. THey are very clean and that is one or biggest criteria. The food was not great but you cannot expect to have the American food that you are accustomed to in the states. If you keep an open mind, you certainly can find enough to sustain you and besides you don't go to Mexico to belly up to the buffet. The drinks are a little on the weak side but they did serve Dos Equis beer which was good and every night they serve special martinis through the dinner hour. Our kids must have had 100 non-alcoholic strawberry daiquiries. The snack bar is great, our kids could get whatever they wanted all day long and we did not have to take them to Iunch which was nice. I have to say the best thing that this hotel offers is the entertainment. Our kids were entertained non stop the entire stay. This was a huge bonus given that we have boys ages 9, 10, and 12. The sports and entertainment group are young and full of energy and put on quite a show at night. Its not Vegas or NYC but they work very hard to put together shows. If you have kids, you have to go to Mini Disco! Our boys competed every night and have great memories of all that they did. I do suggest that you go on an excursion that your transfer company may offer (ours was Bestday.com)We chose one of the Mayan Adventures which was our second time and it was amazing. (Snorkel, zipline, rappel) As far as shopping goes, you might be disappointed in going to Playa del Carmen, we didn't find anything great but the small shopping center within the Playacar complex was perfect for souvenirs and all that they have to offer is much closer than going into town. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for a family. As a couple, I would pick something more upscale and exclusive but this did work for us even though I was initially disappointed but soon realized that the location was excellent. The beach was amazing and the view spectacular. We did not see a lot of American tourist there on our stay, alot of Europeans which are mostly rude but its all in the experience and we did not see hardly any tipping which did not surprise me from them! We tipped a lot and think that $100 in ones goes along way between the maid for the room, bar tenders and wait staff and transportion. They all work very hard and they don't make alot of money. The advertisements say that tipping is included, but very rarely does the resort pay out tips to the workers.

Not a lot of storage, so expect to live out of your suitcase. We were a bit surprised that they only leave a few sodas and water bottles in the mini-fridge, and if you want more water, you have to give up the sodas. Just take your water bottles to the pool bar and refill there. Overall, the food was very good. They made an effort to provide variety in the buffett by having a different theme every night. On the grill night, they had an entire leg of beef suspended over the charcoal grill, and the chef would slice off a steak and cook it to order right there. We've been to several AI's, and the buffet is never the high-point of the experience, but, all-in-all, we rated this buffet as quite good. The Italian restaurant was fabulous - one of the best meals we've had. Our sons raved about it. The Mayan restaurant was okay, and the dishes were interesting. The oriental restaurant was just average, at best. The snack bar at the pool cranked out an endless supply of quite good pizzas Staff were super friendly and helpful. We were almost the only Americans at the resort the week we stayed, and we were the only ones we saw tipping. The staff almost seemed surprised when we did, but they worked hard to make everyone happy, regardless. The beach was great, and tended constantly. A wide expanse of sand, backing up to plenty of shade provided by palapas and coconut trees. There were plenty of lounges, but you did have to go down and claim your territory early if you wanted one of the best spots. The on-beach animacion workers were very active, organizing games. One even climbed a coconut tree, harvested several coconuts and opened them for everyone to sample. The location is good - not very far south from Playa del Carmen. We didn't try, but it looked like you could walk into town on the beach, although it would be a bit of a hike. We visited the neighboring Viva Maya resort so that one of our sons could try the trapeze there, which he thought was a blast. Some others have complained about the techno music played rather loudly at the pool, but this seems to be the standard at all resorts. We stayed on the beach and did not find it offensive.

About the beach in front of the hotel, it's really very beautiful and not much crowded, and the music from the bar is not loudy like in other hotels in playacar. I have only a negative point to report, not strictly related to the hotel but to a company named \"Scuba Caribe\" that organizes dive and snorkeling tours in this area, they have an office on the beach just in front of the hotel. I said to the guy that I was interested to do snorkeling in the Cozumel island, and then he proposed me an half-day tour that included the visit of three different reefs with a total time of 3 hours of snorkeling time. I took that tour but immediately realized that i was cheated. The total snorkeling time was around an hour, and the time spent on the 2nd and 3rd reef was ridicolous, only 15 minutes per reef. I complained with the guide and I was told that there was not time enough. Another thing they didn't mention when I paid was that the tour is not exclusive because both groups of snorkeling and diving are together in the same boat, this is a mess because they need to move continuosly the boat to reach different points. But of course, after lunch, they could find the time (30 minutes) to sell the video shooted under water during the dive sessions\u2026 I have reported this episode to the hotel and submitted an official complaint but I did't get any reply so far: this is a pity because the hotel's reputation gets low as long as this kind of episodes occur, in fact \"scuba caribe\" makes use of the hotel swimming pool to give some demos on diving.

The hotel has theme nights which is always fun and each night they have a different entertainment show. From one of the previous post, I saw that their air conditioning didn't work. However, everything is in celsius, so if she had it on 50, then the air would never turn on. Turn your AC to 15 or 20 and you'll be good. It worked great.

They had a martini bar set up outside in the courtyard every night that many seemed to enjoy.

The pool, not as big as other hotels we stayed at but big enough, I loved the water arobics classes...No problems getting palapas around the pool (we are however early risers) The beach, spectacular, no big drops in front of the Azteca, they rake it daily and scoop up all the seaweed that washes in (not much but they clean it up) nice touch...

My husband found his favourite mixed drink and when the bar wasn't too busy they would have it ready for him as he approached the bar - Now that's great service. They also will make any drink you can think of... so have fun trying them out. Also the waiters at the buffet were exceptional. As soon as my plate was empty it disappeared and as soon as my glass got low it was refilled. I felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant. We were very impressed. We loved the hotel layout. There is a great centre plaza with a little fountain. It was our favourite spot in the evening as they put out a martini table with the evenings special (every night a new set of specialties). The room was basic but more than adequate. Very clean and the shower was always hot with great pressure. The concierge service was also great. On the third night we went to request a wake up call and the girl remembered our room number, which I must say was quite impressive. The beach is huge and gorgeous. You can walk down it to Playa De Carmen in 15 minutes. I also recommend walking to town by the street in Playacar since there is an awesome free ruins site. Food was also pretty good. Not every dish was great but there was enough to choose from that I found something I really liked every night. Each day of the week has a different theme so there is always a new variety to taste and choose from. The a la cart was also good. The food was nicely presented and service was quick. The red wine is better than the white. There is also a decent 24 hour snack bar... It was great since we got to the hotel quite late. TIP: Book all your a la carts as soon as you get in since they may fill up quick. The only draw back we had was by Sunquest. Their plane was late. Their bus broke down and we were forced to take taxis. And the Hotel's sunquest rep was not very nice. Instead of apologizing for the bus and all our trouble we got a lecture on not calling her at home, at night.. etc. very annoying! Also DO NOT take her recommendations on tour trips. Our 1st trip was a disaster. Ensure you request to go on \"cancun line.\" They provided an air conditioned bus (not crammed you in a van like sardines) and even provided free beer on the Chichen Itzha trip. The guides on the Cancun line were exceptionally superior to the recommended trip's guide, who was focused on selling us things instead of providing history and info. Cancun Line was so good we took 2 more excursions with them. Excursions: Chichen Itza, a 7th wonder of the world, is a large well preserved site and totally worth the long drive. Coba, though located in a hot jungle, is great for the more active because you can still climb it. And Tulumn has a nice beach area where you can swim and relax after the guided tour. All trips stopped at a Cenote (underground fresh water cave) where you got to swim and cool down before heading to the hotel. Overall, a wonderful experience.

The flight there was fine, although the wait upon arriving at the airport was very long to get through customs/immigration. We had r/t airport transfers through Best Day Travel (which was included in our vacation package), who were friendly and efficient . The ride to the resort took a while as we had 4 stops before us, but the return ride back to the airport was very quick as there was only one other couple in our shuttle. I would definitely recommend using them. Check-in at the Azteca was a breeze, although at that point it was 11:30 at night. Someone assisted us with our bags and we were offered a welcome drink. Our room was in an excellent location, near the pool and about 4 rooms from the ocean. We had a refrigerator stocked with water and soda, and the room was spacious. It was exactly what we had requested. The bed was on the firm side, which wasn't a problem for my husband and I since we like our mattress firm. The only problem we had was the A/C. It just didn't get the room cool enough, despite being as high as it would go. It seemed to max out at 78F. We were disappointed with the \"pool bar\" since it was quite a ways from the pool and the beach. We knew there wouldn't be a swim up bar, but I didn't expect the bar to be an entire flight of stairs away from the pool, and even further from the beach. However, the bartenders were efficient and served very good drinks. They'll use the good stuff if you ask. The snack bar was okay, although during lunch time there was always a line to get a hamburger from the grill and if you weren't there quickly you'd have to wait to get fries, pizza, or hot dogs. The food...well, it's not very good. It got very repetitive after a couple of days, and it seemed like it was the same thing every day. However, I can say the authentic Mexican dishes they served at the buffet were delicious. When they tried to \"Americanize\" something it failed miserably. Regardless, we always found something to eat and certainly didn't starve. The waitstaff was very prompt and friendly, clearing our plates right away and always with a smile. We did eat at the Mayan and Italian restaurants. They were adequate, although not much better than the buffet. Desserts were very tasty though, in both the sit-downs and the buffet. The homemade coconut ice cream in the buffet was probably my favorite thing to eat. The nightlife was pretty non-existent. We went into the Sports Bar after one of the shows, and it had the potential to be decent since it was air-conditioned, had a pool table, TV's and comfy seats, but there was NO ONE there...not even a bartender. We talked to a couple of other guests who didn't even know it was there! Most people sat in the lobby bar or courtyard, but we didn't see any dancing. A few nights there was a DJ setting up, although he must've started very late since we left at 11:30 and he hadn't started playing yet. We did go to a couple of shows, and they were just okay, although we weren't expecting much. Certainly not Vegas-quality, but enjoyable. Would've been nice if they started earlier in the evening. All of that sun and swimming really tires you out! The animation staff tried hard to get people involved, and would leave you alone if you didn't want to join in. The pool was very warm, and loaded with kids. On our last day there, there were quite a few unattended European kids (around age 10 I'd guess) that had taken over a section of the pool and were dumping their drinks into it. That was pretty nasty. Security walked by and didn't say anything, and their parents were no where to be found. I'm glad we left after that. The beach was gorgeous, and huge. If you have mobility problems that might be problematic as the chairs were a good ways from the ocean. The bad thing was the jet skis, which launched right next to the beach. The gas smell was very unappealing, and made it almost unbearable to be in the water too long. We did get a couples massage while we there, which was very good. I would definitely recommend the spa as they were professional, friendly, and not too expensive. The hotel itself was a great location, a quick 5 minute taxi ride to 5th Avenue. We had a couple of nights of going into town and visiting the different restaurants and bars. I can definitely see why people would choose not to go AI with all of the choices downtown. Overall this was a standard hotel. Our room was clean, quiet (except for the repetitive blasting music from the pool every afternoon), and the drinks were good. We only paid $600 a person, so we didn't expect much. What bumped this up from a 3 to a 4 IMHO was the service. Everyone was extremely friendly, from the waistaff, front desk, to bartenders. They even helped my husband get flowers delivered to me for my birthday, even though he doesn't speak a lick of Spanish. We probably wouldn't visit the Azteca again since there are so many other hotels to choose from in PDC, but I don't regret going there given what we paid. Don't expect a lot of frills, but if you're looking for a cheap AI getaway, I'd recommend the Azteca.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cThis place is awful.

You had to go to the egg stand, wait in line, and ask a person busy cooking to hand you some bacon - and then they gave you a small amount of cold, undercooked bacon, and handed your plate back to you. The beds were rock hard, and extremely uncomfortable. The walls were paper thin. My wife heard the neighbors drop a pencil. That's how thin they were. A constantly crying baby was, of course, loud and clear. The shows were embarrassing, like a junior high school dance recital. We didn't expect a five star performance, but it was pretty awful. The staff was intrusive. My wife and I were sitting eating dinner, and a staff member plops down in an empty chair at our table with his food and eats with us.

The rooms are dated (despite adding flat screen televisions during our stay) and the air conditioning is unsatisfactory. We moved rooms after the A/C was not producing only to find our next room had the same problem. Our group of friends all agreed that the rooms simply could not stay cool enough (approximately 78 degrees at its coolest). Gnats/Mosquitos in the rooms (as a result of the cleaning ladies leaving their doors open when visiting the rooms) were problematic as they bit us at night, and the odd smell of sewage occassionally eminating from the bathroom exhaust fan was unpleasant (and both were also experienced by others in our group). As previous guests have noted, the food is of poor quality. Indigestion was not uncommon from our group, and some items did not taste at all like you would expect them to (i.e., maple syrup tasting very odd, burgers tasting down right awful). We also tried to make reservations at one of the hotel restuarants only to be told, like other reviewers, that we had to make the reservation at the front desk and in-person (not by phone). We then learned there was no availability for three days, despite having been told earlier that reservations were only taken for the day of. We ultimately obtained a restaurant reservation by accompanying the bride-groom, whom we were traveling with, to one of their dinners and found the food (in Il Portofino at the Viva Maya) to be of much better quality than the regular buffet. Drinks at the hotel's several bars were readily available, including a nice variety of non-alcoholic options. However, the front desk seemed to be bothered when assistance was requested and the \"entertainment\" can best be described as extremely amateurish. Despite management at the facility regularly thanking guests for their reviews on Trip Advisor, no effort seems to have been made to address the repeated disappointments of past guests.

In the past, within the Playacar complex, I have stayed in Iberostar Tucan, Riu Playacar & Sandos. Personally for me, I would rate the Iberostar & Sandos as excellent with the Riu & Viva Wyndham Azteca as a notch below the other two. Viva Azteca is a \"no frills\" resort that is perfectly clean & adequate but does not exceed expectations except for this one important factor ~ THE BEST BEACH! There are no rocks, very little seaweed and beautiful soft white sand that stays cool to the feet even at 93 degrees. Facing the beach, we walked beyond Sandos~last resort to the right & to the Playa ferry~past last resort to the left. Issues in these directions included rocks and sand erosion. The beach in from of Azteca is perfect! That being said, our transportation was by Brandts Entertainment Plus. We use this every year because it is a direct transport to your resort for basically the same price as those included with a tour company ($105 R/T for two) without having to stop at multiple other resorts. No problems for arrival or departure and friendly, professional drivers. Check in was a breeze and our room was 10 steps to pool and maybe 50 steps to ocean. My only complaint would be regarding the refrigerator ~ you received ONE bottle of water daily and two sodas. When we called the desk for more water we were told we would have to \"trade\" our soda for more water. REALLY?? This is an all inclusive resort after all! Also, because I read other reviews we knew to bring our own face cloths because there were none left for us. On day two when we had some towel art on one bed, it included a facecloth. Not a big deal to us. We did play the morning towel game to get the primo spot with the ocean breeze by the pool. Our towels were placed at 6:30 am and we were not the first to do so. It is wise to get clean beach towels at the end of each day for this purpose. While they do have the card system in place for the beach towels, we were able to get two each with little coaxing. Pool water temp raises drastically by afternoon and there was a green line of algae along the water line. By the last day of our trip the pool needed a good shock because it was completely cloudy. The ocean, however was perfect every day with light waves and refreshing temps. Now for the food....We stuck to the basics of eggs & fruit for breakfast. Yes, there was moldy leftover ham at the omlet station every morning so beware! Yes, there was leftover cut up hot dogs served for breakfast. For lunch we had freshly grilled fabulous fish & a salad and for dinner it was fish & veggies again. There was only one buffet restaurant and there was no diet pepsi the entire length of our trip, we settled for seltzer water. For dinner there was always a fresh fish or chicken choice. While this may not please some, we were never left hungry. I suggest skipping the desserts and thats all I will say on that! We did not reserve any dinners at the restaurants by our own choice. We had one dinner on Fifth Ave in Playa at Jonny Rockets. The reason we stay in Playacar is due to its proximity to Fifth Ave. Many guests we spoke to were apprehensive to go there and in my opinion they are really missing out! We went every night & felt perfectly safe at all times. No worries! :) In closing, this resort is perfect for the bargain price. We paid $650 each for 5 nights including airfare from Hartford. Guests staying right next door at the Riu Palace most likely paid at least double for the same fantastic beach. No doubt, this is my favorite vacation destination.

The resort is older however, don't be fooled. The staff, who are amazing, kept it impeccable and were always cleaning, and never missed a beat to look up and smile and say \"ola\". One thing to keep in mind, the front desk is very rigid. There is no such thing as a late check out or early check out; we spent many hours of our last day playing a back and forth game with the front desk about leaving later. They should just be up front and say that they don't offer it. In any case, the only negative things I can say about our stay in Mexico were the few too frequent pushes for time shares (when you get off the plane, if you're rerouted to a guy at the counter at the airport, it's only to inform you that the Azteca doesn't support the local economy due to it being owned by a Spanish organization; the way I look at it, it had to be one of the heaviest employed resorts I've been to, so I would argue that one!). And on the ride to the hotel, I wasn't very impressed with the driver and his side kick selling beers (and drinking them too!) on the way to the hotel because they don't make enough! I wasn't thrilled with my driver doubling up as a bar tender; hence, the ride from the airport was excessively long, 2 hours! In future, we're cabbing it. Those were our negatives...the rest... The staff at the resort, from wait staff, to cleaning staff, were amazing. The food was fantastic, whenever they put on \"Mexican night\" ensure to participate, the food was awesome those two evenings, just wonderful! We went to the Mexican A-la carte restaurant and would have to agree, a better choice of wines is needed, but the food was ok but not as good as the Mexican night but the waiters at the Mexican restaurant were amazing. The beach: it was gorgeous with the exception of one day where the ocean seemed to have spit out a bunch of shells and fragments of them. Could this be from the building up of the beach? the water was amazing, plenty of loungers but still recommended that wherever you decide to spend your day (pool or beach) you need to get up at dawn to ensure that the chair you'd like is reserved with your towel. By 6:30 am there are slim pickings if any chairs by the pool. The Azteca is an older resort, but is kept amazingly clean, you won't regret it. It's a great little resort with a heck of alot of character! We enjoyed it tremendously. We walked to Playa del Carmen a few times (easier at night, alot cooler!) we walked along the roadway and along the beach, both are gorgeous walks and only about 20 minutes (remember it was about 30-35 degrees C during that time...the weather was amazing!). Playa del Carmen was very busy and once you've covered the first 2 blocks or so, everything else down the strip is just repetitive; the wares seem to be identical it's a matter of being yelled at, almost accosted at times by vendors and then there are the \"tour\" fellows with their lewd little comments. Can't say that other than the great little bar with amazing salsa, that Playa del Carmen was enjoyable. Not our cup of tea. Don't expect a huge selection of tv channels, but then again, nobody goes away to watch tv. The entertainment staff were all young and energetic even in that heat and always took \"no thank you\" graciously. They're all very approachable and very sweet. One recommendation: if hard beds aren't your thing, bring a mattress pad/cover to help. We used the extra blanket in the room and folded it over to act as a \"cushion\" on the mattress, but the end of the week, we definitely were missing our bed back home!!! The only other negative, would be Sunwing. The flight back home was delayed several times and we would have hoped that some accommodations would have been made due to the delay so in the least, but they weren't. We went from a 2am arrival to an 8am arrival and no sleep for a good 24+hours nor was an explanation or apology offered. We were exhausted upon our return. We would return to Azteca any time with a smile on our faces, but I would avoid Sunwing. In the end, it was our first trip to Mexico and like I stated earlier, we would go again in a millisecond, the great resort, staff, food, beach and weather made it an incredible getaway.

Made our way to our room through very nicely decorated and landscaped paths. Room was exactly as expected...clean and frankly a bit utilitarian, but very comfortable. Spent some time getting the lay of the land and sample some of the watering holes in the hotel. The pool bar serves food buffet style from 10am or so to 6am. Quite predictable and limited selection but always hot and plentiful and there was always lots of fresh fruit. We tried all the a la carte restaurants and found them all very good. Not the biggest portions but certainly very high caliber quality. Only suggestion would be that they offer something other than the two 'house wines'. The wine itself was ok, but it would be nice to have some variety, even if we had to pay for it. The main restaurant was very good. Lots of hot, fresh food with a large seclection of different things. If you can't find something you like, you're a bit too picky. Even had areas of low fat, low sodium selections. One must sample the nightly maritini bar selections which is directly in front of the restaurant. Pool and beach areas were awesome. Impeccabley clean. Pool deck can be a bit slippery but there are always staff present with squeegies (sp?) getting rid of the wet spots. But get your beach chairs reserved early in the day - like 7am for the prime spots. From 3pm to 6pm or so, there is constant organized activity at the pool area. The emmcee, Rubin, is hilarious to say the least. We chose the excusion the Chichen Izza which is a must see. Very long day as it's three or so hours away but worth every minute. Two things though that absolutely made our time there outstanding, to the point we will return, is first the room we had....on the east side of the pool, ground level and right beside the pool. Perfect location! Ten steps to the pool deck. The second thing, and we can't say enough good about them, is the staff. We have never seen a group of people try sooooo hard to make sure everyone has a good time. Exceedingly polite, friendly and fun to be around. They are not pushy in terms of soliciting you to be part of the organized activities but always make certain everyone is aware of the options avaialable. Tip the bar staff gernerously - you will not regret it. The first few days we were there, very few small children present. Not that we are 'anti-kids' or anything, but for the last few days, there were so many small kids, at times the pool was almost unuseable. One last thing....their TV sucks big time.

I must admit I was wondering what a 3-4 star resort in Mexico would be like, and some of the previous reviews added to my concern. However we left thinking this place is the Mayan Rivera\u2019s best kept secret! If anyone has read my other reviews you will know we are pretty easy travelers to please, so the fact that there was not a Jacuzzi in our room did not bother us. The fact that there are only 2 a-la-cartes was OK too. In fact if the food is good and we don\u2019t have to cook it \u2013 great! We flew with Sunwing and I must say the experience with them was very good. I injured my leg badly a week before we left and up until the day before we departed was not sure I would be able to make the trip. We showed up at the airport at the start of the check in and they took one look at me hobbling with a cane and did all they could to make sure we got a seat that would make me as comfortable as possible. On the trip home I was moving much better but they still had a note to give me an aisle seat. Also on the way home someone from Sunwing had to make a difficult decision to not let a very inebriated couple on the plane. Not too good for that couple I am sure but the other passengers we spoke with were quite relieved to hear they were not flying with us. The beer sold on the bus ride from the airport to the resort was refreshing but at $4 a bottle a bit steep in price! The resort is small, in fact one of the smallest I have stayed at. This was good (remember the leg) since from our room it was a-2 minutes to the lobby and buffet and only about a minute to the beach. The previous complaints about the wine are valid. I have had communion wine that tastes better! But this is the Caribbean and there is always the rum punch! The Jacuzzi in the pool area is not heated \u2013 one of the staff told me it was because kids use that one and that there is a heated one for the adults in the gym area. But this is the Caribbean and there is always the ocean! And the beach . . . what a lovely beach! Lots of shade, lots of chairs, lots of sand and that marvelous blue-green Caribbean. The animation team were fun, they let you know about all the activities but there was no pressure to join if you did not want to. We really enjoyed the stretch class each morning on the beach but preferred it when they had it on a quieter corner of the beach area rather than \u201cfront and centre\u201d where everyone was watching the class and it was noisy. One of the leaders was a bit of a performer and I think we did the class on the front part of the beach because he likes to be on display. We went to one show that was funny, how do you do comedy that will work in such a multicultural audience? They managed to get it right! There were lots of staff in the eating areas, bars, front desk, and maintaining the grounds. Everything was very well taken care of, very tidy and evidence of lots of painting and improvements going on. The rooms were nice, clean and basic. We ended up with 2 double beds rather than a king one, but I wanted to avoid stairs and that was what was available on the main floor. After 32 years of marriage and with a very sore leg having a bed to myself was just OK with me. We found the beds firm, but like a firm mattress so slept very well. Food was really good, we missed our reservation at the bamboo a la carte which was disappointing, the Italian and Mexican one were good and we were really pleased with the buffet. Lots of variety, lots of fresh stuff. The drinks are NOT watered down like some other resorts and the lobby bar makes a great Latte. The only excursion we went on was to Coba since I could get taken around on a rickshaw type of thing (leg again . . .) and that was amazing. My husband climbed the pyramid, I just stood at the bottom and waved my cane at him. It was a great trip, we were very happy at the Azteca and visited the Maya which is a sister resort down the beach. It was really nice to and perhaps a bit \u201cyounger\u201d a crowd.

We went in to Playa for dinner one evening, in order to have one meal off the property. The desk staff recommended Casa del Aqua for a nice place for dinner. They said it is one of the nicer restaurants in town, with a well deserved reputation.After a fantastic meal, we had to agree. If you are looking for a reasonably priced resort, we highly recommend the Viva Azteca. We are already thinking about our return trip.

No trolley, no bus and no waiting for a shuttle. Point A to Point B in a 1 to 2 minute walk and you are there. Vacation must be effortless. Location: Resort is very well situated in the very secure and beautiful Playacar which is a 20 minute walk to Playa del Carmen or $5.00 U.S and 5 minutes away by taxi. The site is very well maintained and clean. The rooms are very clean, staff at all levels from the front desk to cleaning personnel are very polite and helpful. The beach is beautiful, and there are no shortage of beach chairs at this resort, unlike other resorts I have been to. The swimming pool area is clean but a little small. There is a lack of chairs here because the area is small. Food at buffet and snack bar by the pool is good, not excellent, just good. You have enough to choose from that you will not go hungry.

Tip: Reserve your a la carte restaurant immediately after you check-in I always say, you get what you pay for.

Over all it was a nice resort and good value for the money. We have never stayed at a 3 1/2 star resort and now can see exactly what the difference means. First the good: The resort was clean, our room was in the building right off the lobby bar. We had asked for a room on the top floor with a king size bed and a balcony that we would be able to sit out on. Room 3307 met all our requirements. The bed was very comfortable, and the pillows comfortable. We did not have a coffee maker but we did have a small bar frig, inside the desk/ dresser that was restocked daily with bottles of water, pepsi, 7-up, and soda water. There were double sinks, and a full tub and shower. Our balcony looked over the gardens and had 2 chairs and a small table. It got sun most of the day. The beach is everything you dream of, we had no trouble getting lounge chairs with a little shade. The entertainment staff were friendly but not pushy. At the front desk they have a selection of cell phone chargers so will charge your phone for you. There is now WiFi there and our room was close enough to the lobby to get a signal there. The Bad: The food left a little to be desired, there are 3 specialty restaurants but not one is a steak house, the food at the buffet was OK but due to the smaller population of the resort there were fewer choices than at other resorts we have been to. The omelete station at breakfast was nice but having the same thing daily gets boring after a while. They will also make eggs to order. We are not early risers and most mornings they had run out of bacon by the time we got there. The bacon is behind a counter and you have to ask for it. There is a nice selection of fruit, yougurt and pastries. But they really cater to the european guests. It is also a nice touch to be able to order a continental breakfast to be delivered to our room one morning and relax on our balcony over coffee. Now for the ugly! Our room had a connecting door but it might as well been made of tissue paper, the last week we were there the guests in that room were Italian and were very loud. We did ask them to be quieter but the did not seem to realise how loud they were. They would come to the room at midnight and have a loud discussion while one was in the shower and then were up and talking again by 7:30 in the morning. On our last night there the alarm clock in their room started buzzing at 11:55, waking us up. After about 10 minutes we called the front desk, they said they would send someone up. After 30 minutes my husband went to the desk and they called the room, and finally went up and turned it off after 45 minutes. The amenities are very basic, there is a dispenser on the wall in the bathroom that has shampoo and shower gel, there is no body lotion as we have gotten in other resorts. There is also no Kleenex in the rooms. The drawers in the desk/ dresser were fine but there are shelves and drawers in the closet that have a very musty smell.

The hotel is a fairly small facility which is a plus for some people. The grounds are about average for hotels in the area. The hotel staff is very nice, friendly, and accommodating. The only exception was some use of loud profanity (in both Spanish and English) by a couple members of the recreation staff. This hotel does not offer the level of service that other similarly priced hotels in the area provide. There are no waiters or waitresses to serve you at the tables in bar areas. If you are seated at a table, you must get up and go fetch your own drinks. The rooms are small and sparsely furnished. If you are OK with living out of your suitcase for a week, this should not be a problem. Lighting in the rooms, especially the bathrooms, is poor at best. After day three and two visits from the hotel engineering department, we gave up on use of the air conditioner. This was not a major issue, as the evenings were unusually cool and the room offered a patio door with a full screen. The food was good, but the hotel offers a very limited variety when compared to other hotels in the area. The Hotel seems to have a strange affinity for hot dogs. This selection could be found at every location, for every meal. The lunch served at the main (beach) bar was the same every day (Hot dogs, hamburgers, and pizza). Again, a little variety and maybe some Mexican favorites would have spiced up this rather bland selection. Guests do have the option to walk five minutes down the way to the Wyndham Maya to use the restaurants and facilities at that location. There is really not much difference between the two however. Use caution in the pool area. The pool is surrounded by a very beautiful stone tile that offers no traction to wet feet. I saw a number of people slip and spent very little time in this area. It really is a very dangerous situation. The pool is also fairly small for a hotel of this size. The apron area accommodates about 75 sun loungers. Again, not up to par with other properties in the area. The beach is absolutely beautiful and very wide. There are a number of planned beach activities daily (volleyball, soccer, darts, bocci, and a few others). If you are interested in snorkeling, this area does not provide access to this activity. You can however book a two hour boat trip from the Wyndham Maya to a local reef for $35 USD. The gym / spa area was probably the worst area of the hotel. The gym offers LifeTime brand fitness equipment which is good quality. The gym itself was dirty. It offered no means of wiping down the equipment befor or after use. The adjacent spa area was unkept. We arrived before our room was ready and were told we could change in the spa area. We found another location. Enough said. The hotel managemrnt would be well advised to put the gym attendant in charge of cleaning the area. Overall, if you get a fantastic deal at this location, go for it. If you are deciding between competitively priced packages, look elsewhere and avoid being disappointed. Other locations offering competitive packages were the Palladium, Barcelo, and Grand Sirenis a little further down the coast.

Totally avoid the people at the desks who are giving you a great deal on excursions. Sunwing rep stated these trips are at an excellent price and lots of times they are a no show, so if it sounds to good it probably is. The Azteca is good value for the money. Rooms are very clean, the staff wash every rooms floor, windows, mirrors every day. The grounds are constantly being cleaned. The floor is good for such a place however the a la carte restaurants (Italian, Mayan, Chinese) are all excellent and you get to experience different foods and have someone wait on you if your tired of the buffet. Staff tries very hard to make your stay as pleasant as possible, from engaging you in beach games to the nightly evening shows. The beer is cold, they will make you any drink they can, and they do it with a smile. If your young and want to stay up and party hardy, definately the Viva Mayan. If your more family or older and don't want as much action, then the Azteca. I would recommend the first level for rooms, they all have walk outs to the grounds. The pool bar is open until 6am (for food) and 2am for alchol so if you need to sleep, get a room overlooking the gardens/grounds. We were above the pool, only one night was rowdy, keeping the door closed and air conditioner on drowned out the noise (you need the air due to the humidity). I emailed that I would like a king bed, 2nd floor overlooking pool. Got a king bed, overlooking pool, 3rd floor. The place was packed, people from all over the world. If you wait to demand a king on day of arrival, guess what...it won't be available. They will do their best to please you. My only real complaint is that the bed was rock hard. I've heard this complaint about many of the hotels there. I took 2 aspirins a day for 3 days then I became use to the bed. I can't believe the negative comments, again you get what you pay for. If your paying for a budget holiday, why does it come as a surprise to one if you don't get the presidential suite?

When I requested a change, the man told me he could not do anything at the time but to come to the reception the following day. When I did, they advised no kings were avail but I would be able to get the room the following day. By day 2, when I went back, no rooms were again available... so I just gave up! :-( As for the food, we ate well, the A la carte restaurants were all very good. The main buffet also showed a good variety. Good but very simple.... If you go as a family and prefer staying by the pool, there is really a limited amount of chairs... We mainly always stayed by the beach and never had any problems finding a spot. The bars are all very well stocked... although no beach bar!! :-( Finally, the entertainment is so-so, and the shows are a little highscholish.... So we went to 1 1/2 and then gave up... On the last day, because the bus was not picking us up before 10h30pm, sunwing had advised we would be able to keep our rooms until 5h30 for an extra fee. This had to be arranged with the front desk. After many attempts, they never wanted to guarantee the availability. On the last morning, I was at the reception at 8h30am for them to tell us we had to check out by noon but that a hospitality suite would be available free of charge. I chose to use tis room at 5h30pm. When I showed up at the reception at 5h15, I was told no suite was available and to go take my shower in the gym..... Very Dissapointing!!!

Only the time on the monitors was changed. Finally by approx 10h50, a crew showed up and we left at 12h35.... 10 hours after our original departure time.....

We also had a coffee maker, which we didn't use because the pool bar was so close by and we were there every morning for capucinno. The maid kept the room very clean and restocked the fridge with soda and water every day. She also left towel art every day. The food at the Azteca was quite good with a great selection. You could always find something to eat and sometimes there were too many options for me. What to choose??? Desserts were yummy, especially the rice pudding. Someone on this forum made a comment about the bacon being rationed. If you asked the server for more, he would give you more. They had theme nights such as Mexican night, Japanese night, etc. My husband and I enjoyed an a la carte meal at the Mayan restaurant Xul-Ha. The starter, a lemony chicken soup, was wonderful and the appetizer and the grouper main course were delicious. A lunch buffet was served at the pool bar every day, but it was mostly hot dogs, fries, pizza etc. There was more variety at the main buffet El Nopal, well worth the walk. I must say, though, that my husband just loved the french fries. The animation staff were great and worked hard to get the guests to participate in pool aerobics, darts, ping pong tournaments, merengue lessons etc. If you like to walk, it is 20 mins. into Playa Del Carmen and less than 5 mins. to Plaza Playacar just down the street.

Flight and transportation with Sunwing were fine. Check-in was easy and quick. Arrived at noon and got our bracelets. Room was ready at 3:00 as expected. The resort is located on the south side of Playa Del Carmen in a gated community. There are many beautiful houses in the area and a small Mayan ruin. You pass all these as you walk into PDC. It is about a 20 minute walk, and you just follow the street the hotel is on. It takes you right to the Taxi centre on 10th Avenue and the start of the 5th Avenue shopping. We found the food at this resort to be average. I only have 5 star resorts to compare it to, but wasn't expecting better than we received. The only resort where they ration bacon at breakfast. You had to ask for it and only got 2-3 slices unless you pressed for more. We enjoyed the meal at Bamboo, The Mayan restaurant and the Italian were just OK. The Fun Team was great. They encouraged involvement to the activities and accepted \"no\" if you chose not to join in. They mingled with the guests during breakfast and lunch and were eager to learn about their customers and where they came from. The down side I saw was on our last day when the beach was closed. There was a large contingent of French Canadians that overtook the pool area. They were drinking heavily and forced the Fun Club to find another way to have their afternoon activities for the rest of the guests. The bartenders here are great. They will make anything you ask, and will even fill up the 52oz Big Bubba thermal mugs if you ask them. Take your own thermal mugs as the cups they use are small. Manuel was our favourite bartender. He made a point of telling other bartenders to use Tanguray instead of local Gin for my wife's drinks. They also make a great Spanish coffee in the main bar at night. We never made it to any of the shows, but heard them all from our room. If you don't like loud music and noise, avoid Building C as it is the closest to the Theatre and the after hours DJ music. There is only one pool and it was quite small. Get down early to reserve a lounger. The beach had no shortage of loungers. The wave's were excellent and made for a great time trying to ride them. Make sure you get a boogey board from the Fun Club staff. The beach was closed on our last day. There is an effort underway to repair all the damage done by recent hurricanes. We could see them moving towards our resort and they did get there on the last day. Basically, they bring sand over on a ship from Cozumel, and spray it with water onto the beach. Using this sand, they raised the height of the beach and extended it out further. See the photos I have included. All in all, we didn't have a bad time here, but we would pay the extra to go elsewhere.

The room, was very clean and was a basic room that served its purpose, small fridge with water/soda, we received our towels animals each day which was an added treat. The resort had one pool and hot tub that weren't heated, but we were there for the beach anyways. The water color was fantastic and beach was great, despite the sandbags. We had read on TA about the sandbags, and knew they were there, but to see them in person, they really are an eyesore. We found spot where we could angle our chair and look off to the right of the resort where there were none. The sandbags really ruin the beauty of the beaches, hopefully the beach restoration will remove them. We always found available chairs at the beach. All the a la carte restaurants: chinese, mexican and italian were great in both food and service. The buffet restaurant left something to be desired, there was a lot of choices but nothing that appealed to us. We are not picky eaters, we just felt the meal choices more focused on european then traditional mexican or american fare. Lunch we stuck to the pool bar which had fast-food type choices, burgers, pizza, nachos etc. At both the pool bar and the courtyard bar the bartenders were great and made some great drinks. There was no beach bar, and the pool bar was a decent walk from the beach, there was no beach service, which the resort should strongly consider adding--even if its just a beer/wine soda station on the beach. The courtyard in the middle of the resort was something we had never seen in 5 or 6 visits to Mexico, it was a nice central meeting spot, where the buffet restaurant and courtyard bar flowed out into on large courtyard area, centered by a water fountain. They had signature drinks each night, margaritas one night, champagne with fruit puree another.. a nice added treat. Every night the courtyard was filled with guests. The activities staff came around every morning to say hello to everyone and would ask you to get involved but did not force you to do anything. We thought it was great that they made a point to engage the guests, one even joined us for lunch and another night we chatted at the courtyard bar.

This year we decided on the Viva Wyndham Azteca. I would say the only criticisms that i would have about the vacation was the travel time from the airport to the resort was not as we were told. We were told that it was a 20 minute ride to the resort which in fact was 1 1/2 hours. We had to stop at 3 other resorts before we reached ours, not to mention that we were delayed leaving the airport by 1/2 hour. The rooms were musty and the bathrooms had some mold on the ceilings. This was not a big concern as we knew that we would spend the majority of our time outside the room. The last crisiticism was about the garbage we found in the water. It was on the second day we thought we would enjoy another day in the waves of the ocean. When i got in i found a piece of plastic floating in the water which i picked up and tossed in the garbage container on the beach. It was not until i got in again that i noticed that there was plastic wrappers from various items floating in the water, too many to collect. This was not a happy day but also something that i really could not hold the resort accountable for as we were not sure where it was coming from. The very next day there were no signs of the garbage anywhere to be seen. Overall i found that this resort was a nice place to visit. The beach itself was cleaned regularly, the staff were very professional, polite, and always full of energy. I found the food to be very good. I am a pescatarian, but my partner is not. We found that the selection was very good. The various theme nights allowed for variety in your food selection. Our favorite restaurant was the Mexican restaurant, the food was amazing. The Bamboo restaurant and Italian restaurant were average. The bar itself was something we had never experienced before. They had every selection of alcohol you could imagine and it was all included in the all inclusive. I would recommend this resort to anyone that recognizes the important things about going to a resort and can overlook the minor faults. We had an amazing time with amazing weather. I can't compliment the staff enough. They were fantastic. One last point. If you are asked to visit the VIP Service desk for your free gift, don't go. It is a sales gimmick.

No, it's not a top of the line resort but you're also not paying top of the line prices. For the amount you're paying, you're getting a very good deal. What I liked 1. The price. 2. The staff. Helpful & friendly. 3. My room. Nothing fancy but plenty of space. Some people have complained about the beds which surprised me. I'm usually pretty finicky about beds and have difficulty sleeping in uncomfortable beds, but had no problem here. Slept great. There was an alarm clock and the TV remote worked. The TV seemed to work fine, too, but I only turned it on to catch the weather report. And the cleaning staff did an excellent job. I agree with other posters - the towel art was great - a dinosaur, turkey, elephant. They were cute. One thing to keep in mind. They don't provide conditioner so bring some with you. 4. The food. I only went to the buffet and liked the food. I miss having hot chocolate, mango yogurt, and chilaquiles for breakfast. Yes, it did get a bit boring by the end of the week, but the food was tasty and it beat the heck out of having to cook it myself. Also, the bar by the pool serves lattes & cappucino. So I'd get up in the morning, have a coffee, enjoy the very early morning views, and then go for a walk along the beach with only a few people about. I feel more relaxed just remembering this. I had read recommendations to bring your own mug because the resorts serve drinks in small plastic cups. But you don't have to bring a mug here as they use decent sized cups. 5. The beach. Very pretty, nice place to walk. Had a lovely time here. Some of the loungers are shaded by palm trees and palapas which is very nice as the sun is intense. But there's plenty of loungers in the sun, and you can move the loungers, if you want to be in the sun. I had no idea that the beach is so clean because they actually have staff dig a hole and bury the seaweed every morning. And they rake the sand by the loungers every morning. What I didn't like. 1. The LOUD music from the activities by the pool. For several hours during the middle of the day, it was incredibly loud. I can hear loud music at home. I travel thousands of miles so I can hear the ocean. So I would go over to the beach by the RIU next door. I could hear the music even in parts of the RIU beach, it was that loud. BTW, RIU also has a nice beach but all of the loungers are out in the sun, not much in the shade except during the late afternoon. 2. Check in. The woman at the check in counter was the only employee here who just wasn't helpful. She gave me no information about the resort. Her directions on how to get to my room were only to tell me to go straight and then turn left. So I was wandering around the resort trying to find my room. On the plus side, I asked one of the activity staff for directions. Instead of just giving me directions, he picked up and carried my bag, took me to my room, and even showed me how to adjust the air conditioning. 3. Internet. No wireless and only 3 computers that guests can pay to use. Three computers aren't enough for all the guests and usually at least one of them wasn't working. Sometimes two of them weren't working. 4. The whirlpool wasn't heated. 5. I'm a Wyndham by request member but received no benefits. No welcome drink or snack, no free internet use. But seriously, except for the loud music, the negatives were relatively minor and certainly didn't prevent me from having a great time. What I don't know about the resort. Didn't go to the tennis court, restaurants or evening shows so can't comment on them. Didn't have little kids with me so can't comment on the kids' club. So if you really want something fancy, pay a lot more money and go to a fancy resort.

The beach was okay, did have some erosion but they did keep it clean. As for our flights DO NOT USE SUNWING VACATIONS OR AIRLINES EVER. We were delayed 13 hours in vancouver because they did'nt have a spare tire and they tried to keep us in the hotel all night. They knew at 5pm that it was going to be delayed and it took until midnight for them to put us in a hotel and only after many people complained and rushed the desk and demanded to have a supervisor come and explane the delay. And then they never let our hotels know the plane was delayed so the hotels considered us \"no shows\" and we were given shittier rooms than we would have been assigned. Also our flight left on the 19th and we didn't get there till the 20th and we were forced to check out on the 26th and our flight did not leave until 5am (630 with the airline delay) so we had to be out of our room 13 hours before we even left for the airport, we were denied late check out because they were at max occupancy. So our 7 night vacation was actually 6 nights only and they were not accomodating at the hotel at all. So for reference in the future CHECK FLIGHT TIMES SO YOU DO NOT GET SCREWED LIKE WE DID!!! The city was cool, 5th avenue was typical tourist stuff, we went to a restaurant called El Alux it was a great meal, expensive but nice... underground in a cave with lounge/bar and an amazing sight to see. Taxi get better deals with peso's they do 10-1 when the exchange is 12-13 to 1. The tours were a rip off forsure... they wanted 95 dollars each to go to the tulum ruins and we paid a taxi 800 peso's and he drove us there, back, to some private beautiful cenotes (freshwater pools) for snorkling, gave us a tour play by play of the land, waited while we toured the ruins, took us out for the best lunch for taco's at a mexican restaurant over 6 hours.. Way better than any tour i have ever been on. And if you go on the ferry to cozumel, sit at the back, not the front so you don't get sick. And scooters are cheaper on the other side! I will never go back there in the forseeable future, And my view of wyndham hotels/ resorts is now tainted.

The Azteca is a nice little resort with a low quality rooms, a great beach, and so - so food. I am surprised that they are reviewed as hight as they are!!!! High points: 1) Great Beach - A lot of beautiful white sand. You can walk without sandals and not have to walk on coral. 2) Great Staff - Always smiling. 3) Room cleaning was great 4) Great site for singles, or families with teenagers. Low Points: 1) The room was very basic - I had to ask for an alarm clock, the TV remote was broken (the hotel did replace quickly), TV reception quality was very low. There was water damage on the bathroom door. There was also a loud noise from the A/C system from the neighboring hotel. The telephone was not free for local calls. I had to \"open\" the line and leave $20 at the front desk. I was told that I could not use a calling card at the hotel. The hotel had a hard time validating charges to my room phone when I checked out - They ended up not charging me anything (because of their problems). 2) The food was ok but not great. They really are very heavy on the SALT. Don't bother with the 3 restaurants as the buffet has better quality food, and a lot more selection. 3) Don't use the hotel's automatic bank machine. They charge a very bad exchange rate. So bad that I would say it is a scam! They charged me a 14.5 pesos per USD. The actual rate should have been much closer to 12.5. This worked out to a 20% charge! I alway expect to take a hit, just not this big! 4) We asked for change (we did not ask for a money exchange) at the front desk, and I was surprised that they were not able to help. 5) We had a continental breakfast served to our room one morning. This was not worth it at all. It was a joke and we had to eat the breakfast buffet right after. This did not cost us anything, but It was a disappointment. 6) The kids services were almost not existent. The kids club was a joke. 7) This is not in regards to the hotel...but we encountered a lot of dishonest hustlers. Watch your money! Watch the exchange! One old couple, told us to pay everything in Pesos, and get the money exchanged before going to Mexico.....great advise.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort - Worth the Visit\u201d", "Author": "EdmontonBlair", "ReviewID": "UR51896112", "Content": "This was mine and my girlfriend\u2019s 5th trip to an all-inclusive tropical resort in the past three years, so we have lots to compare to. Our travelling style is to relax and mostly enjoy the beach, and this resort was perfect for just that! In previous trips we have stayed at larger, more complex 5 star resorts so staying at the slightly smaller 4 star Azteca with its intimate and cozy atmosphere was a nice change and this resort offered everything we have come to expect with its larger counterparts. Service: From the time we arrived to the day we left, all of the staff was extremely friendly and courteous. Check-in was fast, and the staff at the front desk was always helpful with any questions we had. In the restaurants and at the bars, the staff was very friendly and attentive. Language was never a barrier as all of the staff spoke English well, and tips were not expected. With this resort being slightly smaller the staff tended to remember you and what your drink preferences are. Overall, service was excellent. Food: Buffet was average and the selection was somewhat limited but we always left satisfying our appetite. The restaurant staff was always attentive and willing to serve. The 24 hour snack bar was always filled with salads, fries, pasta, and pizza and was above average compared to other resort\u2019s snack bars. We went to 2 of the 3 al la carte restaurants and we have nothing but good things to say about these. We were also allowed to eat at the sister resort down the beach but never felt the need. Rooms/Cleanliness: Our room was cleaned daily, and we never had issues with the resort\u2019s or our room\u2019s cleanliness. Overall, the entire resort was spotless from the lobby to the public bathrooms to the beach/pool. Pool/Beach: With us spending most of the time on the beach, we were extremely satisfied with this resort. The beach was huge, there were lots of loungers available, and it never felt crowded. The beach was close (but not too close) to the resort so getting drinks or food were only about a one minute walk away. We took many walks up and down the beach that connected to the other resorts, and we can honestly say the Azteca has one of the nicest, biggest, and cleanest beaches we saw. Another nice thing we noticed about this beach -- no peddlers selling stuff. We spent very little time at the pool but it was never crowded and there was always room available at anytime of the day. The pool did have music playing throughout the day as most resorts do. Location: The Azteca was located in a private \"hotel/condo\" district with restricted entrance ensuring a private and safe location. There was a small shopping center located in the area, consisting mostly of souvenir shops and also a Starbucks. The resort was roughly about a 5 minute drive to Playa Del Carmen. Entertainment: Throughout the day, the entertainment team provided plenty of activities. The entertainment staff always asked if we were interested in activities, but were never pushy about it. The team was overall young and was always friendly and entertaining. This same team doubled as the night entertainment, and although the shows were amateur at best the crew did an amazing job considering the amount of time they put in working during the day. The night show was a good way to spend an hour being entertained, but do not expect Broadway entertainment as some other guests tended to expect. Overall, this resort met or exceeded all expectations and was perfect for a quiet getaway. If you are travelling to the Mayan and looking for a great value I would not hesitate to stay here.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chelsea, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNot luxurious but clean and convenient\u201d", "Author": "chelsea_vette", "ReviewID": "UR51684521", "Content": "The Wyndham Azteca is what I would call a basic all inclusive resort that is conveniently located and is good value for the price. My wife and I have stayed at the RIU resorts in Playacar in the past. This was our first visit to the Azteca. The good: Location is excellent, only a 15 minute walk into town. Resort is very clean and the staff are excellent. The beach is great with lots of shady areas available. The not so good: The food was pretty good, but selection is quite limited compared to the RIU resorts. The decor is basic and a little dated but okay.... Summary: Considering the price we paid for one week was about 60% of what we would have paid at the RIU Yucatan, we were quite satisfied. If you are looking for a real fancy upscale place, then this isn't for you, but if you want a basic clean all inclusive with friendly staff at a very reasonable price, then I recommend the Azteca.

We paid $48 a day combined for the two of us through Bookit.com Check In: Upon arrival they needed your passport, immigration card, and a credit card to place a hold on. The welcome \"cocktail\" was a mango juice with no alcohol. There was a bellman who took our bags to our room and gave us a quick tour along the way. You must wear a wristband for the duration of your stay which then must be turned in upon checkout. The room: I can best describe this hotel room as similar to that at a Super8. The room had two full beds, a mini fridge with a can of pepsi, club soda, 7up, and 2 bottles of water. The bathroom had a separate area for the toilet and tub. Shower gel and shampoo are in a wall pump dispenser and were basic in quality. A cheap bar of soap was provided for the sink. Tube style TV with a handful of English channels. Small patio balcony 2'x7'. Bed average in comfort. Room was clean overall. No carpet except for a small rug between the beds. Food: The buffet bordered on horrible. One morning I could not take it anymore and went into town to get McDonalds. It was the oddest combination of foods I have ever seen. None of it even truly Mexican. The restaurants, which you need to make reservations for were WONDERFUL. Best part of staying at this hotel. Drinks were fine at the bars..Dos XX beer is served. Call liquors are available and were provided free of charge upon request. The 24 hour snack bar was fruit, condiments, pizza, and french fries. That's it. Entertainment: The entertainment staff here was rather annoying..they go around all day trying to get you to play games and lame activities. They were nice overall but you can tell they are wannabe womanizers. Giving most of their attention to younger females. We did not go to any of their shows or their \"disco.\" The sister resort Viva Maya, which you have access to was way more chill on the activities. Beach/Pool: Did not spend much time at the pool..the whirlpool is not heated. Pool was warmer than it. Beach was topless..some people were, others not. Lots of Europeans in speedos and skimpy swimwear. Overall this resort had close to 90% European guests. Beach was pretty, lounge chairs were hard plastic with a mesh covering. Some chairs were fine, some were painful to lay on. We did not do any water sports or activities. I'd recommend a cab ride to 5th ave...it's 50 pesos..(less than $5USD) has tons of shops and restaurants. It was a nice escape from the resort. Within walking distance from the resort, there was a small row of shops and a Starbucks. Best part of this hotel is the value. Worst is the rooms and buffet food.

However, it is the little things that the hotel just does not do right that make our stay more of an average experience rather than a fantastic one. With all of the competition in the area, I feel no compelling reason to return to this resort rather than try something new. The Good: Rooms: The rooms are very spacious, well appointed, and comfortable. Nice amenities in the bathroom and the fridge. Many rooms have a view even if they are not directly on the oceanfront. Cleanliness: The room cleaning service and general cleanliness of the resort is fantastic. Beach: Beach is large and well maintained. Plenty of loungers on the beach and easy access to boogie boards and other items. There are hippos to prevent erosion but they make swimming easier. Breakfast: The buffet at the El Nepal buffet is really good. Great coffee, eggs to order, fresh cheeses and juices. Breakfast opens early and keeps going til 11 AM to accommodate you if you want to sleep in, or get an early start climbing pyramids. The Average: Buffet Dinner: There are limited spots at the ala carte restaurants and the Mayan restaurant is closed. The only options aside from the buffet are an italian and an asian themed restaurant. The buffet rotates themes each night but 80% of the items are the same. My favorite at the buffet was the homemade pasta on international night and the bbq fish on bbq night. A la Carte Dinner: Book early as they only allow 8 persons per seating. Bamboo is good, but really avoid the sushi as they cannot make sushi rice well. The soups and tempura were good. At the italian restaurant the salad was very well done, but the pasta course was with dried pasta (strange since they made fresh pasta for the buffet one night...) The main course I had was overcooked as well. Bars: Generally no lines at either bar, however the bar is far from the beach and there is no beach service. Decent selection of drinks and varying bartender friendliness. I didnt appreciate some of the staff that did not acknowledge a tip with a thank you etc. Location: The hotel is in playacar and is about a 20 minute walk from playa (tourist area). It is about a 5 minute walk to the playacar little mini mall. It is pretty much in the middle of hotel row. Guest Services Staff: Generally helpful when they are around,but limited hours. The front desk staff have limited tools to help you after 8 PM. One staff member pointed out a great snorkel desitntino for us, but the directions to get there were incomplete. At one point we were standing on a semi deserted highway bus stop where the directions left off... The Bad: Check In: The lady at check in was borderline rude. There was little information given about the resort, and the directions to our room were \"walk that way...then go right\" (No mention that our room was on the third floor and way down the walkway.) Tennis Court: The court itself was nice with an artificial surface and located on top of a building (which is a nice use of space) however, the net is torn and there was a dirty condom on the court. This is the example of a little thing that would take all of 10 minutes and 50 dollars to fix that would improve the overall experience. Nightly Shows: Be seriously drunk if you go...as they are really bad. I highly recommend going to the Maya property down the way as their staff is much better. The shows were poorly performed lip sync and dancing monstrosities. It would have been far better to have something lower scale and audience interactive. Entertainment Staff: Generally unfriendly...during our stay they instituted a policy of the entertainment staff eating dinner with guests. The staff member approached us and said \"Can I have dinner with you? We HAVE to eat dinner with guest now so hope its ok\" At dinner he was obviously not interested in conversation and couldn't wait to leave. Main Buffet Cook: The man who was the cook for the main course of the themed buffets was very impolite unless you were an attractive italian woman. My partner asked for a second course of pasta and was told he was \"wasting food\" when he asked for the fresh clams. This is an all inclusive...not a weight watchers camp. Internet: There was only one computer working, and you have to go to the store to buy an internet access card, then go to the internet room. There is no wireless access. Just go into town to use the net if you need to. Recommendation: This is an ok place to go, but the lack of attentiveness of the staff (even when tipped) makes this not a place I would go to. We spent a good deal of time at the Maya where the staff are far more helpful and the atmosphere is more lively. However, the cleanliness and room conditions at the Maya are a little lacking.

We felt it was a good value for the money. The staff were friendly and would greet us no matter what they were doing. The service at the buffet was hit or miss\u2014sometimes we had servers taking away our plates and offering us drinks, sometimes they were nowhere to be found (like if we needed an extra napkin). We left a couple of dollars each time we ate and even when we went to the bar\u2014I\u2019m sure it\u2019s appreciated but not required. We didn\u2019t get any better service because we left tips. Rooms: Average but very clean. The first room we had was a smoking room, so as soon as I walked in and smelled it, I called the front desk and they moved us to another room without a fuss. The new room had the same great pool view as the first room. We were in room 1106, which was close to the pool, pool bar & food area, and the beach. I was pleased with how quickly they moved us. The other room was not ready yet, but they had people in there cleaning it as quickly as they could. The air conditioning was great\u2014always kept the room cool. Dining: The buffet food and pool bar food were average, but we really enjoyed the Italian restaurant, which we ate at twice since it was the only restaurant we could get reservations for. One complaint is that the Japanese restaurant was closed during the 5 days we were there. We were told by staff it was because it was low season\u2014not sure about that? The Mexican restaurant was closed one night and when we asked why we were told that it was a regular day for it to be closed. I\u2019m not sure why they would close it, because it really limits what is available. When I peaked at the reservation list at the Italian restaurant, there were only 4-5 parties for each time slot, meaning there are a lot of people trying to get few available spots in a short time frame (6-9 p.m.?). One of the main reasons we booked this hotel was because it had three specialty restaurants and we wanted to try new food. We were going to book the same resort we had stayed at in the Spring, since the two are comparable in size, but we wanted to try new restaurants at this resort. Reservations can only be made one day in advance, so you have to visit the reservation desk (in the lobby) each day\u2014what a hassle! When we made the reservation, my husband was told to wear long pants (which we knew), but when we went to the restaurant there were men with shorts and sandals, so I don\u2019t think they are strict about it. Guests at this hotel can also use the facilities and restaurants at the other Wyndham resort, Viva Wyndham Maya, at no additional cost. This was a nice feature we didn\u2019t use, since our stay was so short but would have liked to. The guests at the Maya cannot use the Azteca facilities or restaurants though. We walked along the beach to see the Maya (it's probably 3-4 hotels down the way) and it seemed to be just as nice. I liked the beach area of the Azteca better. Beach & Pool: We felt the beach area was very nice, compared to some nearby hotels, which we realized after walking up the beach for some distance. There was a fairly large beach area (for the size of the resort and number of people) and plenty of chairs and shade. We didn\u2019t have to get up too early to save our chairs, which was a nice change from other resorts we\u2019ve stayed at. There were some large sand bags in the beach front of this hotel, but they weren\u2019t too bad and didn\u2019t really get in the way\u2026I thought they would be bad after reading some reviews, but we didn\u2019t mind them. The pool was small, but nice. The hot tub never really seemed to be hot, but the bubbles felt nice. Services: We used the travel agency in the hotel lobby to book an excursion to Tulum. The service was good and the prices were the same we would have paid if we booked at the online \"discounted\" rates. They had a lot of options \u2013 excursions for all interests and tastes. We booked the Tulum Express half-day tour because we wanted to get back in time to enjoy the beach. The shuttle picked us up at 8 a.m. and we were back at the resort by 1:30 p.m. We borrowed boogie boards each day, sometimes we were told we could check them out all day, sometimes for 30 minutes, sometimes for an hour. There were catamarans, wind surf, snorkeling equipment, kayaks, etc., but we didn\u2019t use any of these things. They always seemed to be available though. We received a notice and call from the VIP Services person, asking us to stop by her office for a free welcome gift. We didn\u2019t go in until the second day of our stay, but it would have been helpful to stop in the first day because the hostess gave us a quick overview of the hotel and how things work. Since we had explored the first day, we pretty much knew where things were and how they worked. The main reason for the VIP visit is to tell guests about the Wyndham\u2019s Vacation Club and get them to an informational meeting. We were told it is not a timeshare, but we weren\u2019t interested and passed up the offer. We still received a small welcome gift (we chose a clay plaque with a Mayan image on it). If we would have signed up for the meeting, we could have received a $50 gift store or spa credit or excursion credit (I think this is what she said). She said members of the vacation club would get special rates and special services during their stays. It wasn\u2019t high-pressure like some agencies and we didn\u2019t go away with a bad feeling about it. Since it is quite a walk from the beach to the pool bar, I would suggest an insulated mug for drinks so you don\u2019t have to go back and forth so much. We even saw some people with large thermoses that the bartenders were filling with drinks. We were disappointed when we checked out that the staff person was not very friendly\u2014there was no \u201cthank you for staying with us\u201d or \u201cwe hope to see you again.\u201d Too bad because that\u2019s the last impression we have of them.

They were going to have us sign papers to notify next of kin in case of an emergency but they had someone elses name on them. When we brought it to the clerks attention she told us it was no problem as all the rooms were the same and she just scribbled out their name and inserted ours.

The rooms are basic but kept spotlessly clean. I never saw any bugs during our entire stay. The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

We ate at the Mayan a al carte restaurant and the Italian specialty also we went to the Viva Maya to the Mexican restaurants. We found the Mexican at the Mya hotel to be the best.. All the bars served brand name liquor in their cocktails and could make anything you wanted. The location of this hotel is handy to walk into town in about 15 minutes.

The pool was spotless, the entertainment staff were as good as we have known, nice & friendly, if you go hungry here you really are a picky eater, my only advice is put a t-shirt on at lunchtime and walk up to the buffet, the poolside snack bar is limited, but after all the clue is in the name (snack) the rooms are kept spotless, there`s cable tv so you can keep up with things. A tip to British people, and others where applicable, if you like a pint of bitter as opposed to the lite gassy lagers, ask the barmen for \"amber\", its s slightly darker beer with 90% less gas. We weren`t too struck on the specialty restaurants, but the Italian was the better for us two. Tips: 1. take a mask & snorkel 2. loads of mozzy rep, after all the entire area was jungle 30ish years ago. 3. take an insulated drinking mug Outside: Take a walk into town, its a 20 minute walk, or a 50 peso taxi ride, there`s loads of places to shop, eat & drink or just watch the world go by, the ferry to Cozumel leaves from here, its 140 pesos eachway and is well worth the day, we asked the owner of Mr. Chilli`s in the town, for a decent beach to spend the afternoon , he sent us to Playa Azul a 90 peso taxi ride from the ferry terminal, lovely little public beach with free sunbeds. We ate the ribs at Carlos & Charlies, also the food further along 5th Avenue @ Karen`s was good. We hired a car from an agent right across the road from the Azteca, i paid $45US for the day and went up to Cancun, i have been before but my partner hadn`t, fuel for the day was 100 pesos, ticket`s for Wet`n`Wild are $49US for the day, includes all food & drink (including alcohol). We booked the all day trip to Tulum & Coba @ the second agent on street when you get to town, he was charging $70US pp, but i got it for $55US , don`t know if it was a particularly great deal but it was value, Tulum was very very hot so take a cloth to wipe yourself down with, also take mozzy rep as it is in the middle of a swamp!! You can no longer climb the pyramids @ Coba, they closed em the day before we went, i have been to Chichen Itza on a previous trip and it is expansive and the best Mayan site, but it is a long day there & back its also very busy, and you cannot climb the pyramid there either. We are not one`s to go back to places as i`m a believer that its a big ol`world so see as much of it as you can, but i will seriously consider this for a return visit, everything was just right, the weather, the hotel, the beach and the people. drop me a line if you want any more info, i will answer where i can. If you have never been to Mexico and can`t decide between Playa del Carmen area or Cancun, believe me Playa del Carmen is 110% better, Cancun is like Vegas, massive mega-sized hotels, P-D-C is more \"mexican\" martin & sharon chesterfield, derbyshire", "Date": "October 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cWould definitely go back!\u201d", "Author": "jg1407", "ReviewID": "UR46566135", "Content": "We just got back from a one week stay at Mexico.

The friendliness of the staff is spot on.

If you want nightlife and a huge array of shops, head right towards 5th avenue, this is a 20 minute walk, or $5 taxi ride, and you have all the shops you could wish for! In the hotel itself there is an onsite gym, table tennis, tennis, massage excersise classes, free non powered water sports. However, if your like me, and just want to relax, you can sunbath all day and swim in the clear crystal water on the beach area right next to the pool.......to be honest....the furthest you would ever have to walk from your room to the beach is 100 yards!

We noticed that the restaurants had upwards of at least 10 tables empty during those times. I understand it was low season and they didn't necessarily have the staff for a full restaurant, but it seemed harder than it should have been.

The home made gelato ice cream is to die for and it was much talked about with my family. We stopped there first to see what the two available flavors were at lunch and dinner. Don't forget the chocolate sprinkles, they were the best too, no joke. The Italian restaurant was really nice looking inside and cool too, as it is hot as hell in Playa right now. The Japanese restaurant was great too, with our large party of 7 peeps, we got to our meal cooked for us right at the table with super sized portions of steak, chicken and my fave, shrimp. Vendors were around the main square at night, but they were kinda pricey. Believe it or not, the prices on jewelry in the hotel shop were not that bad. Don't be afraid to try out the Mexican dishes at the buffet as they are great too. The melted crumbled white cheese on the nacho chips with the some guacamole and pico de gallo and hot sauce and beans, yummy yummy for sure. The grounds were is super shape, very beautiful, lots of photo ops. Also, the beach is extra wide and roomy with plenty-o-beach chairs too. The staff was super nice, not one bad comment about them.

The international crowd made this a great learning experience for our teenagers and they inadvertantly got schooled about their world and its inhabitants!

As far as the hotel and grounds are concerned, this resort is outstanding, the workers are always cleaning and sweeping...the only advice I would give is to be very careful about the tiles near the pool area and bar area, as we witnessed several people falling on the wet tile, it is extremely slippery when wet, so don't walk too fast on it! Weather is also very humid, but the air conditioners work very well in the rooms--I was freezing and had to turn it down more than once!

Be careful of the guys on the beach trying to sell you a snorkel trip--one of them tried to get my sister-in-law to pre-pay in cash and when she told him that she would pay when she was on the boat, he disappeared! So, dont give any cash to anyone until you have completed your trip! But that is true in any country...don't ever give cash to a stranger, no matter where you are! The town of Playa del Carmen is a short bike ride away and the hotel has free bikes, a fun way to spend time out of the sun...but go in the morning because the shops are less crowded and the people are more willing to bargain during the day. Food was good, but the beef had a strange taste (my opinion only), some really liked it, but I did not...Bamboo (Oriental) restaurant was my son's favorite meal --themed like a Japanese Steakhouse, where they cook the food at your table, it was good and it was not hard to get a reservation. All in all, this trip was great for the money and we would go back for sure!!!", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cVIVA MEXICO\u201d", "Author": "phicolas", "ReviewID": "UR34266582", "Content": "Great vacations!!!

This was a last minute 4 day vacation for hubby and me. This is a great location, beautiful beach, extremely clean resort. This resort is definitely for families with children. We usually do select \"adults only\", but we could not pass up this great value for a short 3 nights. This is an older facility when the swimming pools were constructed on the smaller size. This pool was very, very busy each day with children who had a wonderful time. It is NOT for adults who want to enjoy a pool area unless you wanted to use the pool very early in the morning. The beach was lovely and we were there every day from 9AM until 6PM. Could not have asked for better!. Now, for what I will share as input and not negativity. This resort should focus on \"families\" only. If you are looking for a quiet romantic getaway, this is not the place (this time of year at least). The food was just \"ok\". I will admit that we were very disappointed when we arrived, when we were told that, because we were only staying 3 nights, we were not able to reserve dinner for those three nights on our day of arrival. Instead, we had to get to the desk between 8AM and 1PM each day to reserve. There are 3 Specialty Restaurants at this resort. BUT....only 2 are open each night. We did eat in the Italian our first night and the Mayan our second. We were not able to secure reservations on our third night. It was disappointing but certainly did not ruin our vacation. If I were to suggest to the management of this resort how to improve, I would suggest that they allow folks when they check in the opportunity to reserve dinner all at once and not have to keep running back to the desk each morning to reserve for that evening. The food at the Italian and Mayan restaurants were okay (Buffet Restaurant was actually better quality). When we stay at 3 or 4 Star \"all inclusives\" we do not expect 5 star food, so we were okay with this. This is a lovely resort with great beaches and location. I would recommend to friends who were looking for a bargain where they can enjoy a very clean facility, great staff, beautiful beach. We also were surprised to see that folks never left a few dollars for the staff after meals. I know it states \"all inclusive\", but we always appreciate how hard these people work and always leave money in our room for housekeeping every day, as well as at the pool, restaurants and for the bellmen. This is our fifth vacation in Cancun and we will be back for sure!", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat value option with plenty to do\u201d", "Author": "Wanderlust216", "ReviewID": "UR34140956", "Content": "Just returned from a great trip to Viva Azteca. The staff were all helpful and friendly. Our room had a partial ocean view which was great. Due to their affiliation with Viva Maya, there were endless things to do: trapeze, windsurfing, beach volleyball, tennis, and numerous other events and activities. While we were there (July 1-5), the premier beach lounge spots (up front) were taken early but there were still ample lounges for anyone. The temperature got very humid as soon as you stepped away from the ocean breeze. The only real drawbacks were the slippery-when-wet nature of the pool and snack bar deck (I saw more than a couple people fall down), the Mayan restaurant was not open while we were there, and there was inconsistent and mostly cool water in the room showers. An air-conditioned gym would be nice as well. The food ran the gamut from great to somewhat dissappointing but there are plenty of options so you will assuredly find something you like. We took one trip via colectivo from PDC to the tulum ruins, definitely worth the visit!

Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat place and great destination.\u201d", "Author": "Epaddler", "ReviewID": "UR33733803", "Content": "We had a great time at the Azteca and would like to return with family members and friends. Our first choice was actually the Wyndham Maya, this resort's sister hotel, but it was closed when we were making reservations because of the earlier swine flu scare. However, after hanging out at both places, we preferred the Azteca because it was smaller and we felt as if we had much better personal care. The Azteca also had one of the best beaches in the area and they have kayaks and Hobie sailboats you can use. As a guest of the Azteca you can use all the amenities at the Maya, so you don't lose out either way. Notes on airport arrival: We used USA transfers for our shuttle and were happy with the service. We booked roundtrip and it cost $15 a person each way. This was a private shuttle. They also had shared shuttles, which would save you a little, but we had four people, so the cost was the same. The airport was not quite as crazy as I expected, but if you have another ride lined up, avoid the guys wearing blue that try to intercept you and shift you to another mode of transportation. We used the money exchange in the airport and found that it was a better rate than we found later in Playa. The Azteca: We were very happy with the staff and service. The people were friendly and professional, the room was clean and the food and drinks were good and plentiful. We had one problem with a water leak in our room and they had someone fix it within about 20 minutes. As to the earlier reviews about the buffet quality, we found the food to be very good for a buffet, and like others, we got a little tired of the choices. They had different theme nights and we thought the best was Italian. Our only disappointment was with the reservation system used at the a-la-carte restaurants. It was very difficult to get reservation times, but when we arrived found that the restaurant would only have two or three tables in use. I\u2019m not sure if they were trying to reduce use of the restaurants to save money on staff, but it was a bit weird. Anyway, do take advantage of the reservations when you can get them. We had great food at the Italian restaurant at Azteca, and had another good meal at the Mexican restaurant at the Maya. The \u201canimation\u201d recreation staff was great, helpful, and interactive. Daily activities included dance lessons, Spanish lessons, windsurfing lessons, tequila volleyball and jenga, beach bocce, volleyball, and soccer tournaments, ping pong, etc. Even if you choose not to participate, it was fun. The entertainment shows didn\u2019t start until 9:30 pm and we had a difficult time staying up after our daily play time, but it was worth it. Even though the shows were performed by the same recreation staff, they were great. All staff at the resort seemed to be very hard working and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Playa: Do sign out the bikes to ride down to 5th Avenue. It is a quick and fun ride and you can leave them at the bike racks near the entrance to the tourist district at 5th. I had read many different opinions about the merchants on 5th. I think most were accurate. Some were a little annoying, but you just have to have a good sense of humor. When they would say something ridiculous like \u201c100% off\u201d or \u201cAlmost Free,\u201d we would usually respond back with a joke of our own and they typically very friendly. Tulum: This was a great little half-day trip. We took the ADO bus from Playa and they drop you about an eight-minute walk from the entrance to the park, which is where the taxis or any other bus will drop you. It was air conditioned and the people were friendly and helpful. The cost was only about $8 a person roundtrip and the entrance to the park was about the same. Our only bad experience with traveling around Playa was from the cab driver who took us to the bus station. He claimed that the bus would cost us $37 each and take us to the center of town in Tulum, which would require additional cab fares. Neither was true, of course, and then he offered a \u201cspecial\u201d price of $80 to get us there. Helpful source: We purchased Playa Del Carmen, Tulum and the Riviera Maya, 2nd Edition, by Joshua E. Hindsdale, before we went and it was very useful. In fact, it helped us know we were being lied to by the cab driver.", "Date": "July 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "kingston", "Title": "\u201cExcellent vacation\u201d", "Author": "zanda2", "ReviewID": "UR33490126", "Content": "We were originally supposed to stay at the Viva Wyndham Maya, but due to the swine flu we were moved to this hotel.

Positives: The beach, clear blue water and cleanliness of the hotel is great as well as most of the staff. The location is good too...not to far from town and they do not skimp on the drinks. Negatives: FOOD-The food is awful in the buffet (I am NOT a picky eater either!) I love almost all food but found this buffet to be seriously lacking in everything...just really, really bad. I did not try the retaurants, so I cannot comment on them. Also, the snack bar is bad too in that it is served buffet style..although clean, you cannot get any freshly cooked food which was a disapointment and it is all junk food except for the fruit. No iced tea either for those of you, like me, do not care for soda. ROOM SERVICE-It is advertised w/24 hr room service which is incorrect..only goes until 11pm and you can ONLY order literally coffee, stale hard crescents or yogurt for breakfast and only a hamburger (warning-not true hamburger meat) or a sandwich and fries for lunch or dinner. No salt, or pepper given and the ketchup is some kind of homemade orangy red stuff. They discourange you from ordering room service with the lack of room service breakfast order menu (I only got one-had to ask for a second one and never got another). They also have specific times for even ordering room service. There is NO CLOCK in the room, so I called in at 6:50am one morning to try to order coffee because yet again I got no breakfast order menu and was literally laughed at by the FRONT DESK (SO not good customer service) saying it wasn't time yet and to call back in 10 minutes! The front desk also put my incoming calls on hold and dropped some of them (you cannot call the room directly) from the US (expensive to say the least). The front desk also did not offer any helpful info regarding the property (regarding the restaurants, nightly entertainment or ANYTHING regarding the resort and all)..Just slapped a wrist band on you and gave you your key. I checked in when the wasn't anyone behind me either, so there really was no excuse. I have stayed at enough of these resorts to know the protocol but some other couples I met did not know about making reservations, having to put a cover-up over their bathingsuits to eat at the buffet or where the nightly entertainment was or when it even started. The rest of the staff were nice but they truly need to revamp their front desk help!! HARD BEDs-beds are never truly soft at any hotel but this one was literally like sleeping on a wooden plank. I confirmed with some others that theirs were too. I think the tile floors would have been the same sleeping experience. I definitely won't be back...I'd rather stay (for a bit more money) at DREAMS CANCUN-now that was a fabulous place...everything top notch!!

Because of all the good reviews for the Azteca, I thought we'd give it a shot. Then, the swine scare happened, but we decided to go anyway because it seemed to have calmed down. I'm so glad we did; they check your temperature at the airport, but other than that it was no big deal. And it was awesome at the resort because we had our pick of lounge chairs: in the sun, under the palapa, close to the beach, far from activities, by the pool, etc. and this was anytime of day. There was no crowd to contend with when at the buffet or the bar. In fact, we didn't even see anyone at the Riu next to us until the 2nd to last day. This made the beach pretty sparse and great for a run in the morning and relaxing later. I thought the food was excellent. They had plenty of fruit, all your breakfast staples, and it seemed to me that the variety was great. For dinner they'd have little stations set up so you can have tacos made, or fajitas, etc. as well as chorros, banana fosters, cotton candy made in front of you, different flavored tequila shots, cosmos, champagne, martinis, the list goes on. We did see one of the night shows, but didn't last long there cause it was kind of cheesy...but I give them kudos for trying. The show wouldn't be bad if you had kids, though, and it's something to entertain yourselves with. We even found a sports bar behind the theater with a big TV playing some basketball games, which was pretty cool. There is a lady trying to get give you a free gift in the courtyard area, but we just told her we were fine and kept walking. She is trying to sell timeshare and is very annoying. Also, don't stop and talk to anyone at the airport, they're just trying to sell you something. Just keeping walking out to where the taxis are for your ride. You don't want to waste any precious vacation time arguing with rude timeshare people! Our room was spotless, as was the resort itself. The beds were definately hard, but that didn't keep me from sleeping or enjoying my vacation. AC worked perfectly and it was almost too cold in our room. Fridge was always stocked. I do recommend tipping the maid every day, and we did tip the staff and bartenders, but I never saw anyone else tipping and we were never badgered for a tip, we just did it out of appreciation. We did eat at the Mayan restaurant and the Bamboo restaurant at the Azteca, and the food was good both times. But my husband had to wear pants since you're supposed to dress up and he didn't like that, so probably next time I don't think we'd book the a la carte restaurants since the buffet was so good anyway. Also, none of the restaurants are air-conditioned, everything's out in the open. My husband is hot natured, but I was just fine. The bar by the pool is open 24 hours, and the drinks are pretty good. The beach itself was beautiful with sparkling blue water and soft sand, all kept immaculately clean. We did go to Playa and I'd recommend the Pinatas restaurant (calle 4) and La Tarraya (calle 2). They're both right on the beach at the beginning of 5th Ave. We had shrimp ceviche at the Pinatas restaurant and it was excellent, and we had fish tacos and pina coladas made from actual coconut milk at La Tarraya and it was delicious! Also, since they're on the beach, you can eat at a table right on the beach with your toes in the sand and after your meal you can go for a dip...so cool. However, I would definately recommend NOT going to Playa during the middle of the day when it's the hottest; go either in the morning or evening when it's cooler because that sun will definately drain you! We also went cenote snorkeling with The Mexican Blue Dream (look up their reviews, they're great) and it was an awesome experience. Overall, we were completely satisfied with this resort.

This hotel has almost a \u2018homey feel\u2019 about it. It is not a mega-property; it is just the right size. Many, many hotels in the area/region are just closed, due to lack of occupancy \u2013 it is tragic. This area needs to have people return, and soon. To our understanding there was not even a single case of flu in the Yucatan, but the news scared everyone half to death, and now these people are suffering. The hotel staff is great. We decided the restaurant wait staff looked like bees going from flower to flower as they ran (literally) from table to table clearing dishes, etc. The bartenders, never made you wait for a drink; and house keeping is amazing. The first morning we woke up and noticed the guests next door had checked out. There was a \u2018mountain\u2019 of laundry \u2013 sheets, towels, blankets and even the rug between the beds \u2013 ready to be laundered before the next guests arrived. (Have you ever seen a room completely stripped, including rugs, between guests? This place is taking every precaution to make sure you have a safe stay while here.) If you leave a tip for the maids, you will get 'towel animals' on your bed \u2013 really cool! The beaches there are WONDERFUL; you will see shades of blue you didn\u2019t know existed. And enjoy the giant sand bags used to control beach erosion. You will find a variety of fish around them and they make a cool place to sit and relax if that is your thing. ((Use caution, they can be slippery.)) BE SURE TO TIP EVERYONE. This is a tourism economy and needs to be boosted back to normal. Shuttle van drivers, bartenders, wait staff, excursion van drivers, guides, everyone. Even a few dollars from you can mean a LOT to these folks right now. The excursions are great. The Chichen Itza trip is a very full day, but really interesting. Xel-ha is a blast. You can learn about both locations at your hotel through travel companies. (We used Best Day travel for our excursions. They are VERY professional and can provide you with a lot of trip options. Even shuttle service from the airport. Obviously I cannot say enough about the great hotel and staff at this hotel. You will find it to be reasonably priced, and very enjoyable. Just go\u2026.you need the vacation and - they want you there.

The hotel is smaller than a number of the hotels along that strip of beach in Playa, so it was nice that we didn't have to walk 10 minutes to the beach from our room. The food was typical all-inclusive quality, nothing really exceptional, but there were plenty of choices so we really had no complaints there. The Animation staff worked hard to make sure people were having fun. We both liked that they are encouraged to join the hotel guests for lunch and dinner. Twice we were asked by different Animation team members if they could join us for lunch. The rooms were exactly as pictured on their website, so there was no surprise there. My only complaint would be that the beds and pillows are awfully hard and not the most comfortable.

As some knew from my experience with trying to get a direct flight there & back, the flight there was a complete nightmare. I missed my direct flight b/c of an accident on the expressway. I was trying for days to get a direct flight & then I had to miss it! American put me on the next available flight which had a quick layover in Miami - needless to say the layover was not quick because the connecting flight was canceled & delayed three times. I arrived in Playa 10 hours after my original scheduled flight! Check in was smooth since there was no one there. Headed straight to my room which was supposed to be a king size bed (called the hotel before my arrival to confirm) but had a room on the third floor with no view of anything but a building with 2 double beds. Room was small & musty. Quickly went to the front desk & was able to change to a room (last one available supposedly) with a king size bed on the first floor. Perfect for me! The room was still musty smelling & the A/C was BLASTING!!! Had to literally shut it off. The bathroom was interesting - no tub or shower curtain, just a shower head & a chair. I felt like I was in prison. Didn't matter much because I spent the entire day from 8 am until 6 pm at the beach. The pool is small in comparison to the photos so I hit the beach instead. Azteca has the nicest beach on that stretch in comparison to the other hotels. Walked up & down & noticed the difference. Sand bags weren't a problem at all - quite fun! Playa was definitely my favorite since I spent my evenings there just partying it up. Service at the restaurants was lacking. I travel to Mexico quite frequently every year & this hotel had the worst service in comparison to the other hotels I've stayed at. Now by \"worst\" service I'm not implying that it sucked - just was non-existent. Plates would sit at my table for at least 10 minutes before stacking away at the table. Was never offered coffee once so I just served myself which was fine by me. That was my only big complain about the hotel. The cleaning crew was awesome - by 9:30 am my room was clean & the bathroom was dry! The hotel is in need of an update in regards to the rooms but since you spend a good portion of the time outside, it's not that bad. Food was great when it was fresh but not much variety. One night for the dinner buffet there were pork chops & those were the best I've had in a long time! All in all I would recommend it to someone who wants to go to an AI & get the best bang for your buck & loves the fact that Playa is literally a 5 minute drive.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cExcellent vacation - annual all-inclusive travellers\u201d", "Author": "LetsGoTravel75", "ReviewID": "UR30536327", "Content": "My wife and I visited (our 5th trip to Mexico and 3rd to Playa Del Carmen) the resort from May 8-15 (we booked in April) after deciding to take a practical approach to the flu situation. We had been originally booked into the Viva Maya but it was closed due to lack of tourists (this is a big problem for many larger hotes right now and I suspect it will be for months to come). The biggest problems were the flights as US Air was scrambling to fill flights. As a result we lost our direct flight from Boston, as well as an extra delay in Charlotte for a cancelled connection. Once arriving, however, everything went very well. The Azteca is a very nice, albeit a little on the small side all-inclusive. One of the best things about our trip was the hotel was at only about 20% capacity (no waiting for anything). So if you like lots of tourists around you, now is not a good time to go. A major advantage of the small size, however, is that the beach, pool, rooms, dining areas, entertainment, etc. are all only a short walk from each other. The grounds were well maintained and the staff was very efficient and friendly. Check-in was a breeze, and the desk staff was very accomodating in fulfilling our request to change to a ground floor room. The rooms were nice and cleaned daily. The food was very good with a different theme each night. Each night featured a different cocktail station (martini, magarita, etc.) on the large patio next to the restaurant. There are also dining tables on the patio if you prefer to eat under the stars. They have 3 a la carte restaurants - Japanese (very good) and we did not try the Italian or Mayan. They have a theatre with nightly shows which were entertaining. Yes, they are not professional shows, but who cares, it's vacation. They have two large bars - one next to the pool/beach, and one in the dining/theatre area. They have an internet center (pay) with 3 terminals. I think the best feature of the hotel is the animation (activities) team. There are truly animated and go out of their way to engage everyone in activities, or at the very least put a smile on everyone's face. Note they also do the shows with some outside help. On the beach are the usual non-motorized water sports (snokeling, kayak, catamaran, scuba). A staff member will even take you out on the catamaran if you don't know how to sail. If you are a beach walker, go right when facing the water (left has retaining walls in front of private residences that you can't get around). You will have to walk on a short wall along the properties that are near the hotel but its all sand after that. Downtown Playa Del Carmen is only a 5 minute $5 cab ride for up to four. Go to 5th Avenue because that's the big tourist shopping district. It's also full of restaurants, bars (watched a hockey game in a sports bar), live street entertainment and so on. Return cabs can be found all along there. The is also an outdoor mall within walkin distance from the hotel that has many shops. A good tour to take if you are adventurous is the Mayan Encounter $109 (ride a zipline, walk thru the jungle, rappel down into a cenote (water hole) for a swim, and finally climb the pyramid at Coba). As for any negatives, there are a few but not deal breakers. Yes the beds are a little on the hard side - they seem to be everywhere we have gone. There is no pool bar if that is really important to you. The beach is nice with white sand but there are huge sandbags out in the water to keep the beach intact. However, the seawood is taking hold on them so they are starting to look more like they are part of the ocean terrain. Also, they do cut down on the waves and thus create some \"quiet\" areas to swim in which I think is a plus.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "alberta", "Title": "\u201ccouldnt be better\u201d", "Author": "rpmcnee", "ReviewID": "UR30496199", "Content": "if you can go now, GO!! very friendly, friendly and sexy dancer, nightly shows were awesome. couldnt have asked for more from a trip. windsufting was great, pool usually had a volleyball game going, food was excellent (with exception of the 24 hour pool bar - but thats reasonable cause you cant let most foods sit around all night). love that staff. very funny, very lively. we didnt join in our first couple days cause we wanted to just lounge but after that we did everything. gym was well equiped, nightly dancing was fun - gotta keep requesting them away from the techno music though. we will probably go back to this resort all the way from canada.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maple, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cvery memorable vacation\u201d", "Author": "Ivana13", "ReviewID": "UR30293658", "Content": "We just got back from the Viva the end of April, we were there for two weeks.I must say this was one of the most enjoyable vacations we have had.

All the people working there from the grounds keepers to the bartenders were always extremely friendly and helpful. The animation staff was friendly, but not intrusive. Rooms \u2013 We had two rooms that each had two double beds, a small balcony (only suitable to hang towels and bathing suits on, no room for chairs), large closet, mini bar and full bathrooms. The rooms are a good size and the bathroom has the added perk of having a separate sink outside the shower/toilet area. The cleaning staff did an excellent job cleaning our room every day in a very timely manner. Restaurants \u2013 The buffet had a great selection that changed daily. Between the four of us we probably tried just about everything there was to offer with no complaints. For dinner each night there was a different theme. Mexico night was exceptionally good, especially the freshly made churros. We did try three a la carte restaurants \u2013 the Italian one at the Azteca, and the Mexican and Seafood restaurants at the sister resort Viva Wyndham Maya. We enjoyed all three restaurants, with the Mexican one being the favourite. We also tried the buffet at the Maya once and it was good as well with just a little more selection than at the Azteca. The 24 hour pool snack bar was also good for a quick bite. Pool \u2013 Pool is on the small side, but very enjoyable. There are plenty of loungers around the pool as well. Note that many of the loungers around the pool are in the direct sun. Beach \u2013 Plenty of loungers available whenever we went to the beach. Volleyball, bocce catamarans and kayaks were all readily available to anyone who wanted to partake. The water was very nice for swimming. While we avoided the anti-erosion sandbags in the water lots of people used them to lay on for sunning or diving off of. Location - Located in the gated community of Playacar we felt safe walking in the area at night to the local market area or to the sister resort. Playa Del Carmen is a 5 minute cab ride away. Local Shopping \u2013 The plaza in Playacar, had very nice stores and reasonable prices. We actually ended up going back there to buy souvenirs after checking out Playa Del Carmen and finding the goods, especially the silver, not as nice or higher priced. The Walmart in Playa Del Carmen, which is within walking distance of the main shopping area, came in handy for stocking up on sunscreen. Viva Wyndham Maya Sister Resort \u2013 This is much larger and busier than the Azteca. The beach, pool and restaurants are similar to the ones at the Azteca.

After about an hour of trying to get through to Hertz we gave up and just took a taxi to the Hertz office and they immediately took care of the problem. Good service finally. What I can say that is Good about the resort are the free bikes, that make getting around Playa very convenient. The other is the food is excellent.

We were not initially looking to go to the Mayan as we were there last year, but found a great last minute deal on this resort and after the requisite research on TripAdvisor decided to book. Result = Another great experience due mainly to research done on TripAdvisor. For some background last year we stayed at a 5+ star just north of Playa del Carmen. This year we went for the purposes of doing absolutely nothing but veg on the beach and by the pool. We're not big partiers. Our stay at the Azteca this year was in most respects equal if not better than our vacation last year which cost considerably more. This is based on the following: - Accommodations: As we arrived at night our initial impression of the room wasn't the greatest. The safe wasn't left open by the previous guest and as such I couldn't open it and the screen door on the patio was off the track. I fixed the door in three seconds and called about the safe the next morning and it was ready to go within ten minutes (literally). In the light the room looked much nicer. It was basic, but very very clean. We also had a problem with a leaking A/C and again, it was fixed and the water cleaned up by housekeeping within twenty minutes of phoning the front desk. - Food: Excellent. There is a different theme on the buffet each night. We only used two of our three \u00e0 la Carte options as we always found something we liked on the buffet. The Asian restaurant was excellent. They could use a bar closer to beach though. There is no swim up bar. - Service: Excellent. Staff were consistently friendly and helpful. They also seemed very happy and were always joking amongst themselves which is great to see. - Activities/Entertainment: The entertainment staff were simply amazing. Although we didn't participate in any of the activities, the level of effort put forth by the staff was very impressive. They were a bit aggressive in trying to recruit participants at times, especially if you're there just to veg, but considering the size of the resort this is understandable. The nightly shows were excellent. I can't say enough about the level of energy and effort put forth by the staff. - Location/General: Resort is situated in a \"gated community\" of sorts consisting of resorts, condos, private homes etc called Playacar. The resort is about a 20 minute walk to the town of Playa with lots of shopping and nightlife, and a 5 minute walk to the Playacar tourist market. Bear in mind this is a small resort. You can't get a quiet spot by the pool, and the beach is only so big but you can get more privacy on either end. Resort grounds are beautiful. We're big beach people - this beach was great. Despite the \"geo bags\" protecting against beach erosion which don't look so nice, the beach was great. Not rocky or weedy. It was windy though and we were forced to the pool by the blowing sand a couple days. Internet access (in business centre) was fast and reliable. Long distance phone cards are sold for 100 MXN (DON'T call on your credit card! Learned that $50 lesson last year). Lots of TV channels including BBC and CNN International versions.

Liked Least: Lack of quiet areas due to resort size.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNothing to Worry About\u201d", "Author": "travelbugz2006", "ReviewID": "UR28179197", "Content": "I just arrived back from a 1 week stay at the Viva Wyndham Azteca. I have chosen 5 star properties in the past so I was a little worried before going (this resort was listed as a 3 star plus)-the worries were unfounded. This resort is great value for your money!!!! Before booking I had a few questions about this trip to the Mayan Riviera and this resort-hopefully if any of you have these same questions you\u2019ll find this review helpful Question 1: Should I be worried about safety on the resort and in Playa del Carmen? -NO!!! The Azteca is located in the gated community of Playacar which houses numerous other resorts. Within this gated community is a shopping area only about a 5 minute walk from the Azteca with a variety of stores, and most importantly a Starbucks!!! Q2: What is the food like on the resort? -The resort is small with one main buffet, 24H snack bar and 3 ala carte restaurants-Italian, Mayan, and Asian. The Azteca tried very hard to offer guests a wide variety of food items at the buffet which changed daily for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. In fact dinners had a different theme each night. Themes included-an Italian night, Spanish night, Seafood and Asian. There were a few staple items each day including Nachos (the sure bet as they are very good), hamburgers pizza and fries. Also available daily is made to order pasta which never disappointed. As a guest at the Azteca you can book a la carte restaurants at the sister location the Viva Wyndham Maya about a 5 minute walk away. For our 3 reservations we chose; the Mexican Restaurant at the Wyndham Maya, (my favorite ala carte, I had enchiladas and a fantastic churros dessert), the Asian (have the fried Ice cream) and the Mayan at the Azteca. Q3: What is the beach like? -As the traveler\u2019s photos show- this beach does have the large sandbags in the water. The biggest drawback about the beach is that in either direction the beach is pretty short. So if you\u2019re looking forward to taking long walks on the beach this is not the property for you. Beside the Azteca on one side is the Riu beach and then some private property where the beach ends. The other side of the Azteca Beach is cut off by the deck of the next resort over and if you want to continue past this there is a moat of water created by sandbags about waist deep. We spent each day on the beach and got our loungers at about 8:30 in the morning. Later in the mornings we did see people lying on their beach towels as all the loungers were taken. If you are fond of sitting by the pool it looked like you had to grab your chairs even earlier. Q4: What are the rooms like? -The rooms are kept very clean and are quite comfortable. Thank goodness they had proper pillows which is a problem I've encountered at other resorts. Bathrooms had two sinks which I thought was fantastic-no wasted time waiting your turn to brush your teeth. Our room was located in the building closest to the main lobby and furthest from the beach but the beach was still only about a 2-3 minute walk. The only negative about the room was that it connected to an adjoining room through a door that did not offer a lot of sound proofing.

We have a daughter who is 8 and a son that is 12. They had a great time and plenty of activities to keep them occupied. Just remember that it is a destination spot for people all around the world so you will see some things that you would not see here in the states. For example a family visiting from Holland allowed there daughters to go topless at the pool. The girls appeared to be between the ages of 9 and 11 so of course my daughter had some questions about that. We were also caught of guard by all of the topless women on the beach. Our 12 year old son brought that to our attention right away by the big smile on his face. Both children made friends with other children and hung out with them in the pool, on the beach, and in the kids club. The kids club is an area for the younger children to play and watch movies. The staff plays games with them in the club as well as in the pool. The staff also takes them to lunch. This allows parents to get a bit of a break while on a family vacation. While our daughter was at the Kids Club we stayed at the pool which is within eye sight. For our 12 year old son, they had beach volleyball tournaments, soccer games, ping pong tables, and dart competitions. The sister location 5 minute (walk) had a trapeze. For the adults, my husband took full advantage of the open bar. They have water aerobics, step aerobics, and salsa lessons (in the shallow end of the pool) and various other activities. The sister location offered yoga by the pool. The gym was small but decent. The food was ok. We could always find something at the buffet to eat. We ate at the Japanese Restaurant and the Italian restaurant (reservations required for both). The food was excellent (much better than the buffet). There was always plenty of food on the buffet (breakfast, lunch, and dinner). They also offer 24 hour room service (included in the all inclusive package) - this was a hit with the children. They ordered hotdogs and brownies at 10:00 at night - the things that you can ONLY DO ON VACATION!

The hotel is very clean - the staff are constantly busy cleaning. This is a small resort and so everything - pool, rooms, restaurants, bars, beach is close together. We were there during spring break and we found that the majority of people there were either couples or young families. We liked the italian and mayan restaurants best of all. We dined in the buffet restaurant several times and the selection of food was always good. I particularly liked the whole suckling pig they had one night. There were never long queues for either bar or for the food at the buffet. The reception staff were excellent - we were given some good advice on places to visit. I recommend snorkelling in a cenote, it was a great experience. The beach was nice, apart from the sandbags are a bit of an eyesore - although I realise they are there for a reason so there's no getting around it! We borrowed bikes to go into playa - much cooler than the walk. A couple of days we were out and missed lunch, not a problem, there is plenty to eat at the pool snack bar. I would only say two words of warning - this is not the hotel for those who want a rocking nightlife (we didn't so it was ideal for us) and if you want a lounger by the pool - you need to be up with your towel before 6am. We looked out at 6.15am a couple of mornings and they were all gone, but who cares - a towel on the beach works just fine for me. Overall a good hotel for the price we paid and a great holiday.

We had a marvelous time at this all inclusive resort and feel that the vacation was well priced for the amenities offered. We especially enjoyed the courtyard where the meals were served and the large beach palapa and bar by the pool because there was a nice breeze there. The staff were very friendly and helpful and it was a very clean resort. It was located in a gated community called playacar which is just a short walk to playa del carmen. The rooms weren't fancy but there were very clean and each room had a bathtub and a shower. We only ate at two a la carte restaurants because we enjoyed the buffet so much and preferred the food there. The theme nights in the courtyard were very nice and they went to a lot of effort to create a great atmosphere. We felt that the food was very good and there were lots of choices. We are from Canada and we heard some people complaining that the food didn't taste like it does at home. It is not reasonable to expect to go to a foreign country and have food like you do at home. The beach is beautiful although it was a bit rough and we couldn't use the kayaks due to the conditions. However, this is no reflection on the hotel itself. The fridges were stocked with beverages, and there was a free safe in the room. There were no extra fees or charges and we booked through sell off vacactions and it was a signature package. Even the departure tax from Mexico was included in the cost of the trip. My only complaint would be the fact that people put their towels on the beach chairs to reserve them and left them there for hours. I feel that if they weren't using the chairs, they should remove their towels so that other people can enjoy them. We enjoyed the cappucino's at the bars and the special drinks: conga, dirty monkeys, and coladas. A highlight of our trip was the Alux restaurant which is located a short cab ride from the hotel. It is a restaurant that is located in a cavern with a charming atmosphere and entertainment. This is not to be missed.

It really helped us manage our time since this was the first time we have been to this part of Mexico. We were in Pureto Vallarta last year and prefer this side a lot better because of the history and superior beaches. We ended up going to COBA for the day and that was well worth it. We got to swim in a cenote and see a mayan village. with the ruins at Coba, there you can still climb up the pyramid. And, if you go on the tour it would be advisable to rent a bicycle taxi there. It can be hot and the walking there and back can be draining. Location: With the Azteca and sister resort, Maya located in Playacar which is a gated community, there were never any concerns about safety which was one of the issues we had after hearing about the problems up in the northern part of Mexico. The cobble stoned roads and landscaping along the whole area really made this area feel like it was separate from the rest of the country side. so much so, that we ended up renting a scooter ($30. /day) from the info booth across from the hotel and we used it to see the rest of the Playacar area and to go into Playa De Carman (5 minutes) on a couple of days and evenings with it. This also allowed us to go into some of the side streets where the locals had their shops set up and to experience some of the local foods and stores that are parallel to 5th avenue. We did this in the late afternoon and felt perfectly safe, but at night it can be a little hair raising since there are a lot more traffic and you can get turned around if you are not familiar with the area. It also helps to know a bit of Mexican if you venture away from the tourist area. Back to the Resort.. With the Azteca being a smaller resort than the Maya it did not take long to get from one area to another. The buffet restaurant had a nice array different foods to satisfy all eaters. There was always fresh papaya , pineapples, honey dew and cantaloupes all day !!!! They even had a Turkey on night and another night there was a whole Dorado fish BBQ. We have to admit that were tried mostly all the dishes that were served and each one was an adventure in taste and presentation. My personal surprise the cactus salad !! The salad bar had great variety, and there was even a station for low sodium , low fat foods. We really enjoyed the theme nights that they had at the resort. We managed to hit the Latin and Asian nights which offered the foods for that culture. This did not mean that they did not still have hot dogs or pizzas for those that were not as adventurous. The evening show is a must to see if you can stay up that late. It\u2019s at 9:30pm every night and they have a different show every night for 13 nights.(for people lucky enough to spend 2 weeks there.) It\u2019s all do by the same staff that you see during the day that sets up the aqua aerobics, salsa lessons, dart games, pool volleyball and a whole bunch of other activities. I\u2019m amazed how the staff that eat and sleep in their non-air conditioned rooms, on the resort with some paid as little as $25. a day still have a smile and still so full of energy to put on such an amazing show. A la carte restaurants .. There are 3 at the Maya and 3 here at the Azteca. Our fav was the Xe Ha \u2013Mayan and Bamboo-Chinese It was nice that for these restaurants the dress attire was long pants for shirts for men, and no jeans for ladies, it just makes it a little more special. If they insist on a dress code on the cruises, why not here. We also liked the fact that to get to the sister resort the Maya it was only a 5 minute walk over and along the way you will hit the vendor area that is located across from the Maya. In that area there just happens to have a Starbucks\u2026along with other clothing and jewellery vendors. We enjoyed the fact that we could make that walk over earlier before our dinner reservation time and sit down have a drink ,check out what they were serving at the buffet restaurant and then after dinner enjoy a nice walk back. Since reading all the other reviews regarding this place, I did not want to be reeating the same things, but one \u201cfree trip\u201d offer that I have to mention is the one for the jewellery factory called LAPIS. They offer to pick you up and drive you to their location which is about 30 miles down the coast. There was suppose to be a tour and then you can shop and buy their diamonds, silver etc. We got picked up by bus, they picked up a few more from other hotels and when they dropped us off at factory, there was NO tour whatsoever. They gave us a tag based on which hotel we were at(I think this allows the sales people to see who were the ones staying at the 5 star resorts, and had money to spend) and when we walked into the show room a dozen sales people swamped and followed you. THAT WAS THE TOUR!! So, unless you want to spend your time and money there , don\u2019t bother going. (we saw jewellery by the same designer on 5th ave. that was cheaper.) Ending on a positive note, would like to thank the staff at Azteca for being so accommodating, .we needed a first floor room since my wife has a bad hip and they came through for us. The bus pick up from the airport was uneventful(only about a hour ride, but we were offered Corona beer for $2.00..that an import here in Canada.) And from the resort to the airport we did not have to stop at all , and even though the bus was later picking us up, Signature phoned the hotel to let us know so we still had our hotel room when we needed it. Please feel free to email me if you need more info.

The staff accommodated my request exactly, and we had great rooms close to everything. The hotel itself was spectacular. Grounds were well maintained, and the overall setup was great. We especially liked the courtyard area, which was a great place to just chill out and meet people after dinner. The restaurants were great...we mostly stuck to the buffet, which had awesome pizza. The best though was the ribs night. We also ate at the Italian a la carte and mayan restaurants. The Italian was so-so, and the mayan restaurant much better. However, we were always fed well, and especially liked the selection at the snack bar. The staff was also great - with special compliments to Nelson and Olver, who were the bartenders at the snack/pool bar area. We went to the Viva Maya a few times, and noticed that lines at the bar area were significantly longer than any we encountered at the Azteca. Animation staff was fun too - we really enjoyed just hanging out and talking to them. They were all really easy to get along with, and were never overbearing. The beach was definitely one of the better ones in Playacar. We were always able to get beach chairs in the morning, although we did get out there to save seats by 7AM everyday. This was quick and easy to do since our rooms were near the towel and beach areas. We also loved the free bike/lock rentals that the hotel offered. We rode from the hotel into downtown playa a few times, which takes about 10 minutes each way.

We were VERY impressed with the resort. The resort is small and easy to navigate and perfect for families with young children. It was really easy to keep track of where everybody was and only a short walk to either the bar, room or pool. We've stayed at resorts in Cuba where we would have to walk 15 to 20 minutes to get to the beach and had sore legs after the first few days so this was a special bonus for us. A highlight for us was the ultra friendly service at the Azteca, every employee at the resort seemed to walk around with a smile. Small problems with room access cards and a few other minor issues were always resolved immediately with a smile, we were really impressed. Also impressive was the nicely landscaped grounds and freshly painted buildings. The place looks like a five star ! The Room: The room was fine, nothing fancy but clean and functional. Our room (1133) face the back of the resort and was admittedly not in the most pleasing location because there was no view and it was rather dark but we only used the room for sleeping so it wasn't a big deal. Don't get crazy if you don't get an ocean view, you'll spend little to no time in the room anyway.! One note however, the hotel seems to have a policy on not allowing families with kids under 12 to have a second or third floor room for insurance reasons. Some of the clients were blasting the Signature rep Jack because of this. It certainly wasn't his fault so give the guy a break it's not his fault. Remember that you're there to spend your days relaxing in the ocean or sunbathing so all you need your room for is to change and sleep. The mattresses are hard but we slept very well regardless. Overall, we pleased with our room and really have nothing to complain about. Food: Our 6 previous trips have been to Cuba and the buffet at the Azteca was like a five star compared to what we've had in the past. Honestly, my expectations where quite low after reading most of the reviews here at Trip Advisor. We were very pleased with the quality and selection at the buffet. The food was always hot and tasty and the selection are really good compared to other resorts. We had no problem getting reservations at the three restaurants. Of the three, I think we liked the Bamboo the best which served a Mexican version of Japanese food. It wasn't authentic but it was very good and served in a fun atmosphere by a very entertaining waiter. Our second favorite was the Italian restaurant, everybody in our group enjoyed the food and great service. The pork cutlet, grilled beef, chicken and pesto pasta were all enjoyed by our group. Last but not least was the Mayan restaurant which is in a lovely outdoor setting. The atmosphere and music were really nice but we were least impressed with the food simply because it was the most exotic of the three. It's not that the food wasn't good, it was just that the taste of the sauces were very different from anything we've ever eaten before. Once again, the service was impeccable. Bar: The bar area was great. Drinks were the best we've ever had, served garnished with fruit in 8 ounce hard reusable blue plastic glasses. It was nice to see a resort thinking about the environment for a change. They were usually on the strong side so I don't know why somebody mentioned that they were watered down. They also have a huge selection of different brands and a menu of the tropical mixed drinks they serve. All of the ones I tried were great including once of the best Mojitos I've ever tried. Surrounding the bar is a great snack buffet where you can get tasty pizza, hotdogs, burgers, rice, pasta, fries and a selection of three different fresh cut fruits. Our favorite was the nachos, you can make your own with their great salsa, to die for guacamole and cheese they provide. Be careful of those fresh cut jalapeno peppers mixed with the tomatoes though, they are five alarm. Delicious !!!! There was rarely a line up and I never had to wait more that a minute for a mixed drink. The bartenders were always friendly and seemed happy when receiving a tip. Beach: The beach is the best were saw in the area, the sand bags are a bit on an eyesore but it's otherwise perfect. The waves were large and the red flag was out for three days so you have to be careful with your little ones. When we walked down towards the Wyndham Maya, there was a strong sewage smell on the beaches there to the Azteca beach was truly the best of all of them in my opinion. Animation staff: We enjoyed the animation staff. Don't forget that it's their job to keep people entertained so don't rudely turn your nose up to them. Jessica and Lauren work long 12 hours days and still find the energy to make people smile, good for them ! They are also asked to eat with the guests at lunch and supper so don't be offended if one of the staff sits down with his or her plate of food at lunch. This is part of heir job and they do it well.

They ask you and if you say no thanks, they move on. The pool is very clean and well maintained. We went for the beach. Yes there are large sand bags on the beach, but these are there to help keep any remaining sand from being pulled out to sea. Still the beach is in good condition. You can walk to the sister hotel via the beech. You can also walk the beach until the hotels stop. One thing we liked is that you can use all the facilities at the sister hotel and no additional charge. You are getting 2 hotels for the price of one. The nightly entertainment was very good. A different show each night. Since I am a Scuba diver, I highly recommend the dive shop at the Marina hotel. It is only a 3 minute walk along the beach from the Viva Wyndham Azteca. The ownerr Gille and his partner are extremely professional as are there staff. If you go diving ask to either Karen or Javiar leed you on your dives. They are very good and professional at what they do. They make you feel very comfortable both on land prior to the dive and in the water. I did 4 days of diving. 3 days along corrals reefs and the last day diving amongst the Bull sharks. Karen made me feel safe when we reach the bottom and the sharks started to approach us. It was the best dive I have done, since I started diving. Gille I will return no questions asked. I took my wife and our friends snorkeling, using the Marina dive shop, and they all agreed that the staff ws professional. They saw small sting rays, small squids and numerous colorful fish.

We had booked in December and felt we got a good deal and were diligent in checking Trip Advisor on this hotel as we were a tad skeptical. We didn't need to be. It was an awesome holiday and the resort was great! The resort was very clean and well maintained -- you always saw them working on the grounds and the rooms were cleaned very well and swiftly. One night we had a leak in the ceiling outside the bathroom, but minutes after calling the front desk they were there and had it fixed and we didn't have any more trouble with it. We appreciated the fact there was a safe in the room and used it. The entire staff was wonderful and friendly. Enjoyed the entertainment and sports staff (Lauren, Jessica and Ahra???). Also Oliver was one of the bartenders at the poolbar and he made excellent lime margaritas. All waiters and waitresses were great. The food was very good at the buffet with lots of variety. We ate at the Italian and Mexican Al a Cartes and they were also very good. We went down for dinner to the sister Maya's buffet one night and the food was good, but the atmosphere was much more 'cafeteria' like. Preferred the buffet at the Azteca. We only took in the Friday night entertainment and I was sort of wishing we had seen more their shows after seeing the entertainment staff all week at the resort. They are nice, fun, energetic young people. We went over to Cozumel on the ferry and rented mopeds. Ferry tip: If you are not sure exactly what time you want to return, just buy a one-way ticket as there are two ferry companies and they leave at different times. You can always buy a return ticket in Cozumel. Also the mopeds: very fun, would recommend doing this or renting a jeep, but remember to have your driver's license and they charge you an extra $10/moped for insurance. For that afternoon we had a Snorkeling Catamaran booked from the pier in Cozumel with Fury Catamarans. We had booked this through Fiore at the hotel. What a great time! Stopped at two snorkeling spots where we were able to see a stingray, baby sea turtle, grouper and some other tropical fish. Then we went to a private beach for a BBQ with 'real' Black Angus burgers (tasted very good). This excursion also included beer and margaritas and alot of fun and dancing with the crew on deck on the return ride to the pier. A must do! Most mornings we walked the beach 30 mins. to the south and the same back checking out the neighbouring resorts and picking up shells. It was breathtaking. I think if you put towels on beach chairs by 9:00 you could have secured them, but there were less chairs around the pool. We really enjoy meeting our friends in the lounge before and after dinner and eating breakfast in the courtyard. We took the bicycles out a few times and really liked having this option to go into Playa del Carmen. Would go back without a doubt. Wish it was next week.

A little background: This was our 4th trip to the area once in Playacar area and twice in the Akumal area. We did this trip with no kids so relaxation was our main goal. We booked our trip thru Orbitz taking advantage of the $200 off deal. To maximize our stay we choose to take a red eye and this put us into Cancun a little after 9am and to the Azteca by noon. Room: We had emailed the hotel about three weeks before our stay to confirm our reservation and request room number 1101 per the description from a nice Trip Advisor member. We got the standard response that they would see what they could do. We ended up in room 1104. This is the north section, ground floor, closest to the beach. As it has been mentioned at the Azteca the balconies and patios for most rooms are quite shallow, this was not the case for 1104. This room actually had 2 patios, one facing the pool which was regular balcony depth and covered. The other patio facing the beach was the real treat it was roughly 10' X 10', again covered with grass and flowers/shrubbery all around. The room itself had a very large king size bed, yes hard =] Two night stands, each with a drawer and open space below that, a table with the tv taking up half of it(no drawers), a small bench for the table and a mirror above it. Then a round wooden table in the middle of the room with two chairs for eating, drinking..etc..good sized. Kitchen area had stainless steel sink, coffee maker, microwave, dorm fridge and two long shelves above the counter(no drawers but open space below the sink) The closet had two drawers and two shelves above that with one more shelf that ran the length of the closet. Plenty of room for hanging clothes on the non-drawer size of the closet. Room safe didn't work and when they came to fix it they couldn't get it to work either so they replaced it with a non keypad type...regular key one. We ended up not using the safe but keeping one suitcase on the stand and using our lock on that. We figure if somebody really wants stuff in your room that bad they are going to get it anyway ;) Bathroom was a little smaller than we expected but served it purpose fine. Water was only luke warm first couple of days but by the end it was quite hot. I would suggest bringing your own soap, shampoo...etc.. but that is just my opinion. At times as reported on Trip Advisor, we came across the sewer type smell, more in the hallway than the room but not that big of a deal. Food: El Nopal is the buffet found just inside the entrance. Good selection of foods as with any buffet things tend to look real familiar about day 6 =] Different themed nights more on this in a minute. Seating was always easy to find...and you could sit inside or out. For breakfast the omlete/egg station was always the most crowded but wait wasn't that long and this way you could be sure was fresh. The food on the line did tend to get cool not sure if they weren't heating the serving pans or what, anyway just your standard buffet really. We made reservations for three of the a la cartes right after check in on the first day with no problems. We based these on the themed nights at the main buffet.. for example we wanted to do the Japannese night at the buffet so we made reservations around that night. We did the Portifino at the Maya first, not crowded, easy walk over. The food presentation was great, the service great, except the appetizer the taste not so good unfortunately. Next we did the IL Palco the Italian at the Azteca next to the main buffet. Here we had a female waitress(not very common in Mexico) who was great. She was funny, very attentive and did a great overall job. The presentation here again was outstanding this time the taste also matched that level. Our last reservation was for the Hacienda Don Diego but we ended up stuck in Playa Del Carmen and didn't end making that one. Lastly the pool bar had snacks thruout the day that were quite good. We lived on the fresh Guacamole (mix a scoop of the salsa in) and chips found at both buffet and pool bar. Beach: The beach area was great. Sure you have your sand whales, but you had two areas...the main swimming area with 2 or three whales about 20 yards out and then a 20 yard wide channel next to that with no whales where they launch beach toys(hobies, jet skis...etc...) Plenty of palapas and palm trees to keep you shaded, yet plenty of areas in front of that for full on sun. Chair saving...yep, most definitely going on but it seemed like if you got out there before 9 you still had pretty good options. We are early risers so we would go out and grab a couple of chairs, sit with our coffee and enjoy the sunrise. Water had more waves than I remember from our other visits, but this made for some fun body surfing and boogie boards in the channel area. I even got to rescue an Italian lady from the Riu with my boogie board. She had gotten behind the whale but also too close and got slammed a couple of times into it. There are topless women there, a handful I would say, but none at the pool as there are signs saying it isn't permitted. Just a warning for those that might be offended by this. Excursions: We only did one and that was on our own. It was the Jungle Place(Monkey Sanctuary) down by Xel-Ha. I am doing a separate review on that but I will tell you it was great. We took collectivos from Playa Del Carmen and taxis from Chemuyil. We did also get a massage in Playa Del Carmen, from Magic Hands. It was $59 or 770 pesos for 60 minutes side by side, it was good deal and a good massage. Staff: The staff was great, everybody was friendly. The events staff tries to get everybody involved in the games but not too pushy. Maid service was good, we left two one dollar bills each day on the pillow and always had the fridge restocked and extra towels. We didn't make any of the shows as this has never been a big interest to us. Atmosphere: This is a bit interesting, up until the last 2.5 days the mix was very Italian and Canadian with a fewer Americans and then Friday that started changing I am guessing because of spring break. Maybe it was just the type of people that show up for spring break but we will take the European mix anytime and we are Americans ;) Random Thoughts: Internet access is not to bad on site, 3 computers, $2.50 or 250 pesos(use pesos if you have them) for 30 minutes which don't have to be used all at once. We found a couple of open wifi connections in Playa Del Carmen to use the iTouch on. Also a place on 2nd and 15th that had big lcd's, fast speed and cost 10 pesos an hour(roughly 75 cents) Taxi into town 50 pesos each way although we always walked as evening temps were great. Places are running an exchange anywhere from 10 to 13 pesos to the dollar and right now that rate is above 15. We just used the atm at the little plaza across from the Viva Maya. In conclusion we had a great time and pouted most of the time on the shuttle back to Cancun. We will of course be going back again to the Riviera Maya and would have no qualms about going back to Azteca. I apologize for the length of the review but figured I would try and answer all the questions I had going in and why not be thorough.

We borrowed the bicycles and went to the Wyndham Maya for lunch one day - was it ever hopping. We were so thankful to be moved to the Wyndham Azteca because we were in the mood for a quiet vacation. Each property gives you a different vacation experience. There is an outdoor shopping mall across the street to buy local arts and crafts. The whole Playacar area is a gated community containing at least 15 hotels which make it very safe to travel between the hotels and to the shopping mall. The room was very sparsely decorated. The food was very good at the buffets and exceptional at the a la carte restaurants. There is definitely variety of food choice. The activities staff is probably the best part about this hotel. The beach is sandy and there are a lot of beach chairs and private huts for shade. We never found a problem finding space no matter what time of day we arrived. We didn't go on any sightseeing trips because we had a short trip. This is a really good vacation spot and we will stay again if we go to Mexico.

Restaurant service was not quite as capable, but I always got coffee when I needed it in the morning. I am not a fan of \"all inclusive\" and this experience did nothing to change that. In general, buffet food is just that...buffet food. No matter how good it might be, it sits in warmers and turns mediocre. It was almost impossible to get a reservation at one of the 3 a la carte restaurants, although I did finally get one for one night. The food was OK but not great. I checked in at the hotel at around 2pm and was told I could not reserve for that night because the reservation desk closes at 1pm. The next morning at 8:05am the reservation book was already full. Funny thing, when I walked by the restaurants in the evenings, there were always empty tables. But, there are great restaurants in Play and I walked or took a cab ($5US + tip) there each night for dinner and drinks. The Breakfasts at Viva Azteca were quite good, as were the french fries and nachos at the pool bar during lunch. The bartenders were great, housekeeping did a great job and the entire staff was pleasant and helpful. My only gripe is that by 9am each morning, guests had placed towels on lounge-chairs all over the pool and beach area and it was impossible to find an 'open' lounger, though none were occupied by bodies...just towels. I simply tooks towels off the loungers and piled them together and used the chairs. Nobody every showed up wanting to claim their chair while I was there.

I travelled to the Viva Azteca with my colleague in December 2007. Basically, we were sent there by the company we work for (Thomas Cook Canada) and we really didn't have much choice of hotels. We stayed there for a week and we're still talking about going back to this day. Service was amazing from the start, we arrived at around 1:30 am on a Friday night, and we were brought up to our room with our luggage. Check in was quick, friendly and effective. From then on, we just loved our vacations. The food was amazing...even the buffet. The only restaurant the didn't enjoy as much, was the Mexican restaurant, but it was still very good, just not as amazing as the other a la carte restaurants. We had access to the Viva Maya restaurants as well, and we loved the food there too. The drinks were amazing, and the bar tender was great, quick and effective also. The daily activities are just so amusing and the staff was more that awesome. We played volleyball, did some kayaking, spanish lessons by the pool/beach, dance lessons etc. The nightly shows we very entertaining too. We assisted every show, and just loved them more and more as the week went on. The great part is the staff goes down in the lobby after every show and they come pick you off your feet to dance for an hour or so. Jonathan, Omar, Andrea, Dodo, Fiore; they were all amazing and sweethearts! Whats great about the staff too, because its a small hotel, they recognize the people staying at the hotel, even outside of hotel grounds. When we went to a club the second night, we were kinda getting \"bugged\" a bit by a few locals, and they popped up from nowhere, showed us their i.d. from the hotel and took care of us from then on. I've never seen that from any other hotel i've stayed in! Anyway, if you want a great place for famillies, girlfriend getaways, romantic getaways etc., don't hesitate, this place was more than we expected from a 4 star. Amazing food, amazing accommodation, amazing staff. The beach was one of the nicest considering the damage caused by hurricanes (walked to the Riu Palace next door and I pitty the people who paid for a 5+ and there was no beach at all, just rocks!).

We don't care for Aisian food, so we did not book there. I am very picky, and I found great things each time in the buffet. Took a walk to Playa a few times, and a long stroll into PDC. We took a cab back it was too hot to walk back and be comfortable. Besides, more time for the BEACH if you took the cab. $5.00 was well worth it. FYI, there is a WalMart in PDC in case you need things. It is on 8th Ave. The beach...OMG, it is WONDERFUL!! I did get up early-5:40 every day to reserve chairs, but that's what you have to do if you want a pallapa for shade. MOST people respected your spot. The beach is lovely! You can walk and walk. The sand is soft and not hot at all. We walked to the Maya, Sister Hotel to the Azteca. Much bigger, not as quaint. Glad we stated at the Azteca. Yes, there is only 1 bar in that beach/pool area, but it gives you a chance to stretch your legs. Ya can't lie around ALL day. LOL. The animation Staff were fun, sweet and silly.

They gave us a key to check out another room farther away from the noise. We looked, it had a teeny, tiny balcony which you could NOT put 1 chair on...we decided to stay in our original room. The music is off at midnight. We did not know that the first night. We were so glad we did not switch rooms. Everyone on staff was very nice and would try to assist you in whatever you needed.

People just get bothered by certain things and that will make or break there trip. So with all reviews you have to read into what people are complaining about. We traveled with a large group of family members over the christmas break. Ok so what is different about this hotel and the sister hotel 4 doors down that is called the viva wyndham maya. The maya is bigger, more \"life\" if that is what you are looking for, and the trapese.....oh yeah also you can walk right accross the street to a little plaza with a bunch of shopping. The wyndham had decent food, nothing fancy but good food. A great pasta bar, fresh grilled fish everyday the best damn pico de gallo and guacamole ever. I ate it every day twice a day. They had the standard mexican flare.....decent breakfast buffett, fresh squeezed juice in the morning only. staff very friendly. work very hard. We drank the water they gave us in the restaurant, and used the ice. No one in my family got montezuma's revenge. BUT WE DID NOT BRUSH OUR TEETH WITH TAP WATER> WE USED BOTTLED WATER. That water is unsafe. keep your mouth shut in the shower too. some people call the activities staff anoying but just say no and they will leave you alone and it helps as the activities during the day make for fun watching. also the beach is very sandy, and plenty of shade if you want it or sun if you want it. The towel cards get annoying, but helps to prevent people from hogging chairs but that still happens too. We only ate in the mayan restaurant.. it was decent. gym small but ok. pool nice, not huge but nice. Rooms were fine. Standard middle class room. Tile floor, sliding door with deck, bed, bath, clean linens.......TV. not much more to say. It was fine. no issues. Oh...tip the maids the first day and you will get great service. don't wait till the end. I gave my maid a $20 and I had far better service then those that waited. What I really liked about the hotel is that they had bikes with locks, and you could sign them out and bike to Playa del carmen. lock them up and walk around. Very fun. also the nightlife at playa del carmen is like nothing i have ever seen. I am 34......IT IS NUTS!! the amount of people, the way the tourists and the locals party.......holy cow! We danced one night at 3 different clubs and bars till 4am. so fun. That was it though. That wore us out. there were a few losers selling cocaine, marijuana, etc..... The waters out infront of the wyndham are very packed with jet ski's sail boats, and of course parasailing. Everyone in my family liked this hotel and we would come back for sure. Just so you know we are not a fancy family. Just your normal or semi abnormal family!!!! The kids in my family had a great time. Ages 7-14. There was also a snack bar at the pool area, they served light lunches and snacks all the time. At late at night they had late night snacks to soak up the booze. We paid during christmas break about $1,000 per person. We felt we got what we paid for. If you look at trip advisor and read the reviews and the overall rating you will see it gets four stars or four dots....I feel that is very fair. If you want ritzy titzy 5 star go somewhere else. If you are looking for a good resort and a good price. This is a great place. If you want nightly entertainment.......its fair at best.....Go to playa del carmen and you can have all the entertainment you want. $5 cab ride each way Oh one last thing...Excursions. We found that if you book an excursion through the excursion desk you waste so much valuable vacation time. Here is what happens, a bus picks you up, then you spend hours going to other hotels picking up more people till the bus fiils up. then on the way home the same freakin thing. We went to Tolum and Xel HA.......2hrs down, 2 hrs back That is 4 hours. Just so you know that XEL Ha is about $70 entrance fee, Tolum is about $4.00 Do the math, get a cab/driver it will be about the same and a much better experience. I found tolum fair at best. Tons of people. XEL ha was over rated but if you have kids go for it. If not don't Also our family did an ATV trip out to a Cenote(fresh water caves) and it was fabulous. Not to long. About an hour ATV trip each way, got to swim in cenote's. FUN. And only a half day. We dove the cenote's too. That was really neat.

Our family just returned from one week at the Viva Azteca, and would recommend this resort to anyone looking for a good quality resort with decent food and all the basics and a relatively quiet atmosphere. The Viva Azteca is a clean resort with a great beach and is ideally located a 50 peso taxi ride from Playa del Carmen. The grounds are lovely and well kept. The food and the rooms at the Azteca compared very favourably to other 3.5 and 4 star resorts we've stayed at elsewhere. Typical of all inclusive buffets, the dishes do tend to be repetitive, but there was always a good variety to choose from. Our biggest complaint was that hot foods were not very hot. For the Al a la cartes, we ate at the Mayan restaurant, the Italian restaurant, and the Meditteranean restaurant at the Viva Maya. We would certainly recommend the mediterranean where the steak was very good. The beach and pool area were good. The pool was cold until the weather warmed up. The atmosphere at the pool/beach was quite suitable for families. Our children (ages 11 and 16) enjoyed the entertainment and games put on by the activities staff...again typical - boche ball, darts, dancing, survivor type games. For those wanting more of a party atmosphere, we would suggest the sister hotel Viva Maya. We walked down the beach (4 hotels over) to visit a few times and found alot younger crowd, busier, and a \"party-mode\". This also meant service was slower at the bar. The service at the Azteca was great. All staff were very friendly at all times. The rooms were cleaned well and comfortable. We were put into a room on the backside by the lounge (C unit) the first night (we arrived at 3:30 a.m.), which smelled very musty and was in a very poor location. However, when we asked the following morning if we could change rooms, they did not hesitate to move us to a much better one facing the pool. We do have one warning, which is not really about the Viva Azteca...we purchased a tour to Xel Ha from the Signature Tours Representative stationed at the hotel. We highly recommend this full day tour, however, be careful what you pay for this trip. Signature charged us $119 US per adult and $71 per child (high prices), plus converted the US to pesos at 14.8 (too high exchange rate). This way, as Canadians we lost on the exchange to US dollars and again on the exchange to Mxn pesos. The tour price includes air conditioned bus to/from the park, and once there it is all inclusive. However, others we met took alternate transportation to the park itself where the all-inclusive day pass is about $70 US per adult (may even have a peso price?). If you are Canadian, whereever you go in the Playa del Carmen area, ask for the peso price and not the US dollar. For example, a cab ride from the Azteca to Playa del Carmen is $5 US or 50 pesos. $5 US is more like $7 for us, while 50 pesos is under $5 Cdn. The other trip we took was to Cozumel to snorkel. This was fabulous - some of the best snorkeling we've ever done. Beware of the ferry ride over (can be very rough and many get seasick). Price is $140 pesos per adult each way. We purchased a glass bottom boat snorkel tour from a vendor at the Playa del Carmen ferry side for $1400 pesos (family of four).

My teenage boys had fun with the other games the event staff put on through out the days as well. The beach was perfect. Not overly crowded like the sister hotel \"Maya\". Yes you will have to be up by or before 7am to reserve your loungers. (get over it...I did). When you go to the beach you will see \"Sand Whales\"...really huge sand bags to help preserve the beaches since Hurricane Katrina. The water was great waves were big enough for body surfing. Some days were to rough for other water activities. One tip about beach volleyball....lots of sunscreen on the tops of your feet...ouchie...lol. The rooms were great...yes as you have read beds are hard....you'll sleep fine. Rooms are impressively cleaned.(tips#2...tip the maids everyday...don't go crazy on the tip...but show your appreciation) The small fridge is stocked (few pop, beer, juice and water) on a daily basis.The bars are great too. My family never found the drinks watered down...my kids got the \"Non Alcohol\" version of some drinks.(Loved the fact that they had Canadian Club) You can as for double shots if you want. There is a gym with cardio machines...spa...internet(with a fee), roof top tennis court. Playa De Carmen is a respectful 10 Min walk to your right from the hotel (average pace) Great shops and restaraunts for an evening out. Cab is $5 from there back...(if you don't want to walk back with shopping bags) Less then 5 min to your left is a little plaza. Yes there is a Starbucks. On there resort there is a photcompany that will take your pictures of you with small animal...also you can get them to take a \"little\" photo shoot of you and your family. They do take some great pictures and they show you after dinner on computer screens. The event staff are crazy...they want you to join in the activities (do it...have fun...you're on holidays) They're all great dancers...they put on nightly shows....The best one by far is The Lion King (don't miss it!!!!) I will admit though some do have adult humour so be warned...lol. My family loved the resort and we will be going back again. Thanks to the staff for making it memorable.

Also, the espresso is available all the time - this is not your gas station espresso, but REAL espresso. Yum!! The food overall was pretty good. Lots of choices.

The things we enjoyed were the wonderful, friendly staff, the open courtyard, the cozy bar with comfortable chairs, the Mayan restaurant, the beach with lots of palapas, the small scale of the hotel (i.e. not as many people milling around). We were a little disappointed with our room and the buffet. We were supposed to have a superior ocean view with a king bed. Well, we had the king bed (hard - although we got used to it after a couple of nights) and the ocean view, but to call the room superior would be a stretch - very spartan in terms of decore and furniture. Some rooms had balconies over looking the ocean, but our tiny balcony over looked the pool and you could squeeze 2 chairs on it if you put them sideways. But the room was very clean and always looked after. The buffet was certainly adequate, and we sure never went hungry, and the staff were excellent, but it just wasn't as elaborate as some we have seen. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience, and I would certainly pick it again over those huge impersonal hotels. I don't understand how anyone could say it was a horrible experience, as all we saw were happy people, thoroughly enjoying themselves. We actually met one couple who were returning for the 9th time.

I'll get them out of the way first. 1. There were three separate instances of items going suspiciously missing around the pool/snack bar area. On our second evening, a gentleman left his travel iPod speakers on a pool lounger. We were sitting nearby and saw someone tidying up the pool area for the night. The man came back for his speakers to discover they had been taken off the lounger .. somebody had hidden them in the bushes to probably take later. A laptop in a pink case was left for no more than fifteen minutes on a seat at the snack bar. When the owners came back for it, security and bar staff claimed to not know a thing about its whereabouts or having seen anything out of the ordinary. An electronic game that we brought was accidentally left at the pool bar on a table for fifteen minutes very late one evening. Pretty much the only people around were again bar and security staff. We went back for the game and once again, no one could tell us anything about it. 2. The second complaint I have is what I believe is some sort of negative treatment to customers who speak English at the front desk. On the very first night we checked in, we found our room to have a strong, unpleasant, septic smell. We called the front desk, and were told that since it was late at night, there were no other rooms available for us to switch into. Ok, no biggie. The next day, we ask at the desk about another room again, as the smell had not dissipated. We also were expecting two friends to join us in our room that night, so wanted to change into a room with two beds. The male receptionist (Alessandro?) told us there was nothing available to switch into. Ok, cool .. whatever. Then our friend walks in basically off the street (doesn't have an existing room reservation at all, as he was planning to stay in our room) and is able to magically secure a room with two beds. What is even stranger is that he walks in off the street and manages to get a VIP wristband in silver (we had the regular red ones). I attributed this to his knowledge of conversational Spanish and didn't think too much of it. A few days later, this friend and his roommate try to have their stay extended at the front desk. The English-speaking friend talks to the desk and is told that their rate would skyrocket to ~$180 per person. Later on, Spanish-speaking guy talks to the front desk and gets it back to $108 per person. Finally, their amenities book describes late check-out is available for $25 if one gives them 24 hours advanced notice. We went to the desk to ask for this the day before we left, but were told that we would be on a touch and go basis and that we had to check with the desk on the day we were leaving. It was really no surprise to me that something they describe as an available service was unavailable to us after all. I believe I overheard the chief of reception ask one of the other receptionists what colour of band we were wearing in Spanish. \"Rojo,\" he said - which means red. She mashed a couple of buttons on her keyboard and then told us that late check-out was not available to us. I'm sure if I spoke Spanish better or if I had a silver wristband, I would have been able to use this service. Perhaps it is b/c my partner and I appear young for our age that reception never quite took us seriously, but we are respectful, paying customers; and it shouldn't matter how old you look, what language you speak or what colour of band is on your wrist to be treated courteously! ================================================ ROOMS: The negatives about the room were that sporadically, it would smell like the septic system was backing up ... but then the smell would go away the next day at random. Sounded like the neighbours were IN our room due to the fact that our room was connected to theirs with a door. I could hear them snore, get ready and even hear them zip up their luggage! Dual sinks were a nice touch; maid kept the room very clean and left us towel animals pretty much every day; good selection of tele channels for those hungover days; having room service ordered in was SLOW though. FOOD/DRINK: Buffet was hit and miss, but unless you're restricted diet-wise, I think you'll have no problem finding items that you like to make up a good meal. My favourite a la carte place was Il Paco, Italian. I was rather impressed with the cappuccino machines and the nice selection of liquors they had. They typically will use a more generic brand unless you ask for a liquor by name. My boyfriend and his friend were eventually cut off from bar service even though they weren't that drunk on one night. They hypothesize this was the case b/c they kept asking for the nicer liquor specifically. I was told that the bar staff are only paid 45 pesos per day. That seems really low .. maybe in dollars then?? Either way, that is a sad wage in Canada, so please remember to tip them. Thanks for reading my long write-up. If it seems like I complain a lot, it's only because for good experiences, people tend to say one thing, for not so good ones, it's easy to say ten things!

About 4 years ago we had stayed at the sister resort - Viva Maya and when we were looking to book a holiday with the kids we didn't hesitate to try the Viva Azteca knowing we could still enjoy the services of the Maya.

There is plenty of beach area to enjoy and if you get up early enough to claim your beach lounger a day of relaxing is yours to be had. My only criticism is to the fellow vacationers who claimed beach/pool loungers with a towel but never actually used the lounger which is very rude to those who would like to claim and use the perfect spot by the pool or beach.

Pool and beach: There is only one SMALL pool and it get's crowded very quickly. Consider getting up at 5:00 am to go and reserve some pool chairs. Not a problem getting a spot on the beach though. The beach is very narrow and there are tons of huge sandbags so you can't really swim in the ocean in front of the hotel. Playa Del Carmen (5th Avenue): You must go! It's only a 20 minute walk.

When I got there to check in around 3PM, the told me that all the restaurants were booked and I would have to eat in the cafeteria. How could eating in the cafeteria be all inclusive. I paid up for absolutely nothing. What is worse of all, is that the concierge lied and told me that the receptionist clearly told me of the policy. I pleaded with the concierge, who left at 4PM for the day and she basically said the waiters might be nice and let me in. She was not helpful in any way shape or form. The hotel clearly does not want to satisfy customers and in fact, all of the behind the desk employees seem not want to raise a finger to help anyone.

At the outset, this is NOT the place for honeymooners. The entire place is full of families - I think we may have literally been the only people there as a couple with no children. I don't mind children running around, so it didn't bother me, but if you don't want to hear children screaming, this is not the place for you. Of course, we went over Christmas week, so maybe at other times its more couple-friendly. Other than that, the hotel was completely adequate. My husband and I mostly lay on the beach for the entire time. The activities staff was fun, but mostly left us alone after we said we didn't want to participate. You can't blame them for doing their job. During Christmas week you had to wake up REALLY early (830 am) to get a chair, but after New Years it calmed down and you could get a chair at 10am. To the guy who complained about \"butt holes\" stealing his chairs: uh, yeah, if you leave your chair FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, someone will take it. It's one thing if you leave for 30 mins for lunch, a totally other thing if you leave for a few hours. These aren't YOUR chairs, if you're leaving for a few hours you should be courteous and give it to someone who's lying on the sand. The buffet was OK, there were a few things that were good and a few that were just OK. If you like guacamole, this is the place for you - they must go through 500 avocados a day. Part of the problem is that they try to cater to a lot of different nationalities, so the food may not be in everyone's comfort zone (like the deep-fried hot dogs - yuck). We tried to eat all our dinners in the restaurants, which was no problem - in the 9 nights we stayed, we ate at restaurants for 5 of them. We were never told that there was a \"limit\" to how many times we could eat in the restaurant. If you find the food that abhorrent, you can go to town onto one of the back streets (you can even borrow a bicycle from the Azteca to get there) and get tacos for literally 50 cents each. The rooms were clean and the beds hard, just like everyone else says. The cleaning staff made animals out of towels, which was always something fun. One day we got a brontosaurus and we were so impressed we took pictures. The shows were nothing to write home about - the shows at the Maya were better. My one tip is to avoid booking trips at the hotel. We booked our trips in town and saved more than 50%. For example, the trip to Chichen Itza through the hotel was $100/person, but in town, the exact same trip was $40/person (and would probably have been less if we bargained). All in all, it was a good value for the money, and a good place to go if you have kids or don't mind kids running around.

It was on the third floor right on the beach shore with a fantastic view. The room was huge and had a jacuzzi with a separate shower. It was nothing short of spectacular with a balcony where we could sit and listen to the ocean. The buffet was acutally quite good, and this is a huge compliment because I am a very picky eater and I do not like buffets in general at all. There was a lot to choose from so there was something to satisfy everyone's palette. If they have the pozole....get seconds! It was the best that I have had in several years, unfortunately they only served it once during our 6 night stay. We also never got a chance to try the rotisserie tacos, they only had that once too. If you choose to make reservations at their a la carte restaurants, make sure you do so at the very beginning of your stay as they book up very soon. I thought you could only make one reservation per day, but apparently you can book them all in one visit. Also, if you plan on doing excursions or tours, make your reservations for later in the evening in case you encounter delays or traffic (like we did and missed our dinner at Xul-Ha which must be spectacular since we couldn't book it until our 5th night there). The staff is very friendly, and Alesandro at the concierge desk was very friendly and always willing to help. Lauren from the entertainment department was really fun and always get a fun group to play some volleyball in the pool. Bartenders Luis and Carlos always made a quick and tasty drink. Our housekeeper, Ericka had cute towel animals waiting for us with an impeccable room. Overall, our experience was 5 stars all the way. The only complaint that I had was that the outdoor jacuzzi did not work the entire visit, although it was made mention more than two times. I do believe that this doesn't reflect on the resort, but our VIP gift ended up being a masked timeshare presentation, which was actually pretty convincing. The only drawback is that the hotel consultant told us it would only be a total of 60 minutes and that we could have our breakfast while listening to it, but the presenter actually said they required 90 minutes. Not good news when your flight is leaving that afternoon. Also, you have to prod them to give you your thank you gifts, they do not do so voluntarily.

There is no disco at this hotel however there is a sister hotel called Viva Wynhdam Maya (3 times larger) that has one and we ended up going for dinners, shows and disco there. The show's at Azteca weren't that nice however at Maya it was a lot nicer. The food was also better at the Maya so we ended up going for dinners there more often.

We love Mexico for its people and service and always will be happy to go back there. Most likely we will not stay at his hotel anymore simply because we like bigger hotels where there is more things to do having said that this hotel was pretty decent as well.

It was a great trip because I had the opportunity to spend time with my family and friends in Azteca. However, though the resort was all-inclusive it did have ups and downs. When you first enter Azteca it is fairly nice, comfy and the staff are somewhat welcoming (you receive a drink). The rooms are decent (beds slightly hard), but if you're a outside bird, then the rooms aren't really a big deal. Azteca also offers many activities and utilites which are great. They have two bars with a variety of drinks. They have many sports, such as tennis, windsurfing, sailing, lying on the beach, ping pong and various activites run by fun \"staff\". (The unique part about Azteca is the staff. They are really fun, easy going and if you like playing around then you should come here.) They also have three restaurants: Mexican, Italian and Asian) And lastly, they also have their nightly shows which run at 9:30 pm, ending with a little dance party with the staff, and actors. Though Azteca has all this amazing stuff, not everything can I say was top quality. First of all there is only 1 turf tennis court on the roof of the hotel, therefore limiting the amount of time you can spend there. The bars though unique, sometimes have staff which can be a little annoying/frustrating espcially if you don't speak spanish. The sailing is only on catamarans, and you have to take a lesson with them before they let you out alone. The staff though fun, can annoy you if you are just laying on the beach. (Not a place for people who just want to tan and relax) The restaurants in order from best to worst are Italian, Mexican and Asian. If you're Asian, don't expect too much from that restaurant, especially the sushi. And the last complaint I would say is wind surfing. I would not recommend going to it simply because of the service. Of all the people probably the wind-surfing moderator is the worst. He only takes 2 people a day for one hour max, and if you're not very good, accidentally forget to come, or he doesn't like you don't expect a lesson. To sum up my lesson: \"1,2,3,4,5 Pull up the sail.\" And actually I only got a split half an hour since he was late. Not to mention I came everyday for 7 days, to have him say there is too much wind. Literally I only got a 30 minute lesson in a two-week trip. If you want to learn windsurfing go somewhere else. Anyways overall I cannot say the resort was bad because it had everything I wanted although some things were not at the best standard. I would recommend anyone with families to go to this resort as its fun, somewhat relaxing and enjoyable. The food is not bad, and the service is decent.

AT BEST it's a 2-1/2 star and that's only because of the entertainment staff. We had a two people in their early 20s and the entertainment staff was great. Full of energy at all times. The nightly shows were not \"Broadway\" caliber by any stretch, but oddly entertaining. Unfortunately, the front desk personnel are rude and unhelpful. The biggest disappointment was the fact that while the hotel's website advertised multiple restaurants from which we could choose for dinner (this is SUPPOSED to be an all inclusive) is was a total nightmare trying to get a reservation for dinner for 8 people. We stayed 5 nights and had to literally ARGUE with the restaruant reservationist. ARGUE with the \"supervisor\" and it was still an effort in futility. Be aware -- we were told AFTER THE FACT that the restaurant reservations for the Azteca are LIMITED to 4 people (and that's a fight to get even 4) regardless of your party size. We were also told that even though we stayed five nights (4 rooms) we were \"limited\" to only \"one\" reservation at one restaurant for the entire stay. Buffett for the rest of the stay. That story changed depending on who you talked to. We somehow managed (after a HUGE scene and argument in the lobby on the morning of our last night) to get a \"special\" accommodation for all of us for dinner at a restaurant at the Maya (the sister hotel down the street), but the dinner situation completely ruined the tone of the trip. We are a FAMILY and wanted to eat together and enjoy our time there. What a joke it was to get any accommodation at all. The rooms are nothing special. We had a third floor room and the \"balcony\" was literally 6 inches deep. If you have large feet you can't even stand out there. The first floor rooms have small patios where the hotel puts which plastic chairs. The beds were very hard. The cleaning staff was very efficient though and the rooms were clean. Hats off to them! One of the rooms we were given (we had 4 -- 2 people in each room) had plumbing issues every day. The maintenance staff was called 3 times. Finally, the boys in that room ended up using another room's toilet because theirs would not work. The beach was crowded. The pool was ok, but no swim up bar. The drinks were from a menu so you could order nothing other than what was on the menu. No free internet service in the \"business\" center. $2 for 30 minutes. Overall, the hotel was a huge disappointment and if we were not with our family, it would have been ruined by the rude and unhelpful staff at the desk and reservationists.

Nonetheless, we were looking for a place where we could simply be lazy - lay out on the beach, not worry about drinks and dinner and maybe take advantage of the facilities.

Our mistake may have been underestimating the sometimes cheesy aspect of all-inclusive-bingo-merengue-tug-of-war-egg-toss-peddling hyperactive-impressively-multinilungual-activities-staff (camp counselors) We sprung for an ocean-view room ($144 using AAA discount) and got what seemed like one of the best rooms there - 3rd floor, facing the ocean, at the very beach-end of the resort. Our room was actually enormous, probably big enough for two king begs - the bed was reasonably comfortable. Housekeeping was great, stocking the mini bar and cleaning thoroughly, and sometimes swinging by with unexplained candy treats. The beach was nice, but the water was barricaded by large sand bags, which was fine, but sometimes resulted in an accumulation of seaweed, etc. The meals were pretty OK. The breakfast had anything you could ever want (the fruit selection and omelette stations were nice), lunch was basically a miniature version of the dinner buffet, which was very nice, and illustrated the staff's hard work: great mexican chili, a sushi night, a pasta station, a barbecue night, whole fried fish, etc. We also took advantage of four of the six in-house restaurants: Italian, Oriental, Mayan and Mediterranean (at the Wyndham Maya). All of them were a nice change from the buffet, but nothing special, except maybe the Mayan one within the Azteca. We ended up using the gym quite frequently, which wasn't very big, but wasn't very popular, so worked out rather nicely - elliptical, treadmill, stair-master, two bikes and all the standard free weights and cables. We also played Tennis one day, and although we are not very good, we would guess the court wasn't the best, but a nice activity anyway - maybe bring your own balls, as there's looked like they may have been chewed (jk, lol). The staff was very accommodating and nice (aside from the often obnoxious activities mongrels) and we really enjoyed our stay.

We stayed there from Dec 7-14, so we've just arrived home on Sunday... I would not recommend this resort to any friends or family...The beds were extremely hard, more like sleeping directly on a box spring... I now understand why they supply \"stretching\" classes on the beach every morning! The food was not good..... greasy and tasteless. We only ate at the buffet for the first three days of our stay and just couldn't stomach it any more. I'm not a picky eater either, just expected better. We ended up eating dinners outside of the resort. We travelled with a fairly large group (9 in total) so others that did eat at the restaurants said that all of the restaurants were below average...The same food that was at the buffet, but only presented differently and it was served to you. Apparrently the Italian restaurant was the worst of the three. Personally, I would spend the extra $300.00 per person to stay at a 5 star, since we ended up spending that on food outside of the resort anyways. The 24 hour \"grill\" was not good either...... hot dogs and hamburgers only, served with french fries... there was a salad bar, but very slim pickings at that...... the hot dogs and hamburgers appeared to be under cooked, but I believe that it was just the colour of the \"fillers\" that they use..... Unlimited nacho chips with pumped cheese out of a dispenser... hmmm.... I guess I was expecting a little more of \"Mexico\" with their food presentations and selections, rather than \"stadium\" food... Actually, stadium food is better... The drinks seemed to be tastless and non alcholic... and very sweet.... The bartenders only made drinks that were on their \"menu\", so asking for something different was out of the question.... We're not heavy drinkers anyways, but don't expect the \"good stuff\" unless you're out of the resort. If you're going on vacation for a good night's rest and decent food quality, this is not the place to go !! The animation staff seemed to be arrogant in nature to the \"working\" staff. There was one day that the animation staff had a cooking class on the beach. Once the class was over, they just abandoned everything and left it for the seagulls..... The working staff ended up cleaning up after them, obviously resentful of the behaviour. There was one gentleman that had just arrived 3 days prior to us leaving, that was part of the animation staff... His name was Nico and he was very friendly, sweet, personable and sincere... I will say that the housekeeping staff was very efficient. Our room was always clean upon return and the overall resort was clean too.. Water pressure and temperature for showering was good too. The gals that worked in the money exchange booth we're well versed on many languages and they too were efficient and friendly.. The beach was beautiful! You could see the lights of Cozumel from the beach at night... I'll admit that prior to leaving on our holiday, I was apprehensive of the man made sand bars, but they didn't hinder the beach environment.. Unfortunately it was cloudy and chilly for the week that we were there, so we didn't get alot of beach time.... Not the resort's fault... The location of the resort was great.... we were only a $5.00 cab ride to 5th Ave and a 2 block walk to the Playa Plaza.... Seeing how other resorts are located, the convenience of the Wyndham Azteca was second to none.. We checked out the sister resort the Wyndham Maya. Exactly the same, only larger. Again, the small resort was good and it was not over populated.... We spent a day in Cozumel...... if anyone is interested in going, please go to Coconuts...... This restuarant/bar is amazing... the food was great, the service was fantastic and the best margaritas in Mexico!!!... beware of the walk to and from the parking lot.... it's a good way to tell if you're too drunk to drive !!! The view from the restaurant is spectacular, you'll want to stay all day ! The only excursion that we booked was to Tulum/Xel-ha...... The beach at Tulum is breathtaking and the Xel-ha waterpark is a must see for any snorkler! The food was very good at the water park and the service was 10 out of 10 ! Our trip was booked through Signature... transportation to and from the airport was smooth and the flights were good too... Our group was extremely disappointed when we tried to book our excursions through their rep. When we returned to book, the representative was late and they did not have any visa slips for purchasing our excursions... cash or American Express only. Though apologetic, it was not sincere... We felt like an inconvenience..... We booked our excursions through the staff at the hotel... same price, but service with a smile!!! The only other warning I have for travellers to Mexico..... if you plan on taking back any alcohol, it must be packed in stow luggage and not carry on..... Pack it carefully! If packed as carry on, it will be confiscated.. We had the unexpected surprise of having to repack our suitcases at the airport to accomodate the tequila we bought to bring home... and this will go against your allowable weight.. Ours made it home safe and sound, thankfully !!! Best yet, buy it at the airport in duty free, once past security.... Then it will go as carry on... The last thing I do want to mention... if you're hungry and thirsty while shopping 5th ave, we stopped at a restaurant named La Capricho.... We had dinner and drinks there overlooking 5th ave..... great food, great service, and unbelievable people watching!! Not too pricey either......

Also, found the restaurants to be just o.k., and prefered to eat at the buffet - we felt the food there was much better.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Azteca\u201d", "Author": "jjb73", "ReviewID": "UR22697309", "Content": "We stayed at the Viva Wyndham Maya last July and decided to give the Azteca a try over Thanksgiving this year. My family consists of myself and my husband, both 35 and our 15 year old daughter. For this trip, we booked two rooms through Priceline. When we arrived, the Azteca only had confirmation for 2 people, so we had to pay additional for our daughter. This wasn't the way we hoped to start our vacation, but not the fault of the resorts. We are still trying to get our money back from Priceline! As we had requested, we had 2 rooms right beside each other. The rooms were spacious, each having 2 queen beds, nightstand, table with 2 chairs, a counter top with tv and a bench. There was also a mini fridge with juice, soda, beer, and water. Coffee pot with coffees and teas were also in the room. The bathroom had a separate sink/vanity area which was nice for getting ready. They also had Tru Blue Spa bath products from Bath and Body works. So, you really don't need to take shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shower gel, or even after sun cream with you. The balcony was a huge let down. You couldn't even put a chair on it. This bummed me out a bit because I like to sit on the balcony and read! The beach was great. It really is one of the best ones in the area. We used the kayaks, and they also have snorkeling gear, and sail boats. We never made it to the beach before noon and never had a problem getting 3 chairs. We may have had to move them around, but no big deal. There also always seemed to be chairs at the pool as well. The pool was decent sized, but didn't see too many people in it. We booked the Mexican and Italian a la carts. The Asian was closed for renovations. We ate at the Italian and it was very good. However, we never made it to the Mexican because we went to Cozumel that day and didn't get back in time. We enjoyed the buffet. Towards the end, it did get a little repetitive, but always found something to eat. The 24 hours snack bar took care of my pizza and cheese fry obsession, and helped me gain almost 10 pounds! Really liked the lobby bar, and enjoyed sitting there before/after dinner for drinks or playing cards. We went up to the sports bar once. There was nobody there, including a bar tender. We got drinks downstairs at the lobby bar and shot a game of pool anyways. It was very warm in the sports bar though, no air conditioning. The gym was adequate. I used it once, but ended up going running the rest of the time. The internet was $2 for 30 minutes. We used it a few times, however never made it through 30 minutes because it was very slow! I only made it to one show, \"Hollywood\". It was decent. They did short skits/dances to popular movies, such as Titanic, DIrty Dancing, Men in Black, etc . Service was great. The maid always had a smile on her face, and left us the drinks we requested in our mini bar. My daughter called for extra pillows and had them within 5 minutes. The wait staff at the buffet/restaurants were great as well. Always smiling, getting you drinks/coffee, etc. Though the service was great, it didn't seem like they were constantly in your face like at other resorts. We used USA transfers for our airport transfer. I would highly recommend that as well. We had been to the area several times, so we didn't do too many excursions. We did end up getting a free trip to Akumal to swim with the sea turtles. Jorge, at the stand at the Playacar Plaza offered it to us if we went to the Royal PDC to listen to their vacation club presentation. I convinced hubby to do it, and the snorkeling trip was awesom! Saw turtles, sting rays, and other fish. Also went to Cozumel and rented a jeep. Just drove around the island, went to the San Gervasio ruins. Had a massage at Veronicas, and it was very nice. Overall, we love the Playacar area. It is close to everything and has a lot to do. We chose this hotel because we found a great deal on it, and had enjoyed the Maya last year. We loved both resorts, but I think I like the Azteca a bit more. It's smaller then the Maya and a little more laid back.

It appeared clean but as a buffet you will depend on others cleanliness, ie. hand washing. or grabbing food directly from the buffet. I guess this is the norm. We stayed for 2 weeks - opted for a more quiet time on the beach and didn't want to have a lot to do with the staff. They were very good and wanted to do their job but were always requesting people to do the daily darts, step aeorbics, dancing... good for many but wanted to do our own thing. The general staff were very good very welcoming. The room was pretty good. Did have a musty/moldy smell but seems to be the norm there with so much humidity -seemed like more of a problem when we turned off the air. The toilets were a problem overall. Found that they didn't flush well and backed up once. This seems to be a common problem in the resort. The liquor wasn't the best quality but probably norm for all inclusive. Drink the dark dosequis beer... or ask for something if you don't see it up on the shelf as they might have it. Best things: the beach is the best in the area of walking distance along the beach. There are sand bags/whales that protect the beaches from hurricanes and are all over the area. These don't interfere with the beach much here and its beautiful. Our fav part was the beach... The mexican a la carte at the wyndham maya (sister resort, 7 resorts away is also the best of the 5 options for dining. Fun and should see asap.

November 18th to the 25th. This was our 4th trip to the Mayan and our second with the kids. We requested a ground floor room near the pool but ended up with second floor near the pool. We could have switched halfway through but decided to stay. The rooms were comfortable and roomy though the balconies are pretty much non-existant. The grounds are very well kept and the service we recieved was excellent and the staff was very friendly. Beach is very beautiful though somewaht crowded. This was okay as we are more pool people anyway. There was never any issues with getting deck chairs at either the pool or the beach during our stay. The big positive I found here was the kids club. The 2 young women who ran it were aboslutley amazing. They would take our kids for hours at a time and our children both really enjoyed it. This made for a much more relaxed stay for mommy and daddy. The entertainment staff was very good. the nightly shows were very well produced and we enjoyed all the ones we went too. My only complaint about the Azteca would have to be the food on the nightly buffet line for dinner. Mostly bland and repetitious. Most nights the meat selection consisted of chops, undercooked burgers and weiners. Though the last 3 nights we were there it improved with a Japanese and then Italian theme, roast beef the last night we were there. Food seemed to be better on the weekend for some reason. Snack bar was not so good either. Cardboard thin pizza. Breakfast buffet and lunch were okay but dinner could definitley use some improvement. The 2 ala' carte restaurants we ate at were quite good though. I should mention that I'm not really a fussy eater either. Overall what the resort lacked in food service was made up for us in the care we recieved for our kids as well as the entertainment crew.

We stayed first 8 days in Sandos Playcar Beach Resort and then 5 in Viva Azteca. We liked Sandos, it was clean and food was good, but it is too big. Half of the beach was designated to VIP and to get good sun bed with some shade you need to get there very early morning, for sure before 7 am. We get lucky and got room in building near beach, but our friends where so far that they been taking shuttle to beach and they building was not the farthest one. We tried to play tennis but court was booked for days, too many people. Sandos is 5 stars and when it was time to move to 4 stars Azteca we worried that it will be not as good, but how wrong we been. Azteca much smaller and cozier place. I could not see anything wrong with this place. We stayed before in some way more expensive resorts but could not recall that our overall experience was as good as in Azteca. Most of the resorts around are clean and have plenty of food and drinks and this one has all of it to but different from them that it has very nice atmosphere (it feel like you at home). Space near buffet that has good selection and good quality food is set up as it is some squire in Europe with outdoor cafe, with plenty of tables with shade and with out and with some empty room and it is not feel crowded. Beach is one of the best around ( we walked along beach a lot), it is wide with a lot of sun beads (no need to get early to get good spot) with shade and it very clean (a lot of very big and expensive hotels are lucking as good beach as this one). One thing that could be improved is to add beach bar, it is not far to pool bar but it will be nice to have one on the beach. Animation team is amassing. They always around with some activities, and on the end of the day after daily show they have party going in the main bar with DJ and dancing. All bartenders are very good, no water down drinks, and they have high quality spirits for free just need to ask what to be added to you cocktail. One more nice part it is very close to 5 Ave in Play de Carmen, only 20 minutes walk, I think it is only 2-3 resorts in Playcar closer to it than Azteca.

I smiled at him and said you overbooked didn' t you ?? He bowed his head and said si senor. I was not happy but since the hotels were only a couple of hundred yards apart and I had researched all the hotels in the zone before hand I knew I was getting similar accommodations. I was not going to take a stand at that point. If anything disappointed me at the VWA I would quickly return to the RC and have it out with them. A plus to this was that we were permitted to use all of the facilities and restaurants at both resorts - it tuned out to be a very nice arrangement. Our arrival at Viva Wyndham Azteca : The hotel lobby was modest an not air-conditioned. This would be a problem most of the time - but it is not that hot down there this time of year so it was not a big deal. If you want to hang out in the lobby and have a drink the Reef Club offered a better lobby. It had AC and a nice bar and TV. We went to our room which again was modest. The clothing shelves smelled a little moldy - there was no dresser for clothing !!? The room did have a mini frig that was stocked with : water bottles (2) soda cans (2) beer cans (2) OJ bottles (2) The frig is re-stocked everyday complimentary. This you will find as a big plus since I have read the RC and many others in this price range charge you $5 a pop for each and every item you take. The beds were fairly comfortable and the AC worked fine. The room was what I expected at this price level. The pool and grounds were very nice !! The beach was great but the gigantic sand bags (although puposeful and necessary) ruin the view of one of the nicest beaches in the entire carribean and gulf waters. However, they created a lagoon effect which made the somewhat calm waters ever more so. It was great for swimming and snorkeling (although there was very littlle to see if you did snorkel). We walked from the RC all the way down to the Viva Wyndham Maya (about a seven hotel stretch) and each hotel had the sanbags and no significant beach area. The beach was the same if you were at one of the RIU's or the RC or VWA so don't go to a more expensive hotel in this zone for the beach. The buffet at the VWA was decent - at least as good as the RC if not better (we ate at both). We also ate at the Bamboo (VWA) which was good for me but not so good for my girlfriend - she got a very bad cut of salmon filet. My recommendation there is to stay away from the fish and sit at the hibachi table and have the cook prepare the meal in front of you. We also ate at the Miramare (Italian) restaurant which was excellent !! This was at the Viva Wyndham Maya - this was a plus for staying at the VWA. Since it was another Wyndham and it was close by we were permitted to eat there !! Another perk at the VWA was free use of bicycles - and they had plenty of them. No bikes at the RC. The walk to 5th Avenue was a bit long (at least 20-25 mins) so we took the bikes into town during the day. You can take a walk down in the evening but get a taxi back - it is only $5. They had one tennis court at both the VWA and the RC but both were rooftop and offered quality that only teenagers goofing around and little kids and their mom's playing patty-cake could enjoy. If you had half decent tennis skills you would not want to use the courts. All in all I very very happy with my stay at the Viva Wyndham Azteca. I would go there again and again for the money I paid. One more tip for anyone staying in Playa Del Carmen - there is a bus terminal right on 5th Ave. We got tix to the airport for $8 per person. Get your tickets the day before you leave. The bus ride is about an hour and ten mins. We took a taxi down (from airport to PDC) and paid $90 (for two) and it only saved us ten or fifteen mins. My recommendation is to take a shuttle down to PDC from the arport at $60 (per couple) and take the bus back. Your total cost will be $76. This beats the $100 - $120 that the travel agency will charge you for shuttle fees back and forth to PDC from the airport.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bromley", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel, recommended\u201d", "Author": "Fatlady48", "ReviewID": "UR21051886", "Content": "Immaculately clean hotel.

We wanted to go somewhere nice to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We've been to Cancun before and had so much fun, but wanted to try Playa Del Carmen this time as we had heard that it was beautiful. Playa Del Carment was beautiful but our stay at this hotel was terrible. As others who traveled during this same time, our AC did not work for 3 of the days that we were there and this was so frustrating as how can anyone sleep in a hot room. I informed the front desk several times until they finally sent someone to look at it and the guy said he had fixed it and that we should give it an hour so that the room can get cool. Nothing happened! The room was still hot. The next day I complained again and they then agreed to show me another room but told me that the problem with the AC was with the whole hotel and that all the rooms would be hot. How can this be possible? I went and saw another room and it was even worse than the first one so we decided to just stay where we were at and suffer. I mean we weren't in the room that much because we kept ourselves busy doing tours or hanging out at the beach, but you at least want to be able to sleep comfortably and that was not the case. Go figure, they finally got the AC to work the last day we were there! Aside from the AC not working, our room was filled with little ants which at first I was like okay, this is not that bad but it did get annoying after a while. And the room smelled terrible, sort of like a moldy smell, and I don't know if that was just because it was just so humid and the AC wasn't working. The food is okay, nothing spectacular, what you would expect from a buffet. We didn't have trouble booking reservations for the sit down restaurants but those were also just okay, nothing to brag about. The service was very slow though, so be prepared to be there for a while. I do have to say that the animation staff was great! Those people work so hard and are always doing their best to make sure to enjoy yourself. They were the only positive thing about the hotel. Overall, just an okay place to stay at if you are on a tight budget. Next time I would pay the extra money and stay at a nicer place. Definetely would not stay here again.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cHonest review, stay elsewhere!\u201d", "Author": "campo84748", "ReviewID": "UR20578957", "Content": "Ok so i love Mexico. Been there over 100 times between the cruises and over many years. Thinking about sneaking across the border to live there one day until they kick me out. Reverse immigration..But i tell you what i do not love and that is the Wyndham azteca or the sister hotel the maya. This was sold to me as a 4 star hotel package. Honestly i was expecting maybe 3 1/2 stars. What i got was maybe 2 stars. Really i dont know where to start. Only had 4 nights to fly from NYC to Mx and was with my husband and 12 year old son. They had no expectations at all since they had only been on cruises to mexico and not over night in Mexico ever so i thought this would be a nice change for them. I booked this hotel because i reasoned after reading everything here on Trip Advisor that we were \"Only going to sleep in the room,not live there\". Boy was i wrong because it rained 4 days straight. Oct-Dec is heavy rainy season in that region. We were here the last week in Sept 2008. CHECK IN: I used Wyndhams USA tours for the ride in. They made us wait for an hour for other passengers and a mini van that never did arrive. So much for paying extra for the early flight! An hour later they agreed to get some guy they knew to take us to the hotel. Allright, no harm there. We get to the hotel, lobby seemed nice. Did notice people smoking everywhere right away..Not much of a welcome, just kinda asked for my paper with the RSVP numbers. Print that out and bring it with you or else. Room wasnt quite ready so we went to the buffet for some lunch. Wasnt very good, but i thought it must get better. THE ROOM: Hmm.. Im not quite sure how to say this but i guess the word is \"uncomfortable\". No AC, no dresser, dark, dingy, moldy but all cheerfully colored in late 1980's colors. AC was out for 2 of the 4 days (central to the buildings) . Noise can be heard from the chanting by the poolside by cheerful early morning europeans engagaing in what appeared to be water areobics. Beds were so hard that even my son complained. Gotta get to my chiro asap now...Yeow! Bathroom ammenities none. Nothing. Zilch, zippo. Towels seemed to be a problem since each day they left only 3. For 3 people. Tried to hide one but they took it away. Pool towels you get down by the pool with a card system. At this point after 2 hours i wanted to check out. But we were beat tired so after a short nap we strolled over to the sister resort down the road to see if that was a little better perhaps. Housekeeping comes in around 4ish and they seemed to be efficient and kind. Leave them a few bucks everyday, they work so hard. I feel badly for them. THE SHOWS: Yikes! Its off season and everyone of the staff is on vacation. Imagine the lion king performed with 2 people in it? Or a lip synching show were the performers did not know at least the basic lyrics and had to keep turning their heads away from the audience? Do you really want to come all the way here to see corny shows or do you want to go expereince the real Mexico anyway? So we got in a cab most nights and strolled around beautiful downtown Playa Del Carmen. Wow. Better to stay there but the food and drinks are too pricey...however they are GOOD!! If not great. We even ate near the bus terminal late at night for 1$ the best tacos of your life by the local street vendors. Its European prices everywhere else here, expect to pay big for everything. THE DRINKS: Terrible. They had 95% of the liquer brands that sell for 2$ a bottle and i think they were watering those down too. One bottle of Sky Vodka, and one of bacardi rum that i asked for a shot of and smelled it...i swear to you it was rubbing alcohol or something. The lobby bar did have a bottle of Jose Cuervo on hand at times but the drink mixes were funny tasting. Stay with coke or juice mixed drinks, or martinis. Some of the juices were ok but they were all out of a box. The service was fine though. My kid went up to the pool bar several times to get a pina colada from the bartender and they served it to him with liquer in it. He didnt tell me this till later on. No wonder he slept good after that. We had most of our drinks in town at 9-10$ a pop but what a difference in taste and quality! THE POOL & HOT TUB: My kid loved the pool . I choose this resort as not to have a huge place where i would not find my child. The hot tub was cold all the time at around 80 degress or so. Closes at 8 pm and its only about maybe 5 feet deep at its deepest point. As far as pools go it was nice. Walk up to the bar and snackbar nearby. The maya did have a swim up bar with stools in the water. THE BEACH: The way they have the sandwhales laid out you cannot really walk or swim around them without a certain degree of dificulty. They are slippery and you can get hurt. Signs tell you not to go on them. Listen to the signs. It makes a sort of safe pool there that goes about 7 feet deep but fish cannot get in there as they have a net further out to prevent larger fish from getting in and you from getting out. All the beaches there but for downtown have these hideous whales there. Looked like huge turds in the sand, but its either that or the erosion. Its still very pretty but dont plan on walking too far. Ample beach chairs, palapas, sports, jet skis nearby leaving a nice odor of diesel fuel for you to breath in. A few topless europeans here and there. Probably the nicest part of this resort, mind you the beaches downtown are nice too. THE FOOD: I wanted to like this resort. Im not picky! Really! Let me tell you about the food here. We mostly ate at the buffet because of our son, he wanted to eat and run so we did. We had reservations at the chinese and the Italian but we live in New york city. How much Italian and chinese food can one person eat in a lifetime? Yes we wanted real Mexican food!! You will not find it here at all. Whole sections of the buffet and trays dedicated to sliced cucumbers or tomatoes . Meat so tough that you cannot chew it. Unknown fish that no one knew the name of everynight. Edible only was the pork chops & chips salsa & guacamole. There was much space dedicated to peeled fruits & raw veggies which anyone who goes to MX knows you must not eat pre-peeled fruit dare you risk food poisoning! Desserts were good, one night they actually had real flan! The snack bar was worse yet,. No chips & salsa there. Burgers made from some kind of meat cooked rare only, burnt cheeseless pizza, hotdogs & some kind of a bolgna sandwich they were calling a \"club sandwich\" all putrid. Room service is quick but again, nothing is edible. I actually lost 5 lbs in 4 days. No coffee around either but for some very strong and bitter expressos & cappucinos. One night they had sushi. Oh yeah ..thats what ive traveled 6 hours for!!! The sushi!! They do have a pasta station and i suggest highly you stick to that. If you get really desperate you can stroll over to the Maya and they at least have a real wood burning oven there and make real pizza almost 24 hours a day, hey now thats a compliment by NY standards! As for the rest of the food at the maya, the one place we did want to eat..the Don Deigo was closed for whatever reason for the week. The food at the Mexican place at the Azteca, people were walking out after the 1st course to eat at the buffet..so that confirmed what everyone here said already. Here is the really sad part about this trip. We boarded the flight home with the same people we met on the way into Mexico. VERY PICKY people from NJ. They started to complain before we even took off! However on the way home they had GLOWING reviews for a place called the paridisus resort cancun maya. Each of them had an amazing story to tell about the food, service, room and beach. Mind you im sure its 2X or 3X the price as this place. But you get what you pay for. Not that it was cheap here by any means. My kid lived on the gelato with sprinkles all week. Never made it to breakfast though my husband said they had a good egg/ omlette bar and after the 1st lunch there i did not have the stomach for anymore of it. Only the buffet is open for lunch by the way. No other choice. THE GROUNDS: Very pretty! Nothing out of the ordinary though to report to you. One thing i must warn to all though.*********the tiles EVERYWHERE including all around the pool are very very very slippery when they get wet. People were falling all over the place including all of us. Ive got the black and blues to prove it. Lucky i did not break anything. Even the pavement is slippery when it is wet. Its just insane that anyone could even walk like this**********. I did note the lack of animals and wildlife on the property. Its like the set traps for them or something to keep them out on purpose. Just some crows and we did see several large rats. No they were not the local rabbit/mole creatures you see around. These were rats. At both resorts we took note of them. Across the street one night while walking we did see a monkey and one day on the road some iguanas. As i said it did rain alot so we didnt get to do that much. We counted on the hotel and we were let down. The Maya is more of the same only bigger. If i had to choose between the 2 hotels i would choose the Maya because there is more to do there such as archery and a trampoline. Beach looked the same to me. Its only a few resorts down the road. Can walk the beach there as well . STAFF: All wonderful, cant say enough nice things about all of you guys there! If i came back it would be because of you and you only. THIS & THAT: I think this hotel chain was recently bought out by another but im not sure of this. Dont be fooled into the morning phone call to come get your welcome gift at VIP services! Im always wise to this one. Just say ok thanks, and never go unless you want to waste your time on the time share losers. I wouldnt go back to this resort if it were free. No thank you. My guess is that the Europeans like this a whole lot more then us americans for some reason. They fly 10 hours to get there if you can imagine that. And they have 2 or more months a year off from work and the money to do so.( Can you detect a hint of jealousy there?? ?) However, you and I do not. Not with the way our economy is going. You know this, and that my friend is why I am writing this. Not to badmouth a resort..the people were very nice, no problems with anyone there. Its the food and the room. You can do better somewhere else. Smaller is not better in this case. I wanted to like it, but it was just terrible. Like i said at the start, ive been to Mexico many many times. Playa Del Carmen since there wasnt anything but a beach a bar and 1000 hammocks. This isnt 4 star. Its 2 1/2 star. Take a peak next door at the hideaway or the Iberostar. Those are 4 and 5 star resorts done right. If it had been sold to me as a 2 or even 3 star there would be no problem in my understanding , but 4 stars? Please take that down or you will have many many unhappy people. . Overall i rate this hotel a good place to stay if you can sleep on a rock and like to eat slop. Dont say i didnt try warn you! There really are so many wonderful place to stay around this area, you need to do your homework and think carefully about your choice because you will have to live with that for your vacation. Most people there were between 25-55. Didnt see another american there, but thats not the problem. The problem was the food and the room. Both not anywhere near what they should be for 4 stars. I really wish i had something positive to say about the Viva Azteca and Maya. Even developed a bad cough and congestion due to mold in the room and all the moisture from the rain with the ac not working most of the time. Let me try to leave on a postive note anyway...let me think. The TV worked very good, was able to watch the fox news chanel and CNN world news. Thats about it. If you want a solid 3.5 star hotel try Sandos playacar down the road for a much better value.", "Date": "October 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery Average at Best\u201d", "Author": "DallasFireFighter", "ReviewID": "UR20501803", "Content": "Went to the Azteca for a quick, extended, birthday, weekend vacation.

A couple of weeks before we were due to travel we received a letter from the travel agent stating that due to adverse weather the beach had been significantly reduced. Obviously we panicked. We looked into the situation and decided to keep the Azteca instead of changing. On arrival we were greeted with posh glass of non-alcoholic fruity drink and breezed through check-in and whisked off to our room. Our bags were brought up by a member of staff. When we entered our room we were greeted by a bottle of bubbly in a bucket with ice and some fancy meat and cheese. We also had a plate of fruit and matching Viva Wyndham t-shirts. On the ridiculously huge bed they had shaped 2 towels into swans and their necks made a heart shape. This was all a fantastic welcome for us newlyweds. After settling in we went to view the \"significantly reduced beach\". We couldn't see a problem. There were sandbags in the sea but this did not affect any aspect of the beach only giving swimmers a nice place to sit on once swimming out to it. As with most all-inclusive hotels we were given wristbands that would enable us to use all facilities at this hotel and the Maya that was only a few hundred feet down the road. The food was plentiful and of a high standard. The breakfast buffet had foods from all around the world and could cater for the fussiest of eaters. I was spoilt for choice on most days. The lunchtime buffet was again a very huge selection of food from all around the world. I could have eaten steak every day if I wanted. The evening buffets were varied. Every night had a different country theme. I particularly enjoyed the Mexican theme because they put out traditional Mexican dishes. You would know you were in Mexican then. A few nights whilst we were there they set up stalls in the main square where local traders would sell their goods. They would sell the usual Mexican hats along with more classy Mexican silver. The square had a fountain in the middle which made it feel like you were actually in Mexico and not just some random fancy hotel. The hotel offered 3 restaurants that you had to book (and wear trousers). There was an Italian, a Mexican and an Oriental restaurant. I'm not very keen on Oriental food but the wife loves it and she says it was fantastic food. I picked at it because i'm quite fussy with food. The restaurants are all decorated to fit in completely with the themes. The Italian was lovely and I actually felt like we were in an upper class restaurant in there. The Mexican restaurant was my favourite. It is outside on a wooden balcony next to a water feature and had Mexican artifacts scattered around. This was brilliant. We went back to this one on our last night. The only thing I will say is that because it is outside you will need to use mosquito repellent. As I have mentioned earlier you can use the facilities of the sister hotel, the Maya. We visited their Mexican restaurant and their Mediterranean restaurant. The Mediterranean restaurant had the most pleasant staff I have ever known but the menu was mainly fish. I'm fussy so didn't really enjoy that but thought i'd give it a go. Again, the wife loved it. This restaurant overlooks the sea and is really romantic. The food at the Mexican at the Maya wasn't very nice. I had a huge lump of gristle in my chicken. However, this restaurant was more the sort of Mexican food that you would expect at home. The Azteca has a regular bar, Bar Mexicali, and the pool bar. Both serve the same drinks. The pool bar is open 24 hours and also offers food. I could never walk passed without getting a hotdog. The cocktails were fantastic. It is surprising that you can get alcohol 24 hours a day 7 days a week and we didn't see one single drunk person. The entertainment on offer was amazing. They have a team of people from all over the world and they put on everything from Aqua-Aerobics to the main show at the end of the night. They are hard workings people and they were always smiling. The shows they put on at the end of the night were brilliant. Our first night was a Mexican show where they dressed up in convincing traditional Maya dress and danced around with fire. They also did the Lion King and Grease to name just a couple. The hotel offers a Kids Club and the guy running that looked like he genuinely loves his job. It is great to see the kids hanging on his every word and instruction. The rapour was fantastic. The hotel has many loungers to use but it was annoying when people claim them with their towels and then you don't see them all day. The activities on offer for free was a trial dive in the swimming pool, kayaking, table tennis, tennis, gym, catamaran, volleyball (both pool and beach), plus many many more. We wanted to do a few day trips but didn't want to pay the hyper-inflated prices charged by Thomas Cook so we sought about doing them ourselves. The reception staff were so helpful in directing us to the bus station (ADO). We saved loads of money doing this by walking to the bus station (30 minutes away). There is a Bureau-De-Change onsite. Their rates aren't bad but we changed money in the bank in town for the best rates. When we were due to leave we asked if they had a weighing scales for us to weigh our bags because the airport is really strict with excess baggage charging. They pointed us to the Gym and the guy there was incredibly helpful and weighed our bags for us. In summary this hotel was easily the best I have ever stayed in. It is a very simple hotel but that gives it a more traditional Mexican feel. The staff were some of the nicest and helpful people I have had the pleasure of meeting. The entertainment was plentiful and of a high standard.

It was wonderful! After deciding on a destination wedding in the Riviera Maya area, we did an exhaustive search to find a hotel that was a good value for our guests, located within easy distance of Playa Del Carmen (some resorts are relatively isolated), not too big (so we could find each other), not too formal (we're a casual bunch), and a good wedding location. The Azteca came up on top and it exceeded our expectations. First, we cannot thank our wedding coordinator, Marco Castillo, enough. From the time we first contacted the hotel, he responded promptly and courteously, and he took wonderful care of our guests, making sure they received the gift beach bags and goodies we brought as wedding favors, personally supervising the men who dug in the sand to set up our wedding arch and arrange chairs, carpet, tulle, and flowers, advising us on our group excursion to Tulum (which we did by bus in Playa del Carmen) and meeting with us almost every day to make sure we had all of our paperwork, music, etc. in order. The biggest surprise came after my husband asked Marco if the hotel had eggs benedict for our honeymoon morning breakfast. It wasn't, and he said something else was fine, but Marco surprised him by researching the recipe, giving it to the chef, and sending him eggs benedict (or close to it!). The Azteca is a great little hotel. It's very clean and well maintained and the staff are extremely hardworking and friendly. The activities staff were a blast. We participated in dance contests, beer drinking contests, Spanish lessons, etc. in the bar, theater and pool area. The Azteca was small enough for us to find our guests anywhere. The food was very good. We were able to try all the restaurants, but our favorite was Il Palco, where we had our wedding receiption. (My husband, his sister and one of our guests are Italian-American and raved about the penne arribiata and the pork scallopine). (TIP: Make all of your restaurant reservations as soon as you get there and don't expect to get into an a la carte on your first night. This was also true of our much larger, more expensive honeymoon hotel). One of the best features of the hotel, though, is the beach, which is beautiful. My husband had stayed at a resort north of Playa del Carmen a few years ago, and the beach was rocky there. No rocks at the Azteca, which has been restored since the hurricaine and has some man-made barriers/sandbags to protect the beach. It was fun to swim out to one of the barriers and stand up on it in the ocean. Some of our guests went jetskiing and parasailing through the Azteca and had a great time. (Warning: beware of the timeshare guy from the Reef hotel/timeshare down the street who tries to lure you into a time share tour with free jetskiing.) As for booking your room, join Wyndham by Request and book through wyndham.com to get beverages/snacks in your room (all of our guests who joined got a bottle of wine in their rooms).

Their activities, mind you, consisted of seeing how far you can spit water from your mouth. I'm not kidding. They had pool activities, if you're into that sort of thing. The Nightly shows, were like sitting through a little childs school play. They were terrible, and not even in sink with the music. We often went to get a laugh. The food was terrible. They call it all inclusive, but you can only make 2 reservations at the restaurants for the entire week stay. We complained and got a 3rd. The buffet was just not enjoyable. Breakfast was decent, can't go wrong with an egg station. Dinner at the italian restuarant was good. The mexican was awful. Go figure. There are a lot of mosquitos, bring bug spray.

We are a family with 2 daughters aged 12 and 15, and we just absolutely loved this place. The hotel is smaller and less grand than a lot in the area, but by no means was this a fault. It had a really nice feel to it, the nicest, and most hard working staff we have ever meet. When we first arrived I must admit I found it a bit annoying when they kept asking us to join in their games, (but i was very tired after a long flight). But the animation team do a fabulous job of keeping everyone entertained. They work all day long doing this, then do a show at night also! We only went to a few shows, and they were quite good, and always funny. (Except we I had to participate one night!) We found the food at the buffet very good, always a great variety for all our fussy family. Never went hungry or Thirsty for that matter. Enjoyed trying different cocktails, We tried all 3 restaurants, they were fine, nothing special but nothing to complain about either. Rooms were basis, and yes the bed a little bit hard! But we slept fine, this was not a problem. The maids cleaned the rooms everyday, and the whole place was spotlessly clean. These guys are so efficient without being 'in your face'. The pool area and beach area,.....well I just fell in love with the beach (and I really am not a beach person!) The pool was really well kept,and my 12 year loved it. Plenty of activities going on here, including Tequilla Volleyball! - geat fun! We never had a problem getting a sunlounger on the beach. The water was beautiful, and the sand bags did not take away from this beach at all, infact they were very good fun. But I can see why guests from nearby hotels may complain, as it is a problem for them, but not the Azteca. The beach was cleaned ever morning, I just did not want to leave the place, and I can't stress enough gratitude to all the staff at the Azteca for making this one of the best holidays we have ever had. One other review stated that this was a 3 star resort with 5 star staff - I completely agree.

I can say this was more of an adventure than a vacation since I was in the midst of wedding planning myself, so didnt have much time to party, but all my guests did so thats all that mattered to me-that they had a good time. We had 60 guests there for our wedding, so was very busy and big event for us! So here are my reviews: PROS: 1) One of the best beaches in the areas, considering the hurricane a while back, many of the hotels around didn't have as nice of beach.. the Azteca & Maya were winners here, hands down. 2) Rooms can get extra cold with A/C which is needed when you are staying here in summer months like we were... 89% humidity..was suffocating!! 3) Many activites for guests to do, re: snorkeling, jet ski's excursions, etc.. just stay away from annoying time share people 4) location is great, as its 5 minutes away from 5th Ave and rest of tourist areas and in very safe community. 5) Wedding ceremony itself was very nice and glady, the weather cooperated with us.. we had our wedding directly on the beach so it was windy and nice, not too hot as usually was elsewhere..6) The Restaurants had really good food and selection for most part - didnt care for the buffet though.. CONS: 1) For anyone who is considering having a wedding here, here are some things you need to be aware of:.. a) dont do it in the summer months.. first- because its entirely too hot.. your fall and winter months are soo much better b) If your very picky about all details and anal about organization of your functions, this may not be the best place for you.. eventhough everything mostly went ok, there were still some snags that I dont think we should of had to deal with from the wedding coordinater -Marco Castillo. For one, maybe because July is such a hot month there, but when they say they have A/C in the restaurants, thats what we expected, but we barely got any and had to confront Marco numerous time to make sure the A/C was even on or set right!! DONT EXPECT REAL A/C IN THE RESTAURANTS! We had 3 wedding dinners re: welcome dinner, etc etc and it was HOT in the restaurants !!!!.. i found this VERY unacceptable considering they are suppose to have a/c in there, and their units must be very old . This was our main downfall and issue during this trip at this hotel. A/C was barely on at Portofino, yet felt OK at Bamboo for rehearsal dinner. However we made it VERY CLEAR that it had to be on and cool for wedding reception at IL Paco. IT WASNT! Needless to say we were extremely upset to see that us and our guests had to be uncomfortable and hot at our own wedding reception!! We let Marco know our disapproval w/ this and they kept saying it was on, but it was entirely too hot still, and they brought in fans and tried to cool it down more.. i feel a large running hotel like this, truly needs some upgrades here.. it makes no sense to have simple A/C problems like this in a hotel with so many guests. Luckily we were still able to have a good time and make best of it, but i truly feel this tainted my wedding reception and still very upset about it. I feel Marco wasnt doing enough to make sure we were happy and was just too non-chalant in fixing some of the requests or issues we had. He also was not very organized all the time, and we ended up having to overlook mostly everything with him to make sure he was doing what we requested correctly. I feel I shouldn't have had to do that since he is the wedding coordinator and is suppose to take more pro-active role in making sure his clients were taken care of more. I rate Marco (wedding coordinator) a 3 on a scale from 1-10. Attn to all Brides: Beware of this!! Overall, the wedding decor and other details were very nice and were set up as we requested (outside of the videographer, that is). Overall, we had a good wedding, but the A/C thing was a huge issue for me! Also, another annoying thing was beware of all the beach onlookers when having your wedding on the beach! Yes, they do block off a certain area of beach for your ceremony and only your guests, but we still got a wall of people trying to look at our ceremony, take pictures, etc. Some of them were just really annoying!! I expected a few lookers, but we had almost the whole beach viewing like it was a show!!! Most of them respect the boundaries they cant cross and stay within their parameters set , but you still get some trying to sneak a picture, etc. This may not be a big deal for some, and it wasnt that terrible, was just annoying I felt. Another improvement for Marco: MAKE SURE YOU KEEP A STRICT BOUNDARY ON BEACH ON-LOOKERS FOR BEACH CEREMONIES! Overall, this is definately a 3-star hotel...if you want luxury and a little more class, do not stay here, spend money for a 4 or 5 star!!!", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "scotland", "Title": "\u201cAs advertised in brochure- excellent holiday resort\u201d", "Author": "GradyScotland", "ReviewID": "UR18315634", "Content": "Overall fab holiday. very good value for money. staff excellent and really want you to enjoy their country.

I cannot say enough good things about the staff at this resort. The complaints I read on Trip Advisor were primarily true, the food was not spectacular (but better than other reviews said), the rooms were not great but good for the price, the beaches have sandbags, and the staff is phenomenal. With that in mind our group had a fabulous time, and everyone wants to return again soon! We booked our airport transfers through the hotel with Sabrina's help. Once we existed the airport we immediately saw a man standing there with a sign with the name of our resort. Our buses stopped to get us beer and headed to the resort. Excellent service. Luis was our driver (for one van) going to the resort and we had a blast with him. The fee for the transfers was billed to our room. Going back to the airport we were put into two vans with people from the Maya. It was a bit cramped with 10 adults in the van, but we were spoiled on the way to the resort with two vans for just our group. When we arrived some of our rooms were ready, some were not, we arrived early in the day. The staff took care to accommodate us and hold our luggage until the rest of the rooms were available. Upon arrival we were offered pina coladas while checking in. There were a few problems with the rooms, the only problem we had the entire time we were at the resort. Two of the eight rooms were unacceptable. One was a mix-up between what they requested, and what they were given. The other was an unacceptable balcony. Both were quickly remedy, one fixed that day, the other at noon on our second day. We were given a very nice room, room 1100, with a Jacuzzi, closest to the beach, and a nice patio overlooking the beach and pool. The room was beautiful. The only complaint is that the door frame was falling down. Several times my husband opened the door and the entire door frame fell to the floor. A bit concerning to sleep at night knowing someone could easily break in. I heard from others in our group that the door frames in their rooms looked brand new, so I assume they are in the process of replacing them. The shower did leak out into the bathroom (as I read on Trip Advisor). The Jacuzzi filled with sand every time we used it. Even when we were not sandy prior to getting in it. Our only guess is that it was sediment from the water. We had bath products from Bath & Body Works in our room. Room 1101 was also very nice with a good view, and extra small kitchenette area. Room 1103 had a nice patio as well. I did not see 1201, but heard it was nice. We all got a note in our room asking us to come to the VIP area for a \"free gift\". When we tried to redeem our free gift we realized it must be some sort of timeshare sale from the VIP office and quickly left. Most of us joined Wyndham By Request prior to going. We ate lunch in the buffet everyday and everyone found something they liked. The pico and guacamole were both wonderful. Prior to arriving I emailed Rodolfo to request restaurant reservations. He guaranteed us a reservation at Xul-Ha for our first night there at two different times due to the size of our group. When we checked in and I asked him about our reservation, he not only had that set up for us, but also made a reservation for the entire group at the Italian restaurant for the next night. We greatly appreciated the second reservation since we understood we were only going to get one since we were staying less than seven nights. Both restaurants were good. Xul-Ha was better than the Italian. The grouper and peanut butter ice cream at Xul-Ha were very good. Late night we ate at the pool bar. Takes a lot of alcohol to be able to eat the food at the pool bar, gross. Breakfast was very good as well. Wide selection. It was the same everyday, but there is so much to choose from you cannot get bored. Omelets one day, french toast the next, cereal, yogurt, eggs, lots of options, and all good. We went into town to Carboncitos for dinner one night. The owner / manager (?) is from NYC. We all really enjoyed our meals. I highly suggest trying this place. We asked for a dinner suggestion at guest services at the Azteca. They sent us to Casa Agua on 5th. When we saw the prices, we quickly changed our mind and went somewhere more affordable and highly suggested (Carboncitos). The pool is clean and always has something going on. We spent most of our time at the beach, but the pool was nice. There are sandbags that are not so pretty in the water, but we found them convenient and nice to have. We all enjoyed sitting on the sandbags, with the waves washing over us when it got to hot. Plus the challenge of climbing up the side of a sandbag in the waves provided endless fun. We never had a problem finding chairs at the beach, and we were a very large group. Every time we went to the beach (usually after lunch) we were able to find plenty of chairs that we could pull together in the sun and shade so everyone could sit and enjoy the beach. The staff is amazing!!!! I cannot say enough nice things about the staff! Rodolfo helped us organize everything at the hotel for our group. He was helpful to everyone and went out of his way to assist us. Sabrina helped us organize our transportation. Wendy helped us with our rooms. Sara, part of the activities staff, went out of her way to make sure everyone was having fun. David took us on a wonderful catamaran tour (multiple times), along with a man from Croatia whose name I do not remember now. Olver and Manuel were wonderful at the bars. And there are a few other people whose names I wish I knew so I could complement them directly. The staff is what makes this resort amazing. They are there to help, always nice, energetic, accommodating, wonderful, and are an example for resorts everywhere. The drinks are good. They have decent liquors, you just have to ask for them. They did not skimp on the alcohol in the drinks. I tried most of the drink menu and can say the mojito and tequila sunrise are the best. The entire group really liked the mojitos. Olver at the front bar was wonderful. The bartender in the sports bar, Gonzalo I think, treated everyone to a fun night teaching us how to make drinks. We spent time in the evenings in the sports bar playing foosball, pool, and checkers. Manuel at the pool bar put up with us for five days with a smile every time. We took out the kayaks and catamarans several times. The activities staff drives the catamaran if you want them to go with you. This is included in the price (although we did tip because it was so beautiful). The catamarans are wonderful, and a must see / do part of the resort. We walked down to the Maya twice. It is nice, with a swim up bar, but not any nicer than the Azteca. The shopping plaza across from the Maya in Playcar is nice too. We all went into town at some point. The bikes or a cab are the best way to go. The walk is not bad, but it is hot and 5th Avenue is long so you will be walking for hours if you walk all the way down 5th and back. 10 people in our group went on an Edventures tour booked before we went. I did not go so I cannot say much, but I heard fabulous reviews from everyone that went. Others in our group went golfing at Playacar Golf Course and seemed to enjoy it, but it was a bit pricey. We checked out several other resorts in the area as we plan to return in the near future. After looking at the other resorts, their beaches, and knowing the prices we will return to the Azteca (mainly due to the staff!). Overall, this is a 3 star resort with a 5 star staff. That makes it 4 stars. We all agree for the price we will come back sometime soon. The beach is as good, if not better, than others in the area. The grounds of the resort are beautiful. The rooms are adequate to good. The staff is phenomenal. The food is decent to good (for an all inclusive and Mexico). I highly suggest this resort!

We actually booked our stay at the Viva Wyndham Maya, but they moved us to the Azteca because they had somehow overbooked the Maya. The resort grounds really were very clean. There was no trash anywhere. Even with drunk and annoying people flinging food all around the buffet area, the staff kept everything picked up and spotless. Our room (standard hotel room, we requested 1 king bed but got 2 queens for some reason) was fine, bathroom and vanity area large, the safe worked fine. The buffet was typical buffet food- there were always chicken, fish and beef options, as well as a variety of rice and vegetable dishes. I'm not sure why people complain so much about the quality of the buffet food- we only paid $900 for 6 nights of all inclusive food and alcohol, and you get what you pay for. We certainly never went hungry. The \"24-snack bar,\" which is the bar and snack station by the pool, is a little misleading. The bar is open all the time, but the burgers and pizza and stuff are actually put out in shifts. For example, food is out for a couple of hours after lunch, but then there's no more food out until 11:00 p.m. We only tried one of the restaurants, the Italian one. That was actually a fun change of pace- ordered the chicken parm, was more food than I could eat. Waitstaff does an excellent job. The alcohol is truly all-inclusive. There are basically 2 bars on the property- the one to the side of the lobby, which is set up with low club chairs and tables, and the one by the pool bar. The bartenders are very friendly, kept the beer flowing, and make a mean daquiri. The beach front is gorgeous- yes, there are sandbags in the water, but it's certainly not the resort's fault that the beach front in all of Playa del Carmen is eroding. The water is clean and the most wonderful shade of blue I've ever seen! Lifegaurds are on duty all day, and the staff comes around on the beach all day long trying to get you to join the activities and classes. Can be a little annoying if you don't want to participate and have to tell them \"No\" 42 times, but many people seemed to enjoy it. People were taking out the kayaks and catamarans all day, and the staff seemed to do a good job of showing novices how to use them. All in all, we had a good time. We're both full time students with a budget, and we really didn't have to spend any money once we showed up. One thing to mention- maybe this is standard at beach front resorts, I don't know because this is the first one in Mexico I've been to, but the entire resort is open air. Neither the bars nor the main buffet is enclosed, so there's no air conditioning anywhere except for the rooms and the gift shop. Not a big deal, just thought I'd mention it. It's not the most romantic place in the world, and there's not that much for kids to do or for a young couple to do, so we just relaxed and drank all week, I think that if you went with a group of people, this would be a great place to go, but if you're looking for a romatic week or you want your kids to have a bunch of kid friendly things to do, I would probably look elsewhere.", "Date": "June 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cWyndham Non-receptive to customers\u201d", "Author": "valcom2", "ReviewID": "UR16991384", "Content": "My wife, myself and our two children (14 yearold twins) stayed at the Wyndham Azteca from May 27 to June 3. We had booked the Maya because of the childrens activities and the reviews stating the beach was in better shape. When we arrived at the Maya, we were told there was no room for us and we were being \"upgraded\" to the Azteca. Later I met 3 other couples who were also \"upgraded\" from the Maya. Our experience was colored by this upgrade in that our tour bus company (Olympic) could not locate us until the last day. Amazingly, even though we called them several times and set up appointments, their reps NEVER managed to show up at the hotel. I ended up negotiating all of our excursions through an individual at a time-share booth in the Playacar market. The buffet food was decent enough, especially breakfast, and we loved the Oriental restaurant at the Azteca. Because of the activities we were originally interested in (archery, wall climbing) for the children, we split our time between the Maya and the Azteca, but wish our original booking had been honored. Two days after we arrived, they closed the pool at the Azteca, ripping it up with jackhammers, and re-opening it only the day before our departure. Wyndham has been completely uncaring that this eliminated the last of the amenities we wanted available for our trip and continually insisted we had been \"upgraded\". NO pool, no archery, no rockwall, a definite DOWNGRADE in beach facilities but this was an \"upgrade\"???

I'm happy to report that we weren't disappointed! We had a great time, the food was great, lots of variety in the buffet, rooms were exceptionally clean, bar fridge always stocked, no bugs! This is definitely not a luxury resort, however, so look elsewhere if that's what you're looking for. The a la carte restaurants were okay, not great. We much preferred the buffet.

Because this was our first experience with an all-inclusive, we were not sure what to expect. Everything from the plentiful food and drinks to the clean inviting beach and pool were great! Our 1st floor room overlooking the pool had a beautiful view and was very spacious and clean. The decor is simple and colorful, with travertine on the floors as well as the bathroom counter and walls, which we liked a lot. THe beds are indeed very hard as other reviewers mentioned, but tolerable. The truth is that we were so relaxed anyway, that some nights we didn't even notice how hard the bed was. Of the 4 a la carte restauarants we tried, Bamboo was the best and Portofino the worst. If you are flexible with the dinner reservation time/date, then you will have a much easier time booking the restuarants of your choice. The major negative experience at the resort was our visit to the Viva Vacation Club office! Guests are lured in by getting a post card in your room, saying the front desk has a welcome gift for you...when you go to pick it up, they tell you to go to the welcome office where you are suckered into going to the Viva Club presentation where they subject guests to hours of hard sales tactics. After being in there for 4 hours, we finally gave in which was a big mistake! We signed up for a membership, then after giving it some thought realized we were pushed into something we did not want, and gave our written request to cancel, as allowed by the contract. What they do not tell you is that if you change your mind, you lose all \"closing costs\" which represents a large chunk of change. Over a month has gone by and we are having to retain a lawyer to get the Viva theives to comply with returning our money. Definitley not the vacation memories you want to have.

It couldn't have been a better resort to provide exactly the sort of fun and relaxation that was needed! Everything about our holiday here was perfect. The location was safe and beautiful. Not only was there the peace and quiet of the Playacar area - - but the fun and bustle of Playa del Carmen, only a 20 min. walk or 5 min. taxi ride away. The food was awesome, especially in the buffet. I wouldn't even bother with with specialty restaurants, which have limited choice and aren't particularly authentic (we tried the Italian, and the Asian, the better of the two). My daughter is a committed vegetarian, and it is always an issue as to whether there will be enough items to eat. Well, the buffet offered more than we could dream of! The selection of fresh fruit was particularly impressive, but there were many other options. The desserts were delicious too. Every morning I would have a cappuccino from the bar before breakfast, a lovely relaxing way to ease into the day. We always ate outside in the courtyard, which is not too hot providing that your umbrella puts your table in the shade. The entertainment staff were so friendly and upbeat. Where do they get the energy! We loved their shows, especially as we got to know them better. Although they are not really dancing professionals, they did a very good job, and you knew that they were \"real\" people, with many of their other skills evidenced throughout the day. Contrary to what some other people have said, we found the reception staff very friendly and helpful. Manuel, the door man, always got us a taxi within minutes, and the cleaning staff - - what can I say? You could eat off the floors at the Azteca. They sure put my housekeeping skills to shame! Okay, the beds are hard. The pillows were okay, however, and the rest of the room was just fine, and everything functioned exactly how it should. The view was lovely. If you want to go to Tulum, don't bother with a tour. You can get a collectivo in Playa which is cheap, air-conditioned and efficient. Just ask your taxi driver to drop you at the collectivo station. By the way, the taxis are the cleanest and cheapest of any place I have been to. If you walk into Playa, about halfway there, on the left, there is a bird sanctuary, which we loved. As it is filled with interesting trees and vines as well as birds, it is a good place to visit on a very hot day.

We got to know them the second day we got there. We thought we would go and watch the dance lesson that took place at the pool and instead ended up in the dance lesson. From that moment on we were more inclined to participate in everything they had to offer. From the water polo, tequila volleyball, the competitions and the evening shows. They encourage you to join in but do not push if you just want to relax. I would go back to this resort simply for the animation staff. The food in the buffet was good, but not great.

The resort is small and easy access to all the restaurants, pool and beach. No swim up bar, but the bar is very accessible. However, it would be nice if the bar was between the pool and the beach as you had a little bit of a hike from the beach for a beverage. If you wanted a chair at the pool you had to get up at 6:00am and put out your towel or you were out of luck. The activities at the pool were fun for both adults and kids. The beach, very disappointing. Big sandbags and for the first 10 feet going into the water you were stepping on sharp rocks. While we were there it was very windy and the water quite choppy and you could not see the bottom, which had debris from the sandbags and fairly large rocks.Not really what you would hope to find in the Carribean. Because of the erosion, people are pretty much on top of on another. If you have ever been to the DR, you know what a beautiful beach is, this one is not. The food was okay. They have three \"specialty restaurants\"- Italian,Japanese, and Mexican. You can only make one reservation in each per week. So for the rest of the time you are at the buffet, which frankly, was as good as the restaurants. Show were fun and colorful. The young adults working the resort are definately the high point of the resort. They are full of fun and get the crowd involved. The rooms are iffy. They do have some upgraded beach front which are lovely. We were originally put in smoking room which we specifically asked not to have. We were moved to another room which was as far away as you could get from the beach and pool but much cleaner. Would I go back, no. We go for the beaches and this beach has not recovered from the hurricanes and certainly do not do the lure of the Caribbean justice.We walked along the other resorts and they all have suffered the same fate.

So I decided I would call to make the reservations a month in advance. They first told me that they don't make reservations at all and we can only make them once we arrive (at which point, I figured they may be all booked). Their reason was that if they needed to book the restaurant out for a function, they don't want people to get upset at them for cancelling their reservation. So I made a deal with the guy (head of guest services named Rodolfo) and got him to give us reservations, under the condition that we understand they will be cancelled if there staurant needs to be rented for a function. Getting down there, I checked on our reservations, and met directly with the guy I had spoken to on the phone (Rodolfo)- he claimed that I never mentioned that I was only staying 4 nights, and that I could not have 3 reservations for the alacarte restaurants. I asked why does it matter how long I'm staying and argued with him alot. He claimed that if you stay one week, they will give you 3 reservations. I was livid and thought it was such [--]. Eventually he gave me the 3 reservations I asked for. I was thinking maybe the restaurants were so busy that they didn't have enough space for all the hotel guests. WHAT A SCAM!!! Because the first night we went to the mexican alacarte restaurant, IT WAS EMPTY!!!! The restaurant had a few tables throughout the few hours we were there. It was so rediculous that they makde such a big deal of giving us reservations and are keeping the restaurants empty because they don't want to pay. We checked out the other restauran5ts and it was the same thing. ALL EMPTY! We even tried to bring 2 of our friends one night to dine with us (we already had a reservation) and they ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT ACCOMODATE US! I literally was arguing with the guy- who was telling me to my face that there was no room in the restaurant- AS I WAS POINTING TO THE WHOLE EMPTY RESTAURANT and asking him how there possibly not be room!!! In addition- I will say that the FOOD WAS IN-EDIBLE! It was the most disgusting food I've ever had in my life. We literally could not consume it- we left the resort for lunch and dinner every single day after our first day. The buffet food was gross and the alacarte food was barely any better. The alacarte restaurants had like 3 choices for things to eat. God help you if you're vegetarian. The food was so horrible, we actually lost weight on our trip. Granted we are from NYC and a little spoiled by some of the greatest restaurants in the country- but this was NOT EVEN EDIBLE! In addition, the room was old, the closet door broken, the mirror with all little black spots where it peeled away on the back, THERE WAS NO bureau for our clothes. There was literally no place for us to put our stuff (besides hanging in the closet) so we had to keep it in our suitcases the whole time. There were no rugs on the tiled floors, not even a runner or spacerug so it was cold hard tiles every time we came into the room. The beach was very small and when you looked out- all you saw were the large sandbags they use to evade erosion. So not a beautiful site at all. Also booking transportation for our departure for the airport- they demaded we leave 4 hours prior in order to arrive there 3 hours before our plane leaves. This is insane as it only takes 45 minutes to get to the airport and then 1 hour in advance in PLENTY!

A la carte restaurants were good and also included w/no extra charges. Staff speak many languages. Drinks were goood, we always requested doubles. Many activites. You can take advantage of both Viva Resorts, Azteca and Maya. CONS: All pools and Jacuzzis at both Viva resorts close at 8PM, I thought that was silly. Jacuzzi heater didnt seem to work.

WiFi was only in the small business center, free for your laptop $2.50 per 35 mins for their PCs.

We did that but they needed a marriage license which we didn't have, there were no exceptions to that rule unfortunately. That was a bit of a bummer.

The checkins both ways were the fastest I've ever had with any airlines. Flights were delayed about 20 minutes both ways which to me is on time. They fed us chinese on the way down and a pizza on the way back. Movies both ways but most people were trying to sleep. Note. If you see a blanket as you are boarding, grab it because they run out. Check in: We got to the hotel around 8:30 am. Rooms weren't ready until about 2pm. Tried the $20 tip to get a room early but didn't work which I suppose is good. Reception was very friendly and helpfull. Rooms: Rooms were good. Getting a little bit old but clean. Small balcony, you could stand out there but not sit down, but good for hanging wet towels. Small fridge. We left a tip in the fridge every daya and the maid would fully stock it. Bars: Two bars, one lounge by the reception and another bar down by the pool. Both gave good service whether you tip or not. Food: The food at the buffet was very good. Line ups were not very big and the service was good. We went over to the Maya for a supper buffet one night and found it to have long line ups and pretty hectic compared to the azteca buffet. We went to two ala carte restruarants. The mexican at the azteca and the Italian at the Maya. Both were good. The snack food at the pool bar was good. We did wake up one morning where the bar was shut down for renovations. No big deal as they had made a temporary bar on the beach. Activities: Lots of different activities but the activity group were't too pushy if you didn't want to participate. Volleyball: The most important part of the vacation for me is the beach volleyball. This hotel had a pretty good set up. WIth the beach being eroded they had moved the court back up the beach against one of the buildings. It caused a few problems with balls going up on balconys and the roof but on the most part worked out pretty well. They had a couple of organized times a day for volleyball but otherwise they just left us the balls and organized our oown games. Played at the Maya one day but there court is behind one of their buildings. They've got a few inches of sand with a hard pan below so it could hurt a bit if you do much diving. One day there was nothing going on at our hotel so I walked down the beach and picked up a game at one of the other hotels not problem. Beach:. We had been in Playacar back in 2000 so the beaches are devastated by the hurricanes compared to what they were before. However the Azteca and Maya beaches are better then most of the beachs in the playacar area. All of the hotels have giant sand bags in front of their hotels trying to stop further erosion. Watch when you are walking on the sand bags and they get a bit slimy and seen a few people take some tumbles. They also all have pumps (quiet) running full time, pumping sand from from off shore onto the beach trying to build them up. Tours: We did one tour through edadventures(Bonnie and Eduardo). We used this small tour company after reading very positive reviews on trip adviser. Would highly recommend them. You tell what you want to see and they arrange it for you. We ended doing Coba (Mayan ruins), Dos Ajos (cenote/cave snorkling) and ocean snorkling (akumal Bay). We originally were going by ourselves (3) but Bonnie had contacted us asking if we minded joining up with another group that wanted to do part of our tour. Saved us $75 so no problem. Our tour gude (Carlos) picked us up at 7 am at our hotel in a air conditioned 12 passenger van. Carlos had worked for cp hotels up in canada so he spoke perfect english as was a very good guide through the area. Total cost for the 3 of us (not including entrance fee and bikes at coba) was $240 USD. Well worth it. I've put some details on the tours below. I would highly recommend edadventures for a more personalized tour. Coba: We got to Coba about 8:30 in the morning and probably were the 2nd or third group there. We rented bikes (30 pesos) and we were happy we did. It's about 2km from the entrance to the main pyramid. Even early in the morning it was very hot. Coba is not as well restored as chitzanitza but well worth seeing. The main pyramid is higher and you are still allowed to climb it where you get a spectacular view of the area. They have a rope attached which helps going up and down as the stairs are steep and uneven. Lots of other ruins spread out over the jungle. We were there for a about 1 1/2 hours and by time we got back to the parking lot it was full of tour buses. All the bikes were rented and there were hundreds of people everywhere. The early start was well worth it. Snorkling (dos Ajos): After Coba we stopped into tulum where Edadentures has their shop. We met Eduardo and Bonnie and the people that needed snorkling gear got fitted up and we paid Bonnie . Ed then came with us and was our guide for the rest of the trip. Dos Ajos is part of a cave system that extends for hundreds of km's inland and emptys in the ocean. Dos Ajos is accessible from the main highway a few km's down a dirt road. Most of the cave had one side open to the jungle but there we a few parts that were completly in the cave. Ed made sure that everyone was fitted up with their equipment and were comfortable before he led the tour through the cave system. We were all given underwater flash lights. The water is crystal clear and you could see scuba divers swimming below. Would recommend wet suits (available from Ed) as the water is a little cool Akumal Bay..Last stop was snorkling at a reef in Akumal bay. There was only the 3 of us plus Ed for this part. We took a boat out to the reef and then snorkled back onto the beach. The water was little rough breaking on the reef so we could only snorkle on the leeward side. The reef is a lttle battered from the recent hurricanes with lots of debris but still some pretty good coral. On the way back we saw lots of sea turtles feeding on sea grass. Cozumel: Went over to Cozumel for a couple scuba dives with Papa Hogs Diving. Good operation, would recommend them. The rides on the ferry were pretty interesting. Real rough on the way over and even rougher on the way back. On the return trip they only took 1/2 the passengers allowed and then handed out barf bags to everyone. Never seen that before. A few people were getting sick but luckily it's only a 1/2 trip and I was glad to get back on land.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ok", "Title": "\u201cbooking nicer restaurants a hoax; don't pay for ocean view\u201d", "Author": "SJBAss0107", "ReviewID": "UR14641105", "Content": "All-inclusives usually offer a couple of \"nicer\" restaurants as an alternative to the buffet.

Long story short (won't belabor our day-to-day efforts and the resort's day-to-day excuses, like you have to stay at the resort for at least 2 weeks before you can book in advance...) cause what actually happened the night we ate at the Japanese restaurant illustrates the point so well. 10 of our party was allowed to make reservations at 6:30 on Sat. evening. couldn't get the other 7 in cause already overbooked and our 10 people \"took up entire place\". See pic of \"fully booked\" rest. taken at 6:45 pm, with similar ones at 7:15 and 7:45. In the first hour the rest. had at most 17 people (3 tables).

Message to her - I don't appreciate being lied to. Ditto to male concierge who rotated his computer screen to show me how 'booked\" each rest. was during our stay (excel-type spread sheet with about 20 numbers in 5 columns with no labels and, frankly, no apparent meaning).

The beach is pretty small and they have packed lots of chairs in the limited space. Even though there seemed to be lots of chairs, it was very difficult to actually find a chair that wasn't taken. Also, the beach was Red Flagged 5 of the 7 days. The pool was a good size and was not overly busy in the water. The kid's area is isolated in one corner of the pool, which leaves a large area for everyone else. It was very difficult to find a beach chair!!! People reserver chairs, and do so really early in the morning. We did get lucky and found two beach chairs everyday, but is was really annoying... a couple of times we dragged chairs from the beach. The rooms were more than adequate. The TV's weren't great, some channels had poor reception, but overall it met our very limited need for the TV. Two queen beds, kind of hard, but sheets and pillows were clean. Shower was good, always had hot water. Some areas in the hotel are a little dated, but it was no big deal. We did check out the sister hotel, Viva Maya, it seemed a lot bigger and nicer. We only spent a few minutes there as we went to the night club there one night.

I enjoyed the pool and we both enjoyed lazing on the beach. The water at the beach was a bit rought most imes but we did manage to find some calm spots that allowed us to enjoy the Mexican waters. The buffets were good and we enjoyed dining in three restaurants . I believe our favorite was the Italian although we did enjoy the Porta Fina at the sister resort. The bar and food at the pool lounge was great and we enjoyed watching the moon after the entertainment and drinking my favorite the Blue Parrot and her's the Pina Cola Da. Don't expect luxury rooms but rest assured they are clean and quite roomy. We would have liked to be able to sit on the bacony and enjoy the morning sun but there was no room for chairs. That is the case for most rooms at the resort. The entertainment was amaturish but you have to admire the amount of energy the entertainers put into the performances .it was a great way to spend part of the evenings. We did a lot of waking outside the resort and felt comfortable doing so. It was about a twenty minute walk to Fifth Avenue but worth it. Wal Mart is a little farther by the Tequila is cheaper there.

After myself having a very rough year health wise, we both felt that it was time to relax and enjoy married life. I researched several different resorts on line and showed my husband the ones that i thought looked the best. From there, we went to our travel agent and booked at Viva Azteca. We were so much looking forward to relaxing in our ocean front, upper floor, king-sized bed, non-smoking, quiet room. Upon arrival, the reception were not very welcoming or friendly. We both brushed it off, and continued to our room. As soon as i walked in, i burst into tears. It was the complete opposite to what we had booked: ground floor, double bed, a view of a chain link fence, adjoining room, and it was smoking. We headed back to the front desk with our confirmation of our room from our agent, and said that this was not what was booked and it was unacceptable. Reception pretty much shruged their shoulders and said that they never received confirmation, but there was one other room available and that we were able to go and take a look. It was a bit better, but still double sized bed, ground floor, and it was right outside the lounge where music plays anywhere between 12-2am. I was so unhappy, but we moved as it was non-smoking and were told that we could look at another room on sunday. I cried for hours because i was so unhappy with everything. We moved again on Sunday, still not the room that we originally booked, but was a bit better. The only thing that was good about our holiday was the sun, and my husband. The beach was nice, but it would have been nice to have been notified about all the sandbags along the coast. Not the most attractive things to look at.

My kids are 8 and 11. My husband and I were so impressed by this small quaint resort which gave us everything we were looking for in a family vacation. Good food, clean resort inside and out, great activities for the kids...and for us..lol, great entertainment, super staff , nice beach with palm trees, white sand, etc, etc. What more can one ask for ? We've been to other resorts with the kids over the years and we liked this one the best by far. I think the biggest reason was that it offered a more intimate, quiet, relaxing and family friendly setting which is what we were looking for. I felt like I didn't have to keep my eyes on the kids 100% of the time because they were always right there where we can see them....having fun, playing in the pool, having a slushie at the pool bar, or playing games with the entertainment staff. The pool isn't huge and isn't that deep either. I believe it only goes up to almost 5 feet. There is a children's pool area for the little ones. There's also an area which is just a few inches that you can lie down on and sunbathe. The snack bar at the pool is great! They treat you well and I didn't even have to use my cooler cup because the cups were a fair size. The food here was good. You get your basic burger, hot dog, yummy tacos, fries, pasta, rice, chicken nuggets, etc. Also beside the pool and facing the beach, is a massage hut, where I had a great massage! and just in front of that is a whirlpool. We were really lucky to have a room right beside the pool/snack bar so when we'd get up in the morning, my husband would go out through the sliding door, get a cappucino, put some towels down on the chairs and then we would sit on the deck and have our drinks while waiting for the kids to wake up. It was such a nice start to each day. Luckily it wasn't that noisy at night like I thought it would be. There were just faint sounds coming from the snack bar. The beach was good and wasn't as big as I expected but really kept clean by the staff. There was two visible sandbags, one on one side of the resort and one on the other side. None in the centre which would obstruct your beautiful view of the ocean. We were able to go swim in the ocean but had to stay close to shore with my younger child because of the big waves. There's always a lifegueard right there watching attentively. If you like the shade, there's palapas on the beach as well as some palm trees. Ofcourse you have to get out early to get your chairs where you want them. If not, no worries, you'll always find a chair, even in the afternoon, that you can move under a tree and get some shade. We walked over to the Maya and their beach is much bigger but seem to have more sandbags. We loved the beach party at the Azteca where they served paella, seafood and punch and we danced salsa and merengue with the entertainment staff. Wow, that entertainment team is something else!!. I've never seen an entertainment team so enthusiastic, friendly, outgoing and energetic. I fell in love with them! Their shows at night were good but started at 9:45 which is a little late for the kids who are tired at that time. They had a mini-disco for the younger kids at 8:30pm which my younger one partaked in. We saw the Michael Jackson show, the Hollywood show and International show. All of them were entertaining and although maybe not as professional as others, they were fun to watch. My 11 year old loved them all and fought to stay awake just to watch the shows! The buffet restaurant was suprisingly really good. I went in with low expectations about the food and came out quite impressed with what they had to offer. A good assortment with changes everyday and some really tastey, deliscious meals. The kids, who are picky eaters, always found something they liked like pasta made up the way they like it at the pasta bar, chicken, rice, ribs, fajitas, grilled meat, etc. They had tacos with salsa and guacamole evey night. I miss that! We ate at Il Palco(Italian) and Bamboo(Japanese), Both very good! They don't have a kids menu but my kids were able to find something they liked from the menus. The reception area staff could work on improving their ability to accomodate customers in times of need with more efficient service and more flexibility eg. check-out times. Ok, so everything was almost perfect! We did one day trip to Tulum and Xelha and had a blast! This was an amazing family vacation and a great value as well for our family. I miss my merengue and salsa lessons, water aerobics, spanish lessons, crazy games...and just chilling out by the pool or on the beach with my pina colada. I miss everything about this little jewel in the middle of Mexico!

Reception: Check in was quick and efficient. Any problems we did have were looked after right away eg: spraying the room, towels delivered etc. Accomodations: Our room was in the \"c\" building ....just off of the lobby. Some rooms had tiny wee balconies that you could not sit out on, ours was one you could. My sisters family had to move from this building, as they were right above the entertainment area of the resort next door.(Extremely loud). Our room was spacious, two queen beds, very hard mattress(but still slept like a rock), and closets with plenty of room to put your clothes in. The bathroom area was a nice size with double sinks. We never had problems with lack of water pressure, and always had hot water. There were mosquitos in our room, and we did get some nasty bites on our legs (just praying they weren't bed bug bites). Our maid service was lacking, our room was never cleaned before 4pm, and she missed our room completely one day. Food: Buffet was ok, nothing special. Never left hungry. Omelette egg bar or pasta bar is always a bonus. pool/snack bar had some light fare....hamburgers, natchos....great for the midday when your covered in sunscreen, and don't feel like a sitdown meal. Also very convenient for our kids. We ate at the italian restaurant....My pasta dish and ceasar salad was good, but some dishes were hit and miss with our family. The service was ok (they certainly try) The Bamboo(japanese) restaurant was good in my opinion. my spring rolls were great, and my chow mein noodles were spicy and tender. Service again...was ok. We tried to get into the mediterranean restaurant at the sister resort \"Maya\". They could only offer us 2 seats. We went and begged for two more seats the night of the reservation....without success. My husband and my son sat at a table for 4 with a restaurant half empty. I had read about this in other reviews...and it quite frankly baffles me??????? Certainly not good PR. Pools/Beach Pool area was great...nice and relaxed, close to food and drinks....seemed clean. I also liked the fact that there was no swim up bar, therefor....less pee in the pool. The loungers around the pool went quickly, so we did put our towels out early. Having said that.....we spent some days at the pool, and some days at the beach, so as not to monopolize the pool area. The beach was nice, loads of shade... very wavy most days...some snorkeling on the other side of the sand bags. Most often the water is too churned up too see alot. The water was warm, and we had great fun with the boogie boards. the beach itself.. has a fairly large area with palm trees, and palapas.... We witnessed a wedding there....very pretty. OH and if you have never been to this area...the colour of the water is phenomenal!!! Aqua/blue/green.....very picturesque. Very few people selling things on the beach, and those that were were extremy pleasant, and not pushy. Property/Staff: The property itself is kept clean, and landscape is simple yet quaint. the kids club is very small, my son used the \"Maya\" for archery and a few other things. They have a gym and spa, which we never used. The massages/hair braid prices can be negotiated....we were going to get two full massages and two partial hair braids for $125. As said prior the staff at reception were very helpful. The wait staff, bartenders,maids, etc, were all friendly. The activation staff tried hard, and I loved that they didn't push you into things, but always tried to include everyone...the shows were...well....pretty bad, but great to watch all the same, they sure do try! The sister resort \"Maya\" is much bigger, has more to offer, but the buffet we tried was not so good, the pool was dirty, the landscaping and property was very nice and the shows were done on a larger scale, and were better than the azteca. However, I loved the intimacy of the azteca. Bars/nightlife: The lobby bar has great leather furniture scattered about, which lends to a very relaxed atmosphere. The drinks offered were vast...I saw people ordering premium liquor, mojjitos, all kinds of frozen drinks, they had great cappucino, and iced cappucino. The beach bar, was more casual...with juices and and water that was self serve, again the coffee in the mornings....just sitting out overlooking the pool and the ocean was wonderful! The thing that surprized me the most was the lack of tipping! The staff do not give preferential treatment to people who do tip. They treat everyone the same. they are courteous and friendly always. I just was shocked at how little people did not tip. TIP PEOPLE!!!!! You would at home! These people work there butts off! Often there were booths set up in the lobby courtyard, photo opportunities, and a mexican night, with treats for the kids (cotton candy) and treats for the adults (tequila). there was always music in the lobby, and a live little band in the lobby bar at night.

This was our first trip to Mexico and we were very happy with our choice of resort and location. The weather was fantastic. The food was good, no complaints. The buffet was good, something for everyone. The Bamboo restaurant was good, the Italian was great. We did not eat at the Mexican restaurant. The snack bar was excellent especially the burgers, fries, pizza. There was always plenty of food and it was open 24 hours. The drinks were good especially at the Mexican bar (close to reception). The pool looked great, very clean. We spent all of our time on the beach. As many people already mentioned, alot the beach was lost as a result of the hurricanes. However, our resort was one of the lucky ones to at least keep some of the beach. We were always able to get some chairs and the staff kept the beach clean. It was very safe on the beach. We left our bag, towels etc. and was never touched. There were some people trying to sell their stuff but were never pushy or bothersome. The ocean was very rough for about 3 or 4 days, but we just swam to the left of the little bridge. It was somewhat calmer. The entertainment staff were very nice and energetic, especially Smiley (my nickname for him) as he was always smiling and he was very funny. The shows at night were OK. You might want to check out some of the shows at the Maya (sister resort). We found them to be more professional. The Maya also has a disco, (the Azteca does not) but I can't say what it was like as we never did make it there. If there was a negative thing about this resort it is the rooms. Don't get me wrong, they were very big and always clean, but were very outdated. We were put in a room right next to the Bar (close to reception). I think it is 'C' block (in the 3000). Don't let them put you here. It was very loud and the room we had was very dingy. We were finally moved our third day there. The reception staff kept telling us to come back and check later. I guess the hotel was fully booked. Our second room was much better. Playa del Carmen was every shoppers dream. We walked to it a couple of times however it is more like a 20 to 25 min. walk from the resort. There is a very big store near the beginning of the shops that has a large sign that says the best prices. Don't believe it as they were not. There is also a Walmart about another 4 or five blocks from the shops. We found this to be a little pricey believe it or not. We went on one excursion. We chose the Catamaran. It was fun.

It's a smallish (270 room) resort and it's size is it's greatest asset. You get to know the staff and see the same guests every day, so it is easy to meet people and chat. Walking from the beach past the pool to the lobby takes only a couple of minutes. There's a real mix of guests, mostly couples, friends, and families in the 30-60 age bracket. It is not a party resort (which was a plus for us - we can go into town for that, and there is some wicked partying in Playa del Carmen.) Most of the guests were Canadian, but there were also lots of French-speaking and German-speaking guests. It's more of a laid-back place to enjoy a week on the beach than a romantic spot for a honeymoon. We met some wonderful people there and really enjoyed ourselves. That said, there are some things potential visitors should know about. Even with the negatives or things to watch for, I would still recommend the Azteca without hesitation and would definitely go back. Flight We booked through Sunquest and had an Air Transat flight-share. We arrived at the airport plenty early (2+hours) but both coming and going, my husband and I were not able to sit together (probably a result of the plane's layout - 3 rows with 3 seats in each). I'd recommend paying extra to get pre-assigned seats if this is important to you. I'd also recommend bringing your own food or eating a decent meal before the flight - both ways we got a 250-300 calorie microwave meal that wasn't enough to fill either of us. Transfers Yes, it's true they offer cold Corona on the bus on the way to your resort, $3.00 each. Our guide, \"Handsome George\" cracked us up. Check-In and Room We'd requested (and the resort confirmed) a non-smoking, king size bed with a balcony on the 2nd floor or higher. When we checked in, we got a smoking room with two queen size beds on the ground floor. Sometimes smoking rooms are pungent, but this one was fine - we liked the room enough that we didn't request a change. My husband felt one of the beds was significantly more comfortable than the other; I didn't notice a difference. We especially liked the location of our room, near the pool bar. All of the rooms are between the beach and buffet so it's easy to stop in and change before going to meals. The air conditioning worked fine and we always had hot water for showers. We thought we'd sit out on the balcony but we ended up at the pool bar or lobby bar instead. Our room didn't have a coffeemaker, but since the pool bar made great cappuccinos and was only 30 seconds away, we just got our coffee there. The rooms are fine but not luxurious. There is no satellite TV, but there are a few English channels. And who goes south to watch TV? Late checkout is available for a $25 fee. We had to leave our room but got a newly renovated room off the lobby bar until 5:00p.m. which was very convenient. They also offer a free hospitality room for 30 minutes if you just want to shower before your flight, but you have to book it in advance at the front desk. You can do this the day of your departure, there were lots of times available to suit various flights. Beach We walked up and down the beach and other reports are correct - some hotels don't have much beach left. The Azteca's beach is lovely. The upper portion is studded with palm trees and palapas for shade, the first row of loungers are all in the sun. Lots of people do lay out towels to reserve loungers. To get a shaded lounger you had to go out with a towel by about 9:00 - 9:30ish; there were always loungers available in full sun. It wasn't hard to move loungers around to get whatever mix of sun or shade you wanted. The beach was red-flagged every day we were there but the first. It didn't stop us (or others) from going in. There was some surf, little undertow, and it was fine for anyone who is comfortable in the water. Beaches in Mexico are not lifeguarded as vigilantly as in Canada, so it's not the place to take risks. Off to the right, sandbags create a large, warm pool of water at the ocean's edge that would be a perfect spot for kids to play. North (left) from the beach, you can only walk past a couple of resorts before getting to private homes with retaining walls and no land access. (The RIU Palace next door really is palatial - if you're looking for a luxury vacation, this one looked wonderful.) To the South (right) we walked at least half a dozen resorts down, past the Maya. Generally, the morning is best for the beach - the sun comes up over the ocean and it's hot, hot, hot. In the afternoon, clouds roll in, and the winds come up. There is still lots of sun, but it's less consistent. We started moving up to the pool around 4:00p.m. There is no bar service on the beach, but you can walk 30 seconds for non-alcoholic drinks (water, great lemonade) or up to the pool bar (less than a minute away.) They offer plastic glasses, or bring your own insulated mug. (Make sure it has steel on the inside or everything you put in it after your vacation will taste vaguely of beer.) Some women went topless at the beach (maybe half a dozen over the week) but most wore swimsuits. The pool area required bathing suits. Pool The pool has a very shallow section (6\"), a kid's section, and a deeper section - all under 5' deep. It is quite small by resort standards. It was always warm. The loungers around the pool go fast - I was out as early as 7:45a.m. and never saw a free lounger before mid-afternoon. We had no trouble finding loungers after coming up from the beach around 4:00p.m. each day. Occasionally, staff would play music to get people engaged in activities but it wasn't constant or irritating. Bars The resort has two bars, a pool bar and a lobby bar. The pool bar was open 24hours and the staff never had a problem making us a hamburger even when we rolled in at 3:30a.m. after a night in Playa del Carmen. They also served fruit all day, pizza from time to time, and a few other things, like nachos, and some pasta. The lobby bar is a comfortable spot with leather chairs and a very friendly bartender (Hola, Victor!) I was grateful to see that the drinks weren't that strong, but if you want lots of alcohol all you need to do is ask. We found many of the mixed drinks really sweet, but the Cosmopolitans were great. Both bars serve fantastic cappuccino and espresso drinks. There is Splenda available everywhere, which was really nice for us, since that's what we use. I heard one tea drinker say she didn't like the one type of black tea they had. There were lots of types of herbal teas, but if you are particular about black tea, maybe bring some with you. Buffet The food at the Azteca is very good. Best items: homemade salsa and guacamole with chips, shredded pork, gelati (a different type every day and oh my god, it was good). There's an omelette bar in the AM, but I usually had toast and yogurt with fruit and museli. There was always spinach salad available, and you can make your own dressing with oil and balsamic vinegar. There were lots of meat choices, but no boneless chicken. I tried the pasta bar but it was only so-so - the sauce was more oil than tomato and very plain. Aside from the gelati, the desserts were hit or miss. Some great fruit tarts, but a lot of mousses which aren't to my taste. The desserts are not particularly sweet, nor are the pastries put out in the morning. A la Cartes Book a la cartes for the week ASAP after your arrival. We arrived very late (after mid-night) and by 11:00a.m. the next morning, we were told that the Mayan restaurant (Xul-Ha) was already fully booked for the week. (It is the most beautiful of all of the restaurants we saw - open air, with lights in the trees, just gorgeous.) Even when we'd been told a restaurant was fully booked, there were always empty tables - possibly no shows? If you're interested in a particular restaurant, it couldn't hurt to go there at 6:40 (they hold the tables for 10 minutes) and ask for a seat. We tried three of the a la cartes, Il Palco (the Italian), Portofino (the Mediterranean at the Maya), and Bamboo (the Asian). The Maya has a larger buffet - we went by one night but didn't try it. House wine is included at all three (and it's fine, unlike the buffet wine, which is not), and there is also a wine list where you can buy a bottle for $15 - $45. Yellow Tail Shiraz was $15, which is pretty reasonable. Service is friendly and fast at all of the a la cartes. Expect to be in and out in 60-80 minutes. Portions are smallish, fine for women, but perhaps not enough for men - if you ask, they will give you one additional dish to share. We got pasta a couple of times, as a side, as well as tempura. Temperature is a problem at all three a la cartes - the food often comes lukewarm. I discovered an inadvertent way to remedy the problem - I had a wonderful steak at Portofino, but it came underdone for me, so I sent it back and it came back perfect and piping hot. The fruit tart on the Portofino's dessert menu is excellent. We weren't wild about the Italian spot. The pasta wasn't hot and the tiramisu wasn't like any I've ever had - no cocoa, ladyfingers, marscapone or liqueur. I'd skip this one. Bamboo served us the single best dish we had on the trip - some of the best tempura I've ever had. It was fantastic. Overall, the desserts at the a la cartes weren't well done. I'd skip them and have a cappuccino and something sweet at the buffet if you want something more after the meal. Truthfully, there was nothing wrong with the buffet and they changed up the items enough that I could probably have eaten there all week. Gym There is a small gym at the Azteca, with free weights, some machines, and one of each cardio equipment - a treadmill, elliptical, and a bike. They also have yoga mats. (One of the entertainment team members does a daily stretching class on the beach that is about half stretching and half yoga - very nice.) The Maya Guests at the Azteca have full privileges at the Maya (4-5 resorts up the beach) but guests at the Maya don't have privileges at the Azteca. The buffet at the Maya is larger (many of the same items but more choices), they have a larger pool with a swim up bar, and rooms are available only steps away from the beach. It also has a book exchange in a cabinet in the lobby bar (the Azteca doesn't). The Azteca has a more comfortable lobby bar. Overall, if I had to choose between the two, I'd choose the Azteca, but I'd be hard pressed to articulate why. I think it was a prettier setting and I liked that it was smaller. Car Rental We rented a car to do a day trip to Akumal and Tulum. The resort didn't have any cars left, so they called another company that came to get us. Make sure the price you are quoted includes everything - especially the collision damage waiver. There was a note on the rental sheet that said it was included, then when we got to the lot, we were told it was an extra $20. I am pretty sure that this wasn't true, but it was late and we wanted to get on the road so we didn't argue. Changing Money We found it difficult to get 10 and 20 peso bills for tips - the exchange booth at the resort didn't have small bills. I'd suggest bringing $20 - $40 in American singles and getting small bills when you're in Playa del Carmen. Playa del Carmen Definitely go into town - 5th avenue is full of charming open air restaurants and bars, plus there are some nightclubs down by the beach that don't get going until after midnight. It is safe to walk, and takes about 15-20 minutes from the Azteca, but the walk through Playacar (the resort area) is a bit boring. Cabs are $5 from Playacar to anywhere in downtown PDC so it makes sense to get a cab into town and walk from there. You can take a cab to Calle 38 (the end of the tourist zone) and walk all the way back to the entry to Playacar in 45-60 minutes. The Paseo del Carmen outdoor mall is gorgeous and there is a Starbucks in a prime location near a fountain - a perfect spot to sit and people watch. The shopping is mostly of the souvenir-ish variety. Prices are surprisingly high, particularly in restaurants, where a meal will cost about the same as a meal in Canada or the USA. The Mayan Riviera is a great spot with lots of things to do, and the Azteca is a fine base to do everything from laying on the beach to any number of activities and excursions.", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood, but not a 4 star\u201d", "Author": "julez48", "ReviewID": "UR13906764", "Content": "We just returned from the Azteca, and had a pleasant vacation. It was very relaxed and is in a very good location. However, if you are expecting luxury, then the Azteca isn't for you. When we arrived at 12:00 noon, surprisingly they told us our room was ready, so were taken there immediately by a very friendly staff member. We had paid extra for a \"Superior Oceanview\", which turned out to actually be partial oceanview as far as I'm concerned, but it was still a good location, so didn't ask to change. The room reeked of stale smoke even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking room - including the pillows, however by the end of the week the smell was gone. The room, while not spotless, and had some issues with needing repair, was huge (since we were on the top floor, we had a vaulted ceiling which was nice). The rooms definately need more drawer/storage space because there is not enough. The area our room was in at the resort was unbelievably quiet. We never ever heard anybody in the other rooms, or even any disturbance from the beach, pool or pool bar. It was 1309 and I would recommend requesting this room if you are looking for a great location. The buffet food was really a hit and a miss. Some was good, some was awful, and there wasn't enough variety for me. However the Italian and Asian ala carte restaurants were very good. The \"Mexican\" which is really Mayan food was terrible, (but I think that's just personal taste) however you can forgive that since the atmosphere is wonderful. If you are a dessert person, you are tough out of luck. The deserts in all the restaurants are virtually non-existent. As many other reviews have said the staff is very friendly, and the animation team are very \"animated\" and fun to watch and ineract with. However, the shows are very amaturish, so if you're looking for good entertainment, skip the shows. If you are looking for a vacation where you can just sit and relax on the beach, without having to walk miles to get to the beach, the Azteca is for you. However, if you want a chair in a good location, be prepared to put your towels on your chair before 7:00 AM or you're out of luck. If you want a chair in the very noisy (full of kids) pool area, then you'll have to put your towel out the night before. The staff are all very friendly and while they don't necessarily understand our Canadian humour, try very hard, and all work like crazy to make sure you are comfortable. I've read in other reviews where people suggest tipping as a way to get better bar service or stronger drinks. I didn't find this true at the Azteca, we got the same type of service if we tipped or if we didn't. The location is very nice. The Playacar area is very pretty and clean and is an easy walk to Playa Del Carmen, which is a lot of fun and activity in the evening. For anybody going to the area for the first time I would warn you to take a lot of cash if you are shopping or spending any time off the resort. Credit cards are very rarely accepted, and are usually more of a hassle than not. (If you go to a local restaurant and are paying by credit card, the waiter will ask if you can still pay his tip in cash.) The weather was perfect and as other reviewers have said, the beach at the Azteca is so much nicer than any of the others around you in the \"fancier\" resorts. There is a large area to swim in the ocean, where the other resorts will have only 3 feet before you are stopped by a huge sand bag. The grounds are very pretty and very well kept. If you are not concerned with being in a top of the line resort, you'd be quite happy staying at the Azteca. It's much nicer than their sister resort. We would probably go back simply because the location and the staff and the nice small size. If I want luxury, I would try somewhere else.", "Date": "February 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sammamish", "Title": "\u201cModest resort-We were satisfied\u201d", "Author": "Sandradan", "ReviewID": "UR13892537", "Content": "Just returned from 10 days at Viva Azteca with 2-adults and 2-children ages 5 and 16 months. Booked the hotel and transfers through Apple Vacations. We were disappointed with Apple as the airport transfers were not arranged at the time of arrival. We had approximate 2-hour wait at the airport for a van to take us to the hotel. On arrival at the hotel, the front desk had no record of our booking. I had the email confirmation printed receipt and the email on my cell phone for both the transfers and the hotel. The front desk finally gave us a room (1-king size bed for 2-adults and 2-children). I read where others had the same issue at the Azteca as well. The front desk employees are least helpful of all the people at the resort. They did offer a small roll-away bed which we accepted. However, we had to call after a few hours because they failed to deliver. The following day another room was offered to us but we decided to stay with our room as it overlooked the pool and was close to the beach and we had already settled in. The rooms are modest and clean. There is a stocked refrigerator in each room which is very convenient. The pool gets crowded in the afternoon as does the beach area. As with most resorts in Mexico, people go early and lay towels on chairs and there are a limited amount of loungers. If we didn\u2019t see anyone utilizing the lounge chairs, we removed the towels and used them. A few people finally returned and muttered under their breath, but nobody confronted us. The pool is set up nice for kids. Many people write the Azetec has the best beach around. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s any better then the others, though. There are plenty of palapas for shade. The swimming area is slightly rocky. There is a non-alcoholic bar adjacent to the beach. We utilized the hotel hobbie cats once and the jet skis a few times. Topless bathing is allowed on the beach, but not in the pool area. There were always a few women topless on the beach. There are not many vendors on the beach. As soon as the main tourist season is over, the resorts are planning to import additional sand to the beaches. The food was good as far as all-inclusive resorts go. They staff is a little slow to clean the tables and to offer coffee in the mornings. The lunch buffet at the bar was understaffed as well as the bar itself. Sometimes there would be a 10 or 15 minute wait. We did not eat at the other 3-restraurants at the resort. Our 5-year old did get sick (I assume from the food). He had severe vomiting for a 24 hour period. I did not hear of anyone else being ill during our stay. The kids club was very good and professional. My 5 year old spent limited time there, but the girls were very good with the kids. The entertainment staff was fine. They had several activities throughout the day to involve the guests. As far as the nightly shows, they were too late for us (9:45 pm start time). We only went to 2-shows. We stayed at several all-inclusive resorts in Mexico in the past and the shows at the Azteca were by far the least professional and rehearsed. The resort is very clean and the grounds well kept. It is smaller, although we personally prefer that. They do not have wireless internet service which is a disappointment as most resorts are going that direction. I did have my air card and computer with me so it wasn\u2019t really any issue. I did notice people waiting to use the computers. There are no elevators at the resort. If you have young children requiring a stroller or are physically hindered, I would suggest requesting a ground floor unit. One issue that bothered as at other resorts in the past is the amount of people smoking. We really did not encounter that here. Not once did we notice anyone smoking at the buffet. As far as activities outside the resort, we went to Xcaret. If you decide to go, I would recommend taking a taxi and buying your entry tickets at the gate. People told us they paid between $120 US to $210 US per person for Xcaret. We paid $12 each way for a taxi and $69/each for the entrance fee. The booking agents will try to tell you different, but the package you buy at the gate and the package you buy form the agents include the same thing. For $69 we received entrance to the park, the underwater river tour, snorkeling, towels, 1-snack each and one buffet as well as the show at the end of the day. If you decide you want to go back, you can purchase a second day for \u00bd price as you leave. Children\u2019s tickets are \u00bd the adult and children under 40 inches are free. My kids really enjoyed the park. We even took our 16 month old on the cenote tour. It is a nice diversion from being at the resort.

My husband & I (mid 40's) just returned from a weeks vacation at the Viva Wyndham Azteca. Chose this resort as a selloff with ITravel 2000 & heard the sister resort, the Maya was on a much larger scale & yes it was. Too many kiddies & very, very noisy. Beach - Excellent area & would definitely return again. The beach was very nice in this area & have been to other resorts in the past and was definitely the best right now in this area due to the storms. We walked from the Reef Playacar right down to the last resort on the beach which is the sandols caracol (new). Very nice beach at the end of the strip. Always keeping the grounds clean & the beach area is done daily including picking up glasses & dishes. Chairs are always available but chose to get the one of our choice early morning. Pick up a cushion (very few) for your lounge chairs if you can because if not, they are not the most comfortable. Went out on a catamaran & was very relaxing & was a calmer day @ Sea. The water temperature was very warm. Accomodations -check was very quick being as we were delayed with SunWing 7 hours & at first, we were put in a ground floor room close to the entainment & also was very musty in the room. They were very accomodating & moved the next day to the 2nd floor closer to the beach overlooking the pool & was an oceanview. Maid service was awesome & be sure to tip, they work very hard & do an awesome job. Food - very good but not gourmet. You wouldn't starve that's for sure. Al a carte dining was very slow & under staffed & including the bars. We always had a lineup & don't forget your thermal mugs for drinks. They will fill them no problem & good for the frozen drinks keeping them longer. No premium liquors such as Baillies Irish Cream, had Amaretto but not Disaronno (the best) . Also NO caesar mix & only served Bloody Marys which seemed very popular. LOTS & LOTS of tequila obviously. Big selection for drinks always. We chose the Italian & the Mexican & preferred the Italian. The buffet and only once to choose from other than at the beach grill, had a large variety always. Breakfast was the best with the omelettes & made fresh in front of you. Coffee was sparse @ times & had to walk around looking for a server. The cappucinos at the bars were excellent especially at the bar down by the beach. The grill @ the beach served hamburgers(the best), hotdogs, pizza, chicken, fish, salads, fresh fruit always & the list is endless. Shopping - always walked to Playa del Carmen which was a 15 minute walk & could take a cab which was $5.00. The market is called 5th Avenue & lots of Silver jewellery (925). Don't forget to bargain with them. Also there is a small shopping area to the left of the resort in Playacar (5 minutes) for souvenirs also & phones are available also. There is also a WalMart away from 5th Avenue, off the beating track which we checked out also. OVERALL - Thank you for reading my review & would recommend this resort for all travellers & can't wait to return next year. Always choose Mexico & were in Cozumel on the island last year at the Melia Cozumel, very nice also.

From the beach, to the pool, to the food, to the hotel room. This hotel is simply AMAZING! The only thing i didnt like was the door seperating the rooms. You were able to hear the ppl beside you talking, or doing whatever.. there wasnt much privacy. However, the fridge was always fully stocked with bottled water, juice and beer. The workers were always so smiley, and greeting you daily, all day with an HOLA! The beach was beautiful, the best beach on the WHOLE strip! They took great care of it, and kept it clean! The food was AMAZING! Everyday they changed your food option, and it was always good! I highly reccomend the pasta, and the cheese fries!!This hotel truly makes you feel like you've left home for a few weeks, and gone to paradise.

We arrived at the resort at 6:00 am and were able to check in with no problems and were shown to our room which was quite spacious , with two double beds, which were actually quite firm and comfortable, and a large bathroom.It had airconditioning that worked' very' well too.The chambermaids really did a good job of keeping the room clean. We always had a good supply of clean towels, lots of bottled water in the fridge and everynight when we returned to the room there was another animal figure made from towels on our bed. We never had any problems with ants or any type of bug, even though they fumicated the room one morning. We left a tip every morning for the maids and I don't know if it was the reason we never had any problems with anything or not, but they did an excellent job . They were very friendly too and always had a cheery smile and greeting whenever we would see them. The food was alright, have had better and have had alot worse at other higher rated resorts. We only ate at the buffet and never went to the Ala carte restaurants as we never had any problems at the buffet. I'm alittle bit of a picky eater, but believe me I never went hungry.My wife was always saying she was eating too much and worried about putting on weight....go figure eh? Their chicken dishes were awesome.The only thing I thought was funny, was that not very often was there any bananas at the fruit table. nothing wrong with that, but most resorts I've been at have piles of bananas.Their coffee was surprisingly good too. Overall, we'd have to say the food was okay.The pool bar had good hambugers, hot dogs, fries, pizza and other food too and was open 24 hours so one could eat anytime they were hungry. The entertainment staff did a good job. some of them were so full of energy we wondered how they could go so hard for so long.They were always asking people to take part in the activities they had planned for the day. If you wanted to participate, they made it fun for you and if you didn't want to participate they didn't pressure you into it either. The entertainment staff were also the people who were in the shows at night. Most of the shows were really good for a bunch of amateurs, lots of singing and dancing. Their Movie show, the Lion King show, Micheal Jackson show and Moulan Rouge show were awesome. The cabaret show, a comedy , ........well....it sucked bigtime and was definitely not for kids.After the shows which didn't start until 9:45, the staff usually came down to the bar in the commons area and danced with anyone who wanted to dance and generally had a good time as well as made it fun for the people staying there. They definitely were a friendly bunch. The beach was small but from what we saw, probably the nicest one along there. The hurricanes have definitely done damage to the beaches. We spent everyday on the beach except for one which we spent at the pool. We found it to be too hot around the pool area. Anyway, I can swim in a pool anyday, but the ocean not to often so chose to be on the beach. In the late afternoon, usually around 5:00, we would walk into Playa Del Carmen for coffee at Starbucks and ice cream at Burger King or MacDonalds. From the front steps of the resort to the Macdonalds on 5th ave it is a about a 15 minute walk at a brisk clip. If you powerwalked you'd get there faster, but who the heck wants to powerwalk in that heat.Ladies you will be glad to know there is a Walmart there too. Corner of 8th st and 25th Ave. About 5 blocks west of 5th ave on 8th. It's a nice liesurely walk into Playa and quite safe too as there seems to be lots of tourists on the sidewalk, at least in the early part of the evening.The only problem we had was with certain other tourists who seem to think they own the sidewalk and wouldn't get over to let people past when they met them.Same ones would cut into lines at the bar and buffet too, not wanting to go to end of line like everyone else. We heard several people,from our resort and from others too,talk about this, although what could you do. Don't know what the rules if etiquette are on the other side of the Atlantic, but are different than this side for sure. We would recommend this resort to anyone and wouldn't think twice about staying there again. It is what it is and if if you want 5 star plus treatment, go to Vegas. We enjoy the fact it is a little rustic. Makes us realize how good we have it back home.Had a great time.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria BC", "Title": "\u201cGood time at the Azteca\u201d", "Author": "DragonladyVictoriaBC", "ReviewID": "UR13390702", "Content": "Date: Feb 8th 2008 Reviewer: Judy from Victoria BC We are retirees from Canada and this was our first experience of a fully all-inclusive. Overall it was a very good experience. The food , while not gourmet, was quite adequate in quality and variety. We weren't very impressed with the Italian restaurant but we thought the Xul-Ha was good. We aren't heavy drinkers but enjoyed some sampling of the huge variety from the bars. We particularly enjoyed the local Yucatan liqueur known as Xtabentun which is probably available nowhere else on the planet. Personally we wouldn't recommend the house wine, although the white is slightly better than the red. As has been said by others, the rooms are basic but spacious and the maids have an amazing repertoire of towel sculptures. We found our room to be pretty quiet and the beds reasonably comfortable as Mexican beds go(they have the usual concrete platform instead of a boxspring, but a decent mattress). The main annoyance about the room was the absence of any tea or coffee making facility. If you need an early morning brew it's a nuisance to get dressed and walk a fair distance to the buffet or snack bar. The lack of an elevator was also at times lamented by my 70 yr old husband, although we only had one flight to walk up. The quantity and quality of the activities available on site were impressive. It was my first time out on a catamaran and I enjoyed it immensely. The water gym and aerobics were good too. The children seemed to enjoy their activities and the staff were all very friendly and positive. The free bicycles are a bit dicey. They are heavy clunky one speeds with a peculiar brake that involves pedalling backwards and often doesn't work-try several before taking one out. They are just about adequate to ride into Playa del Carmen, which would otherwise be a somewhat tedious walk in the heat. There are some Mayan ruins about half way into town. Although we could almost have enjoyed spending the whole week in situ, we did do two excursions out. Xcaret is well worth the somewhat steep admission price and the all inclusive Xcaret Plus is the better deal if you plan on snorkelling the underground river. The evening show is an amazing colourful spectacular of culture and history.. We also went to Chichen Itza on a Gray Line tour we had prebooked online. Apart from the magnificence of the ruins, it's actually the best place to shop for souvenirs. There are hundreds of vendors on site creating a market atmosphere where bargaining is expected and even the starting prices generally lower than 5th Avenue in Playa. All in all, the hotel was a good place to spend time and also a reasoanble base for excursions.", "Date": "February 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cOverall, a very good hotel- Recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Cazlin", "ReviewID": "UR13267326", "Content": "Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay at the Viva Azteca. I would definetly recommend the hotel to other guests. I broke my review down into categories. Rooms: The Good: The rooms are basic like every other 4 star hotel in Mexico. We enjoyed that the rooms were fairly large. We had a very nice view of the beach (from our room.) There are no elevators, but this is not a problem because they help you with your luggage both when you arrive and leave. The shower and toliet are seperate from the sink, which is nice for a couple as one person can be showering while the other is getting ready. There is a mini-fridge which they re-fill each day and a safe in each room which you code yourself. The bads: Our deck was too small to fit two chairs on- so you could only stand on the deck which was a dumb design, but the rooms below had large enough balconies. Thats it! Location: The Goods: We loved the location. It is in Playacar, which is a gated community and very up-scale, however, there is still taxis and lots of things to do in this neighbourhood. You are walking distance from PLaya del Carmen (about a 15min walk) or a $5 cab ride into town. The beach was small, but very nice, the sandbags are not so pretty, but VERY important to keep the beach- if you walk either way on the beachs you will see that the Azteca beach is very nice compared the surrounding ones. The bads: The only bad thing I can think of its that you are not in a neighbour where you can catch a Collectivo, so if you wanted to go far it is expensive to pay for a cab to take you far and we had hoped to use the Collectivos for this but you have to go into Playa del Carmen to get them. Cleanliness: Goods: The maids do a great job of keeping the rooms clean- they work hard, so make sure and tip them! :D Everything was very clean. Bads: Nothing. Check-in: Bads: We did not enjoy the young lady who assisted us at the front desk, we found her to be very rude and quite short with us. When asking if we could stay in our rooms for a few hours past check out, we were simply told NO. She didn't even check our room number, we offered to pay the $25 (as it says you can in the hotel book) but she simply refused. We dealt with her on two occassions and found her to be very rude both times. Good: We went back and asked about staying in our room later to another gentleman and he was VERY helpful- so this changed our impression of the front desk staff. Service: Good: The service was EXCELLENT! The staff are personable and friendly. They work so hard. I never had a problem or found any of the staff to be unprofessional or rude (except for the ONE front desk girl.) They need to be commended for their hard work. Well done! Bad: Nothing. Food: Good: The buffett was excellent. Always something new and never the same food- make sure you get an omlette from the omlette lady! The carte restuarants were okay- I wouldn't recommend the new one, Xul-Hal. But I would recommend Portofinno and Marimara (spelling?) from the Viva Maya, just down the street. Bad: The menus at the Carte restuarants are very similar. Make sure you try the Bamboo restuarant, it would be very different from the rest. Drinks/Bars: Good: You can get anythign you want! And if they don't know what it is or how to make it, they will still try. The bar staff were EXCELLENT, very friendly and very professional. Bad: Often, there was a line up at the bar. The staff would work VERY hard to make sure there wasn't but sometimes, there simply was. Value: Overall I thought the value of the hotel was excellent. We really enjoyed our stay. We would recommend, and already have, this hotel to others. We stopped by the Viva Maya and heard good things about that hotel, but we were there long enough for me to comment. I would say, know that you AREN'T going to a 5 star hotel, but a very solid 4 star- clean rooms, good food, nice beach, good entertainment and great staff. What else do you need?

The food was marginally better in the restaurants as it was freshly prepared but still just average. By no means did anyone ever go hungry but if you are looking for a fine dining experience you will be disappointed. We also visited the big sister resort a few blocks down - Viva Wyndham Maya - and definitely feel that we made the right choice by staying at the Azteca. The Azteca just has a better feel - smaller, intimate and less chaotic. We also stayed for a few days at the Wyndham Cozumel - which was very good and surpassed the Azteca in all categories (except the entertainment staff). If you are going to just plop yourself at a resort and not leave it, I would suggest you take the ferry and go to the Wyndham Cozumel versus the Azteca. We would certainly consider staying at the Azteca again for a few days but would not pay any more than we did as the price/value would become unbalanced - yes we are budget conscious travelers.

It worked well. The rooms were pleasant, the restaurants quite serviceable. The staff generally helpful, save and except for one desk clerk with an attitude of Germanic precision [one bad apple is easy to overlook]. Many of the staff were fantastic, and anticipated our needs rather than just responded to requests. When you check in, I recommend that you immediately make dinner reservations for the three special restaurants. If you are there for a few days and like to dine, say at 8, you may need to make the reservations well in advance to get that time. The same goes for the tennis [with only one court] and sailing. Being spontaneous will likely cause you to learn that the spaces available for that seating period are full. We also learned of a limitation on the ability to use restaurants in the other Wyndham resort up the beach. When we were there, there was a 6 person maximum on the size of a group that could pre-book a dinner at the other hotel for each seating period [a problem if your group is larger]. With respect to the internet, I would urge visitors to join the Wyndham \u201cBy request\u201d points club, as it gives you a free hour of internet during your stay [and it costs nothing to join, as well I suspect it may increase yoiur chance of getting an upgrade].

The best feature was its beach, which is one of the better ones in the immediate area. Plentiful palapas and palm trees provided shade for northern white skin and the swimming was protected with sandy bottom. No reef within access of beach but still fish to be seen while snorkeling. The pool was terrific too - very clean and refreshing. We loved an exhilarating swim in the ocean surf, followed by a shower and swim in the pool. A full day of activities were offered if you were interested by a staff that was friendly and welcoming but not overbearing. The food was not bad in the buffet - with lots of fresh vegetables and fruit and a variety of other dishes (what is with the fried chunks of hotdogs at every meal including breakfast though!?) But the buffet would have been tiresome without the six a la carte restaurants, including those at the Wyndham Mayan. The restaurants were very good, provided lots of variety, nice atmosphere and great service. It was pleasant to go for an evening stroll down to the Mayan to eat dinner and check out their show, which was different than that offered at the Azteca. On the way to the Mayan is Playacar Plaza, a very nice quiet shopping centre with a variety of arts and crafts - nicer and quieter than those found at Playa del Carmen and not as expensive as the market at the hotel (avoid this). It is also an advantage to be within walking distance of Playa del Carmen and the ferry to Cozumel. (If you like to snorkel, a ferry to Cozumel and a $5.00 taxi to Chankanaab Park is a good trip - you can snorkel off the beach there). Location also good in that it is only about 10 km from Xcaret, also a good day trip if you haven't been there before. The rooms could use a little updating but the beds were comfortable, the linen fresh and clean and the showers had lots of hot water - really what more could you need with paradise outside the door. The other benefits of the resort outweighed a little bit of shabbiness in the rooms. Also it was quiet at night, catering mostly to couples and families.

We booked online and had based our decision largely off of the reviews on this site. We were both really pleased with our decision. One of our favorite parts of this trip was Playa Del Carmen. The hotel is so close to town that you can walk there in about 15 minutes or borrow one of the bikes from the hotel and get there in 5. I was suprised at how modernized yet authentic the town was. There were mariachi's running by but also stunning modern architecture. We really enjoyed the shopping and restaurants there. The food at the hotel was also very good! The buffet was great with a different menu and look each night and the staff were absolutely great! They were very attentive and friendly. Out of the three restaurants that you can visit instead of the buffet we went to the Italian and the Mexican one. The food at the Italian restaurant was very good and it had a romantic ambiance. The Mexican restaurant had a very nice ambiance, good presentation, and the food was good but not as tasty as the Italian. We walked a stretch of the beach to check out other resorts and I thought that the Viva Wyndham had one of the nicer beaches. A lot of the resorts have large sandbags in the water (I guess to prevent erosion from the storms.) and this resort has them but they don't interfere with the sandy area like they do at some of the others.

There were two families, including five teenagers, in four rooms. For the most part our stay was pleasant and the service very good. We found the food a bit bland after a week but this is usually the case at all inclusive resorts which cater to such a large variety of clientele. There were two dark spots in our vacation. The first was Sunquest's ridiculous night flight schedule which had us checking out of our hotel at noon Saturday and taking off from Cancun at 5 a.m. on Sunday. This dispite the fact that our reservations said we were checking out on Sunday and the desk clerk acknowledging that we had only been at the hotel for six nightsand had paid for seven. Anyway, it made for an extremely long two days. The second dark spot was a series of bug bites that my daughter and I suffered which got progressively worse through the week. We assumed they were mosquito bites or sand fly bites and never clued into the fact that no one else had them. Anyway, long story short, the bites are actually bed bug bites. This does not suggest proper fumigation techniques which was very disappointing considering the $$ that we spent on this vacation. This was a pleasant resort with some glitches but I would certainly not recommend it because of the questionable cleanliness. It is very difficult to get rid of bed bugs and they spread like wild fire. It will be a bit of a task to make sure we have not transported any home in our luggage.

We went 4 yrs ago and 3 yrs ago. Four years ago you could walk on the beach for an hour in each direction. To the left: Playa del Carmen and to the right to a private cove. Then came Hurricane Dean followed by Wilma. Now you can only walk a few hotels over in each direction. To the left you can pop up on to the neighbouring streets with their pretty vacation homes and Mayan ruins and make your way to town. Rooms Clean and bright. Small TV with cable (BBC World, CNN International, a CBS channel plus Mexican stations). Bathroom has a standard bath with shower. Shampoo/soap in dispenser and a bar of soap by the sink. Blow dryer. Mini fridge that was stocked with juices, water, and beer, replaced every day. We had 2 double beds that were very firm\u2014which we like. We asked for extra pillows (the bed comes with 2) and they were brought right away. You should see how they clean the room daily: squeegee the windows, mop the floors\u2026a deep cleaning. Good reading lights by the bed. No clock/clock radio. The room has a terrific blackout curtain. Limited storage space: 2 small drawers and 2 cubbies plus the top shelf of the closet. A few hangers. Beach As I said, the beach has taken a hit from the hurricane but it is one of the better beaches in the area. They have put in these gigantic sand bags that looked like beached whales to prevent further erosion. They are ugly but do the trick. They create lovely shallow areas that are sheltered from the waves for the younger set. Many of the beaches now have rocky shores and the Azteca one does not. It\u2019s perfect sand and stunning Caribbean water. We played in the waves for hours. No undertow. My kids 8 and 11 were comfortable in it. We did not take out any boats, so no comment. Great sand for playing. Pool Glorious. Clean. Pleasant temp. It has 2 shallow sections (6 inches and 1 foot) for kids, plus lots of room for lap swimming, games, aqua gym (fun!) Guests Lots of families and extended families were there when we were. Young kids, teens and grandparents. About half the people seemed to be from Canada and the other half were Americans, Brits, Germans, Dutch, Austrian and French from France. A very nice mix. Not an agressive crowd. Food Terrific selection of healthy food. Pasta bar at lunch and dinner. Omelet and egg grill for breakfast. Always a number of things on the grill for lunch and dinner: fish, beef, fajitas. Lots of steamed veggies, soups, salad fixins. Very clean. It\u2019s not 5-star. On Xmas eve they did 5-star and I saw the difference. Smoked salmon, exotic fruits. Just more fancy and more selection. For dessert, every meal had melons and other fresh fruits plus traditional Mexican dessert flans. No brownies or more American style desserts. There\u2019s a main buffet that\u2019s covered and is open into a fabulous traditional courtyard. This is what I think of when I think of the Azteca. It\u2019s absolutely charming. You can also eat in the courtyard. The other side of the courtyard is a very cosmopolitan (International) feeling bar and lounge. Every night they have live talented performers. There\u2019s also an almost all day snack bar by the pool with fruit, pizza, and a number of hot items. Note: you would not believe the amount of smokers. Maybe we are sheltered from it all in Vancouver but this was something that bothered me from time to time. The restaurants are smoke free. It\u2019s in the lounge and the outdoor areas where you feel it most. The main bar, activity area, poolside all have smoking everywhere. You\u2019re doing aerobics and people are smoking right there. If the wind is right, it\u2019s in your face. I have asthma and this smoking thing is not so bad that I wouldn\u2019t return but it\u2019s a bit of a drag (ha ha). We forgot to ask for a non-smoking room and now I know what is the \u201cmusty\u201d smell that some people have mentioned. Our room actually didn\u2019t smell. It\u2019s some of the hallways that do. It\u2019s just stale cigarette smell. Request a non-smoking room. Activities Bikes \u2013 in bad shape! They need a major overhaul. In fact they took most of them away on our last day and we couldn\u2019t go riding as there wasn\u2019t a large enough one for my husband. No kids bikes. A few women\u2019s bikes with child carriers. Iffy brakes. Most bikes are coaster style. Lots of fun to ride around the area and into Playa. They give you locks too. Maybe the Maya has more and better bikes? Tennis One court only now (used to be 2). The activity sign says beginner tennis at 8 and expert at 9. Fact: sign up for courts is in the gym and you need to sign up 3 days in advance or all the slots are taken. No group lessons\u2014seems that you need to book \u201cprivates\u201d with the coach for the 8 or 9 AM slots. I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t do a group thing anymore. Disappointing. Ping pong 2 tables, often busy. Thank you so much to an earlier poster who suggested we bring our own paddles. We would play before and after the staff brought out the hotel\u2019s paddles. Gym\u2014didn\u2019t use but looked good Internet-3 computers. You buy time in the shop. 30 minutes for $2.50, usable in any increments. Kinda slow. Activities Most are offered daily step aerobics, stretching (on the beach!), salsa dance lessons, water aerobics, volleyball, bocce, darts. Staff are fun and good. They invite you to join in but don\u2019t push. It\u2019s a very warm atmosphere. The shows at night start at 9:45 \u2013found it hard to stay up this late. They are campy and fun. I love taking walks and this is one of the top reasons for choosing Azteca. Some resorts leave you very isolated. Here you can walk to a little shopping plaza/market across the road, opposite the Viva Maya about 10 minutes down the road. And you can walk to Play del Carmen in about 30 minutes passing ruins along the way. We went on one tour: to Tulum and Xel-Ha. It was 10/10. I\u2019ll post a report at the Tulum and Xel-Ha sites on Tripadvisor. Kids Club Some kids were definitely having an awesome time. My kids didn\u2019t want to join in. Oh well. They were happy in the pool and on the beach. Bug bites. Bring repellent. My husband and daughter didn\u2019t get any bites but my son and I did. The bugs really aren\u2019t bad and not an issue. In Conclusion We would return to the Azteca in a flash. It\u2019s charming, pretty, clean, friendly and well located for both its beach and proximity to Playa del Carmen and other tour destinations.

This property is a GREAT 4 star resort!! The rooms are not elegant, but spacios, very clean and well cared for. You have a minibar with beer, pop, water and juice to satisfy your thirst, and a pool bar that offers drinks and food 24hrs a day. The buffet does get a little old when you are staying 2 weeks like us, but we always find something to eat and do not have anything to complain about the quality and quantity of food offered at this resort. The Beach is fantastic, one of the best in this area. Most have been eroded by the hurricanes but the Viva's is still one of the nicest around. The water is warm, clear and was never really too wavy to swim in. Always chairs available when one is required, and the animation staff really try to get you up and involved in the daily activities. The shows are great (considering the animation team are putting these on) and i can not believe how much energy and enthusiasm they exert every day. They really work hard for the money they get. Playa Del Carmen is a 10 minute walk from the resort and we took advantage of the location to make this trip several times.....we just love 5th Avenue at night. This is the perfect location for a resort. Try to take a trip to the Xel-Ha park, this is worth much more that the $100US that we paid to visit here. Snorkeling, dolphins, animals, tubing...............too much to do all in 1 day. FANTASTIC trip. All in all this is a great resort for the money we paid. We had a great time and certainly would reccommend this resort to anyone with similar tastes as ourselves. Don't hesitate to book this resort.

Our check in was simple although they only had one bell boy to show people to their rooms and he was very busy. We had to find our own room but not big of a deal. Our room looked out over the volleyball court and the ocean. It was spotless from start to finish. We had a problem with our room safe but upon one phone call, they were there to fix the problem. We left our maid $5/day as a thankyou and we never had any problems. The fridge was topped up everyday with beer, water and pop. We ate at all the a-la-carte restaurants and enjoyed most of them. Our favorite was Xel-ha. We also ate at the mexican restaurant at the MAYA hotel on our final evening and really enjoyed the experience with a margarita upon arrival and free tequila. The soup was excellent! Buffet food was good but not great. We did not get sick or have any stomach problems from any of our meals. Despite the beach being surrounded by sandbags, the water was warm and comfortable to swim in everyday. Our first morning, it was extremely calm and we were able to snorkel around the sandbags and saw many different fish. They worked hard the rest of the week to keep the beach clean of seaweed an debris as the wind was gusty and the waves were intense at times. There were boogie boards,kayaks and catarmarans to enjoy for free. I played volleyball a couple of days and my wife enjoyed the aerobics in the pool. The animation and activity team worked hard to keep most guests busy and involved with their day to day activities. If you did not want to partake, it took a simple \"No, gracias\" and they would leave you alone. The evening shows were entertaining if you went in with an open mind. It must be hard for spanish people to lip-sinc english plays. They were entertaining enough to attend more than once but don't expect Vegas! We visited the MAYA hotel a few times but did not like it as much as the AZTECA. Our hotel was small(200 rooms) and quaint, the Maya(450 rooms) was very busy, loud and crowded. We enjoyed the quiet, moderate, pleasant pace of the Azteca. Most guests were from Italy but we did find some english couples to have drinks with from time to time. If you want a small, quiet, clean, affordable and friendly hotel that is close to town, YOU CAN\"T GO WRONG with the Azteca!! If you are looking for a party place with disco's and crowds, this hotel is not for you. We felt safe, never got sick, enjoyed the pool and beach, walked to town a couple of times, rented a car to see the ruins and cenotes, took the ferry to Cozumel, rented a scooter and toured the island snorkling etc. and got all our shopping done. We had a wonderful holiday but it would not have been as enjoyable if we did not like the hotel .......but we did!

There was no fan, so we left the A.C. on during the day (while we were at the beach) and slept with the sliding glass door open at night with the A.C. off. Pool was very nice and clean, though we never swam in it...we prefer the ocean. Not much to see snorkeling, but the water was warm, and clear and blue. Never once saw the entertainment at night...I wish they would start it earlier. We are early morning people and like to go to bed early....would be nice if the entertainment would start at 8 or 8:30. Too big of a gap between dinner and the entertainment. Would be nice if they had some live music during or after dinner...I think some people would like to dance...and it would help to keep the mood up.

We are a mid 30's couple and were here Nov 21 to 28th. We would recommend this place to anyone going to the Riviera Maya. PROS: Fast check-in, and check-out. Nice pool - I didn't swim in the pool myself but alot of people did. Its clean, and a good size. Great beach - compared to the other beaches in this area I would say this resort has the best beach by far. There are a few sandbags but that appears to be the norm since the hurricane damage. If you look at the other beaches in the area - many are left without any beach at all. The beach is clean, lots of chairs, many areas for shade, sun, or both. Very little seaweed, and very few vendors on the beach. Lots of choices for food - different theme each night in the buffet restaurant. Always some type of fish, chicken, beef, veggies - both cooked and raw, salads, fruit, desserts, ice cream, soups, and very very clean. The three specialty restaurants are wonderful but if I had to choose the best I would say the Bambu! Mayan comes in a close second and the Italian a very close third. Great presentation, flavor, choices, and fast service Staff - always friendly, fun, remembers your name, polite, nothing bad to say about these people. Always try to involve you in the activities but will leave you alone if you just dont want to join in. Evening shows - Very fun! One has to remember the performers are the same daytime staff you see around the pool doing the dance classes, aerobics, pool activities, darts, etc...They work very hard. They do lip-sync the shows, but they add their own touch, and put in alot of effort - BRAVO!! Grounds - very clean, green, and well-kept. Was a little scared when we first arrived in Playacar as there was alot of garbage in the entrance to the town, but once you got on the actual grounds of the resort there was not one piece of garbage to be seen. Very well kept. There was always someone trimming shrubs, tidying up plates or glasses left behind by guests, watering the gardens etc. Activities - sea kayaks, snorkeling, scuba, catamarans, parasailing, massages, shopping, internet, so much to do!!! Lots of choices to keep you busy if you get tired of just laying on the beach and soaking in the sun! CONS: Okay, every place will have a few things that could be improved. This place has a couple but this should in no way detract from how great of a place it is Rooms - had a very musty smell - and all my clothes had to be washed when I returned home. You get used to the smell when you are there, but sure can smell it once you leave and the odor remains on your clothes. Parasailing - the trip itself was PERFECT however we were supposed to get pictures that same evening by 6pm (as we were checking out at 7pm) and nobody every showed up with them. So that was disappointing. But we had not paid for them yet, so no loss other than we REALLY wanted those pictures Market - Once or twice a week, vendors come in to the resort and set up tables to sell items. These are VERY OVERPRICED!! One vendor tried to sell me a sculpture for $70 American, saying it was handcarved by his father out of cow bone. This very same sculpture can be found in Playa del Carmen for $14 - and is NOT made from cow bone. I bought two little flutes for $10 and later found them in town for $1 each. So buyer beware - if you want to shop - take a short walk or $5 cab into Playa del Carmen and buy in the actual stores (not the vendor shops) but the actual stores down by the beach. You will save ALOT! All in all the trip was wonderful and I WOULD return again. PS - If you are Canadian and want to take alcohol home, it CAN go on your carry-on luggage. I did not see one piece of carry one getting weighed - so this could save you ALOT of money in overweight luggage (we had to pay $70 extra because our alcohol and gifts weighed 7 kg extra!)", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cStaff, Rooms, Pool, Beach, and Food all Great!\u201d", "Author": "Jettyhound", "ReviewID": "UR11128221", "Content": "Just returned from this property after a nine night stay Nov. 16-25.

Their dancing was incredible!!!! The pool was \"so awesome\" according to my daughter. It was clean, not overly chlorinated, and refreshingly cool, but not cold. Water polo games in the afternoon were fantastic! After nine days, the buffet got a bit tiresome, but it seemed that there was always something new, and the other restaurants on the property were great. I can't say that all our wildest dreams were fulfilled...but that's not what we were looking for anyway. For the price, $197 per night for 2 nights then each third night free if booked with American Express (total of 6 nights paid for and 3 more free) this was a bargain!!! A couple of things to be careful of while in Playa Del Carmen: #1. Timeshare presentations...don't go to them unless you are sure you want to spend 3 or more hours (not 45 minute as we were told), and have no problem with being told you would get a free massage, then later get handed a certificate for $45 off a $90 massage). #2. Sleazy sales people who will try and sell you anything they can (including resin cast figures they try to pass off as cattle bone). All in all, I would highly recommend going to this property.

I commented to my wife while we were having our first drink that the decor around the pool bar area was a bit of a mess, as the paint was starting to peel off the walls. Decided to have an early night and see what the whole place looked like in the daylight. The next day things seemed a lot better. The walls I mentioned around the pool bar were being painted, which was a coincidence after what I'd said the previous evening. The service in the bars and restaurants was good, but as usual at these all inclusive hotels, there never seems to be an air conditioned bar, which is something that would be nice. The entertainment is not too good. The animation team do try very hard, but to advertise that they're doing Moulin Rouge in the theatre, then mime the entire thing, I felt was a bit disappointing. These 'miming' shows went on every night. There was also sometimes a singer/guitarist in the bar who was decent. Beach area is nice, but on our second week, the tide went out and seemed to drag half of the beach with it. You were left with a big shelf down to the sea. This isn't the hotel's fault of course, just something that remains from a bad hurricane they had a couple of years ago. Food was varied and I couldn't complain. We tried all of the A la carte restaurants and they were all excellent. I'd definitely recommend them all. Rooms were cleaned daily and the maids were excellent. A few points to remember - don't book your trips thru your rep or the hotel - they charge well over the odds. Walk or get a taxi (around \u00a32) to Walmart and there's a great tour desk in there who charge very fair prices. We'd definitely go to the azteca again as long as it were cheap - we paid \u00a3620 for 2 weeks per person.

The Azteca has beautiful grounds, spacious rooms and great service. Front desk was extremely helpful. We literally walked in off the street and they had us checked in and in our room in about 30 minutes. We got a room in front of the pool (24 hr pool bar) and beach. There are always plenty of beach and pool chairs. There is no swim up bar but you can also hang out at the Wyndham Maya (5 minute walk) and they have one there. You have to get your own drinks but someone does walk around on the beach periodically asking if you want drinks.

There are some sandbags but they are not horribly unsightly and the beach/water is beautiful. We tried the Italian, Mayan and Japanese restaurants as well as the buffet.

I can only say this hotel has improved significantly in the last 11 months. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves last year - even though perhaps not designed for singles/honeymooners with entertainment as can be family focussed and to some degree low level - pantos of cinderella and lion king etc). However, we got sucked into becoming a viva member, when we relaised we could take all our 3 children free every year until the age of 15 - otherwise as a standard family it would not pay you to). Anyway, despite enjoying the food (as i am a picky eater!!!), i have to say that they have made real efforts to improve all areas of the following: - more variety of food - ranging from fish/grils/caseroles/, pasta, omelettes, etc to hot dogs and pizza for kids. have stayed in a few all inclusives and this is by far the best for food - even though fruit variety is a little rare!!! - entertainment is better. Last year thesame programme ran from day to day 7 - then it repeated itself. This year they had changed (on our recommendation form last year) - and they now run a 14 day entertainment programme so you dont have ot watch the same thing twice. - accomodation is simple and basic - but clean and spacey. We liked it as it is small, and we were worried we may have lost our kids if it was any bigger - they had so much independance due to the design of the layout - that you could pretty much see them from one spot by the pool at all times!!! GREAT - very little effort required to keep an eye on 3 excited little ones!!!! - had ice cream machine this year - which wa snot there last year - had more healthy food choice options this year. - most of all - all salads and ice is done with bottled water!!!!! mainly why we returned with the children. - staff were great - as ever!!! - ample supplies of alcolhol - including some popular brands!!! And unlike last year - they did not run out of any alcohol - probably frightened i would create again!!!!! Maint hing to remember - is that whilst you may have to accept some minor complaints - such as waiting for a table or sun lounger - and complaint is taken very seriously.....and they will go out of their way to make things right!!!! AND APPOLOGISE!!! we had a room full of alchol last year after my complaint that they had run out of whisley 3 night in a row!!! and by sure they never did this time - at least 4 different types of whisley at each bar this year!!! The people are lovely, and so willing to help. You really cant ask for anything more!!!

Family of four, kids aged 8 and 12. Overall: we are very satisfied, no major disappointments. This is a nice hotel, despite what you may have read elsewhere. Keywords: simple, not too big, quiet, efficiently run, close to town. Staff: Very friendly and helpful. Discreet when you don't need them. Cleanliness: Excellent. Our room was made spotless every day while we were at the beach. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The pool area is wiped several times a day. Restaurants and buffets were impeccable. Rooms: We stayed in building 2 on the top floor (rooms 2300 to 2340). These rooms have a small balcony with a sliding door, cathedral ceiling, separate bathroom with 10-foot counter and sink, plus a separate bath and toilet with a door. Our room had 2 queen beds but others have a king, very comfortable. Tile floor, stuco walls with nice mexican colors and decoration, hanging closet with sliding door, shelves and 2 drawers. The rooms are equiped with an electronic combination safe (no key!) which you set yourself, cable TV, small fridge, iron with board. The AC was quiet and efficient. Food: Very good. We ate mostly at the buffet which was better than most we have seen elsewhere in the Carribean. \"International\" cuisine with mexican specialties. Limited choice of fruits (melon, banana, grapefruit, apple, papaya, pineapple). Veggies were varied and abundent. Food was well cooked and tasty. We eat early so we never had to wait to get a table on the outside terrace and got prime cuts. Beach: Hum... Most of the Riviera Maya's pristine beaches were severely damaged during a hurricane a few years ago, and the Azteca is no exception. Other hotels were either more lucky or have made a bigger effort, but the beach at this hotel is still about 3-4 feet below, and 50 to 75 feet shorter that before. The pictures you see on Google Earth and in the brochures show the beach as it was before, NOTas it is now. Still, the sand is pure white and the water is cristalline. Since all beaches are federal, you can easily walk up or down to find a better place to lie down on your towel. The hotel has and ample supply of chairs and we never had a problem finding two free ones for our family. Specials: The beach at the Viva Maya is bigger and better than at the Azteca, so as a guest of the Azteca you have full access to the Viva Maya (pool, restaurants, bars, chairs, everything except a room) and it takes about 5 minutes to walk there on the beach. On top of this, the Maya runs an hourly shuttle to the Coco Maya Beach Club in downtown Playa del Carmen, and you have free access to that too, including chairs, towels, showers and changing rooms at the Coco Maya Beach Club. On the way back, the shuttle will drop you off at the Azteca if you ask the driver, so you only need to walk once to get to the Maya (the shuttle doesn't stop at the Azteca on the way to Playa del Carmen). Excursions: We went to Xcaret and Tulum. Xcaret is a Mayan theme park with underground water caves and rivers, animals, a Mayan village and dozens of activities. Expensive but well worth it. The trip to Tulum takes 1 hour and it's pure magic. There is a nice pristine beach, incredible Mayan ruins and very knowledgeable guides (ours was a Ph.D. in archeology).", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham England", "Title": "\u201cHad a great time\u201d", "Author": "holidaymad71", "ReviewID": "UR8369302", "Content": "We have just returned from 2 weeks at the Viva Azteca and it was great.

We are both in our early 20's and enjoyed this resort very much. It is a small resort and has a nice mix of people from all over the world (not too heavy of a concentration of Americans! and a mix of families, couples, old, young, friends, etc.). It certainly exceeded our expectations! Here's what we thought: Location: The Azteca is located in the Playacar area of Playa del Carmen- a 20 minute walk or 5 minute taxi ride to 5th Avenue and a 5 minute walk to the Playacar shopping center. Very good location with easy access to downtown Playa del Carmen, Tulum, and any other areas you may want to visit. Restaurants: Buffet: Basic buffet with good food. Breakfast has an omelet/egg station where they will make omelets to order. Dinner has a pasta station where they will make pasta dishes to order. As a vegetarian, there was always something I could eat. Lots of fresh fruit at every meal as well as excellent breads and pastries. Guacamole is always available and it is really good! Also appeared to be kid friendly with pizza at dinner, pancakes at breakfast, cereal, etc. They also have fabulous ice cream. Not the hugest suggestion I have ever seen, but decent quality. There are 3 a la carte restaurants, of which we ate at two of them. We made reservations for them on the first morning we were there and had no problem getting reservations as we had flexibility with times: Il Palco (Italian restaurant): Largest menu offerings of the 3. Lots of choices for vegetarians. Very nice caprese salad and fettucini alfredo. Wine list- additional cost per bottle, but they have a house red and white for no cost. Quality of the house wine is better than at the buffet, though not exceptional. Bamboo (Asian food): Appetizer: choice of either vegetarian spring rolls (good!) or variety of sushi (my friend said it was very good). Main courses are of a wide variety including Japanese, Indian, and more. There is only one vegetarian option on the menu, but it was decent. My friend really enjoyed her entree. We both had the fried ice cream for desert which was amazing. There is also a Mayan restaurant that we did not try. You can also eat at the restaurants at the Viva Wyndham Maya (a 5 minute walk down the street). We ate at the Mexican restaurant there: Hacienda Don Diego (Mexican): Strawberry margaritas served with dinner- not that strong but good. We had both had fried cheese with mushrooms for an appetizer which was really good. The tortillas were fabulous. There are no veggie entrees on the menu, but they prepared the chicken enchiladas with cheese instead for me. They had a mole sauce on them which I wasn't crazy about, but by friend had the fajitas and really liked them. Good guacamole. Other food/drinks at the Azteca: There is also a lobby bar with nice seating and a 24 hour snack bar that has food out most of the time- pizza, pasta, rice, small salad bar, fruit, fries, hot dogs, etc. Pizza was good and the fruit was amazing. The snack bar is where you order your drinks while at the pool or beach (they do not have waiters at the pool/beach). Drinks are good and they have a self-serve soda dispenser as well as self-serve juices, water, etc. which was nice. The snack bar was nice when we couldn't pull ourselves away from the beach/pool. Pool: The Azteca has one large pool area. Though they just have one pool, since this is a small resort, it is plenty big for the number of guests there. It is never too crowded. The pool is divided into an area with volleyball net as well as a more shallow section. Very nice and the staff is there constantly keeping it clean. There is never a stray leaf or sand on the pool deck or in the water. Beautiful setting. Beach: The beach is lovely. Though there are some sand bags to maintain the sand near the water, they are not horrible looking and appear to be comparable to other resorts. Lots of chairs including many under little huts which is nice for some shade. Plenty of sun too. There is a \"sand bar\" (made of sand bags actually) a bit out into the water which is an easy swim. While out there we saw a lot of small yellow and black striped fish on our first day. Non-motorized water crafts are free to use- kayaks, small sail boats, snorkel gear, boogie boards, etc. They also have a few wave runners, but I believe these do cost extra, though we did not investigate them. Activities: The entertainment staff offers activities throughout the day that we saw, including stretching on the beach, volleyball, water aerobics, etc. We did not participate in any of these things, but the staff does a great job of going around, talking to guests, encouraging people to participate, welcoming you, etc. There is a kids club as well, though we don't know anything about it. Everyday they have someone bring out either a small monkey, parrots, etc. that you can pose with to have pictures taken while at the pool/beach. You can then order these pictures for $8USD (5x7) or $10USD (8x10). They also take pictures throughout the day, including doing little \"photo shoots\" of kids that I'm sure parents loved. Though I know they are trying to get you to purchase these, they are actually really awesome quality- we purchased ones with tropical birds and one of us in the pool. It's a nice keepsake. There are shows every night. We stopped by on our first night- a Michael Jackson show- which seemed fun. We also saw part of a \"Battle of the Sexes\" show at the Viva Maya when we were there for dinner. Not really our thing though they seemed like a lot of fun- appropriate for both families and adults. Check-in/out: This was perhaps the fastest check-in/out ever. We were greeted with a welcome drink and the bell boy gave us a little overview of the resort as he took us to our room. Room: Though the furnishings of the room are basic, they are certainly sufficient. Though we had requested 2 double beds, we got a 1 king. I'm sure they would have been willing to move us- the bell boy told us to please call the desk if anything in the room was not to our liking- but we chose to keep our room since it was a large corner room with BOTH a pool and beach view. Absolutely amazing! Small balcony- not big enough for chairs (some rooms did have bigger balconies), but with a view like that who cares! We were very pleased. There is a coffee maker in the room, fridge with water, beer, sodas, that is restocked daily, and a safe. You set your own code (instead of using a key) which we liked so we didn't need to keep a key with us. The bathroom is pretty small- not much counter space either so all of our toiletries were constantly smashed up and falling over. The water pressure in the shower is good though. ByRequest: After making the reservation on a hotel booking website, I joined the Wyndham ByRequest program through the Wyndham website. I called Wyndham to add the ByRequest number to my reservation and was told that you cannot add ByRequest/have the benefits if you do not book it through them. This was explicitly stated and I knew this ahead of time, but I thought I would give it a try :) I then called the resort to confirm my reservation and the person there was happy to add my ByRequest number! :) With the ByRequest, we had a bowl of fresh fruit and bottle of champagne in our room when we arrived as well as nice robes and slippers. With ByRequest you also get an hour of free internet, which we did not use. Other Services: There is a concierge in the lobby who was helpful with anything we needed and allowed us to use her phone to call to confirm a tour we had booked so we didn't need to use the room phone. They also have an employee in the lobby who has brochures for activities and tours and can help you book things though we had done this ahead of time. They also have an office on property where private tour operators have hours. We used this to confirm our airport transfers. There is a spa and they also have massages in little huts by the pool which looked nice. There is also a gym and a small business center- computer use is not included though. There are also bikes you can rent, though we ran out of time to do these things. Viva Wyndham Maya: Just a note from when we were there for dinner. We walked around a little to compare the two resorts. The Maya is a lot larger than the Azteca which I'm sure has pluses and cons. The pool area was very similar, though the Azteca's beach was nicer, in our opinion. The Maya seemed to be a little more \"happening,\" which we though we might have liked if we had been with a big group of friends, though there was also a lot more noise. Overall, this is a smaller resort that has very nice facilities and excellent staff. We really liked the Azteca and would definitely both recommend it to others and visit again!", "Date": "August 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cBest vacation of my life!\u201d", "Author": "TravelChickMontreal", "ReviewID": "UR8239013", "Content": "In May of this year, my friend and I took a much needed vacation to Playa del Carmen.

JUN 12-26 2007. This was the second time we stayed at this resort, and the third holiday we spent in Playa del Carmen. Our experience during our first stay in 1999 was very positive, but after having read a number of critical reviews prior to our departure for Mexico in june, we had doubts on wether or not it had been a mistake to book the Azteca. Let it be said right away: We found everything about the Azteca to be in perfect order, just like in 1999. The staff was obviously highly motivated and everyone we saw worked hard to make everything perfect while keeping a smile on their face. The food at the buffet restaurant, the drinks, the room, the guest service, the efficiency of the waiters was of a high to very high standard, and eventhough we were unfortunate to have an overly salted menu served at the Xul-Ha, the hotel's Mayan restaurant, this does not really deduct from the overall very positive opinion we had on the service and food. We found the food at The Italian restaurant, IL Palco, to be great, and it has a good wine list. Our hotel room was fine and the maid service was nothing short of superb. The beach was in a lot better shape than i had feared after having read some reviews on tripadvisor. The Azteca's only beach-related problem is that the hotels to its left and right do not appear to have a beach among their top priorities. This makes for a strange optical impression, and probably means increased wear and tear on Azteca's beach. We did find the music at the pool area to be too loud, however others may have a different view on this matter.

Here are my observations about Azteca Beach-It is very relaxing.The beach is as good as it gets down there from what I could gather. It was big enough for us, plenty of spots to lie down, water was as nice as advertised. If you look down the coast either direction, you will see that there is nothing as nice as the Azteca's, currently. The pool is also really good, centrally located. An overall nice setup with pool leading into the beach area. Resort- Well kept, clean, very open and airy which is nice. A few bugs around the walls outside our room, but no issues inside. Nice walkways, good setup. Rooms- Open, pretty big, showers worked great, mini-fridge stocked everyday. Good enough for me, I'm really only there to sleep. And very clean Bars/drinks- Pool bar is great, very attentive staff. Same with the interior bar. Beer is Sol I believe, not the greatest, but no better or worse than bud-light or miller-light. As far as alcohol, they will use the some pretty crappy stuff, but if your drinking rum-drinks just ask for the Bacardi. They have 3 types. If your drinking Tequila, they got Cuervo or El Jimador. Yeah its not Patron, but its better than the shady stuff they will try to give you if you dont ask. It's an OK pour, I know people on here said that it was watered down, not true. All you really need to do is ASK and they will take care of you. Tipping honestly didn't seem to matter. Staff- Very friendly, a little annoying at times, but you know they are just trying their best. Looked like they were really good with kids. They will ask you to participate in things, we would just day we were all set and they would move on. They got our drift after a few days. Other Guests- When we were there it was very European, but this was a positive for me. I don't go on vacation to make friends, I go to relax. If I'm in another country, I don' t really want to hear Americans yapping all around me. I've travelled a lot, and I've gathered that Europeans are just a more relaxed bunch. If you can handle men in speedos and techno pumping by the pool, you'll be all set... Food- The first day \" This is pretty good, we could eat most of our meals here. 2nd day \" Lets go out to dinner tonight.\" Its not bad, but kind of all tastes the same after a 2 days. Pretty salty, but nice fresh fruits and vegetables. Great guacamole and pico to eat with chips when your not in the mood for the other stuff. Good coffee, espresso, lattes at the pool bar. There was a lot of good food on 5th, so we splurged most dinners. (and sometimes tacos for lunch, Aca Los Tacos down the way on 5th, man they are good and cheap.) The Zoo, great cheap internet/sports bar near there. Great time, would go back to the Azteca, but knowing that I will be eating out a lot. STAY AWAY FROM COZUMEL, IT SMELLS AND IS STUCK IN 1989. That's were we got the food poisoning the last day after snorkeling. As for Airport transfers, contact my man Tello at Playa Transfers. He'll get right back to you and you'll be taken care of.

My boyfriend and I stayed there from April 25th to May 3rd and enjoyed every minute of it. Food: Fantastic! A very wide variety with something for everyone. The buffet was rather upscale as opposed to your typical buffet, and offered a different cuisine theme each night (Mexican, Tropical, International, Spanish, BBQ, Oriental, and Italian). The buffet itself was open-air - partially on the stone courtyard and partially inside the building. The resort also had three restaurants that required reservations. They were italian, mayan and asian. Their food was AMAZING and the service was extremely professional. Room: Clean and comfortable! We requested a garden view, but ended up staying in a room that had a view of both the garden AND the ocean. It was beautiful! The room had GREAT air conditioning (very nice to walk into after a long hot day!). We had a comfortable queen size bed, a small balcony, tv with english/mexican channels, and a two part bathroom. Housekeeping was always very thorough with their cleaning, and did not move your personal items around (having them moved around can be a bit nerving). *Only complaint about the room was the shower. Their pipe systems are not the most advanced, so sometimes we would get the odd blast of very hot/very cold water during our showers. Beach: Due to the hurricane, the beach is not in the same condition as advertised on the Viva Wyndam website. HOWEVER, they were in the process of rebuilding it (which is actually a very interesting process). The beach was still quite beautiful thanks to the beautiful colours of the ocean. Compared to the neighboring resorts, Azteca's beach was in the best condition. Straw umbrellas provided plentiful shade while laying on the comfortable reclining lawn beds. Many vacationers seem to find that they have to go to the beach early in the day to \"claim\" a lawn bed, but we never had a problem finding them when coming to the beach mid-morning. Staff: The staff were always very well groomed, dressed and willing to help you if you required any type of assistance. As there is always a language barrier with some people when visiting a foreign country, the staff were quite capable of getting by with their English. The front desk and guest services staff were both fluent in English. Guest services were very accomodating and made very sure that we were comfortable on our holiday. Tour services were informative and provided many different options for tours. The resort itself is located in a beautiful block of other resorts, and is very lovely to take a walk through. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to town (we never found the need to take a cab there). The town is rather touristy (as compared to a more rustic town like in Puerto Vallarta). It's main feature is \"5th Avenue\" - a long road with no cars that is lined with many shops and vendors. It is a block away from the beach. As a young student on the first holiday with my boyfriend, I found this resort to be a fantastic experience for the money I paid - I would definitely return :)", "Date": "May 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "prevost", "Title": "\u201cbest deal you can get for your money!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "mauroPrevost", "ReviewID": "UR7484582", "Content": "this was my best vacation in mexico!!

Overall we were very pleased. I was a little nervous regarding the beach but it was fine. The beach was smaller than we usually like and you weren't able to walk the beach but the water was beautiful. About half the days had a red flag and one day in particular the ocean was very rough. You did have to get up early if you wanted chairs by the pool or beach, but it didn't bother us as we are early risers. The rooms are basic but very clean. We found the beds to be comfortable (though we do have firm mattresses at home.) The staff is extremely hardworking and very pleasant. Most staff spoke some English. The staff at the Excursions desk and Guest Services and the front desk all spoke English well. Some waiters/maids the English was not as good but not a problem. One problem we had was we booked 2 oceanfront rooms and only got one. The other had a pool view. They could not/would not change the pool view room. It was still fine (the kids stayed there), but the balcony was too small, you could barely stand on it. The balcony for the ocean view had 2 chairs and a small table. Nice to have coffee watching the sun come up. They had 24 hour room service, which we only used for our morning coffee. The tv (not tht anyone's going for tv, but my husband had to stay in one day from too much sun) got several American channels. The food was okay, what I would expect for an all-inclusive. Everyone found something they liked. We did get reservations at all the specialty restaurants at least once, though we did hear people complaining about not getting any. We enjoyed the Bamboo restaurant the most. The Italian restaurant was just okay, as was the Mayan restaurant. The animacion staff worked vey hard. They had Spanish lessons every day, cooking demonstrations, ping pong tournaments, dance lessons, step aerobics, etc..The shows were okay. The stage is very small. We did not use the kids club as my kids found plenty to do without going there. Did not go down to the Maya but heard it is more lively. One mother said she was glad she was not there as the kids were a little crazy and she wouldn't feel comfortable letting her kids run around. I felt the Azteca was small enough that the kids could have their freedom but I felt safe with them being out of my line of vision. The kids loved it there. All of them met other kids to hang out with. My two boys and husband did the jet skis and loved it. My two older kids did the scuba demo and then signed up for diving with Scuba Caribe where they did two dives. They both really loved it and now want to get certified. (You have to be at least ten for that.) On Sunday we went to Xcaret. The kids did swim with the dolphins, which was excellent and worth the money. We've done the dolphins at Discovery Cove, and this was far superior in our opinion. They really spent a long time (nearly an hour) in the water with the dolphins. We all found Xcaret to be okay, aside from the dolphin swim. The park itself is not laid out that well (IMHO). We've done all the theme parks in Orlando and never had any trouble following maps, etc., but here it just didn't seem to have any rhyme or reason to it. The animal exhibits were really lacking. The night show was terrific, although my kids thought the musical part of it was a little long. It was a very long day and if I was doing it again I would go back to the resort for a couple of hours and then return. We also did the horseback riding on the beach. I thought this was not so good. It was a large group (about 28 people). There were three guides with the group, only one of which spoke English. I thought there were too many people on the ride. They tell you if your horse starts to lie down (at the beach) get out of his way because he is going to roll in the sand to cool off. This happened to two kids (who luckily were very quick and got out of the way.) The ocean ride was a bit lame (although my daughter loved the whole experience.) Some of the horses were hard to control. I was on a beginner horse and it bucked, kicked other horses and bit other horses. I would not do this excursion again. Overall, I would say this resort is good for families. The beach is beautiful, the people hardworking, and the resort is very clean.", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cFood a big dissapointment\u201d", "Author": "prtyrik", "ReviewID": "UR7392070", "Content": "we stayed at this resort from April 14th for 3days...We are seasoned travellers whom have stayed in various caribbean destinations with all inclusives at most...I have to say that food and drinks are by far the most important things when we travel to resorts...so lets start with the food...the buffet was terrible ..be it breakfast lunch or dinner ..some of the food was hardly recognizeable the juices were completely watered down ..the al a carte resturants were somewhat better but try to stay away from the italian resturant ...food not good..the asian food at bambu was actually good...we spent most of our meals away from the resort which meant we spent a great deal of money for things that were supposed to be pre paid...the alcoholic beverages had no liquor in them..i expected a margarita in mexico to be the best but it was so bad i had to resort to the beer on tap (im not a beer drinker)...the service was good most of the time...just problems at the front desk ..i asked about the departure tax from cun to the us and was told it was 25.00 usd (it was really 45.00) ...we were a party of six adults (no children) and found the resort only had one pool which was full of children ...and the beach (what was left of it) i just did not feel safe enough with the edge of a cliff only a few feet away...so we spent most of our time away from the resort including a trip by ferry to cozumel which was so rough that a vast majority of the passengers including my self became sea sick..(you kinda get the impression this happens alot since the attendants on board start handing out seasick bags as soon as you get on the ferry) ...next time we will go to jamaica", "Date": "April 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cBring your own food.\u201d", "Author": "dink_small_wood", "ReviewID": "UR7377783", "Content": "Food got boring (buffet) after 2 days and was not great.

(Ages 6 weeks - 65 from Canada, US, Ireland and England) The resort is generally fantastic. The Beach: The beach is great. Still has some sandbags to rebuild it which creates a big step down to the water from the area with the chairs and palapas. (Be careful, we had one guest break her ankle her first day there when she didn't know the sandbags were there in the dark) But overall it's beautiful. Lots of chairs, lots of palapas. Very clean and the water is fantastic. We had a great mix of wavy days and calm days. The Pool: Clean and a great place to relax. The super super shallow area is great for lounging around and keeping cool. The pool bar was the central point of the resort (at least for my friends and family). The snacks were pretty good (the ice cream, nacho cheese, pizza and hot dogs were favorites). The drinks are good - the favorites seemed to be the Brisas Marinas and the Mango Azteca. The rooms: See check-in below for people not getting the room they booked/paid for. But the rooms themselves I thought were pretty good. Not quite enough drawer space but clean, well maintained. The fridge was re-stocked daily, the towel creations were fun. We had a flood on our last night (think the AC leaked) and there were 5 maintenance people in our room within 3 minutes of me calling the front desk. The restaurants/food: I enjoyed the food. Yes, you can get a little bored after a week, but it was overall pretty good. The pancakes with vanilla sauce at breakfast were delicious, I became completely and totally addicted to the guacamole, and everybody seemed to love the pasta bar (never tried it myself, I was addicted to the guac). The desserts were a little tasteless, but that's pretty standard for all-inclusives, I find. I tried the Italian restaurant (La Scala/Il Palco), the Asian one (Bambu) and Viva Cafe (in town, you have to pay $10). They were all yummy, although I hear that booking them was a nightmare. The activities: I didn't make it to any shows, or participate in any activities (hey, it was my wedding week!). My aunt and dad did lots of the water aerobics and step aerobics and loved them. The animation staff were great. Really friendly and enthusiastic but not pushy like I've encountered at other all inclusives. The wedding: The wedding was absolutely fantastic. I had been quite nervous as the wedding planner seemed quite blase about a lot of the details when I was trying to plan it from Toronto. But it was on the beach, the setting was beautiful, the judge was very nice. The onlookers from the beach taking pictures was a little crazy and disconcerting (especially the one guest who pushed my sister the bridesmaid out of the way in order to get a better photo). We then had cocktails and appetizers on the beach which were delicious. The wedding photographer was great, I am absolutely thrilled with my photos. We had a reception at the Italian restaurant. The food was delicious and the dj was pretty good. The bad: The front desk service is abysmal! They have absolutely zero interest in helping you. Service is slow or non-existent. I think almost everybody had at least some problems checking in or checking out or booking transportation. If you're planning a wedding there make sure you keep written records of absolutely everything you discuss with anybody in terms of money. We had a huge hassle with deposits and now they're trying to charge us extra for things that were specifically discussed. Despite the front desk problems, I would highly recommend this resort for anybody except for people looking for a party resort. The disco shut down for lack of use and is now more of a games room, although the resort is close enough to Playa, which is a great little party town.", "Date": "April 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manalapan, NJ, USA", "Title": "\u201cThoroughly enjoyed our time\u201d", "Author": "carlew", "ReviewID": "UR7294673", "Content": "We booked our trip (4/2-7) for 5 nites last minute via Cheap Caribbean. The process was simply and they lived up to everything. Plus the local agent helped us book tours at a less expensive rate then the hotel agent. Prior to traveling we sent emails to Wyndham and the agent regarding a request for an Ocean view room, king bed, and upper floor. The Wyndham web site allowed us to join Wyndham byrequest, promising benefits that never appeared. Upon arrival (late-7:30PM) I showed the front desk our vouchers and requests. We were greeted promptly, courtiously, and helpful. But they would not honor our request on arrival. (our email responses indicated \"if available\"). We were offered a large ground floor room on the garden and told to come back at 1 PM the next day if we didn't like it. The room had a severe musty odor and because of the location we couldn't open the curtains without exposing all to the other guests. I went back to the front desk the next day but only after considerable discussion and a long walk to another unacceptible room, were they able to put us in an upper floor, kng bed room with a good view. This room was very nice. I asked if the ocean front rooms cost more to which I was told yes, but every travel site I checked only had 1 type of room. There is a money exchange next to the front desk if you need pesos or change of US currency-The front desk was not able to convert or change money. .....NOW THE GOOD NEWS..... The location is great, The food is plentiful, with a large choice. The Bamboo restaurant is the best. Make all yr dinner reservations at once. This process takes some time. The staff is terrific. Can't help you enough. We loved the oragami towel animals the room staff left us each day. The grounds are always kept clean-the foliage is beautiful. The nite time shows are excellent, especially Michael Jackson show. We liked the Azteca because it is more intimate (smaller) then its neighbors but it offers everything. The beach is a bit small but fine and the hotel was booked during our stay. Get out early to reserve your chairs. You can ask for a beach umbrella if the thached huts are in use. (Check the beach at other hotels--some of them do not have much of one since the '03 and '05 storms.) You can get to all parts of the hotel inside if it is raining. The snack bar/bar goes all day and nite with food constant. If you have children, it seems that the parents felt comfortable to let them roam the grounds. We felt totally safe walking off the grounds to town or for a nite time stroll. My wife and I are active 60 ( my wife just reminded me she is only 59) year olds who enjoy physical activities-skiing, biking, swimming, tennis, hiking, power walking and traveling. This was a restful holiday for us with a good amount of exercise. Don't miss Xel Ha-the water park. We were told to bring alot of $1 bills for tipping. We were told that the tips bring better service. Except for room staff, the extra tipping, while appreciated, didn't seem to have any effect.

March 25,2007\u201d", "Author": "laughbaby", "ReviewID": "UR7240131", "Content": "My boyfriend and I visited the Viva Azteca from March 18 - March 25. Notes on the room: When we booked our trip we asked for a king size bed none smoking. After we checked in and where given wrong directions to our room (resulting in us pulling our bags all over the hotel) we opened the door to a room with two queen size beds that smelled of smoke. My boyfriend called the desk and asked to be moved and requested the desk to send someone to get our bags at which they told us we had to go down there and bring our stuff ourselves. We where moved to a first floor room with two queen size beds but this room didn't smell like smoke so we stayed the rest of our trip in this room. TIP: You might want to try to call the hotel a few days before your trip to ask for the type of room you want. It seems that they assign the rooms ahead of time and if you don't call before you probably won't be able to be moved to a room you want the day you get there. If you can't get a room at the end of the hotel 2nd or 3rd floor that looks over the beach then a first floor room is nice because you can sit outside. FYI if you go to the 2nd or 3rd floor you will need to walk up stairs or ramps so if you have trouble with stairs you will want a first floor room. Pool and Beach Area: The pool was very nce and the beach was clean and larger than other hotel beaches in the same area. The water was AWESOME! We ate lunch every day at the pool and it was ok could have been better could have been worst. If you are looking for a place where you will have someone serving you at your beach chair then I am sorry this isn't the place for you because I only saw one person serving the pool and the beach (man she works hard but she is only one person). Truly the snack bar isn't far at all. Be careful about putting out your towels early because one day we did this and someone stole our towels and if you don't have a towel card when you check out it will cost you $20 a towel. Staff: The animation staff was very friendly and all of the cleaning staff says Hola when you pass by. The wait staff at the buffet was very nice and willing to get what ever you needed. Drinks: You will have to try really hard to get any type of buzz off drinks here, but honestly I heard the same thing from people who went to other hotels. Don't worry about getting frozen drinks or drinks with ice we did not get sick at all. Food: Honestly the food tasted all the same to me it just didn't seem to have much flavor could have been me because I had a bit of a cold. My boyfriend is a picky eater but he was able to find something he liked at each meal so don't worry about that. Unfortunately we are ice cream people and well the ice cream wasn't good at all and the buffet deserts where not good. We did try 3 restaurants the Italian one, Asian food, and the Viva Cafe down town. I would not go to the Viva Cafe again because it is $10 a person to eat here and truly the restaurants at the hotel are much better and you don't have to pay anything. The bread at the Italian restaurant with cheese in it was awesome and the food at the Asian restaurant was great. Tips for Making Reservations for Dinner: No need to wait in line after breakfast because you have until 1pm. What we did was relax the first full day . Then you just go up to the guest services around at noon when everyone else is having lunch and book all of your reservations for your stay right then. We had no problem getting a 6:30 slot for several nights. Clean: The hotel was very clean and someone was always walking around sweeping up. Almost every day the housekeeper made us a towel animal and never took the tip we left each day (we just left it all at the end). Overall: We had a nice time and we got what we paid for so if I couldn't afford a large bill I would go here again. However I would probably like to try another resort just to see what it is like. Tips for things to do: We went to Tulum and then Xel-Ha at a cost of about 120 dollars a person and this was an all day trip. Now that I did it I would not go again if I went back but it was good to see once. Bring water and a hat when going to Tulum it is HOT! Many thanks to Beto for being the best guide ever. Xel-Ha has snorkeling and all food is included but there are extras that cost 100 dollars and up a person. Don't do the dolphins at Xel-Ha because there is another place that is much better. We went to swim with the dolphins at dolphinus if you can only do this DO IT this was the highlight of our trip at 140 dollars a person. Be advised if you want pictures it will cost you $19 for each or a CD of 8 pics for $75 or the DVD video for $50 or all about 32 pics and DVD for $215. The pics are very nice but expensive.

The maid was really creative with making towel animals. There was beer, soft drinks and water in our mini bar fridge which were replaced everyday.

The pool is nice and the water is very clean with regular maintenance being done every morning. Beach: The beach is great, even thogh they lost a good portion of it a few months ago due to heavy wind and waves. Currently they are working hard at building up the beach, but it has been difficult due to wind and water errosion. There are plenty of shady spots, and lots of beach chairs for everyone. Yes, the premium spots get snatched up pretty quick, but there was always a place to sit down and get comfortable. Food: The food was great, we really enjoyed the buffet, and the Italian restaraunt. It was always fresh, breakfast was full Amercan or European, with pancakes, french toast, bacon, eggs any style, an omlette made to order if you like, cold cuts, fresh fruits etc. We had Mexican food one night which was great. Always something fresh being cooked like fresh fish, pork chops, steak etc. The pasta bar was also super, and again made fresh right in front of you. My son is 15 years old and a bit of a finiky eater, and he quite enjoyed the food. There was also a snack bar with pizza, hot dogs, burgers, fries, natchos&cheese etc. The food was never a disapointment. The drinks at the bar were very good, and the Pina Coladas were my wife's favorite. Activities: Always lots to do and get involved in, my wife and I enjoyed the dance lessons, my son liked all the pool stuff, like volleyball, and water games. To sum it all up we had a great time and for the money I would Highly recommend the Resort, you will not be disappointed if you are a person with reasonable expectations, this is not a five star resort, but it is worth every penny you will pay and then some. A special thanks to Alessandro Stifani and all the people that made us feel like we were at home with family!! Gracias por todo!!

The day we arrived it was about 90 degrees out and we had flown in from Canada that was frozen like a popsicle. we changed into our bathingsuits almost the instant we arrived. i my self (the daughter and youngest in the family) was hungry because all i had eaten was airplane food... so i went to check out what foods they had there for the guests. i was in heaven. They had pizza, fresh fruit that looked (and tasted) like it was straight from the tree, there was all sorts of delicious mexican and continental foods. the food every day was just a little more amazing then the last. then i went to go to the room... it had a beautiful view and was big enough so that the 4 people in my family could stay in it without feeling clostrophobic. Almost everyday of our 2week stay my mom and i would go to the arobic lesson w/ one of the animation staff, and then after that we would do the dance lessons, also taught by the animation staff. now usualy im not really one for arobics... but the people working at the resort made it so enjoyable. i also played a fair amount of tennis at the resort with the new Tennis coach who would act more like a really close friend, which i liked because i didnt know any people out there, but it was not hard to meet new people because it was just so friendly. The one thing i would not do again would be going to Xcaret, i was told by people that had been there befor that if u go to Xcaret u must stay for the show because it is amazing... i did not find the show to amazing plus the roof in which the show was under was leaking with the rain that had been falling for 10 min. i have no bad coments for Viva Azteca, the peope, the activities, the food, and the 24 hour bar all made it so hard to leave my best Vacation ever.

The food on those holidays was no different from every other night and was still buffet style. Everything they serve is distinctively NOT Mexican and is good for about 3 days before it all starts tasting the same... like salt.

The buffet food is OK, however, is basically the same everyday which gets old after 4th day. We went into Playa a couple of nights to eat dinner ( once a Yache's which has excellent Mayan & seafood ). The beach bar / buffet does not have much available for food as all I could find was dried out hamburgers and chips. The drinks are watered down although you can ask bartender(s) to step them up a bit. There was a lady who came by the beach occassionally to deliver drinks at your beach chair. We booked one night at one of the restaurants ( Mayan one ) which had good food & ambiance. Would recomend booking a day or two upon arrival as they can fill up. The wait to book the restaurants within the lobby can be 10 to 15 minutes in the morning. I would wait until afternoon to book as line is shorter or nonexistant. The rooms are typical, relatively small with hard beds. Frig is stocked daily with juices, beer and water at no charge. Ran out of hot water in shower one morning. There is a decent gym on site, money exchange service, gift shop, internet service (for a fee) and a good tour desk to arrange for local tours. Staff was very friendly for the most part. Plenty of beach chairs available, however, if you want poolside chairs, have to reserve one first thing in the morning. Water had that beautiful Carribean hue and was warm.

With some of the larger hotels you could be there all week and miss running into the people you came with.

They seemed surprised since they made it seem as though our room was the best they had... don't get me wrong.. the room was great, we just would of prefered a higher floor so we could use the patio and probably not have unwanted guest such as Geico's... haha.. but again... my personal opinion... the staff came right away when I called to get the geico out... we laughed cause I called it a lizard.

We had a fabulous time and this is a great resort for families. We had not one bad experience from check-in to check-out. The rooms, restaurants, bars and grounds were spotless with staff always cleaning. The rooms had all the amenities we needed. Irons, fridge with pop, water and beer - all free. Hair dryers, TV and even a clothesline in the bathroom. I'm a clean/germ freak and if you're like me you'll be glad to know that when they change the bedding at the beginning of your stay you get fresh blankets and bedspreads in addition to sheets! I know this because I saw them cleaning rooms and the blankets, sheets and bedspreads were in the dirty linen carts outside the room. The food is very good. My family is very picky and with the exception of my 11 yo we all found something to eat. My 11 yo existed heavily on the food from the pool bar - hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, pizza, chips and salsa, fruit and ice cream. Back to the buffet food, there was always eggs, bacon, pancakes, french toast, bread for toast, and cereal for breakfast. Didn't eat much at the buffet for lunch - ate at the pool bar. Dinner: there was always either steak, chicken, turkey, pork on any given night along with rice, potatoes, pizza, pasta, salad, and fresh bread. At each meal they also offered mexican food if you are so inclined. A tip for coffee lovers - pass on the buffet coffee and treat yourself to lattes and cappucinnos (sp?) at the pool bar (really early in the morning) or the lobby bar (around breakfast time). The cappucinnos are fabulous!!! Oh and one more tip - coconut ice cream at the buffet restaurant - to die for! The beach is sadly in a bad way after the ravages of recent hurricanes however, we spent many hours playing in the surf and riding the waves on the boogie boards. It was clean and well staffed. There is a fairly large area of sand with chairs and shade for beach lovers. The pool was great too - get up at 6 am if you want a pool chair - after breakfast is fine for a beach chair. I can't say enough good things about this resort. It's small so there are rarely line ups for food or drink. As well the animation/sport staff (one in the same) work very, very hard from 10 am to 11 pm plus. They really make sure everyone is having good time. The night life is almost non-existent except for the shows the animation staff puts on at 9:45 pm. The shows are hokey but damn these kids work hard at them - just how they can remember all the dance numbers simply amazed me. We didn' t go on any of the trips because they were expensive and when you multiple it times 4 most trips are over 400.00. We did take the ferry to Cozumel and went snorkelling at Corona Beach. Ferry cost us 80.00 US round trip for 4 people and Corona Beach was an 11 km taxi ride (10.00) and you don't have to pay to get in unlike other beaches we heard of. They do however expect you to buy their beer and food which is sort of pricey. We saw a wide variety of fish but the hurricanes have demolished most ot the coral so the ocean floor was pretty bleak. Snorkelling gear, if you don't bring your own, is 12.00 to rent. Lastly, I want to add that my expectations were low due in part to some of the reviews on this site but my expectations were exceeded by a long shot.

For the first week it was just our immediate family: myself, my husband (both in our early thirties), and our two children (ages 7 and 3). For the second week our extended family joined us: my in-laws (in their 60\u2019s) and my brother-in-law & his girlfriend (in their early 30\u2019s). We loved it! I took hundreds of pictures and will try to post a few. We booked our trip through www.selloffvacations.com and got a decent price. We did not try the kid\u2019s club or the babysitting so I cannot comment on those. The playground seemed to be broken and roped off, which was disappointing at first, but the kids just wanted to be at the beach and pool anyway. We did go look at the kids club at the Viva Maya and it looked very good, but we never tried it. Rooms: Our room was large, with two double beds, and very clean. We never did get any towel animals (we did leave tips every day), but that was no big deal. There was a TV, clock radio, hair dryer, safe, and fully stocked mini fridge (water, pop, beer) in the room. We always had lots of hot water in the shower. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was the balcony \u2013 it was very small, so small that there\u2019s no way a chair would fit out there. It would have been nice to have a usable balcony to enjoy after the kids were in bed. If this is important to you just request a ground floor room \u2013 they all had small patios with two lawn chairs each. I took several pictures of the room which I will try to post. Pool: The pool had three sections: one part was only a few inches deep, another part was a few feet deep, and the main part of the pool was about chest-height on an adult. Note that a child could easily go from the shallow parts of the pool to the deeper part \u2013 there is no separate kid\u2019s pool. Our children (ages 3 and 7) loved the pool! We brought a life jacket for our three-year-old and she loved being able to swim around in it. If your children are young, bring your own life jackets for them!!! One woman tried getting a life jacket for her child from the hotel, and it was a huge adult-sized jacket. We also brought some toys to use in the water. The pool is un-heated, but the cool water feels great on a hot day. There is a hot tub next to the pool, but the water is actually cold. Seemed weird, but there were often people in it. There are many activities around the pool such as dance lessons and volleyball \u2013 you can just choose to participate or not. When you check in you will receive cards to exchange each day for beach towels (there is a booth by the pool). I was worried that the towels would be small thin ones, but I was wrong \u2013 they were huge plush towels! Don\u2019t bother bringing your own towels, unless you plan to leave the resort. We never went to the pool until after lunch and there always seemed to be one chair available, which I would use while my husband and kids were in the water. Beach: The beach was wonderful! Our family loves the beach so this was really important to us. The beach has loads of powdery white sand, and the water is a beautiful shade of blue! About 30 to 40 feet out into the water there is a man-made reef (made from sandbags). You can stand on the sandbags and the water is a few feet deep over them. My husband and son enjoyed swimming out there to see all the fish on the other side. It is not an easy swim; so once again, bring lifejackets for your kids. We brought small shovels and buckets for the kids and they spent hours building sandcastles. Other posts have mentioned the topless women on the beach \u2013 yes there are a few, but it is no big deal. Although my husband mentioned it, my kids didn\u2019t even notice! A lot of people smoked on the beach, which I didn\u2019t appreciate. Canadians would never smoke while sitting in a beach chair next to a child! This didn\u2019t seem to be a consideration for Europeans though. I just chalked it up to cultural differences and moved my kids to a different chair. There seemed to be plenty of chairs available, but we were there before Christmas rush so the resort wasn\u2019t that busy. I brought a small beach chair with me and it was great. It was small and worked well to have down at the water so I could be close to the kids. I bought it from www.mec.ca (do a search for chairs; it was about $22 dollars). If you want shade there seemed to be beach umbrellas available in the little hut where one checked out the towels, but we never tried to get one. The hotels on either side of Viva Azteca have no beaches! Do not stay in those hotels! To the North there is a very fancy Riu resort. They have lots of sandy areas for chairs (a big retaining wall), but to get to the actual ocean there is a small rocky beach. I guess everything else was washed away in the hurricanes last year? The hotel to the South just had a big retaining wall, and no beach. We did go look at the Viva Maya, and their beach was small - not as good as the Azteca. It looked like most resorts South of the Maya had decent beaches. Buffet Food: The food at the hotel was actually quite good. I am a vegetarian (no meat, chicken, or seafood, but I do eat dairy) and quite picky, so for me to say the food was good is saying a lot. Last time we went to this part of Mexico we stayed at a different all-inclusive hotel and I was so sick of the food I stopped eating after 4 days. This time I was still enjoying the food after two weeks! There was a pasta bar that my kids and I loved. You have your choice of pasta, sauce (usually tomato, meat sauce, or a cream sauce), and pick your veggies, then they cook it up for you. It was wonderful, especially for my picky children. The rest of the buffet was quite good with lots of variety and the food was always hot and fresh. I did bring a small jar of peanut butter for my daughter, since she loves peanut butter sandwiches for lunch and they seemed to only have Nutella. There was milk available at breakfast, but for lunch and supper you had to just ask the waiters for it. Note: Be sure to ask for cold milk or they will bring you hot milk. Leche frio por favour (cold milk please). Drinks: The drinks were great. I had many Mango Aztecas every day and they were not watered down at all. The wine at the restaurants was OK too. Other Restaurants: There are three specialty restaurants at Viva Azteca that require reservations: Italian food, Bamboo (Asian food), and Mayan food. We tried all the restaurants, plus the Mexican food restaurant at Viva Maya. All were quite food, but the Italian restaurant was our favourite \u2013 we went there three times! To make the reservations you must go to the reservation desk in the lobby. I think they opened at 8:30 AM. There was a bit of a line-up some days. Once you get to the front of the line, just make all your reservations for your entire stay so that you are not waiting in line every day. They will let you do that for the Azteca restaurants. Getting into the restaurants at the Viva Maya resort is harder. They seemed to only take reservations for that night, and the next night and only seemed to have tables for two or four people. We only managed to get in to one restaurant at the Viva Maya. Italian Restaurant: We loved this restaurant. It was small and cosy with excellent service. We went there three times and I still dream about the food at night. It is quite a large meal: salad, pasta course, main (meat) course, and dessert. I skipped the meat course and was still totally full. My kids wanted plain pasta & break sticks, and they were more than happy to accommodate them. There are tables of all sizes, including two tables of 8 which worked well for our large group. Bamboo (Asian food): This restaurant also accommodated our large group of 8 people. We had our own chef who made all the food on a grill in front of us. There were stir-fried vegetables, beef, chicken, and shrimp. The meat was kept separate from the vegetables, which I appreciated! There was also bowls of fried rice, and dessert (deep-fried ice cream or fruit). The meal was very fun and entertaining for the kids, but even my meat-loving husband complained that there was too much meat. Other people in the restaurant, who were not seated by a grill, seemed to be ordering off a menu. It was a fun restaurant to try once. Mayan Food: This restaurant is located outside (no AC) and for some reason they refused to give us a reservation for 8 people and so we had to make it for two tables of four. When we got to the restaurant they did have us seated at one big table though, so I\u2019m not sure why the reservation person wouldn\u2019t allow it\u2026no big deal though. Our meal was a bit of a disaster! All the main courses had meat, so when I requested a vegetarian meal they insisted that they could only make pasta for me (not very Mayan!). My food was OK though, but not amazing. My husband has a nut allergy and was very careful to not order anything with nuts. He took one bite of his appetizer and had an allergic reaction. The waiter assured us that nothing had nuts in it, but he was definitely allergic to something! He took large quantities of allergy medication and watched the rest of us eat. The atmosphere was very nice though. Mexican food (at the Viva Maya Hotel): I love Mexican food so we really wanted to eat here. It took us a week of trying to get in though and we could only get a table for two. Half the restaurant was empty, but perhaps they didn\u2019t have enough waiters so limited the number of reservations? Our meal was quite good. They even made me vegetarian enchiladas by substituting beans and cheese for the meat \u2013 it did take some coaxing though! Shows: I was only able to go to two of the shows, since my kids go to bed pretty early. We went to Lion King and Moulin Rouge. My kids LOVED the Lion King, and as an adult it was OK (definitely not a professional performance, but entertaining for my kids). Basically it was the songs from the Disney movie that the costumed entertainment staff acted out and danced to. I really enjoyed Moulin Rouge \u2013 the costumes and dancing were actually quite good. My in-laws went many of the other nights and really enjoyed the Mexican dancing. Activities off the resort: We took a bus trip into Cancun one day. Basically the bus just took us to three shopping areas in Cancun. It was pretty good, but not enough time was given for the lunch stop (we had to eat fast). We hadn\u2019t shopped much by then so we didn\u2019t know if the prices were good or not. Later on I wished we had bought more since we found that the prices were very good, especially in the store the tour guide recommended at the flea market. We just booked this tour through the Sunquest agent at the hotel. My 7-year-old son and I went on a Mayan Encounter tour through www.alltournative.com. I booked the tour before we left home. In the morning we toured the ruins at Coba, and climbed the big pyramid there. To get to the large pyramid we took a bike-taxi from the main ruins, which was fun and definitely worth the money. It would have been hard to walk with a tired child to get to the pyramid, climb the pyramid, and then walk back to the gate in an hour. After Coba we went to a Mayan village where we went on a zip line over a lake, rappelled into an underground lake, called a cenote, where we floated around in tire tubes (wearing life jackets, the water was 70 meters deep), then hiked back through the jungle in pouring rain to have a Mayan lunch prepared by the women in the village. My son was a little nervous for the zip line and the rappelling, but he did fine. They even had children\u2019s life jackets. The tour was great, but it was a very long day (close to 12 hours). We found out after we arrived in Mexico that there is a shorter tour to Coba (booked through the Sunquest agent at the hotel), that we could have done with our three-year-old. If you have very young children I would suggest the shorter day. Overall it was a great tour though. I\u2019m glad I brought snacks for my son since we did not eat lunch until 3:30 that day! After our other relatives arrived we went on an all day bus tour to Chichen Itza. Once again, we booked it through the Sunquest agent at the hotel (I think about $90 US per person). It was good with loads of history and the lunch was great. The tour was about 12 hours from the time we left our hotel to the time we returned, but the huge bus was comfortable so it was alright, even with a three-year-old. Last time we were in this part of Mexico we didn\u2019t go to Chichen Itza (we went to Tulum instead) so I\u2019m glad we were able to go this time. Our tour guide was absolutely amazing. We went to Playa del Carmen several times to shop. It is an easy walk from the hotel. It took us about 10 minutes to walk without kids (walking fast), or 20 minutes to walk with them and a stroller. I couldn\u2019t believe how much that little town has changed in 5 years! We didn\u2019t buy too much except for some vanilla and a few blankets and T-shirts. One afternoon we took the ferry to Cozumel. We made the mistake of buying our return tickets when we bought our tickets to Cozumel. We didn\u2019t realize that there are two ferry lines with ferries at different times. We should have bought our tickets there, and then bought our return tickets once we were in Cozumel and knew what time we wanted to come back. We ended up staying in Cozumel an extra hour since our ticket was for the ferry that did not leave at the time we wanted. Oh well! We also went snorkelling, which we just booked through the snorkel shop on the hotel\u2019s beach. The cost for low season (before Dec. 20th) was $30/person, and after Dec. 20th was $45/person. We were taken on a jet ski out to the boat, and then the boat took us to a coral reef South of the hotel. A guide swam with us and pointed out a lot of interesting things. All life-jackets and equipment were provided. I\u2019m not sure if they had kid\u2019s life jackets since we didn\u2019t take our children snorkelling, they stayed with our other relatives. It was a great little snorkel trip for people like me who want to go out for a short trip. The whole trip took about two hours. One afternoon we went to the Viva Maya hotel and tried the archery range. My 7-year-old loved it. Unfortunately it had rained that day so I couldn\u2019t try their climbing wall or the trampoline. I think both the trampoline and climbing wall were for kids over 12 years old only. The Maya hotel is about a 10+ minute walk from the Azteca. Sorry for writing so much!

We had never stayed on the Caribbean side of Mexico before. Absolutely stunning views and tranquil setting. The Azteca is well situated with only a $5 taxi ride to Playa Del Carmen or Cozumel ferry or a 5 minute walk to a smaller mall closer to resort. Ocean was absolutely beautiful. Very rough surf for the entire time we were there so we were either yellow (caution) or red (avoid water) the entire time. Alot to do on the beach from Parasailing ($55 each), Banana Boat ($12 each) to numerous other free activities ie: catamaran, kayaking etc.,. We felt very safe with the company running these tours (Scuba Caribe). Very safety conscious and NOT pushy, The majority of travellers to this resort were European and mostly young families. Our teenagers (14 and 16) felt there was tons to do to keep them busy. They played ping pong, took part in the dance lessons, water polo and volleyball, etc., They also have pottery painting near the pool bar which kept my 14 year old daughter busy for 2 days. Costs are very reasonable and Manuel who runs the kiosk is very good with kids and goes out of his way to help them. A definite must do if your kids are creative. The hurricane really did alot of damage to the area beaches. The resort is doing it's best to rebuiltd the beach by sandbagging. I would guess a good 150 meters of beach disappeared. The 2 resorts on each side of Azteca had absolutely NO beach so it wasn't unusual to see frequent visitors from there looking for some sand and surf. - and a chair. When we first arrived we learned you need to get out early to secure a chair either at the pool or the beach. There's just no other way to get one. There's rocks near shore and there were a few kids with cut feet so I'd recommend water shoes. We were located on the 3rd floor not far froom the pool and were happy to see we were upgraded to Oceanview. Rooms are clean - as was the resort - dated but very servicable. Air conditioning in the room was cold the entire time. Couldn't figure out how to turn it off but wasn't a major issue at all after being out in the 30 degree weather all day! When we first went into our room we noticed the sliding glass door handle was broken. It was fixed within 15 mins of us asking! Only concern I had was we arrived back at our room on evening and noticed someone else's underwear hanging from our shower rod. I went to the front desk to voice my concerns and the response I got was they would talk to housekeeping. Never heard another word. Is that a concern for anyone else? Good grief! If you like to shower with a bar of soap - bring your own. There was only a decanter of shower gel in the shower and it didn't lather at all. Sink is located outside of bathroom with no soap whatsoever. Bars of soap not avail so bring your own. We sure missed it. Never had face cloths the entire week either. The food and al a carte restaurants. My biggest disappointment. Believe me I'm not picky so I didn't expect alot. Absolutely NO seafood other than fish. I was hoping for a lobster or crab night. No such luck. Breakfast's were all the same. Big on deep fried and pan fried everything. You won't go hungry but don't expect great food. Ice cream was excellent. We didn't have a problem booking the Italian Restaurant at all. Food was awful and I mean awful. Service was lousy but I don't blame our waiter. He was the only one for the entire restaurant. We only saw our waiter twice and that was to hand us the menu and take our order. Never got bread as everyone else did. Pasta was pasty - yuk - and the pork chops - which are my husband's absolute favorite - had no flavor and had clearly been sitting for a while. Worst meal we had there. We went over to the Viva Maya about 5 resorts down as we could use their facilities and spoke to people staying at Azteca but eating there. They felt the Maya food was much better. We didn't get the chance to find that out for ourselves however they did eat at the Maya Italian Restaurant the same night we ate at the Azteca Italian and I have to tell you. The food choices and service were superior. Over-all I would say based on location, and hotel it's definitely a 4 star. Food a 3 star... barely. We're going back to Playacar area in Nov/Dec for 2 weeks but I won't stay with Viva again and it's strictly because of the quality of food and lack of buffet variety. I can bring my own soap but I couldn't only eat there for 2 weeks.... p.s.. Took 2 tours while we were there. Captain Hook and Xel-Ha. We were not aware Captain Hook was in Cancun so a long ride (1 hr and 15 mins each way). A fun pirate adventure with duelling ships and kind of themed after Pirates of the Caribbean. Dinner and drinks included. They really pack you in these ships. Was it fun? Yes. Would we do it again? No. Too far to go. We didn't get back to the hotel until midnite. A long day for the kids - especially after spending the day at the beach in the sun. Xel-Ha was great and we'd definitely do it again. Aquatic based adventure with lots of snorkeling and things to do. Was our kids favorite spot of our trip. One of the attractions we took avantage of there was the Sea Trek ($45)where they put a dome type helmet over your head and you walk along the ocean floor and feed fish etc., My son has a stingray eating off of his helmet head. Absolutely loved it. Swimming with dolphins was just too expensive ($125).

I'll start by saying that I've travelled a lot and stayed at all-incusives in DR, Cuba, Florida, Jamaica, Bahamas, etc... and thought I should check out Mexico. We arrived 31 Dec 2006 and left on 07 Jan 2007. As for the reviewer who was charged extra for New Year's dinner, I can say that it did not happen to us at all so I'm not sure what that was about. Overall I would recommend DR or Cuba in a second over Mexico. Here's why... 1. Beach - this is what I really care about.....the beach at Viva is very disappointing. The sand is brown and has a lot of garbage (old cups, etc,,,) in it as it is not cleaned nearly as well as other resorts I've been to. There is also a lot of garbage floating in the murky water in the swimming area. The sand is not powdery like Cuba and there is a lot of rock in the water which you can't see due to the murkiness. Lastly, the beach is MUCH SMALLER than the pictures!!! There was a hurricane in 2005 which took away about 50 feet of beach and left the resorts on either side with no beach at all!! This caused another problem since the tourists from the resorts on both sides now come on to the Viva beach to use it and take the loungers and cabanas. Sometimes the staff will notice and ask them to leave which caused a couple of yelling matches from upset 'visitors'. Also, these resorts will not allow you onto their properties to pass to where you can walk for a little ways on the beach. Strange since their guests come here! As a result, our beach walks, which in DR were for miles along Bavaro, were about 20 metres from one side to the other. Overall the beach was the most dissappointing part of the resort - dirty, very small, lots of garbage in the sand and water - not worth it at all. 2. Food - probably as good as at any resort other than a Sandals I've been to. Lots of variety. Unfortunately, the 3 A La Cartes did need to be booked on your first day or they were full and we didn't get reservations until the end of the week because of this at very early or late times. We were at the front of the line and they told the lady after us that they had no spots left - she had just arrived that day!!! I think it's shameful to advertise 3 restaurants that you cannot get into. 3. Pool - not the biggest I've seen and no swim up bar. But, it was very nice, kept very clean and never seemed too crowded. 4. Rooms - reasonable (not as nice as Sandals but nicer than Cuba) and kept very clean - although the maids did not get around until about 3pm so don't expect clean towels too early. 5. Staff - animation staff were great - always friendly but not too pushy about getting you involved. Check in staff were great as well - our return flight was delayed by 8 hrs so they let us keep our room until 2pm (we were supposed to leave at 6am) for the day so we had an extra day by the pool :-) 6. Transfers - as with all Caribbean airports there were an abundance of pushy porters who I avoid but in Mexico one literally yanked the handle of my only roller-bag out of my hand after I had clearly declined his service and walked it 10metres to the bus and then demanded a tip - which I refused. He yelled at me in Spanish and our tour operator at the bus yelled back at him and apologized to me! Good for you Signature Tours!! 7. Flight - flew Sky Service out of Toronto - 1st time with tem - no complaints other than their headset jacks are a 2-pronged affair so you cannot use your own standard headsets from an IPod, etc.. and they wanted $5 for a set to hearthe movie. Kind of a scam since Westjet (love them!) has standard jacks or will sell you a headset for $1. Anyway, it was sunny every day and hot but the beach and filthy water was a huge disappointment. I'd recommend going to DR or Cuba over Mexico any day - I think it's cheaper as well.

Here is I have to say about this all-inclusive hotel. WAR !! I explain\u2026 Every morning you have to wake-up as early as 6:00 am to reserve a spot at the swimming pool or the beach (already 3/4 reserved at this time) by putting a towel on the beach chair. Then it\u2019s breakfast time with tables half ready. I mean by that, people are taking utensils from other table to complete their own table. That creates a huge mess every morning. Then, time to line-up to reserve an evening table in one of the 3 restaurants of the hotels (if it\u2019s not already all booked). We tried, for fun, the asian one\u2026 It\u2019s a joke and not good at all\u2026 Don\u2019t waste your time there. On top of that, I can\u2019t stop thinking that the picture is wrong: raw fish & sushi in a country where the average temp. is about 28 to 30 degrees celcius, it\u2019s a bit scary\u2026 Now when you\u2019re done with that you can finally rest on you chair and enjoy a very very busy swimming pool or what is left of the beach. Keep an eye on your towels; if you loose them, it will cost ya. The beach. Don\u2019t look at the pictures attached to this hotel, the beach has shrunk big time. Since the water came up dramatically after the storms, most of the hotel lost their beaches. The neighbors RUI & Occidental have none so a lot of their customers come and use the Azeteca\u2019s, so you can imagine the crowd! Sand is ok if people would stop using it as an ashtray! This is not the best hotel if you are looking for the perfect beach. Swimming pool. Small & crowded but nice for kids under 3. They have an area that is 3 inches deep. When the animation is doing a game, you don\u2019t have lots of room left to swim! Animation. Well, I would say they try hard to make you laugh but here is the problem: they also animate the show in the evenings so their hours are terribly long and they are very tired (according to what they say) so it\u2019s hard for them to keep up and stay on top. Their evening shows are homemade so don\u2019t expect high quality entertainment. They have a kid space where you can drop you kids from 9:30am \u2018till 5:30pm (when they are on time\u2026). The animation is mostly Italian and Mexican. Food. The food was ok, Euro style with touch of Mexican. Keep in mind that the hotel is own by Italians, Mexicans and German (I think). They try to vary every day on the 15 days turn around. If you stay more than 15 days you might eat the same food again. Breakfast was a bit boring after a while. Bars. Drink as much as you want, it\u2019s free. Rooms & Service. The service was ok but could be improved (even with the tips on the bed, it didn\u2019t help). Rooms are clean. AC is quite and works great. Beds are hard \u2018cause of the concrete bedding. Safe are free and worked good. No balcony unless you ask for a floor level room. Pay the extra for ocean view if you can afford, it\u2019s worth it. Hotel well setup for handicap people, ramps and so on. Tips. Want to save money, rent a car and go to the excursion by yourself, cheaper and the road are safe (beside those crazy bus drivers). Hotels will charge you a fortune for the excursions. Also be very early at Chechen Itza to beat the crowd and take a guide to understand better the Mayan culture. You won\u2019t be able to climb the big pyramid since they close it after a guy fell down and kill himself. To do the climbing go to Coba ruins. Word of advice Between the Azetca and the Maya, own by the same group and as per local people working there, the Azteca is the best. So we went to check it out. And yes, Azteca is the best. Best food, best setup for the bar / beach / swimming pool. The Maya is disgusting with water and sand everywhere around the bar, uneven floor around the swimming pool and the crowd. WOOAA, way too many people with no respect of others and their own vacation place. Well that\u2019s their problem\u2026 Overall. We enjoyed our stay.

All of them had an extremely high energy level on all days we were there even though most work more than 12 hours a day. The water sports staff was great, the activity staff kept everyone busy the whole day and the food staff was very friendly. - Water Sports - Unlike our exerience with other hotels that provide free water sports, The catamarans were always available and scuba and parasailing folks were present right on the hotel beach - Nightly shows - while some people would find them amateurish productions, we'd say that we had a blast watching these shows since all of them had the day staff working in them whom we had come to know. The night we were there - the productions ranged from Grease, moulin rouge, traditional mexican and disco. The dances by the staff were great and to do this with an energy level of broadway after a full day of work was incredible - Location - This hotel still has some beach left while the neighboring two properties (Riu and Allegro) had nothing left. Playacar is probably the best area to stay in Playa Del Carmen and downtown is only 5 minutes away by cab. Other aspects: - Food: Italian restaurant is very good. The buffet quality can be better but in a choice of 40-50 different items, most people would find something they like. The key thing to keep in mind is that it is mass produced food which you can have at anytime rather than spending two to three hours just driving around, trying to find a place to eat and hoping that the food would be good (which seldom is in tourist places) - Rooms - Were nice and better than what we expected for a three star property Overall, you would have a fun experience out of staying here besides finding it an incredible value. as a comparison, The last three days of our vacation we stayed at the Hilton in Cancun - which though has incredible ocean views and facilities - but had no sense of personal service, long lines for breakfast and it took 5-7 minutes just to get from the room to the pool area or beach.", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "..", "Title": "\u201cA very nice time\u201d", "Author": "drtraveller", "ReviewID": "UR6510846", "Content": "We just returned from the Azteca.

This was our second trip to the Vivas as we stayed at the Maya previously. The hotel is small but nice. Rooms are average but the housekeeping staff was very good and helpful.

If the buffet area would be closed off and air-conditiioned would help very much. The beach is small but nice and very well maintained. Biggest draw back with the beach is the areas of erosion and also lack of Palupas and chairs. People place towels on the chairs early in the morning to reserve and then are not there most of the day. Should be monitored by the staff and if someone is not using then move them. The theme nights are fun. The entertainment staff is not up to what we have experienced at other resorts. Also the theater was unbearably hot and needed some ventilation. The drinks are good but are watered down as are most all-inclusives. The bar staff was good.

We stayed there by having to book through a travel agent into a regular room when we have a membership!! We contacted the club office while there this time and they where completely unhelpful. Even went so far as to take us to the Maya to meet with a supervisor and then after not getting any help did not offer a ride back. Anyway lesson learned so my advice is to avoid altogether. The Riviera Maya area is beautifil. Highly recommend visiting Xel-Ha for a day and the ruins at Tulum. Over all the trip was just okay. Probably will not go back as there are other resorts we want to try - have geen going down there for last 8 years and there are now so many new resorts.", "Date": "November 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burnsville, MN", "Title": "\u201cwonderful intimate hotel\u201d", "Author": "Tibbs5855", "ReviewID": "UR6093339", "Content": "After a lot of ready of reviews on this website, I chose this hotel. I was already a Wyndham by Request member and it paid off. I partly chose the hotel because I was able to book an ocean view room. Being able to sit out on a balcony and watch the ocean is very important to me. We had one of the best rooms, closest to the ocean. As Wyndham by Request members my husband and I received premium beer on arrival along with a cheese and cracker tray. We liked the small size of the hotel and that in 5 minutes you could walk down the beach to Viva Wyndham Maya and partake in beverages and food there. I had a great time trying all the different drinks on the bar's menu. The beach was uncrowded and beautiful. We went from a Thurs. to Mon. and are going back again in April 2007 from a Thurs. to Tues. It is true that a lot of Italians and Germans vacation here and we found them to be fun to watch, especially when we sat on our balcony and watched them play bocce ball. The staff is great! The only average things were the buffet food and the air conditioning in our room. Next time we will try out the ala carte restaurants at both Viva's. We did do the upgrade and ate at the Italian restaurant in Playa del Carmen and like other reviews it was fantastic. The only trip we did was to Xel-ha and it was wonderful.

The main attraction of the hotel is it's staff particularly the Animation team, Alan, Annalisa etc. who work all day long to keep guests entertained but are not so intrusive that they spoil your holiday. The evening entertainment is so bad that it is good...we laughed along with the entertainers on quite a few nights!!!! The location of the hotel is within a twenty min. walk of Playa Del Carmen which is great for a change of scenery for both shopping and a livlier night out.

You can get food and drink 24/7. If you want to go into town, Playa Del Carmen is only a 20 minute stroll away and has a strip of shops, restaurants and bars (Senoir Frogs - brilliantly fun!) There is also a restaurant there called Viva Cafe which is included in your all inclusive stay but just have to pay $10 supplement - i highly reccommend it. The staff are the best staff I've ever met! Always try to include everybody. They do dance lessons in the pool, volleyball. My partner played beach football with the staff - the staff losing 3-0 and took it quite bad :-) They also did shows everynight which were very entertaining. They all spoke 4-5 languages and worked all day, which is so good. Our favourite was Giovanni, so entertaining and hilarious! I have'nt got a bad thing to say about this hotel.

There was a lot of kids at the resort and we found the European's did not watch their kids so it was annoying around the poolside with kids yelling, screaming and kicking balls around, etc. The Entertainment shows were not the best I've seen but they do entertain. They also have some theme nights and bring in street vendors to sell inside the resort. Be sure to book your restaurant reservations first thing in the morning to get a decent time.

The hype team were hilarious. They tried so hard to involve everyone. We especially liked Giovanni, he was so funny. There were always activities going on... bingo, bocce, volleyball, darts, dance lessons, etc. The shows they put on at night are great too. Decent dance numbers but plenty of entertainment. The drinks: There were many options to drink, I especially liked the Viva Azteca and Melon Bowl. There was plenty of alcohol in each drink, rarely watered down (only during the day they seemed to be). I did not particularly like the beer, they only served Dos Equis. I did notice that NO ONE tips. We started off tipping regularly, but the entire stay I never saw one person tip, so we eased up a bit towads the end.

The rest of guests included several more Canadians, few UK tourists, 2 (two) US guests. - With so many Italian guests, food and other areas seem to be targeted towards them, so we, English-speaking guests at times felt like outsiders. I'm not sure if I heard more Spanish speech around or Italian. - Drinks are awful. Beer they serve represents only slight resemblance to a beer. Cocktails are watered down. Red wine they serve at the buffet and at the restaurants is almost undrinkable (I'm not a wine snob). - Food at the a la carte restaurants, while served nicely, is quite basic.

The sports staff also did a great job. I noticed someone complaining that the sports staff just sat there all day...they don't. They give catamaran and windsurfing lessons at certain times each day. After the lessons, they spend their time renting out equipment and then SUPERVISING you on it. That means, if you get stuck out in the middle of the ocean or tip over, you can count on the staff coming out on a jet ski to save you. So yeah they don't just sit there doing nothing. They all work VERY hard. The waiters were excellent. Never in my life have I had waiters pull out chairs for me or place napkins on my lap. It was actually a little weird at first. Even in the buffet area, they were constantly asking if I wanted a margarita or anything to drink. Just always on top of things. The bartenders were also very friendly. We left the maid only about a dollar or two a day, and we always had our room SPOTLESS, and beds turned down and everything. Even if you don't tip them, they keep your fridge stocked, and beds clean.

Make your travel arrangements from the airport to your hotel in advance and part of your trip. I did not do this and we paid a pretty penny since this resort is about 1 hour from the airport. 2. Make your dinner arrangements at the Azteca not the sister resort Maya. It is very nice but they can not make them in advance for you. 3. Consider renting a car and go out on your own. Seems to be a pretty easy place to navigate around. 4. Plan to get stressed out at the airport. If you plan to arrive or leave on a Monday or Friday these are the busiest times. 5. Learn a little spanish. We were expecting much more english and they do try. But we are in their country and it would be respectful to them to be able to make communication easier. 6. Take a few dance lessons. The salsa looks like a blast. The resort does offer both spanish lessons and salsa. We did not have time to take them but it would be a good idea. 7. If you get to the beach early in the morning you can claim a great spot for the day. People are very respectful of your items and you can come and go with no worries.

The breakfast and lunch buffets were well stocked with a wide selection of food. The dinner buffet was also excellent or there was a choice of seven restaurants (three at the hotel, three at the sister hotel five minutes walk away and one in town, 30 mins walk or $5 in a taxi - the restaurant in town had a $10p.p. surcharge but was well worth a visit). The hotel bars were also good - always offering a wide selection of drinks and cocktails - the lists available at the bars didn't list many popular cocktails, but the barstaff would make them on request. The only real complaint I had about this hotel was the watersports; the staff seemed to see it as their responsibility to guard the equpiment from use by guests. They always seemed to find some reason why the catamarans or windsurfers could not be used. Often because lessons were first needed but they refused to provide these lessons except at very limited times despite the fact that they spent most of their day sitting under an umbrella doing nothing.

The hotel is about an hour away from the airport. We arrived and were checked in within about 30 minutes or so. The Hotel was beautiful. The grounds were kept in immaculate condition. The pool and the surrounding area was kept clean and tidy and water from the pool was constantly swept away to avoid slippery patches.

The staff in general were fantastic. I was very impressed with the kids club. Carlos was absolutely brilliant with the kids.

Food. I agree that the buffet is similar most nights but I am an extremely fussy eater and managed to find something of interest every time we went to the buffet. The specialty restaurants are excellent and it is worthwhile eating at the sister hotel restaurants. The snacks at the pool bar were just what you needed i.e. salad, fruit and fast food. Entertainment. Superb. The team were so motivated and if you were unlike us i.e. just happy to laze about during the day, there is plenty to keep you going. Volleyball, darts, aerobics, football etc. At night, you could see the amount of work that the staff put into the shows - some of the best I have seen. Just a shame so little people stayed up for the shows but we were always tired at night so you can almost forgive them!! Rooms. Clean and spacious - all you need. For the ladies, the hairdryer is very powerful so do not bother taking your own to save on your baggage allowance! Things to do. We would highly recommend Xel Ha - perfect for all ages. We also went to Xcaret. The show was good but slightly disappointed with the wildlife etc - the brochures were a bit over glossy! The jungle tour is good as well. General. We heard a few people complaining about certain things over our time in the holiday which really annoyed us. If you want five stars - pay for five stars. This hotel is extremely good value for money. I have been to the Caribbean a few times and it is always sensible to take one star from the overall rating. The staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel has all you need. We were a bit taken aback with the lounger situation though. We thought holiday was about relaxing!! If you are not down by 6.30am you will struggle to get a lounger in the shade. The towel place did not open until 8am and it became ridiculous when people were putting down their bath towels - this should be something for the hotel to consider going forward. As has been said previously, there is ALOT of Italians at this hotel. I have travelled throughout the world meetig many Nationalities but I could not believe how rude the majority of the Italians were. I am an easy going Scottish man and my blood was boiling on several occasions being skipped and bumped in to, and the way they treated the staff was appalling. Sorry to be slightly negative as all in all we had a great time. Resort is perfect but as I said, if you want five stars, pay for it. The Azteca is a reasonably priced hotel with all your needs and we would definitely recommend it to young couples like ourselves wanting a relaxed holiday in fantastic weather conditions.", "Date": "July 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "natjennings@hotmail.com", "Title": "\u201cFun at the Azteca\u201d", "Author": "Natjennings", "ReviewID": "UR5428401", "Content": "We had alot of fun at the Azteca. Good things: Amazing Beach-warmest water I have swam in. We tried the kayaks and the cateramans. It was a great time. Clean- The rooms were clean. The whole establishment was clean. People always working. Pool-Was warm and clean and has alot of activites to do. Food- For the most part was good. The Italian place was not so good. My son enjoyed the Japanese one. My only two complaints are 1- Expect to be at a place where only a few people speak English. They are many Italians that vacation there. The languages spoke are Italian and Spanish for the most part. 2- If you don't go out in the morning and lay down a towel, you will not get a seat at the pool or the ocean. There are many chairs vacant with people that put towels down but don't use the chair. There has to be a better way to do this. Places to go: We rented a car and went on our own. It is cheaper and more flexible. We rented a car for $116 dollars for the week. My family likes to snorkel so we went places where we could do this. 1-We went to Ya Ku Lagoon- Close to Akumal Beach. It was really great snorkeling. It is 7 dollars to snorkel for the day. 2- Half Moon Bay- Close to Akumal Beach- It was neat place to snorkel- Free- Lots of coral in the ocean-not so many fish. Many pieces of coral on the beach to take home if you like. We were the only ones there. If you go, go in on the right side where the waves aren't breaking. 3.-Corona Beach-Cozumel- Our favorite place to go. It is to the left once you get off the ferry. It is about 2 miles. You will see so many different fish and shells you will lose count. We took our car on the ferry. It cost $32 each way and 4 dollars for each person. The driver is free and kids are free. It is cheaper to do this if you have rented a car. It takes about an hour on the car ferry to get there. The beach cost $10 dollars and to use a table, you just have to order drinks or food. The food is good! We brought our snorkel gear we bought at a sporting good store. It is alot cheaper. To rent gear, some places charge up to $50.00 a person. Shopping- Playa De Carman and Cozumel both have lots of shops. Be ready for them to attack you to come in their shop and make an offer. The shops in front of the Maya which are walking distance have the same stuff and they are not as pushy. I liked to shop there.

Beds are fine, ac worked well, nice room safe. Typical hotel sized room with 2 queen beds. Not much on the television, but who cares, who needs tv on vacation! Beach- Beautiful water (amazing) beach is a little beat up from the hurricane . .but still very nice, you can walk the beach for a couple of miles, water color is stunning, water is clean, warm, simply perfect. Pool- nice but why hang at the pool when you have the ocean?!!! Food- Good, not great, omelletes for breakfast are awesome, green chili sauce was great. Overall no complaints, The Portofino at the Maya was really good (mahi mahi . .yummy!) I stayed away from the mystery meat, but the fish was good, pasta bar was very good, plenty to choose from, ice cream was good! Drinks (alcoholic)- Awful, and I do mean awful. If you are looking for a resort with delicious frozen drinks (i.e. margaritas, daiquiris, ect) I would avoid this resort like the plague. Not sure why, but the drinks were so bad, and I mean really bad. Tequila is watered down (no joke), no flavor to any of the alocoholic drinks, they actually all taste the same. Drinks at the Azteca are much better (weird!). Best bet is to go into playa del carmen and get margaritas at happy hour (2 for 1)!! I can not emphasize enough how bad the mixed drinks are at this resort. Beer is excellent, so if that's your thing, no worries, its cold, plentiful and delicious. Tips: rent a car, drive the speed limit (policia will pull you over if you speed and shake you down for $100US or whatever they can scare out of you). Xel-Ha all inclusive is a must. If you do any trip, do Xel-ha get there early and spend the day, make sure you do all inclusive, it is so worth it. Food their is excellent, beautiful trails in the jungle, amazing snorkeling, I can't say enough about Xel-Ha. Tulum is neat, very touristy. If ruins are your thing, go to Coba (1.5hr drive) and get there early to beat the tour groups! Misc. Europeans are very rude people, shockingly rude, they are not courteous at all, they will try to cut you in line and if you encounter a group of them on the sidewalk, they refuse to move to one side, so you basically have to give way or walk right through them. I did the courteous thing and moved to one side, they wouldn't . .so you just have to walk right into them and push them out of your way, or get off the sidewalk . .I suggest walking into them, strange but true. This happened mulltiple times, why people are so rude when on vacation is beyond me. Summary - Clean, nice rooms, beautful ocean, nice beach, decent food, horrible drinks.

The hotel as previously reported is not as grand as others in this resort but this does not mean that the staff do not offer the same high standards. The hotel itself is very comfortable and welcoming our room was cleaned immaculately every day and we too had a smile at the figures made from the towels by the cleaner. All the staff were very polite and the entertainment staff extremely motivated. Some hotels can be very remote but this one is situated perfectly nestling between the others on the main strip in Playacar with its own small beach. Playacar is a beautiful resort and we have no regrets at not staying in Cancun and if returning would stay here again. So many things to do you couldn't be bored whether it be going on an organised trip or doing the hotel activities or something on the beach. Shopping is great and we spent a fortune!! Trips not to miss - You must go on the Captain Hook Boat trip in the evening - a must - best night we had such a laugh and food and drink were great. Other trips and activities we did were - swimming with dolphins/manatees and sealions at Dolphin Discovery, Tulum and Xel-Ha, Horseriding, Parascending and out on a catamaran. In between all that and the shopping we also indulged in some relaxation - 1hr massage, manicure and pedicure which were lovely. (We did this in Playa del Carmen - much cheaper $35 for massage.) Playa del Carmen is 5mins in a taxi which costs $5. I would agree with some comments made regarding the buffet, the food is very similar every day and in line with what you would be offered in the Med - salad, pasta, rice, fish, beef, pork etc but both my friend and I are fussy eaters and we had plenty of choice to keep us nourished for 2 weeks. Lunch and dinner offer roughly the same choices so you can have a main meal at both times if you wish. The pool bar offers snacks all day and cocktails of course! We only ate at the a la carte restaurant (Italian) once but didn't really like it. The all inclusive package is perfect and means you don't have to carry money with you around the pool etc and can eat and drink whenever. I can't say enough good things about this holiday it was magical. For the very reasonable price paid for this hotel it was extemely good value and I would return tomorrow! This resort is perfect for couples and families and these are predominantly the guests at the Azteca as it offers a very safe and fun filled environment.

Rooms: This time- room was okay...first floor room with not a great view- view of a fence and side another building....but then again how much time do you really spend in the room....bathroom okay- sink and bathtub kind of shotty. Not totally dirty but not spotless either. Kind of stingy with the towels unless you requested they only gave you one towel and one hand towel...hello what about wash towels????? When visited back in 2001- we had a great room- 3rd floor with beach view- spotless, great maid service.....\"towel art\" etc. Grounds- still kept up pretty nicely. Workers usally doing something daily to the grass, flowers etc. Food- This time ok as well as last time besides my \"bug story.\" Ate at both restaurants- La Scala was good-alot of food and good service. The chinese/japanese rest. ( think the name is Bamboo) Thought this was going to be great hearing from other guests etc. It was great until I noticed an army of ants/ smalll type bugs on our table ......alive crawling!!! Totally could not finish meal and left in a hurry. This gave me a bad impression of this restaurant. When we told the waiter and showed him he said - oh they are from the rain and acted like no big deal. They should have offered to move us to another table in my opinion but they didn't. They kind of laughed at the situation.... kind of gross if you ask me.....I understand it is tropical in mexico and there are bugs there but right on our table??? UGH!!!! Power went out one night- supposedly throughout the whole peninsula...cancun...playa..etc. The hotel next door to us seemed to have a backup generator or something because it was all lit up....our hotel- not so- totally dark- a few emergency lights in the hallways but rooms totally dark. I mean this is Wyndham- you would think they would have a back up generator??? Took 4 hrs for the power to return. Staff- This time okay- not as friendly as before this hotel was turned into a Wyndham. Bar service good if you gave them tips..... Overall a decent hotel to stay at if you arent' looking for luxury. Just liked it more the first time we visited. Not sure if it's due to Wyndham taking over or just because this was our 2nd time there and expected more....

Although both the Italian and the asian restaurant, are definitely nothing to write home about. Unfortunately, I'm suffering some gastroenteritis from the sushi at the asian place ( I would definitely avoid it). 2. Beach- As many reviewers do mention, the cabanas get reserved very early (6-6:30am) and without it, it gets very very hot. In addition, with the small beachfront, even with a cabana reserved, you ultimately have another couple, 2 inches away from your beach chair, attempting to salvage some shade from your cabana.

I very much liked the size of the resort, and if you're fortunate enough to get a room close to the pool/bar/restaurant area (as we were), it is a very convenient layout. The staff is friendly and available to answer any questions. The animation staff was entertaining and somewhat attentive, particularly if you happen to be a young and attractive girl. The teenage boys receive no attention, as the ladies working on animation are basically assigned to babysit the numerous young children at the resort. The food was lacking in quantity and flavor. If you finally find an item you like, either at the buffet or the bar snack area, grab it while you can because once it was gone, it will not be replenished. They were constantly out of soft drinks, and would take a long time to refill the drinks. If you enjoy desserts, you will most certainly be disappointed in their variety and flavor. The beach was fabulous, and the staff working on the beach was a lot of fun. Do not take the snorkeling tour offered by the service on the beach. Once you finally get started on your tour, they take you on a 30-minute very rough ride to a rocky area with large waves, and attract the few fish you do see with fish food. The waves will most certainly push you into some of the large rocks (which they call coral), and you will end up looking forward to returning to the boat. Pay the extra money and ferry over to Cozumel to snorkel. They offer much better snorkeling options. I would not stay at this resort again. I believe I would avoid all-inclusives in the future. Although the resort offers some conveniences, I do not think the value is there. I think I would opt for a nice hotel/motel with access to the beach, and spend my money enjoying more variety of restaurants and activities.", "Date": "April 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesapeake, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAzteca was GREAT!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4983832", "Content": "Just returned from a week at Wyndham Azteca and it was everything we expected and more! 2 adults and 3 kids (16, 14, and 12). We used the Wyndham Vacations to set up the entire trip. It was very easy and the Wyndham reps were terrific. Also used the Hola Tours to get from the airport to the hotel. A little expensive but worth it since they met us with a sign at the airport, handled all bags, and the driver gave a great verbal tour as we drove. Total time was about 45 minutes. (Set it up through the hotel before we left the U.S.) Check-in was very easy. Thoughts about language problems were wasted. Everyone spoke english and were evn very patient with our halting Spanish. Room was poolside and comfortable. Only problem was had to ask everyday for hand towels. Also set up a few tours through the hotel website. Did the Tulum Mayan tour with the Xelha water park. Absolutely fantastic. Tour guide was terrific and very helpful. Xelha was amazing. Snorkeling, cave swimming, all just great. Set up tours through the hotel once there and went horseback riding on the beach as well as took a ATV excursion with Discovery Jungle Park - that was super. Food and drink were very good and plentiful. The BAMBU restaurant was great. Need reservations for this but they were easy to get through the Guest Services in teh lobby. Guest services ladies were extremely helpful. Beach although smaller than before Wilma was still fine. No problem with drinking the water in the hotel and even on teh excursions. Purified water was availble everywhere and served at all of the resort places we went. Took local taxi into Playacar and downtown Playa Del Carmen and it was easy. The drivers were very nice and every driver we had was honest and helpful. Even went to downtown Walmart to buy sneakers-a fun adventure. Took the ferry over to Cozumel ($10 USD each way). Shopping and sightseeing was very good. Hotel had tons of activities seemingly non-stop throughout the day and into the evening. Kids had absolutely no problem finding new friends and keeping busy - we all felt very secure here and had no problem letting the kids go off on their own on the property. A great overall vacation.

I was a bit nervous the couple of weeks before we arrived as I booked the Viva Azteca on line. I read all of the reviews which were mixed, and examined the photos. But you never know for sure until you get there, and my wife is pretty choosy and won't hesitate to let me know if she doesn't like a place. I booked it because it was priced appropriately and appeared to have enough going for it. I made the right choice. When we drove up, the grounds were nice, clean, and green. The lobby was well done, and, best of all, the desk staff was super courteous and efficient. They accommodated us well with 2 connected rooms and the rooms were fine. Fairly new, clean, a bit austere, but roomy, and well air conditioned. The grounds/landscaping overall were well done. The pool was great and well used. With organized (and unorganized) volleyball throughout the day we 4 \"boys\" could have a good time anytime. The beach area was better than I had set myself up to expect. Sure, the hurricane took its toll, but they have been rebuilding daily. Call me anal, but I stepped it off: 100 feet of upper beach depth from the walled pool area to the 4' drop off. From there it was another 65' (tide notwithstanding) to the water. I walked several other nearby beaches and ours was the deepest. It was fine. Big bonus for us: the waves were just enough to pick up and briefly ride via belly or belly-board (which the hotel checks out to you gratis). We spent hours just riding the waves. There is a lot of shade, but as all of the other write-ins have noted, if you want the big shade of a palapa, you better mark your territory before 7 am. Otherwise the shade is mixed as there are a lot of palm trees (sub-tip: If you miss the palapas, park right behind them as the shade will be there for ya). Plenty of other things to do on the beach/pool: free kayaks, free hobie cats, lots of organized events such as water polo, darts, stunt games, aerobics, dance, ping pong, etc. Parasailing for a charge, as well as banana boating, jet skiing, and snorkel excursions (our main events). The music at the pool wasn't so loud as with other resorts. This was a relief as we wanted peace and quiet. This brings me to the staff, a pleasant surprise for us. I hadn't seen any reviews about the quality of the staff. It was terrific. Most of the activities people were from Italy, Canada, Germany, of course Mexico, and elsewhere. They were very professional, outgoing, and friendly. And they worked their tails off, finally finishing the day late at night managing and performing in the theatre area. The food was fine. My wife loved it. Lots of variety. We ate elsewhere a couple of times but didn't need to. We could have eaten at the buffet non stop. There is plenty to do outside of the resort also: check out the cenotes for some cave snorkelling, as well as Excaret, which was very well done (don't leave before the shows. They are first class). Well, that's it. It is human nature to always wonder what is on the other side of the wall in everything we do and everywhere we go in life. We're always thinking how our experiences are relative to the next place. But for the Viva Azteca, I was happy because my family was happy.

Small family oriented resort. Fast check in and out. Management staff friendly and efficient. Rooms close to beach and pool. Rooms basic and but very clean. Excellent maid service with new towel art every day. I think all the linen on the beds were changed daily. Fridge provided but don\u2019t forget to plug it in when you arrive. Bottled water, coke and sprite provided daily. Beds set on cement slabs made for an uncomfortable first night but no problems after that. Quiet and efficient a/c. Loved that the patio door had a screen. We\u2019d open it around 5 AM to get fresh air. Never saw a bug in room or on our balcony. Small balconies but you can catch a glimpse of ocean from every room, I think. Well tended grounds with a sunken garden with real Mayan artifacts. Interesting wildlife on the grounds, including a black cat who was the main attraction it seemed. Quiet at night. Good water pressure in shower but problems with hot and cold. You\u2019d get 5 seconds of scalding hot and 5 seconds of cold..haha. Soap dispensers in washroom and shower. Large closet with drawers. Electronic safe \u2013 no charge \u2013 in room. Small boutique on site. Fun shopping plaza five minute walk from resort \u2013 felt very safe walking around. Huge Riu Palace next door - very ostentatious. Five dollars will pay a cab into downtown PDC \u2013 great place to spend the evening. Twelve dollars to Xcaret \u2013 a wonderful place to spend at least a day. The evening shows are a must see \u2013 the highlight of our trip. RESTAURANTS: Buffet : One part roofed, open to the courtyard, other part in the courtyard under the stars \u2013 very romantic with candlelight in the evening. Food was well prepared but nearly the same every day. Only 'theme night' we saw was the Mexican one.I\u2019m used to AI buffets but this one was frustrating. Fish was delicious but the same fish every day. Fresh breads daily with frozen butter packs - very hard to spread.Lots of custardy desserts and one or two choices of ice cream \u2013 the coconut one was fabulous. Breakfast had good variety, fresh omelettes made to order. Juices were very disappointing \u2013 all watered down concentrate at buffet and snack bar and only melons and bananas for fresh fruit. Great guacamole daily. The wait staff at buffet and bars were worked off their feet, no time for a few seconds chit-chat, a quick hola and on to business. Serve-yourself beer at lunch. They often ran out of food and it would take 10-15 minutes before refilling, if at all. Coffee was poor \u2013 have it at the bar across the way from their great espresso machine. La Scala: No ambiance, felt rushed. Entrees with lots of unidentifiable mixtures. We went twice because the men liked the beef but the second time it wasn\u2019t as good. Grouper was good first time, not the second. Shrimp risotto not nice. Best dessert was chocolate mousse. Bambu: Good ambiance, great waiters, good food. Sushi not bad, great spring rolls. Tempura had big shrimp in it. Not much for dessert. As usual, we had coffee from the bar after the meal. Caf\u00e9 Viva in PDC \u2013 $10. Six dollar cab took us to the Caf\u00e9. great service from good natured waiters. Meal included a welcome drink and a big glass of wine. Food very well presented and good. Pizza had way too much cheese on it \u2013 go for something else \u2013 it\u2019s worth it. Had delicious grouper in Tequila and mango marinade. Chocolate mousse same but better than La Scala. It was a fun evening away from resort. Great walking around PDC \u2013 lots of people eating and shopping \u2013 no cars allowed. We were never harassed by vendors or time share people at any time. In fact we had to run after them to ask questions. Very laid back. Snack Bar: hot dogs, hamburgers, good thin-crust pizza, the same pasta dish every day, good and plenty fries. Limited salad bar and desserts. Not many tables and hardly any in the shade. Serve-yourself soft drink, purified water and juice machines but again \u2013 juices very watered down. They even said it on the cards in front of machines \u201cmango juice with water\u201d etc.! Only saw fresh guacamole once at snack bar. Bar on other side of snack bar \u2013 long lines, barmen very rushed and they also had espresso machine at bar.Amazed to see that not many people tipped. They worked very hard and were very grateful for any tip. C\u2019mon people \u2013 have a heart! And Viva management \u2013 get an extra pair of hands here! Main Bar: Open 24 hrs. Great place to get a good cup of coffee in the early morning and some fresh pastries. Again, barmen very busy, need an extra pair of hands here too. Say hi to Guillermo! Live entertainment every night. A guitar player comes twice a week \u2013 great Stevie Ray renditions, this guy can play! BEACH: Sorry to report that there is a big beach erosion problem at Azteca \u2013 made a bit worse by hurricanes. As a result, the lounge chair area is shortened because there\u2019s a good 4 ft drop to the actual beach. Huge sandbags hold the beach back from further erosion and workers were filling more and spreading the sand in the lounge areas. Lots of new palm trees which will look great once they have more leaves. Lounge chairs not allowed on beach so it gets crowded.Waves don\u2019t knock you down so it\u2019s pleasant swimming in that beautiful turquoise water. Lots of new boogie boards which were much appreciated. On our first day I stepped on a piece of wood in the water and when I picked it up I found it was a board with 4 3\u201d nails sticking up out of it! It could have been the end of my or someone elses vacation. Don\u2019t know if it came from Cozumel or a boat. Didn\u2019t find anything else the rest of the week and the beach was clean and very enjoyable. This is not the beach for long walks, unless you can squeeze by the cement wall at the Allegro next door.The biggest problem was the towel game in the morning. I must have shade for health problems and I\u2019m usually down at the beach by 7:30 to reserve, go for breakfast and get back by 8:30. No palapas at 7:30, none at 6:30 either. Spent the last 3 days of vacation getting up at 5:30!..ridiculous! ACTIVITIES: Animators worked very hard and were always smiling. Lots of activities during the day. Some good shows in evening \u2013 great costumes. The kids seemed happy with their day. Animators come from all over the world. A special hi to Sara from Ottawa \u2013 great talent \u2013 See I told you you were in Trip Advisor! They also put on fun entertainment in the early evenings in the Courtyard \u2013 along with two nights of vendors and one night of great mariachi band\u2013 great ambiance. Scuba Caribe sells water activities. We took the Snorkelling tour for $30. Disappointed.We were told to be there at two but nobody showed up until 2:20 and we were rushed to the pick-up zone and treated rudely as if it was our fault. They take you out by Sea-Doo to the boat anchored at the Viva Maya \u2013 crazy wet ride there and back. Reef is off Xcaret Park. Reef is pretty with lots of fish but shallow and you have to follow the leader, so you get kicked and pushed by other snorkellers- a real traffic jam. Not for seasoned snorkellers but great for kids. All in all,it was a nice vacation but could have been better. The beach needs work, buffet needs more variety and some zing to it and staff needs to be increased. This place was not cheap - we've stayed at way better for way less. It was nice to be near PDC and Xcaret and be able to walk around feeling safe but we would choose another resort the next time we visited the area.", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern michigan", "Title": "\u201cWonderful family vacation\u201d", "Author": "tiffcare", "ReviewID": "UR4829040", "Content": "This was my third trip to the Cancun/Playacar area in 12 months with my husband and two teen age sons.

Our room was clean and in good repair, however, our view was that of a stairwell, Oh well... not a big deal as we were only in our rooms to sleep (no nooky with kids in room with us:( The beach and pool were very pretty with plenty of palm trees and places to sit. The entertainment at this hotel is superior to other places we have stayed at. As a woman, I enjoyed learning how to salsa dance with handsome male entertainment staff:) and enjoyed water aerobics and stretching by the pool every day for excercise. The evenings there are live shows with ? professional entertainers (Beauty and the beast for example). I admit that after multiple blue hawaii drinks at the pool I was pretty sleepy to enjoy the lounge bar at night. The service at the bars were adequate and drinks flowed strong and fast depending on what type of alcohol you ordered. I was not impressed with my usual choice of \"foo foo drinks\" such as strawberry marguaritas and dacquaris as they were weak. The beer at this hotel is dos equie by tap. For people who do not drink, there were multiple juices, lemonaide, ice tee and soda. There was no pool waiters or swim up bar so everyone would have to order there drink at the drink hut. The buffet was good in the court yard with a good variety even for the food critic. The Italian restaurant was pretty but the food was awful.

This was our first time to Mexico and at an all inclusive, but for the price we paid (we got a really good deal!) we were really happy. The check in and out we're really good-fast and pleasant in other words. Our room view was incredible-ocean and pool view. The room was simple yet always clean and got maid service everyday. We got great towel art which my son loved too! Our beds were fine, and our mattress at home is a Serta with a pillow top. My son slept with me and he didn't have a problem sleeping either. We were there when the Azteca had to shut off the water for part of the day-it was around 9am to about 4pm. Most people were at the beach, pool or on an excursion. In otherwords, it didn't affect many people except for mostly those who wanted to wash the sand off their feet/bodies from the ocean. I think shutting off the water at night would of been worse. There were repairs all week, but it never affect the water to our room when we needed it. The beach was really nice, especially the palapas for shade. The only unfortunate thing is that you have to get up really early (7ish) to save one, and leaving your towel does not guarantee that it will still be there for you later. I'm not saying saving is right, but everyone does it-what can I or the hotel (that would be ALL hotels) do? We always found a lounger at the beach or pool though, and if it was too bright, we moved it. Yes, the beach is shortened a bit from the previous hurricanes, but still plenty of beach for a smaller resort, and hey, at least we had a beach. The Allegro beside us had their beach totally wiped out and it was still not restored. The pool was nice too, and my son's favorite. Being under 2, he really liked the shallow part of the pool (about 4 inches deep). And the pool bar was great for having drinks and food nearby for the day. The food was pretty good. We ate at the buffet for just about every meal and at the pool bar for snacks in the afternoon sometimes. We loved the pizza and tortillas with fresh guacamole and salsa (you have to specifically order that) at the pool bar. The buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner had a good variety and plenty of food-you really couldn't go hungry. My son is extremly picky and I could still find something for him to eat-even though most of the time it was fries, bread, rice (the plain stuff). The food was always hot for us, but keep in mind the restaurant is open to the court yard and if you take more than 5 minutes to get back to your seat, your food will be only warm. We had one a la carte restaurant-La Scala. The food was really good. The only problem was that our reservation was at 7:30pm; we didn't eat till 8:40pm and by the time we were finished dessert it was just after 9pm. Not a good idea with a small child, but on the other hand, Mexico is much more relaxed about time than North America is. It's true, many people have written about it and we knew that ahead of time. Making reservations was good for us-we didn't get to the desk until 9:30ish and we could choose from 9pm the same night or 7:30 the next night. The animation/entertainment staff was really great. They spend their entire day entertaining adults as well as kids (with the kids club and junior club). Since my son was too young to join, he just played in their playground jungle gym (small but did the job). They had something scheduled every hour of the day-pool, beach and land activities. And they didn't harrass us to join either-just letting us know what was coming up and would we like to join. One staff member, Sara, was our favorite. She met my son and I when we were by the pool on our first day and asked where we were from. Turned out she was from Canada too, and everyday she made a point to say hi to us and especially my son. He took a real liking to her. He couldn't stop saying \"BY SAWA\" on the plane ride back. We noticed that many of the entertainment staff would even have their meals with the patrons. Of course we didn't notice that until Sara asked if she could join us for lunch one day. The shows at night are entertaining-some nights were awesome and other nights were not so great. But something to do and see for sure. All the staff was really nice to us and helpful, from the buffet staff to the maid staff. We even saw workers at night transplanting trees. And the hotel location is great-so close to Playa Del Carmen which is great for sightseeing. It's a smaller resort, and great for a family vacation. And a great price too!

Please, read the following comments: RESTAURANTS When you stay at the Azteca, you can reserve at either locations, i.e. the Azteca or the Maya. Please note that reservations are taken from 8am to 1pm; you can reserve up to 3 days in advance for the Azteca, and the day before for the restaurants at the Maya. You will also get a detailed sheet when you arrive, with the day each one is closed. It's about a 10 minute walk from one resort to the other. La Scala (Italian) @ Azteca: food - good to very good. The service was excellent. Better than several restaurants in Toronto. The steak was great, and try the chocolate desert! We recommand this A La Carte restaurant. Don Diego (Mexican) @ Maya: Food and Service were poor. As per another couple we met, it was below average. For us, it was a total mess. We do not recommand this restaurant. Miramare (Pizza & Pasta) @ Maya: Food - average to good. The service was good. We recommand it. Portofino (Mediterranean) @ Maya: Food and Service was very good. The waiter Louis was excellent. We wish we could have more money for tips. We strongly recommand this one. Viva Caf\u00e9 (Interational - Italian) in Playa Del Carmen: Definitely worth the $10 US! Take the time to walk in the area afterwards, as it's really nice. The cab from the hotel to the restaurant is about 50 pesos. Bambu (Oriental) @ Azteca: We didn't have a chance to try that one, but heard good feedback from others that went. BUFFET Good, but the meals were pretty much the same the entire week. We recommand the panini for lunch @ the Azteca. However, if you feel like pasta for lunch, go to the Maya. As for the breakfast, you should also go the Maya resort. They have more choices, and awesome omelettes! ROOMS The room was OK, and it was very clean. The A/C worked well. The only problem was the shower. We had good water pressure, however the temperature was intermittent from hot to warm and almost cold. It did not really bother us - as it's better than just cold water! See pictures. BEACH Unfortunately, it was only OK. The Azteca has an erosion problem. We can see big white bags. A few resorts beside the Azreca have the same problem. At least, it was pretty clean. The beach at the Maya is much bigger and no erosion problem. In addition, we can walk a long distance along the ocean from the Maya. See Pictures of the Azteca beach. STAFF Again, they were ok. They did nothing to impress us. However, we do have to say that they have a lot of energy - they start around 9ish in the morning, go all day, and entertain us at night in their show! As for the signature vacation rep., it was a dissaster. He does not seem to like is job. He should consider a new career. For us, a rep should at least be enthousiast, energetic and smile. OTHER ACTIVITIES We went to see the ruins in Tulum on our own. We walked to Playa Del Carmen and took the bus there (on 5th ave at the \"big\" bus station, which you can't really miss) - just don't forget to tell the bus driver where you want to get off! If you don't say anything, you will be droped off at the bus station in the city of Tulum - about a 30-40 minute walk passed the ruins! A return bus trip is about 60 pesos per person, and the entry for the site is 45 pesos per person. Make sure you bring your bathing suit, as you can go for a swim! Also note that it can get pretty hot there during the day! We also went for the dolphin swim @ Dolphin Discovery, which was definetely a fun experience! Please note that you can't do if you are pregnant, as the dolphins sense it and they can get nervous. The pictures they take are quite nice, and prices can go from $12 to $50 US depending which size you take, and how many. Also note that you can purchase a DVD of your dolphin experience, which can cost up to $50 US depending which package you bought. Finally, we consider this resort a little bit more than average, but it is not perfect. We may not go back.

The staff was not very friendly and getting a reservation to one of the resturants was inpossible, the beach was very samll and it was hard to find chairs in the shade even though I used alot of sunblock.

I had a diabetic person in my party and requested diet coke for the mini bar and did not recieve it until 10pm sunday night and we checked out monday. The food at the buffet was not very good it was the same for lunch and dinner, chicken, potatoes and vegetables. dinner looked like left over lunch it was warm and I was afraid of food poisioning. My friend is mexican and was born in mexico and is well aware of the language and culture and exchange rate etc, but when we talked with staff we could not get answers to anything it was always I dont know, I would have preferred to go eat in the economy but did not know where to go and the wait staff and bartenders were reluctant to say. My trip was only a few days but I felt I paid well enough money for the days I spent and did not recieve the service I expected, There was not a disco or a kids club that I seen I inquired but was not told of details I felt like I was fending for myself while I watched others being waited on. I was never asked if i wanted a drink while at the pool and did observe a waiter serving a young lady the entire time she was at the pool and suppling her with fresh drinks adn when asked for a drink he politely showed me to the bar, I observed cleaning staff leaving the back door of a patio dressing themselves as the were exiting the room, It was hard explaining to my 10 yr old what was going on, The population was primarily European and I did not find them friendly, I am from Texas and use to friendly conversational people, I attempted several time to reach expedia and spoke to a representative briefly and after 30 usd of phone cards was tired of trying to re-reach them for an answer.

Our vacation got off to a very bad start. We registered both of our children (4 & 5) the day after our arrival. On the second day, my wife had dropped off our 4 year old at the Kids Club and told the care taker that she was out side the club (15-20 feet away) on the beach if she needed anything. About 30 minutes later, I found my son wondering by himself calling out for his Mom and Dad in the pool area where I was with my daughter swimming. I looked around and I did not see my wife or any staff from the Kids Club. At this point I got very concerned and upset at what had just happened. My concern was that my son does not know how to swim and was by himself in the pool area and that someone could have taken advantage of him since he was alone. I went to go find my wife and told her what happened. After speaking to the staff, she (the staff member) said \u201cI let him go because he was going to his mom\u201d. She did not bother to take my son back to my wife nor did she make sure where he went when he went out of the door. Then she said \u201cI could not go after him and leave the other kids in the club alone.\u201d However, there were 2 staff members in the club and one of them could have taken my son to my wife. I had asked to speak to the General Manager and they brought the Activities Director to address my concern. He indirectly insinuated that it was not their fault as they can not control the kids. He lacked to comprehend the potential loss of a child and just brushed us off. The hotel staff did not recognize that they were in breach of contract, exposing them to potential liability, child abandonment, just to mention a few of their gross negligence. Also, the food at this hotel leaves a lot to be desired, especially their breakfast, which was bland and tiresome after only a few days. The service in the buffet area also needed attention. Not only do you have to get your own food (since it\u2019s a buffet), you have to get your own utensils, also having to sit at a table that was not cleaned up after someone else had used the table. There was enough staff there to assist; however, they seemed totally disinterested in their job responsibilities. Mid week, the hotel management decided to do plumbing repairs to the main water line. This was not a good idea since it was Spring Break, one of the peak busy periods for the hotels in the area. On top of this, they failed to inform guests that there would be no water to shower up or take a bath. I chose this hotel for a family vacation mainly based on the fact that it is a Wyndham Hotel, however, I was very disappointment and I will never use nor recommend this hotel.

There was a lot of variety and it was nicely presented, but often lukewarm and of inferior quality. The juice was always watered down and the baked goods tasted like they were from the day-old section of the bakery, for example. Forget about the sit-down restaurants - the week I was there, at least, it was almost impossible to get a reservation. There are too many rules and hoops to jump to get a spot in one of the restaurants - very, very annoying. You can stand in line at 8 a.m. for a reservation, and by 8:05 a.m. there may be no more spots. Clearly there's not enough space in the nicer restaurants to accomodate the number of guests in this hotel, and I think it's unconscionable that the hotel even advertises these restaurants as part of the package. Also, the beach was way too small - it appears it was shortened considerably by Wilma - and any seats under the tiki huts were \"reserved\" by 7 a.m. That said, it's a nice beach, and we were able to enjoy it quietly in the morning and late afternoon. On the plus side, I found the crowd to be very pleasant, mostly families, from the U.S., Italy, France and Germany. The bar is open 24 hours, and despite the fact I was there on a big spring break week, and that some folks started drinking at 10 a.m., I saw no drunken rowdiness. There are delicious non-alcoholic drinks which are basically smoothies, made to order, (my daughter loved the Conga Especial) and the bars are stocked with espresso machines, which made up for the bad coffee served at the buffet. The room was clean and nice enough, but 1) TV didn't work 2) beds were amazingly hard and 3) you'll need to bring your own soap and toiletries.

Even though there were still a few large sandbags that could seen, I'd say for the most part that the beach was in great shape - lots of soft sand that was wide enough for all the chairs, cabanas, and kids to build sandcastles. You can tell that they are working hard to get everything back in top shape. The room was fairly typical of most other hotel rooms I've seen - standard layout with two beds, tv, closet, etc. No alarm clock - though that might not be bad if you want to relax and don't have any early morning tours to get up for.

The staff were attentive, the food was at par with other airlines and the movies were first run (Walk the line and harry potter) I am a very nervous flyer and after telling the flight attendants they made sure to explain to me why we were experiencing turbulence, what the weather was like and just in general reassured me the entire flight. I really felt like they cared about my well being. Thumbs up to Skyservice. Also the captain on our way home was so friendly and was updating us constantly about airspeed, altitude, weather conditions and locations below. All of our flights left on time and both ways we were actually 1/2 hour early. Customs, baggage and all of the other airport stuff went very quickly, no problems. By the way I love Cancun Int'l airport so many ways to kill time while waiting for your flight. Hotel We arrived earlier than planned and as expected our room was not ready until 3PM. We actually went to the desk at 2:30 and they gave us our room early. We were in the new building (3) which is still having some work done. Nothing major, not too loud and only during the day. Just laying tiles and such. If you are the type to be in your room all day, then this building is not for you. As it may be too loud. We didn't have anyy problems with it though. The building is brand new so the room was excellent, tile floors and a huge bathroom! Nice soaker tub. Romms were very clean and the towel art was great. Our room was cleaned every day before lunch. TV stations are good too. Food We really enjoyed the food. If I had to pick the worst I would say La Scalla ala carte resturant wasn't great but, it was good. I really didn't like the house wine at this hotel....yuk! But, then again who comes to mexico for wine....drink beer and tequilla. The oriental Bamboo ala carte was really good we really enjoyed it. And the buffets were good and varied through out the days we stayed. The snacke at the pool bar were great for munching, the home made salsa and guac with nachos were my favourite. All the drinks were good and strong. They had a great collection of liquer and drinks. We also ate at the VIva cafe in Playa del carmen. This resturant is owned by the hotel and for 10 USD you get food and drink. The food was amazing here, some of the best italian I have ever eaten. The calamari is to die for! It is well worth the 10 dollars. We also ate at the blue parrot in playa del carmen, which was extra $$ but, my husband really wanted to have some good lobster. We got a coupon from guest services at the hotel and had and awesome lobster dinner for 14 USD each. Well worth it! Staff We found the staff to be great they were very friendly and warm, we even got some hugs on departure. This hotel is small and intimate and you really get to know the staff. The animation team are great, very fun and friendly. Great dance lessons and pool games. The night shows were entertaining! The front desk staff were attentive and when we complained about lack of hot water on our second last night, the problem was promptly fixed and we were given a basket of fruit in our room for the trouble. Beach We found the beach quite large campared to surrounding hotels and there were always beachairs available. It was never crowded and was kept very clean.

There were 9 of us in total from adults to teenagers and one seven year old. There were activities for everyone. The staff was just teriffic! Many of the staff spoke at least 3 languages. Very impressive. I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of international travelers that all stayed there. I felt very safe at the hotel. The kids were scattered all over the place doing their own thing. My children met a number of different friends that they are now keeping in touch with through e-mail. The staff that worked so hard all day also put on great shows at night! We enjoyed the well choreographed productions. The rooms were just average, but kept very clean. Every day after the rooms were made up, an animal made from folded towels was placed on the bed. Quite clever ! If something was wrong with the room, they moved very quickly to resolve the problem. We went on one excursion, \"Xel-Ha\" a natural water park, highly recommended! The kids didn't want to leave their new friends at the hotel, I was perfectly content chilling out by the pool or the beach. My husband, son and his friend are golfers. Right across the street is a very nice golf course. They ended up playing the course 3 times! They rated the course a 7 out of 10. Definitely worth the $5.00 taxi is going into the town of \"Playa Del Carmen\" Very good shopping, restaurants and bars. The town has a great vibe to it! The biggest negatives about the hotel is that whirl pool by the main pool is not hot! It should be a Jacuzzi with Hot Water! Jennifer from \"Guest Relations\", if you are reading this, you should really try to have the whirlpool changed, and maybe add another one. The transportation from the airport to the hotel and back should be provided by the hotel so we don't get overcharged for the trip.

It was our 4th stay at this resort, and we were deeply disappointed. When we got to our room, there were no soap, no shampoo/conditioner etc. Water pressure was a serious problem, with no water at all from the tap and only a trickle from the shower. After we complained, the water pressure was fixed and we received one (cheap) wall dispenser of soap - no other toiletries. We found all members of the staff friendly and hard working, but unable to cope with the number of guests. In the main dining room (buffet) there was no service at all, i.e. guests had to get their own coffee, wine, etc. while waiters ran non-stop just to clear and re-set tables. Food quality has deteriorated as well. Mind you, everything was well prepared, but it was evident that while before they had a \"chef\", they now had \"cooks\" in the kitchen. We found the quality of food in the Scala restaurant to be no better. - On one occasion we visited the \"Don Diego\" restaurant at the Viva Maya and found both the service and the food outstanding! Unfortunately, the Viva Azteca has lost almost its entire beach, which meant that all beach activities were moved to the pool, where various activities vied for space in the only pool. Many activities were cancelled or curtailed, and for that reason we walked over to the Viva Maya and participated in the well organized activities there. In conclusion, the Viva Wyndham Azteca has added at least one additional building to squeeze more people into a rather limited space. A staff member told us that there were over 1,000 guests at the time of our visit. The disappearing beach added to the feeling of overcrowding. Beach chairs were placed side by side on whatever little beach remained with hardly any shade (worse than Euroean beaches). We will definitely not return to this resort. This was a \"classy\" resort before Wyndham took over, but both the quality and the clientele have changed.

Next day, it warmed up, but cool in evening. Our initial response to the hotel was not good. They put the new arrivals into Building #3, a new building and still being worked on. Very noisy in the morning as workers began their day early. Very noisy at night (til after midnight) as this building is the closest to the bar. Also, the building smelled musty due to the concrete not curing yet. Most newcomers asked to be moved, and were accommodated. We moved to building 2 (close to pool/bar) and this room had an oceanview. Very good. This hotel is very popular with Europeans. Our first week saw many Italians (many young) which made for a very loud first week. After they left, things calmed down with the mostly Canadian, American, and German crowd. The staff were extremely friendly, helpful and polite. Anything you asked about/for, you received. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, the buffet was very good, and the a la carte restaurants were fabulous. The pool was cool and clean. The beach was not as small as reviews have stated and was clean. The ocean was a little on the cool side and a bit rough most days. Good for boogieboarding. The nightly shows were really good and the animation staff had alot of things happening during the day. The kids club was fun for (mostly) small kids though they did have a junior club (ages 13 - 17), but we only saw it used twice. Staying at this hotel gives you access to the Viva Wyndham Maya a few doors down. The shows at the Maya were good, but their food and pool were not as good as the Azteca, with the exception of the Miramar (a la carte), which was very nice. The hotel had tours you could book on-site. However, these were expensive (as at all the hotels). We rented a car at Zipp Rent-a-car for not much money, and went to all the tourist places on our own. Chichen Itza cost our family a total of $51.00US (4 of us including car rental) as opposed to $400.00US out of the hotel. For those who do not care to drive, go to the travel agency in Playa and you can get to Chichen Itza for $35.00US for the bus and tour inclusive. Also advisable is taking the Lonely Planet Book (or similar). The advise given in the book was bang on. A downside? It seems that there is a 500% increase in the number of people approaching you about time shares. New twist, they're not called timeshares anymore. They're called membership packages and every hotel had about 4 representatives out there flogging their hotels. We couldn't walk more than 10 feet before being approached. Funny enough, once we were really tanned, no one bothered us anymore. Would we go again? Absolutely. We spent two weeks there so we had plenty of time to explore. Must sees: Chichen Itza - If you go on your own (via car), try and stay overnight at one of the many hotels there. There is a phenomenal light and sound show every night at 7:00p.m. which is not available on the tours from the hotels. Another must-see is Xcaret - This one is an all-day one. Its expensive, but well worth it. The underwater caves for snorkelling or just floating down was great. Also, don't miss the nightly shows (which is worth the admission on its own) was out-of-this-world. Xel-ha was a water-day. Its an ecological park that's open to the ocean and you snorkel around the reefs and see fantastic fish. Also, you float on inner tubes through mangroves and out into the lagoon again. Bring lots of sunscreen. Both Xcaret and Xel-ha have all-inclusive options (includes your food and drinks once inside). We didn't take this option and were sorry later. Its only about $15.00 more.

All in all we had a great time, and would go back to the Mayan, but probably not this particular resort.", "Date": "February 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belleville Ontario", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing & Friendly Viva Azteca\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4398987", "Content": "We chose the Viva Azteca because of its size. It is a smaller resort compared to the mega resorts all around it. The staff are very friendly and are eager to please. The resort sits right on the beach and we could see the pool, beach and gardens from Room 1221. The construction of the mega RIU resort next door did not affect us at all, as it is just about ready for occupancy. My only concern with this new resort is there is no beach for them, and they will probably encroach on the Azteca's little private haven. The Recreation staff are absolutely amazing. These young people (our favourites were Sarah and Juan) work their butts off to keep you entertained and feeling welcome. They perform a show every evening at 9:30 and we have no idea when they ever had time to rehearse as they were always at the beach or pool entertaining us! Our room was clean and comfortable. You control your own temperature. The balconies are small but we did not spend much time in our room, only to shower and sleep. The beach is beautiful. They have trucked in loads of sand to build up the beach again after the hurricane. They have done an excellent job. The Azteca's beach is like a little private haven. On one side the next hotel's breakwall sits right on the waters edge, so on a rough day no one comes around it. On the other side is the mega RIU which I mentioned might cause a problem when it opens. But security is always visible and hopefully will keep them off the Azteca's beach chairs. If you want a beach chair under the shade, then you need to get up early to claim with your towel. But you can find a beach chair in the sun at any time of day. The bartenders are the friendliest! You rattle off a name of a drink and they can mix it for you. We do have to admit the food was not top notch. But our only comparison is a cruise where the food was amazing. But we did not go hungry, there was always something you would like on the buffet or at the a la carte restaurants. Our favorites were the Bamboo and Portofino restaurants. We felt very safe eating the food. We had a great relaxing vacation with our friends. Lots to drink, lots of sun, lots of new friends... I would recommend the Viva Azteca to either families or mid lifers. Not a great place for the young party goers looking to meet the same. Those expecting pristine accomodations and perfection, go find it someplace else.

Service was excellent and friendly everywhere. The beach had apparently been much larger before hurricane wilma - but was still fine. Our room smelled for the first day we were there - I thought it was musty from the humid climate. But then the smell went away - still not sure what to make of that. Other than that the room was comfortable, clean, and had all the right amenities... but was about as bland as a hotel room can be. There are definitely nicer resorts in this area but anyone that chooses Viva Azteca should find it very pleasant. The longer I stayed the more I enjoyed myself. The resort is a nice size (not too big). The pool was just right - not too crowded and quite clean. There was construction on both sides of the resort (one new hotel, one hurricane damaged hotel) but it did not cause any problem. Using hotels (for the first time) was convenient. I did not have to pay the resort anything during the entire stay. I was not too impressed with Playa Del Carmen. Puerto Aventuras was a fun place to spend a few hours - seeing the dolphins, manatees, and seals for free.

They told us to bring 1 change of clothes (thankfully I brought 5). We were brought to another smaller sturdy hotel to ride out the storm. The staff was great considering how few supplies we were given. After the 4th day we were allowed back to the Azteca. What a shock. No water, no lights, trees destroyed, the reception area wiped out, the restaurants were flooded because of holes in the windows and the roof, the pool area was littered with vegitation and sand, and the beach had severe erosion. The Staff did their best to make the atmosphere upbeat, and it worked! We did get electricity and cool water in the rooms. The buffet area partially opened and they cooked like no tomorrow, shrimp, steaks all extra special dishes that were great! We were able to get a flight home after 4 extra days of being stranded.

I will try to keep this short. My wife and I stayed here from 5/30-6/6 for our honeymoon. This was our first trip to Mexico. Now I will get started. We walked off the plane to into the airport and the customs people helped us fill out the form and were very nice. After we got out of customs and walked outside we were bombarded by people wanting to give us a ride. We were safe and already had our tranportation booked in advance. This guy walked up and said our transportation name and we said yes. He grabbed our bags and put them on a hand cart. I was nervous at first but then he brought us right to the stand that had our transpotation info. Then he took our bags to the van. Now we are on our way to Playa Del Carmen from Cancun which was about a hour ride. The sceanery was terrible. But the country in poor outside of big citys so what do you expect. We met some nice people from North Dakota on the van ride who helped us with our money. I did not know that we needed alot of 1 dollar bills. So they were so nice to give me 50 ones for a 50 dollar bill. So first lesson: Bring at least $100 in ones for a weak stay just for tips. The mexican people make there living off of tips. They get like $5 a day for pay. Also if you tip well they will treat you good. Now we come to the hotel and it is fabulous. We walk in to the front desk and they bring us a drink. We start to check in and we had requested a king bed away fron the construction on the north side. They had one room that had a king bed on that side but it was closer to the ocean than the construction. The room was perfect. The bed is kinda small for a king but we are tall people so deal with it. I slept fine. Oh I forgot the bell boy Pedro was super nice and brought our bags to the room for us. If you stay here tell him we said hello. He is soo nice. Please tip him well. Now we walk around the resort and it is great. The pool is big, the bar is big and the buffet is big. The beach is still there and is the biggest beach in the Playacar area. Well the Viva Maya is a little bigger but you can use it to. The next hotel to the south is the Allegro and it has no beach. Really NO beach. I am glad we didnt stay there. Now I am dragging this to long so I will make it quick. The buffet is great. If you are in the states you probably eat at Golden Corral or Quincy's buffet places. Well you go and pay to eat there and here you eat all the time for free. I know you pay all inclusive but figure up how it will cost to eat there three meals a day. Thats what I thought. Anyway the buffet food is good. They change it up a little eveyday but its good food. The restaurants are all great. I will not get into to much detail about them. They all have great food. The only thing I can say about them is reserve with guest services as soon as you get there. They fill up fast. Next the staff are all friendly and help you with anything. There is always something to do there and they try to get you involved.They are fun. The shows are fun. The staff work all day and them do the shows at night. So cut them some slack. Not to many kids there when we were there, but kids dont bother me. The resort is always clean and the alcohol plentyfull. Yes the liquor is watered down. But all you have to do is pay for one drink. You know, give the bartender $5 if you are going to hang out and drink for a while. He will hook you up after that. As my wife says \" Heavy on the liquor, Light on the mixer\". That always worked.I cant think of anything else. Now I will give you some pointers: 1. Bring alot of 1 dollar bills. You cannot get them in Mexico. 2. Be friendly to the staff. They like it when you speak spanish even if all you know is Gracias,Hola, and Adios. If you are friendly to them thay will be friedly back. 3. If you are American, the europeans dont like you that much. They cut in line and stare at you. I dont know why unless there parents failed to tell them it is not polite to stare. Also most of them are rude and selfish so just ignore them. 4. If you are european----------------sorry I am ignoring you! 5. Finally, Go with an open mind. If you are a food critic stay at home. If you expect to pay $1000 and get treated like a movie star at a 3 star resort, stay at home. If you are a rude person, stay at home. If you dont like kids, go to a adults only resort and quit whining. If you critisize everthing stay at home. Well thats all. We could not have asked for a better honeymoon. Of course ther was a few problems, but nothing major. We understand that things happen and we didnt dwell on that. We had a great time and met some great poeple.(even europeans)So for all the people that keep giving this place bad reviews because the pool was to warm, or a kid threw a hambuger in the pool, or the food is not world class, or bla bla bla. Grow up! Quit being so childish! Nobody is perfect. If you are looking for a great place to stay that will not break the bank, I would highly recommend this resort. We will for sure come back. I am adding 2 pictures. One of the pool and one of the beach. Also I am adding a picure of the map so you can get a idea of how the Playacar lays out and where other hotels are.

Resort was well maintained and in a great location. We did not attend the shows, so I cannot comment on those. As Americans, we were definitely in the minority, but we had not problems with anyone there. Hotel is about 50-60 minutes from the airport. Take another 30-40 minutes to go through customs at the airport. So allow around 2 hours before you actually can get checked in to your room and on the beach. Disregard any sales people wanting to take you somewhere. Also, disregard the VIP gift and sales pitch at all cost. Food: The buffet was great for breakfast. A wide assortment. However, do not eat there for dinner. La Scala was by far the best. I would try to get reservations there each night if you can. We did go over to the Maya and ate at Portofinos. It was ok, buy not as good as the La Scala. We did not eat at any other place. The Cenote buffet is pretty weak for lunch, but we filled up on French Fries. The bar was ok. They did have Bacardi Rum and Wild Turkey Whisky. That was the only brand names that we saw. Hopefully you like Dos XX beer. Put some lime in it and go on. When we visited the Maya Hotel, it was not as nice as the Azteca. At least the outside and grounds were not. We paid $640 a piece for the Azteca package. If we had paid $800 or more, we would have been mad. You get what you paid for. We did walk out of our resort about a mile up to the left and went to a shopping area. This was nice and found some t shirt bargins. Definitely take a cab into town, about 4 dollars. Go down 5th street at night. This is fun with shops, bars and resturants. Fun, Fun. If you scuba, go on the morning dives. It is calmer waters . Do not go to the dive site meaning Gardens. We saw nothing here. I hear those that went to Tortuga site, saw so many turtles. Have fun and remember that this is Mexico and things are very slow....you must have patience or you will have a melt-down. Next time we will go to Cozumel for diving. If you have booked...Have fun.

Check-in: We arrived aprox. 8.30 PM, so it was already dark. We got a key for room 1140 (I think it was), which was right next to the construction site. We mailed for a room in building two, but that side of the hotel was full. Next day we could change to room 2220. We're glad we did, because the sound of jackhammers isn't very pleasant, early in the morning. Complex and beach: Very nice lay-out, jungle-like garden, birds, great courtyard with the restaurant, bar and shop next to it, great pool + bar, GREAT beach (where is the erosion?? they managed a great job on reparing the beach. Allegro and Hideaway still have poor beaches!), overall a very nice hotel. Heard that the size is the plus, because the other resorts are very big and crowded. Rooms: Very clean room, perfect beds, tv not too good, but hey, who wants to look tv? Bathroom good, just took showers. AC very good (sometimes too good, got too cold), no bugs/dust/broken things. Allmost no balcony, but kept door allways closed. Cleaning excellent, tips (2 bucks each day) appreciated. Gets you 'towel-animals' on the bed. Personel: At the front desk okay, haven't spoken much with them. All waiters friendly, very friendly after tipping. Animation-team great, alltough they have favourite guests with whom they interact more. Every evening great show, those people love what they do, and it shows! Kids-club is okay, but our kids are somewhat too old for that (10/11). They were allmost whole day at the pool. Food and drinks: Just used the buffet, with children the best to do. Haven't eaten much, was too hot most of the days. Much variety (chicken/pork/beef/fish), also pizza and spaghetti. Lunch at the poolbar okay (pizza, french fries, salad, macaroni). Discovered after some days they make you hamburgers. But WATCH OUT!! We became sick the last day, and we're sure it's because of those hamburgers (not well done). Montezuma got his revenge after all!! Drinks at poolbar and in the bar/restaurant great, but we allways drank the same (Mexican XX beer, cola, Cuba Libre). Tried the wine, not so good. Mixes/cocktails too sweet for our taste. Pool: Warm water, not very crowded, during the day many plays at the pool (polo, volley, aerobics). BEWARE!! Got after some days an ear-infection, sure because of the warm pool-water, a great environment for bacteriae (that's what the doctor said). Heard more people complaining of infections due to the water. Gave notice at the front desk, but they answered pool was cleaned every night. Cleaning was mainly dredging, they allmost used no desinfectant (chlorine). Every morning towel-play at pool (and beach). Have to get up early to get a shady place (6.15 AM!) and put your towel on a chair (take own towels with you). There are only few places in the shade. Have changed the hotel-towels some days. Couldn't understand the registrationsystem they use, but never had any problems; changed during the day. Beach + sea: Brilliant. The colours!! Many things to do/hire at the beach. Beach not eroded anymore, wide enough. Water excellent, allmost no weeds. Waves make much fun!!. Walking along the coastline difficult because of erosion at Allegro/Hideaway. A great vacation at a great resort! Pro's: size resort, clean rooms, beach and pool, weather (!)

The food is boring, the variety nonexistent. Every buffet featured three kinds of fish filet (which were indistinguishable from each other), two kinds of chicken, and pork that looked and tasted like shoe leather. And rice, rice, rice, rice...okay, I like rice, but enough is enough. They actually served stew and cabbage rolls; this is not the sort of food we are seeking on a tropical vacation. The bread is awful. The one high spot was \"Mexican Night\" when we had our best meal comparatively, but it still wasn't what we'd call great or even good. The restaurant is set in a nice little plaza with some outside tables...by sitting outdoors, you can avoid the stifling heat inside, but the tradeoff is many stray cats brushing around your ankles looking for a meal. The front desk staff is aloof and unhelpful, and only showed interest when they were trying to collect extra charges (see Beach Towels, following). We arrived at 10:30 at night and had to hump our suitcases up three flights of stairs to our room. They told us that dinner was over, but we could enjoy the \"snacks\" at the Cenote bar...this turned out to be ham and processed cheese sandwiches on white Wonder Bread, sealed in plastic wrap. Mmmmm. Okay, about the Beach Towels: they have an absurdly laborious system of tracking who has signed out and signed in the beach towels. Two young men sit in a hut all day transcribing room numbers from loose sheets of foolscap to a huge ledger. If they make an entry error, you may discover when you go to return your towels before 6 pm like good little guests that you are accused of having stolen your used towels from another guest. Our friends had to browse through several sheets of paper to prove they had indeed signed the towels out that morning... Also during our week, someone took our kids' towels from the ledge by the pool where they were swimming, and we were sent to the front desk where stern manager Omar demanded $20 U.S. for each \"missing\" towel. I don't enjoy paying $5,000 to spend my day at the beach anxiously monitoring my beach towel, and to be treated as if I'm part of some beach towel crime ring. By the way, although you are supposed to give up your towel before 6 o'clock, the pool is open until 8. They have a kids' club which says it's for all kids up to age 12, but no self-respecting child over age 6 would set foot there...that was okay, as our kids swam all day long, but if your child isn't a water person he'll get pretty bored with the remainder of activities, which consist of two ping-pong tables. They did have a kids' show each night at 9:15, which was nice, although mostly it was just Simon Says and Musical Chairs. The resort advertises \"Premium Brands\" of liquor, but aside from a single bottle of Smirnoff, we didn't see any. The tropical drinks are nice but didn't seem to contain any alcohol at all. The beer is Dos Equis on tap, and seems weak. The bartenders are nice guys, and speak several languages. It's not all about tips (which we did give several times throughout the week): if you simply smile at them, and treat them with the same respect they give you, they'll call you \"Corazon\" and treat you like royalty. Meanwhile, although the hotel itself gives out literature warning against aggressive timeshare salespeople, there was a constant presence of Viva salespeople who buttonholed us daily, trying to convince us to attend their own hourlong pitch to book our next several vacations with Viva. A favourite spot for them was at the end of the only path to the restaurant, so that they could make sure to hit every single guest on the way to dinner. In summary, although we can count up lots of positives: the Mexican staff were lovely people, the bathrooms spotless, the beach and pool beautiful -- our overall experience was flatly disappointing.

As far as the food, the buffet was a typical buffet it was OK. La Scala was very good, the portions were pleantiful and the service we found to be excellent, you'd be surprised what a tip does. The asian restaurant gave scant portions and refused to give two entrees which were more the size of appetizers. Portofino's at the Maya was not what we expected the reviews raved about it we found the service poor and the food lacking. Yes, the drinks are watered down so don't expect much of a buzz!! There were plenty of beach towels available however if you wanted a lounge chair by the pool you had to get up before 8' because everyone puts there towels on them to reserve them, but you don't see the people for much of the day, which we found to be quite rude and selfish. There are plenty of activies by the pool going on all day. And there is a show each night. The rooms are clean however as far as draw space they are very limited, there are two small draws in the closet and a tiny night table draw, there are however, two shelves in the closet which you could use for draws. There is no clock in the room, which seemed a little strange and if you are as lucky as us you will be in the rooms by the construction next door which begins at 7:30 each morning except Sunday. Our room faced the pool and the 24 hour bar which on several nights was very noisy till 2 am. The resort in all is well kept the rooms alittle outdated, but clean, the staff very friendly.

Me, My husband, and 9 yr. old daughter. Although this is our 1st time to Playa Del Carmen, we have been to Cancun (2x), Bahamas (2x), Jamaica (2x), Dom. Rep.,Hawaii, and St. Lucia. Using these as comparison, the Viva Azteca is a very clean resort, but lacks in service and food quality. Pros - - Very clean - grounds, room, beach - Pool Bar - service is good, drinks ok - Small resort - not over crowded - Beach - beautiful (not eroded at this resort) - Food - Viva Cafe' restaurant in town was excellent. This is part of the AI, but with an extra $10 dollar charge. (kids 10 & under free) - Food - Bambu (japanese) was very good. - Food - Mexican was OK. - Town of Playa Del Carmen is great. A nice evening out with shopping and restaurants. $4 taxi ride each way. Cons - - Front Desk - tried to charge me for my daughter, altough I already paid. They made me call expedia to fix it. almost 40 minutes to check in. Front desk help always seemed to have attitude when dealing with them. - Food - Dinner Buffet is horrible, no variety (edible, but just blahh!) - Food - Lunch Buffet is the same as dinner buffet. - Food - Poolside Buffet - same thing everyday. - Water sports - Need to be very patient, due to poor scheduling. Limited use of equipment, excuse is that the jet skiis are broken (all 3) - Not much for kids to do. The Kids club is for little kids and the nightly shows are too late at night. 9:45 pm start. Scuba Diving My husband booked the Mexican Package (7 dives - 2 cenote, 2 cozumel, 3 local - with Scuba Caribe at the beach. The scheduling was very poor. The pick-up for cenotes and cozumel was always late. The Local dives were overbooked and he had to argue with them to be taken out for the local dives that he paid for. They told him that they were full and that there was no refund, he luckily was able to get on a boat at the Viva Maya, but had to walk down the beach with all his equipment to get on the boat. He said the Cenotes were the best, and that the Divemaster \"Rigo\" was great. Summary - We loved Playa Del Carmen, we would definitely come back - Just not to the Viva Azteca.

We loved it but five days is just too short. ROOM: We were on the third floor and would highly recommend it. The stairs can get a bit taxing at times but the room makes up for it. It had vaulted ceilings which made the room more airy and appear bigger. Everything was neat and clean. We had no problems sleeping on the beds and the bathroom is realatively large. Also, try to get a low numbered room(ex. 2309, 09- was closer to the beach. We were able to see the ocean from the room). BEACH: We had no problem with it other than the fact that we didn't spend enough time at it. It was very clean. There was enough to walk along or lay out on, whichever your preference. The water was warm and wonderful. I went snorkeling. Didn't see much, but I did see some fish. We found the place to go to see coral and sea life is Akumal. We saw fish, lobster, coral and one really big fish! NIGHTLIFE: We can't say too much about this because we were dead tired by that time of night. But, they did have quite the variaty of shows and parties planned. FOOD: We really like the food. However, we both had adverse reactions. Not sure what caused it though. Bring malox and pepto. Our first night was at La Scala. It was excellent. Might want to stay away from the 'uncooked' beef. It tasted good, but... The next night we visited the Portofino. It also was very good. But, of the three ala cartes, I think this was my least favorite. The third and fourth night we went to Bamboo. Obviously we liked it because we went there two nights in a row. The first night we sat at the hibachi table. The food was very good but it wasn't as entertaining as the Japanese steak houses here in the US. There was enough food to feed a small army. The spring rolls were great. The next night we sat at a table. The food was also very good, though I preferred the hibachi. At all the ala cartes the food presentation was impeccable. The buffet was a buffet: lots of variety, not as good a quality as the others. SIDE TRIPS: We went to Xcaret and Chichen Itza. Xcaret, and swimming with the dolphins, was great. I would highly recommend it. The wildlife was incredible to see, dolphins, bats, turtles, manatee... The river wasn't that great. If you just want to hang out and mellow as you float down a river, it's great. If you want to see sea life, enter at the end. Chichen Itza was a great experience. I am glad we went, but would visit ruins much closer next time. It is a long drive. I would not suggest anyone go via tulum and coba. It's a lot longer and the bargains aren't that great. If you drive, beware. Stop signs mean slow down and look so you don't get t-boned. Passing is the responsibility of the person coming toward the passing vehicles to get out of the way. We were always glad to get back to Azteca. If we return, we will definitely stay there again. The staff is great. Christina even got my husband to play bocchi.

Travel First up \u2013 we left at 6:30 am out of Dayton Ohio then to Houston & Cancun. Flights were no problem. When we arrived in Cancun around 11:30 am I was prepared for standing in line for a while. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! We were thru everything within an hour, probably only 30-45 minutes, including being on the van and ready to head out! I don\u2019t know if traveling mid-week (Wed) or what caused it to be so speedy but I\u2019m not going to question it! We (self, hubby, kids 11 & 8) were on the van with another family of 3 who were also going to our resort (Viva Maya) and a couple going to ASP. We were first on and only had to wait about 5 mins til everyone else was loaded \u2013 never had that happen. The resort Ride to the resort was uneventful. At the Viva Maya we and the other family unloaded and my husband and the other guy proceeded to the desk to check in. It was at that point both of them heard those 2 little words you hate to hear when you arrive at your destination \u2013 \u201cWhat reservation?\u201d They had booked thru AAA and we had booked thru American Express vacations, but the travel company in Mexico is the same one for both. So I can\u2019t say if the problem was the fault of the resort or the travel company. In either case, both my hubby and the other guy tried to contact our travel companies but the front desk staff apparently aren\u2019t trained in making calls outside the country. They attempted to contact the rep from the local travel company but he was out to lunch \u2013 how convenient!! After almost an hour of being told \u201cwe have no rooms at all\u201d 2 rooms magically became available. Both parties had booked and paid for \u201csuperior oceanview\u201d rooms but the rooms they offered us were garden view \u2013 better known as facing the dumpster of the resort next door! They also told us there were 2 rooms at the Viva Azteca. We all decided to check out both sets of rooms and decide. At this point it was a fait accompli that we would end up at the same resort as the other family \u2013 their daughter and ours were the same age and quickly became BFFs for the rest of our stay!!! We took a taxi (Viva Maya\u2019s expense) to the Azteca and looked at the rooms there. They were both pool and oceanview, one ground floor and one on the next level. Both families decided to stay there as the view was much nicer and the rooms were bigger. The rooms at the Maya were oddly shaped and seemed rather smallish and the bathroom was very small \u2013 all in one room. The rooms at the Azteca were not giant but certainly comparable with other resorts we had stayed at in the area (Riu Playacar & IB* Paraiso). The bathrooms consisted of a sink area with a long vanity with one sink (2 would have been nice but not necessary) and a separate room with toilet & shower/bath combo. The room had 2 beds which I think were queen as they seemed a little larger. Also a long shelf which held the TV and also served as a desk. A small table & 2 chairs were also in the room. Closet contained an electronic safe (which was plenty big enough for what we put in it \u2013 cell phones, wallets, game boys, iPods & MP3 players, travel docs, my jewelry & camera), a fridge that was stocked every day with 2 waters, 2 Cokes & 2 Sprites (Diet Coke was not available in the can in the rooms or even at the little store on property, and in the middle of our stay they even ran out of Coke and only had Sprite & orange soda for a few days), iron & board, a top shelf and 2 smaller shelves & 2 small drawers above the fridge and plenty of closet space. It seemed odd to me that there was not a ceiling fan but the room was never too hot. We took the ground floor room and had a small patio with a table & 2 chairs, but the 2nd floor room had a very small balcony not even big enough to sit on. We ordered a cot brought in on the 2nd day so the kids could each have a little of their own space along with some extra pillows (hubby & I each use 3) which were all brought fairly quickly. We were quite pleased with the Azteca as it is a smaller resort and, IMHO, much nicer. No swim up bar but hey you can\u2019t have everything! We did finally get in touch with our tour rep, who apologized for the inconvenience and told us the Azteca was much nicer anyway. We proceeded to spend the afternoon at the pool and had some lunch at the snack bar which was at the pool bar. The food was pretty good \u2013 fries, chips & cheese, fresh salad & fruits, pizza, burgers, hot dogs, always a type of rice and desserts. Pool & Beach The pool was nice. It never seemed crowded. There was an area which was only 1 \u00be feet deep for the smaller kids that was partitioned off from the rest of the pool. The main part of the pool was \u201cL\u2019 or \u201cV\u201d shaped and was all just over 4 feet deep. Around 1 part of the pool was a very shallow area (2 inches) on 2 sides which was nice for just sitting in and relaxing or sliding off for the kids, also some of the \u201cpool games\u201d took place there. There was a whirlpool with jets but it was never hot so I can\u2019t really say it was a \u201chot tub\u201d but the kids enjoyed playing in it as well. The beach was nice. The erosion was about what we had expected. Usually plenty of chairs but the towel game was in full play. There was one day that we didn\u2019t hit the beach til afternoon and had trouble finding a chair. There were four chairs very close to the ocean \u2013 2 were occupied, the next one had a towel on it and the fourth one on the end was empty. I made to set our bag & towels down and the couple in the other chairs (I think German \u2013 not sure) informed me that it was their chair. Silly me for not knowing that nothing on it meant it was theirs. They were not nasty about it though and I found one right nearby. That was the biggest \u201cdrama\u201d we had! The days we didn\u2019t get up and around til after 8 or so were the days we had trouble finding chairs. Even though there are 4 of us we usually only get 1 or 2 chairs as we are not sitting in them, just stashing our stuff. It was much more difficult to find a chair at the pool than at the beach. There was a small bar set up on the beach during the daytime as well as the bar which was by the pool. It was up higher than the pool so there were 2 sets of stairs and 1 ramp to get up there. There never seemed to be a long wait to get a drink. My daughter and her friend drank Shirley Temples all week!!! The only thing that was a bit odd was the soft serve ice cream machine was on the counter which was fairly high up. I\u2019d say the counter was probably more than 4 ft high. I had to reach above my head (I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d) to operate the soft serve machine for the girls. It would be nice if they would put it on a lower counter. The snack bar end of the bar area was a lower counter so the kids were able to get foods by themselves easily. The second day my husband called AMEX vacations and they apparently called the front desk. Later that afternoon a bottle of champagne was delivered to our room! The next day we got robes & slippers. So they did make an effort to rectify their error. They also told us the second day that there was another room available with a better view. It was in the opposite building a bit further back from the beach, on the third floor right by the stairs. My husband looked at it but we decided to stay where we were. We were also offered a credit in the amount of $10 US per adult per day \u2013 a total of $140 which we feel was too low, but they did not budge. So we accepted it and my husband will be trying to work that out with AMEX now that we are home. We used the credit toward an excursion to Xel-Ha (the kids & I got to swim with the dolphins, but that\u2019s a whole other trip report!!) but we could have used it for spa services or merchandise, etc. There seemed to be one or two group of HS/college age kids there but they were never a problem. I never did find out of they were with parents or not. The first night there was a loud jerk outside our door but it was only for a moment and we never had that happen again. Maid service was very good. We only hung out the Do Not Disturb a couple times and tipped $5 US when we had them make up the room. The first day we had a towel hat on the bed. The second day we got an elephant, on which the maid had placed my spare sunglasses \u2013 too cute!! The next time we had the room made up we got a dinosaur on top of the TV, a rabbit on the table and an alligator on one of the beds!! And she would always straighten our shoes up and line them up. The Food Breakfast was great! There were freshly made omelets, large variety of pastries, meats, fruit, cereals, yogurts, French toast & pancakes, juices & milk (which was never cold enough for my taste! But then I like it really cold!) Also hot chocolate & Mexican coffee (which were killer when mixed together \u2013 instant Starbucks!!) My husband\u2019s only complaint about breakfast was that soft drinks were not available at breakfast \u2013 the fountain was always turned off in the morning. He doesn\u2019t drink coffee and had to go by the bar to get his morning caffeine fix. The bar was open 24 hours, and from 10am \u2013 7pm lunch was available and again from 10pm \u2013 7am the \u201cdelli\u201d was open \u2013 fruit & desserts as well as 2 types of sandwiches, usually a salad type sandwich (egg salad, etc) and a lunchmeat & cheese sandwich, each in individually wrapped halves. I never tried them so I can\u2019t say if they were any good or not. They did not look bad, I was just never hungry for them. Lunch was available at either the buffet restaurant or at the pool bar. We only had lunches at the snack bar so I can\u2019t speak to what was available at the buffet. As I previously mentioned, lunch was always very tasty. Not an overabundance of tables available around the bar, and only a few of those in the shade but we never had a big problem getting one. There was one day when I put a shirt and a water bottle on a table while I got in line for a burger and a man sat down, but he moved when we asked him to. As far as dinner, we did not go to any of the ala cartes, as I have one child who is the pickiest eater on the planet! The other family we met did eat at the Mexican ala carte at the Maya and said it was good. They also ate at the Viva caf\u00e9 in town (cost is an additional $10) and gave it good marks as well. The dinner buffet would be my only real complaint. As I mentioned, we had previously stayed at the Riu Playacar (and a Riu in the DR) & the IB* Paraiso, so maybe we were spoiled as far as what to expect for a dinner buffet. It was very small compared to the other ones we have experienced. Even though they had \u201ctheme nights\u201d there was never much variety. There was always pizza, fries, pasta and sauces, at least 3 different rice dishes, beans, several types of meats (chicken, beef & pork in different sauces), a carving station which always had fish and another type of meat, a fairly small salad/fruit bar, and a dessert area which never had more than 4 or 5 choices as well as 2 types of ice cream. The salad bar had very little in the way of choices, and usually not more than 2 other types of salads (pasta salad etc). I don\u2019t think I ever saw more than oil & vinegar set out for dressings, which seemed odd. But there was always mustard, mayo & ketchup! The hot dishes were usually labeled so it was easy to see what was what. What we ate tasted OK, it\u2019s just the lack of variety that I did not like. Plus the other places we stayed always seemed to have a section with traditional Mexican foods (tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, etc) as well as a \u201ckid-friendly\u201d area with chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes, fries, pizza, hot dogs & burgers etc. They only had \u201cpureed potatoes\u201d one night and they looked nasty! It seemed a good bit of the clientele were Italian, so maybe that is who they tend to favor. We did end up eating in town a couple nights and even ordered Papa John\u2019s pizza twice \u2013 the second night we called them and told them the resort name and our name they knew our room number which was too funny! And I hate to spend more when we\u2019ve paid for AI. Bottom line \u2013 B- grade Overall we enjoyed our stay. When we checked out my husband went to the front desk about an hour before our van was due since in the past we\u2019d had to wait quite a while to get thru the process, but they had everything ready for him when he got there. We weren\u2019t even charged for the few local calls we made. All the staff were always friendly, with at least a smile and \u201cHola!\u201d. The resort itself was always well-maintained. The shallow area of the pool had the sand removed from it several times daily. I never saw any trash lying around. The area around the snack bar was always kept clean \u2013 there were usually 2 workers bussing tables during lunch so you didn\u2019t have to wait to get a table once it was vacated. The animacion staff were always super friendly, sitting with guests when they would eat breakfast & lunch and making everyone feel welcome. The activities schedule was never \u201chard and fast\u201d \u2013 sometimes the 9:30 water aerobics would be at 11am, but there was always something fun going on. The kids did participate in some of the kids club activities and enjoyed themselves, but the schedule there was never set in stone either. My son was disappointed on our first full day when the printed schedule in our room said they were doing archery at 10:30 and it was darts instead but they did enjoy the things they did. Most of the kids who were at the kids club most of the day were the younger ones. My kids are 8 & 11 and we usually spend time with them. After all, if they are at the kids club all day it\u2019s not really a family vacation. If I want to vacation without the kids I\u2019ll leave them at home. I hope I haven\u2019t given too much info!

A perfect place to take your family on a dream come true vacation. Our family of 4 (my husband and myself and 2 teenage daughters ages 14 and 17) vacationed at the Azteca from 3/26/05 until 4/2/05. I cannot say enough about this wonderful resort. The grounds are beautiful and the layout of the resort is a nice design, everything flows and it never felt crowed during this busy Easter holiday week. We loved how the pool eating/bar area is elevated so that you can sit at a table and look out over the pool and the Caribbean Sea and palm trees. The weather was in the mid 80's each day, sunny and a constant tropical breeze. SERVICE: The service at the Azteca is truely impeccable. You are really pampered here. The drinks are outstanding and never long lines. The Mayan people are so warm and friendly and so eager to please you on your vacation. They do not look for tips but if you give them a dollar or two, they beam from ear to ear. CHECK IN: The lobby is gorgeous and makes a nice impression when you pull up. Check in was very efficient and no problems at all. ROOMS: The rooms are very pretty and spacious. The 4 of us were in one room and there was plenty of space. Large bathroom with nice tile from ceiling to floor. Long counter with plenty of room for all of us to put our things. Nice combination safe in the room. Maid service is excellent and we tipped every day. BEACH: Do not worry!!! There is still plenty of beach for you at the Azteca. I booked this trip 10 months ago back in May 2004. I worried myself sick for 3 months when I began reading about the erosion in early Jan 2005. Do not repeat this same mistake. The beach is fine and you will love it. Luckily, the Azteca had a huge beach to begin with so even though they lost some beach, there is still plenty to enjoy. The Allegro and Royal Hideaway got the worst of it and really have no beach. Azteca has plenty of lounge chairs in the shade and sun. Make sure to bring your own beach towels to lay over their towels to mark your chair. I got there by 7:00 am each morning to reserve my choice palapa. That was never a problem for me. I loved the peace and quiet and sipping coffee early at the pool bar after I saved my beach chairs. The water is unbelievably clear and a light turquiose color. We swam in the sea every day and it was fantastic. Took a wonderful walk down the beach each morning down to south end of Playacar resort complex to the Gala Resort which is the last one. It is a 40 minute round trip brisk walk down the beach. Azteca is at the north end of Playacar. POOL: Nice pool and we did the water aerobics. We tried the pool at night too with all the lights on and it was so pretty. They keep it open until 8:00 pm. ENTERTAINMENT: Great hardworking entertainment staff. Very friendly. At first we wanted no parts of the activities and just said no, but as the week went on, we were doing step aerobics, salsa dancing class, water aerobics. The same staff do the shows at night. Some we like more than others but the Latin Show is a must see. Beautiful costumes and dancing. Don't miss this one. Dance Alive was our 2nd favorite. These people work extremely hard. One told us 12.5 hour days and only one day off a week. FOOD: We loved the breakfast buffet (omelettes and eggs to order, sausage, bacon, french toast, pancakes, etc.) We ate lunch at the pool snack bar area which was fine. Wonderful fruit at every meal and great juices. The guacamole is to die for!!!! Chips and guacamole was my favorite food of the week!! Our favorite dinner was at Viva Mexico at the Viva Maya. Excellent chicken fajitas. La Scala at the Azteca was very fancy and fun to do. All the water is purified at the eating areas and restaurants and the ice cubes are made of purified water. The Apple rep, at our orientation, said not to drink the tap water in the room and we used bottled water to brush our teeth. No one got sick. This bottled purified water is in fridge in room and on tap at all eating places. SHOPPING VILLAGE: We loved the shopping village in the Playacar resort complex. We must have walked there 4 nights in a row. Pretty shops with reasonable prices. It is a pretty walk down the palm tree lined sidewalk past the other resorts at night which all have pretty lit up entrances. All in all, the Viva Wyndham Azteca is a wonderful resort. It had the nicest group of people all from different countries (I'd say Italian, German, Canadian, and U.S about 1/4 of each). This is a very low key and relaxing resort. A wonderful place to take your family.", "Date": "April 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMoney well spent\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3308427", "Content": "Went for 7 days, March 19 to 26, 2005. Canadian March Break. A group of adults, no kids. Really enjoyed it. This place is well-reviewed already on tripadvisor. We read all the reviews prior to choosing. We were hesitant to commit here due to some reviews - construction concerns, disappearing beach, bland food, etc, etc. My opinion - this place is great. Don't expect 5 star service, because then you're setting yourself up for disappointment. If you can get 5 star service elsewhere at this price, pick the other place instead. You can expect terrific staff, good food (yes, it's a buffet attempting to cater to 500 people from N. America and Europe), very clean grounds and rooms. A la carte meals were good. There is really plenty of beach, if your intention is to jump around in the sea and then go back to the beach chairs and bake in the sun. As for construction, our room was right beside (i.e. 25 ft away) the construction. They're building a new resort next door. We didn't hear one construction sound all week, although workers were on site. We probably were lucky, but if you're an early riser, you'll be fine in any event. NOTE - there is purified water available everywhere, except for inside your hotel rooms. You have to brush your teeth with bottled water, not tap water. But no worries within the resort about Hepatitis A. Safe to eat salads, as they promise that they wash the food with purified water. Staff deserves a special mention - being food service, entertainment, cleaning and admin staff - they really do make an extra effort to be nice. They work very hard. They are attentive. Very pleased with the service. No exceptions. FYI - try to speak a little Spanish and you'll probably get a delighted smile and an impromptu language lesson. The strong point of this resort - it is small. Approx 250 rooms. High staff / guest ratio. You'll appreciate this after a couple of days. Despite our going during high season, we did not have to wait for anything - never waited to eat, to find a place to sit, entertainment, etc. Only shortage was on shaded beach or pool chairs (there is plenty of unshaded seating), but you can avoid this by getting down to the beach before 8.30 am. There were plenty of kids, and teenagers, around but this was not a noisy resort. Location is also very good. Resort is located within a large private, gated grounds. Probably 5 km long, end to end, consisting of many resorts, condo developments, luxury homes and a small shopping centre. Lovely grounds, feels very safe. You have to pass by a checkpoint before you can drive onto the grounds. This means there are really no locals around, but you can walk and visit the nearby town located beside / just outside this gated community. If you want to be picky, then points to criticize would be the food (buffet and a la carte) could be better; there could be more umbrellas available for beach and pool seating; and the night entertainment could be stronger. But my review is that this place is terrific.

Great choice for our first trip to Mexico! Everything worked out as planned - from transfers to room arrangements to resort facilities. We chose Viva Azteca because it is a bit smaller than other resorts and I thought they packed a lot into a smaller space. Plenty of beach chairs - no huge lines for drinks or food. I thought the food was decent - no one went hungry, thats for sure. We traveled with 2- 18 year olds and a 15 year old. The older teens hit it off with some Canadians and spent their evenings either at the disco there or at the Maya where they had beach dances. The 15 year old had fun with all the activities. like beach games and salsa dancing. The staff does a wonderful job with getting people involved and if you have little kids, I think their kids club does a fantastic job with the little ones. The beach does have some hurricane damage, but it is entirely usable and it will be interesting to see how it looks in a year or 2. There is a huge constuction site next door to the north, but for some reason they were not working the week we were there (Holy week?) but we did get a taste of the noise the first day we were there - it would be irritating. The resort is very international which we found refreshing but others may not. As Americans we felt in the minority, although quite a few folks were from Canada.

Overall very, very good vacation. People who write reviews should become a little more realistic as to what to expect when you travel to a place that caters to many other nationalities and stop nit picking every little thing. You can expect a very clean, friendly relaxing vacation when you book this Hotel. If you are looking for a BMW go to another hotel If you want a Camry you have the right place. The beach is almost gone. BIG DEAL. There is plenty of places to sit on the sand under shade or in the sun. It is not as crowded as some people make it out to be. Sit, soak up the sun and swim in the pool although during our stay we swam in the ocean most of the time. Food is very good. Loved La Scala and Bamboo. Did I like the Buffett everyday, no, because I do not like certain foods, but that does not mean it wasn't good. The restaurants were very good both at the Azteca and at the Maya. We also ate in town at the Viva Cafe and that was excellent, too. Rooms are plain. nothing fancy. Balconies were very narrow you could not sit on them but the basics were there and I did not come to Mexico to sit in my room. It was always clean, air conditioning worked perfectly. Shower was hot. Television had only three stations in english ( imagine not watching TV for eight days)you can survive. If the staff were any friendlier you would want to adopt them and take them home with you. The Hotel is geared to make sure you have fun and they succeed. It is a very quiet and small hotel(just what we wanted) where you do not hear loud noises from your neighbors at night and it is very comfortable. Biggest negative I had: is breakfast buffett was not always hot but if that becomes your biggest negitive you will only have a great time. Veronica and Ines at guest services went out of their way to make sure your every wish was fulfilled.They made reservations for us for at restaurants before we even arrived at the hotel.

I went with my mom (52) and my son who is 7. We went from February 19-26 and stayed at the Viva Azteca. This hotel states a 4 star star, and I think they should get a higher rating....The reason I went to this hotel is after reading the reviews, it seemed to be a family orientated hotel, which I wanted, and the fact that the price was really good for people with families. The children basically stay and eat free at this hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who has children. I have to stay this hotel is very well kept with awseome service. If there was a problem (like once our toilet wouldnt flush, we told them about it in the morning, and when we came back in the afternoon it was all fixed), it was dealt with very quickly. They really go out of their way to help you. When we arrived, we had slippers and robes waiting for us, with towel displays on our beds and I would have to say better than average rooms. The rooms were quiet large compared to the last place we stayed two years ago. There was always activites to participate in. Also, you could eat and play at the Viva Maya. I went to this hotel, and this place is beautiful also. I love the jungle there. I loved the fact that we were really close to the Plaza (5 minute walk), where you could go for a night walk and look at some of the shops, and also get picked up here if you wanted to do any excursions on your stay. Very close to Playa del Carmen, $5 taxi ride over if you wanted to go shopping. One thing I did notice is I was very sensitive to the food here. I don't know if they put too much oil in the food. I can't eat food with to much oil. The last place I stayed, I never got sick. This place I did after eating. The food tasted good, but my stomache didn't like it. The good thing is I lost some weight. I will have to try out this place again if I need to go on a diet....My son never got sick, and dessert was always on his plate. This was his second time in Mexico. The dj from the hotel (I loved the music played here), copied a disk with some of the music they played here. You just have to ask. It is a nice sovenier to take home and listen to. The night shows were really good, the children enjoyed them too. It is really hard to stay awake to go to them later though when you have been swimming all day, and walking along the beaches...Sitting in the sun is so exhausting! lol! True though, the sun makes you really tired. Relaxed, but tired. The shows were at 9:45pm, and we woke up at 7:00am every day.... Yes, I heard that it is hard to get a \"good\" spot to sit during the day by the pool. But who wants to sit buy the pool? I came to see and be by the beach! You can go to any pool at home. Even if you can't get a chair on the beach, just walk down and plop your towel on the sand. Many people just lied down on the sand...No biggy. You can just wash yourself off in the water....And that is really refeshing after lying in the sun.... Also, a photographer comes and takes pictures during the day by the beach at this hotel. They may bring birds one day, or an iguana the next for you to hold. Then he will take photos of you (you dont have to hold the animals). If you miss him, ask one of the staff. They can tell you when he will be back. You can request for him to take photos of you (and your family). At night, they show a slideshow of all the photos that were taken during the day. You can choose to purchase them if you really like them. I payed $7 US each. On the last day, I got him to take a whole bunch of me and my son. I brought them to work after I got back. People at work are amazed at the beauty of them. Expensive, but priceless. I loved the kids club, where children got to have their face painted, sand castle contests, and got to be in the shows at night. Which I was so happy about....Lots of europeans staying here, which made it hard for my son to talk to, but some spoke english, and my son made a really great friend on our stay. Also, they have pottery you can paint. My son painted a turtle. The turtle was $10 US. There are many other things you can paint. They put it in an oven, and the next day, it is all glazed with the colours you painted it. A nice sovenier to take back. All our actitives this time we arranged with the desk at the front. I would have to say this is the way to go if you want air condidtioned vehicles, and everything is taken care of. We swam with the dolphins at Puerta Aventuras, which was $99 US each. They give you life jackets, and scuba gear. You get to keep the snorkel tubes here. Me and my son loved this. This is a must do. We used the catamarans at our hotel, which was so fun. Also, my son enjoyed the bougy boards provided. So did I! I went on the Fat Cat Aventure tour by myself which was awsome. You go on this huge catamaran with 30 adults, all food and drinks provided, and sail to this private cove for snorkelling. They play tropical music on the way there. On the way back, you can try boom netting, where you hold on to this net at the back while the boating is driving. Very fun. Think of water skiing but you are lying down on your back while holding onto nets attached to the boat. Don't loose your pants! Also, we went back to Xel Ha again this year. This time, we did the all-inclusive. When you go to this park, your snorkel gear, life jackets, locker and towel rental, and all your meals are included in the price with the all inclusive deal. You get to keep the snorkel tubes. Snorkeling is so fun. It was my son's first experience. Last time we went, we only expelored the jungle. This time, we snorkeled. I think you need at leat three days to explore everthing at this park. I love this park. I will come back everytime. We also went to Playa del Carmen at night. Actually, it is really nice to go at night. It is a lot cooler, and refreshing in a sense. During the day, it can get quiet hot, and at night, it is something fun to do. I have always enjoyed an evening walk. I spent a lot of my money on pictures taken by the photographers. But the pictures are so beautiful, and when you get home, you can always copy them. We walked along the beaches, where we got to see many other hotels. It is too bad that some of the beaches got a couple feet taken off from the hurrican last year. You can still walk along the beach, and enjoy the colour of the water. The sand is a different colour here. It is not as white as the colour of sand at Akumal Beach (where we were last time) Some tips would be to bring aloe gel if you burn easily, as it is very expensive here (along with the sunscreen). Also, bring a beach ball that you can blow up, as they are expensive here. Buy a couple bottles of vanilla (as I did), because they grow it here and it is much better. I have already used mine you you can really tell the difference. It smells so much better as well. Bring a peice of amber back, they sell it everywhere in Playa del Carmen, but make sure it is the real thing. When negotiating a price, dont settle for the first one. Bring batteries for you camera, and bring lots of film. Bring an underwater camera. Tip the maid. They don't make very much. Try: Horchata, a rice water drink. Very yummy! Try: The catamaran at the hotel Try: Walk to the sister hotel Viva Maya Try: Tamales at Playa del Carmen. So good!

I cannot complain. As you pack, keep in mind: There are only two drawers in the closet and the hangers are connected to the rod. I packed the kids' clothes in ziplocs which did happen to help, but still a lot of clutter. You may want to bring extra hangers. It wouldn't be a bad idea if they added some wall hooks or something to help relieve that problem. Anyway, the grounds and common areas are constantly being maintained and it is really pretty.

My advice: Buffets were great for the breakfast and lunch, and we did eat at the restaurants Bamboo (ok) La Scala (pretty good) and Viva Cafe (the best meal we'd had all week. The restaurants gave you a nice, \"I'm on vacation and being waited on\" feel as opposed to the buffet. The Viva Cafe charges extra, but was definitely worth it! I did my research on this site...and started to worry given some of the more recent reviews. As for construction noise, it wasn't too bad and it is only during the day. If you get a room in building A (rooms that start with 1) you're right next door;building B (where we were) rooms that start with 2, is as far away as possible. It really didn't affect our stay at all. I didn't really notice it too much near the pool or the sea---but then again, I had a 1 1/2 yo who did her share of crying. I did join the By Request and booked thru Wyndham's site (a prepaid,noncalleable reservation gave a discount....downside is there is NO refund if you need to cancel , yes a bit risky---or you could reserve without the prepay/discount) prior to booking. It seems that you do get a couple of nice perks as such, and the wristband you have to wear during your stay (not a big fan of this, kept scratching my baby with it by accident) indicates you as such...likewise the colors of the other bands seem to indicated what tour group you're with. Found the other guests to be really nice and friendly as well. We were one of a small number of American families, met a lot of people from Canada , Germany, Italy --all very nice and laid back. Again, given the area in which we live, that was a plus. Our son met so many kids from different countries and they all got along quite well. Also, the weather, predicted to be yucky turned out to be wonderful and in the 80's with a couple of showers. So don't let the forecasts worry you too much. Beware the VIP program, if you accept the gift you'll be doing their tours and they are quite aggressive. The guy who went after my husband, did lay off and was respectful....just be prepared that there are no \"free\" lunches: if someone offers you a gift, they want something in return. We would definitely go back to the Azteca with the kids.", "Date": "March 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingsport, Tennessee USA", "Title": "\u201cA pretty good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "kiskangel", "ReviewID": "UR3241502", "Content": "Just got back from stay at Wyndham Azteca.

It is much cozier and the staff I felt was friendlier. It depends what you want. It was just myself and my wife, so we would've liked either. It we'd had children I think Azteca would've been better. The room itself definitely needed improvement at Azteca, quite plain compared to Moon Palace. I liked being at Azteca in that its close enough to playa del carmen you can easily walk to town in 15 minutes and thats fun for a day.

All of the restaurants are good, and personally, i thought the buffet was good too. The beach was very nice, there was about a six foot drop off to get down to the water, but that is not the azteca's fault, there was a hurricane there in october and it wiped away a lot of the beach. There is still plenty of room. Whoever complains about the alcohol being watered down needs to give it a rest. Every all inclusive i've ever heard of has watered down drinks, and whats the difference, they still taste fine and you can have as many as you want. Thats why it is called all-inclusive. Any other complaints you might hear about the azteca are dumb, if all you focus on are the bad things with your vacation, you are bound to have a crappy time.

I booked at the Azteca from the many positive reviews I read on this website...I was very disappointed. FYI, we are Wyndham by Request members. Upon check-in, we were greeted with drinks (NA). The woman assisting us informed me that they only had confirmed reservations for two and not four (two children, 7 and 12). They said it was a problem with Travelocity-a problem that occurs all the time-so we may need to pay more money. I showed all my paperwork and credit card statement showing what I had paid. She put a wristband on my husband and myself and told us all to go to the buffet and come back in 1/2 an hour and that everything would be taken care of. We went to the buffet and almost died (just my husband and I, the kids were fine with fries and pizza). Compared to other AI's we have been to, there were fewer items to choose from. Everything was overcooked--I mean chicken that was like rubber, dry fish, dry pork, burned bacon, pancakes heavy as lead, etc. There was hardly any variety. After our lunch we returned to the front desk to find out the staff had done nothing to help the situation. Again, I showed my paperwork and they said they needed to get a fax from Travelocity. I had to call and speak with a Travelocity rep who then faxed the same paper I had just shown them. The grounds are kept OK, but if you are looking for a lot of flowers or pretty locations to take photos, it will be hard to find on the Azteca grounds. Our room was very small. There was barely enough room for all of us and our luggage. My husband likes to watch TV while getting ready and when he is ready for bed, so he couldn't stand the fact that the TV made this terribly loud humming sound the entire time it was on. The reception came in and out, but for the most part came in with lines through the middle. Since we are W by R members, we did get a balloon and drinks in our room with a plate of fruit. Also, a bottle of Andre...as all the alcohol is very bottom-shelf. The drinks were bad. Hardly any alcohol, even if you asked for more (and spoke Spanish) We tried a bunch our first afternoon and would take two sips, realize we hated it and would move on. Probably the best drink was a NA on that they list on the first page of the drink menu. I forget the exact name but it had Especial in the title. We ate in La Scala, which was the best meal we had while on the grounds. DO NOT order the Ceasar salad. You could hardly see the lettuce through all of the dressing...and I really like salad dressing...also, the dressing was just like mayo. Our deserts were tasty. If you would like a chair by the pool, be prepared to scope out a spot by at least 6:15, although the towel station does not open until 7. Many people do not return their towels and save their chairs very early in the morning-although many of the chairs remain empty (except for the towel) all day long. The towel guy was late most mornings and once he was there, but the towels weren't until 7:30. The beach is gone and there are sandbags everywhere. The sand is full of rocks and twigs. To sum it up, our children had a great time being exposed to people of many different cultures, getting to swim and eat as many cheese fries as they could. My husband and I would not return to the Viva Azteca (or Maya, as we checked out that buffet, grounds, etc.) even if someone else was willing to foot our bill. There are many other resorts in the area and as someone with good taste, I strongly suggest you stay at one of those.

I personally love eating outside and some of the tables were set up outside like on a piazza (square) in Italy with a waterfountain and beautiful trees. I could just sit there forever. You could also eat inside. We also ate at a la carte restaurants: Portofino ( at Maya), La Scala and Bamboo. Portofino was absolutely best. High quality meal and wonderful service. We went twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. At La Scala the food was good ( my husband recommends beef tenderloin- he ordered medium rare and it was perfect ), but the service was not as good ( maybe seemed not so great compared to Portofino, other people who ate there seemed satisfied). Bamboo was OK. THe beach was great. Hurricane Ivan did some damage to it, but if you sit under a palapa then you have a front row seat and can enjoy a breathtaking view of the sea. Since being in the shade is important for us, that worked out well for us. There were always plenty of loungers available both in the shade and in the sun. The beach was cleaned daily.Beautiful sand and color of water. You never had to wait in line for anything and it never felt too crowded. We rented catamarans and kayaks. Never waited longer than 20-30 min. to get one, altough if it was too windy and too dangerous then watersports were cancelled. The POOL was never crowded, but the water there was cool. I swim laps so it was OK for me, but my husband did not attend scuba lesson due to cold water in the pool. Are any other resorts heating water in the pool? Our room was fine. Very clean and tastfully decorated. Everything worked fine. We had a king size bed and found it comfortable. Cleaning staff did a great job and we had different towel arrangement each day. THe beach bar is open 24h. Quite a few people thought it was a bad thing, as it was noisy for a few nights. Most of the time we slept well anyways ( had to close the balcony). I enjoyed different non alcoholic cocktails ( 8 to choose from), and other people commented that the drinks were very strong. We walked to Playa del Carmen a few times ( daytime, evening).

Stretching session on the beach with Christina was good and well planned. Wateraerobics with enthusiastic Patricia was OK. I had to make it more intense for myself, but it was fun and at adequate level for a mixed group. Overall we had a great time. The place is well designed. Everything is close yet one area does not interefere with another.

This is a small resort (200 rooms or so) with an international flair. Many visitors from Canada, US, Mexico and Europe. Although English was NOT a dominant language, our family treated this as a positive to work on our spanish and meet others from different cultures. When needed, there was always staff nearby who spoke and understood English, so communicating our every want and desire was never a problem. Although we had requested and reconfirmed oceanview Connecting Rooms months in advance, amazingly, upon check-in, we were sent to non-connecting rooms. After complaining, they remedied the situation by providing us connecting Garden View Rooms. The next day we were provided the connecting ocean view rooms (which actually turned out to be oceanfront with balconies - An amazingly beautiful view). This inconvenience didn't spoil our stay, but is worth noting. The management or administration at Wyndham must have really screwed up. I made this request when I booked the room, and they told me that they would accomodate this request. I later reconfirmed this request, which they acknowledged. AND it was still wrong ! The housekeeping staff must be commended though, as they provided two cleanings per day with turn-down service. Muy Bueno ! The food was generous with generally good quality. Meals were mostly provided by the restauant buffet open for breakfast lunch and dinner, and four upscale dinner restaurants offered by the Viva Azteca and Viva Maya (which is a few minutes walk on the resort lined street). (The Viva Cafe, located in downtown Playa Del Carmen is evidently also part of the All-Inclusive however, our family did not have the chance to go there). Reservations at these restaurants are a must, and it is recommended you address this early in your stay (or maybe contacting the hotel in advance of your stay). It was occasionally difficult to obtain a reservation for the restaurant we wanted, but overall, we ate at three of these specialty restaurants, as well as the buffet at the Azteca and the Buffet at the Maya on the other two evenings. The dinner highlight was Portofino at the Maya, and the lowlight was the Maya Buffet. The staff at the Azteca was great, especially the bartenders, who were willing to mix whatever requested, and always with a smile. The activity staff was also great, with the kids club (Marta was great) providing activities to keep the little ones busy, and an equally strong group (Yonathan and Jaime were especially good) trying to keep the adults from gaining too much weight. The lit tennis courts were of especially nice condition. Tennis racquets and balls are provided by the resort. The Maya seemed to have more activities, however our family enjoyed the quaintness of the Azteca. I was going back and forth whether we should have booked at the Maya, but settled on being happy with what we had, even if it seemed quiet at times, knowing that my kids weren't too far away, and the quiet poolside was often appreciated. The one downside seemed to be the lack of activities after 4PM or so. There was dinner of course, and a show began at 9:45. However, since my kids couldn't stay up late enough for the show (and I have to admit, I didn't mind getting shut eye by 10PM), there seemed to be a lull. Other all-inclusives show a movie or have activities right up to their evening shows/entertainment. The lack of early evening activities was very apparent to our family.

There were a lot of things to like about the resort. First, our room had a terrific view of the beach! It was so wonderful to wake up early and watch the sun rise over the sea. There is always a nice breeze and it's very refreshing. If you can, ask for either rooms 1201 or 1301, they have amazing views. The staff was great. They always made sure we were taken care of and they were very friendly. The safe in our room wasn't working properly so we called the front desk. Within 5 minutes a nice man came up and fixed it for us. As for the food, I'd say it was very good. During our stay we opted to eat at the buffet for all of our meals so I can't really comment on the restaurants. However, the buffet offered a nice variety and always had something I enjoyed (and I'm a picky eater!). If you choose the buffet, I recommend getting there early before the food has been sitting around too long. It is in an open-aired building and there can be insects (and we even saw a gecko crawling on the ceiling!). There are a few stray cats around but for our entire stay we never saw them go into the building. They pretty much stay out in the courtyard and many people (including me) threw them a few scraps. The staff is very quick to bring you a fresh drink or take your finished plates. As for drinks, each day you get 2 Cokes, 2 Sprites and 2 bottled waters in your room's fridge. You also get unlimited drinks (alcohol too!) throughout the resort. The mixed drinks were pretty good but I preferred the Dos Equis beer. There is a very international feel because there are people from just about everywhere. Germany, Italy, South America, Canada, England & the US to name just a few. It was a great experience for someone like me who had never been out of the country before. The rooms themselves are nice but they are lacking a few basic needs. There is no alarm clock (they provide wake up calls, they actually show up at your door in the morning!). They DO NOT accept prepaid calling cards on their phones. There is no documentation of hotel phone numbers or room features. The towels are indeed folded in a new shape every day which is nice. There aren't a lot of TV stations in the room but Americans will be happy to know that you do get ESPN and TNT so there is some english programming. One thing to beware of is the little card you will receive in your room that says \"come to the front desk and receive your free gift\". Your \"free gift\" is nothing more than a tiny sombrero and you only receive it after listening to a sales presentation. The woman does not easily take no for an answer, we had to decline her offer for a 90 minute sales presentation several times! Other than that minor problem, we very much enjoyed our stay at Azteca and would definitely go back again. One other note, we took two tours during our stay and both were wonderful. We booked them both through the hotel. We went to see the Mayan ruins in Tulum (costs $45, they are up on this cliff overlooking the sea, you MUST see it to believe it!) and also to the eco-park called Xcaret ($75). Xcaret is one of the most amazing places I've ever seen. All kinds of exotic animals and even a huge area with butterflies.

The food was plenty and just average. The Azteca has two restaurants in it, and 3 others to choose from. Viva Cafe to me was the best try an early reservation and then take a stroll in the area very lively at night. The hotel grounds are very beautiful, the sister hotel Maya seems to be under construction and the grounds were not as pleasant as the Azteca, the drinks were stronger though. The Azteca has a big beautiful pool, the pool bar could be better located though. The beach and watersports are right there. If you get a oceanview room it does not mean you will see the ocean from your room without much effort from yourself, recommend not staying on the ground floor.

Upon arrival after waking up at 5am to catch a 6:55 flight and traveling for 6 hrs. including planes and waiting in a hot airport transport van for 30 minutes before making another 45 min trip to playa del carmen, we were told that they had NO ROOMS for us. We specifically chose this hotel because of all the reviews we read about it being more relaxed than the viva maya.. Well, after 30 minutes of excuses by the desk staff, we were sent by taxi to the viva maya against our wills. Not the kind of greeting we expected! Luckily my wife speaks fluent spanish and I speak elementary level so we knew what was going on all the time. The room at the maya was sub-par. Dirty blacked marred walls in our beach view room that was obscured at best. Crappy cable tv and and unconfortable bed rounded out the package... We spent half our first day negotiating a suitable comp for our troubles.. We got a moonlight massage from the spa which was really the only redeeming part of the whole mess.. I do highly recommend this for couples to get on the beach at sunset!! Stay away from the VIP pitch.. it is time share! we did and trust me, you should also!! I heard bad things about that. The buffet at the maya was atrocious.. Birds taking dumps on the floor and picking fruit and other items right from the buffet serving tables.. NO LIE!! Food was pretty bad.. The viva Azteca's buffet was better tasting food but had stray cats wandering around begging for scraps. The pluses you ask??? Beach at both resorts are fantastic but get there early to get a good spot under a hut otherwise you'll bake in the 98degree sun. Visit Xel-Ha all day if you can, that was wonderful. Tulum is very scenic if you like mayan history but it is hot.. Portofino at Maya was best resturaunt/food we had although I had a stomach ache the next day on the way home that lasted 4 days.. Not the greatest vacation my wife and I could have taken.. Universal Studios in Orlando was better here in the states.. We wanted the beach this time and picked a bad apple.. Bottom Line, Azteca is better of the two.

First of all the hotel is gorgeous and well maintained and manicured. This region of Mexico ,we are told, would not allow over a three story building, the results of which are a beach without all those hi-rises and big gaudy hotels. It was also family oriented, with activities for kids as well as our rooms being very quiet at night for sleeping. The rooms are average, but clean and they restock the mini frige with soda and water that were included, so use them. We realized that bath towels were in short supply when your rooms are made up, so we asked for extra towels that always seem arrive to our room later in the day. The main bar is open 24 hours a day, the poolside bar till 1:oo am. We never waited more that one person in line to get a drink, which included top shelf liquor if you requested. The bartenders were great and often remember your preferences. The staff would tell you when a activity was starting but were not pushy, you really got the impression that they wanted you to really enjoy yourself by allowing you to do whatever you wanted. The food was great with plenty of choices, there were themes at night, Italian, French, Mexican... as well as the usual fare you would expect on a buffet. LA Scala was nice for a change, but don't expect much from the Air-conditioning in there. The Beach is the best. Great white sand and plenty of palm trees and cabanas sprinkled around for shade. Get out there by 7:30 and place towels or such to reserve your cabana if you want one for the day, they go fast. There was plenty of lounge chairs to go around all day long. Please note that some european women save money by only purshasing the bottom half or their swimsuits, Ha HA! I'm sure my twelve year old will be mentioning that to his friends stateside. Expect to be a minority if you are American. We found mostly Europeans on our visit, A great experience for all of us to realize that we share the planet with many others. All the activites were as descibed and those who wish to do the motorized sports had only to sign up and pay right on the beach and they would pick you up and jet ski you to the activity nearby. The pool was wonderful, sometimes warmer then you might like it for a cool down, however the ocean temp was perfect for that. All in all it was the little things that made it special. The feeling that you got more then you expected, when was the last time you said that! We also took the Xel-Ha day trip. Could have spent two whole days there alone.

Great hotel, staff is very accomodating. I just wish the place believed in air conditioning. It's hard to eat when you can hardly breath because of the humidity. Not many Americans, so the food was geared toward Europeans. The LaScala was the best restaurant. Try the Lasagna. The tenderloin was tough. The open air buffet seems common to the area, but when I stop swimming to eat I like to be cool. Stay away from the VIP office, it's just a time share pitch. ($22,000) You should use the excursion hostess only if you want to take an outside trip. You save a few bucks by setting it up yourself. Don't take the Tulum/Xel-Ha trip. Tulum is hot as hell. Xel-Ha is fantastic but you'll want to spend the whole day there. Do the all inclusive at Xel-Ha. If you take the combined trip you'll only be at Xel-Ha for 4 hours and one of them is spent waiting in line for your snorkeling gear because all the tour buses get there at the same time. The tour buses are tourist traps. You give a deposit at your hotel and then they stop at the place where you pay the rest, in the back of a souvenir show. Then on the way home they asked if we wanted to stop at another roadside shop. I was in the back of the bus, no hands went up, we stopped anyway. The souvenir shops in Playacar, walking distance from the hotel is a better deal. The price for the hotel transportation went from 42 per person to 30 by the time I got there.

We could not have asked for much more for the price! We checked in a bit early and they offered us a cocktail upon arrival and showed us to the lunch buffet. The food was ok, but not great. Very little mexican food - at least as Americans know it. The property advertises that there are several restaurants at the resort. Those restaurants are for dinner ONLY and you cannot eat in those restaurants whenever the urge strikes. You must make a reservation that morning and t is difficult to get a spot in any of them! We particulary enjoyed the Mediterranean restaurant and thought the service was OUTSTANDING! However, most nights we ended up eating at the buffet. The rooms were clean and nice, but do not come with shampoos and soaps and washcloths. Be sure to ask the front desk for washcloths and look on the wall in the bathroom for the dual soap/shampoo dispenser! Our room was garden view with a french balcony - please note that a French balcony is literally 2 feet in width from the sliding glass doors (a chair is too wide to sit on the balcony.) So standing room only on a French balcony. The resort staff members do speak English, but not well as we had imagined. We were also pleasantly surprised to be in the company of so many Europeans - the staff and guests speak English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and who knows what else! It was such a wonderful experience to be surrounded by such a diverse group of travellers. The beach is absolutely gorgeous and the staff works hard to keep it clean and combed. The beach is topless, so Americans with families please take note. The resort staff (housekeeping, activity leaders, wait staff, and all) were INCREDIBLY accommodating and happy to help us with anything we needed - they really made our vacation enjoyable. They are beautiful people!! The resort offers lots of fun activities throughout the day and night - a dart competition (with a fun spin!), volleyball, soccer, salsa lessons by the pool, and SO much more. I even learned how to \"drive\" a catamaran! The town of Playa del Carmen is lovely and shopping on 5th Avenue was quite an experience. We did not walk and really don't recommend it. We took two cabs a day it seemed, but they were very reasonably priced and all of our drivers were very friendly and nice. They do drive VERY fast, however. Please be sure to establish your cab fare BEFORE you enter the car. Speaking a little Spanish in Playa del Carmen really goes a long way.
