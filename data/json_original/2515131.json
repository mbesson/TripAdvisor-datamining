Super location right off 405, but minutes to I-5 and airport, as well as South Center mall, which the hotel shuttle will gladly take you to for shopping and dining options. Hotel shuttle also took us to return rental car the night before it was due to avoid rushing in the morning. Rooms are GORGEOUS, clean, and beautifully decorated with full kitchens including everything one needs to set up house: utensils, dinnerware, even dishtowels/potholders. Property has beautiful landscaping and HOT breakfast all days AND DINNER with beer/wine on weekdays. I'm talking FULL, hot dinner with free drinks. Fireplace and flatscreen inside, quaint table seating on patio weather permitting. Staff is SUPER friendly, and we've dealt with folks mid day, late night, and 4 a.m. Can't beat this place. We'll never go anywhere else when we're flying in/out of Seattle, and it's so good, we stay here even while touring Seattle/Tacoma attractions during our trip. We're pleasure travelers, but the mainly business clientele seem to feel the same way, and there are always a few families with kids sprinkled into the mix.

I am a Diamond level Honors member so I always try to pick a Hilton property when traveling on business. The hotel is a short 7 minute drive from SeaTac......unless you hit rush hours!! Seattle traffic is miserable and it could take up to 30-40 minutes during the evening rush. If coming from the airport during the evening rush I suggest taking International Drive north to Southcenter Drive. This detour will save you plenty of time and aggravation. The hotel sits in a park-like setting with all of the rooms occupying 5 or 6 out buildings. There is no airport noise and the rooms are generally quiet. The suites are large and well appointed with a full size 'fridge, stove and sink. Not too much to add that hasn't already been stated so I will move on to the only complaint I have about this property......the Internet. Both the wired and wireless access to the internet is horrific at best. This is a MAJOR pet peeve of mine. In the past year I have frequented many hotels (Hilton and others) who claim to provide free \"high-speed\" internet when the truth is that it is slower than a dial-up connection. I used Speed Test dot net to test the speed and repeatedly recorded download speeds in the .25-.35 MBPS range. I would rather the hotel not offer internet rather than be subjected to inferior results. The staff was awesome, especially the hostess's at the nightly dinner buffet. With the exception of the baked potato's and chili, the nightly offerings were delightful. All in all, a very nice property. I will return if my business takes me to the Seattle area again.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cNice and clean\u201d", "Author": "MaMa6363", "ReviewID": "UR123432060", "Content": "This place was perfect for my family of 5. very spacious and clean. we had to check in because our electricity was out due to that ice storm we had so the full kitchen was great. it had moat of the things we needed and if it didn't, the front dear staff was happy to provide. the staff was also very friendly and helpful.

We are very loyal to Homewood Suites and until now have never had a problem. They have always been well managed and a great value. This Hotel was a huge let down from our previous experiences with Homewood Suites. The first night was ok, but the manager acted as though we did not have a reservation by saying here is what we have left. We made reservations for both nights far in advance. Then came our second night's stay and I don't know where to begin. The problems started at checkin. We were early as we had no control over when we left our ship. We arrived at the hotel at around 1:00 pm and were told no rooms were available yet. When I asked how long it would take to get a roome ready for us I was rudely told \"Check-in time is 3:00. No offer was made to try to accomodate us. Again acting a though we did not have a reservation we were told here is what we have left. When we arrived back at the hotel at around 3:00 the room was ready, but not what we had reserved. It was 2 double beds. We reserved a king bed room. The hinge on diswasher was broken and the door almost fell off when we first opened it. The clock in the bedroom didn't seem to be lit so you could see the time at night. They overcharged us for the room saying it was an upgrade, although we were not informed of this up front. They did refund the difference after my wife complained and showed them our reservation amount. The topper was when we went to our car the next morning, we found a note stating we were parked illegally and our car was going to be towed, because we were never provided a card to put on our dashboard. When we brought up all of the problems we had with the management of the hotel they did offer to refund our second night's stay.

The kids always love the serve yourself breakfast with waffles, eggs and hot food as well as cold cereals and rolls and my young teen in particular loves to make her own iced coffees with the premium creamers, etc. There were a few really nice things about this particular stay and a few challenges. The Good: Always a great price for dependable xtras... a good pool, evening food, morning breakfast, good coffee, kitchen in the room, quietness, beautiful grounds with private feel of entrances with the building design and arrangements. Beds were pretty comfortable and my husband and I good a good sleep. Front desk was friendly and check in and out were efficient. The walking path was a-w-e-s-o-m-e. My husband and I walked far every evening, past light industrial area, across the river, soccer fields, parks, etc. Safe and well maintained paved path. A lot of other bike rides and walkers; it was quite nice and didn't hurt that the weather was perfect. The ok: There were a lot of young adults staying when we were there for a week. They were outside the pool, in the pool, doing a lot of drinking, etc. They were not drunk or unruly but there was a lot of profanity I would have prefered my 8 year old NOT hear rather than hear. Still, not too big a deal. Oh, and the Jacuzzi wasn't closed, but it wasn't getting above luke-warm. And thelaundry was useful but the partying guys that were there didn't always come get their wash when it was done so there was a lot of waiting for someone to move their stuff. The unfortunate: When we got there the first night we pulled out the sofa sleeper for the kids. It was dirty... It looked like someone had eated a crunchy chocolate chip cookie on the sheets, and the mattress pad was older than the one my great grandma used to use on her guest bed -- didn't even fit over the matress actually. I called the front desk and they said they did not have rollaway beds, but they would send someone to change the sheets. We had to check a few times with the front desk throughout the evening until Housekeeping finally came. They did change the sheets and pad, but not much they could do with the sad mattress that really needs to be replaced... very worn, thin and lumpy. I asked if we could move to a larger room or even rent an additional room with an adequate bed but apparently they were all sold out every night that week we were staying. My daughter slept in the livingroom chair for that week. The front desk clerk called and spoke to my husband later that night and offerend a $25 credit as an apology for each night we had booked there, which was nice but it never showed up on our bill or on our credit card.

I was pleased to get a Habitat-for-Humanity rate, which, as stated, promised $5 a night to that worthy organization. I booked a king fireplace suite and the room was spacious and clean (not spotless). Balcony overlooked the Green River, which truly isn't much to look at, but beats staring at a parking lot or busy street. The room was like a small apartment. Bed comfortable. Bathroom spacious and loved having toilet/shower in separate room. Having a mini kitchen was nice, even though the utensils and cooking supplies kind of limited. (Did not plan on making gourmet meals, so this was fine!) High-speed internet was nice, but not speedy quick. I did stream several movies on my computer without issue. Things to be aware of: Parking very limited for rooms towards the front of hotel by lobby. I had difficulty finding nearby parking even early in the evening. Sometimes I had to park on the opposite side of hotel. I worked very early and late shifts while I was in town and as a solo woman traveler I found walking through dark parking lots a little precarious. Most of the lots are lit fairly well, but still a little creepy. Train noise from nearby tracks is atrocious. Trains often made my whole room shake. The tracks get A LOT of use. I thought it was odd that the fireplace suite had a Duraflame log and wasn't a gas fireplace. Perhaps there is a rule about gas fireplaces in hotel rooms, I don't know. I do know that I was mighty disappointed to not be able to turn on the fireplace for 20 minutes on a cold, wet day to warm me up! Those Duraflames burn for awhile and I didn't want to fool with all that. There is a soccer complex next to the hotel which gets a lot of traffic. A lot of soccer players stay at this Homewood for tournaments and there can be a lot of teenagers - frequently unsupervised, it seemed to me - running around and making noise. Not the hotel's fault, of course, but be advised! Location kind of odd, but close enough to mall area without being too close. I had no problems with any front desk staff, in fact they were all very courteous. I would stay here again for business purposes, but for pleasure I'd find a great hotel downtown.

This hotel is very aware of the break-in probelms that occur in their parking lot, but have not make any steps in which to thwart off potential break-ins, such as security cameras, fences/gates around their property that admit only registered guests with keys or on-site security officers. It is very upsetting to know that break-ins occur on a fairly regular basis at this hotel and yet the hotel itself has done nothing to prevent such incidents. This incident cost me approximately $600 for the damange to my vehicle and a loss of over $200 worth of items removed from my truck. I do not recommend staying at this hotel.", "Date": "December 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Great Place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5469453", "Content": "Stayed here for 4 nights and found the this Homewood Suites absolutely great.
