The reception staff allocated us room 1413, a two bed apartment. The bedrooms were cramped as was the single bathroom. Although this may have been ok for a family, we have reached he stage where we like or own en suite, due to frequent nocturnal visits. The other couple felt the same, so, before unpacking, we returned to reception to enquire if perhaps we could each have rooms with ensuite. Big mistake. The male receptionist told us that nothing was available and even if it had been, we would still have to pay for the room we had been given. His manner was bordering on offensive, and when I commented that I found his attitude aggressive and not to be expected in a 5 star hotel, he replied,'It's not, this is a four and a half star hotel'. On returning to our room I dug out the print out I had downloaded about the hotel which did indeed give it five stars. I returned to the receptio area to show it to the receptionist, who said, 'where did you get that? It is wrong! where did it come from?' I replied that I had downloaded it from google. He replied, 'well, it's wrong'. It wasn't until I had gone back to our room and read the small print about the hotel i saw it had been submitted by the owner, but left it at that and all decided that due to the above treatment, we would spend nothing in the hotel.

We found Sydney cheaper than Melbourne but Oz is still expensive, so we tended to eat in more and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a large supermarket and booze shop, very important, a few blocks up George Street. The hotel entrance is a bit sanitary and reception wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over friendly, by Australian standards but we got what we wanted there and the rooftop pool was outstanding, although other skyscrapers did shadow it, in the late afternoon. However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d contracted a septic toe, so I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it or have a dip at Bondi Beach, much to my disappointment but our involvement with the Australian Medicare system was pleasant, plenty of Health Centres about and we got a refund on some of the cash we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d spent, well worth knowing about the refund. The hotel situation was superb, most places were within a few minutes walk and there was a Wally Tourist bus stop nearby, in the morning the tourist bus would be full by the time it got past there, so it was a good situation. We met a friend in Katoomba, in the Blue Mountains and instead of getting an expensive tourist bus we bought a ticket at Wynyard Street Station, just across the road which covered, the metro, the train and the Katoomba Tourist Bus, terrific value. Also, you can buy day passes for the ferries and public transport at Circular Quay, where the huge liners pull in and we loved the Rocks area, although never did find the craft brewery we spent ages looking for and we did feel very safe wondering about the main areas in the city. Our only major complaint about the hotel, apart from the fact I kept on tripping over the small step into the bathroom, was the usual one of big chains charging for WiFi, we saw a poor woman sweating over how to get onto her iPad, in reception and paying through the nose for it. As usual, there are plenty of places who are glad of your custom and let you have free access. Our favourite was the Grand, about 50 yards diagonally across Australia Square, a busy bustling square favoured by the office workers, early doors. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try the restaurant at the Grand but the bar was like an old UK one with wood panelling, friendly staff, reasonably priced beer by Oz standards and easily accessed WiFi, the only thing that surprised us was, it shut on a Sunday, bit like Scotland when I was a lad.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Good Hotel albeit cramped.\u201d", "Author": "Alistair D", "ReviewID": "UR127852711", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights.

In my previous life I had booked this apartment often for clients - though admittedly a few years ago now and under a previous name Saville. Perhaps I was a little too hopeful thinking I could easily fit 4 adults and 2 young children in a 2 bedroom apartment, but I had expected it to be bigger. ie the portacot only just fitted into our room (but meant not being able to walk around the bed or use the desk) We were told the lounge had a sofa bed for my 2 year old but it didn't so they gave us a rollaway - which did not fit in the other room so kept it in the lounge taking up what little spare space we had even when folded up (and as a side issue was awful to lie on - ok for kids but would never put an adult on it) Bathroom was tiny tiny as well. Basically I think it needs a good makeover, it is very tired, a lick of paint, a very good clean could make a world of difference. Also small things like extra glasses in the room (we seemed to be constantly ringing to get things for the kitchen) On the plus side though the staff were very very pleasent and efficient, they could not be faulted at all (other than perhaps the cleaning staff could be trained up on how to get a room clean, small things like dusting, cleaning out hairs form previous guests, vacuuming the rooms and hallways of bugs ...) The location is also top notch - so close to everything like shopping, rocks/circular quay. There is a supermarket right across the road which was so handy to have, oh and Fratellis Fresh new CBD store just around the corner - exceptional! So whilst I would not stay here again for 5 nights with so many people (even just 4 adults would be cramped in my opinion) If they spruced the place up a bit, thought more carefully about the small things that matter, and improved their cleaning I would consider staying again with a smaller party due to location and staff.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tianjin, China", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "pilotss2001", "ReviewID": "UR125843909", "Content": "This is a pricey place but you are located in the center of everything.

Most of the poorer reviews were about outside noise and the quality of the rooms. However, we have no complaints. The hotel did exactly what it said on the tin - offered a decent apart-hotel right in the city centre. There's not much I would add that others have said before us other than BE SURE YOU REALLY WANT TO STAY BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CBD. This was a repeat visit to Sydney for me after nearly 20 years. Sydney is so much busier than I remembered and being bang in the middle of the CBD of course there would be more noise but I don't think we expected the crush of people during the day. And that's our fault really for not giving that some thought beforehand. Often when we left the hotel in the morning we were met by waves of people coming out of the train station and rushing along to work. And then the same in reverse at 5pm. On Friday and Saturday nights it is much noisier with music from clubs and therefore people out and about on the streets.

The check in was good, with a helpful Receptionist providing a map and information on nearest food stores. After that, it went downhill. We had a 1 bed studio apartment on the 5th floor. Lift only operates if you swipe your room card, but it doesn't always work first time. On exiting the lift we noticed the corridor carpets were badly stained and had bits of litter strewn about. As we approached our suite the carpets became even more worn & stained outside the Housekeeping Room where bleach had been dropped. Our suite had a view of a brick wall. The curtains were filthy dirty, as was the double glazed window, which did open onto a tiny Juliette balcony which looked down onto an alleyway between the Mantra and the bar next door. This alleyway was used by the skateboarders and was very noisy. The room was very dark, the kitchen area looked OK, but was very poorly equipped with only one tiny saucepan and an electric frying pan that looked as if dog food had been cooked in it and never cleaned - YUK!! The purpose of choosing the Mantra suite was to do a bit of self-catering on our month long trip but this was absolutely impossible given the poor facilities. The laundry facility in the bathroom was about the only thing that lived up to expectations, but the iron had been used too hot by a previous occupant and scorched our clothing. Housekeeping didn't show up till 3.45pm one day, we had just got back in after being out since 9.30 am. We asked if he could pop back in half an hour since we were using the bathroom. He told us he was finishing now, so gave us clean towels but we had to make our own bed.

This has a small kitchen with dishwasher and a washing machine with tumble drier in the bathroom. The kitchen was not fully equipped so we had to buy some stuff to keep us going. Housekeeping was done on a daily basis, which tended to involve making the bed, loading the dishwasher and putting in new towels and basic cleaning. I think they clean the room from top to bottom between guests. Our room overlooked George street on the 13th floor, with a tiny balcony, which you could probably drag a dining chair out to sit on, but it is very noisy. The rooms are not double glazed, so even though we were on the 13th floor, the road noise still managed to get through. We found Friday and Saturday nights particularly noisy, especially from the Establishment a 'trendy' bar a short walk away, as people spilled out of the front smoking and generally being noisy. Also they would hangout in the small alleyway between the Mantra building and the Establishment. Add this to the constant drone of traffic on George Street and the 'boy racers' with their oversized exhaust pipes cruising up and down George Street into the early hours, made for a noisy sleeping environment. I would recommend ear plugs if you are easily disturbed by noise as I am. I would have to say however, that not once was I disturbed by our neighbours, which would suggest soundproofing between rooms was very good. Shame they didn't put double glazing in! Our door was near the lifts so sometimes you would get people who would congregate and chat by the lifts after a night out, but overall they wouldn't be too much of a problem. There is a swimming pool on the 18th floor, although after a quick visit, it wasn't very big and had been taken over by a crowd who were using it and the BBQ located there as well, so didn't bother again. It probably isn't big enough to do much swimming, but if you fancy a little splash about and cool down it will be fine. The TV was limited, I know if you are on holiday, you aren't going to stay in and watch TV! Location wise, this property is very good being only a five minute walk to Circular Quay and the Rocks and a short walk to the main shopping areas. So for sightseeing it is well located. There are also a number of supermarkets located very close by. The closest being Woolworths in the Metcentre, but this was only open when the Metcentre was open. There is Coles at Wynyard which was open till quite late and a Coles Central with a Liquorland located on George Street & King Street so you can get groceries and milk easily. There is no free wi-fi. My view of this property is a little different from others as we had to live there, before we moved into our permanent home, rather than stay as a tourist. If you want somewhere that is very well located for your holidays then I would say go for this property. If you are intending to live there for a while and want something a little quieter, then I would suggest there maybe better serviced apartments to suit these needs.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bremerton, Washington", "Title": "\u201cMantra 2\u201d", "Author": "Wilson54420", "ReviewID": "UR123375040", "Content": "The hotel is very central and in an absolutely convenient location in Sydney.

The dryer didn't work until we had three visits from housekeeping and finally the door needed a hard tug to one side to get it to close and then it worked. The door covering the fridge didn't close properly, the remote control in the bedroom didn't work, and the kitchen lacked some necessary utensils. There was also some kind of water leakage in the car park basement, which caused quite a mess, luckily not on my car but on someones.

I got to reception before checkin time as I requested an early checkin and my room was ready so thought I was off to a great start. The disappointing bit was it took 20 minutes to check in with the assistant manager who was wearing a mantra tshirt(very unprofessional)! I work in the hotel industry so I was expecting to have to do a credit card imprint but as I dont have a credit card myself I asked if they can speak to my partner on the phone to do one with his and was told they would have to send him a fax to fill out and send back... Who has a home fax? i know I certainly dont! So then i asked to do a cash bond, which i know is pretty standard across the board and have stayed in other mantra properties and other sydney properties and have done the same and was met with a flat out NO.. She offered me no other alternatives only leaving me with the option of having a friend come and do it for me.. mind you this was already after 15 minutes of checking in had passed. So basically I was out $199 and had no hope of getting my hotel room and no where to sleep that night! Very stressed out by this time!! So after a friend came and did the imprint for me I was asked if it was just myself staying in the room and I said no it was booked for 2 people. My confirmation from my travel agent said two people but their paperwork didnt. So then I was asked to sign a NO PARTY POLICY. Are they serious? I am a 25 year old mother who was having a night away with my girl friend and I had to sign to say we wouldnt have a party! Fair enough if there was 4 of us but two people? All of this kept adding to the time! So after about half an hour got back to my car and had to move it to their carpark and realised we got no instructions on where to go so just had to read the sign at the carpark gate. Got to our room, which was really nice and very clean!To much furniture in such a small space! Went to look at the compendium to see where the A/C button was and it said to spress the button on the TV and the button would'nt work so had to call down and ask. The room had no deadlock on the our side of the door so I didn't feel very comforted knowing this. The next day went to reception and asked if i needed to get my car out of the carpark first and then checkout or could i checkout then and go get my car. She told me that was fine and checked my account was ok. She said it was al fine and to have a lovely day and took the keys off me. I still wasn't sure so asked if i needed the key in the lift to get to my car and she said \"oh yes take this and put it in the box\"... Didn'tt bother telling me where the box was and turned and walked away. Overall, worst service I have ever received!

Short stays have been in the studios and longer stays in the one bedroom apartments. It has several things going for it. All the rooms have a kitchen and washing/drying facilities, which is very useful. The studio is well equipped and bigger than the normal hotel room. A warning about the bathroom in the studios, though. They are VERY small. The door doesn't completely open because of the placement of the toilet, meaning a bit of contortion is required to get in. If you have any mobility limitation or are on the larger size, I'd give the studio a miss. Also, try to avoid rooms facing on to George St. Sydney is a noisy city at all hours of the night and rooms facing on to Bond St are marginally quieter. The rooms have always been clean and room service food, while limited, is OK. The price varies a lot but if you can get a studio around the $200 mark, it represents quite good value. The location is not bad, roughly equal distance from the shops, Darling Harbour and Circular Quay. The Wynyard train station (with direct trains to the airport) is only 5 mins away. Thus far the review is quite positive and for a holiday stay the Mantra is probably fine but, and it is a big but, I'll never stay here again for business and I would not recommend anyone do so if Internet connection is relevant to your work.

We were told as an afterthought that there are trolleys available. Not what you expect from a 4/4.5 star hotel. The parking which we were told was \"ample\" was charged at $50 a night. There were a total of six spaces allocated for hotel parking on five levels of parking. The rest were private or allocated to \"Club 19\". After a six hour drive, the last thing you want to do is scour for a park, then have to literally park against one wall, let your partner out, then ferry the bags over the car out one door as it was impossible to open both doors of the car - ie. the driver and the passenger cannot exit the car without pulling forward from the space and letting the passenger and bags out first. This is ridiculous for $50 a night - you would expect an appropriately sized, accessible car space for that money (even if it is in the city).

Also go to the IMAZ cinema which has the largest cinema screen in the world. We also visited the aquarium which was good.

Circular Quay, the Rocks, Darling Harbour and the Victoria Building were all just a ten to fifteen minute walk away. Our children are the first to complain if they are required to 'hike' any distance and there were certainly no complaints over the weekend.

The trip advisor ratings system doesn't allow you to mark a hotel as 'good' which I would have done in this case.

One never knows what to expect. The Mantra 2 Bond Street was a welcome sight after a 14-1/2 hours flight from Los Angeles. We had 4 rooms booked. Even though I had the most people in a room I had the smallest 2 bedroom however it was a very ample 2 bedroom (on the 11th floor). After reading previous reviews regarding bar noise I requested a higher floor for all rooms. No one complained about any noise. Our other 2 bedrooms were located on the 14th floor (larger room than ours and a larger bathroom and sitting area) and the 10th floor (similar to our room). The one bedroom suite was huge! All rooms were spacious and comfortable. The kitchenettes were a welcome sight for us each morning. We purchased food from a grocery store inside the Wynward station which was about a block away. We found Australia to be quite expensive and it was nice to be able to save money by preparing our own breakfasts. Our living room had a pull out sofa. The other 2 bedrooms had large and very comfortable beds. The bathroom however was very small. Between having the stacking washer and dryer it was a very cramped space. We did love having a washer and dryer and picked the Mantra for this reason. Internet was expensive. $27 for 24 hours of internet. Overpriced! We went across the street and bought an external internet modum for $40. Why a hotel finds it necessary to charge that much for internet is beyond me. The front desk staff was so-so. Some were very friendly and some were surly. Our housekeeper wasn't very friendly either. There is a food court across the street and down some stairs. We had lunch at that food court several times during our stay. Great variety and the food was actually tasty! Location was wonderful. Close to most of the attractions including Circular Quay, the Sydney Opera House, the Botanical Gardens, the Rocks area as well as the Sydney Bridge. We walked everywhere. We took the 555 to Chinatown once but for the most part we were so close to all the other attractions it was easier to walk and the weather was gorgeous and cool making walks pleasant.

Although it is detailed, I said I'd include a few additional tips that might help other families. Travelled as a family of 4, 2 adults, 11 year old boy + 7 year old girl. Booked via Trailfinders, which was about 10% cheaper then booking direct. Was EUR2,200 for 9 nights for a 2 bed room suite (not the junior, the slightly bigger one). I thought price was a little expensive. Location - great. We had originally looked at booking similar apartment hotels down at Darling Harbour and Liverpool street. These were approx. 20% cheaper, but if you afford it, this location is perfect for a 1st time visitor, especially those using Sydney Ferries. The Rocks is within walking distance, as is Opera House and Circular Quay. The free CBD bus (no. 555, every 10 mins) is about 100 metres outside the hotel front door. Great for getting up to Hyde Park/Townhall. Used it 6 times during our stay. Be warned, it can get caught in the very heavy traffic on George St, especially during building works at weekends. Assume it may not come for 20 mins, or may be full on arrival. Requested a high floor, and one facing onto Bond St, due to previous comments about noise at weekends. Got one of those 2 beds on the 11th floor, with a corner balcony facing onto George St. Noise was not as bad as expected, but I think the windows are only single glaze. Hotel was busy, and seemed to turn away a lot of guests without bookings especially at the weekend Booked a hire car via the hotel, which worked out well. Mid size was AUD108 approx, per day, which was a lot more expensive then booking directly. However, AVIS delivered the car (upgraded to a Toyota Prius) for me to collect from the hotel underground car park by 8am. I parked the car that evening back in the hotel car park at 11pm, and AVIS picked it up the following morning. Considering the hotel charges AUD50 per night for parking, as do most locations the nearby, the quoted rate seemed good considering I had no messing about with collecting the car/dropping it off the following day. Also despite driving approx. 275 kms, it only cost AUD16 to refill. The tolls seem a bit of a nightmare, but I will know in 2 months if I got it right! Internet is only available in the lobby, but they also have PC's there, and it costs $6 per hour. You can also print there, which deducts time off your balance. Note: There is an internet cafe across the road at Wynard train station (called Galaxy), where internet costs $2 for 30 mins, reducing down the more you use. I think hotels in Australia need to look at this, as this would generally by free all over Europe and the US,in my experience. Free newspapers are a nice plus! Food: The cafe downstairs seemed to charge a lot (example: $11 for a breakfast cereal+ fruit). However, it seemed busy. We used the Chinese restaurant across the road. A lot more expensive then those in UK/Ireland, and menu different. Also ordered, and then collected some pizzas from Pizza Hut at St Martin Place which is a 5 min walk. Would also recommend Woolworths in Metro centre, over Coles. Had more deals, but was still very expensive wnen compared to UK/Ireland. Rooms: AC in rooms. We only found the controls at the end of our holiday - located inside the main bedroom wardrobe. Washing machine/dryer very good. Note: They have plastic/paper recycling tubs on each floor, in the refuse collection room. Swimming pool = as per previous posters. Small, full with 2-3 families. But high views over Sydney sky scrapers. Kitchen was good, as was dishwasher. Small. Balconies were good, but the corner ones are very small. Staff - very good reception staff. Especially the night porter. No concierge. On the final day (Sunday afternoon), hailed a taxi outside to the airport. Used the tunnel, which meant we got there in about 30 mins. cost was AUD44, plus tip.

We stayed at the Mantra 2 Bond for a full week. Overall, the property offers excellent value as the location is top notch and the rooms are a good size and have great amenities like a full size kitchen and washer and dryer. Cleanliness: We had a studio for the week and it was cleaned daily. I couldn't figure out the schedule as some days the room would be cleaned in the morning and other times in the afternoon. You can probably call and try to arrange for your room to be cleaned sooner rather than later as house keeping seemed accommodating. Location: The location can't be beat. It's in CBD right by the Wynyard train station, but also an easy walk to Circular Quay, the Rocks and the Sydney Harbour Bridge/Opera House. We walked down to Chinatown and Darling Harbour almost every night and besides large crowds (it is the business district after all), it was easy and very safe. The weekends are quieter and less crowded. Rooms: We had some minor issues with the bathroom. I stubbed my toe in the dark forgetting there is a tiny step up. There is a drain in the main bathroom ( wet room style) which we realized was helpful because the shower can flood. In our room, the washing machine also leaked, so the drain was useful. Don't get me wrong, this was easy to overlook because I was in love with the Washer/Dryer in the room. We were able to do several loads of laundry during our stay and house keeping replaces the detergent if you need it. We loved the full kitchen set up also. They have mini bar items, but still lots of room for you to put your groceries or beverages as well. You can bring leftovers back to reheat. Service: Was excellent. The front desk was professional and quick to assist us with any needs. We used them for simple tasks like mailing post cards (stamps available at post across the street) or making change. Value: As mentioned, overall value is excellent. If you can -- avoid hiring a car or using the parking in the hotel. It was $50 a night and spaces are limited. Sleep Quality: is excellent.

The apartment (I stayed in a one bedroom apartment) was a good size, with entry hall (bathroom off this hall with laundry cupboard in bathroom), small kitchen, living room with dining table and a queen size bed room. The bathroom - only had a shower but good water supply and lovely shower products and a good hairdryer. The washing machine, dryer, ironing board, iron were all in a compact cupboard inside the bathroom I didn't check to see if washing machine powder was included (sorry!). The kitchen had a microwave, fridge, sink, dishwasher, pots/pans/cutlery/crockery etc for at least two people, stove top, oven, kettle, toaster. There was a full mini bar. The downside was there was only one tiny portion of long life milk in the fridge, enough for two cups of tea, but there is a 7 Eleven store about 50 metres from the hotel so milk could be got from there. The furnishings were lovely, in very good condition and felt quite opulent. Bedroom had a tv as well as another in the living area. A safe was inside the cupboard. Breakfasts were OK - continental style if you had it included in your room rate but a fuller menu for a la carte choice. The breakfast cafe had a very limited menu but there is also a good in-room dining service that was well priced. There aren't many restaurants located close to the hotel but taxis are always close by.

The main reason to stay at the Mantra 2 Bond St. is location. It is roughly 3 blocks to the Circular Quay (where you see the Harbor Bridge & Opera House) and 3 blocks to Darling Harbor (Great tourist spot, lotso of restaurants). I was traveling with my parents who are both in their 50s/60s and not in excellent shape for walking, but this was great walking distance to tourist attractions, restaurants, bus pick-ups for them. Also, our room was on a high enough floor that we didn't hear the traffic below. Room and amenities. Another great things about the Mantra is that most of the hotels I looked at in Sydney only slept 1 or 2 people to a room, but the Mantra came with 2 bedrooms, plus a sofa sleeper, kitchette, dishwasher, kitchen table, washer and dryer, 1 bathroom. My cousins stays in a room with 2 king beds, no kitchenette, and a private outdoor hottub on their balcony. I imagine this would be a good place to stay if you had little kids. The sofa sleeper was not comfortable for the 25 year old male in our group, so he put the cushion on the floor to sleep on it. There was a restaurant downstairs for breakfast but it felt more business-y. We picked up cereal and breakfast food at the nearby Cole's Grocery store and ate breakfast in. While we liked the room and it was generally clean, the phone was extrenely gross and dirty. It's not the Ritz, but we were comfortable here. There was an in-room blow dryer, but we got an extra one too. Service. I believe people might live in this building too. The front desk is quite small, no concierge service, didn't really seem to be the place to get advice on where to go / what to do. My dad got yelled at by the front desk when he called a second time to request towels. We thought maybe we were supposed to be washing our own towels in the washer/dryer, but found out that we had just gotten a crabby front desk worker. I wouldn't say we got poor service, but it just didn't seem to be a focal point here. What I liked Best about the Mantra: Location! Space! Kitchenette! Washer/Dryer!

I booked direct through the mantra, because it was no cheaper anywhere else, and I wanted to cut out the unnecessary 'middleman'. The One bedroom aptmt was booked out, so we opted for the one bedroom dlx. Our friends booked the executive studio. I can't stress how enjoyable our stay was!!! The staff kindly provided 2 portacots for us, free of charge (as we had 2 kids under 2 with us) Our room was spacious, clean, quiet and modern. In the morning, it was so nice and quiet and dark (with the curtains closed), that our kids slept in until after 8am! BONUS! I also saw our friends exec studio room, and that was just as nice. The kitchen had everything we needed. I strongly advise looking on google maps for grocery stores nearby the hotel, to save time finding a place to buy food items for your stay. Our balcony was narrow, and faced the building across from us, but I really didn't care. When I booked, I knew the apartment position probably wouldn't have views anyway. The balcony was basically so you could go outside. There's no room for chairs or anything. The mantra also had a gym and a lovely roof top pool. My main concern when booking, was LOCATION. I did DAYS of research, and this was the ONLY place I could find that had the perfect location for the right price (we were on a bit of a budget) When I say location, I mean that the apartment was located smack-bang in the middle of Darling harbour, the city,mall, and the ferry terminal. It was equal walking distance to each of these places. Perfect! If any of you love shopping, I was in awe of the David Jones shopping centre. I couldn't find it at first, and had to ask for directions, but if you go there, on one side of the road is about 8 levels of womens department store, and then on the other side of the road is about 8 levels of mens department store. I was in heaven! I also walked to the ferry with the kids, and took an easy trip over to Tooronga zoo. Was so easy to get there. And didn't take that long either.

Unfortunately, my recent stay contradicted my experience in the hotel the year before. First of all, I was made to wait for my room until 2:20pm (check-in is at 2pm) because there was a problem with key cutter, and when I finally got into my room I was a little put off by the muggy stench of the room. I went straight to the balcony to get some air in but when I tried to open both (slimline) doors they were both stuck and wouldn't open at all. And to top it, my view was in fact a brick wall and a half demolished building. Despite my growing annoyance, I then turned on the LCD TV to check out the news, thinking they would have CNN and Bloomberg (as indicated by their site) and all I had access to was Sky and Fox Sport. I specifically returned to this hotel for access to an opening window/door and these business TV channels, so of course I was not happy. I contacted the front desk and a concierge was sent up to check the door and he too had great difficulty trying to open the balcony doors. He managed one and said I had to open it with some technique. I'm still not sure why maintenance was not contacted by the concierge. To cut a long story short, I eventually cut my Saville stay to one night instead of 3, for the sheer fact that I couldn't stay in a hotel where the service and accomodations are certainly below the 4.5 star standard it claims to be (LCD TV or not). On my departure, reception didn't even bother asking why I was unhappy and moving to another hotel. This, I thought was quite disturbing.

There was some traffic noise, only to be expected in a big city. However Friday and Saturday nights were AWFUL!

Couldn't of hoped for a better hotel to suit the weekend of xmas shopping, work and catching up with friends. Only major downside is the fee for Broadband (really this needs to be incorporated into room rates). There is a steep charge for parking as well ($35 per day) but that's Sydney for you and you have to wear it if you're going to drive.. The rooms are comfortable and have everything you need. Full well decked out kitchen (including mini bar) and laundry. A fantastic touch was full size washing/ detergent packs. No need to find a convenience store to upgrade from the usual sample packs you get in serviced hotel apartments that only last one wash. Reception were accommodating to my request to be moved to a higher floor after I saw the view from the room they initially gave me. I did not want to spend the weekend looking out onto a brick wall! That was in an executive room on lvl 8 (and I suspect) all the ones below. I was moved to level 12 with no fuss and the view of George st and neighbouring office blocks was just fine. No post card but more personality then a brick wall! I was more then happy with the executive studio - it was open planned with the bed pretty much in it's own space between the kitchen and the bathroom (which is a little small) - with a full size built in wardrobe. The bed was extremely comfortable! Past the kitchen was the lounge / dining area with sofa bed, arm chair and dining table for 4. There is also a small balcony. Non smoking rooms that really did seem like no one had ever smoked in them before which was great. Overall $169 (no parking, broadband included) for the studio is a great rate for what you get. In fact it's pretty hard to beat in Sydney. The hotel feels new and is exceptionally clean and well designed. The pool on the roof level is great if the weather is good - small view of the harbour. I had a major hassle when checking out - getting charge twice for my room! On arrival back home 10 days later I noticed the $500 'security deposit' they had taken had also not been returned to my card. A number of phone calls later the situation was sorted out - but having all that money taken out over the xmas period didn't make me too happy. Hotels should only take an imprint of credit cards and not freeze funds. No matter what they say they are never returned with in 'a few days time'.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cdisgusting, absolutely putrid\u201d", "Author": "aroma83", "ReviewID": "UR13027224", "Content": "let me just start by saying that the saville hotel in sydney was the most disgusting hotel i have ever stayed in! the rooms smelt like damp carpet and the level of service was utterly ridiculous. the staff seemed more on the ball than management. clueless some were! meant to be a 4 star hotel, i wouldn't even grant this hotel half a star. i'd rather stay in a backpackers hostel and pay double, (not to mention the fact that the saville hotel is severely over priced) if you are planning a trip to this hotel i sincerly urge you to rethink your decision, trust me you will regret it, just like i and the others i stayed with do.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rye, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent accommodation, service, LOCATION\u201d", "Author": "Viscount812", "ReviewID": "UR12852585", "Content": "This hotel was booked on our behalf by Trailfinders. Withe my 17 year old son accompanying my wife and self, a two bedroomed apartment was the ideal way to avoid the dreaded single room supplements. And this hotel was an ideal choice. Spacious comfortable rooms, complete with flat screen TVs in the lounge and master bedroom, and a complete kitchenette with a washing machine and tumble dryer included in the room and in the charges. Clean warm and comfortable. The hotel has its' own small restaurant, but being located right in the centre of the business district, there were many places to eat out locally at bargain prices. Just down the road was Jacksons at George - and their superb cooked breakfasts at about $10 each and unlimited coffee and orange juice for another $2.50. Watch out for local eateries offering $10 steaks in the evening - we were never disappointed by one of these! The hotel is perfectly located - a couple of minutes walk from Wynards station, 5 minutes to Circular Quay, 10 minutes to the Queen Victoria Building Mall (QVB). In short, you didn't waste time or money getting anywhere in central Sydney - you were there. The icing on the cake with this hotel was the level of service that was provided in a friendly manner all of the time. Particularly when we first arrived at 6.45 in the morning bleary eyed having flown in direct from London with just a couple of hours break in Singapore. We asked if we could leave our bags with reception until our room was available for check-in. Bless them - they moved things around and found an excellent room that we could go straight into and stay. That enabled us to crash out for a few hours and recover from our journey. They'll never know how much that gesture was appreciated, but it truly was and they didn't charge us a penny for it. That was the kind of hospitality we experienced for the rest of our stay as well. I cannot recommend too highly.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton", "Title": "\u201cGood Location - Get the right floor.\u201d", "Author": "SimonSouthampton", "ReviewID": "UR12789818", "Content": "We arrived at 09:30 AM on New Years Eve somewhat tired after a poor flight from Singapore.

We went to the room which was located on the corner of George Street and an Alley way down the side. It was gloomy and smelled of smoke, and was noisey at 10:00 in the morning. We went back to reception and was tol that the manager had found a 2 bed appartment on the 9th floor if we were not hppy with the previous one. A much better room and location, however the rooms are showing signs of age and could do with a major makeover. The rooms were however clean, and cleaned on a daily basis. Interesting views over George Street, New Years eve was noisey with the windows open, however the Double Glazing worked very well. Location is brilliant for the whole of Sydney, we were able to pop back during the day to drop shopping, pick up water etc. The cooking and washing facilities are OK, more for doing a pizza than anything more elaborate, however they do have all the things you would need to cook a 3 course meal.
