The service at entrance, both reception and concierge were amazingly friendly and helpful. All hotels should have people like this! Thanks! We pre-booked also breakfast, and it was a good decision, seen the choice of fresh fruits, juice coffee & tea, cereals, chinese breakfast (noodles, dim sum, etc) and european breakfast (croissant, toast, jam, etc). Waiters were always attentive and gentle. It's a great choice for it's very attractive price.The only thing I would change is the pre-paid airport shuttle service which costs 140HKD each person, but in fact you pay less with combination of subway Olympics-Kowloon and then Airport Express from Kowloon to Hong Kong Int'l Airport....no wonder that we didn't use taxi or hotel shuttle service for the transfer back at the airport when we were leaving Hong Kong... All in all, in any case, I would suggest other people to stay at this nice and friendly hotel, suitable for all kind of types of guests (in fact, we could see all types of customers, from business people, to couples, to little & big families, from Western countries, but also a lot of Asian people).", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat service staff but Tiny rooms\u201d", "Author": "hicheerios", "ReviewID": "UR139619203", "Content": "I have decided to stay here for 4 nights after reading positive reviews online.

I was pretty taken aback by that. Hotel provided free shuttle service to various places like Mongkok MTR/Langham Place, Kowloon AEL and China Macau Ferry Terminal which was very convenient and fast. Shuttle bus service always leaves on schedule- so a tip is to be there at least 10-15 min before the scheduled timing as at times there will already be a long queue. I felt that the nearest Olympic MTR was a little far from the hotel (especially after a long day of shopping), at least a 10 min walk and a hassle if it rains or missed the shuttle bus.

Service is very consistent despite the more hectic work days when there is typhoon. Both of them really lead by example. Lady Manager and egg station chef needs serious improvement. In fact, they should be sacked! The latter can\u2019t even prepare a proper egg omelette. The lady manager drags her feet when she walked with no smile on the face or anything. No sense of integrity when we feedback to her about and unidentified particles in the glass of orange juice and refuted our claim by saying there\u2019s nothing inside the OJ after she inspected it. Room: Quad room on 20th floor. Double kings bed was very comfortable. Single twin beds were a little shaky. Location: Near to Olympic MTR station. Free shuttle bus to Mongkok MTR station but we didn\u2019t try it as we were commuting mainly via Taxi. Other service: Free WI-FI.

The staff there were super good and provided us with excellent service. The bell boys were amazing and they always opened the door for you...every single time. However, the staff in the restaurant were not quite good. They had no smile and therefore customers don't feel welcome. The breakfast was not good...the menu was always the same...the chef at the cooking station was always invisible...because he's not at the station most of the time. I think they need more staff there in the morning so the chef can focus in cooking at the station. The housekeeping in this hotel is wonderful. The lady paid attention to every detail so she would arrange everything in the way that we want after one or two days. Better yet, we stayed there in two separate periods with four days in between because we travelled to Macau. When we came back from Macau, she even prepared the slippers that suited our needs, two pairs with adult size and two pairs with child size...very thoughtful. The location is not a good one but I must say it's quite convenient. The Olympic subway station is just 5 minutes away and once you cross the street and go into HSBC centre, you can actually walk through buildings to get to the subway station without going outside. The lobby is small and crowded with people using wi-fi. The elevators were slow...the shuttle bus was only once an hour and not enough space for peak hours...so be prepared to losing your ride even though you were there on time. The New Kowloon Indoor Plaza is closeby and there's a dry cleaner in there. So if you need laundry service, it's much cheaper. There's a restaurant on the second level called \"Tai Hing\" with excellent food...BBQ pork, roasted pig and much more...yum!

In this one, I booked a comfort room. No problem of noise as mentioned in other reviews, probably because the floor of my room was high. I often travel and must say the Cosmo staff is the best I've never seen. Cammo84 is right: all employees look always so happy to help. I've no idea where they find their energy, they look like always hoping you will ask them sth and they are constantly focusing on your well-being, from the beginning till the end of your stay. Approach the hotel, 5 employees will open the doors for you, they propose you to store your suitcases the last day before you ask for it, the cleaning ladies arrange the room with cute personal attentions after knowing your habits, etc. etc. non stop surprising great attitude. This high quality staff can unfortunately not cover the average level of the hotel itself. The room was clean but too small (even if you can see that the architects have been working well to optimize the space). The bathroom was nice but you are a bit tight on toilet and the door system makes you feel a lack of privacy. I agree with JENNIFERLELACHEUR about the problem of the lift: one lift for all the hotel cause unwanted waits. There is a free shuttle bus service, but it is totally unefficient (1 per hour!), it's better to go by walk to Mongkok MTR Station (15 minutes, easy way) (I don't recommend the Olympic MTR Station because only the expensive lines pass there). HK travellers tell you that it's common in HK to have small rooms. It's true but it doesn't mean that you have to choose a \"common HK Hotel\". I recommend the Harbour Plaza 8 Degree (review coming soon): spacious rooms with same budget, the location isn't perfect but its free shuttle service is very efficient (1 per approx. 20 min.).

Short walk to the Olympic Mall which has Western food including a Starbucks. - Shuttle takes you to the area close to the Ladies Market - Staff is polite and efficient Cons - As mentioned in other reviews the sound proofing could use some improvement. I stayed there shortly after the start of Chinese New Year and it was quite noisy for most of the evening (expected) but the door did little to buffer the sound. - It is slightly confusing for drivers to find the entrance which isn't the hotels fault but should be noted - Views from the rooms are not much. My last room looked straight into the building next door - It is in the Mongkok area which is a good trek away from the Kowloon area and the Night market, Elements, Shopping, and the ferries to Hong Kong Island - Be sure you book with this hotel and not their sister on Hong Kong Island. I have done this and had to take a taxi to the other hotel, which by the way is quite nice Overall this is a good deal for a couple of nights. I usually book one night before my flight to the US after business in Mainland China. its a good detox before the long trip and I can prepare and relax, have a good meal, and maybe do a little walking around town.

A few mins walk to Olympic MTR Station which also has a great food hall and shopping mall aswell as close to Ladies Market etc. The rooms were pleasant enough. Size is whats expected of Hong Kong. Bad points...upon arrival the receptionists were rude and abrupt and demanded a HKD$1000 deposit to be kept until departure. This seems totally unreasonable and i do not recall anything being made clear about this upon time of booking. When the paperwork was sorted, nothing was offered, ie excursions, details of the area, maps, details of transfers, where our room was etc etc. Not a good first impression at all. Breakfast was awful and expensive. There was a small selection of fruit, congee, dumplings (sweet and savoury), sausages, boiled eggs, rice parcels, beans and a chef who made omelettes/fried eggs, none of which were labelled btw. Hardly a varied menu when the price is so high. The saving grace was the toast maker! I filled up on toast to start the day then decided to go elsewhere for breakfast on the remaining days. Rooms were small but clean which is fine. However, they are not sound proofed very well at all. Every noise in the corridor can be heard and the staff didnt seem to understand discretion and could be heard bellowing at all hours (mainly via a walkie talkie which sounded like it was set on the highest volume). The aircon was great but noisy so it was a choice of sleeping and being hot or having the aircon on and not sleeping......... Lifts were SLOW! If you need to get to the lobby for a transfer, I would suggest leaving your room at least ten mins before time. We were stuck in one lift for a while as it went to every floor except ours!

Several times I asked them to write addresses in Chinese for me to show taxi drivers and they were always happy to help out. The wifi in the lobby was fairly quick. The location isn't exactly central, but they do run a regular shuttle bus which goes to the southern end of Kowloon, so it's not terribly inconvenient.

For the price, ti's really worth it. The quality is 5 star, only the size is a bit too small. The space is just enough (literally), you have space for 2-3 luggages, and enough space for one person to move around the room at a time. Comments; 1. Shuttle : We availed of the free shuttle from the airport upon arrival. It was very punctual all the time (atleast during those times we used it). 2. Room : Upon arrival we were upgraded for free to a superior room. The room was nicely decorated, and well thought of to maximize all the space available. The air conditioning was perfect and the room is squeaky clean. 3. Comfort room : I love the rain shower. the water pressure is really really strong, it's so comfortable. The space is small though just enough for an average person to bathe, with just enough space to put your toiletries. The comfortroom walls were translucent so it's best to be roomies with people you're comfortable with. 4. Beds - it's clean and comfortable, just enough for one person though (single beds), we tried sharing (because we were 3 adults in a room supposedly for 2), so it was a bit comfortable because the beds were smaller than the standard single bed. 5. Breakfast buffet - it's cheap if you choose the one bundled with the room, but i don't think it's enjoyable to eat it daily for more than 2 days because the selections don't change that much. plus there are a lot of bakeries and restaurants around the hotel that you can try. From what i can remember the selections are 2 kinds of fruit, salad, ham, potato wedges, 4 kinds of dimsum, rice, noodles, sausage, egg/omelet, juices, breads, give or take 3 more dishes that vary per day, i couldn't remember the others. 6. location - it's about 10-15 minutes leisure walking from the olympic station mtr. it's not so difficult to get there because more than half of the walk is a covered bridge. Near the mtr olympic station there's the olympic mall, a 3 building mall like glorietta (if you are familiar with the philippines malls). 7, service - the staff is very approachable and responsive about inquiries and requests. they are very polite as opposed to most staff (of restaurants and stores) that we met there throughout our stay. overall, it's really worth it for the price. especially for those people who just plan to shop around hongkong and have a comfortable sleep at night.

Another example of brilliant service. The rooms were good - the bed is slightly firmer than I personally like, but I've found that at many hotels around the globe.

For the price, I thought it was a pretty good deal. Promo was through the hotel website. They respond promptly to emails which was good. I had a number of requests for the room (on one of the higher floors, facing the McDonald's side, away from the elevators). Got the first 2, but was placed in a room in front of the elevators. We arrived in the morning, but were allowed early check-in (check-in is at 2pm). I'm thinking that's the reason why we got the room in front of the elevator, maybe it was what's readily available when we arrived. Since we were going to spend most of our time outside, figured that it was not a problem. Check-in was quick. There was a bit maintenance work going at the time of our stay, there was a notice of apology in the room about work going until 5 or 6 pm. Again not really a big problem, but there were a bit of banging noises i guess with the repairs. Room was small, bathroom was small, but was just fine, again with the price. Wifi in the room had additional charges so was careful not to use it - there's free wifi in the lobby, so most guests would hang out there. The hotel can add more sofas for sitting there, as it can get crowded. Location was okay, with a number of eateries and restaurants around the neighborhood. Good thing about the hotel shuttle, though try to be early before departure times as it can get filled quick. The Olympic station MTR is a bit of a walk, but not that far. Overall, the hotel was a good base during our stay. It may be a bit out of the way, but it also gives you a local neighborhood feel. The staff were helpful.

Booked it through hotel website 30 days in advance so we got a really good rate compared to other hotels in hongkong these days. We booked superior room which also included breakfast in the room rate. Going to the hotel from Kowloon airport express station, you can take hotel free shuttle bus which runs every hour. However, we took taxi cos our arrival time wasn't match with the bus schedule. The taxi costs about 50 HKD, 10 for the luggages I think. Anyway, you can take the bus but make sure you arrive about 10 minutes at the right spot before the schedule time cos the bus will stop only few seconds there. The hotel itself is nice and clean. The lobby is full of bellboys who's willing to help you with your luggages and always open the door for you. Check in process is fast. I already let them know through mail before that we needed late check out as our flight was in the late evening and they responded back quickly that they allow us to check out as late as 4 p.m. This is really a big plus for us. Our superior room is small as expected and looked exactly like the pictures in their website. The bathroom is small but very functional. I really like its rain shower. Not recommended for two people who are not couples though (unless you are really close to each other), as the bathroom is not private at all. The bathroom door cannot be closed tightly and there's a hole between the door and the wall that allow person in bedroom to see person in bathroom. But we have no problem with that and I found it's nice to hear tv while taking bath. :) Breakfast is nice. There's variety of food to choose, congee, dimsum, eggs, bacons, sausages, noodles, breads, salad, cereal and juices. For this price, what can you expect more! The complimentary shuttle bus is quite handy. But beware of the crowd in the morning and late evening. Be sure to arrive at the bus before its departure time about 15 minutes. We once waited for the bus at china hongkong city stop at 10.45 p.m. which is the last round to find out that it was already full from the langham stop.

A GPS unit is helpful as it is easy to get lost in the area while walking. I didn't take the shuttle service; it didn't run frequently so it was not a good use of my limited time.

The location is pretty good, with 2 MTR stations within easy reach: Mongkok and Olympic. Depending on where you need to go, these stations will both get you there nicely. The free hotel shuttlebus is another handy way to get around - stopping at Mongkok station and finishing at Kowloon station. It goes every hour, but watch out as the morning ones can be pretty full. The only thing that took marks down for me was the lack of free wifi in the rooms, which should be done these days, especially somewhere like HK. The result of this is that people are constantly in the lobby on the free wifi there, and there are rarely seats for you to check your own email.

(please see the pictures) when i called them ask about the shower room floor, they're answer is it's the style......

From the airport, i took the airport express (i was using Octopus Card, just board it when it arrives, payment of fare is only made when arrived at destination) to Tsing Yi, where i followed the signage and took the MTR to Olympic, everything is in the same building. Upon reaching Olympic, look for the board that shows directions to various places, look for Cosmo Mongkok, this should lead you to a covered walkway which branches out to a T junction, with a tall building in front of you, staircase to bus terminal on your left and walkway to a building on your right. Walk down the ramp beside the staircase on your left and walk along the covered walkway. Walk straight till the end of the walkway, it should be a 5-10min walk, you will find yourself facing a staircase down to the road level in front of you, on your right should be an overhead bridge. Cross the overhead bridge and take the lift/staircase to the road level. Walk right ahead after coming out of the lift/ from stairs and turn right into the first street. Walk straight till you see McDonalds and right across the road from McDonalds is Cosmo Mongkok. The whole walk takes around 15min. The hotel mentioned that the walk should be just around 5-7min, it is actually true as there is a shortcut, which is to cut across the tall building near Olympics. But this is only viable during the business hour of the building. Service provided by the front desk counter and the bellboys was exemplary. The bellboy literally glided across the lobby just to make sure that he got hold of my luggage! There was a queue at the counters when i arrived for check-in, but the manager-in-charge attended to me by asking for my passport and confirmation letter while i was still in the queue, hence, when it was my turn, the key was ready and all they need was my signature. No time wasted! However, i was rather disappointed when i entered the room (Room Comfort) as it was really small, but given that it is Hong Kong, it was also somewhat expected. The sound proofing in the room was not good, as i was awakened by children running along the corridor and the noise generated. This, however, did not pose as a big issue to me. There is a shuttle bus service provided by the hotel, but it is always full. I used the map printed at the back of the card slot and made my way to Mongkok by foot. It was a 15-20min walk, but i enjoyed it as i got to pass by the markets, streets and the shops that the locals frequent. I even bought pork ribs from the market area for breakfast, it was delicious and cheap! For travellers travelling with family members or friends, the bathroom may not provide enough privacy as there will be a 5cm gap between the sliding door and the partially frosted glass wall of the bathroom even if the door is completely closed. To make things worse, the room is lined with mirrors, which allows one to see around blind corners. On the other hand, the glass wall of the bathroom, which is not frosted at the top and bottom, should not pose as a problem while one is showering as the steam from the shower will cloud out the non-frosted parts. I did not experience any long wait for the lift. I made use of the third lift on the lift as well, which speed up the waiting.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cCute & stylish\u201d", "Author": "Layla M", "ReviewID": "UR131090016", "Content": "I recently stayed there on the 26th of May for 2 nights, we landed in Hong Kong around 9am and got to the hotel in about 30mins.

The location is ok; close to Olympic station and even though there was some renovation going on, the lobby was still clean and tidy. Couldn't say the same for the room as the bathroom wasn't what I would consider sanitary or properly cleaned as there was some rusty watermarks on the bottom part of the toilet. Being a frequent business traveler to HK and China, I bring my own outlet adapters just in case there isn't a compatible outlet in the room or I don't want to go through the hassle of borrowing one from the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised that they had one included in the room and understood perfectly that they had a noticed taped to the adapter saying that if you took it, you would have to pay HKD$20 (or something) for it. I used it and left it on the outlet knowing that the hotel staff would check for it and it would be easier for them to see the item right there. The bed was comfortable and the AC wasn't too loud that one couldn't fall asleep. But around midnight there was this smell of Durian fruit coming from the AC and boy it was annoying. I didn't bother calling the front desk though because I was very sleepy and once I fell asleep, I didn't notice the pungent scent as much. On the small desk they had two bottles of water, complimentary, but I didn't drink them as I brought my own. And then there was the culprit which leads to the review title. It was a small can of Pringles chips. I didn't even bother to touch it as 1) I bring my own snacks, some soda crackers on all my trips, and 2) I know that these items always cost a fortune and of course, there was a small yellow post-it that said HKD$20. The next morning, I ate some crackers and got ready to check out; I planned to have breakfast at the McD's across the street. During checkout, the receptionist (polite young lady) asked me to wait while they checked the room. No problem, but then I overhead the conversation coming from the walkie-talkie (I'm a native speaker of Mandarin and understand some Cantonese). The staff that checked the room said I opened the can of chips and ate just a little, not all of it, just a little. The receptionist said that I ate the chips and wanted me to pay. I was very unhappy. I didn't eat it, didn't even touch it and told them so. But they said I did and wanted me to pay. I asked the receptionist to call the staff down or either I could go upstairs and rebuff their accusation. I further explained, that if I were to eat that can of chips, given the exorbitant price, I would darn well finish it and take the can as a souvenir. In the end, after much arguing, the receptionist said it was ok. As I was quite pissed then, I told her that it is very unwise to lose a customer over a can of chips, and that it precisely what they have done. Next time I'm traveling to HK, I will be sure to avoid Cosmo Mong Kok, and their sister hotels Comso Hotel HK and Cosmopolitan Hotel HK. I will also advise any travelers that if you're staying at these hotels, when you're checking into your room, have a hotel staff go through all the stuff in the room with you using a checklist and note that items such as towels, hangers, whatever drinks are in the fridge, snacks and bottled waters that are out in the open are there/unused! Because you never know! If there is something missing in the room that you don't know of, like an electrical outlet adapter that was supposed to be there but wasn't, or an empty soda can in the fridge that you didn't even bother opening, and if it's your bad luck that the person who stayed in the room before you twisted open a non-complimentary bottle of water but didn't drink any of it, when you check out, they'll accuse you of eating/drinking/taking those and charge you for it!", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Margaret River, Western Australia, Australia", "Title": "\u201cRecomended\u201d", "Author": "Corey C", "ReviewID": "UR130169971", "Content": "Staying at the cosmo hotel was more than amazing the service was excellent and all staff more than willing to help out in some kind of way..there is a gym that provied everything needed, all rooms provide air-con at 10 degrees witch you deffently need and want the beds are suprizingly comfy, super amazing shower with megga size head never running out of hot water.

No closet and no shelf for suitcases. Small stand-up shower that got the sink area wet when you used it.

I think this is the most worth it hotel I have ever stayed in Hong Kong. We got the early bird rate and got our rooms at a cheaper rate. A few days before our scheduled check in, I already received an e-mail from them giving us a weather update and asking for confirmation of our check in time. I got several concerns and they responded swiftly and granted my request for a double bed. When we got to the hotel at around 8 a.m. , we were fortunate that we were allowed to check in early as there was already a room available. I loved the scent of the hotel in the lobby. When we got to the room, we were amazed by the glass wall with view. The curtains were electronic and provided a good shade if you want your room to be dark. The bed and pillows were comfortable and clean. The bathroom was small but very strategically located that moving around does not seem to be a problem. The water pressure and heater were also working great! The airconditioner and tv in the room were also working well! But I must say the aisle and area for elevators are so cold. The best feature of the hotel for me is its free shuttle service to and from the Kowloon Station (very convenient transpo to and from the airport), Tsim Sha Tsui area (China Ferry Terminal) and Mong Kok Station (Drop off at Langham Place). Of course you have to be on time, or better be there ten minutes before the scheduled time of the shuttle to make sure you don\u2019t miss it. The shuttle arrives on the drop off points on the dot or earlier. The staff and service should be well commended because they make sure their guests feel special and taken care of.

Cosmo Hotel Mongkok is located in Tai Kok Tsui in Kowloon, Hong Kong. You can take a short cab ride from the Kowloon Airport Express Station to the hotel. The approx. cab cost from the station to the hotel is only 5 USD or $40 HKD. Be advised the hotel also offers a free shuttle back to the Kowloon Airport Express Station (this is something good to know). If you need to catch the MTR (subway), you have to walk approximately 10 mins to Mongkok or take a 3 USD cab ride to Mongkok. It can get a bit annoying for some people but I had no problem with it. Upon arrival you will encounter a group of English speaking young staff at check-in. I booked my room directly from the hotel's website and they currently offer a very reasonable 30% discount if you book 30 days in advance. On my first night, I got a free upgrade to one of their suites. The suite is basically double the size of a regular room. After one night, I moved to one of their regular rooms which is ok for one person but I think it could be a little tight for a couple to share. The bed in the suite is much more comfortable than the regular room for sure. After staying in the regular room for one night, I inquired about upgrading my regular room to the suite. The cost according to the check-in staff was $600 HKD a night or approx. $80 a night (the upgrade does include FREE in-room WIFI and free breakfast). I was on vacation so why not? It is worth mentioning that I was only given 1 breakfast ticket per day when their hotel website said the each upgrade includes 2 breakfast tickets. When I inquired about it, I was told my room upgrade is only eligible for 1 breakfast ticket which I thought was odd. Oh well. As mentioned by the other reviewers, there's FREE WIFI in the lobby but it does get crowded at times. The small gym in the hotel is ok...I used it twice. There is no swimming pool in the hotel but there is a prepared food center/market/community center located directly across the street from the hotel and if you have an Octopus card, you can use the in-door community pool for only $2.50 USD. I used the pool one afternoon it was raining outside and it was actually pretty good. Would I stay at the Cosmo Hotel Mongkok again? The answer is YES. If you are looking for a clean, safe, and viable 3 stars hotel located near Mongkok then the Cosmo Hotel Mongkok is definitely worth it.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cPros and Cons to consider\u201d", "Author": "cali118", "ReviewID": "UR129428568", "Content": "I stayed at Cosmo Mongkok 22-24 April 2012.

What you see is what you get, we were on the 14th floor and had a great view, rooms were very modern, clean, nice bathroom, beds were extremely comfortable just want you need after walking around all day :-) The rooms were quite small but overall we were both very happy. I'll be honest we didn't have a lot to do with the staff however when we needed there help about taxis, shuttle bus, checking in they were very helpful. The hotel provides a free shuttle bus which we thought was brilliant, it takes you to various places and cuts out a lot of walking :-) It leaves every half an hour on the dot so make sure you don't miss it :-) . The hotel is in a great location, as you know Hong Kong is such a busy place and even when you walk outside the hotel at 8am in the morning you just get this buzz. Opposite the hotel is a McDonalds and the most fantastic Bakery which you have to try. Everything is within walking distance, 10-15 minutes your in Mongkok shopping area, Ladies Market which you have to go to but make sure you haggle a good price, my boyfriend got so good at it that half the time we got our goods for quarter of the price. The MTR station is about a 10 min walk, the MTR is very easy to use, so convenient, it really does take you from A-B within minutes, very clean. If your in HK for a few days make sure you get an Octopuss card its a lot cheaper and hell of a lot easier, when you have used your last train for your trip take your card back to the help desk and they will give you some money back (cant remember exactly how much). Overall HK is one of the best places I have ever been too, I would jump back on a plane today if I could and I would definitely stay in this hotel again. One thing we loved about this hotel is that its not in the tourist area of Hong Kong which is great because you get to see HK for what it really is, the locals, their way of living, their culture, the food but you do have the option to hop on to the MTR and visit all the touristic areas and you would be there within 15 minutes.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pune, India", "Title": "\u201cGreat family room\u201d", "Author": "Rajiv_pune27", "ReviewID": "UR128678569", "Content": "In HK it's difficult to find good hotels that accommodate a family of 4.

Booked almost 2 months in advance and it was cheaper than any other source I checked and I work at a travel agency. Misleading info regarding distance from MTR. A leisurely walk to/from Olympic station takes about 15 mins and not 4 mins as hotel website states. I deliberately timed it and tried VERY brisk walking and it still took us 8 mins. I assume one should be running or at least jogging fast to be able to achieve 4 mins and that\u2019s if you don\u2019t end up getting run over by a car while crossing the streets trying to beat 4 mins. Hotel does provide free shuttle every hour to/from malls with mtr stations as well as the Kowloon station for the airport express. Location is very convenient in the sense that there is a mcdonalds, wellcome, watsons, mannings right across the street as well as a lot of small eateries with varying cuisines all within a few minutes walk from the hotel. Rooms are small but expected for new hotels in HK. You can literally take a shower, brush your teeth and use the toilet at the same time while in the bathroom although I didn't try it myself. Rooms are cleaned every day though it was quite strange when someone knocked on our door one morning to ask if we had any laundry. I like the contemporary design of the rooms. Very bright and with lots of mirrors to make it look bigger than it actually is. There was nowhere to place our luggage though. We had to lay them out on the floor the whole time we stayed there. Walls and door are pretty thin. I could hear people walking past our door all day long. I actually woke up one night because I thought someone was in our room but turned out it was just someone with heavy feet walking past our room. If the room next door is noisy you can also hear them through the wall. Elevators are a rather long wait during peak hours. They have a third lift that they renovated from being a freight elevator but they don't tell you about it unless you ask or already know about it because it's hidden behind a door to the side being previously a service lift. Hotel employees were all very friendly and helpful and spoke and understood english fairly well. The pillows were pretty shallow so I asked for extra pillows and they provided them very quickly. One incident I found rather disappointing was when I called up the operator asking for the reservations hotline for Cathay Pacific and the only answer I got was that she couldn't help me. I would think it was a simple enough task to check online for it but I couldn't do it myself because I didn't have a laptop for this trip.

Overall, the 5 nights iwe stayed there we awful, 1 good sleep in 5 days, only because i turned the air con on full, therefore it drowned out the noise of the doors and people. The people who made the noise were either Phillopinos or Mainland Chinese as i followed them out of the lift one time. One room at 2am,were having a party, the noise was so loud. One thing the hotel could do is put some sort of strip on the door to stop it banging each time it is shut and put families with children on different floors to groups of friends who will obviously come in late and bang doors all night going to each others rooms.

The check in process was quick and easy. We were given a room on the 23rd floor. Elevators are slow. 2. Location was convienent. As ppl have indicated we are a 5-10 min walk to Olympic station. The subway is soo big which is why it may take up to 10 mins. For those that complain about the walk, don't be lazy. 3. Lots of restaurants - Mcdonalds across the street, a congee/rice noodle roll restaurant 3 mins away and more restaurants in the vicinity. A &-Eleven nearby. 4. Room - Not surprised it was a small room however most hotels had small rooms. We didn't stay in our hotel room all day which is why it didn't make a difference. Our room were made up every other day bc we opted not to have them made everyday. 5. Wi-Fi - Free only in the lobby unless you pay extra for your room. There are generally a handful of ppl in the lobby using wifi. 6. Checking Out - Quick and smooth. Check out time: 12pm. The manager insisted on loading our bags into our cab. A great service all around. We paid about 180 HKD to the airport. The airport express shuttle is also an alternative way by using the MTR. 7. Free Shuttle bus to Langham Place Hotel/Mall - We could walk to the Langham place in 10-15 mins. We preferred walking as the shuttle runs every hour or so. And it takes more than 15 mins to get home with the drop off/pick ups from other location. We didn't mind the exercise! Gave us a chance to shop at the Olympic centre with a wide variety of shops and restaurants. Overall we would come back to this hotel again. It was good value, no complaints and superb service.

In the street across from the hotel there are a couple of dessert places that make some great traditional and Chinese orientated slants. The rooms are not the biggest but were very comfortable even with 2 children sharing. Amenities were relatively new and sufficient to our requirements. The family suites were great and met our large party needs. The gym was just a treadmill, bike, stepper and some weights (could do with a good clean). We had the buffet breakfast included in our package and it varied a little each day but by day 5 we were over the lack of variety. Overall, we had good service, good location and good place to stay.

The free shuttle to Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui area only runs every hour by the half hour, such as 9:30am, 10:30am. We want to take the free shuttle to the Kowloon station to board the Airport Express. We were told to leave the luggage with them until the bus arrived. When it arrived, we were told to board the bus first. So we assumed they will load our luggage to the bus automatically. But when the bus started to move, we did not see anyone from the hotel loaded our luggage to the bus. We had to stop the bus driver, and went down the bus to the hotel to load the luggage ourselves. We could have left without our luggage and presumed they will deliver to the Kowloon station. They need to communicate better! When I asked for the deposit back, they said they had torn the credit card copy, but could not give me a copy of the torn credit card charge. I insisted that they made a photo copy and gave me the torn copy with \"cancel\" for my record, so that I can dispute any charge if they did charge me for the deposit. Worst of all, our room at #717, for 2 nights, 3/28 to 3/30/12, around 11pm to 2am, there was horrible, sewer type of smell in the bath room, either coming from the vent on the ceiling or the drainage near the toilet. The smell was so horrible that I felt dizzy and nauseated, and tried not to go to the bath room around this time.

Hong Kong hotels are expensive and rooms are small. I booked this hotel through expedia thinking this was the best deal available. I realized later on that the hotel website offered better rates with breakfast thrown in. Cosmo hotel is located in Mongkok and is about 7/8 minutes walk to Olympic MTR station and 12 minutes walk to Mongkok station. The area around is not very nice with lots of shops, small restaurants including some Thai restaurants close by. There is a McDonalds right opposite that is not upto normal standards. I had booked what is called a Superior room and I was told it is about 21 sq. meters in size. That seemed to be a decent size. What I did not know that the area included closet, a work desk and the washroom with only a shower area. A rain shower was a nice touch. There was no place or stool to keep the bags. Free internet is available in hotel lobby but if you use it in the room, it costs HK$132 per day and if you use two devices (a laptop and a smart phone for example), the cost will be double. Local calls are charged at HK$5 per call upto 30 minutes. Iron and ironing board are available on request. There is a restaurant that I did not use. Now what made my stay pleasant was their very helpful staff, concierge,bell desk and house keeping. All I needed was to ask and they would do their best to help. Their English was reasonably good. The hotel has a shuttle service to some important MTR stations like Mongkok, Kowloon and also to Hong Kong China ferry. The rooms are clean and comfortable despite their size. The lighting is good and they have night blind with electrical controls next to bed and an ergonomic desk. I had great help from Ashley Cheung in Reservations and Augustine Cheung, the Front Office Manager were a great help. Augustine asked me about my stay when I checked out and promised to do his best to iron out the wrinkles and said that a new and improved website will soon offer more rooms with better sizes.

Looking at its photos from its website, I got very excited to stay at this hotel. CRAMPED ROOM When I got my room (#618), I was quickly disillusioned and disappointed! The room is cramped (even smaller than the Japanese-style rooms that i have stayed at in Nikko Hotels in SFO), no room for luggage, the bed is right next to the glass toilet - there was not even a full chair to sit on after a long day out! You wouldn't even want to stay inside your room for long because you will feel claustrophobic! I asked to be transferred to another room but they claimed that it was fully booked! Thirty minutes after I grudgingly took out my stuff and toiletries, the front desk calls and says that there was another room at the 20th floor - but it was pretty much the same size and lay-out! Never, ever again will I stay here. BAD AREA The area that you will walk through to get to and from the MTR (both Olympia and MongKok Stations) are crowded and dusty - not safe especially at night. The views from the room is butt ugly so you need to pull down the shades and you end up staring at the few square meters around your bed! BRIGHT SPOT The only bright spot that this hotel can be proud of is their courteous staff - both the front desk and the concierge people. Housekeeping, perhaps because they do not speak English well, is another story. Good thing my father did not come with me on this particular trip. Even if I was alone in this room, I already felt very cramped - two people cannot definitely sleep comfortably in their rooms.

Every day, staff greeted you, opened doors and tried to help with bags. The rooms were cleaned and serviced daily. Staff offered helpful tips not only on restaurants in the area but also tourist destinations and how to get there with public transport. Who could ask for more? I travelled with family so we hired the Suite Air (2512) and were delighted. The rooms were small (but this is Hong Kong) and had been cleverly designed with mirrors and light wood to feel spacious. My parents had the bedroom, where it didn't feel quite like a western queen size bed, but was very comfortable. The bathroom had a tub, shower and a rain shower from the ceiling as well and was spacious. The only issue was a lack of easily accessible benchspace on which to store 3 people's toiletries. The door was indeed a sliding door with frosted glass which initially freaked me out, but although you could see people's legs to mid shin, nothing else was visible .... and with the tv on nothing else was audible either :) I spent the week sleeping on the sofa bed in the living area. Initially the bed was very firm and I woke with sore joints, but after mentioning this to one of the staff members, the mattress was apparently replaced - not sure exactly what was done, but the sleep quality did improve for the remainder of the trip. It was great having two 'spaces' to spend time in, as we could separate ourselves for a break as required. Free bottles of water (4 per day) was a great touch. The view of the city at night from the windows was fabulous and we couldn't hear any road noirse whatsover. Occasionally you could hear other people arriving to their rooms late at night, but this occurs in most hotels as people forget to keep their voices down in corridors. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was excellent. There was a western component as well as an asian component, so you were spoiled for choice. There tended to be the same range most days, with a few additional variations thrown in for good measure. From an asian perspective there was congee and a variety of dim sum and noodles with sticky rice on weekends. From the western perspective there was cereal, muselei, pastries, salad, cheese/meat, baked beans, sausages/bacon and an omelette/fried egg station. Got us going for the day beautifully. Location of the hotel was good. About 5 minutes walk from Olympic MTR station and perhaps 12 minutes to Nathan Road and the Mongkok MTR which opened up access to the rest of Hong Kong. The hotel also offered a free shuttle every hour to Langham Place (Nathan Rd), the Kowloon train station (airport train check in) and the China Ferry Terminal (ferry to Macau etc).

Moreover, the 24 hours check in is only subject to availabilyt. I was told that guest is requested to do the registration at least 3 days in advance and the check out time is subject to availability. So I would suggest everyone to recheck this with the reservation team when the booking is made. Luckily we could have late check out at 15:00 so it was only around 3 hours before we have to go to airport. Free shuttle service to Mongkok and nearby area is very useful but I would recommend guests to come to the bus long before the departure time since it is always full. Also the walking way from Mongkok or from Olympic station to hotel in the night is quiet. Although I think Hong Kong is a very safe place, I still suggest single traveller especially woman to take taxi back to hotel in the night. There is nothing much to talk about the Room, ABF or restaurant. Room is really small with size of approx. 20SQM, small closet and small shower room. Variety of ABF is good but it was the same selection for the whole week I stayed. There are many restaurants nearby for dinner and restaurant closes at around 22:00 daily Overall I still think this hotel is one of the good hotels and would consider coming back again if the offer is right.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South of France", "Title": "\u201cCould not fault the Cosmo!\u201d", "Author": "jlouise", "ReviewID": "UR125924836", "Content": "We paid for the standard, basic double bedded room, on the 17th floor, for 4 nights.

Check-in staff was okay, pleasant enough, but not all of them. Some of them seem only as good as your regular cashier at the check-out. At check-in I was promised a free, guaranteed late check-out, only to find someone calling me on the day of check-out asking why I hadn't vacated the room by noon... to their credit, the problem was quickly rectified and my late check-out was honoured! Good problem resolution! But shouldn't have happened in the first place - gives me the impression there is a communication problem within the hotel. Room was tiny. Clean, but tiny, and clearly losing the 'shine' I assume it once had when it was new. Bed was TINY. I am not a big person by any standard, and the bed was already a *tiny* bit too short for me. Beware if you are a big/tall person! Room had some problem with humidity. I found my papers and passport starting to warp after only two nights. There is a flat screen tv mounted on the wall, small, but with local and international channels, so it was appreciated. The location was average.

MTR was about 10 minutes away, I felt like exit C2 and C5 is nearer than the recommended exit B. Following exit C2 and C5 you will pass by local stores while exit C5 is by paedestrian walkway. Both different scenery and you could try them. Shuttle bus was on-time and efficient. One of the driver (wearing spec) helped us with our luggage when he picked us up from Kowloon Station.

I travel a lot, in Europe, USA and Asia. Generally, I am polite and accept a lot of things. This time though, I can not do anything else than warn you to do any booking at the Cosmo Hotel, Mongkok, Hongkong, located 88 Tai Kok Tsui road, Kowloon. Why would I say that? They have 5 different room categories, where the suites are the same in size and only differ in the usage (families, single). The room I booked is the 3rd biggest room, and when you see Superior, Executive and then on top of that \u201cCosmorganic\u201d, you say \u201cWOW\u201d at the first view of their website. When you see the rates and compare them with other hotels, you\u2019ll also say that the hotel must be impressive (since there are hotels with better rates available), as is their website. BUT: - if you are more clever than I was, you check not only the description provided at the pricing section, but go further down and click on the description of the rooms. IF you are clever then with imagination, you may figure out that 20sqm are NOT as big as one would think in the first place, since \u2013 that does INCLUDE the bathroom size. So, the room itself has 20sqm MINUS the bathroom, it\u2019s barely more that a bed plus a bit floor space. And yes, indeed I did NOT mention any place where you can store your luggage, or your clothes, since there hardly is any. - Your clothes have to stay in your luggage that you place on the small place at the window, where in the picture at their website the guy sits. That is the ONLY place besides the floor where you HAVE a place for it. Then there is a small hanger for 6 shirts, a safe, and a small box for your underwear. That\u2019s it. If you do travel with family (I heard that some people do that), you are screwed. A second luggage? Well, there is of course the desk, you can use that, right. Or the floor, but then you have to tip-toe around your luggage to get to the bed. - The bath \u2013 well, stylish, it is, no doubt. But \u2013 do you REALLY want a bathroom that consists of glass (although it\u2019s smoked), where the door does not really fit tidily, and where you share all the noises that usually occur when using a bathroom? I mean, I might not mind when travelling alone, but \u2013 again, some people do book a room with a kingsize bed not only to be used as a room for one person\u2026 - Ah \u2013 yes, the bed. Kingsize, I mentioned, right? I explicitly asked for it, and I got it confirmed while checking in. Well, I am an average European guy, 1.80m and about 85kg, wearing size L. I made a picture of that bed \u2013 check that out. I put my shirt on it for reference \u2013 the arms are hanging OFF the side of the KINGSIZE bed! Have you ever, EVER, seen a kingsize bed like this? Well, I for sure have not, except here\u2026When I lay my 1.80m flat on that bed, my feet are OFF the bed while my head touches the headboard. I am sure even Asians do have a different understanding of kingsize\u2026 - And \u2013 the cleanliness of the room. Ok, I admit, Asians are small by default, no offense intended (I like Asians and work with them a lot). But \u2013 the \u2026hmm, you can not call it a locker, or closet, it\u2019s more a wardrobe space thing with no door. Anyway \u2013 the top of that piece CAN be cleaned, so usually there is no need to keep the dust there, like they do. In lack of space, I tried to place there the cozy cover of the KINGSIZE bed, and was not able to avoid my sneezing \u2013 almost a kilo of dust came down then (at least it felt like that) \u2013 please check the picture, just for fun (taken AFTER the dust already came down, so that is what\u2019s still left there). Well, nothing really to worry about \u2013 I mean, the floor itself was not too clean either. Creamy white in general, it had several dark spots on it, that usually would have been removed at any other hotel I was so far. Not here though. The ultimate fun comes when you try to get a good rate and do not read and understand their terms and conditions. In every other hotel I was before, it was of course also the policy to provide better rates the earlier you book. But here, their rate do mean that, if you book the early bird rate with 30% discount, they REALLY mean that this has to be paid upfront (30 days actually), AND is NOT refundable, even when you booked for 30 days and need to check out after 3 days due to unexpected business needs. The whole money is then meant to be lost. Although I had some of such bookings made in the past at other hotels, I was every time able to rearrange things when there was a need, and pay only for the time I stayed. Mostly even with the agreed rate, some times with the higher daily rate that you would get when booking the same day. Then \u2013 additional services can be e.g. WiFi access. Most hotels I know provide WiFi access free of charge. Cosmo on the other hand does not. They charge depending on your booking. It might be the full charge of 132 HKD, or just the service charge of the internet company. Just in the lobby they have a free WiFi access. So \u2013 well, after all, I may mention that the hotel has some good sides too, as unexpected as it is. They have a free shuttle going every hour from the hotel to different places (MTR station,City centre). The staff is friendly too. The breakfast buffet is fairly good if you stay not too long, and the lobby is clean. Do NOT check though the restrooms that are close to the restaurant \u2013 you may have some hard times keeping your breakfast to yourself, since the time I checked them (3 times during my stay), they were as dirty as on a train station (ok, there are good train stations, but I guess you know what I\u2019m talking about, right?). Even the airport ones are in better shape than the ones here. It might be a temporary problem, but given my experience with the dust I somehow doubt that\u2026 Soo \u2013 if you STILL book this hotel, you can not say you have not been warned, and I wish you a pleasant stay nonetheless\u2026", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cVery good for a Hong Kong stopover\u201d", "Author": "Riever", "ReviewID": "UR124341712", "Content": "We spent 3 nights here on a stopover and found it very comfortable.

The other 2 nights we moved to level 21, still you could hear the sound though not as bad. For some reason there were vibration noises coming from the wall behind the bed so that also ruined my sleep in the morning. The hotel is on the fringe of Mongkok, so to get to Mongkok MTR you have to walk for about 10-15min through narrow streets. Let's just say the route isn't very scenic. There is a shuttle bus you can take every hour which drops you off at Langham Monkok but if you miss it then it's a long wait. If you do alot of shopping, then it's not one of those hotel where you can easily come back to drop off your bags take a breather before continuing.

The room itself was very nice and very spacious (for Hong Kong), the bed very comfortable. Some people might mind that the bathroom does not allow you full privacy (see photo). We would definitively stay there again provided that the price per night during the requested time is reasonable, as this time we paid for the 4 nights around 411 Eur which was a good deal for Hong Kong.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panay Island, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cCosmo Mongkok - a mid-price hotel with five star service\u201d", "Author": "archipelago", "ReviewID": "UR124092445", "Content": "The Cosmo Mongkok in many ways is a typical mid-price Hong Kong hotel but we were taken aback by the terrific service we received from hotel staff. It started even before we arrived. Sampling regional Chinese cooking was a focus of our trip. We used the excellent openrice.com restaurant review site and Michelin ratings to try to find Hong Kong restaurants which offered exceptionally good food while avoiding the over-elaborate, overpriced big hotel restaurants. Some of these Michelin rated restaurants are so popular that reservations need to be made days or weeks in advance. Further, we found that it was very difficult for English speakers to make reservations. Cantonese-only restaurant staff who answered our calls hung up when we called to make a reservation. We repeatedly pestered the Cosmo staff to make our reservations. They were fantastic, making all the reservations we requested and, when we were unable to get the reservations we wanted, they followed up to be sure that we got an alternative. When we checked into the hotel the staff worriedly recalled that we did not have a reservation for dinner on a particular night. Then, when I thought I had lost my passport, Cosmo staff sprang into action. They sent a staff member to accompany me to the restaurants at which we had dined, they got me information on the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong and filing a report with the Mongkok police station. Fortunately, my passport turned up in my traveling companions room but I learned a lesson about how dire the consequences are for losing a passport. One could be stuck in a foreign country for many days or even weeks trying to get get replacement travel documents through the sclerotic consular procedures. In short, I can't imagine that you could get better, more personalized service at the Peninsula for $500 a night than you get at the Cosmo Mongkok for $100. The Cosmo rooms are small as is typical for Hong Kong hotels, but they are very well designed to maximize the space. You'll pay about $90USD for a basic room at the Cosmo. We did quite a bit of research before we came to Hong Kong and visited several other economy hotels while we were in Hong Kong. Even booking a room at a guesthouse in Chungking Mansions or Sincerity will not save you that much money over staying at the Cosmo. The Cosmo is one of the best deals in Hong Kong. There is the matter of location. If you stay in Tsim Sha Tsui (TST), getting to top restaurants and tourist attractions is easier. You'll be able to stroll from your hotel to restaurants, museums and other attractions. That's a definite plus for TST hotels. The Cosmo tries to address this with a free shuttle bus. We ended up taking taxis or Hong Kong's fabulous subways. Hong Kong taxis are fairly cheap, about $40HKD from the Cosmo to TST. In reality, we found the Mongkok district itself appealing. It's a genuine working, bustling section of traditional Hong Kong, not a giant tourist trap. The area around the hotel, Ivy Street in particular, is a really nice neighborhood with some good restaurants. One of our favorite restaurants, One Dim Sum in Prince Edward, a long walk north of the hotel, must be one of the least expensive Michelin 1* restaurants anywhere. Three of us had a feast there for $135HKD, about 10% of what two of us paid for lunch at the upscale Sun Tung Luk -- and much more fun. Shopping for bargains in Mongkok is fun. It's not a long walk to the colorful Monk Kok shopping streets; sports shoe street, ladies market, and the computer and camera stores of Sai Yeung Choi Street. You'll find better bargains here than you will at the overpriced shops in TST. This is where the locals shop for bargains. I can't believe you'll not be satisfied with your stay at the Cosmo.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "australia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff\u201d", "Author": "tracy69", "ReviewID": "UR124044977", "Content": "Stayed at 3 different hotels during our trip and the concierge staff at this hotel were by far the most helpful and friendlist we came across - always there to open the door for us no matter what time of the day or night it was and very obliging.

Prior to our arrival, i emailed the hotel regarding my request to have a room above level 18 and away from the elevator. All of these requests were met and we even had a room with a lovely view. The room may not be exceptionally big, but it was really really cosy. In comparison to many other hotels in Mongkok, this was a real treat. Not forgetting that the interior design of the room is modern, comfortable and the brilliant use of mirrors gave the illusion of a larger room. The bed was really comfortable except for the fact that it was a little short. i could toss and turn during the night and wake up with my feet dangling off the bed. The pillows were a little too flat and soft but the hotel staffs were really accommodating in our requests for extra pillows. There may be no heating in the room however that wasn't much of an issue. (We are not talking about snowing countries here). The blanket was really really thick, soft and comfy. Kept us so snug and warm within. The bathroom was extremely clean and the shower head was strong and powerful. It was an enjoyment returning 'home' to stand under the powerful shower head blasting hot soothing water after a whole day of exploring in chilly temperature. Housekeeping staffs were friendly and service was good. The staffs in the hotel are pretty helpful and polite compared to majority of the hk population. A first time traveller might want to note that in hong kong, unless you can speak fluent cantonese, most people on the streets are rather impatient to help with directions. Many times, we were shouted at ,in cantonese, by shop owners. Therefore, the hotel staffs service standards are really commendable. Olympic Station is actually not a very short walk away from the hotel. I would recommend everyone to walk to mongkok because its just a mere 10 minutes walk away and 3 minutes drive away. If you dislike walking, you can take a taxi to mongkok station at a small price of 18 to 20(peak/off-peak hour) hong kong dollars. which is very very cheap! The hotel is surround by housing estates, 24 hrs convenience shops (7-11), small eateries(open till 3am) and supermarkets. I really really love staying in this district. It is a refreshing change from staying in hustling and bustling districts such as mongkok and TST. The human traffic is crazy. This hotel is extremely value for money as it is difficult to find hotel with such standards at such price.

Room had ceiling to floor windows with electronic controlled blinds which was pretty cool. Decor was modern, bed was firm and comfy. Bathroom only had shower which was okay for me as I don't use bathtubs. The one thing i didn't like is the shower pressure, it was very soft.... too soft for a nice hot shower at the end of a long walking day. And the shower lock that holds the shower handle I think was broken so we couldn't adjust the height, it just kept sliding down. Hairdryer pressure was soft as well so if this bothers you, bring your own. The staff are young and helpful and attire is well presented. Room had free bottled water. No wifi in the room and even if you brought a sim card (which is dirt cheap), you can't access it within the room - lobby and restaurant had free wifi. I purchased a HKD48 sim card (paid HK38 - had a HKD10 voucher when i brought the HK airport express travel pass) - the card had HKD48 and had a HKD10 free top up plus 30 min free wifi session. I was in HK for 5 days and made many many local calls, had HKD20+ left when i left HK (and i didn't even end up using the top up card) My room came with complementary breakfast, the selection wasn't huge and flashy but the quality was surprisingly good. There was an omelete station but no chef to be found to make it on some days. Our clothes also smell like the kitchen after dining in the restaurant. We had a light breakfast so we could sample the HK food! A lot of chit chat between the waiters when they had nothing to do which could seem quite unprofessional however, they were quick to clear the tables (but not too quick with refills). The hotel has free hourly shuttle buses that takes you to Mongkok station, tsim tsa tsui, kowloon airport express station. These buses are usually packed full in the morning so be quick to go down as once the bus is full, they will not allow you onto the bus. I think it would be good if the hotel would provide the shuttle every half hour knowing that a lot of people miss out on the buses in the mornings. Nevertheless, Olympic station is about a 8 minute walk away (not 4 mins) and Mongkok is quite a bit of distance away. A taxi ride to Mong Kok is roughly HKD20 + HKD5 per luggage. Beware that around 3-4pm, taxi drivers may refuse to take you because of the short distance... I found out this is the time they change shifts. Olympic station also has a massive shopping mall with a cinema. There are several 24 hour convenience store around, two supermarkets and plenty of restaurants.

The hotel is a newer property so its not bad. Was sharing the room with my parents so had a suite on the 25th floor. The sofa-bed is pretty comfy and there is a flat screen tv in the living room and bedroom. There is a very small eating area but I guess it is a good size room in land scarce HK. TV selections is great and there is a great view of the surrounding area since we are so high up. Furnishing are modern and minimalistics. The bathing tub is built into the floor so your feet kind of step downward when you go in. The rainshower and showerhead are not bad although the bathroom glass door cannot seemed to close 100 percent. The staff are nice and they try to accomodate your questions THE AVERAGE Buffet breakfast was included. While selection is ok, it did not change much over the 3 days I was there. The shuttle service was nice. However, Olympic Station is a couple of blocks away but that does make it convenient to go to places like Disneyland and Tung Chong. Also, it is easy to get to Mongkok main area (langham place shopping centre and ladies market) on foot (abt 10 min walk) or cab (abt HK20, the meter never even jumped at all) THE BAD the lifts are always packed. Only 2 lifts and it is a hassle to get down or up. Internet connections is only free in the lobby and apparently, the hotel package did not include internet in the room and in a place like HK where there are quite a few places with wifi, this seemed rather harsh. And I got issues with the locations as I feel that being that far away from the MTR is just totally inconvenient, especially when you can't get the cab Conclusion: Not a bad hotel if it fits your budget. You have to love to stay in a 'local' area. And if you dont mind walking a fair distance to MTR or know how to take the mini buses... then this is a good fit.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cgood value for your money\u201d", "Author": "lim002", "ReviewID": "UR122063955", "Content": "Stay twice during recent asian trip. very satisfied with services.Bell boys very helpful.

The service is good and the rooms were pretty big for HK standards. I never had a chance to try out the restaurant food, but I heard you cannot sit in there if you don't order something. There are a lot of cheap eats outside the hotel, which is good when you need to grab something on the go, but the food was just ok. It definitely wasn't the amazing flavor that I heard about in HK. I love Cantonese style Chinese food too! There's a McDonald's across the street too for your morning coffee. It's really strong. The value of the price paid was very reasonable and there is a free shuttle that takes you to the Mongkok train station. My real complaints are... -The wifi was only free in the lobby and very expensive in the rooms. - The shuttle filled up very fast and often there wasn't enough room for us. They don't allow standing. -The location of the hotel is at least a 15-20 minute fast paced walk from any train station. This makes it hard if you are traveling with someone older. - The carpets were vacuumed and cleaned, but there were a lot of stains on the floor. Also there was a cockroach in one of our 4 rooms.

Here's my experience: Pros: ------ Location: It is not really near to MTR station. But hotel does provide shuttle bus hourly from hotel to Langham Place (near mongkok station) and few other places. Even if you miss the bus, you can always take a cab to & fro Mongkok station for HKD20, to & fro Tsim Sha Tsui for about HKD30-40 which is quite reasonable. Nothing much happening nearby but you won't have problem looking for food or 7-11 nearby, and McDonald 24-hours is just right opposite. Room: Although the room size is not that big, but it was clean and modern. The room is bright enough during day time with the wide glass windows. The thing i like the most is the shower. Room service does not include changing new bed sheet and linen daily by default, it is upon request but it shouldn't be any problem. Service: Front desk service is ok. Concierge staff were more friendly and helpful. Value: Booked this hotel 1 month earlier via their official website with 30% off for early bird promotion which save me a lot. But this promotion is not entitle for any cancellation, full payment has to be made upon booking, so make sure your trip is confirmed before choosing this promotion. Cons: ------- Location: Overall is ok with shuttle bus and taxi. But it would be better if the frequency of shuttle bus can increase from hourly to half hourly. Value: Using wifi in room are required to pay HKD12 for service tax per day per device (your phone/tablet/laptop) upon check out, but using wifi in lobby is free of charge. Most of the time, lobby is pack. Service: I requested 2 rooms at same floor during booking and it was confirmed via email from customer service. However, when we check in, we were given 2 rooms in separate floor instead during first night. Reason given was no room available. Apart from that, room service done is not standard daily. Sometimes no water and floor mat after room service, and I have to request manually to get it. I would say it is not really consistent as it only happened to 1 of our room while the other was ok. * The only unpleasant experience was during check out, they actually charge us for 7 login on certain day, which is impossible as we only used 1 phone for browsing for that day. The staff insist that was our usage and suspect that we use wifi with other phone or laptop and want us to pay. After showing the proof of our iphone's mac address, and some argument went on, the staff finally waived the extra charges for us. That's the only thing we are not really satisfied about.

There is 24hrs McDonalds and a few shops and restaurants across the street as well. Rooms: I have booked a twin room with a colleague on a business trip. I think it is the smallest room I have ever stayed in. I guess the pictures speak for themselves. Two single beds with a small gap between and in front, so it enables you to walk around, but that's it. Dont bring more than 2 pieces of luggage or anything else, as there is definitely no space for this. The wardrobe is according to the size of the room, so for a weekend stay is fine, but anything longer will be big challenge. The bathroom is small too, while taking the shower you need to be careful not to open the curtain as with every move it might be the case. The bathroom is divided from the room by glass (this seems to be current trend in HK). Not much privacy if you are sharing with a colleague and in addition, even if you close the door, this still leave good gap, so your partner / colleague can hear and see everything by as good as no effort. TV has a few channels, one with decent movies and a couple of news channels in English. Little fridge and water kettle come handy. Service and cleanliness: The cleanliness of the hotel and rooms is however very good. The main lobby has a pleasant scent and the rooms are clean. I have accidentally spilled coffee in the room and the hotel wanted to charge me for cleaning the carpet. They do take this seriously. I have managed to get away without paying, but be careful as upon checkout they first check the room, before closing your bill. Hmmm,.... Bed linen and towels were clean, but towels would need soon replacement as they getting pretty thin. Service? Haven't experienced much of this, as I have spent most of the time out of the hotel, but the check-in was relatively fast (not too much friendliness though) and the check-out took ages (also due to the above mentioned). Restaurants: Haven't used. Overall: The hotel is not a bad option, if you are not spending any time in your hotel room and come here only to take a shower and sleep.

While staying there, the staff at the concierge were attentive in helping us with our luggages, calling for taxis, opening the hotel lobby doors for us, and even taxi doors though we arrived a little off the main door of the hotel late at night.

Some pros and cons of the hotel (more pros than cons): Pros: - Clean, chic and comfortable room - Cosmopolitan bath with rain shower head - Free and fast WIFI at hotel lobby - Free hourly shuttle service between hotel to Mongkok's Langham Place Mall, China Ferry Terminal (direct access to Macau) at Tsim Sha Shui, and Kowloon. - 24hour McDonald's and a small Vanguard supermarket across the street; very convenient. - Several restaurants around the area Cons: - The 5-10mins walk from Olympic MTR (Exit B) to the hotel is a major turn-off, especially when you are dead tired from a whole day out or if you lugged many shopping bags back. However, the walk is via a sheltered foot bridge and rather nice to take a slow stroll on - There is a HKD 12 charge per 24hours use of WIFI for each electronic device in the room, which was highlighted to us upfront but was miscommunicated as a one-time charge, but luckily we clarified and know it was a per day charge. This service should be made free to all staying guests. - The bathroom's glass door is too transparent and could be tinted to make it opaque. - More hangers could be provided and pillows were too soft for me to sleep comfortably", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cStayed at Cosmo Mongkok\u201d", "Author": "ksl71", "ReviewID": "UR120444166", "Content": "I was there from 4 -7 Nov 2011.

Basically, this is our third time in hongkong and we are quite dependent on our MTR octopus card. For new travelers to Hongkong, I would still recommend for you to buy the MTR Octopus card to save on money and hassle of getting coins to buy the single journey card. Okay, here is the guide: 1. For those who are extremely dependent on the MTR and are not carrying too many luggage, what you can do is just take the Airport Express Train and get off the Tsing Yi station. There is a connecting train there going to the Olympic Station, which you need to take. When you reach Olympic, get off the train and ask where is Harbour Green (it's like a condominium type building that has a network of walkways). Just take this walkway until you reach the bridge/exit to Ivy Street. Basically, this walk from the Olympic Station up to the exit of the walkway would be around 5-10 minutes depending on your walking. Upon reaching the exit, just go down the stairs (or take the lift) until you reach ground level. Walk forward Ivy street. You'll pass by some Thai restaurants, a 7-11, a MacDonald's. By the time you reach MacDonald's, you'll definitely see Cosmo. 2. You can also take the Airport Express Train. Then get off Kowloon station. Cosmo Hotel Shuttle goes there at an hour's interval. You just have to coordinate with the hotel the exact time when the shuttle bus would be there and ask them the pick up point. Anyway, the Kowloon Station has a lot of shops so you could just go around and shop awhile while waiting for the bus. The staff at Cosmo hotel are generally polite and kind. I appreciate their punctuality and fast service. If asked, whether I'll stay at Cosmo again, I probably will because of the good service, however traveling from the hotel to other parts of the city is quite a challenge. 1. You could take the MTR and reach prime destinations from the Olympic Station. 2. You could take the Cosmo Shuttle which goes around the city and has strategic drop off points: The Langham Place (where you could go to for your MongKok shopping; The China City Harbour (where the China Ferry Terminal going to Macau is) (this is also a good place to shop because of the many outlet stores); and the Kowloon Station (which is connected to shopping outlets). 3. If you like walking, you can walk to MongKok's Fa Yuen (Sporting Goods Market) in 15-30 minutes. 4. There is also a huge shopping mall at the Olympic Station which is called the Olympian.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201c3 star boutique hotel with 5 star service\u201d", "Author": "ksleong", "ReviewID": "UR120017209", "Content": "Last month, I stayed at Cosmo Mongkok Hotel for 5 days 4 nights. I book a 'free and easy' trip (flight & Accommodation & airport transfer) from my travel agent. It includes free half day city tour. I was booked initially for a 4 star hotel in Mongkok area but it was fully booked and I settled for Cosmos Mongkok. This is not my first time to Hongkong - been there many times in the past many years. But I must say that Cosmos gave me, my wife and my teenage son a wonderful experience from start to the end. Unfortunately, the gym was closed for renovation and did not have the chance to try it out and include in the review. Cosmos is a new boutique hotel, about one year old. We arrived at the hotel close to midnight. The concierge staff were waiting at the door to welcome us and carried out luggage up to the room. The registration was speedy. I guess there were not many guests checking in at that time. The room was a very pleasant surprise. When we booked the hotel, we emphasized to the travel agent that we wanted a 'big' room that can sleep three and can hold 3 x 28\" big luggage bag (for shopping spree). We were given a 'family room' - a queen size bed plus a small living room area that can accommodate a double sofa bed. The living room is cleverly partitioned by a swivel 42\" LCD TV(I think it is 42\") to get some privacy. My wife & I took the queen and my son took the sofa bed. By HK hotel standard, the space that we have gotten is very generous for a 3 star boutique hotel. It would be the space of a junior suite in a 5 star hotel. I understand later from the chambermaid that there are limited number of family room and they are always full. I peeped into one of the empty standard room and found that the extra space that I have gotten is the living area and the large space in front of the entrance. Also, my toilet and bath is very much bigger than the standard room. Another reason why the room is 'big' is that it caters to the physically challenged as well. There is ample space for wheelchair to move around and the toilet can accommodate a wheel chair comfortably. The only downside is that the wash basin is very tiny - meant for the wheelchair user to reach. Other than that every thing is fine. The decor is cosy as expected of a boutique hotel. The rooms and sheets are clean. You have to pay for wi-fi in the room. However, there is a promotion for free wi-fi in the room if you book your room online. Not to worry if the promotion is over. There is free wi-fi at the lobby. The lobby can get crowded as many guests would gather there to make use of the free wi-fi. So, bring along your netbook, notebook, smartphone and tablet. The hotel is located at the corner of the main road and side road. There is a 24 hours Mcdonald right across the road. There are several local eateries along the side road that operate till late in the night. For those who cannot read Chinese, there are photos of the food in the menu for foreigners. Ask for the English menu and confirm the food price and write it down to avoid any disputes when you are settling the bill. Basically the eateries are used to having foreigners and they are all generally honest - unlike in some other countries, Also, the eateries are manned by younger folks that can speak English. There are 2 x 24 hours 7-11 convenience store nearby - one on the main road and one near the eateries. Because of the regular car and human traffic along both roads, it is safe to move around even late at night. In the daytime, there are a few mini-marts around the hotel. So, no worries of getting hungry or thirsty at any time of the day or night. The nearest MTR station is about 15 mins walk. Cosmos provides regular shuttle bus to downtown shopping district. So, you don't have to really walk to the MTR. There are 3 stops points. Stop at sky 100 (currently the latest tallest building in HK) for luxury shopping and visit the observation tower. You get a very good 360 degree view of the whole HK. You can rent the commentary device that gives a good description of the various landmark. Another stop is the China Ferry Terminal Mall where you can catch the ferry to Macau or Zuhai. There are several branded factory outlets there. Before I forget, every Friday night, there is a laser show at the waterfront. It is a synchorisation of music, lights and laser by the many waterfront buildings. You can catch the half hour show along the Victoria Harbour or Avenue of Stars. It starts at 8 pm. Coming back to Cosmos, the concierge staff are very alert always looking out guests coming in and out of the hotel. They will always smile and greet you and hold the doors for you. They are always ready to wave down a taxi for you if you require one. I ordered some boxes of HK 'wife' biscuits to be delivered to Cosmos. The Concierge kept them for me and left a note in my room to pick up the purchase from the Conciergie. The Concierge Manager King Li (or it is Ling?) assisted me in placing order for US$ 100 worth of HK sour snacks with the vendor. I handed the HK$ equivalent to King to pass it to the Vendor. He was very professional and the order was duly delivered to the hotel with a proper receipt from the vendor. Credos to King and his team! Keep it up. There are 2 famous local chain restaurants near Cosmos. One is the popular Chinese 'tim-sum; chain and the other is the popular roast goose restaurant chain Chan Kee - both are 'must try' Chinese delicacies. The Chinese tim sum chain called 'Toh Hiang' (my own linguistic translation) does not have an English name. The restaurant is just 2 buildings away located at Old Kowloon Plaza (if I am not wrong). The tim sum and al carte menu are popular with the locals. You should try it if you have not eaten tim-sum before. For those who have eaten tim sum, you will find that their quality of food is still good and consistent. For roast goose, please steer clear of the touristy overpriced Yung Kee. I will write a review of my bad experience with Yung Kee shortly. Chan Kee was recommended to me by my HK office colleague. I asked her where do locals go for roast goose. She recommended Chan Kee to me and she was absolutely right! The standard of roast goose is good crisp pn the outside and tender on the inside. So good that I ordered one takeaway goose to take home and I hand carried the goose up the plane. Please check your customs regulations before you bring any cooked fowl home. My family had a wonderful 5 days 4 nights stay at Cosmos Mongkok plus good shopping and fine food. I would highly recommend Cosmos but make sure you secure a family room booking if you are travelling with your family.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "cardiff", "Title": "\u201cgreat rooms poor location\u201d", "Author": "rebecca m", "ReviewID": "UR119993400", "Content": "stayed for a week with a group, we had single, twin and family rooms. hotel has free shuttle bus from airport, it went around in a circle between hotel, tsimshatsui city centre and airport every hour or so. located in a poorer dirty part of city, plenty of cheap restaurants, convenient shops just opposite the road, MTR station was 15 minutes walk away, bit far in hongkong standard. hotel decor was model clean and fresh. lobby was small but uncluttered, shinny and clean. staffs were very friendly and helpful. one of us was slightly ill and stayed in, reception staff offered to call room every couple of hours to check up, followed by calling my mobile to report condition, really warm and helpful. single and twin rooms were tiny, no room for guests, amenities was basic but sufficient. bathroom has frosted glass wall, clean but way too small, comfortable bed. family room was the best, giant window with superb city view, spacious with funky decor and beautiful lighting, big tv, ipod docking station, free internet, bathroom was huge and beautifully done. very good standard for an urban hotel. never tried bar or restaurant so can't tell.", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFirst time to Hong Kong...glad we chose this hotel\u201d", "Author": "hotelexec2002", "ReviewID": "UR119875871", "Content": "The staff...are amazing!!!!

Therefore, most of the time we didn't take the free shuttle bus but a local mini bus located just opposite the corner of the road to TST MTR station and it costs HK$4.40 only. Most of their staffs are friendly except their shuttle bus driver. Reluctant to explain and guide us when we asked for direction. When we checked in the hotel, we noticed few dirty spot on the toilet floor and some hairs on the bed sheet. Not very happy to see that. However informed the housekeeping the next day and they have changed my bed sheet & apologised to us but the dirty spots still remained there until we checked out.

My partner and I stayed for five nights in a double room and found the space very adequate for two large luggages and another small one; and though the size of the rooms may seem small, Cosmo have done a very good job at utilising the space that they have e.g. bench under the window for luggage space. The bathroom was not big enough for two people to be inside, and the shower was not very well lit, but again, I thought they did the best they could with the space and the bathroom had all ammenities- all the basics plus extras like makeup remover pads. The location was a TAD far from the center of things, but the free shuttle and efficient MTR (train) system was very convenient- and if you miss a bus it costs about AUD 2.50 to get to Mongkok!

People often complain about rooms being small in city hotels, but one has to keep in mind that in Hong Kong, where space is particularly expensive getting a room larger than a closet at such a decent price is a good fortune, and actually a room in London would not be much larger, but triple the price. My room was quite large, and I was happy with the size, however. I was welcomed to a plate of fruit when I arrived, and complimentary bottled water every day, and the bathroom had a lot of nice little touches like toothbrushes and lovely smelling soap and other toiletries. The breakfast buffet consists of both western food and Asian dim sum (which I enjoyed a lot) and was included in the price of the room. The shuttle service the hotel freely provides is helpful in getting around most of Hong Kong, but I usually prefered walking, as Mong Kok station, as well as Langham shopping place are about 10 minutes away. I was provided with a map and Sophia asked me what I wanted to see and promptly marked those locations on the map for me. I warmly recommend Cosmo Hotel, especially because if you're in the area you get to see a different sight of Hong Kong. Many westerners hang out close to the sea or Central and other tourist spots and mingle only with other westerners, but if you go a few hundred meters inland, there is a lot more to be discovered.

A simply \"overbooked\" reply and their policy to travel agency for such request is subjected to availability. Process should be better streamlined as such request are important to the guest. It should not just limit servicing request and booking made direct through the hotel website. 2. Limited TV channels 3. The design of the basin easily cause water to splash onto self. 4. The lift system has to improve its efficiency. (I have no suggestion on how thou) 5. Rooms near the lift might get a bit noisy (depends on the other guests) 6. The pillows are too soft.

I was not given anything. Even the still advertised free use of a notebook and iPad was not given to us when we asked. Even though the Executive Lounge was not included... we were able to see how horrible it was with the door left ajar. There wasn't anything inside at all and no working staff was to be found.

The staff (in kooky uniforms) are very friendly and have good English). There's no two ways about it, the room was small. For \u00a3700 (8 nights), I had expected a little more room to manoeuvre. The bed could only be accessed comfortably from one side. Staying for a week was not thoroughly catered-for, as there was nowhere to store our cases. For the price, I had also expected breakfast, but it was an extra $110 each, and the staff in the dining room were curt, the food unexceptional. There was a small fridge stocked with the basics. There was a TV with a football channel, which pleased him, but not much else in English (but we weren't on the other side of the world to watch the telly). The bathroom was enclosed by a curved glass wall with a sliding door. The novelty of this coupled with the excessive mirrors (presumably to enlarge the 'feel' of the space; in reality meant you could see each other on the toilet, even with the door closed, from anywhere in the room) wore off after about 3 hours. The shower was lovely, with a giant head which meant the water fell like rain. There was also a good safe in the room (not that it was really required). There was a horrible smell from the drains, but maybe this was room-specific. We should have complained, but were unsure that our problem would translate without seeming rude. On the first night, I asked for an ice bucket, to which the porter said 'yes, certainly', but it failed to materialise. We also got a rather rude phone call from housekeeping asking if we were ever going to go outside so they could clean up our room. On the last night, we even received a wake-up call we hadn't asked for at 8am, which wasn't great, as we planned to sleep til just before check-out, as we returned from Macau the night before at around 3am. The hotel lobby and lifts/corridors were superbly decorated and fanatically clean, but I did find a peanut under the bed (not ours), which put me off a bit. The nearest metro is Olympic City, which is about 6 mins away, and there are some great restaurants (McDonalds aside) locally. We also found a good bar with lots of display cabinets with turtles in! Easy walking distance from Mong Kok station past interesting local food markets, and also a short walk from Golden Computer Arcade & market environs (including vendors of both jade and goldfish). In all, the hotel was in a good location to see the more exciting side of local life. It's not such a far walk from the metro, and the pavements are slightly less frenetic than the more popular tourist areas. This also means you can find a variety of cheap local chow. The room wasn't big, but we didn't go to stay in the room. Another couple of square feet and it would have been good for a week. Standard rooms are more suitable for executives - if you're staying any longer, I'd recommend the next size up.

I was really disappointed when I arrived, but I became accustomed to this and for one person this was ok. Similar to some other HK hotels, but did not expect for new place. The bed could only be accessed from one side and the TV was wall mounted to make some room. The decor was well done to offset the tiny space and I decided I could cope for short term visit. I had two disappointments. I set the temperature for 28 to try and warm up the chilly room, but discovered it was colder. I finally decided the heat was broken and called for help. They sent a space heater and I later learned from other reviews that apparently the hotel does not have heat!. For 10 months this is fine. I am very disappointed that this is not somehow high lighted when you arrive to check in or in the room. Other shock was the new building under construction outside my window.

Overall - for the price I paid (HKD 1000+) I was not impressed with no heat, and construction noise. Also a HKD $120 charge for internet was also too much for my tolerance.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel and if I get a similar rate, I may stay here again.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pune, India", "Title": "\u201cA hotel with good facilities and Awesome Food\u201d", "Author": "Rajat289", "ReviewID": "UR87687728", "Content": "THe Cosmo Kawloon Hotel is one of the most clean hotel I have ever seen.

Room had 2 beds and was tiny. I was by myself in the room and didn't need the extra bed. The window sill serves as luggage storage space or counter, but there were 3 strands of long hair there. I didn't touch that part of the room area, and was grossed out. Bathroom had a sewage smell. \"desk\" area\" if you could call it that, was so small. Bathroom was tiny. No sink counter space. Absolutely no space for personnal toiletries if you're a woman forget about where you can put your make up. Housekeeping starts a 7am and they were SOOOO noisy. I complaint about the hair and noise and they moved me up to the 22nd floor, which is a better room with one double bed. Better desk space, and a pretty great view of the city. Bathroom had less of a sewage pipe smell (still a bit there though). Housekeeping starts about 9am on this higher floor. Still VERY noisy once they start, so if you stay here, you better not be looking for decent sleep-ins. Location is not convenient. Many blocks away from MTR. Ok if you come from places where you're used to walking a lot. But since I had a lot of errands to run, I don't have time for that and took taxis a lot. Fitness center is still being built. Elevators are small and very sloooooow. They hotel website claims they guaranteed the lowest internet rate but Expedia has cheaper rates. This Cosmo is affiliated with the Cosmo on the HK side. The 2 are at vastly different locations. Hotel staff was generally very nice. Still, for the same price, I'd recommend the Park Hotel or Butterfly on the Prat in Tsim Tsa Tsui. Same poor qualities but much much better locations.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cosmo Hotel Mongkok", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1235711-Reviews-Cosmo_Hotel_Mongkok-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$103 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.88 Tai Kok Tsui Road, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1235711", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/ae/8b/67/filename-cmk-jpg-thumbnail0.jpg"}}
