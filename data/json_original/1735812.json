To be honest, the hotel is quite small and the location is not perfect. From the airport we have to take the airport bus to Taksim, then the funicular to Kabatas and then change the tram to Karakoy. But the hotel is just about 10-min walk from the tram station which we found it acceptable. We received a warm welcome and a complimentary cold drink when we were checking-in at the reception. The nice bellboy helped us to carry our baggages to our room and patiently introduced the facilities inside, as well as the tourist attractions nearby. The room was not spacious but very clean, and we were lucky to have a seaview room! We did not have our lunch yet when we arrived so we headed to the roof-top restaurant. The view there is so amazing that you would just want to sit there for the whole day facing the other side of Istanbul. The food and drinks served there are also not pricey, even cheaper than some of the restaurants in Sultanahmet. We went there again the same night after sightseeing and enjoyed the night view so much.

This was based off price, location, and amenities. What more can you look for when you know very little about a new place? My fianc\u00c3\u00a9s friend had stayed at The Golden City Hotel once and he told us that it was a great hotel that he could relax in peace at the end of each busy day. I have to say that this was a large influence in our decision. My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I definitely agreed that we will stay there again if/when we go back to Turkey! I would definitely recommend The Golden City Hotel to anyone looking for a hotel in Istanbul. First of all, the check in process was quick and seamless and all of the staff members were very professional, helpful and friendly! We were escorted up to our room by a very friendly bell boy (who carried our luggage with a smile). After we reserved the room through a travel agency, my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 contacted the hotel directly and asked for the largest bed that they have and we arrived to our room to find the largest bed (vs. a French bed). Our single request had already been taken care of prior to our arrival. We had traveled all day and we were hungry but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go out. This hotel has a fabulous restaurant on the 10th floor. It also has an amazing view of the sea and the city. After we got settled into our room, we decided to try this restaurant. The food was so flavorful and delicious!! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a little snack restaurant. You can order real food like steak. They also have a full bar if you want a drink. It was clear that the chiefs take pride in the meals they prepare! The food was very tasty and it offered perfect portions. The sauce was incredible and the steak was tender, high quality and cooked perfectly. I asked for a drink with dinner and that, too, was perfect. The dinner was a very pleasing way to end the day of travel. And when we were done, we only needed to take the elevator and we were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchome\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We slept like babies. We never heard any sounds through the walls in this hotel. There was also a small safe in our room in which we were able to keep things like our original passports and extra money. In the morning we went back up to the restaurant on the 10th floor and ate our complimentary breakfast. They had a variety of meats, cheeses, fresh fruit and vegetables, cereal, fresh coffee and tea, yogurt, Danishes, olives, boiled eggs and fresh bread loaves with a toaster. Needless to say, we went up there for breakfast each morning. I have to add that the restaurant staff kept a close eye on the food to ensure that nothing ran out prior to the breakfast end time of 10:30am. Of course, you do not spend the majority of your time in your hotel room when you are on a vacation. We were out all day and most of the night. But when we returned to the hotel, we were always greeted with friendly smiles and everyone ensured we had everything we needed. They even recommended places we should visit and handed us the fliers. Mr. Ali (the manager) even called and booked one of tours to the Prince\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Island. He was able to communicate in the native Turkish language and he ensured that we got the best rate. He also recommended a Turkish Night Tour, which turned out to be so much fun! My daughter became ill in America and Mr. Ali was also ever so kind to fax the consent form for me from the hotel to my sister in America, so she could take my daughter to the doctor. He consistently provided more than 100% customer service. The Golden City Hotel is located within walking distance to the Galata Tower and Istkalal Street (this street is the pathway to Taksim Square.) Our sincere gratitude goes out to all of the staff at this hotel! Everyone was so friendly and professional. This includes all the bell boys, restaurant staff, housekeeping, Ms. Durdane at the front desk and the hotel manager, Mr. Ali! It was extremely pleasing to be greeted in this new Country by such wonderful hospitality! We really cannot say enough positive things to express our gratitude! PS: Ms. Durdane also called a legitimate taxi to pick us up from our hotel and take us to the Istanbul airport for our departure. (When in Turkey, you will realize that a legitimate taxi with a meter is not the norm.) Thank you so much for making our hotel feel more like a home. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see you next time.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cView from rooftop Restaurant is the only good thing about this hotel\u201d", "Author": "NCWorldTraveler1963", "ReviewID": "UR127621602", "Content": "The hotel is located in the hardware section of Istanbul with very little around it.

The Tunel is a short 200m walk from the hotel and costs 3lira single, 5 return. the Tunel tram stops quite early, so if having a night out you prefer to take a taxi back.

The Galata and Beyoglu districts are a short walk up a (steep) hill from the hotel, and, the main historic attractions are a short walk across one of two nearby bridges, that link this side of the Golden Horn, with that where those attractions are located (namely, the Sultanahmet, etc). The hotel itself, is located along a busy light-industrial street, with a small but attractive and contemporary reception/lobby. The staff are very friendly and attentive, and generally speak a decent level of English. Your luggage is likely to be delivered to your room, on arrival at the hotel (you may wish to offer a 'tip' for this). The most amazing feature of the hotel, is the rooftop terrace/restaurant and bar. When we holidayed in this hotel (June 2011), nine of the ten breakfasts (decent choice of food), were served on this rooftop facility. The most amazing panoramic views of the ancient city can be seen from up there! The room we had was fairly spacious, but above all, very clean and serviced with air-conditioning. An all-round, very good experience, in a beautiful and exciting city!", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cJust perfect for a Romantic and Interesting City Trip to Istanbul & more ...!!\u201d", "Author": "MMinIstanbul", "ReviewID": "UR117830736", "Content": "For our wedding in Istanbul we were trying to find a place to accommodate our guests from around the world - easy to reach from the airport, still in the city centre to reach the main spots to show them this beautiful city even by a short walk, large enough rooms to make them feel comfortable and dress up, not too expensive to scare them off, nice surrounding and a perfect view ... all this together AND for a reasonable price is usually impossible ... but we were searching and searching and found this perfect place - including warm, friendly and caring staff - just perfect - I cannot recommend it more ... plus ... you cannot beat this view ... and it's every morning for breakfast, every evening for maybe having dinner up there or whenever you want to enjoy a perfect view over Istanbul.

The personnel is very friendly and helpful, eager to answer to any question at any time. The rooms are very clean and cozy. The bathroom is also clean, there is a spacious shower with a built-in glass door. The view from the rooms is fantastic, the Golden Horn lies in front of you, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, S\u00c3\u00bcleymaniye Camii and the bridges create a spectacular view, especially at night. The rooms on the 9th floor are named after the sight to which they provide optimal view, for example Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Golden Horn, etc. We stayed in 904 Hagia Sophia and the view was unforgettable. The price of the rooms is in my opinion reasonable, considering what they offer. The restaurant on the 10th floor terrace is a great place to relax at night after a long sightseeing day having dinner or just a drink with a panoramic view of the Golden Horn. There are heaters and the staff brings you blankets to cover yourself in case you feel cold. The food is quite nice and you can pay in the end of your stay at the reception. Even if you choose not to stay in this hotel, the restaurant is still a nice place to visit and take some memorable photos! Also there is a very funny (in a good way of course) guy working there, Fatih, who can make your evening even more pleasant with his humour! By the way, the bar on the ground floor, next to the reception, was quite expensive, for example a bottle of water was even more expensive than the one of the room's mini bar! The hotel is conveniently located very close (500 meters) to a tram stop (Karak\u00c3\u00b6y). This is very helpful, as tram (and not metro) is the main means of transportation in the city that takes you to most of the interesting places (Sultanahmet square with Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace, Archaeological Museum, Kapal\u00c4\u00b1 \u00c3\u2021ar\u00c5\u0178\u00c4\u00b1, Egyptian Market, all places one must definetely visit). It's a short, straight walk so even if you are carrying luggage it is easy to do it, you just have to pass in front of some small shops on a sometimes narrow pavement. The Galata Tower is a short (400 m) but uphill walk from the hotel, the view from the top of the tower however is rewarding! If you want to reach Taksim Square, you have to take the tram all the way to the last stop (Kabata\u00c5\u0178) and then pay an extra ticket to get on the funicular for just one stop. Once you are there, you can walk all the way down \u00c4\u00b0stikl\u00c3\u00a2l Cad and from its end, the hotel is just an easy downhill walk. If you want to go to the airport (or the International Bus Terminal) you have to use tram and metro. If you are carrying luggage prefer to take the tram all the way and change at Zeytinburnu instead of changing at Yusufpa\u00c5\u0178a where you have to walk up and down the stairs 3 times (there are no rolling ladders!) and walk a significant distance. Public transportation is definetely a much cheaper way of reaching the airport, rather than taxi, but allow yourself enough time (about 2 h), as the tram might move slowly downtown during rush hour. The hotel receptionists, although eager to help, don't seem to know much about public transportation so prefer using a map instead of asking them. Generally, I would say that Istanbul Golden City Hotel is a great option for someone to stay and explore the city, combining both nice services and spectacular view!", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durban, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "ZA111111", "ReviewID": "UR111343792", "Content": "The hotel is excellent located in Beyagulu area.

The biggest problem was the location. It's been thanked here, but probably because of the view. But the hotel is located between the bay and a large street with no restaurants very close. In the night it was a rather uncomfortable walk in dark&quiet street (and in most cases uphill) to the restaurants. We ended up taking taxies quite often, which can also be a problem as the drivers don't like short rides and tend to cheat...

No problems to report at all, friendly staff, decent breakfast and excellent panoramic views over the Bopsphorous from our 6th floor room. I see other reviewers have commented on the location. Yes, it is in a seemingly out of the way street (in what must be the street to come to if you are a DIY enthusiast!) but do not be fooled! We felt perfectly safe and the location was ideal for exploring the 'new' part of town around the Galata (?) Tower district on the hotel side of the river and the 'old' town across the bridge (15mins walk). I'm sure Istanbul is a lot larger than this in total but for our short break these areas gave us more than enough to do. We found the immediate area outside the hotel came to life during the day with the vibrant DIY shops / markets in close proximity to the fish market, anglers and restaurants that line the bridge. We had a great trip and the hotel was good value and ideally located (and we have stayed in some dodgy hotels in the past!) so thumbs up to the Golden City.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "Wildy29", "ReviewID": "UR99047977", "Content": "We had a pleasant time at this hotel although due to it's location it wasn't great.
