The room on the 7th floor was regularly sized (I expect more for the price) though designed very well, it was new or so I was told. The room also smelled wonderful, my wife whose nose is very discerning was quite happy about this. I loved the bathroom, it was spacious, clean with good water pressure. Luckily we didn't get the noisy room from the renov they're doing like so many others have said here, we were loving the balcony even though the view was abysmal. The bed was comfortable BUT it was not king size. King is 180x200 cm, the bad was clearly 160x200 ( yes, I took the time to measure it). As the result,... my wife nearly kicked me out off bed at 3 in the morning. The amenities were by Bvlgari, a standard for an upmarket hotel. Location was \"awesome\" everything was within walking distance. Chanel boutique downstairs, I thought i mentioned that, because branded fashion boutiques choose their location very carefully. Now....when I checked out there was a charge of 14 Euros for minibar, which I inquired because I never took anything from minibar. turned out it was for the coffee capsules they have in the room, yes they have nespresso machine which was a delight, but they didn't tell us that they're going to charge for the capsules at a very high price. There was a nespresso shop just across the street, I would have bought my coffee capsules there if I knew they were charging for coffee in the room. Charging for coffee in the room? tchk tchk tchk...seriously idiotic for a hotel this caliber. Alright, room was nice, a little larger would be better, bathroom was great, balcony was great, I thought the room rate I paid included breakfast but apparently not, I don't know who's fault is that. Luckily, there's a nice cafe just around the corner. All in all, as my wife and I usually said to each other when things are so-so, OK OK laaaaaahh.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New City", "Title": "\u201cMajestic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "LindajNewCity", "ReviewID": "UR128165537", "Content": "Please be aware that they are doing construction at The Majestic and it was very loud.

I'm not intending to write war and peace on this one so here are the +'s and -'s... Positives.. We had a double deluxe premium that was a well appointed room, nice furnishings, good sized bathroom, good tv, comfortable bed, loads of storage, safe, dressing gowns, slippers, overlooked a backstreet - awful view but quiet. Efficient reception staff - good concierge that recommended a good restaurant within 10mins of the hotel Location is awesome - you couldn't be better placed - in walking distance of all the main 'must do's in Barcelona. Roof bar area is small and the pool is tiny but it has great views of the City and is a great place to relax in the evening after a long day of sightseeing and unwind with a drink. Negatives: Astronomically priced - they charged for everything - 2 drinks at the bar one evening was \u20ac28! You had to pay for the coffees in the room - they were \u20ac3.85 each and what made that worse was the house keeping didn't replensih the sugars or milks every day. Wi-fi wasnt free, even in the lobby - we were told an outside company runs iit for the hotel and they charge - we didn't ask how much - we were too afraid. We paid \u20ac80 for two sandwiches, 3 beers and 2 glasses of cava... We actually went to the Mandarin Oriental one night down the road and their bar was awesome and cheaper! No idea what the restaurant was like as we opted not to eat there - we looked in one night at about half 8 and there was one person in there - we opted for a bar meal which was actually pretty good but it is hard to get a club sandwich wrong. Service was hit and miss - if you were in the right place at the right time you would get served promptly and with a smile, otherwise you had to throw yourself in front of the waiter/ barman to get their attention. We waited on the roof bar for 30mins to get served one afternoon - not helped that the poor waitress seemed to have to go down 10 storeys to get the drinks back up to the roof bar - there's a bar up there but maybe too early on in the season for them to open it yet there were a lot of guests up there. One time on the roof I ordered a beer and before I had even finished it i was told quite rudely by the waitress that I needed to pay for it now. I didnt argue and had no problem, but i was planning on having another as were due to leave and had half an hour to kill but after her attitude we promptly left. Steam room/ sauna are not complimentary and there is a charge - again, too afraid to ask. We ate over the road every morning and got a cappucino and chocolate croissant for 2 for about \u20ac10 - again, didn't want to be over charged for eating in the restaurant downstairs - dont know how much it cost but breakfast in the room varied from about \u20ac20 to about \u20ac40 dependent on what you ordered. I'm by no means tight but we felt these charges were disproportionate to the experience. This is a good 4 star hotel with a nice relaxed feel to it but it needs to sharpen up its service and look at its pricing.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cNot 5 star service\u201d", "Author": "Padster1", "ReviewID": "UR127578224", "Content": "I have given this hotel 4 stars overall predominately for the location and quality of the room, be aware this is no way a 5 star Hotel. We have stayed in numerous 5star hotels across the world and this was our third trip to Barcelona but our 1st stay at The Majestic. We stayed over Easter so they may have been busy but on arrival at check in the staff were almost rude, showed no interest in us just said sign here and gave us the key. No introduction about the hotel and facilities, I had to ask where breakfast was and how much. When we were finally taken to our room despite requesting a king size bed we had twin beds and as we were tired we didn't make a fuss but the porter said they would sort it the next day - they didnt! However a nice touch was the bottle of cava that was in the room to celebrate our Anniversary. The following day we arrived back from a day of sightseeing and shopping to find our room had not been serviced - at 4.30 pm! When I called housekeeping they said we have until 5pm to do it - no apology. We decided to go up to the roof top bar for a glass of wine whilst they were cleaning the room and there were a number of people up there as the weather was glorious but a lack of any staff to take orders, my husband had to go inside and call from the Spa for someone to come up, this took a long time. It's not really what you would expect of a hotel supposedly 5 stars. Breakfast in the restaurant was 19E each - don't bother there is a lovely cafe across the road with delicious coffee, fresh orange and pastries at a fraction of the price. Again on price it is outrageous that you are charged for a capsule of coffee in the room, 5 star hotels provide this for free - there is a nespresso shop across the road from the hotel and 12 capsules costs the same as 1 from room service! To top it all on Saturday my husband tried to book a restaurant with the conceirge for our anniversary but he was on the phone and waved his hand at us. One of the check in staff said he would do it, took the details said he would call us to let us know and guess what no call! When my husband went down to enquire the response was they were full but again no apology as to why he didn't let us know or even a recommendation for somewhere else which is what most hotels of this standard would do. My husband was furious and another guest in reception at the same time was also complaining about the shocking service.

It is not 5 stars GL hotel. It is very good 4 stars or average 5. Main downfall is unfriendliness of staff. In general there is no friendly smiles and not very tidy looking uniforms. All this putting down hotel rate at list one star lower. We are always staying in 5 star properties and I noticed that it is staff that mainly makes your stay, not even hotel facilities. In a hotel like this you expect to be recognised and looked after. It seems that staff in Majestic was never trained to do so. The only person who was very helpful was a concierge who directed us to restaurants and other places. Hotel facilities are not bad. It is very clean. Room is very very small, but has a good size bathroom and nice bath products bathrobes and slippers. Room has good flat TV and coffee machine, but this is where the problems started. Tv kept loosing signal every half minute. When I rang receptions twice, nobody came and fixed it, so we had no Tv. We used a coffee machine and only at check out we find out that you have to pay for coffee 3.50! It is not clearly stated unless you look at the bar price list, so be beware . Shortly after arriving we went to have a look at spa and pool and we never came back. Pool is tiny and it is on the open air and water is not heated, so it is not useful unless you are there on summer. Internet wifi is outragely expensiv, 15 euro per day. Breakfast was ok. Food nice enough but very limited choice for this range of properties. Worst part about it was that staff would never approach you with tea or coffee. You actually have to run after waiter yourself and ask him to bring you whatever you need. I never saw it anywhere else. Good point is location. This street is one of the best to stay in Barcelona.

It is a clean hotel with great service. All of the staff that we encountered from Front Desk, Consierge, Housekeeping, Room Service, Spa, etc. were really wonderful, friendly and helpful. If they cannot speak English, they will find a staff member who does (most of them do speak English though) We've traveled several places in Europe and the US over the years and by far the Hotel Majestic has the BEST shower of anywhere we've stayed...a rain shower with lots of water pressure! The only way it could have been better was with jets on the walls. The marble bathrooms were well appointed and the mirror doesn't fog up. The room itself was very clean, comfortable beds, TV, wireless internet (for a daily fee), mini bar, safe, separate little walk in closet. Our room was tucked away and had skylights instead of windows, which I actually liked because the noise level from the street was a little lower. (everyone else we traveled with had windows) This is not say it was a noisy hotel, it's just right in the city and noise is to be expected. The location is great for getting around on foot, trendy upscale shopping around the hotel (Gucci, Channel, Hermes, etc), a small cafe across the street and many restaurants within walking distance. Taxis were very reasonably priced and easy to get. The hotel itself has a Michelin Star restaurant, but we did not get a chance to try it out this visit. Up the street a few blocks was a great restaurant if you crave something familiar- Da Greco Italian restaurant. Very friendly, great Italian food and they often give samples for the table to try. If you happen to hear of a restaurant called Dontell (has a laundry storefront and was told to us to be a hip trendy place by the locals) DO NOT GO THERE. Not sanitary or ethical in the kitchen (which you can see openly with the glass walls) That's all I'll say on that one. Avoid! The rooftop is where the spa is located. I've been to better hotel spas, this one was simple...but they do their best with what they have. There is a SMALL rooftop pool and bar. Great views of the city though and others that we traveled with frequented that area at night for a drink and cigar. Overall a very comfortable, convenient, clean visit at the Hotel Majestic.

The first 2 nights were spent with friends in a triple Junior Suite which was huge by any standards. It had the most enormous bathroom with 2 showers which was perfect for 3 girls! No complaints whatsoever. Following the 2 night stay, I then moved into a deluxe premium room on a double occupancy basis as my husband had flown in to join me and the hotel had no junior suites available. This room was pretty small but perfectly equipped in every way with a good sized bathroom. The best thing about this room was the stunning Japanese style balcony with a sofa set and plenty of room for sunbathing! Stunning!! Do note that we stayed on the 7th floor on the NEW side of the hotel....there is a 7th floor on the old side which is nowhere as nice so make sure you specify to the hotel that you want the new side. However, I must comment on the noticeably slack service received in the Rooftop Bar and the lobby lounge....not 5 star by most standards and the waiters did not speak English at all. On one occasion, we were seated at a table but not served for 30 mins...we left without drinks and were not asked why we were leaving. However, the views from the Rooftop Bar made up for any faults and one of the day waiters was very generous in refilling our champagne flutes without charge when he had accidentally spilled a glass on our table. Also, the check in time is 3pm which can be pretty inconvenient for early flight arrivals. I would advise leaving your luggage with the concierge, popping into the 10th floor spa where you can freshen up and enjoy a drink and snack at the Rooftop Bar before popping out for lunch at the nearby Tapa Tapa (to the left of the hotel on the Paseig de Gracia) and probably the best tapas bar in the whole of Barcelona! Also, check out time at the hotel is 11am but you can request a free check out up to 1pm if they are not busy. The buffet breakfast was great - all the usual suspects including comp cava which was a nice Spanish touch. The only other thing that bothered us slightly was the rather brash, abrupt manner of the front reception staff but, with hindsight, we feel that may just have been the 'Spanish' way! They came across as rushed as they were very busy when we checked in and not very welcoming. The location of the hotel was unbeatable - right in the centre of the city within easy walking distance to Placa Catalunya and La Rambla. The hop on / hop off touristic bus stop was a few steps from the hotel (to the right) and, for the ladies & interested gents, the Chanel boutique is located next door to the hotel with Gucci & LV right after that!

Our room was on the 7th floor center front of hotel, it was a pretty nice view. The room was ok and I say this because it had older carpet and looked a little run down but to be expected in an older hotel, I guess? The beds were two twins pushed together (not ideal for couples wanting to snuggle) but were comfortable. My understanding this is normal for Europeans. You could not sit in bed to long without it moving (bed is on wheels) away from the wall.

Too bad that the owners of the hotel are not backing their employees up by reinvesting in the facilities.

The air conditioner in the room was set to maximum air flow and minimum temperature throughout our stay. However, the airflow on the hot days was pitiful and it reduced to zero on the two cold days. I approached the front reception managers twice and was told on the second occasion that the air conditioning system was switched off completely because the temperature outside was cool. There was NO airflow available from the system - not even fresh air from outside. In fairness the double glazed windows could be opened but this was impractical for two reasons: 1) the noise from the street below was very loud with the window open and it continued all night; 2) each part of the double glazed windows opened separately and awkwardly, with no way of setting the opening or stopping the two frames from bumping into one other. It is obviously not expected that guests should open the windows. At the price one would expect to be able to set air flow volume and temperature all year round.

However, there is of course the A/C but it was too cold for that. I couldn't believe that in an international hotel, there was no English speaking channels on the TV. Only when I asked reception they told me that I had to press another button to obtain English, but no one bothered to tell me this before. The reception/concierge were all helpful and spoke excellent English, but the rest of the staff did not. In fact, I don't think they really want to speak English. We asked for a hot chocolate in the bar and what came can only be descibed as Chocolate sauce. It was exactly what you would get on chocolate cake or profiteroles. Far too thick and sweet. I asked for some hot milk to go with it which they charged for and only when half the contents had been porured away was it mildly drinkable. The restaurant downstairs leaves a lot to be desired as far as ambience and decor is concerned. It's all OK for breakfast but definitely not for an evening meal. The portions although tasty, are very small. As for breakfast, as with all hotels these days, there is a buffet where one serves themselves. The only thing the staff has to do is serve tea and coffee but as ususal they're more interested in getting your room number and having private chats amongst themselves. They really didn't make you feel welcome. Not a smile was seen on any of their faces.

Then arose our first problem. The flatscreen television would not work. I immediately contacted the front reception who promptly sent an engineer up to investigate, he wiggled the wire about and it started working, BUT, then it was temperamental and I had to fix the cable another FIVE TIMES to get a clear picture. I am an avid football supporter and there was an important game in progress, therfore I was obviously not very happy. We proceeeded to go to La Ramblas, on reception we were advised to ''get a taxi'' this cost me 6 Euros (why wasn't i informed that La Ramblas was only a five minute walk away. This brings me to my second complaint/problem. The following morning (Monday March 8th 2010) we were woken at approximately 0900 hours, by very loud banging, what sounded like building work on the room above. (my fiancee was asleep and feeling unwell) looking to have a nice relaxing morning to get over the flight and the night before, only to be woken by this very loud banging, which went on for approximately one hour. Until at this point, I went to the front reception and complained. At this point I was informed that we could be re-located to the sixth floor to room number 628. Obviously, without even thinking about it, I accepted straight away. Then, we were dissapointed to find the resulting room was smaller and the bathroom was a lot smaller and not as nice as our previous room! (But at least the TV worked) Just when we thought things were getting better, exactly the same thing happened the following morning. Building work started at approximately 0900 hours. A banging (not as violently loud as the previous night) but still an audiable banging noise. So I went to the front reception to ask what was going on, to be told ''Maintenance work''. As we were quite fed up by now, we had a day out in BCN. As we had everything as we wanted it (in the room) I left a hanger on the door handle which read 'do not disturb/no need to clean room'. We arrived back on the night (Tuesday March 9th 2010) only to find that all our belongings had been re-arranged, with that thing you put on our bed EVERY NIGHT to pressure people into purchasing your very over priced breakfast. So my Fiancee went looking for her beloved night gown, we searched high and low for her night dress. Literally turned the room upside down. She was very, very upset. Low and behold, I went to the front reception to ask what the cleaner had done with her night gown. To be told that that our bed sheets were now with a '3rd party' company, therefore, there wasn't anyone could do about it!! Due to the fact that our flight departing in the early hours of Wednesday morning, I decided enough was enough and went to console my very upset fiancee. To evaluate what I have explained above. I am deeply upset in the attitude your staff have at HOTEL MAJESTIC.

It was between that and Hotel 1898. Majestic won because it looked like it had a nicer gym, other reviews said the location was great, the roof bar looked great, and it sounded like the sauna/steam room were included. The verdict? It was OK. But we really wish we would have stayed at 1898 instead. Room: Decent. Smaller than rooms than in the U.S., but not bad...but should be bigger for the price. We had a standard room, which faced the back of the hotel. Bathroom had a hair dryer (i think?), a bidet, nice size tub with shower...but there was always a stench like the sewage had backed up. Nothing else really to say about the room. Bar/Restaurants: We only had coffee at the bar, and everything was twice as expensive as anywhere else you could go. Breakfast started at 23 euro/person for a very basic breakfast. Ridiculous. And, the roof bar was never open. Pretty views, but nobody was there. and the weather was too cool to use the pool. Gym: a few treadmills, a recumbent bike, upright bike, elliptical, dumb bells and a multipurpose weight machine. there were two plasma t.v.'s to watch. There was a men's and women's bathroom connected, each with a shower. The big disappointment was that I thought the sauna and steam room were connected to the gym. I looked everywhere online to figure that out, and couldn't. Spa: it never said on the website, and some reviews said they were complimentary, but you had to pay for the sauna and steam room. It was 15 euros for 30 minutes. and you had to reserve a time because it's private. there's a steam room, sauna, hot/cold stream programmable shower and a regular shower. no bathrooms, though...strange. We used this \"5 star hydrotherapy\" room after a massage. Wasn't anything too special, though. My massage was great...the wife's was not. Hotel 1898's spa area looked awesome, and it was complimentary. Location: the hotel is right in the middle of the high-end shopping district, which we could care less about. We wanted to experience some Barcelona culture. Everything is in walking distance if you have the time...but getting to La Rambla takes about 15-20 minutes. There are a couple of Gaudi builings a block away, which were nice to see. And lots of restaurants and cafes. But the restaurants and cafes near La Rambla were always much cheaper, the stores more authentic...and La Rambla had local artisans selling their wares (jewelry, art, food), and La Boqueria Mercat (Market) is on La Rambla and is great. Lots of fresh fruit, fish, chocolate...and a few places to sit down for a meal. We also could walk to Sagrada Familia from the hotel in a reasonable amount of time. But we took the metro up to Gaudi's Parc Guell. The metro from the airport drops you off less than a block from the hotel, which was great. We couldn't go to the airport on the metro since it doesn't start running until 5:30am and we had an earlier flight so had to take a cab for 31 euro. If you want to see the beach, it's nice - huge waves. Don't think it's a nude beach, but a guy sat down near us and dropped trou. it's a good 15 minute walk south of La Rambla Nearby restaurants: a block or two south have a couple of cafes where we had breakfast most mornings - usually 2 cafes con leche and a pastry or sandwhich...for about 5 euros. There's a great restaurant a couple of blocks away - Cerverceria Catalana: excellent tapas and cheap bottles of wine. Another one, Ciudad Condal, is just south of it, but is almost identical...just a little more expensive. just walk around and look at menus and prices to see what you want. we tried a different one every lunc and dinner...except certain lunches where we just bought a bocadillo (sandwich) and smoothie from the market. I have a lot more i could write about what not/to do, where not/to go...but i'll stop for now. Bottom line: you won't be disappointed staying here...but if you're looking for more authentic interaction with Barcelona, and nearby more than just shopping, look for places a little more south, on or near La Rambla and south of Placa Catalunya.

One thing you need to know that the front desk did not tell me, is that you can get free wifi in the business center downstairs, complementary with your stay, but if you get it in your room, you get charged A LOT (hourly or every 24 hours). I'd paid for wifi for two days before someone told me it was free in the center. I stayed in many hotels in more remote places than Barcelona, and all of them offered free wifi in the room.

As it was our Honeymoon and the first time we had been to Barcelona, i wanted to make the trip momentous - a truly wonderful experience we would treasure for years to come...hopefully for the rest of our lives together! With this in mind - i contacted the Head of Reservations at the Majestic a few weeks in advance - explaining our circumstances - and asked that the Hotel would hopefully help me in my wish to make the Honeymoon a memorable experience. On our arrival we discovered we had booked into the Catalonian capital, quite by accident, at one of the busiest times of the year with La Merce festival running all week. As we checked in, i spoke to Emilio (concierge) and told him i had been in contact with the hotel prior to our arrival....disappointingly, he informed me that our room was not ready - and asked if we would mind waiting in the bar area while our reservation was completed - there we were treated to a complimentary coffee. A short while later, Emilio re-appeared to show us to our room. To our absolute delight he took us to an up-graded suite, with a balcony view over Paseo Gracia (one of the liveliest and best shopping streets) and informed us that our stay had also been up-graded from Room-only to Bed and Champagne Breakfast for the duration of our stay . A short time later, room service delivered fresh flowers, fresh strawberries dipped in chocolate, and complimentary bottle of vintage champagne. To say we were taken aback was an understatement! From first setting foot in the opulent foyer to finally checking out of the Majestic Hotel - i can only say, we were treated like royalty. The staff were courteous, pleasant, helpful and diligent through-out....the restaurant waiting-staff were superb (including maitre d) and the servicing and cleaning of our room was exceptional. The concierge (as already mentioned) went out of his way to liaise with us through-out our stay - and any request was met with smiles and a positive attitude which we were extremely impressed with; then promptly satisfied by the staff. The location of the Hotel Majestic is good (metro and bus-stops directly outside), the decor and surroundings were sumptuous and to find fault anywhere would be churlish in the extreme. As for Barcelona - my wife and i were totally enthralled by the beauty, vivacity, colour, spectacle and friendliness of the place. I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending the Majestic to a friend, nor would i have any hesitation in returning again. And (while i appreciate that our romantic interlude may have coloured the impression of our stay slightly) we intend to do just that - return again!

The entire night, doors slammed shut as workers entered and left the service room (labled as office) next to us. After nicely requesting a room without mold and removed from a service \"office\" we were moved without question to a room on the 6th floor. The bed was made of 2 singles pushed together without a bridging device. This room was more on the level of a worn suburban Marriott. Stained carpet, mold in the tile grout, scuffed walls, etc but it had a window. The same door slamming noise (and I mean enough to wake you from a sound sleep) was experienced but I believe this is due to the cheap hinges - that means any door closing near your room will result in a loud booming sound. We did not get much rest at all the entire stay. The roof top pool was a joke. It's not a pool, its an oversized soaking tub that is in the middle of an outdoor bar/lounge. We saw families come up in their robes to use the pool only to realize they were in the midst of well dressed people having $18 evening cocktails. And the view.... was not that great.

We were concerned by the many allusions to tiny, dark and very run down rooms. However we had to book at Hotel Majestic because the other family we were traveling with really wanted this hotel. So we were pleasantly surprised!! First the location is absolutely perfect. In the best area, you just walk out of the hotel and you are in the center of all the action, be it to visit the city, for restaurant and bars or for shopping. Second, the check-in was very smooth. Our two non-smoking and connecting rooms were on the fifth floor. The furniture was not shabby as some of the reviewers had written. Room decor was smart and clean. Bathrooms were updated and quite nice. The only negative thing I can say is that the towels were not fluffy (smelled and felt more like those of a third or four star hotel than a 5 star establishment). Also, you can forget about the pool. It's really TINY and not very alluring!! The rooftop bar is however very nice for a drink before heading out into the Barcelona nightlife!! Third, Breakfast was included in our rate and was very decent. It was buffet style with a nice selection of breads, pastries, eggs, cold cuts, cheeses etc... Fourth, the restaurant recommendations provided by the concierge were fantastic. The bellman was extremely helpful and friendly. Would go back to this property again, mainly for its LOCATION, because it is clean and comfortable.

We chose this hotel based on it's 5 star rating and it's fabulous location. The hotel is located close to many tourist attractions, designer shops, and great restaurants. However, to echo many other travellers who have stayed at this hotel, IT IS DEFINITELY NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL by North American standards. Hotel rooms in Europe are know to be smaller than North American hotels, but when one pays $422 Canadian a night, one expects a lot. Unfortunately, our expectations were not met. What we paid for was the basic Classic room. Imagine what you'd have to pay to upgrade!!! Upon arrival the first night, we were shown to our room which barely held two twin beds pushed together to make a Queen, two end tables with lamps, a small desk (no dresser) and a small tv with only a few basic channels. There was barely enough room to walk around the bed, never mind space to put your suitcases. The attached marble bath was adequate but not 5 star material. It was equipped with a regular tub with rainshower showerhead, a very small wall enclosure but no shower curtain or glass door or wall. Inevitably, water would land on the marble floor making it slippery. The bathroom also contained a single marble sink, mirror and hair dryer - the toilet and bidet were in a small closet like area, separated from the rest of the bathroom by a sliding glass door. The view from the room was non-existent - it faced an exterior wall of another part of the building. When I complained that this room was not what I had asked for, I was promptly told that we had paid for a Classic (basic) room located at the back of the building and this room was an upgrade! Imagine what the Classic room must have been like! The room was also noisy. You could hear people walking and taking in the hallway, as well as the room above - not a restful place to sleep. The rooftop of the hotel held a bar where one could sit and have a drink as well as a small pool that was really too small for anyone to swim in...but the view was spectacular! A word of advice... if you are planning on staying at this hotel, don't eat or drink there. The hotel is located within walking distance of many wonderful restaurants that provide fabulous meals at a fraction of the cost that you would pay at the hotel.

I booked a standard room with breakfast. After reading reviews i was more than a little worried of what to expect from the Majestic especially after booking standard. All of this worry vanished when we arrived. The Majestic is positioned on Paseo de Gracia, the finest area to shop and dine out. The hotel is surrounded by Chanel, Louis Vuitton etc. On our arrival we were greeted by such a friendly team of staff and taken to our room. We had a lovely modern room with a great view of the city from the balcony. Also there were lovely decorations draping down the building with giant christmas baubles. The room was cleaned to perfect standards, and little touches to the room morning and night were very nice. From the rooftop there is a lovely view of the city, including most of Gaudi's work. It is in great walking distance to every attraction, the Segarda is just a block way and is a must see at night. Gauid's apartment is almost opposite the hotel. Breakfast was lovely, i was very pleased i booked this. I have stayed in Barcelona 3times before and never tasted a breakfast quite like this one. There was everything from full english to Champagne and strawberries. The service was fantastic. There was also a great atmosphere within the hotel at night, inc a nice piano bar.

We booked for 6 nights at 219 Euros per night. The room we were originally allocated was very small with limited facilities (no mini bar; CD player; DVD) and certainly not worth the money. There was an awful sewage smell along the corridor and in the room. We complained immediately. The manager was slow to respond at first but after we told the staff that we were thinking of moving to a different hotel they were, unsurprisingly, very helpful. We were moved to a bigger, more fragrant room, on the second floor which was much better and we were not charged any additional amount which was good. When my husband booked with the hotel he was advised that there was a CD player in each room. This is not correct. Howeevr, we were offered the loan of a CD player at a cost of 30 Euros per day - outrageous! The service generally was far below the standard I would expect of a 5 star hotel. We consider ourselves to be pretty laid back (especially on holiday) but we found that we were constantly having to chase reception/housekeeping as they were very slow in responding to our requests. It took three days to get an answer back about the CD player. The other thing we were disappointed by is that breakfast was not included in our room rate but quite frankly I would recommend going outside the hotel for breakfast as it was not worth the 25 Euros the hotel were charging for it. I have to say we were very pleased with the gym and the roof terrace and views over Barcelona are great and I imagine this would be fantastic in the summer. There is also a great spa - if a little costly. The location of the hotel is also good with great access to main sites, shopping areas and some excellent restaurants. We are accustomed to staying in smaller boutique hotels with excellent service levels (e.g. Ca Maria Adele (Venice); Carlisle Bay (Antigua); The W (New York); Hotel Du Vin (UK); Tokoriki (Fiji)) so this was very different experience for us. Some may like it - particularly the mature conservative crowd - but this not a hotel from the young (or, as in our case, the young at heart) for whom service levels are important. Not to mention contemporary styling (did I mention that the hotel is quite traditional).

We choused Majestic due it's location and since reviews were acceptable... we decided to try it. I'll try to be brief: - location: excellent on Passeig de Gracia, 10 minutes walk from Placa de Catalunya. - General: hotel looks like needs a little of refurbishing, small reception area, walls need in some area painting, etc. It's not terrible, but you can notice is not quite new. - Staff: friendly but let's say in some situations \"doing the extra mile\" is an unknown expression. Example: At 8 pm sharp (evan I was already sitting on a table for 10 minutes on the roof terrace waiting for someone to take my order), the waiter informed me that no orders can be made, program ends at 8. Although he prepares excellent mojito and sangria (we learned that previous evening, of course before 8 pm :)).

Upon check in we learned that hotel has 7 different type of rooms. We've got a small, dusty back yard room and we ask to change it if possible. First time was impossible, \"hotel is full\". Second time we've got to see 2 different rooms to choose from. We choused the one a bit larger (actually had the same area but different organized and had the feeling we have an extra space since there was no hall and from the door you were entering dirctly in the bedroom). After we moved in we discovered the room had a window but no view :)) I attached here 2 photos of our view! Rooms were clean but not spotless. They really need refurbishing (at least what we sow). Breakfast: excellent (various selection of cold and hot, fresh juice, etc). Loved it. Conclusions: because we decided to really enjoy our stay, we tried to make fun of the view, room, bathroom size (forgot to mention, really small) and not pay attention. Stil 250 euro/night in October is not quite a bergain. Please check exactly the type of room you are booking. From what I understood, rooms with balcony are superior, located on the main road/facade.

We informed reception who came and had a look at the exposed bolts but didn't actually offer to do anything about them. The hotel's roof top terrace is tiny and only has about 7 or 8 sun loungers so unless you are up there first thing in the morning you can forget about it. The final straw came when I requested an additional sun lounger for our private balcony (as there was only one on it). The girl at reception reluctantly agreed to check 'if it was possible' and said she would call me back to let me know. I sat waiting for 30 mins with no repsonse. At this stage I had had enough. So we packed our bags, checked out and went to another hotel. When we were checking out they did apologise and offered to upgrade us to a suite but by that stage I just wanted to get out of there.

The hotel was clean, quiet and had a relaxing atmosphere, which is appreciated after a days walking and sight seeing. Didn't use the pool because the weather was to cold.

Upon arrival, we were ignored as we repeatedly tried to get the receptionist's attention. When we were finally shown to our room on the seventh floor, it was dark, dingy, and slightly dirty in parts. The small window was directly opposite another room's window, which was a mere two metres away, and allowed minimal light through as our view was blocked by walls, drain pipes and gutters. The walls were extremely thin, meaning we could hear every noise the rather passionate couple next door to us were making. The toiletries brought my partner out in a rash, and the bathrobes were so coarse they aggravated my eczema. Our shower kept switching between scalding hot and freezing cold, and the lavatory kept blocking. We had requested a double room, but were met with two (fairly lumpy) single beds. We were told to merely 'push the beds together', and deal with it. Had I not paid over \u00a3200 a night, I probably wouldn't have minded so much, but as it was, it didn't seem appropriate 5 -Star behaviour.

We had booked for 3 nights but only stayed the one as it was so terrible. We booked through the Hotel Website and chose this particular hotel for many reasons, the main one being for the pool facilites. While travelling in the lift to our room we noticed a small typed up note advising that the pool and spa was closed for refurbishment. Not only did they not advise us of this when we checked in but more importantly, I felt so angry that there was/is no mention of this Refurbishment on their website. After complaining to reception, who were very cold and unsympathetic, gave us a couple of free passes for a pool 3 blocks away (hardly the same!). Our room was nothing like you would expect either from a 5* hotel, plus we had booked a superior room. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen. We chose to check out the following morning and find a hotel that met with our requirements and luckily we found Hotel 1898 which I must say, was a lovely hotel, and only 4 star, but in my opinion far superior to the Majestic. We felt we were then able to finally enjoy our break away. On returning home I wrote a letter to the GM as I feel very strongly that they should be advising all potential customers of the fact that their facilities are closed due to refurbishment, thus giving people the option especially as they pride themselves on their 'main priority being Customer Satisfaction'. I wanted answers as to why we were not advised in the first place, but he basically avoided all of my questions, so again, I wrote to him, only to receive another letter back stating that they are improving their facilities. I found the whole experience totally appalling, how we were treated beforehand, during and after our stay. I never normally complain, but on this occassion I felt i had too. its not about the money (although it did cost us around 240 euros for experience) but the fact that people like ourselves were able to book this hotel under false advertising.", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kyiv", "Title": "\u201cDear but rather good hotel\u201d", "Author": "Volodymyr", "ReviewID": "UR13798622", "Content": "Actually i was bit dissapointed by quality of extra bed and the fact that standard double room for it's price was too tight for 3 people.

Since i really needed a break alone, my husband offered me a weekend Barcelona to do some serious sightseeing (GHAUDI!!) and even more serious shopping! I chose the Majestic based on its location, and for the fact the manager of the hotel actually made the effort to read Tripadvisor and react to negative comments. I always read everything on tripadvisor before booking any hotel or holiday as i find it the best revieuw site worldwide. This is however my first written revieuw! I booked a single classic room. Basically I paid as much as a doubleroom would cost but i still expected to get the smallest room around really. NOT true. I got a nice room, quit spacious with a large bathroom (room 242). I originally was given another room but asked if i could smoke there and that was not the case so i was given another. I must say, walking thru the hallways and seeing other rooms being cleaned, that they seemed smaller. So yes, the rooms may not be big bit its a very old building, rooms differe in size and I did book the cheapest category. So if you take a classic room then indeed you have NO vieuw, and a smaller room. I had no vieuw indeed but i did not care and did not expect it. Its not like I'd go to barcelona to look out of the window all day, is it? Now for the Hotel. I loved it. Its peacefull, classy but very friendly. I never felt out of place there tho i strolled around in jeans and Tshirt basically and i clearly look like a tired mum and not like a potential Armani customer (Armani is next door). Everybody was friendly and willing to help or answer my questions. The Hotel is very clean, looks very wel maintained and is nicely decorated. The beds are comfortable, nice big towels, slippers, TV with several ebglish spoken channels etc. Only the bathrobes.....they are kidsizes. If you are over size 14, bring your own:P That goes for the whole of Barcelona tho, loads of shops but not a chance of buying any clothing over size M (14 or so). So I shopped a lot for my kids and saved my husband some money. Breakfast is standard buffet, not many fancy things but sufficient. The breakfast restaurant is maybe the nly area of ther hotel i did not like much, its in the basement and it does not have much atmosphere. It does the trick tho, you can sit comfortably and eat enuff to last till dinner. Negatives? Hotelwise i cant think of any that would not make me look utterly picky. Servicewise, only one thing botherred me. I do not use a creditcard. I dont have one, i hate them. I pay with my bankcard in Holland and cash elsewhere. My husband obviously has some but they are in his name so i dont take them. Even tho my hotel was payed for already they wanted my creditcard at check in. I said i didnot have one. I got the weirdest look ever, as if i am a total moron for not having one. Then I had to deposit 50 euros a night, apperantly to cover damage or costs i would cause or make before running of...or so.... I basically felt like a criminal and told the guy i didnot think it was nice to display so much distrust on a guest, who already payed for her whole stay. He just shrugged. I payed the 100 euros (2 nights). When I checked out 2 days later there was another receptionist. I asked for my money back and he asked for a receipt. I never got one when i checked in and told him that. He shaked his head, started looking in the computer for a while and eventually gave me the money back. Now that made me feel a bit weird, but other than that..i loved it there. If you have doubts, just book it, location is superb, service was great as well, apart from the little incident above.

Situated on the Passeig de Gracia it's ideally located for designer shopping while being just 25 minutes walk from the Old Town and 35 minutes from the Port. Many of the important sites are within striking distance, as are lots of restaurants and tapas bars. The hotel itself is a bit soulless, but the staff are very pleasant and extremely accommodating. We had a bit of trouble with the rooms; we'd booked a Privilege Room to ensure some private space and seating, but the two rooms we were offered were quite small and neither offered anything like the space or facilities shown on the hotel's website. On day 2 we asked to see some other rooms and chose a Superior Double which was far larger than the 2 Privilege Rooms (and of course cheaper too). The 2 Privilege Rooms had both had views over the main street, which was very pretty but really noisy - we moved to the Superior Room both for its extra space as well as peace and quiet; our view was of a car park at the back of the hotel but at least we got some sleep. Not all the superior rooms are as large - if you go ask for room 348 or indeed any room ending in ?48 - the first number denotes the floor you're on) - these are particuarly large and have a large bathroom with double was basins - another thing the Privilege Rooms didn't have. The breakfast in the lower ground restaurant was a self service and very average, but adequate. We didn't eat in the Michelin starred Drolma, preferring to eat in more Spanish restaurants. The Majestic's bar is OK - a bit busy and used as a lounge too (as there isn't an actual lounge area) so it lacked a bit of intimacy; but the service was good again. Would we stay again? Possibly if we couldn't find a better hotel with a good deal on, but the Majestic often does a 3 for 2 offer and that does give you value for money. Finally I must just add an excellent recommendation for a tapas bar just round the corner from the Majestic. Completely authentic and utterly delicious, it's the Cerveseria Catalana at 26 Carrer Mallorca. You'll have to queue and when you arrive give your name to the lady at the door who'll ensure you don't lose your place in the queue - the food is terrific, the staff helpful and English speaking and the experience is totally Spanish.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cAll style and no substance.\u201d", "Author": "sunneedays", "ReviewID": "UR11708789", "Content": "I stayed in the Majestic with my boyfriend in mid-December and the hotel is beautiful and very centrally located to the Passeg de Gracia metro stop.

The gentleman at the front desk was very kind and welcomed me. He said that our junior suite was not ready yet, however, for an additional 100 Euros per night, we could be upgraded to a large suite. I told him that unfortunately, I couldn't do that since my husband's company was picking up the tab. Then, he told me it was not a problem and he was going to do a complimentary upgrade so that I could go to the room. What a great way to start our experience at the Hotel Majestic. When the bellhop took me to the room I was SO happy with what I saw. It was very nice and luxurious (fresh floral arrangements in the living room adjacent to the bedroom, as well as in the master bathroom).

Our situation was a problem for them from the beginning. The issue---we were 3 adult travelers seeking 1 room. I contacted the hotel via e-mail to request our options. The only single room option was to book a junior suite, which was 400 euros per night plus 50 euros for the extra person. So that is what I booked. We stayed 3 nights. The problem was room service and housekeeping never got their act together and provided accommodations for 3 people. We had 2 of everything from drink glasses to bath towels to bath robes to sets of bed pillows. We kept asking for more supplies, including the shampoos and each time they would bring them but the next day it went back to 2 of everything. Finally I went down to the lobby and demanded management fix the problem. The lobby manager told me to return to my room and tell housekeeping what I wanted. I told him that he should deal with housekeeping, not me. I find this unbelievable in a 5 star hotel and told him that loud and clear. Other problems we encountered were the extra bed never had the same feather pillows the king bed had; other rooms had white bath robes and black pool robes--ours only had 2 white ones; the extra bed for the first 2 nights was actually just the sofa which they made up as a bed but there was no mattress pad, just a sheet over the sofa seat; the extra bed linens were only 2 sheets, no blanket was supplied and the pillow was a 12\" square throw pillow with a case on it; one day the sofa was made up as a bed all day long rather than making it up that way only in the evening so we had no place to watch TV or visit; every night only 2 of the 3 beds got turn down service. It was basically the poorest 5 star service I have ever received. There were some good things about this hotel. The location was perfect, right in the middle of things yet off The Ramblas, which all 3 of us preferred. The rooftop bar and swimming pool were both wonderful. Every night we went up to the roof for drinks and music, the view was a great end to a long day of trekking all over BCN. The breakfast was among the best we had anywhere in Spain. I realize we would not have had these problems if we were 2 to a room, but they did take our extra 50 euros and they did agree that 3 could be accommodated in 1 room so I fault the hotel entirely. The manager did give us an additional free standard room on our 3rd night, but I had to insist she do something more than her first offer which was a free breakfast on our last day. This negotiation took an hour, in the US it would have been a given. At no time did I get the impression that management would do almost anything to make it right--both managers I dealt with were really not interested in going above and beyond to assure our stay was a good one.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "rockland22", "ReviewID": "UR10006888", "Content": "hotel majestic was a great hotel , located right on passieg de gracia, everything was in walking distance. roof top pool offered some \"majestic\" views!!! the junior suites bathroom was amazing as well BIG shower and separate tub.", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cypress, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery good location, very comfortable hotel\u201d", "Author": "jbtexas", "ReviewID": "UR8852826", "Content": "The Majestic is a very comfortable, upscale hotel located in the center of Barcelona's shopping district on the Passeig de Gracia. As such, the location puts you right in the center of shopping action, a six block walk to Placa de Catalunya, two blocks from Gaudi's Casa Mila and two blocks from a metro station and Turistic bus stop (both north and south routes). This makes the location hard to beat, and is away from the noise of Las Ramblas (Rambla de Catalunya is a block away, but it is much quieter than Las Ramblas from Placa de Catalunya to the coast). If you want a hotel central to it all, but yet away from the tourist crowds of Las Ramblas or Barri Gotic, this hotel is hard to beat. We also found the hotel rooms quite comfortable and have absolutely no complaints about our four night stay there. We arrived at the hotel after our overnight flight from the US at 9:30 am and were able to get right into our room. I don't know if this is the norm, but we were sure pleased with this! Our room was #646, which was one price notch above a standard room. We found the room very comfortable with everything in good working order. Only two small minor observations about the room. If there was a clock, we could not find it. I realize that most European hotels don't have table top clocks a la American hotels, but for a hotel in this price range, I would have expected something. Also, there were no facial wash cloths. Again, very typical for Europe, but again at this price point, I was a bit disappointed. Our room was an interior room, so we had no view, but we also heard no outside noise. From the evacuation chart on the door of the room, it appears that rooms vary considerably in size. If you want a large room, I'd suggest calling the hotel direct to make a reservation. Further, if you look very closely at the hotel photos on the hotel web site, you will see that the floors are not level. You will climb up and down sets of steps as you go from one end of the floor to the other (there are two separate elevator banks - one on the Passeig de Gracia side, and one half way down the Valencia side). If you are staying at the hotel on a US dollar bankrolled vacation, you may wish to think twice about dining at the in-house acclaimed Drolma restaurant. Even without wine, your bill will approach or exceed $300. The food was fine, and the service attentive, if a bit rushed, but for $300, I would be hard pressed to say it was worth it. If your home currency is anything other than the US dollar, I'd recommend the restaurant. The hotel has a rooftop lounge / lap pool / deck area. There are much better places to get an elevated view of Barcelona (Castell Montjuic, Tibidabo, Parc Guell for starters), but it is a pleasant place to relax. If you want to save a few euros (and for US visitors, you'll need to!), rather than patronizing the hotel restaurant (Condial) for breakfast, you may want to consider Fresh & Ready, a small cafe a block and a half south on Passeig de Gracia. You can get cereal, fruit, pastries and coffee / tea and then sit out on sidewalk tables watching people go to work - not a bad way to start a vacation day! Fresh & Ready is open all day, and sitting at a sidewalk table with a sandwich / salad / beverage makes for some great people watching.", "Date": "September 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NEW YORK CITY", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Majestic\u201d", "Author": "LOVESVACATIONING", "ReviewID": "UR8716764", "Content": "Majestic certainly was majestic !!!

Our experience of the side entrance was not as bad as other reviews; we were greeted and checked in quickly, plenty of staff and everyone helpful. We asked about a different room and were offered one facing the main street; however it was a smoking room so stayed with our allocated classic room. After looking at the floor plan on the back of the door I think the room allocation is a bit of a lottery. We e-mailed the hotel and asked for a high floor as some reviews suggested they were bigger rooms. The design of the hotel means all rooms are different shapes and sizes, the more expensive rooms facing on to the main street are not always larger. We were lucky we had a good sized room and decent bathroom, although I can understand why some are not happy with room size. The building works started at 9am on week days, so hammering and drilling was constant, we found this frustrating as came away without our children and part of the appeal was some uninterrupted sleep and a lie-in bed in the morning! Breakfast on the Sunday was awful, the main restaurant was closed due to the decorating and breakfast was in a function room, which meant the cold food was warm and the warm food cold by the time we got to breakfast. They were also putting all the tables away around us which was frustrating as more guests arrived and they had to put some back up!!!!! The other 2 mornings were in the main restaurant which was a relief! We were disappointed about lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room and called reception to try to get some \u2013 funnily enough this was the only time no-one could understand English and all we could get out of 3 people was the offer of coffee as room service for 5Euros each!!!!

Arrived very early in AM on the 30th and was told the house was full and check in time was 3PM. So, we headed for roof top pool deck and hung out and dozed on chaise for a couple of hours. Around 10AM, we headed down thru lobby and discovered our room was ready. Having read the Trip Advisor warnings, we asked to see the room before taking our luggage up. It was 310, a twin bedded room in the back overlooking a parking lot and some air-conditioning unit. The front desk said it was a quiet room with lots of light. We demurred and insisted on a different room (and overheard others get upgrades at front desk) - and so we ended up in 729, with a balcony in front of hotel and a lovely view of Passeig de Gracia. Nice, light, quiet enough despite vehicle traffic outside. It was a somewhat painful time-consuming process to obtain an okay room. The room was smallish, bathroom functional but stonework in need of sprucing up. Mattress in need of replacement or rotation - I felt I would slide off the bed because the mattress leaned towards the telephone. Bedding okay - sheets decent enough quality. Plenty of pillows of different shapes and hardness. Message light on phone stayed lit for entire stay despite our numerous calls to front desk to address it. Housekeeping excellent. Hard finding any English speaking TV stations on the lovely flat screen TV. Turn down service nice touch. No noise from hallway. Elevators (all sets of them)- pathetically slow, at times, and small and hot. Hotel lobby and fancy restaurant undergoing some sort of renovation (someone said the air conditioning system was being fixed). Breakfast (included in price) was served in a conference room on lobby level our first 3 days and then in usual location (sub-basement level) last two days. Nice buffet selection...attentive service. No complaints. Free newspapers (some in English). The hotel has a decent gym area near the pool on roof as well as sauna and steam room. The sauna and steam can be used only upon payment of fee and with reservation. Plenty of chaises and chairs on roof, from which you can see Sagrada Familia Church, port, Montjuic- etc etc. Great views. The hotel is less than one block from Passeig de Gracia metro station which is very convenient to get down to Ramblas or to Barciloneta (sic) or anywhere. We took a Renfe train from that station to Sitges this past Sunday. Hotel is okay walk (slightly downhill) to Placa Catalon, but you'll will find the slight street grade incline makes the return walk a bit more grueling. Hotel was longer walk from Placa Catalon than we would have liked. Free ice and lemon and lime flavored water available 24/7 off lobby, along with red and green apples. Concierge extremely gracious and generous with time, advice, restaurant recommendations and reservations. Last night, we had ballet tickets at Liceu and had to depart hotel before Cafe d'Academia opened and could confirm. We headed for the popular restaurant after our show ended and, sure enough, hotel had come through with sought after reservation. Kudos to Concierge Christine and her \"colleagues.\" Despite its many features, I would be inclined to stay in a hotel in the Barri Gotic next time or, much more likely, the fabulous Hotel Arts right on the beachfront in Port Olympic, but a five minute walk from old city. We toured that hotel, and the rooms and views are impressive.

The entrance is on the side of the building and the lobby is very small. We booked a Classic Room which consisted of one room and a bathroom. The room was small with one bed that supposed to be queen size but it was full size. There were marks on the walls in some spots. The quality of the furniture was definitely not 5 star. The hotel splurged on a small flat screen tv for the room but there was no iron or an alarm clock! If we wanted to get up early we had to call the lobby every time. The bathroom was small but nice.

There are marks on the walls, the furniture upholstery is worn, and the overall qualilty is more of a 3.5 star hotel, as far as rooms are concerned.

We upgraded when we arrived to a more expensive room because the one we were put in was among the smallest in it's range, lower floor, and smelled of smoke. I'd hate to see what the base level room looked like. Also as might be typical of Europe, although I'm not sure, there is no iron supplied in the rooms. Maybe I'm just a spoiled America. Doesn't Motel 6 have irons? Indeed the location is excellent although noisy at times. The rooms are well sound proofed but that will only go so far when it comes to a horn happy culture. It is perhaps among the best locations in Barcelona as far as access, shopping and just plain action. As for the service it was OK but not great. Turn down service seemed to have vanished after the 2nd night. Oops they must have been listening, someone just showed up while I am writing this review. Now I won't have to call for towels. Also a call for a sewing kit the other night required a second call after it the first failed. A little nerve racking when your trying to make a dinner date. The roof deck offers a great view of the city with a small pool area, well equipped fitness room, and sauna. It can get busy. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to try the restaurant but heard it is among the best in the city, and as such is difficult to get into. The included breakfast buffet is excellent. Overall it is a decent hotel but does not overachieve, I would say it is average for the price. It seems higher end hotels just keep getting more and more expensive, but the service always seems to lag if not decline. The week dollar doesn't help the perception. I'm thankful for the relatively inexpensive wine and comparable food prices because a trip to Europe these days is not for the faint of heart when it comes to affordability.", "Date": "July 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oro Valley, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGreat location...but disappointed\u201d", "Author": "berniss", "ReviewID": "UR7986391", "Content": "We booked this hotel through our cruise line and felt comfortable that our 6 star cruise line would choose a very fine hotel for our stay. First the positive: the breakfast was excellent (one of the nicest we have ever had in Europe) and the location was very close to the information center, Ramblas, the tourist bus, and the Gaudi sites. We felt very safe walking in this area, even at night. We were to receive a prestige room and were expecting a room like the one pictured on the website. Instead, it was merely a classic room (the base room) with a balcony. The room and bathroom, while tastefully done, were quite small. Other cruisers, who stayed at various four star properties in Barcelona, and visited our room, said our room was not as nice as theirs and they paid considerably less. While the room wasn't miniscule, we paid for more, according to the picture, and expected more. Additionally, there was no concierge available and when we made restaurant reservations each night with the front desk , each night the reservations were wrong. The first night, the gentleman at the desk rang the restaurant we were told no reservations were needed and to go directly to the restaurant. THere was a long line and we had to wait for 40 minutes. The next night, even though we wrote out what we needed, the time of the reservation was wrong and we found out that they made the reservation an hour earlier than we requested. There was no confirmation as we are used to in a hotel of this class. Even room service was lacking, for two days they never emptied our waste paper basket. Lastly, porterage was supposed to be included in our package, yet our porter, who was very nice, told us he was not informed of this and wanted his tip. It was very embarrassing.

Two issues with my stay - first, the floral arrangments that were displayed throughout the hotel in the first few days of my stay were made with strong scent of lilies. Some people might be allergic to that - I personally had to cover my nose when walking in. A more thoughtful selection on the flowers might be a good idea since guests travel from all over the world and allergy is quite common in some countries. Second, we brought a periodical on the plane to read and put it in the bathroom when we got to the hotel - it's a weekly paper that my husband had collected over 15 years, not one single issue was missing. Two days before we checked out, we found that a corner of it was torned. We thought it was just an accident by the maid. Then the day before we checked out, we found it missing.

This was my second visit to Barcelona - for the first I stayed in the Eurostars Grand Marina, but fancied something a little more central \u2013 I was not disappointed. I chose the Grand Marina because of its close proximity to the port as I was taking a cruise, however for strolling around the city it is a bit out of the way. A taxi from the airport will cost between 20-30 Euro. Pros Location, Location, Location \u2013 The Majestic is only five minutes stroll from Barcelona\u2019s main square (Placa de Catalunya) from where you can begin to walk the Ramblas. There are two convenient Tourist Bus (19Euro for 1 day or 23Euro for Two) stops close to the hotel and this really is the best way to get around the city. Quality of Furnishings \u2013 The room was beautifully appointed and spotlessly clean. The corridors and lifts are also fresh and airy. Quality of Service \u2013 Staff were able to cope with any queries I had and I certainly never felt that they were straining to understand English. The staff serving Breakfast also have good English. The breakfast is good, well laid out and tasty \u2013 complimentary newspapers are also provided at breakfast. (Main UK newspapers are also readily available from the small newsagents situated along the main avenue). Proximity of Dining Locations \u2013 in Barcelona you cannot help but partake of Tapas. There are plenty of small to medium sized Tapas bars located within easy walking distance of the hotel (along the Paseo de Gracia). I would recommend Caf\u00e9 Gollege (or Moulins) and Qu Qu for excellent food and service (both also have menus in English). The Majestic has two restaurants, but I did not try either of them. Cons There are very few Cons with the Hotel Majestic. But, in the interests of balance I will provide a few that I noticed: The air conditioning was not switched on in the hotel until our third night. I did ask reception on the first night when I found it didn\u2019t work in our room but was told that they do not switch it on in winter. Coming from the UK we wouldn\u2019t class 22\u00b0 as winter! Hot plates are not provided for the breakfast buffet \u2013 heated food gets cool very quickly when placed on a cold plate! Enough with the negativity! This is neither a pro nor a con but if you prefer a near-silent night\u2019s sleep (as I do) I would recommend taking one of the rear facing rooms in the hotel. The Paseo de Gracia is a beautiful tree lined avenue, but carries a heavy volume of traffic and I would imagine a room looking directly onto the front to be noisy. If you are thinking of holidaying in Barcelona and want a 5 Star, central location within easy walking distance of all amenities and the excellent Tourist Bus system \u2013 then choose the Hotel Majestic.", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Linlithgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIt is exactly as it says on the tin, MAJESTIC!\u201d", "Author": "ckennedy7", "ReviewID": "UR6812990", "Content": "Arrived at hotel at night, and were greeted by reception staff and porters who were english speaking and took our bags up to our room.

This is a large boulevard filled with designer shops and restaurants as well as Gaudi architecture and frequent stops for the tourist bus. The room was nice and the bathroom large. I had upgraded to a Superior room but like other reviewers on the site I was not sure what more I got for my money. However I liked the room and we were at the end of the hall and on a quiet street. The room had all the normal amenities that you would expect of a good hotel, toiletries, bathrobe, slippers etc. \u2013 plus a comfortable bed. The TV had a good selection of satellite channels including BBC which is unusual for European cities, we usually only get the English news channels. We did not use the gym, room service or eat at any of the restaurants but we did use the pool on the rooftop. This was a great place although a bit crowded during the late afternoon when everybody wanted to get some late sun and have a quick dip. But that was ok because I knew it would be like that and prepared myself for it. I was just pleased that it had a pool as they are hard to find in city hotels. The pool area however came into its own in the evening.

The rooftop pool is small, more of a plunge pool than anything to swim in, but perfect to cool down in.

We had a 5:40 PM flight that arrived in Barcelona at 7:45 AM on Friday. Although JFK was a little disorganized, Delta was just great. The flight was smooth as can be. When we arrived at BCN (Barcelona airport) we waited on a very short line (maybe five minutes) to pass through customs and immigration. Our bags were waiting on the carousel and we grabbed a luggage cart (there are no sky caps at the Barcelona airport and the luggage carts are free to use, just walk to the side of the carousel and grab one) and proceeded to the taxi stand. There was a long line of taxis waiting. We knew from these boards that the fare for the cab to the Majestic Hotel should have been around 25 Euros and it was exactly that price. We arrived at the Majestic about 9:00 AM. Great Hotel. As this was our first time in Europe we had nothing to compare it to, but we have stayed in the Plaza Hotel (not so great) the Waldorf Astoria (very nice) The United Nation Plaza (very nice) in New York, The Fairmont in San Francisco (best bed we ever slept in) as well The Princess in Acapulco (beautiful grounds) so even though we\u2019ve never been to Europe we\u2019ve been to a couple of nice hotels and the Majestic was certainly nice. We had room #701, a junior suite overlooking the Passeig De Gracia, the hotel is situated between two Gaudi buildings, the Batllo and La Pedrera. The hotel is just a few blocks from the top of Las Ramblas (there are definitely hotels a lot closer to Las Ramblas) and is on both the RED and BLUE line of Bus Turistic. The staff and concierge at the hotel were excellent. Everyone speaks English, the hotel was immaculate, the staff very friendly, and the room huge. We freshened up and hit the streets. When my DW and I talked about jet lag with our friends, everyone advised us \u201cnot to go to sleep\u201d so we didn\u2019t. Even though we hadn\u2019t slept the entire evening (save for a few winks on the plane) we forged ahead and went for a walk and breakfast on the Passeig De Gracia. After a nice omelet at an outdoor caf\u00e9 we bought tickets for the Bus Turistic and made the Sagrada Familia our first stop. The church is quite impressive from the outside so we decided to go inside as well. The line in front of the bus stop was huge so my DW and I figured that we would just walk around the church, see the whole thing take a few pictures and get back on the bus. As we circled the block we found another ticket window around the corner that had absolutely no line, so we bought tickets and went inside. There is an elevator that goes to the top, but the line was very long and we didn\u2019t want to wait. We asked if there were stairs but we were told that there weren\u2019t, so we just walked around for a little bit and left. My DW then walked through the small, limited gift shop but didn\u2019t get anything. Across the street from the church was a great gift shop that had some really beautiful things. We went to a local supermarket in the neighborhood, walked around a little bit and then got back on the bus and made the Parc Guell our next stop. The bus stops on at the bottom of the hill several blocks from the parc. It is a long uphill climb on a very narrow street to get up to Parc Guell. It was very hot (the middle of the afternoon in the middle of July) but the views from the Parc were well worth it. The parc has a beautiful entrance (mosaic dragons and lizards line the steps) and the columns, corridors, open spaces and buildings are really incredible. The panorama overlooks all of Barcelona. Just an incredible view. There is a small snack stand with shaded umbrellas at the top where we enjoyed some ices. We then took the outside path of the parc down to the main street, which led us back down the hill to the bus stop. By now it was about 4:30 or 5:00 PM. We took the bus back to the Hotel Majestic (seeing quite a bit of the city along the way) and took a short nap and got ready for dinner at 9:00. The concierge recommended a restaurant called Botafumiero. It is a seafood restaurant that had great fish and Paella. With wine and tip, dinner for 2 was 100 Euros. Certainly not cheap, but we loved it. When we arrived at the restaurant at 9:00 PM we were one of the only diners in the restaurant. When we left at about 11:30 the place was packed. We took a cab back to the hotel to get ready for tomorrow. We woke up Saturday morning and my wife asked me to look at her watch to see what time it was. I asked her if she had changed her watch to Barcelona time. She said she had, and I said \u201cwell, then it\u2019s 12:15 PM. She made some comment about my age and my ability to see small numbers so I checked her cell phone and sure enough, it was 12:15. We felt great but we had slept for about 11 hours. We thought it was a small concession to the travel and the time change, went down to the internet caf\u00e9 at the hotel (20 Euros for the duration of your stay), did our business and then I went out to get us some coffee and rolls. We are both big coffee drinkers so we didn\u2019t mind the espresso that they serve in Spain. Got dressed and then took a cab down to the Plaza Catalunya, so that we could walk down Las Ramblas. After a few blocks of the human statues, the bird salesman and postcard kiosks, we took a left hand turn and entered the Barri Gotic (the Gothic Quarter). We found ourselves in front of a beautiful church and sat down at a caf\u00e9 (Estruch) for pizza and salad. The plaza was a beautiful place to have lunch and watch the action. After lunch we began our search for the Picasso Museum. We only had the map from the Bus turistic (and because the museum is not one of their stops, it\u2019s not on the map) so we really weren\u2019t sure where it was. We saw some signs pointing in the general direction of the museum and we gladly followed. The time that we spent lost (there is no other word for it. We didn\u2019t know where we were or where we were going) in the Barri Gotic was magical. We loved it. We found wine shops (you can bring wine on the ship, but I\u2019ll talk about that later), alleyways, incredible architecture, friendly people and eventually the Picasso Museum. The line was about 25 minutes and the entrance fee about 8 or 10 Euros. My wife loved the museum and all of Picasso\u2019s works. I\u2019m not as sophisticated as she is, so she tolerated my opinions for the 45 minutes we toured the museum. After we left we walked toward Port Vell. It was a pretty good walk to the port, but we were there to see Barcelona so we didn\u2019t mind. The port is fantastic. I\u2019m not sure which part was old and which parts were built for the 1992 Olympics, but the cool breeze, open space and views of the Marina were beautiful. We walked all the way down (and it was a pretty long walk) to the bus stop for the Bus Turistic. By now it was 8:00 PM (although it seemed like the middle of the day) so we took the bus back to the Batllo (the stop closest to our hotel) and got ready for dinner. We wanted to visit an acquaintance in Barcelona so we asked the concierge to change our dinner reservation at Aqua to 10:30 PM. By the time we finished our visit and got down to Agua (a great restaurant on the beach) it was after 11:00 PM. The hostess wasn\u2019t too happy that we were so late for our reservation so she made us wait till 11:30 for our table. We sat at the table closest to the Mediterranean and settled in. By the time our food came it was midnight and the restaurant was still packed. I guess it\u2019s true\u2026they have dinner at midnight in Barcelona. Food was very good (service just OK). Wife had fish, I had chicken. With wine and tip, about 65 Euros. Grabbed a cab back to the hotel about 1:30 AM to get ready to board the Jewel in the morning. I guess that since we were doing a pre-cruise, we should have packed our luggage with that in mind. I would definitely recommend packing a bag for your pre-cruise and then packing bags for your cruise. We spent a lot of time on Sunday morning having to repack all of our luggage. On Sunday morning, again, I went down to the Fresh and Ready (that was the name) to get coffee and croissants. After breakfast and packing we left our bags with the hotel to do a little last minute sightseeing. We stopped in the Casa Batllo (a famous Gaudi building on the Passeig De Gracia) for only a moment. From the brief glimpse we had it was great. We bought a few souvenirs, took a stroll around the neighborhood (everything was closed on Sunday morning. The streets were deserted) and then went back to the hotel We didn't eat at the hotel nor did we order room service. The staff was incredible. Very friendly. Very Helpful. Always interested. Never seemed like they were too good to help us. Rooftop pool area is really cool. Great views of the city. Nice gym. The Hotel was immaculate. Bed was tremendous. There is a 3 for 2 night special so make sure you take advantage of it. Three nights at the hotel were 800 Euros. Location was incredible. Nicest section of city.

We found the city of Barcelona to smell (sewerage) almost every other block. The city is not a clean city. It has a kind of dog eared quality to it that must have shined brightly at one point but is definitely over the hill now. Whole city needs housekeeping. Ramblas et al is ok, but same commercial greenway situation is found in a number of cities. Streets, walks chronically crowded. Signage is desparately unhelpful and I can't think of any attraction that does not have a superior conterpart in other cities and locations (beach, mouuntain park, cathedrals, winding \"old town\" alleyways, as charming as can be, full of folks wishing to sell you something). We caught some ladies in process of lifting our wallets in street. But this can happen anywhere. Nice town, but not unique.

I would say that the hotel is very average in every way. It is an old hotel, hence you cannot expect huge functional rooms. Their website tells you classic rooms are 20 sq metres...they do not hide the fact that their classic rooms are tiny, however, images on their website are not representative of the actual rooms, for instance, the bathroom in the image under classic room is not the bathroom you will receive; the bathroom will actually be very small and will require the agility of a gymnast to navigate. When I brought this up, the point was ignored. Wireless internet was also advertised.....could I get reception? Only by holding my laptop in the air at a strange angle, in a strange position! For a 5 star hotel, the bar is reasonably priced. The food may perhaps be decent....they will tell you that Drolma has a Michelin star, however, when hot food is served very cold after a very long wait, it is difficult to ascertain quality (and no apologies made either). 5 star? Well, yes and no. In Spain, stars are awarded convincingly on facilities, not quality. I have not often experienced such average 5 star facilities with tacky unimaginative decor, but they do what they do and they do it well enough to run a \u2018successful\u2019 hotel. Having had a look at the better rooms, I would suggest only staying here if you were prepared to pay the extra for an upgraded room. I would suggest staying elsewhere rather than a classic room unless you are supremely interested in location and you are not bothered by impolite staff and ineffective service, though the classic rooms are very cheap, so this may sway you. If you want good service and a good all round experience, stay elsewhere. I would perhaps make some suggestions to the hotel, however, I have read some of the responses made to other reviewers on this website, and I find these to be rude, unhelpful and argumentative.... similar to the attitude when face to face with the front desk staff. I would rather just move on to a different hotel than waste any more time with this hotel.

The reason for booking it was the exceptional location: close to everything within walking distance there is no better choice under that point of view. But apart from that I think that there is no reason to stay there. My wife arrived a day before me, being a young, single travelling women. Was it a coincidence that she was given the room next to the elevator, courtyard facing with a very strange, convoluted layout with a small window in the corner between the bathroom and the wall, so it was like a room without a window? Of course somebody has to take the bad rooms, but why allocate it to somebody who has booked for 5 days and not to somebody who just spends there one night? So we were given another room. As we opened the door, a wave of very bad, acidic smell came out. We called the front desk and the person who came round wrinkled his nose and admitted, that there was a terrible smell, assuming that it was the new carpet of the remodelled room. Well, if their new carpets smell like this, I dont want to know about the old ones \u2026 Room number three, not expecting much anymore, was very small too. Between the bed and the bathroom there was the desk with a minibar, a small table with two chairs and the closet with a rack for a small suitcase. Furnished like this, there was no space for putting a regular suitcase on the floor leaving space for walking around it so that we either had to close it and put it uprigth or climb over it when we wanted to go to the bathroom. Truly exciting when you have to get up at night. Now we definitiely were ready for a drink. But the minibar/refrigerator was not working. As we do not like warm drinks we called for ice cubes (no ice-machines in the corridor) and maintenance. The electrician arrived before the waiter and fixed it. Than the ice-bucket came and we were informed, that we had to pay 5 Euros for it. For a bucket we needed, because the fridge was broken and the drinks were too warm? In a 5 star property? Come on, that\u2019s realy bad style and cheesy. Beeing very small, the air in the room was sticky. Usually we like to leave the windows open. But in this case we preferred not to, because the fire stairs were crossing the window. So we switched on the A/C. There was air coming out of the outlet but it was warm. We put the thermostat to the minimum, but still only warm air. We asked several times for reparation at the front desk, but nothing happened. Why not offer to have another room with a working A/C? The best thing about the room was the housekeeping. Very efficient and immaculatly clean all the time. The toilet was tucked between the washbasin and the wall so that one had to squeeze himself diagonally on it. The lobby, bar and restaurant were very stylish and arranged tastefully. The breakfast room is located in the basement (no windows). The food-quality was very good and the service very efficient. On our visits the breakfast room was crowded and the acoustics were quiet bad so that the overall experience was not very pleasant. The female front-desk staff were very nice and helpful, whereas male stuff were rather presumptuos. Example? We were asking for directions one morning, when suddenly the employee turned away from us starting a conversation with somebody more interesting than us. Probably the stay would have been better, if we had booked a de luxe room (130 Euros more per night). But how could we know before? When booking in a 5-Star property one can expect a certain size and standard even in the least expensive room. But the \u201eclassic\u201c rooms in my opinion are definitely substandard in terms of size, layout and location. Of course in the hotels website it\u2019s noticed that they are only \u201eapproximately 20 square meters\u201c (they should add, that they are dark and the samll window only gives a view in a grim courtyard) what would be barely acceptable if of regluar shape. But in such a tubular or strange layout, it's much worse and clearly not acceptable. In my opinion, the very narrow rooms I have seen, should only be furnished with a small bed and sold as single rooms only, as for two persons they defintively are unreasonable in a 5-Star property.

For a pleasant walk, Las Ramblas is only a block away, and it conveniently slants toward to sea coaxing one\u2019s stride along a street of sumptuous sights and experiences. Street entertainers, outdoor cafes, architecture and people elevate the soul. Barcelona is a place not only to observe art, but to experience it. From the time you get up in the morning until the wee hours of the night, the city rewards those who subscribe to whole-hearted living. Enjoy it all. And know that when your body tires long before your spirit, that your room at the Majestic awaits you. Your bed will be turned down - its arms open wide. Your pillow will cradle you, your blanket embrace you. By morning you will be restored. And if you are lucky enough to have an extended stay, you can enjoy another day and night of extending the best of time.

I've stayed in a few 5 star hotels including New York and London but none beat the Majestic. It was a special birthday for my fiance and we had booked a superior room but we were upgraded to a junior suite on arrival. The room was absolutely fantastic, a huge room with a sperate seatng area and a large bathroom including a walk in shower and jacuzzi bath. The room was at the front of the hotel and there were two sets of double doors with two small balconies overlooking the passeig de gracia, the view was incredible. A bottle of cava and fruit were delivered to us on arrival which was such a nice touch. Everything about the hotel was luxurious and elegant and the staff were so helpful, they couldn't do enough for us. The hotel is in an excellent location, walking distance away from all the major sights and right in the middle of the action. The tourist bus stop is just across the road and is the best way to do your sightseeing. We didn't visit the Drolma restaurant but it looks really nice, we did visit the other restaurant downstairs in the hotel for our evening meal one night and the food was lovely. Breakfast is held in this restaurant each morning aswell and is brilliant and well worth the 20 euros which I have heard some people on trip advisor complain about, there is so much choice and something for everyone even my fiance who is a fussy eater enjoyed it. The bar is really nice and the cocktails are delicious! We loved to relax in there after a busy day. The 10th floor is the rooftop pool area and has a breathtaking panoramic view of the city. We went up there on our last night before our evening meal and sat and watched the city lit up at night. I'm sure there's more things I've forgotten to mention but all in all we had such a happy and memorable stay, I would definately recommend the Hotel Majestic to anyone and we can't wait to visit again.", "Date": "November 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Hotel in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4014575", "Content": "I last stayed in this hotel over 40 years go and have longed to go back and my husband and I finally made it this year.

Here are my views. First the good points. The hotel is in a great location. Near a Metro stop and underground rail station. Very safe location. Great shops nearby and stunning architecture. Turistic bus stops outside. When we arrived I was impressed with the professionalism of the desk staff. I had booked the Discovery pack which included a Classic room, breakfast and tickets for the turistic bus for not much more than room only price. They had my pack ready when I arrived and also upgraded my room to one with a side street view, a nice touch. The room was immaculate and the hotel as a whole was very peaceful. Things I didn\u2019t like. I would consider the room small. The easy chairs for example were not very comfortable, so you would not be spending time lounging in the room. This was fine as the city is great and you are out all the time. My big disappointment was the bar. It\u2019s tucked at the back of the lobby with no windows. The prices for drinks there are over the top. About $16 for a Bacardi and Coke! Therefore we drank there once only and learnt our lesson. Drinks are a third of the price at a next door cafe and you can also watch the passing show. Breakfast is no great shakes. Poor choice and lukewarm coffee. The lobby is boring. I like to sit and watch people come and go. The lobby area is small and you can\u2019t really sit about. The roof was nice but small so sun loungers were taken all day. Its also very hot up there and no shade. Overall, although above average,I found the hotel very expensive for what it offered.

The M is not where you would typically choose to stay for a stag weekend - it is a plush 5 star relaxed and quiet hotel and we were a respectful lot, all in our late 30's and early 40's. it is ideal for couples who want a quiet romantic time just as it is ideal for leisure and business groups 2. Staff were all friendly and helpful - much more so than many other 5 star hotels, ordering us cabs willingly, advising us of good night spots and cultural tours and giving us prompt and friendly roof top and room service 3. The rooftop pool is a perfect place to unwind, regroup, re-energise, get some sun, take a dip, order an ice cool drink or a tasty snack, all with a beautiful view of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia a couple of blocks away and right in the heart of the Paseo de Gracia (the most majestic of Barcelona avenues), the posh shopping district and a hop, skip & a jump from the Ramblas 4. \"Superior\" rooms have lovely views of the City, and you can block out all the noise with their double doors or open them wide to let the sunshine and Barcelona atmosphere in to your room. The Privilege rooms are even nicer with balconies. 5. The friendly front desk man, Tim, ordered us a comfortable and air conditioned coach service at a very reasonable price from and to Barcelona International airport - about a 35 min journey each way 6. All my correspondence with The Majestic booking staff (Natacha in particular, and Bruno) was carried out promptly and in a very friendly business-like manner - very helpful and patient staff 10 out of 10 and quite a few of us will definitely be using The Majestic again, next time with our loved ones, and in my case, with my loved one, my wife to be.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "rotherham south yorks", "Title": "\u201cexcellent location\u201d", "Author": "art3007", "ReviewID": "UR3890303", "Content": "We stayed at the Majestic on a three for two offer in a double room.(5th 8th sep 2005) i was anxious initially as i had read that these rooms were small.

I am sorry to say we were deeply disappointed. Room 822. I write this, so as to give other potential clients of the hotel fair warning. Firstly the Good: Location is fantastic, on the Passeig de Gracia an easy walk to the Rambla and a block from the Metro station. The reception and entrance is grand; flowers, marble, efficient staff The porter service, very sharp and friendly. The Bad: I think this may all have been the unfortunate (intentional or not) allocation of a terrible room. - The room was tiny, even by European standards (We have traveled a lot). The small table and chair infringed on the cupboard, so if one wanted to access the cupboard, you had to move the furniture. - The bathroom was even smaller, my wife and I could not be in this room together. The toilet is right next to the bath/shower, so getting out the shower was a challenge, and some dexterity was required to stand in the available space. Also mildew abounded in the shower - The bed creaked and squeaked. This was partially corrected by housekeeping. - Our room on the 8th floor was underneath the top floor restaurant, so every night at midnight the sound of dragging furniture woke us up. Calling the reception to complain got a quizzical response and the promise to send someone up to investigate \u2013 I never received a response to this. - The air-conditioning system is archaic. Every time the thermostat kicked in, the air turned on loudly, and when cool, turned off, loudly again, keeping up awake. - Upon checkout, they were very efficient at billing us, but not once were we asked about our stay. I did complete a survey, and wonder if anyone will see this? So in general, it was a disaster. This is certainly NOT a 5 star hotel. The glossy exterior belies what is inside.

We had wonderful stores and small restaurants and tapas bars in all directions. We stayed in a junior suite, which was extremely comfortable. The seating area had plush chairs and a sofa, which enabled us to relax after sightseeing. Although we were on the second floor overlooking the Passeig de Gracia, the room was quiet. From our windows we could look across the street at some of the area's beautiful Modernista buildings. The breakfast buffet in a window-less but comfortable lower level was sumptous and got us started for the day. There were such typical Spanish dishes as Serrano ham and tortillas (made with potatoes). There were many kinds of pastries. I even had a fried egg because of the gorgeous organge yolks. Then I added a small baked potato half (topped with olive oil), something I have never had for breakfast. Once we stopped in the lobby lounge for coffee and another time for a light supper. We didn't get to try the expensive and very elegant restaurant Drolma. Access to a computer in the business center really worked for me.

Our friends were staying in the Claris (1 block away) and even though they had \"the nicest room\" there, it was dark and smaller and the rooftop did not have near as nice a view (although their restaurant on top had great - but pricey - food) Room service was always pleasant - they sent someone to fix our t.v. at 1am! And the location could not have been beaten. Overall a great experience. As an aside, after the first 2 days there was banging in the room above us. We complained and the manager moved us to another Jr. Suite, this time on the 6th floor - room 611. The balconies were not as nice but the room was the same. Right after we moved, there was banging from the other side of the building. We called the manager back and he put us in a large suite which was VERY nice.

After complaining we got a upgrade to a premier room (712) , not nearby 5 star hotel quality at several hotels I have visited before. The facts: Price: We paid about 400 Euro for a small, stinky room, with a small bathroom. Poor quality furniture, but it had a good view from the balcony. A lot of traffic noise from 0530 in the morning. We had to have the window open since the smell from the air condition system was really terrible. Since the hotel was prepaid they even refused to let us get anything back if we moved from the hotel after check-in, even if we complained promtly. We asked for a refound for at least 1 night, but the refused even this. Faced with a bill at about 1200 Euro for three nights, we felt like we had to stay there.

We booked through Lastminute (efficient) and paid approximately 1,000 Euros for the three nights (breakfast not included - see below) for a superior room. The location, on the Paseo de Gracia, is superb, especially as we were doing the \"tourist bit\" - it is close to many sites, and to the metro and the Barcelona tour bus stops. After that, with the notable exception of the front-desk staff, who were extremely helpful, everything was downhill .......... The problems centred around the room itself, and the (in) competency of the staff and their (poor) attitude. I don't think we've ever paid so much for such a small, poorly equipped room. We had requested a King bed - we got two singles pushed together. The windows are tiny, and the bathroom not much bigger. Room cleaning was perfunctory at best. However, the biggest issue with the room was (lack of) air-conditioning. During our stay in Barcelona, it was relatively warm, exacerbated by the heating in the room being on full when we arrived. We turned this off but, during the whole of our stay, we could never get the room cool enough to sleep in comfortably. When we complained, we were told that the air-conditioning was turned off in the winter in favour of heating, and nothing could be done (remember, this is a 5* hotel). Opening the window was no good - not only was it too small to make much difference, the hotel's location meant that there was always traffic noise. We could just about have lived with the room, had the service been great .......... Four examples - - on our first night, we had booked a restaurant outside the hotel. We asked the concierge to hail us a taxi, which he did. We inadvertently forgot to tip him so, on our return, my wife specifically sought him out and did tip him, with apologies. Yet the next three times we asked the concierge staff to hail a taxi, they clearly and deliberately ignored us, such that we had to do it ourselves, - the bar staff in the main bar on the ground floor seemed obsessed by tips. Having had poor service the first night (waiting 25 minutes for a simple order of drinks), we did not tip the waiter - on succeeding nights, we simply could not get the waiters to pay any attention to us - as I said earlier, breakfast is not included. We tried the breakfast buffet in the basement (no windows). Everything about breakfast was chaotic and disorganised - it took several minues to get seated, and then an eternity to get the tea we had ordered which, when it arrived, was lukewarm. Hoping for better things with room service the next day, we were sorely disappointed - wrong order, food that was barely warm, and this time the tea was almost cold!! At over 20 euros, the cost for waht you get is exorbitant. - last straw - on departure, we had an early morning flight to catch at Barcelona airport, travelling through the rush hour. Fifteen minutes after requesting a porter, no-one had appeared, so I called again - a further ten minutes elapsed with no show. My wife and I gathered up our luggage, and headed downstairs. When we hit the lobby, I'm sure you can guess by now what happened ..... three porters, no less, wishing to help us to a taxi, and \"earn\" the magic tip - we declined despite their evident disapproval. My summary - despite its wonderful location, the facilities of this hotel represent vary poor value for money (suggest you try the Hotel des Arts) - by no stretch of the imagination do they equate to five star. This is exacerbated by the approach and attitude of the staff - with the notable exception of the front desk, they seem driven by one motive - a tip. I could and would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

On arrival we found out that because of the length of our stay, we had been upgraded to a \"superior\" room at no extra cost. Although this seemed like a nice gesture, we found the room to be very dissapointing and of a lower standard than we would have expected from the \"basic\" room we had paid for. It was very small, and not very well equiped considering that it was in a 5* hotel - there wasn't even a trouser press! The biggest disappointment with our room was the poor and erratic nature of the maid service. Some days our room wasn't cleaned at all, other days it was half cleaned, on two occasions the cleaner took all the towels but didn't replace them, and although after I complained at the front desk, towels were sent up and reassurances given that it wouldn't happen again, the following day the cleaner took all the pillow cases and didn't replace them! The bathroom wasn't cleaned properly during our entire stay - the sticky label from a previous guests shampoo bottle was stuck to the outside of the bath when we arrived, and it was still there when we left! As we suspected that the bathroom wasn't being cleaned other than around the sink, we deliberately placed small lengths of cotton thread on the toilet and bidet to see if they got cleaned off - they didn't!! Another negative point was the roof terrace - although it had good views, the swimming pool up there was tiny and should really be described as a dip pool instead. The roof top bar closed very early as well, which was a shame as it would have been nice to sit up there in the evenings. The hotel piano bar, on the other hand, was certainly a plus point - very friendly and attentive staff, together with a nice ambience.
