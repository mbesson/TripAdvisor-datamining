Breakfast was provided each morning; it was plentiful and varied with cereals, scrambled eggs and pastries as well as the more traditional European breakfast fare of meats, breads and cheeses. Coffee, made to order, was available as well as a variety of juices and fruit. While Hotel Santa Maria does not serve meals other than breakfast and a snack in the afternoon, a wealth of restaurants is available outside the gates of the hotel. The Trastevere neighborhood, where the hotel is located, has a well-deserved reputation as the place where locals come to dine. We ate each evening in Trastevere and were not disappointed. The hotel is located \"across the river\" from the major sites but everything is easily accessible by public transportation (taxi, bus, metro) or by walking. We walked everywhere. It was lovely to come back to our neighborhood each evening and escape the hustle and bustle of central Rome . The neighborhood is a very old one comprised of small, twisting streets; great for strolling about before or after dinner. It is a bit gritty in spots but that is part of its charm because it is a real neighborhood and feels like one.

Trastevere itself is on the far side of the river for most of the 'sights' and while most these can be walked to over the course of a week-end visit its still a bit of a trek especially on the uncompromising Roman cobbles and in the heat. Also the area is quite run down more noticeably so during the day, shuttered doors, graffiti and rubbish strewn streets; At night I will say the place takes on a different atmosphere with every shuttered establishment turning into either a bar or bistro.

Hotel (separate rooms with verandah/suites some with upstairs second room, central small garden to sit) is well located and it is super safe to walk around at night locally (OK , this hotel is not near the grotty area of the main train station thank god- but it is only 7-10 euros by taxi away) . There are parts of rome you dont walk through at night (hey it is a big city like any other) , so be careful if you are sightseeing at night on foot. Getting around- I have a disability & managed to walk to half the sights, caught the GREEN/GOLD hop on/off bus which runs nearby for some farther sights, and when we ended up at the opposite side of the city at Villa Borgheses after a big day out walking (fantastic parklands this place is a must when you get overloaded with culture), the taxi back was only 15 euros well worth it. We will definitely go back to Hotel sante maria- it is not the cheapest hotel, but definitely worth paying the extra. The 3D cinema place with the history of Rome sounds daggy, but definitely worth seeing, at the beginning of your holiday to make sense of the historical significance and timeline of the sights you will be visiting. Even if you want to visit the vatican independently, I cant emphasise how so much easier and quicker it was to book a date and tour with the offical vatican website before you go. They just slot you into one of the local tour people and you join up with a few groups, but the actual guide we had was an artist who gave a fantastic tour of the main areas without any religion and at the end we were left to explore further as you wished. Get up early in morning and visit nearby Piazza Camp De Fiore markets, Piazza Navona is nearby, empty in the morning, street performers during the day busy with tourists, expensive cafes for food, but is cheap to sit and have a local beer and people watch and take in the atmosphere, artists come out at night. Also good ATMs and bank in Navona Piazza. When out ask for local beer or wine at any cafe or bar as it is cheap and quite quaffable, and you are always served a small bowl of chips, olives and nuts (enough to get you by). If you are considering going to Pompei or Sorrento, do it as a separate trip from Rome as it is too far out. We did a weekend stopover via train to Sorrento to see these sights and am so glad we did. Car hire- DO NOT hire a car in Rome or any city even Sorrento. We hired a car leaving sorrento to go up to Chianti. While driving the countryside is challenging but wonderful experience, it takes HOURS to travel a few kilometres to get out of town- best to check where the car pickup is and get out of town at an airport which are usualy a little way out but you dont have to take 2hours to get on your way going through traffic.Do not accept an upgrade, you want the smallest car possible as the larger cars do not fit through some streets!", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coppell", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "TERitter", "ReviewID": "UR116134362", "Content": "We stayed one night here prior to moving on to Tuscany.

It is not understandable that the hotel did not flag this up when I later reconfirmed my reservation. Had it been the busy season in Rome we may well have had to turn around and go home.

The hotel is close to bus stops and tram stops making it easy to get to all the sites in Rome. One thing you should however bear in mind. The alleys of Trastevere are very narrow and difficult to navigate in a big car especially on a Friday or Saturday night. There are so many cars parked all over making it impossible to drive through, unless you are familiar with the place. This made it very difficult for us to get to the hotel on Friday night when we arrived from Tuscany. We had to stop the car a fair distance away and wheel our baggage down the streets to the hotel. Our rental car driver, who was from Rome also had some trouble finding the place on another occasion. Good instructions and map on the website would certainly help in this respect.

So he looked out the window and saw the creepy guy in the window with the torn screen sitting there staring out. We both watched him as he took his hand outside the screen and pulled it back (signaling someone? peeping tom?) and then looked left, up, down and around. We kept getting up to check, he was there for over 3 hours doing the same, looking around and sometimes smoking a cig. Finally he turned off the light of his room but came back to look around again for a long time! The next morning after we failed to get our requested wake-up call and was running late, I asked the front desk clerk about the guy in the window with the torn screen. He responded by looking down, avoiding eye contact with me and stating, he just sits there sometimes and smokes. Really?? Hmmm. I didn't question him further because it must be an issue with the hotel, must get complaints all the time? One more thing, the desk clerk lied to us about the difference between the hotel's private car to the airport for a rate of 55 euro's vs a city taxi, who's rate can be anything at all, not cut-rate.

We had long wanted to stay in this district of Rome and the Hotel Santa Maria has made it a memorable one Trastevere is well served by public transport and it was easy to visit the Caravaggio 400 and the new Maxxi gallery.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAn Oasis in Rome\u201d", "Author": "MichaeloftheNorth", "ReviewID": "UR65495854", "Content": "We enjoyed our two night stay at the Hotel Santa Maria in the Trastevere neighbour hood - 30 min walk to the Vatican and 45 min walk to the Coliseum. The hotel is located in a safe area with lots of restaurants and bars, but very much geared to tourists. Our room (#2) was spacious, clean and quiet at night. Most rooms face a lovely courtyard with orange trees. We ate our breakfasts in the courtyard. Our only complaint was the absence of air conditioning in our room. We called the front desk and were told that it took some time to come on... it did not. The next night we were told that a Rome City By-law did not permit the use of air conditioners until June 1st. When we were checking out, the front desk person told me that the air conditioner was broken. We would stay here again, but would make certain first that the AC is working, especially at the end of May. Because of the ground floor location, windows open onto the courtyard with not much breeze, so keeping curtains open is not an option, and not much cool air gets in at night. The hotel was very accommodating in booking our restaurant reservations and taxis. For real local cuisine and Roman atmosphere, we recommend Piccola Trattoria da Lucia (Vicola del Mattonato 2) in the Trastevere neighbourhood just a few blocks away from the hotel or Ristorante Maccheroni (Piazza delle Coppelle 44) near the Pantheon. Piccola Trattoria da Lucia is a family run restaurant and has been cooking up amazing dishes since 1938. Highly recommended. Ristorante Maccheroni was recently reviewed in Jamie Oliver's food magazine, though the food was good the staff could be a little rude towards tourists. We also had to send back the pasta with chick peas dish because it was way too over-salted. But the truffle pasta and the grilled sausages were great, as was the caprese salad.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "boston", "Title": "\u201cpeace in trestevere\u201d", "Author": "favarabrighton", "ReviewID": "UR65417019", "Content": "i've stayed all over rome and i think i have found my favorite. trestevere is a great area, and hotel santa maria is an oasis in the middle of it. this is my first time staying here, but i'll be returning again and again, hopefully", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cPerfectly situated with excellent atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "StefanS68", "ReviewID": "UR65371516", "Content": "Perfectly situated with excellent atmosphere This small hotel is situated perfectly in the center of Trastevere with good restaurants in the close area.

All good that is said about the hotel is true. Nice, clean rooms, absolutely friendly staff, great location, etc. I want to add some useful tips that will make your stay there even more convenient: 1. We've stayed there with a 10 year old child so we needed a 1-bedroom apartment (junior suite). In fact there are 2 types (at least that I know of) of junior suites in the hotel - look at my picture with the scheme - room 14 which in fact is a standard 1-bedroom suite - a living room that you enter - with 1 single bed (plus a rollaway bed), a bathroom and a sliding door leading to the double bedroom. It's OK if you wish to say good night to you child and lock yourself in the double bedroom. Mind that if you'll want to visit the bathroom you'll have to go through the living room with your child and open the bathroom door exactly in front of his bed (and switch on the light there). Or if you'll want to go to the yard, which is really nice, you'll also have to pass through the living room and open the front door. But there is another junior suite 12 that is different - you enter the double bedroom with the bathroom and there is a separate room with a single (bunk) bed behind the sliding door (more convenient if you don't want to disturb your child or go to the yard). Look at the layout in my picture and be sure to book the one that suites you. 2. The taxi from the Fiumicino Airport is 40 Euro. It is the fixed rate to the center of Rome (including Trastevere) no matter what the meter says. Ours said ~43. But be sure to tell the driver the exact address (and show it on the map) since the drivers don't like to go into the narrow streets and may drop you a couple of blocks before the hotel (like our driver did) though the hotel IS accessible by car and the taxi CAN drive you to the front door (just be more insnitent). The same rate (I am not sure about the fixed price) will be for the taxi to the airport but you have to get it at the nearest taxi stop on the main street (Viale de Trastevere). 3. There is a cheaper way to get to the hotel from Fuimicino Airport - take a train to Trastevere station (7 stops, 30 minutes, 5,5 Euro), don't take the Leonardo Express (11 Euro) that goes to Termini station, it's not the one you need. Then take a 8 tram to Belli, just before the river (6 stops, 1 Euro), and then there is a 300 meters walk to the hotel (see Google maps) 4. The hotel is not exacly located close to the landmarks (30 min walk to Colosseo or Vatican) but don't be confused by that - if don't feel like walking some day you may take a bus or tram from the Belli stop on Viale de Trastevere - tram 8 will bring you to Argentina - a more central location, bus 780 - to Piazza Venezia, bus H - to Termini (via Piazza Venezia). The fare is always 1 Euro. There should be some bus to Vatican on the other bank of the river as well. 5. There are lots of good restaurants nearby - so you'll easily find a decent meal not far from the hotel. The restaurant around the corner from the hotel is good and another one nearby - at Vicolo de' Cinque, I think it's called \"del Moro\" - is absolutely great, you'll recognize it by the meat window at the entrance. 6. Though the yard is really nice you are not alowed to consume any food or drinks not purchased at the hotel there - so drink the wine in the room and breath the air in the yard.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cin the future, this is the only place in Rome I'll stay.\u201d", "Author": "nonamevirginia", "ReviewID": "UR60481280", "Content": "What a wonderful, relaxing location with a great history and friendy staff.

We walked into town every day and/or took the #8 tram. We had dinner in Trastevere 2 out of the 3 nights we were there. The staff made two excellent restaurant recommendations for us, Roberto and a young woman (I can't remember the young woman's name) were extremely helpful. When I told Roberto that I ate seafood but no other meat he even told me a specific pasta dish to order at one of the restaurants that was indeed to die for (must have had a pint of heavy cream and a pound of butter in the sauce so good thing we walked a lot, LOL), and the seafood I ordered at the other restaurant was also superb. They drew out walking routes to help us find things including the nearest laundromat. They also arranged our taxi to the airport, which we shared with two other guests in order to save some money.

First off... the first night we were here our sheets were very dirty. Second, my wife and always leave our stuff a certain way when we leave our hotel room. The next day we had left and returned it looked as if some one had gone threw all our stuff. Finaly what really gets me is the day we are going to check out. I go into there office and tell them my flight is the next morning so i will be leaving very early. They offer us a wake up call at 5:30 and a taxi at 6:30 for that sunday morning. Sunday comes no wake up call. I go in the office at six to make sure the taxi is comming the guy is sleeping on the desk. I tell him we our checking out he says everything is good. He waits till my wife and i our in the taxi to run out like a mad man and accuse me of skipping out on the bill!! I have all the info from expedia.com and the credit card to prove ive paid in full. He refuses to look at it and tells me i have know idea what im talking about! He demands money get very loud... So i have to pay again or risk getting the cops called and missing my flight! The debit card i have to use does not have the funds to cover this so i get a big over draft fee. I spend 40 minutes on my cell phone at a dollar a minute trying to get expedia to fix this mess! as off today the 12th of jan i have not been refunded any money and no contact from the hotel .

No water on the floor or anywhere else it did not belong. If the temperature had been a bit higher (it was about freezing the whole time we were there) it would have been enjoyable to sit outside in the courtyard under the shade of the orange trees. Breakfast was a fairly standard European buffet with the juices, breads, cheeses and meats. The afternoon 'party' with free food but drinks bought at the bar was also an enjoyable feature. On the negative side the place is difficult to find the first time. Once you know where it is located it is not a problem. The entrance also might put some people off. You must buzz to be let in through a heavy iron gate that serves to keep people/cars out of the approach to the hotel. Feels a bit like entering a prison although it might give some a sense of security. While they provide internet service it only works in the breakfastroom/bar area. It is not available in the rooms.

My only issue was with one their employees. I'm a very laid back individual and always courteous with the staff. This one lady they have working there continually gave us dirty stares and purposely tried to difficult when we had a basic question or two. Early in trip I asked for internet access. She wouldn't give us the password to the internet until noon even though there were others online as early as 7 in the morning all week. We also asked her to book us a cab to the airport on our final day and she neglected to do so. I only found this out five hours before we had to leave. On the last day we also had our bags by a gate that opens up to let cars in. She arrived at work the same time we were leaving and she saw us in front of the gate and didn't even have the courtesy to let us get our bags out of the way before she opened the gate. We had to scramble just to keep our luggage from getting knocked over and she had the nerve to glare at us as she went by? Not sure what her problem was but clearly it was intentional. I'm not sure of her name but I saw her driving a Nissan Murano SUV and a motorcycle on different days and she works in the morning so please be careful in dealing with her. They also have another staff member there named Roberto, he's great and truly a great representative of the hotel. The rest of the staff were helpful as well.

Negatives: One of the staff members was not only lazy and inattentive, but went out of her way to lie to us and kept lying even when called on it. When we arrived and checked in, the woman at the reception desk confirmed that our room was ready, then asked us to wait outside for \"five minutes\" before she would show us to our room. The five minutes stretched into more than 40 minutes as she chatted with a coworker. The same woman was managing the desk when we checked out. We asked her to call a taxi; before she did so, she asked where we were going, and we said \"the airport\". We then waited outside for the taxi to arrive. When the car arrived, we attempted to confirm the price would be 40 euros, as is the law in Rome. The driver said no, then went inside to talk with the hotel woman; the woman on staff then came outside and tried to tell us that because it was a Sunday (\"a holiday\") that the regular rate doesn't apply. When we pointed out that the day of the week had no bearing, she tried a different excuse: that the rate only applies to travel to/from the center of the city. This again, was patently false, as the law explicitly includes everywhere within the city walls, where we most certainly were. To be clear, she was not trying to come up with possible reasons the driver would be charging more than legally allowed, but actively arguing for the higher charges and lying through her teeth while doing it. I can only assume that she or the hotel itself get some sort of kickback from the customer getting scammed, as she went out of her way to even get involved in the first place.

We have a 15-year-old and a 6-year-old, so accommodation can be tricky in Italy. Bunk beds won't work for our teenager, neither will a pull-out couch generally (mattresses are always so bad, he ends up with backaches). This room had 2 separate twin beds in a loft atop of a generous main room where my husband and I slept comfortably in a large queen bed. Bathroom was spacious and comfortable. The room was clean, there was also a good amount of clothes storage capability as well as a room safe. Service was quiet and efficient, and breakfast was very good: a step above most continental breakfasts offered in Italy. But the best part was the courtyard, where we had breakfast amidst orange trees. When we first got to Trastevere, the area in which the hotel is located, we had to navigate through a series of maze-like streets and asked directions a couple of times to just find the hotel. Once we did find it and buzzed at the gate to enter, it was as if we'd passed through the gates of heaven itself. The hotel offered a tranquil setting, a really sanctuary, in contrast to the vibrancy and busy-ness of Trastevere. We couldn't believe we were right in the middle of Rome! Only a 20 minute walk from most of the major tourist sites at the most; 30 minutes, maybe, to the Vatican. Surprisingly, there were many families with kids staying there of varying ages. We never took public transit, so I can't comment on that. Lots of nightlife in Trastevere, but that wasn't our thing; although we got back around midnight or later, both nights we were there, we never felt unsafe walking around. Great little shops selling wonderful shoes you won't find anywhere else, lovely unique stores and restaurants galore. Many restaurants are trying to fight against the tides of tourists proudly proclaiming they offer no tourist menus. One of my husband's cousins, a Roman for over half her life, met up with us at the hotel and marveled at our find.

Most seemed just simply disinterested, period. They avoid eye contact and no hellos or goodbyes. They simply do their job. Ask for a glass of wine and she will pour it and walk away. Service with a smile is not a concept here. 2. The area feels like the slums with grafiti and trash everywhere. 3. Too far from metro. Bus route is nearby though, but the destination options are limited. Taxi is very expensive and will not try to negotiate the narrow alley the hotel is located in. 4. The afternoon snacks are poor quality, almost unedible - and the wine is too expensive - over $10 per glass - more expensive than the restaurants. For breakfast, the only warm food is scrambled egg. But, the eggs were runny (undercooked) and we were concerned about food-borne disease. 5. Very thin walls. You can hear the entire hotel. Light sleepers will suffer. Late night partiers will keep you up. Early risers with kids will wake you up early. The church bell goes off every 15 minutes. Reasons to stay at this hotel: 1. The hotel has a nice court yard with orange trees. But, after the initial impression of \"that's neat\", it's no big deal. Not worth the high hotel price. 2. The orange trees give off a nice scent. But the oranges are not the edible variety. 3. The receptionists speak english and will provide basic services such as recommending restaurants and giving you a map of how to get there. 4. Lots of restaurants nearby. But, they cater more to the locals. Tourists are rushed to leave. One restaurant actually has a sign saying they are against tourists and war. 5. The free internet can only be used from noon to 10pm. For us, this meant we could not use it before the start of our day and by the end after dinner, it was too late.

Its a bit of a walk to the touristy stuff (colleseum, Trevi, etc.) but no big deal. We would walk to all the sights and at the end of the day if we ended up too far from the hotel we would just take an relatively inexpensive cab ride back. The immediate neighborhood is great. Abour a million reasonably priced and tasty restaurants within a 15 minute radius of the hotel. Lots of interesting shops as well. Less touristy than other parts of the city. The courtyard surrounded by orange trees was ideal for relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. Breakfast was basic but good and the service excellent. Afternoon snack was also nice though we weren't always able to take advantage of it. The desk people were always helpful in booking tours, recommending restaurants or just giving some general advice. The only downside I can think of is the churchbells at the Santa Maria go all night every 15 minutes. But I'm a light sleeper and it didn't really bother me. Also, it can be difficult to find as its on a tiny street hidden among other tiny streets in Trastevere. We just told the cab drivers to drop us off at the Piazza Santa Maria and we walked the last two minutes back to the hotel. That's the only cons I can think of about this hotel.

My wife and I stayed at this quaint hotel, a former cloister in early January 2009. It is located in the Trastevere area of Rome which is across the Tiber River (Trastevere actually mean 'across the Tiber) from most of the major sites (Colisseum, Forum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navonna, etc.) It is an easy walk to any of these sites. You may have to walk a little further to some of these sites than if you stayed in central Rome but you would miss out on great views of the Tiber River and an authentic Roman neighborhood experience. Also, Hotel Santa Maria is an EASY busride on the #23 to The Vatican. The walk to the Colisseum is about 30 minutes and the walk to the The Vatican is also about 30 minutes in the other direction. Hotel Santa Maria is an oasis in the middle of Trastevere. This part of Rome is less commercial and has been described as crusty or gritty but don't be scared off by these descriptions. If we had stayed in any of the other hotels we passed along a more beaten path, we would have missed this experience. The area around the hotel has narrow, cobbled stone streets and at night is very well lit. At NO POINT did we ever feel unsafe which is a concern for some people when they go to a foreign city and don't know the area where they are staying. Once you enter the green gate from the street and walk down past the ivy-covered wall that leads to the front door, you feel like you are in a different world. It is secluded, quiet, inviting and comfortable. If we had been there with warmer weather we would have spent more time hanging out in the courtyard after a long day of sightseeing. Mid January isn't prime hanging out weather in Rome. The rooms are comfortable and clean. They are not huge but how big a room does a monk or a tourist need? The bathrooms are modern and clean and the water pressure in the shower is hard and relaxing. They give you fresh towels everyday and make up the room. There is also a safe in the room. The hotel provides breakfast in the morning from 7:30 until 10am. Everything from pastries, yogurt, cereal and fruit to eggs and breads. There is also a choice of juice. The hotel has a computer with internet access but the time it is available is limited. I think you can't use it until noon. Not sure why. Trastevere is also a good place to find food. The hotel staff is good at recommending restaurants in Trastevere. You must try either Taverna Trilussa or ai Fionaroli. (I'm going from memory here on the names but I know I'm close on the spelling) It seems like I should put some detracting qualities about this because no hotel ever gets it exactly right. For us, however, it was a perfect little place with helpful, courteous staff and no problems. I highly recommend this place to anyone heading to Rome and wanting a quiet, clean place to stay. Also, you'll love hearing the church bells in the neighborhood ring.

After a short walk down Via del Piede we came upon the gate leading to the hotel, nestled at the end of a private alleyway and full of charm right from the start. The first night we stayed in the larger Mansard room which is very practical for a family (we have 3 teenage daughters), with two bathrooms, one with shower. I believe this is the only room that is upstairs and does not open into the courtyard filled with orange trees. Nonetheless it has a nice view through skylight windows though be forewarned that the ceiling is a bit low. The remaining 3 nights we switched to the suite (not available the 1st night), which is more like a small apartment. Well worth spending the extra money if you can, since the high ceiling and mezzanine loft with 2 beds is spacious and comfortable, tastefully decorated. (The suite can hold 6 people; the only drawback is there is only one bathroom, which some people may think is a problem). It opens up onto the courtyard, with a little bench right outside the door. Since it was November, breakfast was served in a charming old room with vaulted like ceilings instead of in the courtyard. A copious selection of cold cuts, pastries, cereals, juices, bread, lots of drink choices too. Another nice amenity is the little \"cocktail hour\" which starts around 5 pm, serving little aperitif snacks (free, but you have to pay for drinks). They also lend bicycles for free, and a bike trip around the neighborhood is well worth it ! Also, they lend umbrellas and have a computer for internet use. The staff were very helpful and nice. The hotel really is a gem tucked away in a great neighborhood, a bit out of the tourist area (such as Spanish steps, Trevi, Vatican) but only a short walk to all those main sites. So no problem with location. The neighborhood is booming with restaurants, street vendors selling jewelry, scarves, etc. but yet we didn't feel like we were in a tourist trap. So altogether I would highly recommend this hotel to just about anyone, except perhaps those with very young children (since it is so quiet and secluded). Even our teenagers loved it (and we all know how teenagers can be a bit blas\u00e9). The hotel also gives a discount if you pay in cash. The only thing to be wary of is the tour brochures at the front desk. We took a \"Rome by night\" tour which turned out to be in a covered bus with the tour guide speaking 4 or 5 languages, couldn't see too much and by the time he said it in our language we had already passed by the sight. (We actually left the tour early). Don't know about the other tours in the brochure, but I'm sure you could find better if you look elsewhere.

We enjoyed returning to wine and snacks in the late afternoon and unwinding and relaxing in the courtyard, before heading out in Trastevere to any one of the great restaurants. The hotel staff were really helpful in suggesting wonderful places to eat, but it was also fun to wander through the cobblestoned streets and choose ourselves. The hotel offered to arrange transportation from the airport to the hotel for us and it was definately worth the 55 Euros. The driver drove us through the narrow cobblestoned streets right through the gates of the hotel, it would have been very difficult for us to have found the hotel otherwise as it is really tucked away.

This place was peaceful, charming and inviting, the evening happy hour was a wonderful chance to relax after a day of sight seeing in the busy streets of Rome. The included breakfast was also appreciated. Great walking distance from anything you'd want to see. Enjoy! S.

The hotel is a few minutes walk off the Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere down narrow little streets/alleys, and it is further removed from the street by a long driveway. It was very quiet, save the occasional talkative guests in the courtyard. Everyone on the staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms are around a central courtyard that's very picturesque. Breakfast included a good variety of fruit, cereal, meats and pastries; several varieties of juice plus coffee, hot chocolate. Stayed in room 21, which can sleep 5-6 people between the main room and a little sleep loft. Nice space, comfortable, clean. Getting to the hotel the first time was a little tricky...have posted photos showing the path from the Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere.

Besides finding more lovely bars and restaurants, you'll find your way to the hotel after a few minutes and at no time will you be in danger, as the streets in the area are always well populated with locals and tourists. A tip for those of who like to take your own music away with you, there are no DVD/CD players in the rooms. So, take your own, either a portable player or a docking station with speakers and your iPod. I found this out beforehand and fortunately we took our iPod and speakers... We took a taxi from the airport [they are capped at \u20ac30 by the government], so that cost us \u20ac30 plus a \u20ac5 tip. However, because we wanted to take no chances [time wise] when we returned to the airport for our flight home, we took up the hotel's offer of their own driver to the airport.

This was our first time in Rome. I had my fingers crossed that the hotel was going to be wonderful and not a bust. I was extremely happy from the very beginning almost until we stepped on the plane. We used the car service from the hotel for 50E's. The driver was good and showed us some of the sites on the way to the hotel. When we arrived at the Santa Marie we were pleased with the building and courtyard. We arrived around 11am and our room was not available until after 1pm. I wish we could have checked in immediately but instead we dropped off our luggage and started looking around outside the hotel compound. The hotel provides a map that is ALL you will need. We saw some tourists using their maps from their travel guides and they usually were asking people with real maps for directions. Honestly this map was great. We found many places close by for lunches and dinners. It really is a great location for a hotel. We returned around 2pm and went right to the room. We had the Jr. Suite (Rm 14) It was nice. Two rooms seperated by a sliding door. The bathroom was nice too. Each of the sleeping areas had flat screen TV's (only CNN, BBC and MTV were in english, but that is okay). The beds were comfy and the pillows were good too. There is a small closet with 10ish hangers, 4 shelves and a small safe. (A lap top will not fit in the safe. Some larger cameras might not fit either). The towels were a bit rough but really large. No wash cloths only hand towels. There was a blow dryer, 3 small bottles of shampoo, a small pack of tissues, shower cap, and a shoe shine cloth in the room. Oh...there is little to no circulation in the rooms. We had the heat all the way off and slept with the windows open. I wish there would have been a fan. This meant we heard most of the morning noise from the courtyard. It was not too bad though. We slept in every day except the day we returned home. Breakfast was yummy. The scrambled eggs were a nice touch to a normally boring continental breakfast. We had cappuccinos and egg sandwiches almost every morning there. The courtyard and facilties are beautiful. The hotel is very clean. We never had loud guests that annoyed us or rude staff. They were helpful when we needed them. The hotel had a free bike rental (and they were in good shape) and nice umbrellas that could be borrowed in the event of rain. My only negative little bit is that I requested a car service for our return trip home. We ended up with a taxi instead. Well the taxi driver thought it was okay to drive in excess of 100 mph down the streets of Rome. I asked him to slow down and we all expressed that we were frightened by his driving. When were arrived at the airport (10mins from leaving the hotel) he laughed and asked for a tip for getting us there so fast. I was a little peeved. The first driver was wonderful and well worth the 50E's. But this driver made me really mad. I don't know if it is fair to blame this on the hotel so I am mainly just not really excited that we had a taxi instead of the car service. All in all we would absolutely recommend this place to our friends, family and anyone else that wants a great location, great atmosphere and wants to feel you got the most for your money. The price of the room was great. (we paid 250E's a night for 3 people in the Jr. Suite) I think that is wonderful!! The location is really good too. I am super lazy (or so my husband says) and I don't care to do miles upon miles of walking just to see more old stuff. But in Rome we walked from the hotel to every where. It was about 20-30 mins to the Vatican and the Collissium. And that was not a fast walk...we were looking around at all the beautiful stuff/buildings/people. Piazza Navona was a really quick walk (if you don't get lost....like my hubby did...I navigated after that one) from the hotel. Not to mention the Piazza by the hotel had some great places to eat. Stay there...you will be pleased. For Americans travelling in Europe for the first time...please keep in mind the standards are different. In some countries customer service is not what is in the US. (Rome was great though) Also the size of hotel rooms are normally smaller (this hotel still had great sized rooms). Breakfast at a US hotel might not be the kind of breakfast you will get abroad, but it is usually included in the room (breakfast at Santa Marie was tasty!) so don't complain too much. Different countries are different for a reason so enjoy the experience! If you wanted everything to be like it is in the US then don't visit another country. But if you want a true picture of Rome the Santa Marie is definately the place to stay. 3 stars is being very modest. I felt this was a 4+ hotel easy.

The Residenza is smaller than the original hotel but with equally spacious and well-furnished rooms. In addition to the entire building being quite beautiful, our room was very clean with comfortable beds and a good bathtub/shower. The location was perfect - safely tucked right in the heart of Trastevere, surrounded by plenty of great pizzerias, restaurants and gelato joints. Trastevere is just across the river from the city and the hotel is roughly a 10-15 minute walk from Piazza Venezia or Campo D'Fiori, putting some of the highlights of the city well within rech if you don't mind a little bit of a walk. The hotel offered us unlimited and free usage of the lobby computer as well as a complimentary breakfast of various pastries, breads, meats cheeses, cereal, juice and coffee. The bar at the main Santa Maria also offers appetizers at 5:30 that we could've actually substituted for dinner quite happily. Most of all the staff at the Residenza was courteous, helpful and extremely friendly. These people were a crucial part of our stay and we were happy to have chosen the Santa Maria and found such an exceptional staff.

I would suggest that room 2 is potentially the noisiest one and should be avoided if possible. Breakfast is just OK with a small selection of cold meats, cheeses, yoghurts. Scrambled eggs was available every morning. The bread and rolls selection was very limited, 1 type of bread and 1 type of roll, both quite dull. Great selection of tea / coffee available with breakfast. The prices in the bar, and mini-bar, are very reasonable. Go for the 15 Euro per bottle rather than the 5 euro per glass!! There is no tea / coffee making facility within the room. The thing that really amazed us was the huge amount of graffiti around the whole area. Every surface is covered by it and don't be surprised if when dining in one of the many restaurant outside seating areas if you are right next to a vandalised wall. The area immediately around the hotel looks completely run down during the day but is transformed at night by the dozens of restaurants that spring out from behind their steel, graffiti covered, security shutters. Overall I would recommend the Santa Maria as something quite different from the run of the mill.", "Date": "September 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cHate to be the one to complain\u201d", "Author": "Formann", "ReviewID": "UR8682041", "Content": "Very surprised.

There was a riverside market nearby - which was a nice touch. But the river was filthy with floating garbage and the vendors just sold the same touristy stuff we had seen elsewhere. The worse part was that even after leaving a wakeup call the afternoon prior to our flight home and re-confirming it before going to sleep, there was no wake up call (and no way to enter a wakeup call via phone.) Thankfully, one of us just woke up early, yelled at the rest and with 15 minutes to shower and repack for our flight home, made the pre-arranged ransportation.

However, we found the choice a bit limited, particularly as it was exactly the same food that was on offer every morning. Secondly, the rooms are not as quiet as I had hoped. There were two main sources of noise. The first was the noise from the concerts in the nearby square. On some nights the music/singing was still going on well past midnight. The second was from other guests moving making a noise. Lastly, the air conditioing wasn't very effective which meant that it was too hot to sleep some nights. To be fair, Rome was unusually hot when we were there. Looking more positively, our room was easily large enough as was the bathroom.

That\u2019s because we had two different rooms owing to the fact that we had to change rooms on our last night there. Our first 3 nights at HSM were spent in an inner courtyard room. It was tucked away toward the back of the property. The room was clean, had a great bathroom with a deep tub, working air conditioning, and was Q-U-I-E-T. We loved it! However, due to their prior bookings we had to change rooms on our last night. We were moved to a supposedly \u201csuperior\u201d room that was anything but. It was the front-most room, the room you\u2019d walk past to get to all the other rooms. Although it was bigger (having an extra bed for a child) the bathroom was small, with only a shower that was enclosed only by a shower curtain. The air conditioning did not work nearly as well as in our original room. And the worst part of staying in this \u201csuperior\u201d room was that you could hear the clanging of plates and singing of patrons from a nearby restaurant at night. We were leaving early the next morning and this was NOT how we wanted to spend our last night in Rome. The night auditor told us that the restaurant is allowed by law to carry on with the singing until midnight and at midnight the noise did cease. So if you\u2019re a light sleeper or want a quiet area make sure you get a room toward the back of this property. Aside from the above, this hotel *is* like a little oasis. The courtyard is lovely, the breakfast choices are tasty and plentiful, and I DID find the staff to be cordial and helpful. It\u2019s also near some convenient bus stops for getting around. If I was writing this review based only on staying in our first room I\u2019d give it a 5.0. But the miserable experience of the \u201csuperior\u201d room brings it down to the 4.0 (since I can't give it a 3.5). If we would have had to stay in this room for more than one night I'd have changed hotels.

This hotel is in a trendy section of Rome, about a 20-minute walk to ancient Rome and a 30-minute walk to the Vatican. (However, both can be easily reached by public transportation.) Bottom line: the hotel is a great get-away. Hotels in Rome are pricey, but here, you can get 10 percent off for noting that you discovered the hotel in a travel book (ours was in a Karen Brown guide) and another 10 percent off if you pay cash. The hotel itself is gated, making it completely secure to those worried about such things.

If there is one piece of advice I could give, it would be: DO NOT DRIVE. We got lost for 45 minutes at dusk in the neighborhood and were thoroughly frazzled by the time we arrived. It is much better to have a taxi drop you off and walk the five minutes into the neighborhood. - wireless internet access at the hotel doesn't exist.

I booked our room several months ago based on the reviews at Trip Advisor and the recommendation in Ric Steve's Rome 2007 guidebook. First, you can get a 10% discount for paying in cash; second, if you want a total discount of 20% as mentioned in Ric Steve's book, you MUST mention his guidebook in your original e-mail request to the hotel for reservations. The hotel is an oasis in the middle of a hectic, dirty Trastevere. The two courtyards are delightful, and the hotel is surprisingly quiet. However, be prepared for traversing dirty, smelly, crowded cobblestone streets hemmed in by walls covered with graffiti in order to reach the hotel. If such things, as well as beggars, street artists, and tourist \"junk\" vendors selling literally on the street offend you, you might look elsewhere. The room (we had a \"superior double\") was comfortable in the European style. A daybed style sofa was adequate for sitting, though the two straight-back chairs were more utilitarian than comfortable. The very clean bathroom is excellent with a generous tub (with both hand-held and overheard shower) for soaking away the aches and pains of a day on your feet. There are plenty of electric plugs (standard Italian two prong round plug) and the bathroom lighting is adequate. There is no lamp on the desk so reading or putting on makeup while sitting there is a challenge. The king bed (two doubles made-up together) is comfortable, though not \"cushy\". The bare cotto tile floor calls for slippers. The air conditioning (separate unit for each room) is not up to American standards. In temperatures above 80F it would not be adequate though better than nothing. We purchased a fan to augment air circulation which drew adverse comments from the staff. My main problem with the hotel was the attitude of the staff. I found the reception desk clerks stand-offish and not too helpful. The two Philippino maids and bus-boy bordered on surly. Though the hotel seems to cater to Brits and Americans, there was little effort to meet American expectations. The breakfast room opens at 7:30, and there is no chance for a cup of coffee prior to that. So, if you have an early morning plane, you may begin the day caffeine-free. There is no means for making coffee in the room. Our room had a mini-fridge though the hotel \"rules\" forbade putting any items purchased elsewhere into it. Also, one is forbidden to eat anything not purchased at the hotel while sitting at the bistro tables in the courtyard. We chose to ignore, though not blatantly, both rules as being ridiculous. However, these attempts to regulate our activities gave the impression of a petty bureaucracy intent on squeezing the last Euro from our wallet. The hotel is expensive enough (250 Euro per night before the 10% discount for cash) without resorting to this sort of thing. The hotel website makes much of a new \"computer room\". This consists of a computer set up in the breakfast room after 10:30 in the morning. It is not available prior to then.

There is no \"lobby\" as such at the hotel. There is a loveseat and a chair in the breakfast room, but no other place to sit on a rainy day except for your room. Regular double rooms have only a bed and a straight backed chair. The hotel is relatively close to a bus stop, taxi stand, and tram stop to take you where you want to go in Rome. Arranging pick-up at the airport for 55 Euro through the hotel worked well. The driver was there on time both coming and going. I think the Trip Advisor reviews of this hotel are accurate as far as they go which is why I have tried to fill in the blanks.

We found Hotel Santa Maria through web searches and reviews of hotels, so we felt compelled to write and let others know of this truly enchanting place. Rome is glorious! Although not filled with monuments and many other tourist stops, Trastevere is a vibrant area that contains the largest number of restaurants and bars per square meter within the city. This concentration provides for a lively, exciting area that is very picturesque during the day and quite lively at night, all while remaining very accessible to the major sights of the city. Our tour of Rome was filled with many footsteps. We walked throughout the city and it was wonderful to return to the intimate courtyard that is at the heart of Hotel Santa Maria to rest. As described in other reviews, it is the 'calm in the storm' of the hectic city of Rome. It was so comfortable sitting around in the afternoon under the umbrellas of the courtyard tables, sipping wine and house provided snacks while reflected on the day's sights and sounds. We reserved a double superior room at 250 euros per night, but the hotel offers a 10% discount if you pay in cash, so our room was 225 euros per night. After researching others throughout the city, we feel that this was well priced for the service, location, and amenities provided. The staff were friendly, helpful, courteous, and accessible.

The breakfast comprised of pastries, pies, eggs, meats, cheeses, cappucino, italian expresso, breads, juices and fresh fruits. A cab ride to the Colosseum will cost you about 7 Euro. A cab ride to the Vatican will cost you about 10 Euro. A cab ride to the Spanish steps will cost you about 10 Euro. The intial cab fare should start off at 2.33 euro. There are only two english speaking television channels provided by the hotel.

The average dish of pasta is only 7 euro and a fillet of beef can be had for 13 euro. The hotel provided us an airport transfer for 55 euro. My wife and I are very picky people.

There is also free internet access. The rooms are very clean and the staff was helpful. Trestevare is a great area with lots of night life, restaurants and street theater. It is within easy walking distance to many sights. Now the negative. We stayed in the junior mansard suite. This is a 2-level room. The lower level was set up with bunk beds for my children and it has its own closet and tv. The upper level is for the adults and this is where the problem lies. As a previous poster mentioned, the ceilings are incredibly low. My husband is 5'11 and I am 5'4 and even I kept bumping my head on the ceiling. My husband could barely stand up in the shower. Also, the bathroom has only one dim light on a side wall which makes it almost impossible to see anything in the bathroom. It was in the upper 60's when we were in Rome and we had to keep the one small window open all the time. This room must be unbearable in the summer. From what we could tell from looking in the windows of other rooms, they seemed quite nice. The hotel should tell you upfront about the ceiling height so that you can make an informed decision. All I can say is, if you book at this hotel and they offer you the junior mansard suite, ask for different room or look for another hotel.", "Date": "April 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "atlanta", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Choice\u201d", "Author": "travelj0urnalist", "ReviewID": "UR7301087", "Content": "A friend recommended this hotel, but TripAdvisor reviews cemented our decision to book.

We did. And we will the next time. The one disappointment is that there is no architectural trace of its convent origins (anyway, none that we could see) but you can imagine cloisters where two courtyards now exist. (Courtyards I can imagine making good use of with a glass of wine in the summer.) Clean, comfortable, hot water, good service, nice little breakfast area - in short, all one wants. But maybe above all, as only residents are allowed within the gates, a haven of quiet to come back to after a hectic day. (Quiet marred only by the occasional cat disagreement!) In addition, there are some wonderful little restaurants in the area. Not fancy, just that wonderful basic Italian fare that is famous the world over. (Just ask Tiziana at the desk; she never steered us wrong.) With special kudos going to nearby Quirino's (we're not vegetarians but their sauteed potatoes and artichokes were to die for) and maybe even best of all, the Taverna Trilussa. Divine. (Avoid: Checco e Carettiere's on the Via Benedetta. Unless you like waiting for a glass of water for 45 minutes. Still, they seem to be a tourist staple. Probably their problem.) Otherwise, a few recommendations: 1) to see THAT ceiling, go in the afternoon, not the morning; you're actually more likely to get in faster. 2) Get a ticket to the Opera, even if it's up in the gods - opera in Rome, a lot of fun. As was the Alexanderplatz for jazz. 3) Whether or not you like gardening (we're don't), venture outside the city to go to the Villa d'Este (the Hotel can help with a private tour or several other tours, for that matter) - we thought it was gorgeous. 4) If you're a lover of literature, don't miss the house Keats died in beside the Spanish Steps. (You could also seek out both his and Shelley's graves in the Protestant Cemetery, a landmark in itself.) 5) Skip the Caffe Greco near the Spanish Steps (just too crowded) and go to Babington's Tea Rooms instead - in that tourist stronghold, a surprisingly calm and delightful oasis. 6) And before you leave the Spanish Steps area, if you've got five minutes left in you, head for the Doria Pamphilj Art Gallery, dash in and make for Velazquez's Portrait of Innocent III - one of the great portraits of all time. 7) And finally, don't skip wandering around the Palatine right there above the Forum; I found it even more magical.

I booked it solely based on the positive Trip Advisor reviews and we were not disappointed. (Clarifying, I have been a travel agent since 1986 so I can be a little picker than \"the average joe\" at times.) As stated in just about every review you read, the rooms are small (definitely not claustrophobic, however) and immaculately clean. We stayed at 4 hotels in Italy and Santa Maria had the best shower hands down. The hotel is extremely quiet and almost feels like a little \"secret\" when you pass through the gates and slip into their peaceful hideaway in Rome. Yes, you do hear the bells from the church but they don't wake you up, we only heard them when we were awake and didn't find it aggravating at all - rather charming instead. Breakfast was good! Scrambled eggs, cheese and cold cuts, fresh juices, pastries, yogurts, and awesome coffee. Perfect way to start your day and we enjoyed eating there all 3 mornings. We were never back at the hotel in the evenings to take advantage of the \"Happy Hour\" so can't comment on that. We didn't borrow the bicycles but definitely used the umbrellas and were very thankful for those! Distance to \"the sites\" isn't bad at all. We walked to Vatican City in about 15 minutes. The longest we walked to get back to the hotel from various spots all over Rome was about 30 minutes. Is Santa Maria around the corner from Trevi Fountain or the Pantheon? No, of course not. But we very much enjoyed seeing the sites and then returning to \"our neighborhood\" which wasn't overrun with tourists and high prices. No one mentions the handy laundromat that is literally right around the corner from the gate to the hotel. On the day we were leaving we got up and started 2 loads of laundry. Then, walked the 15 seconds (I'm not kidding) back to the hotel and had our leisurely breakfast. Afterwards we walked back to the laundromat and put the clothes in the dryer. Then we wandered around Trastavere one last time before getting the dry clothes, packing them up and heading for the train station. Had we known we were going to be able to do laundry so easily we would have packed even less! Trastavere feels \"real\" as compared to other parts of Rome that are so big and sprawling. We loved the tiny (and I mean tiny!) winding streets. (Think wide enough for a mini van to pass through with little spare room on either side, perhaps a person could stand there but that's about it!) The food is wonderful and definitely cheaper than the \"hot tourist areas\". One night we got pizza from one of the many little pizza shops we had noticed wandering around and had a fine dinner for only 10EUR. There are lots of restaurants... lots of bars... and lots of activity at night with folks walking around enjoying themselves. I even walked around one night long after dark by myself (for about 30-40 minutes covering just about every little street within the neighborhood) and I never once felt the slightest bit threatened or intimidated. Is Santa Maria the BEST hotel in Rome? Well, of course there are 5 star hotels and luxury properties in locations closer to the tourist sites. If you want to pay more or be in those areas there are other hotels that will work for you. But, if you're looking for a more moderate expense you can't do better than the Santa Maria. And, to feel like you've experienced a true part of Rome that is \"real and authentic\"? Again, you can't do better. We stayed at a variety of hotels on our Italy adventure... 3, 4, and 5 stars so I have some basis for comparison.

Firstly, it's in a great location in the bohemian Trastevere area where there are some great bars and restaurants on the doorstep (after a full day sightseeing we didn't want to go too far)!Also, practically, it feels safe as the hotel is located within an enclosed wall with a secure entrance gate. The rooms themselves are not big (we upgraded on the last night to a superior room as our room was taken - having only booked a week ago) but really clean, warm and comfortable with lovely bathrooms. The staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast was also good and canapes are served in the evening. The hotel has some rickety bikes to use and this was a great way to see the city (we took them for two days). To get to the hotel from Fiumicino airport, we caught the train to Trastevere (about 30mins) and a tram (No 8) will take you down Viale de Trastervere, try to get off near Via San Francesco and walk down. (10 min). The hotel is just beyond the piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere, it's a bit tricky to find at first so you may need to ask someone. We ate at Pizzeria Da Ivo (Via de San Francesco) and PIzzeria Dar Poeta (vicolo del Bologna) - both were very good.

As central Rome is compact, it is possible to walk to any of the sights in 30 minutes max. The hotel also has bikes available to guests free of charge which are great as it is possible to cycle alongside the Tiber river (very close to hotel) walkway as well as to the sights if you feel adventurous. The breakfast was excellent, a buffet that comprised of fresh fruit (including oranges off the trees in the hotel courtyard), pastries, cold meats and cheeses and scrambled eggs. The rooms were comfortable and quiet, opening out onto the courtyard. In addition, 'aperitivi' snacks were available in the evening free of charge, as was internet access on a PC in the lounge from midday. Perhaps the biggest advantage of the hotel though is its neighbourhood, which is comprised of narrow streets full of local charm and many excellent restaurants. This is the area of the city where many locals dine out, so you can eat excellent food at the correct price (ie not get ripped off like you can near the tourist sights) in a huge choice of eateries.

You don't have busy traffic outside your window or all the hussle and bussle of the city out your door...which we found very relaxing. It's very easy to get to everything, the Vatican, the Colosseum, Trevi fountain, etc. We enjoyed the short stroll to see everything...it's not bad at all! We had the best stay at Hotel Santa Maria and loved Rome. The hotel staff was very pleasant and most helpful with any need we had. The breakfast was lovely, the internet a plus, and the bar and outside areas were just perfect. The rooms were VERY clean and the bathrooms great!!

If not--book the car service through the hotel because it is a little hard to find otherwise. Our favorite parts about this hotel: 1) The fact that it is different than a normal hotel. Because each room faces the courtyard, a long stay is more pleasant because you aren't going up in a windowless elevator and walking down stark hallways every time you return to your room. The orange trees in the courtyard were amazing to look at every day. 2) The breakfast was awesome. Scrambled eggs! 3) The breakfast room also served as a bar in the evenings. They had complimentary appetizers (like foccacia, etc) and then you had the opportunity to buy drinks. No pictures i've seen on here do the room justice. It's just really cute.

Our driver was amazing and was able to thread the extremely narrow streets of Trastevere in a very wide Mercedes without a scratch. We stayed at Hotel Santa Maria for 6 nights in September. After a warm welcome and easy check-in, we were escorted through the beautiful grounds to our room. When the door opened to our room we were really pleased with the wonderful accommodations. It was absolutely inviting and perfectly romantic. The hotel provided breakfast of scramble eggs, cheese, ham, cereal, fresh baked goods and fresh coffee in the dining room every morning for us to enjoy in the courtyard right outside our room. They also had bar service everyday to be enjoyed in the courtyard. Also located in the dining room was a computer with internet access free for hotel guests to use. Trastevere is the best place to be for night-life and great food in Rome. There are many restaurants, bars and little shops very close to the hotel. You can also reach many of the big touristy sights within an easy 30 minute walk max. Some places, like the Borghese Gallery, will take a bit longer, but the walk is nice. Rome is a very busy and crowded city, but Hotel Santa Maria is a perfect place to escape to with a glass of good wine in their courtyard at the end of everyday.

First nite we ate at a trattoria at an outside table on a narrow street with the local bus service passing within feet of our table ! Great experience. Loads of restaurants in the area, try to avoid the tourist traps though. Restaurant recommended by the hotel was the Taverna Trilussa (within 5 mins walk) and we weren't disappointed. Try the superb tasting menu for \u20ac65 per head, including a different wine with every course, a fantastic if eventually tipsy experience. Being used to overpriced restaurants in Dublin, this represented excellent value and was a real treat ! Another night we had a good meal including wine and 2 good courses each and one dessert for \u20ac40 all in !!!!!!! Unreal ! Hotel itself is well covered in other reviews. Staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms were very nice. Courtyard drinks in the early evening were a real treat, breakfast was fine, had all you need. We would thoroughly recommend getting hotel to book a transfer to direct form the airport for \u20ac55, as a normal taxi wouldn't have found it (even our driver was struggling with his mapat the end) and watching him manoeuvre his large merc around narrow streets and mopeds was entertaining to say the least ! Church of Santa Maria is 2 mins walk and is beautiful. Rest of Rome has so much to see and do we'd need a book to go through it. Don't miss St. Peters, Sistine Chapel, Colesseum and everything else !

We'd made a final selection of hotel from the review in Lonely Planet, reviews on Tripadvisor and the hotel's web site. It was a good choice in terms of the location in Trastevere as we never had far to go in the evenings when out looking for a restaurant. The vibe of the area added to the enjoyment. The fact that this smallish hotel is in a converted cloister with a pretty garden area literally does mean you can both escape the hustle after hours out siteseeing and relax in the shade for a while before the next onslaught out. We got to the point on our second and third day when we'd plan to get back around 4pm, take a break, relax with other guests and enjoy a cocktail (guest's expense) and snacks provided by the hotel, before heading out for the evening. In the heat of Rome in June this was welcome relief. The breakfast was great, with plenty of fresh fruit for those who don't want only breads, rolls and cakes. More than sufficient to sustain us for the day. The rooms aren't large but South Africans are used to that. Our bedroom and bathroom was quite adequate considering the little time we spent in it. Having aircon was essential. It was kept very clean as well. The staff are very friendly, speak pretty good English and help wherever possible. Just be aware that taxis cannot drive up to the entrance of the hotel as it is in a traffic restricted area and you may, like us, have to lug your luggage over the cobbles to one of the main streets to catch the taxi, tram or bus. Approximately a ten minute walk. Taxis are not always available when you need them as well due to high call rates, so we landed up having to walk, and catch a tram to the station on departure or risk missing our flight out. Trastevere may shock some initially. It does get very dirty, though streets are cleaned every morning, walls are full of graffiti, but this does add to the character of the area. We were there during the World Cup and Trastevere buzzed with locals and tourists alike in the evenings.

My review is probably about the same as most of the reviews about this terrific hotel. We had a misconnect on our way to Rome, which caused us to miss our first day in Rome. I contacted the hotel and they explained their cancellation policy meant that since we were within 3 days of staying, that we would usually have to pay for the entire first night, but they were very understanding and they were able to book the room for that night and not charge us. We arrived early the next morning, before check-in, and our room was not ready yet. We were able to leave our luggage at the hotel while we started our tours of Rome, and they brought the luggage to our room and left us some champagne and some of their pastry treats since it was our honeymoon. The breakfast in the morning is very good, and it's very important in Rome to have a good meal in the morning, because you will burn it off rather quickly. It didn't rain once, so we enjoyed our breakfasts in the courtyard every morning. The bells from the church of Santa Maria were very pleasant to listen to, and they are not as loud as some people advertise. Our room was of exceptional size for 2 people. Large bed, a desk, night stands. Flat screen TV hanging on the wall to maximize space. The bathroom is very spacious, with plenty of room to move around. The shower/bath are exceptional. The one giant advantage of this hotel is its proximity to Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere, which was always bustling with activity every night. There are excellent restaurants that were recommended by the hotel staff, that are short walks from the hotel. Just stay away from the restaurants in the piazza. They are rather pricy compared to some on the side streets. I booked this hotel by reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, and I advise those who are looking for a great place to stay and for a great price compared to the rest of Rome, to believe all of the good reviews that are written here and experience the greatness of Hotel Santa Maria.

This was our first vacation without children since our honeymoon 22 years ago. For anyone who wants to go to Rome but keeps making excuses, stop making them and go (and stay at this hotel)!!!! You will not regret it. We stayed here from June 5th-17th and loved every minute of it. We found the workers at the hotel to be friendly, helpful and accommodating. At no time did we feel as though they were rude or felt bothered. Breakfast was wonderful and the antipasti in the late afternoon was a nice touch to tide you over before dinner. The driver that we arranged through the hotel picked us up at the airport and drove us directly to the hotel through the streets of the city and we had a view of the Forum even before we got to the hotel. We were amazed at the narrowness of the streets and his ability to navigate them. The weather was wonderful (low 80's and sunny) and it only rained once late in the afternoon on the first day we got there, but it only seemed to make the courtyard of the hotel more beautiful (with the rain dripping from the orange trees). I thought the room was very spacious and immaculate. It felt very comfortable and like home. The only suggestion I would have for others who are used to using washcloths is to bring a couple of your own. The bells of the church are no problem at all and they do not keep you awake. We heard them the first few days just because the sound was new to us, but it was not bothersome at all. Others that complained of this in the past must have been staying at a different hotel or sleeping outdoors. Rome is busy and we walked everywhere, but we never had any trouble at all with traffic or motorcycles. Compared to any other major city we have here in America, I thought motor traffic was very courteous to pedestrians crossing streets. They just seem to take it all in stride. The food!!!! Pastry, gelato, pannini, pasta, risotto, carbonara, chick pea soup, shaved beef with rocket, the fruit markets........... I don't think we had one bad thing to eat the whole time we were there. Try eating at Augusto's that was recommended by the hotel. We also ate at Casetta(?) de Trastevere and Cilin (Chinese restaurant) in the neighborhood. All were wonderful. Drink the local wines - if you get headaches from red wine, you won't here. I don't think it has the sulphites that usually bring on the next-day headaches. Wear comfortable shoes to protect your arches!!!!! My feet were hurting by the end of the vacation. We took trains, subways, taxis and buses - transportation is very well organized and people were willing to help if you are confused. Recommend asking the fare if you come in to Termini Station and going back to the hotel - there was one driver who wanted to charge E35 (typically we paid between E8-11). We refused him and walked back to the hotel - a long walk but so much to see on the way back. If you still want to ride, just refuse them - the rate will usually go down or you can wait for another driver. If you need to make International calls back to the States, the Eurocard was the best. E5 for 200 minutes and very easy to use. A gret value and you can buy them at any Tobacco shop. We took the train to Venice for 2 days and returned at about dinner time on the third. The hotel we stayed at there was a four-star and was not as spacious. We thought the Hotel Santa Maria had more character and offered a much better value. We loved our time there, sorry to have had it all end so fast - but we're also glad to be back home with the kids. Thanks to the Hotel Santa Maria - we had a wonderful time!!!!

I'm a light sleeper and I have to say they had no impact at all. Even with a window open I found them very faint and pleasant--nothing more than you'd find a small Italian village. Perhaps there are some rooms that are located closer to them but I find it hard to imagine. The neighborhood itself can be very busy with tourists on a weekend.

We were worried that it would not live up to expectations but these worries were unfounded. The character and charm do not come across in the photos, it was really special, a perfect setting for any break in Rome and we preferred it to any of the anonymous 4* hotels we have stayed in Barcelona, Prague and Amsterdam. As you walk through the gates a peacefulness descends, the courtyard is delightful, the breakfast and afternoon snacks excellent, the staff very pleaseant and helpful, the rooms perfect, but overall the ambience is what made it special. The location is perfect, within walking distance to all tourist sites, yet at night when you don't want to walk anymore, Traestevere comes to life with excellent restaurants at every turn of the cobbled, narrow streets. One very special restaurant was 'La Trilussi', which we would highly recommend, their award winning ravioli was delicious and the atmosphere was fantastic, full of local italians. 'Il Duca' was also very good, excellent lasagne and very good value. Loved the 'No Smoking' policy in hotel and restaurants. This was an excellent base from which to explore an amazing city. 'Maximus' Tours gave us excellent guided tours of the Colisseum and Roman Forum, so much so that we went with them next day for their vatican tour, both well worth it , we would have missed so much without them. We have really special happy memories of the whole trip, from we were collected at the airport by a taxi arranged by the hotel, right down to our taxi drive back to the airport, where Fabrizio gave us a guided tour and commentary right to the airport, via the Appian Way.

The room, though small and modest, had a comfortable bed, good a/c and nice strong shower. Morning breakfast is lovely with cappuchino as we liked it served inside the breakfast room or outdoors in the courtyard. We too enjoyed the evening appetizers with a glass of italian red and enjoyed the opportunity to chat with the very friendly guests at the hotel. The staff is helpful but would suggest you choose your own restaurants and ask them to help with reservations(we were sent to La Torre and it was not very good). We especially enjoyed Asinocotto which is in Trastevere. We walked all over the city and finally got the hang of the public transport which is 4 Euro/day for a pass. The tram(i believe it is the # 8) is very handy for crossing the river ending at Largo Argentina where you can then walk to Piazza Venezia or Pantheon and related sites very easily. We even walked to the Vatican. Some fellow guests used the hotel's recommended tour company to see the Vatican on Sunday and waited in line many hours. We used the Angels tour to see the vatican on a thursday and had a good experience. On our way home we stopped at a cafe in the Piaza Della Scala to get out of the rain and had great pizza and pasta at a reasonable price. I do not know the name of the place but if you sit at an outside table you are sitting opposite the scuola materna i believe. We also used the Angels guides to see Ostia on a private tour which was enjoyable as well. Suggest you avoid the Museum of Rome in Trastevere even though it is close to the hotel. It is expensive and so empty that the guards follow you around-very creepy!!! Finally-be sure and take advantage of the 10% discount the hotel offers if you pay in cash. It will end up saving you 13% over using a credit card. This represents a great value when you consider that breakfast is included. I believe the hotel has a few larger rooms but we managed to put away most of our clothes and still have room to keep our suitcases out for the remaining items we could not put away.

We ate breakfast in the courtyard every morning, and every evening had a glass of wine, read or played cards in the courtyard before dinner. It would be the first hotel we would book if going back to Italy, although I suspect it is not for everybody. If you want to be steps away from major tourist attractions and hordes of tourists, or like to stay in large hotels with all the luxury amenities (it is very nice, attractive, and comfortable, but it's not a Four Seasons or Ritz), this probably isn't the place for you. We read both the good and bad reviews before going, and I think the secret is to have the right expectations and understand that not all people are looking for the same things, so here are the reasons why we loved it (and why someone looking for something diffrerent might not). Also, I will mention that w had perfect weather in Rome--if it had been raining our whole trip, some of our favorite things about the hotel (winding down in the courtyard at the end of the day, wandering the nearby streets) would not have been as enjoyable. Location. We absolutely loved Trastevere and the hotel's location there. There are tons of tiny restaurants on narrow cobblestone streets. The streets are lively with people (lots of young Italians and international students as well as others). We came back late every afternoon, sat in the piazza nearby having a gelato (never missed our gelato!) and watched kids play in the square, parents coming home from work and meeting their kids & nannies in the square, etc. At night, we just headed out to one of the nearby restaurants. Although there were tourists among the people on the streets and in restaurants, the vast majority were local people, which we loved. The hotel is within walking distance of major attractions IF you like to walk a lot. It is not mere steps or a block or two from the major sites or a major tourist areas. We loved that - we never met a pasta or gelato we didn't like, so we got our exercise by walking everywhere (we did take a cab once or twice, but for the most part we walked, and we logged a fair number of miles every day). And we loved coming \"home\" to an area that was out of the tour group areas. Noise. Some of the reviewers have mentioned noise. Trastevere is a lively part of town with a thriving night-life, so it probably isn't the quietest area of Rome (although I've never found large cities to be particularly quiet). If that's a big issue for you, you may want to give this some thought. We all slept GREAT - and I don't always. In fact, my only regret is that I slept so well in the mornings, I never got up early to use one of the bikes to ride along the Tiber in the morning, as our companions did. But those church bells really do ring every 15 minutes. While I heard them when awake, they never awakened me or kept me awake. Since the hotel rooms are all first floor and face outdoors (the courtyard area) you may get a little more noise than you would in a high-rise in other parts of Rome. Amenities. The courtyard was a wonderful place to start the day and to wind down after a long day of sightseeing. The free use of the internet during the afternoon and evening was a nice way to make a quick check of email. The breakfast was perfect for us - cereal, fresh melon every morning, coffee & juices. Again, if you're looking for a big American hotel buffet spread, you would probably be dissapointed, but it had everything we needed, and it was lovely to eat it outdoors as we mapped out our day. The rooms are very nice, pleasant and well-maintained, and had everything we wanted or needed. But if you are looking for thick towels and luxury (or big hotel) hotel amenities such as room service, it's not the place for you. Staff. The staff was very helpful. Some spoke English better than others, but I never had any trouble getting across what I needed or getting information I needed - I did a little pointing in the wine bar a day or two, but that's a pretty easy place to communicate! The hotel offered dining suggestions when asked, offered a variety of tour packages if desired, arranged our airport transportation, etc. We loved it.

It was also nice and quiet in the rooms making for a peaceful night's sleep despite the crowds of tourists and locals enjoying the area's many night spots and wine bars. The location is great for exploring Trastevere and is also just a short walk to the Campo di Foiri and Piazza Navona. Make sure to ask the hotel for some local trattoria recommendations. They'll be happy to oblige. The service is excellent and very personal and your stay includes buffet breakfast as well as complimentary snacks from 5:30-7:30 in the bar or the very charming courtyard (check out their site for photos) We also found they offer a 10% discount for paying in cash, which makes this already reasonable hotel a true bargain.

My husband and I like many people booked this hotel purely on the rave reviews on this site and the mention of \"oasis\". We have travelled extensively all over Italy for the past 5 years so we know a bit about Italian hotels. The Santa Maria is good for the money - in the grand scheme of things it is not expensive for Italy - I would describe it about average. The hotel rooms - 9 times out of 10 are this size all over Italy especially in the cities, this is the way places are built! especially if they are old! At the Santa Maria our room did not smell, yes it was a little small (but that is pretty much expected as I said) the air conditioning worked prefectly and it was nice and clean, the maids came and did their job therefore everything fine there. The staff were friendly and helpful, the cab that we booked from the airport wasn`t there when we got there but he turned up about 10 mins later but then our flight came in early so what do you expect? Yes I think that maybe it is a little far out if you have never been to Rome before/you only have a few days and time is of the essence but personally I loved the area, nice restaurants, nice square to sit and the bus stop was round the corner (not 10 mins away like somone else mentioned) - we had no trouble getting taxi`s or buses - its lovely to stay out of the serious tourist hub especially when it is that hot! Because my husband and I have seen Rome before and were there for a concert and a break we didn`t have to break our necks to get to EVERY sight like some so it was nice to be in a different district. As for dodgey people walking around of a night basically I thought the area was fine just take the same precautions you always should whereever you are no ? Yes the little courtyards of Santa Maria are cute to sit and have a drink and breakfast etc with trees and benches - Rome is a big, smelly, busy city and it is nice to go back and chill out without having to stay in your room. Breakfast pretty good, coffee very nice, staff doing breakfast very helpful. My biggest complaint would have to be about the other guests of the hotel, the rooms all face the courtyard and are very close together. WHY? are some people so ignorant and stand around outside your door having a loud usually boring conversation at 7am, some people are so inconsiderate! these particular people are all over the country though I am afraid.

We were delighted with the charm of the hotel, the location, the friendliness of the staff (hi to Antonio, Arianna, Conrad and everyone!). Trastevere is what some would call \"the real Rome.\" Full of great little sidewalk cafes that spring up in the evening, and tons of interesting and unique shops and artisans. A great base for exploring Rome. And our #1 recommendation for a spot to eat... Il Torre on the Natale del Grande, a 3-minute walk away. Superb food and cheap (by Roman standards). Speaking of which... We covered every corner of Rome by either taking a cab out to an area and then slowly meandering our way back. Or vice-versa. But if you're 60 years old and in reasonable health, don't worry about Trastevere as your base location, unless you hate walking. And if you hate walking, don't come to Rome at all -- it's one of the world's great walking cities, along with New York, Paris, and Hong Kong . (By the way, my wife and I are in our 50s and not in particularly great shape, just in case you're wondering if you can walk Rome.) And Trastevere has some unique location advantages. For example, it's only a 2-minute walk to lovely parks like Gianicolo and Villa Chiara (hope I have that spelling right) and the Botannical Gardens. You won't see many tourists at these wonderful little spots (well, maybe a few at the Botannical Gardens!). At the end of the day, after 6-8 hours of 33-40 degree heat (90-100 farenheit), coming back to the peace and quiet of Santa Maria quickly became a \"home away from home\" feeling. The hotel is set in a secluded spot, just off the Piazza Santa Maria, so is amazingly quiet. We ran into other tourists, and they often complained of Rome's noise from their rooms. Not here. And you won't make new friends at Rome's \"major hotels.\" But everyone tends to gather in the central courtyard/garden, shaded by canvas overhead. Wine and a nice little buffet-pre-supper snack soon leads to conversation and great stories/tips about Rome, or about life -- your choice. Breakfast is also free (and ample -- a full breakfast with eggs, fruit, meats, juices, cappucino, espresso, etc.), and gets you off to a satisfying, strong start to the day. We, a family of 4, stayed in 4 different rooms... the Mansard Suite which offers 2 separate rooms, which was a super-comfortable spot. Just remember to duck, as it's built right into what used to be the attic. But, as the pictures on its site, (---), show, it really is a fun and comfortable spot -- my wife and I would stay here without the children, too. We also stayed two days in two double rooms. They were charming and the girls were happy to be \"on their own.\" And finally, for the last 10 days we stayed in the Senior Suite, with the girls' special little space on the second floor, which they loved. In all rooms, the bathrooms were spic and span and spacious, with great, deep bathtubs to soak in, after a day on the cobblestones. I find it hard to understand how anyone could complain about this hotel. The staff is wonderful and genuinely friendly. (Thanks so much to Antonio for the flowers and cake for Nori's birthday -- what a surprise!) You get to meet other folks from around the world at breakfast and late-afternoon. The rooms are cool and totally comfortable. All of our rooms were more than big enough, especially given the reasonable price -- they give you a discount if you stay more than 4 days. Bottom line? Unless you are absolutely married to staying at \"just another Hilton or Marriott), you won't find a more Roman and enjoyable stay. I can't recommend it highly enough.

The staff were friendly, especially Chiara \u2013 who was a constant source of information from restaurants to directions. Not so good for children as there isn't much to do inside the hotel, but great for stressed-out adults needing some peace and quiet! Being right in the heart of the Trastevere area of Rome, we were surrounded by excellent restaurants (especially Trilussa) and ice-cream parlours - so much nicer than staying in the tourist area of the main part of the city \u2013 and make sure you walk up to Giancomo for wonderful views of Rome, only 15 minutes away. The wonderful sights of Rome were all within an hour\u2019s walk \u2013 but buy yourself a good streetmap before you go as Rome is a maze of small alleyways and piazzas.

Despite the second booking coming from a different email address, the hotel assumed it was me changing my booking, so they cancelled my booking without informing me. The mistake only came to light when I asked the hotel to book me a taxi from the airport in July and they replied saying that I wasn't staying with them in July anymore. By the time I found out, it was too late to get into the hotel for the dates I'd originally booked and therefore I've had to find acommodation elsewhere at short notice.

The driver was very courteous and helpful and knew exactly where he was going. This was important as the hotel is quite hard to find, located off the historic Piazza Santa Maria, but really only accessible on foot for the last part of the journey. We decided to use the same transport for our return journey, which meant being collected at 5.30am. The minibus was exactly on time and again, the driver was friendly and helpful. On arrival at the hotel we were told that there was a problem with one of the 3 rooms we had booked. We were disappointed and worried but were told that one couple would be put in a larger suite for the whole stay at the same price as a standard double and that another couple would then have to move into the suite for the last night. The suite was lovely and very large. Four of us sharing on the last night was not a problem at all as there were two toilets etc and we had to leave very early anyway. All of the rooms were very clean and well equipped for the price. The bathrooms were lovely, with powerful showers as well as baths and bidets. If you are sensitive to noise, this may not be the place for you. You can hear the bells from the nearby (beautiful) Santa Maria church and the fact that the rooms open out onto a central courtyard can make it slightly noisey at times but in our opinion, no more so than any other city hotel. We enjoyed the breakfasts which had an extra special twist on the usual European continental breakfasts, with homemade cakes and pastries and fresh fruit. We enjoyed great weather which enabled us to eat in the wonderful courtyard (photos included). The breakfast room becomes a tranquil bar in the evening (open until 10pm) complete with free, delicious canapes (bruschetta, cheese, ham, olives). The staff were very friendly and helpful. We easily explored all the sites of Rome on foot from the hotel, although realistically these are approximately 30 mins walk away (at a slow stroll). We knew this from the Trip Advisor reviews and decided we would rather walk during the day then be closer to a good choice of restaurants close to the hotel in the evenings. The area surrounding the hotel compromises tiny cobbled streets with a huge variety of restaurants and bars, which are much better value than those in the centre of Rome near the main sites.

You could get cappuccino refills and they had some really delicious pastries in addition to the usual meats, cheeses, breads etc. One of the best things about the hotel was the service. I especially liked the young girl who works in the breakfast room/bar in the afternoons and evenings. I wish I could remember her name because she was so nice and helpful. I also enjoyed talking to her whenever she had a free moment. The office staff was helpful and friendly even though our group had some cancellations and unexpected late arrivals. They were polite, helpful and calm during all these unexpected changes. I especially love the location and setting of this hotel. It is within its own walls and a world unto itself in the middle of Trastevere. It is 5 minutes from Ponte Sisto Bridge. Campo Fiori and Piazza Navona are just across that bridge. (10-15 minute walk at tops) It is surrounded with great restaurants in all directions. Trastevere and Hotel Santa Maria combine to provide a wonderful place from which to visit Rome.

I was really excited about staying in the Santa Maria based on all the positive reviews. I can see why some people love this hotel, but I was disappointed and won't be going back their the next time I visit Rome. I will try to list some of the things you should consider (both positive and negative) in deciding if this hotel is right for you: - The hotel is in the Trastevere area, which is an active and interesting neighborhood and is convenient to much of the rest of Rome (especially if you enjoy walking). Trastevere can be very loud at night; it is a popular area with a lot of bars and restaurants - the downside of this is that it can be loud - but this hotel is like a quiet oasis. - Some previous reviewers complained that the \"walls are thin\"- I did not find that too be the case. I am a light sleeper and I am easily bothered by noise but did not find this to be a problem even though the hotel was full. Maybe we were just lucky to have conscientious guest on either side of our room? - Our room was smallish, but I expect that in a dense European city. - The room was clean but was very dowdy. It looked like the furniture was new but it was very utilitarian and looked like something you would buy at a discount furniture store. I am not sure why they didn't spend a very small amount more to give the room some style. I am not too fussy about mattresses, but I don't think it was a very good one. I was expecting a bit more style and quality in a 200 Euro + room. - The courtyard of the hotel was very nice. - After eating out every night, we decided that we would pick up some food and wine at Volpetti and have it on one of the tables in the courtyard. When I asked for a corkscrew to open the wine, I was told that we were not permitted to eat our own food in the courtyard. We could order wine from their bar and have it in the courtyard but we could not have our own wine. I was miffed by that comment and asked why it had to be their food. The explanation is that it was a Roman law that did not allow them to have guests eat their own food on the hotel grounds. This was a huge disappointment -so we went out to east instead and had the food on the plane the next day. - They had bikes - I think they were complimentary, but maybe they rented them. They looked like good bikes (hybrid bikes i think but maybe they were mt. bikes) and appeared to be in very good condition. - What ever you do, DON'T DRIVE TO THIS HOTEL unless you are familiar with the streets around the hotel. If you are renting a car and Rome is your final destination, return your car somewhere outside of the center city and take a cab to the hotel ---- driving there was an absolute nightmare! - All of the staff was extremely friendly. There was one instance when one of the staff did not seem to take the extra effort to help us locate an address on a map - but other than that everyone was was extremely friendly. - The courtyard may seem cozy, but because all of the rooms are on the first floor, you have to remember to close your blinds unless you are an exhibitionist. In summary, I will not be going back because I know of other hotels which would suit me better for the money. I can understand why a lot of people like the hotel but I can't understand why so many people give it an \"Excellent\" rating based on its price. If the rate were 120 to 140 Euros, I think I could understand the rating.", "Date": "April 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice little place, but extremely overrated by this site\u201d", "Author": "aarnold78", "ReviewID": "UR3327657", "Content": "3-star accomodations.

We spent 4 nights each in Rome, London and Paris. We spent our 4 Roman days and nights at the Hotel Santa Maria in Trastevere. (As an aside, I have been to London and Paris before, but never to anywhere in Italy.) Though it definitely ended up as our favorite place of the 3, arriving in Roma is quite a shock to your system! It is much more \"foreign\" seeming than London or Paris. When we landed in Rome, a driver arranged by the hotel (not employed by them) was waiting to meet us in our terminal. However, no one was there. The streets of Trastevere are like a maze of alleys. And none were really very familiar with that area. Our driver had a large enough vehicle for all 4 of us and our bags, and we were off. Finding the hotel was quite an experience. Trastevere is a wonderful area! It is not touristy. It is more like how real Romans live. But, that being said, it is not laid out to make it easy for tourists to find their way around. (Use the map the hotel gives you once you check in.) Our cabbie drove up, down and around increasingly narrower streets (that looked like US alleys). He finally could get his cab just in the hotel. The hotel itself is small. I think there are only about 20 rooms. You enter a gate off the street, and walk into a courtyard area. All rooms open into this courtyard. Umbrella-covered tables are scattered around the courtyard, making for a wonderful outdoor breaking dining area. Buildings that adjoin the hotel make you realize you are NOT in a resort...you are in a regular Roman neighborhood, as balconies that display laundry, bicycles and such are there in view. We rented the Sr. Suite, which is the largest room they have. It has a king bed downstairs, and 2 twins upstairs in a little loft area. Like most of Rome, the floor is tile. The furnishings were very simple but adequate, the bedspread plain, the tv small (13\"?). But somehow, none of that mattered and only served to convey a more realistic feeling of where you were and what you were experiencing. The room did have a safe, air conditioning/heating.The bathroom had a large marble sink, different than I've seen before. It was large/wide, but very shallow. The hand towels were not terry cloth, but more like the kind you'd use to dry dishes with in the US. Not really a problem, just kinda weird. The bathroom was decent size, not huge, not tiny. It did have a bidet, and combined shower/tub. I had read that hot water is sometimes a luxury in Rome, but not in this hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful and had recommended the Roman Promenades tour company. We ended up taking 2 days of private tours in Rome a night tour and a tour of Pompeii. This suggestion MADE our trip! These tour guides were so excellent and helped us to see so much more than we ever would have on our own. (I will do a review of that company in the future.) You absolutely MUST have private tours if you are in Rome for the first time! The breakfast is served in a room off of the courtyard. The \"procedure\" is that you take a tray, load it up with whatever you want, bring it up to the front counter, tell them what kind of coffee you want, and leave it there while you go find a seat. They will then carry it out to you. (The room is down a few stairs, so this is very helpful.) The breakfast has a lot of different kind of pastry items, cereal, strawberries, meat and cheeses, and juices. Some of the pastry items were really more like cookies. (I obviously decided to NOT do a low carb diet while traveling. It just would not be possible to do and still enjoy the trip and experience everything fully.) My absolute favorite was what I call the nutballs. They seem to be made of just chopped nuts, sugar and cinnamon, and then rolled into a ball and baked....crunchy, sweet and deliciously moist inside! Our days in Rome were not spent around our room. We would get up, enjoy the breakfast, meet our tour guide and be out until around 4pm. By then, things are kind of quiet everywhere anyway, so we'd take a little rest in the room, and then go out for dinner around 7 or 8. When I heard that dinner is usually not eaten until 8, I didn't know how I'd ever be able to wait that late. But once there, it is easy to fall into the location habits, and we grew to love the 8-10pm dinners, lingering over the pasta, wine, coffee and gelato. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the Santa Maria Trastevere square, which has a number of restaurants, and it is so fun to watch in the evening as it fills up with people and activity. There are probably 50 or more restaurants within a 5 minute walk, so just pick a place, sit outside, enjoy the food and people watch! It was a let down to get back to the American way of eating dinner when we returned! A note about the neighborhood....it doesn't look like a pristine, tourist resort area. It has graffiti, trash, and people, dogs and vehicles/scooters racing through it. (Of course, so does most of Rome!) But it never felt unsafe, so don't let what some books say scare you away. (Just be mindful and smart about things.) You will have a much more authentic experience being immersed in this area. (It is across the Tiber river from the Trevi fountain, the Piazza Navona, the Spanish steps, and the Pantheon, but all those can be walked to. You just need to plan on walking while in Rome!) Our leaving was easier than arriving....our driver for our Pompeii tour picked us up and we were on our way.

We arrived to the hotel at 9:30am and the first thing they did was show us to breakfast while they were finishing up our room. Breakfast was great: eggs, meats, cheeses, cereals and pastries. The best part were the free and excellent Cappuccinos. After breakfast, we were allowed to check-in at 10:30, a great feature. I had ordered flowers through the hotel which were absolutely gorgeous and the HSM threw in a bottle of Champange for free - again great service. The room was small but very neat and clean with a KS bed. Full featured bathroom, again very clean.

Great location for walking to all of the main areas of the centre as it allows different routes to be taken each time. The area was busy when we visited over the new year, but it felt more \"local\" than most of the other parts of Rome and more genuine than some of the more heavily touristed areas. The hotel areas were very well presented, the courtyard delightful showing off that it is a converted monastry (but probably more useful in the summer!), the service was good, and breakfast well presented. Having said that I can see why the hotel could get so more varied reviews (which seems to happen with most of the hotels on Trip Advisor!) since it depends what the visitor is looking for and whether the hotel fits what they want. If you are looking for the type of things that I describe above then I would fully recommend the hotel. The hotel is fairly small scale (20 rooms) so you do not get the amenities that you would get at more mainstream chain hotels, it could appear to be noiser if you prefer a sound proof room rather than hearing the church bells ring out, and the room sizes were not particularly large.

I wouldn't say it was luxurious but has everything you need including king size beds, decent sized rooms (by European standards) which are spotlessly clean and have a mini bar fridge for storing all that unmissable food from the local delis and supermarket (once you've unpacked the fridge) and bought your own drinks locally for half the price. The rooms are very quaint with large oak beams and terracotta tiled floors. It certainly isn't a cheap place to stay but well worth the money in low season. The price is fairly steep in high season. You get what you pay for in Europe however. The hotel is perfect if you don't want to be jammed into the central tourist zone. It isn't the quietist location (low level disturbances such as church bells, seagulls, cats, next door's plumbing) but all the walking induces many a good sleep.

The taxi service offered by the hotel is somewhat expensive for couples. We got to the hotel by mini van from Ciampino for 25 euros for 2 with Minivan Service to Roma who were touting for business at the airport. It pays to haggle over the price.

After 90 minutes of waiting, we arranged another ride to your hotel. When we got there (after 24 hours of travel), and without a greeting, the front office angrily demanded 50 Euro because we did not wait at the airport longer. After a lengthy \"welcome to Rome\" argument, she called the shuttle service and worked out a solution (by telling them incorrectly we wanted to find another way). 2) That night, after showering from 24 hours of travel, we used both of the shampoo samples you provided. We asked the front desk if we could get another and were told, \"NO. We used your allotment already.\" Amazing... 3) On our 5th night, at a time later than midnight, there was a rather loud party in the courtyard. We called the front desk to see if the party could be made a little quieter. The desk person, who understood English every other time we spoke, decided then he couldn't understand English and asked me to call back in the morning. Obviously he was just being lazy or rude (both). Overall, extremely disappointing front desk service.

The place reeks of atmosphere and through eyes accustomerd to all that's modern, it almost seems staged. However, as your vision clears, you realize this is ancient, authentic, and very charming Rome. The hotel is a walled oasis in the midst of a bustling, rambling warren of narrow streets with laundry stretched above, old peolple watching the world go by from behind flowering window boxes, and cats lounging in every nook or cranny. The hotel has a lovely courtyard where you can take breakfast or relax with a bottle of wine. The only sound that passes from outside is the gentle, soothing striking of church bells marking the quarter hour, or the occassion cat fight among the various tom cats that patrol the neighborhood. The neighborhood around the hotel is best at night. It rocks every night, but in a typically Roman, laid-back way. Although we only stayed a week in October, I imagine you can stay for months and eat at a different restaurant every night. Wanderig through the narrow, winding streets trying to scope out the most inviting trattoria has got to be one of the top pleasures of life. It's easy to get lost here, but it's hard to go too far astray as you'll eventually get led back to where you started...and discover so much along the way. The nearby church, Santa Maria in Trastevere, is the oldest Christian church in Rome and has mosaics that will take your breath away. The piazza outside is lined with restaurants, cafes, shops, and has a great fountain. You can have your palm read by a Hungarian fortune teller or buy an original work of art from a local artist, or listen to the wandering musicians that will entertain you late into the night.

The hotel staff were professional and attentive. We did not experience any difficulty with any of the staff. As someone else mentioned, the real highlight is the courtyard under the orange trees. Trastevere is an ecclectic mix of people. The real disappoint throughout the major cities in Italy is the graffitti on everything! So when you first arrive in Trastevere, you don't really know what to think of the area. It was a very safe area, however. The food was delicious--better and more cost effective than across the River. Our favorite restaurant was La Scala.

This was nothing to do with the location or the hotel its self, it was the attitude of the receptionist. We had been travelling since 5am (we arrived at about 4.15 pm!) and were absolutely exhausted. When we entered the reception the woman behind the desk was on the phone, not saying anything, just sat silently holding the receiver. She completely ignored us. We waited patiently, finally about five minutes later she glanced up and said I am calling someone a taxi ,and then continued ignoring us for even longer. We were not impressed and felt offended. Eventually she showed us to our room, at no time did she say welcome to the Hotel Santa Maria. This was such a shame because I booked this special anniversary weekend back in January and had been dreaming about it ever since.It was the first chance of special time together as husband and wife without our daughters for a long time! The room was very clean and the shower and bath were fine. We did find it rather noisy when other people were using their showers and baths ,or even talking ,because the walls between the rooms are thin.It may be just be a personal preference, but I did find the pillows very hard as they were the solid foam type.The maid tried hard to find me a softer one which I very much appreciated. The next day was better, there was a much nicer receptionist (I can only identify her by saying she had a little wound on her face)this receptionist was warm and friendly as was the young lady working in the bar and it made such a difference. The breakfasts were indeed delicious with plenty of choice and it was pleasant to sit in the scrupulously clean courtyard after a long day walking. We loved the Trastavere district which had a wonderful atmosphere, there were plenty of places to eat.The beautiful church of Santa Maria is not to be missed, the bells sounded wonderful and the interior is incredible. We walked everywhere, its about 25 minutes to the Vatican City in one direction and about 20 or so to the coliseum in the other. Thr Trevi fountain was slightly disappointing because of the crowds and crowds of people, so dont imagine it will be like the scene from Roman Holiday!

The other staff were very courteous and most seemed to speak a little English. The room was huge and had 1-1/2 bathrooms. The shower curtain in the bathroom leaked a bit but not a real problem. The courtyard was the epitome of serenity and the perfect setting for breakfast. Although the breakfast was listed as continental we also got eggs, and ham and other cold cuts. Trastavere is a quaint neighborhood and had a more local feel than some of the other areas we visited. We walked most everywhere but generally took cabs back in the evenings as the walking and the sun tired us out by the end of the day. (A word of advice-cabs don't seem to like to go into Trastavere because of its narrow streets. We found it easier to have the cabs drop you off at Ponte Sisto and its a 5 minute walk to the hotel from there.) All in all I was quite impressed and satisfied with Hotel Santa Maria and would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "September 24, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santiago-Chile", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2586496", "Content": "We had a very nice stay at the Hotel.
