Check in: We arrived fairly late (after 9pm) and check in was quick and painless. The staff were friendly and gave good directions to our room (the resort is big and it took a while to find reception). The room: We stayed in a 2 Queen View Suite, one of the nicest categories as I understand. The suite was spacious, with a large living area and good sized bedroom. It was quite dated but clean. The water pressure in the shower was bad.The view was nice but not spectacular. The food: We ordered room service when we arrived which came quickly. The food was average/good but was pricey for what it was. We had breakfast at the Pointe in Thyme Grill the next day. Our waitress was lovely and very attentive but some of the other staff were less so. The man at the omelette station was positively grumpy, and I heard him complaining to another guest that he used to do night shifts and they had switched him to the morning, when he wasn't a \"morning person\". I am not used to encountering sullen staff in the US, but maybe he was just having a bad day. Spa: We had arranged spa treatments for the mornings and went over early in the hope of relaxing by the pool for half an hour beforehand. We had put on our swimsuits and asked for a robe to wear. We were told that robes were only available for guests having more than one treatment. After asking whether we could pay to \"hire\" one, we were begrudgingly given some. We then went to the pool but found the jacuzzi to be out of order. We asked the lady at the spa to point us towards the other nearby jacuzzi but were told to just sit and wait as she'd already told the ladies doing our treatments where we would be. The treatment itself (their signature massage) was pretty average and extremely expensive. I would not rebook. Summary: I don't think I would stay here again. The room served our purposes but was in need of updating. The spa was not the relaxing experience it should have been and the food was overpriced in my opinion.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cFamily-friendly and relaxing\u201d", "Author": "fivefromco", "ReviewID": "UR127951508", "Content": "We were drawn to this resort because it was more affordable than similar family resorts in the area.

The wait staff in the Falls pool area was just that - we had to wait on ourselves and when we did finally order food, the guy came without our food asking if there was something we wanted to order. The workout room was in a separate area of the property than the other amenities, so not appealing. There wasn't a vending machine in our building so we went to two machines near the adult pool area and they didn't work. Ended up buying a beverage in the gift shop for $1 more than the vending machine price. A bird squawked above our room from 6:00am-6:30am daily and an abandoned housekeeping cart sat next to our building throughout the day.

We had stayed at this property 10 years ago and it is much larger than I remember. The hotel is built into the mountainside so it is very hilly and spread out. This time we had a room about as far from The Falls pool area as you could get. We took the complimentary shuttle from outside our building to the pool and back. You can call from your room or the call boxes located at each stop. It is pretty efficient and comes within 5 or 10 minutes of calling. The rooms are along the lines of Embassy Suites, with separate living room that has a sofa bed. Our sofa bed was pretty new and had a memory foam mattress rather than the old spring style pull out beds. Another nice feature in the room was the fact that the sink was separate from the shower area. Very helpful when you have a teen age daughter traveling with you. Our biggest complaint had to do with housekeeping. It seemed to be hit or miss. One day we went to the pool around 10:30 and came back to a dirty room at 2:30. After we showered , we called housekeeping to get the room cleaned. When we arrived home that night, a very basic cleaning had been done. They left the room with very little toilet paper (we ran out by morning in fact), they took the sheet from the sofa bed and didn't leave a new one, and we had no tissues. They also did not clean the floor during our stay. There was a small leaf on the bathroom floor that remained for the five nights. I could have picked it up, but I used it as a test to see if they vacuumed. The small leaf remained. We only had breakfast once and it was very good. The wait staff was efficient and courteous. Front desk staff was also pleasant. Workout room was fine. There were several treadmills and elliptical machines each with their own t.v. and there were headphones to use if you forget our own. Overal, property is fine. The problem is that there are so many great resorts in the Phoenix area and this one is nice, but not great. The parking can be limited depending on occupancy and where your building is located. If you aren't much for climbing very steep stairs or roads to get to your room, request one in the lower section when making your reservation.

For our first leg of the trip, we were in the family pool section of the main building. On the return leg of our trip, we were in the adult pool section of the main building. Our Family pool room was on the fourth (top) floor on the side nearest to 7th St. The balcony faced 7th St. You can sit on the balcony (2 chairs and small table). However, there is constant traffic noise from the road, which is quite busy, so keeping your screen door open in cooler weather can be a problem for noise in the morning. The front of the room opens to an interior walkway that overlooks a patio area and the fenced off family pool area. Our Adult pool room was on the fifth (top) floor with the balcony overlooking the cliffs behind the resort. No road traffic noise, but fairly consistent noise from the gas-powered golf carts employees use to get around. The view facing into the resort was much nicer than the view racing the road. Both rooms were identical in layout. The door opens to a small living room with good-sized flat-screen TV, a full-size couch bed, a small writing desk and chair, and a sitting chair. There is also an honor bar that actually had room for some of our own stuff. The short hallway to the bedroom provides the access to the split bathroom, with the toilet and bath on one side (own separate door) and the sink/vanity on the other side of the short hallway. There are two sets of hallway doors \u2013 one as you enter the hallway from the living room, and another door to the bedroom. The bath area is large. Our bedroom had two very comfortable queen beds. The wall opposite to the bed has a bench built in, which worked well as a luggage rack, a smaller flat screen TV & dresser in an alcove, and a built in closet with a regular luggage rack. There is no safe in the room. The balcony is accessed by a sliding glass door and locking screen door from the bedroom. Lighting throughout the room was good, and the beds had reading lamps on the sides away from a center lamp. The room was very clean and well kept. We visited the Falls pool complex only once. We rented a cabana for $75 for the very first day since our room was not ready (we arrived at 11 AM) and the Cabana provided a place to change and call home and get out of the sun. We spent most of our time at the Family pool, as it was closer to our room, less crowded, and a tad bit warmer than the Falls pools. The family pool is salt-water, which I really appreciate as it doesn\u2019t burn the eyes. The hot tub pool is adjacent and is good and hot. The family pool also has padded lounge chairs. Some guests are real slobs \u2013 leaving their used towels on chairs and empty plastic drink cups at tables when they leave, which makes it confusing to determine what chairs/tables are available for use. We checked out some of the other pools in the hillside sections \u2013 they are much smaller that the main building and Falls pools. Used room service and the restaurants several times. Fair prices. Room service pizza is good and not overpriced. About a mile north is a shopping area with restaurants, drug store, grocery stores etc. \u2013 but you need to drive to it. Good coffee in the lobby, along with tea, cereal, pastries and fruit. Great gift shop. The architecture and layout of the main building and of the resort is fascinating. It is fun to walk around and explore. Parking is tough \u2013 although there are parking lots all over, many of the stalls are very narrow. Our rental car company \u201cupgraded\u201d us to a too large sedan and we ended up getting a door scratch from a neighboring car. The parking areas closer to 7th street are much less crowded and have more space. My one complaint is with their early check-in process. I tried calling a day ahead and was told by the operator that we would have to go to the front desk to request early check in, give them a cell phone #, and could use the pool while we waited. So we arrived at 11 AM, gave them our # and headed off to the pool. At about 3:30 we still had not been called so I went to the front desk and they told me my room was not yet ready. I had to ask if another room was ready, and they said sure and got me right in. Not sure why when guests are waiting for a room, they stick with waiting for a pre-assigned room instead of offering them a vacant room. Almost all of the rooms are identical. Odd. If we happen to be in Phoenix again, I would not hesitate to stay at Tapatio, though I might try to get way up the hill for a change of pace, and also spring for the executive suite since the Hilton \u201cbook an upgrade at reduced rates if they are available \u2013 you will find out at check-in\u201d gimmick has never worked for me.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cvery nice place\u201d", "Author": "caroljoyj", "ReviewID": "UR127301930", "Content": "This was a very nice hotel, well appointed, clean.

Activities at the resort are varied for all: tennis or golf are excellent, as well as a great variety of hiking trails which start right at the resort. But to be honest, your best bet is to hang out at the resort: daytime lounging at the many pools, and evenings enjoying the views with a bottle of wine and cheese on your private balcony. When you drive to the resort approach it from the north: off Thunderbird Road, even if your Garmin advises an earlier exit off Highway 51. The trip will be easier and more scenic, as the neighborhoods south of the resort are not unsafe, but are full of empty storefronts, etc. Enjoy this resort: it is as good as any of the best in the metro area.

There is a spa, but there was no spa information in my room, so I had to ask at the front desk. By the time I tried to get an appointment (once I had seen the services), the spa was closed. Got cozy in my PJs and wanted to watch a movie. Turned on the TV and couldn't find any movies, so I called the front desk. Was told that when they \"upgraded\" to the flat screen TVS (what hotel these days doesn't have flat screen TVS?), they didn't \"turn on\" the \"On Demand.\" So my option was to go to the front desk and rent a DVD player. I could get my head around putting my clothes back on and doing that, but then I was told that the nearest movie place was \"Red Box\" (or something) and that it was not within walking distance of the hotel. Awesome. There goes my relaxing night. Not to be thwarted from my plans, I thought, \"I will watch a movie on my computer, even though the screen is tiny!\" So I tried to log on to wireless from the bedroom. As with what had happened earlier in the day, the wireless showed as \"connected\" but I could not access the Internet. So I called Tech Support. After 10 minutes of troubleshooting, he confirmed that I am indeed \"connected\" but that whatever I am \"connected\" to, wasn't connecting out. So he would need to call \"the location\" and have them address it. As promised, Maintenance showed up within 10 minutes (score for being prompt).

This place was an engineering challenge and it's maintenance issues are reflective of that challenge. If you stay here, you'll understand why. The Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort is another very good Hilton property, but has an identity crisis. The rooms in the main hotel are up to date and quite nice, yet the rooms in the suites and outlying structures are quite dated and unkept, so beware if you make a reservation for a suite because you may be greatly disappointed. The resort itself is built into the side of a cliff, with the hotel at the base and the surrounding buildings (where the suites are located) built above it. This makes traversing the resort very challenging because all the activities are adjacent to the main hotel building. There are shuttles that will move guests between locations, but I found these to be very unreliable (it would sometimes take 30 minutes for them to arrive to pick us up). The parking was also an issue because in many cases you had to navigate and park on very steep hills and this is not easy to do, especially at night. For food and beverages, the resort offers several different options to choose from. The one 'must-see' in this resort is the Different Pointe of View restaurant located at the highest part of the property. From here you will enjoy a breathtaking view of the Phoenix valley while enjoying a good meal and cocktails with friends or colleagues. The grounds were clean but maintenance was an issue for simple things like handrails, elevators and signage-perhaps an indicator of how hard this hotel has been hit by the recession. The rooms (we had a suite) also showed signs of cheap repairs in that old, beat up wood work was simply painted over vs. replaced and this a disappointment. The staff of this hotel was it's saving grace for sure. They were pleasant and helpful despite any concerns I presented and provided assistance in any way they could.

However, we noticed there was not one other car parked anywhere near the building where we were directed. This was ok by me as it made for easier parking. The suite was very very large. Nice \"living room,\" nice bedroom, a bath suite at the end of the bedroom, a separate half bath off the living room \"Kitchenette\" area. BEWARE of the \"Kitchenette.\" It is actually merely a wet bar with a full refrigerator of insanely high priced snacks and drinks. We found an information sheet about the \"resort.\" For an additional $25, they will remove the stuff from your refrigerator. Also included in the information sheet was the ability to spend an additional $2.75 per day for access to the gym and a few other things that I would think would be included at the over $230 per night price. The suite was strange. It had been renovated as it had granite counters and flat panel TVs, and probably new furniture. (I personally found only the desk chair really comfortable...but I have a bad back and am fussy about chairs.) However, there were two thermostats on the wall and we could not figure out what they were for. As this was early February in Phoenix, we did not have to make too much use of the heating system, so we did NOT bother to ask for assistance. The bathroom fixtures had not been recently renovated. Driving up to the top of the hill, where there was a restaurant (which I believe we were told at check-in we needed to make reservations for if we wanted to eat there) and a parking lot. The view into the valley from this parking lot was ever bit as spectacular as the view one gets after hiking up (or walking up the road) at North Mountain. Simply wonderful. As we drove around the resort we seemed to think there is a main central building, and the various buildings up the hill. The \"main\" building appeared to be newer than the buildings up the hill. Perhaps if one is familiar with resorts, or plays gulf, this place may be more appreciated. Another strangeness: wifi was available in the lobby, but one had to pay $10 per day for wired wifi in the suite. For the view, and access to the Phoenix Mountain Parks (hiking trails), this place is great. Perhaps if you know somebody familiar with this place it might be great. As a member of Hilton's loyalty program, I am terribly disappointed in this property. If you can obtain a great rate, it may be worth staying at.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edina, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cYes, cliffside rooms.

The rooms are suite style and were clean and pleasant with a mini fridge. The furnishings were nothing special but the bed was very comfortable and pristine in white linens.

Excellent, friendly table service and nicely displayed buffet items which were of restaurant quality for the most part. The dinner menu at Pointe of Tyme did not disappoint either nor the service. The BEST part about the Tapatio is that there are hiking trails all over, with the North Mountain park just across the street by underpass. A very nice visitor center awaits with trail information and exhibits. A person can also hike up the slope from the top of the hotel property, or through the lowlands adjacent.

Did I like it? Yes. Parking was free, and accept one night when there was a function going on, very easy to come by. The area around the parking etc. is a bit steep, I was walking with a cane, and as long as I went slowly, I did fine. Check-in was very easy and quick. The problem I could see with check-in is with your car outside, the entrance way is a u-turn coming in, and the lanes are a bit narrow, so with a bigger car it takes a bit of maneuvering. Plus, coming in and going out from the hotel on 7th Street is a bit tricky because of the curves. The decorations were very nice. Especially the palm trees right outside from the lobby entrance. Our suitcases were taken out of the car and a very nice bell hop/attendant assisted me to the room with the cases. The service and the people were very wonderful. Here I was very impressed. Because we booked thru AARP, we received breakfast coupons. The restaurant was gorgeous, and the food was really yummy. I was impressed. We also ate here on Tuesday night, and the salmon was out of this world, and I ended up ordering it again thru room service. Service was excellent. Now to my but\u2026I stayed here for 4/nts. I loved the bed. One of the most comfortable beds ever. I loved the TV\u2019s . Yup, 2 of them. The bathroom/sink area was a bit strange. The toilet/bathtub/shower was to the right, and the one single sink area to the left. It was nice, but I felt it was somewhat inconvenient. There was a living room area, with a fold out couch. My son slept on this the first night and was very uncomfortable, plus, you could not sit upright on this couch because it was so slick, you slid down every time. The shower was fine, but the shower curtain was too short and water ran into the hallway area, so I was mopping it up with towels so we wouldn\u2019t slip. On my arrival, I immediately had to use the restroom, and I found a black hair on the toilet. There was also a dip in the floor and the ceiling looked like it had had a leak or something, plus, it looked like the popcorn ceiling was in the process of being scrapped off. The heater/AC thumped loudly when it turned off. Very annoying. My husband used the hiking path behind the hotel in the preserve area, but found the path somewhat rocky and more suitable for a hike then a jog. The grounds were beautiful with fountains, and the pools were very nice. I didn\u2019t use the heated pool because the weather was a bit cold this time of year.

The rooms were nice, and spacious. We stayed in a suite in the main building and really liked the central location to all the amenities. The resort charged an optional $2.25 per guest to use the amenities such as tennis court and fitness room. I thought this was an incredibly reasonable value. The fitness center was nice, but it seemed a bit small for the size of the resort. The in room coffee was delicious and all in all the rooms were a very nice value for the hotel price. Staff was incredibly friendly and helfpul and I slept like a baby in the black-out curtained rooms! My one complaine is that the location of the resort is a little off the beaten path if you are planning on hanging out in Scottsdale or visiting the busier parts of the city. It took us about 15-20 minutes driving out of the way to go do anything. The resort is perfect if you plan on staying, playing golf, or hiking around the area. Otherwise, I might suggest finding something a little more central. Unfortunatley it rained a few days of our stay so we weren't able to check out the pool either.

On the first night we discovered the sofa bed did not have a sheet, the two lights on bed were burnt out, and the phone buttons did not work so we could not call the front desk . We also only had 3 towels for four people. Since we were so tired, we made due for the night with one blanket so our kids could go to sleep. The next day we went to the office and put in a request to have everything repaired and for extra towels and a sheet. We ended up getting the linens from the maid as we were going back to the room. We went out for the day and found that the lights were not replaced when we returned that night. The next morning as we were getting ready for the day our coffee pot quit working too. When we went down to ask to have the lights replaced again and report the coffee make not working the desk clerk looked at us and said \"were you making two cups because I heard they can over heat?\". She did not even offer an apology and the coffee make is made to make two cups. I wanted to say, \"really, your are telling me that this is acceptable and it is my fault for using it as intended\", but I stated only the fact that we had made two cups about 15 min. apart. She put in the repair orders without apology or acknowledging my statement that the lights had already been requested to be replaced the day before. We went out for the day and came back to a new coffee maker and working lights, but only three towels. Frustrated, we went down do the office on our way out to dinner and request more. Two hours later when we returned, we still did not have towels so we called down and asked again for towels. They were brought up in about 15 min. I noticed that my sinuses bothered me a lot after our first night. On our last day I figured out why, the air filter in the ceiling was completely caked with dust. I also noticed that the whole outer rim of carpet next to the base board was caked with dust. I was sickened, I couldn't leave quick enough. Lack of attention to maintenance and other details seem to be a common theme at Tapatio. Aside from our issues, we walked past the same two glasses in an ashtray for three days straight....who knows, they could still be there. My last complaints are that the design of the building is very low and heights are unmarked at entrance ways. When it was late at night the lighting is dark it is hard to see. My husband hit his head on the building leaving a huge bump. There should be a reflective strip placed inside the structure as you walk out towards the parking lot. Lastly, when paying for what it supposed to be a more upscale hotel, I prefer not to see employees drinking beer in the parking lot.

Our window overlooked the parking lot, but the walkways in front of the rooms overlook one of the pool areas. Prices for snacks at the lobby cafe were expensive.

I live in the south valley, and had to spend the day in the north valley, so my husband and I thought it would be nice to get dinner and stay overnight. We went to A Different Pointe of View, and I have to say it was exceptional. I wrote a separate review for the restaurant. Overall, dinner was excellent and I would definitely go back. I cannot say the same for the hotel. Before describing the problems I encountered, I will state that almost every employee was very nice, helpful, smiling and generally welcoming. I have nothing but the highest praise for the shuttle drivers who were prompt, entertaining and super nice both times we called them. The furnishings and decor in the room were comfortable and clean, but I would say the room itself was a 3 star at most (for a 4 star price, of course). I checked in at about 3PM and quickly left to attend a function. We returned to the room after dinner, at about midnight. It was extremely hot in the room. I live in Arizona, so I do not use the term \"extremely hot\" lightly. It had to have been almost 100 degrees. I couldn't say for sure, however, because the air conditioner unit was showing 75, which is how I presume it was last set. I cranked it down to 68, then we collapsed into bed. At 2AM, I awoke drenched in sweat. I got up to check the air conditioner, and it still said 68 but it was definitely NOT 68 in the room. I set it to fan-high instead of auto and tried to go back to sleep. After tossing and turning, awake, for about another half an hour, I got up again and checked the vent. I found the air was blowing - HOT. There was hot air... HOT AIR... blowing out of the vents when I set it to 68. There was no hot/cold function, just a temperature setting. I was so unbelievably tired I just turned the unit off and decided to open the window. Unfortunately, the windows at the front of the room don't open at all. The only window to open was to the balcony. Since no other windows would open, it took a while to get cool air into the room. Finally, around 3:15 I was able to get back to sleep (without any sheets or blankets, I might add). Luckily, we were right near the entrance to the resort, so every few minutes cars would drive by, or drunken guests would stumble about, or in general some very loud outside noise would rouse me. There was a brief respite between about 4:30 and 6:30, in which I almost got good sleep. Almost. Then the groundskeepers started their work, and I gave up even trying. I left the bedroom and went to make myself a cup of coffee. I added the creamers they provided, and wouldn't you know it, they were spoiled. A hundred little chunks of what should have been liquid creamer floated to the top of my coffee. Thanks, Hilton. No longer trusting anything in the room, I had to drive myself to the Starbucks on the corner. In discussing this with my husband, I decided I wanted to check out personally so I could let the front desk know about the a/c and hopefully get some sort of remediation. Or at the very least, an apology. No such luck. The petite blonde at the counter had a smile pasted to her face the whole time, but never once said the word \"sorry\" or \"apologize.\" What she did say was that maintenance is available 24 hours. I attempted to explain to her that at 3AM when I am dead tired, I did not want to wait up for the maintenance man and then endure his repairs and lose the entire night of sleep, nor did I want to have to get up, pack all of my things again and move. She gave me \"the look\" and repeated maintenance is available 24 hours. I pointed out to her that unless they haven't rented that room in the past month, they had to have been aware of the air conditioner issue, so why would they stick us in there? She repeated that maintenance is available 24 hours. She was not only frustrating, she was condescending and rude, and if I had the time I would have waited to speak to the manager. Since I didn't, I've decided to write this review. Maybe they will see it and try to correct their issues. I realize that, had we been given any other room, I probably would have been very satisfied with my stay there. The way I see it, however, is that they take lackadaisical care of their property, renting rooms to people when they clearly must have known they were subpar, and then showed no interest in customer service or ensuring repeat business when the problems were brought to their attention. To imply my sleepless night was my own fault becuase I was too tired to spend the night with their maintenance team is beyond the pale. I will never stay at another Hilton, I will stick to Marriott from now on. I will also ensure I detail this encounter to everyone one I know.

I was the MOH. The rehearsal was set for 5:30 at the \"falls\" which is their poolside venue. The bride had already checked into a \"presidential suite\" and was told she could get a ride anywhere on the property (this is a very large resort, it is spread out and built on the side of a mountain). The bride wasn't picked up as promised so she had to drive herself and we ran a tad bit late. The falls is a nice location off the main pools that say they closes at 5. The falls are basically a big waterfall with a flat area in front of it. The \"falls\" are pretty loud so you really need a mike to hear anything( not an issue just a bit of advise for any future brides). All went fine and the group headed to a local restaurant for the rehearsal dinner. We headed to check in at the front desk. We were greeted by the most proficient person I came across at the resort, Tyler. He was fast and courtesy and has the skills that most Hilton Hotels are known for. I asked how close we were to the bridal suite as I am the maid of honor. We were two buildings over which is quite a hike. Tyler did explain to me the resort was full due to a convention and several weddings so he would not be able to accommodate a request to move us closer. We checked out our room (a two room std suite) it was clean and you could tell that it had received some upgrades over the last few years and we had a very nice view from the little balcony looking north to all the evening lights. It had all the standards items (shampoo, conditioner and bar soap). The mini fridge was locked so unless you cut into it and then paid the service fee you couldn't use the fridge. All of the offerings are WAY overpriced. We went to the store bought a cheap styrofoam cooler and water and soda for our stay. No way will I pay 4.50 for a can of soda. No complimentary water either. My family stayed the night in our room and I stayed with the bride in her \"presidential suite\". Okay, so I have no idea what president would stay here because it was just a bigger room with a fireplace and a wet bar and a dining room table. Nothing special and not worth the extra money. I have been fortunate enough to travel in my lifetime and I have stayed at more than my fair share of nice places. I don't consider myself a \"travel-snob\". I like nice and clean and good value and service. I don't expect to have the staff \"kiss my @%%\" But, I do expect fast courtesy service and friendly personnel. I didn't see that happening here. Especially didn't see it happening for my friend the bride. I would have thought that the \"wedding/planner or coordinator\" person would have been a bit more professional, friendly and on the ball. The bride had to call her in the morning as she hadn't heard from her. The bride had me call the florist to find out \"where the flowers were\". The bride gave my teenage sons cell phone number as a contact person as he is very organized and would be a helper for the bride. At 4:00 my son grabs me and says the \"Hilton wedding person\" called and was asking where the cake was! She needed to know who was bringing it! I know for a fact the bride had given her the contact information. The coordinator told the bride she wouldn't be on property till 4:00pm and this was a 5:30 Wedding. At 4:30 some member of staff came to the room to grab the table favors, ceremony items and reception items. At 5:00pm a driver came in a van to get the bride, her ring bearer, flower girl and myself. We were at the falls at 5:05 and the pool was super active and things weren't totally set up. Again, this was a 5:30 wedding. The bride was very upset as she walked by and saw what was going on and was taken to a cabana nearby that had too much patio furniture shoved in it and was to wait their till the time. She was given a bottle of cold water. The bridal party including the groom was rushing around getting things set up. I put the pew bows on the chairs and set up the family photos on the table. The groom and the minister set up the sand ceremony items... it was a scramble and a joke! We started the wedding promptly at 5:30 and the bride looking lovely make her way pass the group of 5 drunk guys who were having fun still hanging by the suppose to be closed pool. I saw nothing less than 25 people just sort of hanging around. Curious on lookers and the like. The wedding was nice and the bride and groom exchanged vows. Then the wedding party went to the same cabana to wait for everyone else to head down to the reception area.... still an outdoor area adjacent to the main pool. I met Susan (I believe) and Tami one of the catering staff. They seemed to have it a bit more together. They were still setting up the area while the wedding was going on and my son had to show them exactly were things went. The appetizer were good. The bartender was fast and pleasant and made a wonderful margarita. The dinner was served on time and everything tasted good. Nothing special just good. The bride seemed to calm down as things started going and all went fine from there. We left at about 10:00pm and drove our car back up the hill to our room. Again, the parking here is a HUGE issue and the streets are small and curvy and dark. Lots of incline walking so if you have leg or hip issues or are an older person I would make sure you request a room off the main lobby as this will not be comfortable for you. We were a little hungry so we decided to order some room service. After having to make several attempts we got through. We order two burgers, a bowl of chowder and a dish of ice-cream. We got a call back after our order to say \"what kind of fries did we want\"? But when my husband asked what kind do you have he was told french fries?... yeah I'm not sure what that was all about but, surprise the food arrived Hot, and good... actually better than what was served at the wedding IMHO. It was a whopping 60.00 though! I think that is more than what the bride and groom paid..(45.00) a person I believe. I would say if you are looking for a hotel in the area its fine. The hotel says are a 4 star property....yeah, I am not sure. If you are a bride looking to have a wedding here... I would advise you to hire a professional wedding planner for the day to be their to handle the details. No bride needs to be freaking out over where things are! The resort it self is a little old and you can see it in certain things. for the most part it is maintained and if you liked to hike or horseback ride this could make it for you. I am an Arizona native and in the 80's this was THE PLACE its just a shame that they didn't move with the times such as other Arizona landmarks that have, The Biltmore, The Phoenician and even the Valley Ho. All of which are wonderful choices the Biltmore and Phoenician are a bit more but I think the Valley Ho has been running some great specials. All in all my friend is married and happy. I WOULD NOT recommend this for any brides to be unless you are on a seriously tight budget and want a resort wedding.

We had a 2 queen-bed suite in Building 8, which is in the upper/hillside section of the hotel. The room was nice: not palatial, but more than enough room. LOTS of drawers and storage space, which was welcome. 2 TVs, one remote control. No pay-per-view movies, just regular cable channels. Honor bar but no fridge space, which would be nice but isn't a deal-breaker. Very, very clean room and bathroom. Separate sink/mirror area from bathroom. Shower/tub, both nice and again very clean. Water pressure a little on the weak side but adequate. The beds were super firm and comfortable. A full length mirror is provided in the bedroom area, which is rare and very welcome in a hotel room. Eight, count 'em, 8 swimming pools here. The \"Falls\" area is the most popular with families and tends to get crowded on weekends. Even though our room overlooked this pool, we didn't hear any noise, not even during the most crowded times. There's a much smaller, quieter pool up the hill that overlooks the whole complex and is nice and peaceful. There's also one \"adults only\" pool that is located in the back of the main/lobby building, and is closed off from the louder areas. The staff here is super friendly - not just polite, but genuinely friendly. We had a problem with people in a room near ours and the front desk people found instant, creative solutions to our problem, and knocked some money off our bill for our inconvenience, which was much appreciated. Hotel restaurant staff is similarly nice- after buffet breakfast, our waitress asked if I'd like a free iced tea to go because it was so hot outside! Due to the extreme heat (113 F) during our stay, we were encouraged to call for a shuttle to get us around the grounds, and they always showed up within 2 minutes and were cheerful about taking us to the restaurants and pools. One downside: the buildings in the section we were in face the hillside and the road to reach them is narrow- picture a twisty, tiny road in a small European village. Now picture it lined with American-sized cars, SUVs and pickup trucks. It's difficult to navigate and REALLY difficult to park- you have to parallel park on a curved, narrow, dead-end road where there is no place to turn around. If you're in Building 7 or 8, you have to back down that narrow, curvy road to a driveway that turns into the downhill parking lot. If my 72 year old mother hadn't been with me I'd have parked in a more distant lot and just hiked up the hill, but due to the extreme heat and her age, we needed the car nearby. I parked in front of the room for two days, then in the downhill lot and brought the car back and forth through that road. (If I were the owners of this hotel I'd take out the parking spaces and make that section \"bell service and shuttle-to-room only.\") So parking was a hassle, but everything else was so nice I'd go back in a heartbeat.

Something that was kind of annoying to us was the location of the refrigerator. It was inside a cabinet and catty corner to a dresser in the sitting room, and was very difficult to access. To make things more complicated, the door opened up towards you instead of away from you, so you had to hang over the door and lean over it to reach your arm inside to get something. Another thing that we had an issue with was parking. There just isn't enough, period. If you are lucky enough to get a spot even remotely close to your room, don't move your vehicle!

On my first night here I had to have the fridge replaced in my room because it had quit cooling. Luckily, the engineering staff was very quick and kind and remembered me from the first time I stayed and had a faulty TV remote. This resort is pretty to look at and nice for a weekend stay. If you don\u2019t mind driving and have no issue eating the same food over and over, this resort may be perfect for you. I would not recommend for longer than a week or on a trip where it is imperative to do business from your hotel room.

We're from Flagstaff and just wanted to get away for the weekend. We normally stay at the Marriott Desert Ridge or Sheraton Wildhorse Pass whenever we go to Phoenix but we decided to give the Pointe Tapatio a try. The check in process was fairly easy. Alexis was very attentive and took care of our needs in a timely manner. From there we walked over to the concierge desk to get information on the hiking trails on property. The lady behind the desk I believe her name was Marion was more than helpful and she had a neat Irish accent. When we finally got to our room I must say we were a tad disappointed in the furniture. It was rather dated and looked like it belonged in my grandmother's living room. I wans't too fond of the popcorn ceiling either. I expect a four star resort to atleast have suites up to date with the 21st century. Besides that, the beds were ultra comfy and the suite was spacious nevertheless. After we spent some time in our suite and freshened up a bit we decided to throw on our bathing suits and head to The Falls pool area. It was a HOT day (as expected in Phoenix) and the pool sounded fantastic. As we entered the Falls we were greeted by the young ladys in the gift shop who all seemed very nice and happy to be at work. The pool was CROWDED but I guess that's expected on a 3 day weekend. Luckily we found a couple seats not too far from the waterslide. Speaking of the waterslide my kids really enjoyed it. They probably went on it atleast 50 times. The teenagers that patroled the waterslide were very nice. I forgot the guys name at the top but he would always socialize with us while we waited in line to go down the slide. Aside from the slide, they did have activities for the kids every half hour. My six year old really enjoyed all of the water activities. The two girls that ran the activities Katie and Carri did a great job interacting with the kids and the kids seemed to love them. Now on to the service. Our server was Anthony and I must say for the place to be so crowded, he did an excellent job attending to our needs. He was very polite and guest oriented. We decided to give the chicken nachos a try. The nachos were delivered by DJ. I noticed him from the bell desk. I guess he works multiple departments. Very nice kid with good mannerisms (yes ma'am, no ma'am, etc). I asked him for extra sour cream and salsa and it was delivered to me in a jiffy. We had no reason to walk up to the bar since our drinks were delivered to us so I can't comment on bar service. Later in the evening we did give the hiking trails a try. It was a very nice hike and it was safe for the most part. We did hike up to the restaurant at the top of the hill to check out the views and I must say I was very impressed with the scenic views of the city. We took a few pictures to show our friends back in Flagstaff. We did not get the opportunity to dine at one of the restaurants on property so I can't comment on that. However, I hear great things about the Different Point of View Restaurant and will definitely dine there my next trip back to Phoenix. Overall we just came to the resort to take advantage of the pools for a couple of days and we do recommend this resort to travelers looking for fun on a budget. Thanks Pointe Tapatio staff!

Pros: The resort was very unique and picturesque, built into the rocky cliffs. The staff in the lobby was fantastic; the doorman was friendly and chatty, the check-in staff were helpful and informative. We enjoyed the complimentary cactus lemonade available in the lobby. Our room (a mountainside suite) had a large king bedroom and a blacony with a lovely view of the area and the nightly sunset. Self-parking was available right next to our building. The waterpark was fun! We ate dinner at the waterpark restaurant then splashed one of the two big pools. (The waterslide closes at dusk, so be sure to try it out in the afternoon!) The price of our stay was very inexpensive compared to other resorts in the area. Also, location is convenient (about 20 min drive) to the airport when it was time to go. Cons: The resort is definitely older. Our room had a cumbersome layout, with a small sink area and small bathroom stuck in between the bedroom and living area. The room was very large, so it didn't make sense that the bathroom areas were so small. Our air conditioner was very loud - it would turn on & shut off with a loud clunk, waking me up a couple times in the night. We could also hear noise & people talking on the street below - these happened to be resort employees loading and/or unloading a van at 10:30 p.m. Overall, an average resort - but a good quick stopover for an afternoon at the pool.

We thought we had got a great price on the rooms that included a breakfast package so everyone could eat for free. Well this was not the case. First the breakfast package that you pay for with the room is not a free breakfast. You get vouchers aka coupons for a free meal but you still have to pay tax on that meal, and tip.(I had no problem paying a tip, I work in a restaurant and always expect to tip) So you still end up paying over $40 for the breakfast for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids, and 1 infant(they charged for her too.) Also when we first arrived we didn't even receive enough vouchers for the breakfast so we spent over an hour total between the restaurant and the front desk trying to figure out why we did not receive enough vouchers to begin with, then when we got our bill to check out they charged our room for the same meals that were on the voucher, so again we had to spend time going to the front desk waiting in line for another 30mins, hearing other people having similar problems with added charges on the bill that was not theirs. Everything here is an extra charge so have lots of money with you to pay because you will need it. The employees are nice, they all say hi, the bellmen are great very nice and helpful, they warned us about the $10 fee for the fitness center per day, and told us to do the $2.25 per day package to keep that fee lower, but even when we did that we still had issues on being billed wrong as well even after I called and verified it, another trip to the front desk.

Startled when flipped over towel to find it completely black and covered with various detritus and filth. Performed same check in vanity tile area. Even worse.

Front desk is appalled and moves us to a fourth room \"closer to the lobby area where you should be fine.\" Fine? Eric the \"Safety\" mgr, supervisor, or whatever, appears. He could not be less interested. He pokes around. Looks at cockroach under glass like, \"So what? It's not even that big\". Eric seems comatose. Or maybe just bored. He says nothing. Mgr Joe is gone.

Lying there, in sweet repose, is a large yellow cookie crumb, with smaller crumbs lazily adorning its edges. Crumbs are surrounded by lustrous, ebony strands of hair. We motion bellman over to look. He looks dutifully. We ask if he would want to sleep in that bed. He shuffles his feet awkwardly and stands at attention by the TV. He doesn't know what to say. He is again summoned to see the offending crumbs and hair. He is asked again whether he would want to sleep in that bed. He looks around to see if anyone else is around and seeing no one, says, \"No Way! That's gross, man.\" We check out. Again, I ask for GM to call me. I am assured he will. He does not and has not. That was Thursday and Friday. It is now Tuesday. A few remarks: We are Hilton Honors members and we've stayed at the Pointe well over 30 times in 20 years. We've never used Priceline but this time a friend guaranteed the best rate using his \"method\" and got a great deal for us. Upside is great rate. Downside is that not even God can get a refund if things go south. Ok, we learned a lesson. We are not starry-eyed conventioneers from Ohio, who have never seen a gorgeous mountain sunset or been anywhere with nine pools. Neither are we never satisfied, hotel guests from hell. Hotels are staffed with people. People are human. Nothing is perfect. Even so, in over 25 years of global travel, our stay at the Pointe earned a place on our Top 5 Worst Hotels Ever list (Romania's Hotel Razvan taking first). To Management: There is no excuse, not one, ever, to have a mouse, cockroach, or other bug infestation and fail to act or disclose it. Employees who pretend not to notice problems, or fail to report problems to managers, suggest corporate culture issues. Minimizing problems and their effect on guests is not only arrogant; it is insulting. Denying there is a problem at all, when photographs exist, everyone is looking directly at the problem (mouse droppings, wet soap mush in the tub, black filthy floors, cockroaches, etc) and when clearly, the problem is recurring, is dishonest. Failing at least to appear, act, fake, or pretend to be interested in a guest's unhappy and disgusting experience, is unconscionable. Lastly, failing to contact unhappy guests, regardless of loyalty, or whether they carry HH cards, especially when a guest specifically requests it, is a sign of utter contempt. Nota bene: An online posting that starts with a template stating \"We are disappointed\" or \"We are saddened\" or \"We apologize for...\" is unnecessary, and its sincerity inherently suspect. A bellman already informed us not to expect anyone to care about our nightmarish experience unless we post in Trip Advisor. Another employee told us that the GM faithfully reads the Trip Advisor reviews and responds because the reviews are public. This is the same manager who never contacted us while we were there and still has not bothered to call. When we have more time, we will post this review in other travel forums to which subscribe or of which we are members (absent any spelling and grammar errors \u2013 haste and all that). *** Note: Night bellman, a college kid, provided excellent service. He was very knowledgeable about the property and available guest service. Sadly, we do not remember his name. Second, the front desk manager and staff are true professionals. Outstanding problem solving skills, excellent service, thoughtful hosts.***", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgetown, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort\u201d", "Author": "missmandymarie412", "ReviewID": "UR107549803", "Content": "This resort is impressive as soon as you drive up to it.

Even with the amount of people checking in from the event, it was a breeze. The staff was very organized and helpful. Our room was really nice and spacious. We were near the main building and one of the many pools. There was a large sitting area with a TV, couch, chair, and desk with doors the opened into a large, updated bathroom and separate vanity area. The only issue I had with our room was that we were on the ground level of the hotel so our patio area was below ground level. We would have only had a view of the parking lot but being below ground level made the room a little dark. That's the only problem with being part of a large group reservation- you don't get to make your own reservation. Parking is a bit a problem at the resort. There is ample parking, it just seems like there are cars parked everywhere. Mainly along the curbs occasionaly blocking walking paths. The pools are awesome! They are the best part of the resort.

Arizona is just what was needed. I was able to book this hotel after about an hour and half on the phone. The online reservation system accepted my reseravaton with e upgrade request, but never sent me an email with the actual reservation confirmation. The e upgrade came through. No one could explain it and even the supervisors couldn't make the reserves. Finally we called the property, directly, and they were able to make the reservations. Once we arrived at the property we were greeted at the front desk by friendly, helpful agents. The clerk was very nice and was even able to get us an upgrade to a king suite, after we told her about the reservation problems. All the rooms on the property are suites. Our room was close to the lobby and overlooking two of the many pools. My only complaints were with the rooms. The A/C was extremely noisy and we had the engineer come into fix it. Good A/C is a must when it is 102 degrees. There were mini bars in the rooms, but no fridges. There seemed to be a space for one, but it would have been nice to have a small fridge in the room. Also, in this day and age it seems amazing to me that a company as large as Hilton would still charge for WiFi. They had a daily rate, but no weekly rate. Rather than mess with it we would pack up our computer and take it to a local restaurant to plan our day. So the Pointe missed out on our using their restaurant for breakfast every day. There was a large group at the property for part of the week we were there. Everywhere we turned we were turned away because the group was having an event. The property needs to have a little more attention paid to cleanlieness. The large pool area had plates and food that would not be picked up for hours. The staff was always extremely friendly and would bend over backward to make sure you were having a great time. We went to dinner one night at the Different Pointe of View and it was lovely. The staff, from the cocktail lounge to the dining room were professional, friendly and helpful. The food was excellent and we had a beautiful evening. Do not miss the view from here, if even only for a drink. It was a good week and the hotel is a good value for the money. This hotel was very quiet.

The first thing one must be aware of is this property is huge and spread out. Signage is almost non-existent and at first it is difficult to find your way around the grounds. Make sure and have a property map and start your explorations from the main reception area. Upon our arrival things started on the wrong foot. I had requested a suite with a view and was informed those rooms had been booked and we would be located down the bluff a short ways. When I asked if we would still have a view I was informed that we would. In deed we did, of the main parking lot. In the evening if one leaned way out onto the balcony a thin area of city lights could be seen so I guess the statement wasn't totally untrue. We found our room, with the aid of a map, and believe me when I say the parking is horrid. If you find a spot in the winding streets comprising the resort, take it, you don't know if you'll ever find another one. Entering our room to be honest, we almost turned around and left. The rooms (suite) are extremely dated with old mediterranean colors and satiny cloth. After the shock of the old fashioned color scheme wore off we explored the room and found to our delight that it was laid out perfectly for and extended stay. The living area, bathroom and bedroom were very private from each area. Each person could move about the suite without bothering their partner. And of course they have the wonderful Hilton beds. We did alot of sightseeing but still came back to the resort to take advantage of the great restaurants they offered. Choices were good and prices were reasonable In all I found the resort quite pleasurable with the exception of the parking situation. If you just utilize the resort and don't travel the parking situation shouldn't cause you grief.

Take rt 51 to get there, despite what the gps says. lol. We had heard about the restaurant on top of the mountain, since it was dusk we saw it from about 5 minutes away and knew we were getting close. Once there you pull up to a beautiful archway. There we met the first of may great employees of this hilton, he introduced himself with \"welcome to the pointe hilton tapatio cliffs resort my name is Russ, let me show where you can go to check in and i will get your bags\" i believe his name tag said bell captain. On several other occasion in which he went above and beyond to help us with directions and even places to eat. He made me feel welcomed immediately. As my girlfriend began the check in process (which was very quick and easy) Nicole at the front desk described in detail the hotel and all of its vast amenities. We decided we needed to pick up a few items from the store, which is when we spoke to Sydney, who coincidentally, my girlfriend spoke to when she made the reservation originally. So she suggested somewhere that was close by and easy to get to and Russ provided us with directions (that could've been followed blindfolded) because it dropped us off at the front door of the store that Sydney suggested. We then went to our room. It was at this time (because I am a smoker and preferred a balcony) we went back to the front desk to see if we could have our room changed. Nicole immediately checked if they had any of those rooms available and thankfully there were. Nicole and my girlfriend went and saw the room before Nicole was happy we had just the right room, even though her shift was about to end. She suggested my girlfriend go enjoy the pool (with me) while she made the keys for our new room. Not only did she instruct the night manager of the situation, she wrote us a personal note, which made us feel so attended to. We were very impressed.The rest of our stay was very much of the same, the night concierge, Karen, helping us get to the diamondback game, the girl at the desk (I think her name was Betty) who gave us the reader's digest version of what arizona had to offer. During the day the resort had 8 different pools and sunbathing areas. The family pool is were they have the mini water park, yes i said it, a water park!! it's a perfect blend of adult and family fun. there is a bar/restaurant called \"cascades\" good food and very reasonably priced. Steve our waiter was attentive and always there when we needed something, but never felt like he was lurking around. As i went down the 140 ft waterslide and ran like a kid back and forth, the lifeguard Matt was great with all the kids and adults that wanted to go down the slide. he heard my girlfriend talking about getting a picture of me coming out the bottom of the slide. so before i went, he radioed down to make sure the pool was clear before the next person went (which was me) and informed the girl at the bottom to tell my girlfriend to get ready. Sure enough she got the shot! There were much quieter pools for those who just wanna relax. The night before we left, we met with friends of ours who lived in phoenix for cocktails at the restaurant in the resort called \"different pointe of view\" we were taken aback by the breath taking views from the patio lounge. the sun was setting and you could see all of phoenix from above as it began to light up and was such a romantic view.

The rooms (at least in the main building) were downright dumpy.

They had to send the handyman down, who wrenched on it for about 10 minutes to get it to pull out. (I had read elsewhere that this was a problem for other guests, but thought, \"How hard could it be? It's a sleeper sofa!\" Well, I was wrong). The most disturbing - as a Mom of two small children, is the huge 6\"-8\" gap at the bottom of the railings which line walkways and the balconies. A small child (ours is 18-months) could easily, EASILY slip through and fall. We were given a 4th floor room, but had to move to a ground floor room because it was the only one that didn't have this rail. The upside was the pool at the Waterfall area. There was ample room for us to spread out and relax. The gradual slope that the little ones can walk into the water themselves, was helpful so that they could splash without having to be held to get in and out of the water. Unfortunately, the photos for the Hilton site are FAR above and beyond what you actually get for the rooms. They fooled us. We actually ended up canceling the last two days of our stay and booked at another hotel. I was surprised that Hilton would allow one of their properties to have such low standards.

It is one of the best hotels in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and you can get a room for $99.00 until Jan. 5th (and around $220-50 after\u2026good breaks for AAA members). We have stayed at the Phoenician, The Hyatt at Gainey Ranch, The Wigwam, etc. (Someone mentioned that they left the Tapatio because they thought it was not up to snuff, and they were going over to the Phoenician...just be aware that the Phoenician is about 3 times the cost of the Tapatio.) Of all those hotels, we often prefer to go to The Tapatio because: 1. Wonderfully friendly staff who go out of their way to say hello or to help you out. This includes the check-in staff, the hotel room-service delivery people, the gift shop people and the whole assortment of the people at the golf course. Someone commented in a post that \u201c...the service people always had their hand out for a tip.\u201d I have never felt pressured to give anyone a tip. However, at any resort tipping is just part of the deal. It is normal to tip: the bellboy, the waitresses, and anyone who does something special for you such as bring an extra pillow, etc. Also, at any golf course, it is proper to tip the person who cleans your clubs when you come in. 2. The rooms are suites. The first is, of course, the living room. That is separated from the bedroom by an ingenious system of doors on either side of the bathroom (The bathroom has a pass-through from the living room to the bedroom\u2026basin and mirror on one side, toilet and bath on the other with a door.) which is between the two rooms\u2026one that closes between the living room and the bathroom and one that closes between the bathroom and the bedroom; this allows people in one room to close off the other room but to still use the bathroom. Also, the T.V. on in one room can\u2019t be heard in the other. I see in a couple of posts that people though the place needs up-grading. Actually, the hotel did one of those hugely expensive \u201cre-dos\u201d two years ago. Unfortunately, the colors they picked are a bit drab which gives the rooms a less that bright appearance. The beds have feather pillows and feather quilts. There is a wet bar and refrigerator in the living room. 2 wide screen t.v.\u2018s., and adequate lighting by each side of the bed. 3. There are two main restaurants. One is paneled with mahogany and is very handsome. Good food, reasonably priced for a resort. Great bar and a friendly atmosphere. Then there is their very slick \u201cA Point of View\u201d restaurant with terrific views of Phoenix/Scottsdale, but we have not eaten there. 4. You want pools? They\u2019ve got pools. A huge water-wonderland set up with slides, etc. Two smaller pools are near the main part of the hotel\u2026rarely busy (one is adults only), and one on top of the hill. Fitness center. And here is something outstanding: the hotel does not charge the usual $10-$12 a day \u201cresort fee\u201d which I have come to hate at all hotels. 5. GOLFERS! Listen up. The course is terrific. It is kept in first-class condition. The course has been called \u201cthe Phoenix areas best kept secret.\u201d The staff was very accommodating. The course climbs up and up until the 9th (at which point you are 3 miles from the clubhouse) where you can see for miles in either direction. There are some pretty tricky holes where doglegs, water and thick desert flora abound. Deep traps. Undulating greens, Fun. I wasn\u2019t paid to be this upbeat about the hotel!

It has been years since I stayed at a Hilton property and the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort won me over. I actually landed myself in a wheelchair last fall after a hiking accident. It's temporary until I recover, but nonetheless, terribly inconvenient. The folks at point Hilton Tapatio accommodated my every need. They helped me every day with giving me extra laundry bags so I could fill with ice to ice my ankle every night, the staff was proactive in helping me plate my food from the buffets, help me across doorway thresholds, and the shuttle to get around the property were invaluable--and you don't even need to be disabled to request them. I was in an ADA suite, which was gigantic! The room was equipped with everything at the right level so I could access and I had bars to hang on to. The one improvement that could be made is to the door. I found myself stuck on how to get inside my room when I don't have anyone around to help. It's very complicated when you're in a wheelchair. I had to ask a bell boy for help one time. Another time when I was alone I got the door open, had to hop out of my chair on one foot while holding the heavy door (heaven forbid if I should break my other leg while doing so). And then I had to figure out how to get the wheelchair in the door, since the breaks were on. Management should brainstorm about how to make this easier for those in ADA rooms, is all I'm saying. Otherwise, loved my room. The staff at the spa was equally accommodating and helpful, as were the valets at the Different Point of View restaurant and their staff. (I have to tell you, though, the handicap-accessible bathrooms at the Different Point of View restaurant aren't truly wheelchair accessible, as their decal on the outside of the door would suggest. I couldn't get my wheelchair into the handicap stall. My husband (who was traveling with me to assist) had to come into the ladies room with me to help me out. Oh well. Just sayin'. Could use some improvement there. Otherwise, I really enjoyed my stay and was only saddened by the fact that I was really limited in mobility. I wanted to tour the property, but really couldn't do so in my situation. I will have to come back sometime (maybe my company will book there again) and truly enjoy all the property has to offer. One more thing. The room service menu could use more choices. Would also like to see more variety, including choices with a southwest flair, since I was a visitor to Phoenix.

Unfortunately, those are the only three positives that I can come up with for this hotel: 1. The furniture in the sitting-room (a love seat and some kind of arm chair) was *extremely* uncomfortable. There was a rolling office-type chair (great for using after you get tired of the other, uncomfortable furniture), but the back on it couldn't be locked in the upright position, so you can't lean back if you decide to watch TV while you're sitting in it. 2. The room didn't have a microwave in it. 3. The water in the shower didn't get hot. In fact, it never got above warm. 4. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. (This can be an issue if you don't have any spray air freshener!) I talked to the front desk staff, and they said that NONE of the rooms in the main building have exhaust fans in the bathrooms, only the bathrooms in the out-lying buildings do. Figure that one out! 5. The sliding glass door to the balcony had a broken latch, and couldn't be locked. (It would have taken very little effort for someone to climb up to the second floor and come in, either while we were away or while we were asleep.) 6. Helicopters! All day and ALL NIGHT!!! (I realize that the hotel can't control whether or not helicopters over fly your room, but that doesn't make them any less annoying, especially when they wake you from a sound sleep.) 7. Finally (and this is the one that I find truly amazing), after you pay the premium rate for staying at this place, they want to charge you for Internet access! I wanted to send a copy of this review to Hilton, but the corporate page for sending comments / feedback to Guest Relations only had a small area for entering text. I e-mailed them and asked for an address I could send this review to so that they could address these issues. The next person that I heard from was the manager at the hotel itself, who is responsible for these terrible conditions to begin with. When I e-mailed Corporate back, telling them I wanted to send my review directly to them, I didn't hear anything further, so I guess they're not really interested in the experiences that their customers have at their hotels. However, I really wanted to let them know about my experience, so I telephoned them and got an e-mail address that I can send this to; maybe now these issues will be corrected.

We were reassigned when I mentioned our voucher was THE Presidential Suite and told that they had multiple suites of this catagory. The lady at the desk who was very pleasant, told us this was one of their favorite rooms because of it's view. Well, if we stood leaning over our balcony, looked through buildings and a bit around our balcony, we could see a pool and a bit of the city and by gosh, a parking lot. It was a nice corner room that had another view of a building, and the last view was a mound that had a road on top of it, so we heard both cars going up and down and people on the stairs. (And stairs from the parking lot do not have rails, not for the faint of heart). Once in the room it was quite nice, however NOT presidential. The first thing I always look at is the tub, and this was NOT a tub that I wanted to sit in. It was an old ordinary tub/shower combination, similar to a rental apartment set up. There were 2 bathrooms which was a nice feature, too bad someone didn't take the time to put one of the sinks in properly, poor workmanship (husband's a general contractor) and one of the toilets ran every 20 minutes. We thought it was the neighbor's shower so didn't say anything. The amenities where typical of any room, shampoo, soap, lotion, but not a 'Presidential Suite'. The coffee maker was nice, too bad one of the mugs wasn't clean. It had a Hilton and a local things to do magazine. Too bad they were from 2008. Everything seemed to have a 'too bad'. Even the current letter in the room that offered something in the gift shop wasn't up to date. When I inquired, the lady told me they didn't have that special anymore. (Sheet was dated October 2010) She seemed a bit clueless about the letter from the room. Included in our package was golf. Mike, Dave, the pro shop gentleman, the snack cart lady and everyone else were wonderful even if the Marshall did seem a bit clueless about driving his cart around just as I was ready to hit.

I have stayed at this resort many times over many years, the last being several years ago. I stopped purposely due to events that have changed my view of this hotel for good. I am reminded that I have never written a review and wish to make amends and let those who wish to stay here know just how this resort has changed over the years. Back in the '80's, I first encountered the Pointe at Tapatio and found it to be a most luxurious and comforting hotel. I loved the beautiful spanish villas, the lush grounds, the sumptuous and relaxing suites with their separate living rooms. There was a quiet, a calm, a sense of all is right with the world. Staff were always attentive and concerned about my stay. Everything about the place spoke of style and luxury. I thoroughly enjoyed relaxing by the pool, swimming, dozing, letting the minutes tick by. Then something began to happen. As the years went by and the '80's became the '90's and on, the pricing began to change. I couldn't help but notice that the rate kept on decreasing. At first, I thought I had gone to heaven. On the other hand, events started to happen that turned this reverie of a resort into something else. On several occasions during one stay, we had to call security to break up several loud parties happening around the pool, then in several rooms. We had one incident where a drunk guest had fallen asleep on his TV remote after locking himself in his room. The remote kept the hotel channel on at high volume and we were woken up at 2am by the hugely loud noise coming from next door. It took security over an hour to break into his room and shut the TV off. We were relocated next to the garbage area, which had an ongoing noise problem of its own. On other occasions, and by that I mean every single visit in the '90's and into the early to mid 2000's, I personally had to re-route families out of the adult pool towards the family pool and that was met quite often with hostility. I did also call security to handle these events, but the annoyance of having the adult quiet broken up by a family kid party was real. On most of these occasions, and over the Labor Day Weekends, guests drank heavily and smoked in the pool, and were a rough, noisy crowd. We were told by management, and observed on several occasions, that the cops had to be called just about every weekend. They also revealed to us that on the weekends the guests were quite often locals who were taking advantage of the $79 rates for the use of the hotel. When you start to charge dirt cheap rates for such an incredible resort, you are going to attract the rowdies. I suppose that at some point upper management made a decision that they needed to attract more business. If that's the case, it's a shame that, by lowering the rates, they have run off those of us who had enjoyed the Pointe Tapatio as an oasis of serenity. I have read recent reviews that have mentioned the rough crowd that often frequents the adult pool. As long as this is the policy of this hotel, that being having rates that apparently attract a crowd who use the hotel as their partying ground, I will not be back. I have been to cheap hotels in my life where I knew what I was getting and knew that the crowd who could afford them were on the rowdy side. The Pointe Tapatio should not be brought down to that standard, but needs to raise the rates back up and find ways to market itself as the upscale resort that it presents itself to be. Until management will own up to the problem, I will never be back and I will not recommend this resort except for families.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cleveland, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cNot as good as it was a few years back\u201d", "Author": "Terriv", "ReviewID": "UR82187825", "Content": "This was my fourth stay at the resort. Check in went smoothly at 3:00, I don't think the resort had more than 50 rooms booked this week. We were given a Cliffside room, which was nice, nice view, but if you have limited mobility at all, stay away. Parking is odd here due to being built into a mountainside, very hard to open the car door in this area of the resort due to hill parking. Don't bother trying to walk anywhere in the desert heat on the hills of the resort. Drive or use the free shuttle. I remember the rooms being brighter and having a slight southwestern decor. The room we received was rather dark, with dark green drapery, a dark sofa. Limited wall decor. The carpet was older looking, too dark for the area. It would have suited a colder Midwestern city much better than AZ. But it worked for our four night stay. The AC sounded like a semi driving by for the time it was running, but it kept the room cool. The overstocked refrigerator was placed in a strange location which inhibited getting into it easily. The Sunset pool was nice but the hot tub was too hot to use, probably an unsafe temperature. There were broken tiles on the steps neat the pool which I would consider unsafe. I requested the hot tub be turned down and ash trays made available and neither request was attended to. There is a Starbucks in the lobby which was nice and offered less expensive drinks than the gift shop. The Terrace Bar at the hilltop restaurant is very nice, but quite overpriced Two basic mixed drinks with a tip was $30. But it was worth the trip up there for the sunset and comfortable seating either inside or out. If it's cool enough at night, go up there and sit outside, great view and atmosphere. Hiking in the adjacent mountain at sunrise is a nice treat. Easy to moderate trails, great views, neat wildlife. A few nearby restaurants with decent pricing for all three meals. Scramble for breakfast and El Bravo for dinner are my recommendations. I may return if I have to stay for business again, but I would not pick this resort for a vacation as I have done in the past.

However, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were initially assigned a room in the Mountainside section of the property, but staff happily relocated us closer to main building when we requested this at check-in. We were cautioned that there would be some light construction occuring near our new room location (3047) and advised we could move again if this was an issue. We didn't hear the workers at all, but greatly appreciated the staff providing us this \"heads up\". The rooms nearest the main lobby are definitely the most convenient for enjoying all the property amenities. We had a few little room glitches - no inner handle on the bathroom door; toilet paper holder kept coming out of the wall - but the front desk was most responsive and got these fixed when we called. (What kind of hotel guest steals bathroom door handles???) We were really pleased to learn that our Hilton Honours membership allowed us some perks, including custom-made breakfast at one of the hotel restaurants. The reception and concierge staff were consistently helpful. Marion, at the concierge desk, gave exceptional service. The restaurant staff were great and remembered our preferences after the first couple of visits. The cleaning staff did a beautiful job every day. We only went over to the Falls pool one day and found that the number of guests was quite manageable at the upper pool (not near the bar), but moved our \"lounging location\" to the adult pool when we realized it was just as pleasant and hardly used by anyone. We were delighted that the Pointe in Time restaurant allowed us to credit our continental breakfast voucher to other menu options. Many hotel restaurants don't give this kind of flexibility. My omments in response to the critical Trip Advisor postings are these: Some of the younger staff didn't seem to have the confidence to confront guests who were breaking the rules. We observed people walking past the staff at the entrance to the Falls without showing hotel keys or providing names. There were 6 adults and 9 kids in the cabana next to us, despite the fact that the cabanas are supposed to be limited to 6 guests in total. Most guests seemed to have brought in their own food. So, although we had no difficulties while at the Falls, I could see how crowd control might become an issue on hot days. I would encourage hotel management to pair up younger staff with more experienced staff for a little coaching on handling difficult guests. I would also encourage managment to assign a staff member to tour the other pools on a periodic basis. There were a couple of times that we had kids in the adult pool, dogs at poolside and large group of younger guests haul in their cooler full of beer, which they proceeded to drink in the pool. It wasn't until a staff member arrived that the errant guests were asked, in the nicest way possible, to respect the rules for the pool area. This made for a more pleasant experience for those of us who were craving a quiet, refined poolside experience. However... we sometimes went several hours without seeing any hotel staff at the pool. We enjoyed staying at such a beautiful resort with such great staff for such a very, very reasonable price.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, Canada", "Title": "\u201cToo short!\u201d", "Author": "Denis_The_Thief", "ReviewID": "UR74170892", "Content": "Had an excellent stay, the only problem was our stay was too short - only 2 nights!

It is true that it was difficult to park near the room but this place is literally built on a cliff which was part of its charm. So some of the units had little room for parking but I think with the Main Building, parking was close, so I suggest anyone with difficulty walking would need to request a suite in the Main Building. I also heard that the resort pools get quite busy during the weekends, we did not encounter any crowds although we stayed during the week. I can't say a whole lot about the service or front desk since we really didn't need anything but our impression was that everyone was quite friendly.

But afterour awful stay we knew we needed to stay another night at some place better. We decided to risk it and stay at another Hilton, and it was well worth it! We started off at check - in and I pulled up to what I thought was registration parking, I later realized I had passed the registration parking and was really pulling up to valet, but the valet guy, Dick, didn't even tell us we were in the wrong spot, welcomed my girl friend and I, and offered to watch my car while we check-in. I handed him the keys and walked inside to the lobby. (Dick was the nicest valet guy we have come in to contact with so far, not only was he very service oriented, he was generally nice! He didn't care that it was 110 degrees outside and he was stuck in the heat, he was nice and offered assitance and good advice!) There was tons of people in the lobby, and we were ready for a 20 minute wait to check-in. But we still werent discouraged, because we felt like we were at a resort in Mexico or something. Within about 2 minutes we were already being called to check - in. The check-in process was quick and easy, and the front desk agent (I forgot her name, but she was from Georgia) was very helpful, and gave us a bunch of advice and we got a really good room considering we had booked about 1 hour before. After getting all checked in we returned back to the front where Dick brought our car back around, and took my job of opening the door for my girlfriend and giving us tips of where to park. Parking at this resort is pretty hectic. If you want to park near the room its like parking in a busy city. Parallel parking along the side of the rooms. Its hard to picture but this resort is like a mini city, and there is tons of different buildings, and you just park parallel to the buildings out front. Luckily for us they also have a large central parking lot, because it was impossible to find parking near the room. But it wasn't a far walk. We got to the room and it was really nice. You walk in to the living room area, with a sofa (not sure if it pulls out into a bed or not, we didn't need it to so we didn't check), a desk, and a flat screen tv. You then pass through the bathroom and in to the bedroom. It had a king size bed which was pretty comfortable, a standard TV and then a balcony with some chairs and patio furniture. All of this was just $99 a night and this is the standard rate (and it was 4th of July weekend!). We headed down to the pool right away, or should I say pools! This resort has 8 pools on property. One for adults only with a swim up bar, one for families, one that is smaller and open 24 hours a day, another smaller one near the fitness room, another one that is hidden for relaxation, and then the main ones. The main pools were awesome, they were huge with waterfalls, there is also a waterslide and a water volleyball court. In the pool area there is a full service bar, and one of the main pools even shows movies somenights while you are swimming. The only downside is the pools were all very busy, but of course it was a holiday weekend. We ended up going to dinner and coming back around 830 and the pools were a lot more manageable, less people so more fun! We only stayed one night, but you could easily make a 5 day vacation at this hotel. Summary: Excellent staff and service from check in, to the random guy driving around in the Hilton van offering all and any assistance you could ever need. The hotel is clean, the rooms are nice and the pool is awesome. You feel like you are in Mexico at an expensive beach resort.

If you are well off, perhaps you'll like this hotel. I found my stay there to be irritating and distasteful. The only bright spots during this stay were the girl who took care of our room and the guy who drove the van in the morning. Both were incredibly kind people and wonderful to interact with. Even though the girl had a disadvantage with the English language, she went out of her way to provide us with an item we were looking for at the last minute when my sister decided to color my hair the morning of the wedding. She was a stellar provider of our needs during our entire stay and had the most excellent customer service skills! The morning driver was equally kind and attentive, offering his knowledge about where things were in the area. (I found the resort to be quite remote from regular shops and restaurants, which became old very quick.) When we arrived at our hotel room, it seemed nice. There was a living room area with a large TV and a desk to work on your computer in the front of the room. The bathroom area separated it from the sleeping area which had two double beds (which provided a VERY nice night's sleep) with another large TV in case you want to watch something before going to sleep. Everything looked very nice, however, after getting to know and use the room I began to see how irritating the place was. We were told before coming to Phoenix that the rooms had a refrigerator in them. I liked that idea because I prefer raw, organic foods and they need a fridge. When we got there, we found out two very important things they DON'T tell you beforehand. #1) The fridge is PACKED with junk! Candy bars, soft drinks full of cane sugar, nothing of nutritional value with the exception of bottled water and a couple of very expensive teas. I'm not exaggerating when I say packed either. It was packed to the brim. #2) You are financially responsible for anything and everything that goes in or out of the refrigerator OR the top of the bar it sits under! That's right - if someone else comes in your room and eats a candy bar or drinks one of the bottles of water, you are financially responsible for that $3.50 candy bar or $6 bottle of water you could have gotten from the 7-11 for one or two dollars. The prices on everything in it were hideous! It deeply disturbs me that I have to be responsible for someone else's inventory that I didn't want in my room in the first place. I had written down the costs of the items in the bar, some which were $6-10 an item but I forgot to write this review when I returned home and have no idea where it went. I have no problem tipping someone at a restaurant 30% or more for exceptional service, but the markup on the bar items was ridiculous. My other complaint about the bar was it's location (pictures included). Who puts a bar with the door backwards so you can't actually get in it? With my mobility problems, I had to ask my mother to constantly squeeze back into the hole to get our things out. Seriously? You couldn't have a maintenance man move the hinges so people could actually get into the fridge? Who designs a room so the dresser is right on top of the refrigerator door anyway? My biggest irritation during the entire time we stayed there was the internet. While Starbucks offers free internet service nation-wide, the Starbucks at this resort (inside the main building) was not allowed to have it. You were forced to PAY every day for internet service. The cost? $11.95 (that's $12) a DAY for the privilege of internet access in your room. I pay $19.95 a month for 3 MBPS High Speed DSL at my home. I felt like I was paying $5.00 per gallon for gas all over again. Perhaps I'm more sensitive about this because where I live EVERYONE offers free Wi-Fi. McDonalds, Burger King, every coffee place like Starbucks and Panera Bread, the library, the hotels at the oceanfront - EVERYONE offers free Wi-Fi so even if you didn't have your own internet service, you could pretty much drive almost anywhere and pick it up. A hotel chain like the Hilton should NOT be charging for service like this, at the VERY least not half of what it costs per month for one day's connection to the internet. If you're doing something when your 24 hours runs out, forget about it. You don't get a reminder to pay again, you are simply cut off so that anything you were working on online is lost. That, to me, is horrid customer service. Of course when you have a complaint about the service, the Hilton just blames it on the carrier they contract so there's nothing to be done. Again, atrocious customer service in this area. My cell phone was not meant to be a laptop and I shouldn't have to try and make due with it because of a hotel's lack. Speaking of using the computer, the desk provided was a hazard (picture included). I managed to slam my ankle into the sharp corners at the bottom of it twice. It left some nice bruises. Be VERY careful if you're going to spend any time on your computer while there. Bring a LAN cable extension as you can't go wireless and the cord is too short to make it over to the sofa. One of the reasons I find this complex unfriendly to the physically challenged was, of all things, the shower curtain (picture included). Unlike other hotels who use plastic shower liners, the Hilton uses a flimsy sheer liner. I am vertically mobile, but I should probably be using a cane. I have issues with my hip joints and a painful condition in both feet (thanks to the 6-inch heels I used to wear in my corporate days). Taking a shower requires care so I don't slip and break something, consequently my showers take a little longer than most. When I stepped out of the shower the first time, there was a lake of water on the floor. The second time I used it, I specifically pointed the nozzle towards the wall of the bathtub and the water STILL leaked all over the floor (yes the liner was inside the tub). We finally just asked the maid to give us enough towels to pad the floor so it could soak up all the water that came off the sheer fabric shower liners during the showering process. I'm sorry, but I just don't get the whole \"looks over functionality\" lifestyle. The other reason I say this complex is unfriendly to the physically challenged is the whole hill theme. It's clear this resort was created by blasting holes in the hillside. The complex is full of very narrow winding, twisty roads (picture included) and you will swear the bridges connecting the buildings are going to scrape the top of the on-site van service. The roads are all one way, so regardless of whether or not your room is across the parking lot, you're going to take the long way home if your room is at the end of all the long, winding, twisty roads. These labyrinth of hills the rooms have been carved into is no place for the mobility challenged. The hills are steep (picture included) and unless your room is in the main building, it's quite a hike (picture of view across parking lot to main building included). The place the wedding took place had some nice photo opportunities, but I found the drunk guests loitering around the pool below disturbing. To be fair, the wedding was small. If you have designs on getting married there, keep that in mind. Getting delayed by some guy who's clearly had one too many and loud groups blocking the only route from the restroom back to where the wedding was set up was not a pleasant experience. The wedding reception was held in the Pointe In Tyme restaurant which was near the pool and the area the wedding was held. Again, another trek across the facility (not a problem for people in good physical shape). We had a \"wedding dinner\" and my food was cold by the time it got to me. I can't even remember what it tasted like. At this point I just didn't care. I didn't want to say anything to my brother as it was his special day. The waiters in the restaurant were very attentive when we first arrived, but I found them oddly missing after we were served dinner. Not being able to find someone to refill the water glasses at my end of the table I got up and got the water pitcher myself. We went there the next morning for the breakfast buffet and the food was good. Then again we were serving ourselves and it was kept warm at the buffet. The last thing I will say about the resort is that with the exception of the morning driver and the girl who took care of our room for us, the rest of the staff was abysmal. The girls at the front desk (specifically at night) could have walked right off of the \"Mean Girls\" movie set. I had walked to the front desk to meet my sister (her room was in the main building) so we could go somewhere as the cell phone reception in many places at the resort was spotty and not available at the time. The girl at the front desk told me she couldn't reveal the room number, which I understand. The haughty way that she relayed this to me was much less understandable. She said she would ring my sister for me and told me to go over to the white wall phone in front of the gift shop where she would transfer the call. I went over to the wall phone and waited and waited. Inasmuch as it was clear this was not a kind person, I didn't go back to try and sort it out with her. I had already walked all the way from my room over to the main building and was in a certain amount of pain from doing so. Having to deal with someone who treated hotel guests like they were inferior was not something I was going to get into. Normally, I am quite outspoken, but this was my brother's special day and I figured I ought not rock the boat until the I Do's had been spoken, least the front desk girl relay my immense displeasure over her behavior to someone working the wedding. The guy who was driving the van the night of the wedding reception was not very enjoyable either. Here was a man who was clearly financially oriented and I found it quite off-putting. In short, if you are a wonderfully, overly financially abundant, physically fit person you may enjoy the physical challenge and remote location of this hotel. If you're the type of person who looks down at others, you'll fit right in with the front desk staff. I, however, prefer customer service over EVERYTHING a hotel could offer. Without good customer service, your stay is a nightmare which is the category I put my stay at the Tapatio Cliffs Resort under. I will never stay there again and I would not recommend it to my friends who are generally kind people and would not want to experience what I did during my stay. I did learn one valuable lesson - never consider a hotel that doesn't provide free internet service. Before you wonder if this is a \"Hilton\" hotel chain problem, let me tell you I stayed at the Hilton in Dallas, Texas and the staff there were WONDERFUL!

The resort is located on the edge of a less-than desirable part of Phoenix, and you might be slightly concerned on the drive from the airport to the property. Thankfully, the immediate surroundings are not reflected at the hotel. The check-in process was fast and smooth. The layout of the resort (more on this later) requires that you park, check-in and then make your way to one of the buildings that contain the guest rooms. We had booked a Presidential Suite and were assigned a room very close to the lobby area, but it still required a careful navigation of the property using the map provided at the front desk. Our room was located on the second floor, which is apparently the case with all king-bedded rooms. If you book queens or twins, you'll be on the ground floor. Not each building has an elevator, as was the case with ours. We have to carry our 6 pieces of baggage up the stairs, which is not the most pleasant of experiences in the Arizona heat. The room was absolutely huge, and in good condition. There was a large combined living/dining area, with a wet bar area. The furniture looked a bit dated, and the two sofas were certainly designed for longevity rather than comfort. The wet bar had a fridge filled with overpriced beverages, but with enough room for a quart of milk for our son. There was also a half bath off the living area. Storage space was abundant. An old, tube-style TV was contained in a large armoire, but there was not DVD player provided, which I thought I had read was included with a Presidential Suite. The bedroom also had loads of closet space to store your bits and pieces. Curiously, there was a mount for a flat panel TV attached to the wall, but no flat panel TV. There was a tube TV balanced precariously on a protruding ledge that made me a little bit nervous, what with having a fearless 18 month old explorer in the suite. Luckily, he never went near it. The bed was extremely comfortable. Off the bedroom was a very small patio area. We had no view - we were looking out at other buildings and the parking lot. I was very disappointed by this, especially as a Hilton Hhonors Diamond member - the hotel was not full, surely they could have given me a nice valley view? The en-suite bathroom was spacious and reasonably well appointed. The morning after we arrived, we decided to go and get some breakfast (which was comped, due to my Diamond status). We set out from the room, map in hand, baby in stroller, trying to figure our way through the maze that is this resort. Having navigated three lots of steps and 1 elevator (and only progressed about 100 feet from our room!) we gave up on trying to reach the restaurant on foot when we saw an enormous flight of steps in front of us. We returned to our rental car and drove. I know there is a transport service at the resort, but who wants to call, wait for them to arrive and then have to worry about holding on to an infant during a golf cart ride? Not a viable solution. Our whole stay was somewhat marred by the lack of maneuverability around this resort without a car. If you have young kids that need to be carried, or put in a stroller, this is NOT the place to stay. It's also very hilly, so if you do opt to carry or push your little one, be prepared to sweat in the Arizona sun. Having found the restaurant, we enjoyed a decent breakfast in quite nice surroundings. The dining room is dark and upscale. The service was friendly, and the food just about what you'd expect from a Hilton - nothing too imaginative or offensive. We decided not to return the next day, even though we had the free coupons. We opted, instead, for a latte and muffin from the Starbucks in the lobby. We rented a pool-side cabana for 2 of our 3 days there. I called about 5 days in advance and the gentleman who took my reservation was very effective - he inquired about whether we wanted a cabana in the sun or shade, explained that there were units at the upper pool (near the bar) or at the lower pool (much more suited to young kids). The cabana cost $30 on the Friday and (I think) $65 on Saturday. It included a newspaper, 4 bottles of water and a deck of cards (each day). There was a table and four regular chairs, two sun loungers, a TV and a fridge in each cabana - perfect for us with the bambino. The pool-side service was regular and speedy. You can order from the full bar menu and have it delivered to your cabana. On the second day, we weren't able to sign our check before we left, although the waiter already had our room number, so that wasn't an issue, or so we thought. They automatically add a gratuity (20%?) to the bill for everything you order pool-side. Imagine my surprise when I got a call that evening asking if I wanted to close out my check by adding a gratuity! I told the lady that called (the bar manager) that I was under the gratuity was automatically added. She said, yes, it was added, her mistake. I find it slightly suspect that the manager would make such a mistake, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. I can't comment too much on the pools, as we stayed close to the edge of the lower pool, which had a walk-in side, ideal for young kids. Our son loved it and he spent most of his time sitting in the shallow water, splashing away to his heart\u2019s content. On our last day, an extremely diligent lady at the front desk went to great lengths to secure us a late check-out. I was truly impressed by her persistence and willingness to go above and beyond. I have to hand it to the staff at this resort - they were all excellent (with the possible exception of the pool bar manager, but like I said, I'll give her the benefit of the doubt!). I would return here when my kids are a little older. Right now, staying here is just too much work and it knocked some of the enjoyment out of our stay. Parking can also be an issue - be prepared to park some distance from your room and have to navigate the hills to reach your destination. As the saying goes, your mileage may vary. In fairness to the property, I will give it a 'recommend' rating, in acknowledgement of the fact that not all guest have to deal with strollers and we otherwise had a decent stay.

THE GOOD: This hotel had friendly staff that were helpful and warm/welcoming. The lady in the gift shop gave a great recommendation for authentic Mexican food. Thanks! The hotel is set amidst the cliffs hence the name, so you'll be walking uphill everywhere, which we liked. They do offer a complimentary shuttle around the resort, but we never saw anyone use it. I don't think this would be a very handicap friendly hotel. All rooms are suites w/1 bedroom or more and have balconies. This was a plus since we have two kids ages 2 & 6. It was nice to be able to put them to bed, and close the bedroom door so we could stay up. We had a wonderful dinner at their restaurant by the golf course, A Pointe in Thyme. Great value on the kids meals..only $6 for petite steak, salmon etc. Everything we ate was delicious. Love the bread. Friendly waiter and nice restaurant manager. We asked for a room near The Falls Water Pool area and were very close to it. The hotel has 2 nice size zero entry pools with built in benches inside, fountains, little grottoes and one super fast, tunnel waterslide (you have to ask them to turn it on sometimes). Our kids and us LOVED the pools and waterslide. We hung around the lower pool b/c it was quieter and offered more shade. We rented a cabana and enjoyed having friendly staff brings us drinks/food. Very relaxing and enjoyable except for the wkends. So we enjoyed ourselves until Sat. and Sun. THE BAD: Didn't know this, but the hotel offers $5.00 day pool passes to the local residents in Phoenix. So on the weekend the crowds at the pools were eclectic and quite honestly, we felt like we were on spring break w/rowdy college kids. Or at a cheap Las Vegas party hotel! It was a rough,rude, vulgar and bad language everywhere, bawdy, boisterous crowd. Not very family oriented on the weekend. In fact, a large group of what seemed like college age ppl were playing football in the pool. They were rough, hit my husband in the face w/the football almost hit my 2 year old. The person didn't even apologize for it. Not a classy crowd. Because of this we won't be back. Unfortunately, this really put a damper on what would have been a great stay. Because of this we won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to others unless you're going during the week only. Another BIG disappointment....we thought b/c of that episode we'd leave and go to the private pool right near our hotel room. Well, there were locals at that one too. There are several small, private pools around the hotel rooms that we thought only hotel stayers could go to. We were wrong and unhappily disappointed to meet more of that same rough, crowd at what we had hoped would be a peaceful escape. The hotel mgt. needs to eliminate the offer of day pool passes to locals and make the pools exclusively available to ppl staying at the hotel only. For what we payed we had hoped to enjoy the exclusivity. We tried to let mgt. know of our opinion, but played phone tag. The local couple we met told us they have been coming to the hotel pools for free for over a year. They said the staff just waves them in and doesn't charge them anymore. They also get free drinks which is a draw he said. Geesh! Another nuisance is it was hard to get a good nights sleep b/c every time the neighbors next to us flushed their toliet, or used the sink or shower, we could hear it loud and clear. Horribly loud! It's really a shame that what started out as a good retreat for us, ended in such disappointment.

Both said no. We walked to the top of the cliff for dinner (very steep walk) and learned that the restaurant was booked until 9pm and the lounge/casual area was closed for a private party. Very disappointed and frustrated. Staff at the more casual restaurant near the golf course were very pleasant and accommodating and helped us to secure a reservation at the nicer restaurant for 8:30 p.m. Played golf on Saturday off-property due to a tournament at the hotel course. When we returned, husband asked concierge (bell boy was missing) to store his clubs until departure. She rolled her eyes, and pointed down the hall and had him take his own clubs back to the luggage room, and put them back into his travel bag himself. Very inappropriate. Bell boy came into luggage room while husband was back there and apologized up and down for the situation. Disappointing that the concierge treated him that way.

Coming home after a long day of sightseeing and being able to pop in to one of many hot tubs was really a nice perk. The reason for the 4 star review is due to the dining. 17 dollars for a mediocre breakfast buffet is a little silly. So is 9 dollars for a vodka-cranberry in a little 8 oz glass. The food was good, but not THAT good. The \"Pointe in Time\" just seemed dark, dated, and overpriced, and unfortunately the nicer place is closed on Sundays.

It was huge, by far the nicest room I had ever stayed in, my wife was very surprised. We had a terrific dinner at a Different Point of View and were able to enjoy the georgous views up top the mountain of the valley.

I enjoyed the spa as well. It's not a luxurious spa, but it was still a very nice experience. Our room was nice as well. The bedroom was a little crammed as we were given a room with two double beds instead of one king bed. It wasn't too bad though because there's an extra sitting area. It's a bit of a hike if you walk up to your room after a day of golf or at the pool. They have shuttles that take you to the room if you're not up for the hike.

The grounds are beautiful and you have a wide selection of smaller pools along with the big resort pools, the setting in the hills is just beautiful- however we usually request the main building so we arn't hiking uphill with a toddler. The room makeovers with new color scheme and bedding are very nice, the suites are good sized, all staff including grounds keepers seem friendly and unobtrusive.

The resort is huge, with plenty of pools and plenty of rooms. However, our small building of rooms was packed, while much of the rest of the resort sat empty. Because the rooms are motel-style, and because the walls are paper-thin, we could hear EVERYTHING happening outside our door on the road (including doors slamming when the cars parked directly outside the doors to the rooms), outside our patio (again, on another road), next door to the right (including every word of a conversation this couple was having, even with our TV on), next door to the left (including their television program), and upstairs above us (every time they flushed their toilet, turned on their shower, used their sink, etc., it sounded like the pipes were going to burst). Seems to me that if the rooms are not very sound-proof, the hotel staff might want to spread people out so that it wouldn't be so loud, but that was most certainly not the case. There were many other issues that were disheartening, including a broken shower lever, dirty bedding, slightly torn fabric on the couch, rattling fan, no wi-fi included, receiving a 2 Queen bed room when we requested a 1 King room, etc., etc. We just felt like we were at a run-down motel. I had to keep reminding myself that we were in a Hilton. It wasn't the Hilton quality I'm used to. I did spend a day at the Falls pool area. It was pleasant. However, the hot tub was filthy -- bugs and dirt floating at the top and sunk to the bottom, and not just a little... A LOT -- and while I was sitting in it (sore muscles from tossing and turning in bed the two nights before drove me into the filth) a maintanence man came and started working on the controls, causing the bubbles to stop and start up again every time he tinkered with it. Frustrated, I left the hot tub to take a little nap in the sun, and another maintanence man came and started sawing tree branches in the pool area. Needless to say, the pool area cleared out quickly. One positive is that the people seemed friendly. In fact, one reason we were enticed by this hotel was that the GM responded to all reviews here on TripAdvisor. As aspiring B&B inkeepers, we have been to conventions where management has been encouraged to respond to reviews, to try to take the negative and say something positive about the hotel. We assume the same will happen with our review.

(By the way the Hilton buffet breakfast is absolutely amazing - there was even smoked salmon on the buffet!) The staff at the front desk were very friendly and accomodating. My thanks, especially to Sydney and to Helen at the front desk who made us feel very welcome. We had booked a one room king suite and our first room was not in the main building but in one of the cliffside rooms - it was on the top floor and the balcony had a beautiful view. Apparently all of the king suites are on the top floors. The only problem with the rooms on the top floor is that the air conditioning units are on the roof and so we didn't sleep well that first night because the noise of the air conditioners kept us awake. Granted, this noise may not have bothered some people who are used to noise but we live in a very quite neighborhood. However, when we asked to switch rooms the next day, Helen was very accomodating. She gave us our pick of a couple of rooms available and we settled for a suite with two queen beds in the main building. Both the king suite and the queen suite were very spacious and comfortable - it looked as if they had been recently rennovated. Beds were comfortable and linens were of top quality. The pools at this resort are amazing - and they even have an \"adult\" pool with very comfortable loungers for those of us who want a relaxed environment. The pools were very nicely heated -- easy to get in. My husband played golf at the resort and he said the course was beautiful. We ate several times at the golf course restaurant on the property and the service and food was excellent and very reasonably priced. If you go, be sure to get up to the Point of View restaurant at the very top of the hillside resort and enjoy the view. The evening we were there the firepits were all alight to take the chill out of the air and the view is amazing as the sun goes down against the mountains. The day we were ready to leave there was a problem with our flight and we had to spend another night in Pheonix. They said they would match the rate we had paid for the previous three nights, which I thought was pretty amazing as I know the rates had gone up from the time we booked. As it turned out, we decided to stay closer to the airport as our flight the next day turned out to be very early in the morning; however, the fact that they were willing to extend our rate for another night because of our circumstances earns them top marks in my book. Helen knew we were scrambling to rebook flights, etc., and told us to take our time - they extended our check-out for us no problem, no charge. AAA rated this place four star -- I give it a five star rating. We also checked out their sister property at Squaw Peak while there and that place looks equally amazing - they said you could stay at one and play at the other and they even have a shuttle which will take you back and forth. I would highly recommend this hotel for the service, the friendliness of the staff, the golf course, the restaurants, the beauty of the surroundings - there are beautiful fountains everywhere, the beautiful pool areas - with waterfalls and a waterslide. It was an amazing place to call home for three nights. Next time we'll stay longer.

There are a lot of pools which is the real draw for kids. The property is rather large and on a hill side. So as is mentioned elsewhere, there's a bit of walking to expect. There are a number of different rooms: there is a main building which are near the entrance and surround a number of main pools. These seem like the original hotel. One thing to watch out for in this building: The courtyards have fountains in part to cut down on sound echoing. But they turn them off at night and not back on until 7am. However, staff start noisily doing their tasks at 6am, so you can hear a lot of annoying noises. We stayed here on two separate times during our trip. The first time we were 'upgraded' to a presidential suite in one of the hillside buildings. The problem here is that the room while very large, is dated in its decor. And while you have a dining room table and what should be a kitchen...its only got a sink, so there's not much use here unless you are ordering room service (we didn't). The hillside buildings are nice, its very pretty to navigate the winding, narrow roadways between them with their connecting bridges. But parking is a nightmare...do not expect to get a spot near your room, and if you're in a second floor room, you will be doing a bit of climbing. The pools are all heated - sort of. They claim 82 degrees but there were definite variations and in the 70-ish degree weather, only my daughter was enjoying the swimming.

To get to the lobby from our room, we had to take 2 different elevators and a bridge- I like exercise, it was just annoying. But- they will take you anywhere on the grounds in the shuttle if you prefer. As far as I could tell there weren't any great views except from A Different Pointe of View restaurant. The rooms were ok- on the smaller side for a suite. A problem we experienced with the \"motel\" style layout was that you could hear a lot of things happening outside the room- maid carts rolling by and the stray cats making the most awful fighting noises in the middle of the night. The hotel website shows 5 or so places to eat. Actually, there were only 2 open this time of year and A Different Pointe of View is only open for dinner Tues-Sat. However, this restaurant was excellent! Definitely worth going to, even if you aren't staying at the hotel. It was some of the best food and presentation that I have ever had. We would have gone again Sunday, but it was closed. The other open restaurant, Pointe in Thyme, was open for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks. The food was actually pretty good (standard breakfast, lunch and bar food) but the service was always off- even though we went there about 8 times. One time we sat at the almost empty bar for literally 12 minutes while the bartender made absoutely no effort to stop talking about grenadine with other patrons even though he clearly saw us. During meals, a different person came over each time and requests were rarely followed through with. However, they do have $3 happy hour drinks.

The other was the vanity mirror in the bathroom (the one that magnifies your face so that you see every wrinkle and pore) - it was positioned for a 6 foot person, not an average 5\"4 woman. But it wasn't such a big deal, so I didn't ask for another room. The lighting in the bathroom was dim, and when I called the front desk about that, someone came in minutes to change the bulb. We encountered friendly staff wherever we turned. Everyone was very nice and ready to help us make our stay as comfortable as possible. I have nothing negative to say about the resort's staff. The concierge had long hours, so that was a plus. The front desk were always smiling and attentive to your needs. As for parking - I see that was an issue with past reviews. It wasn't an issue for us. First of all, it's not a big deal if you don't find a parking spot right outside your suite. You might find one around the corner. Who cares if you have to walk for 2-3 minutes to your car? And the hotel has FREE valet parking to help you with parking as well. Furthermore, the resort is over 60 acres, so if you don't have a car or don't want to walk around to get somewhere, they have a free shuttle service that is available in minutes to take you wherever you want to go. The pool is very nice with several to choose from, the main being in the Falls area. There is a water slide and a jacuzzi. This hotel has a sister resort, Hilton Squaw Peak Pointe. That resort has a nice pool as well as a slide and a lazy river. YOU ARE ALLOWED TO VISIT THE OTHER HILTON RESORT FOR FREE if you stay at Tapatio Cliffs. We checked out the other premises during one afternoon because we wanted to see the lazy river....it wasn't worth it. It was very nice and relaxing but the current was weak. Either pool area in Tapatio Cliffs and Squaw Peak is acceptable. And I thought the slide was better and faster in Tapatio Cliffs. Phoenix is pretty and so is Scottsdale. Sedona is even better. I would stay in this resort again. The price was decent. The people were kind.

In general, the resort is poorly designed and parking is abysmal. Room furnishings seem to date back to the early 80's (although the room was very clean and the beds very comfortable). They advertise their many pools yet several were closed when we were there, even though there was near-record warmth. Getting to the few open pools involved hiking up and down very hilly terrain. The television was out for most of the first day we were there. Our phone was out for two days (and only fixed after we complained twice). Unfortunately, so was the one elevator in our building for hours at a time, multiple times. In my late 50's, I had considerable difficulty not only marching up and down four flights of stairs, but try carrying luggage up and down! My biggest issue was that the front desk manager did not seem to care one whit. In fact, initially she did not even respond to our issues (we were told she would call us - she never did). We were ultimately offered a small amount of 'resort credit' which we could not apply to the room cost (we had asked for room compensation for all the issues we encountered). As we already had dining plans elsewhere, we ended up using it in the gift shop to purchase a very overpriced sweatshirt.

This time, less so. First, check-in. I was assigned to Room 1114, but instead of simply giving me a map or explaining how to ge there, the girl at the front desk directed me to the concierge (despite no one being in line behind me). This led to some confusion. I told the concierge 1114, and showed her the key card brochure with the room number written there. She said 1014. I said again 1114, and again she said 1014. OK, I thought, there is no room 1114, maybe I'm in room 1014. The concierge pointed it out on the map, I walked through the rain to the car, drove to the parking, walked through the rain with my luggage to 1014 and tried the key. Nope. So I walked around a little looking for 1114. No room by that number. So I headed back to the lobby, a lot wetter. Apparently 1114 is actually up on the hill behind the resort. So I headed back out, drove up the hill and found the room this time. Guidance for the hotel: there's no reason the front desk can't point people to their rooms. Also, how about numbering rooms in a way that makes sense? I tried to make a spa appointment for that afternoon. The website says that they close at 7. Nope, I was told, they actually close at 5 during the winter. Not cool. The website (as of 12/10) is still incorrect. At other Hiltons, as a HHonors member, the internet charges have been waived. Not at Tapatio Cliffs. $11.95/day. So I connected via BlackBerry modem instead. So annoying when hotels charge for internet. The room was nice with a comfy bed. No complaints there.

If you pay significantly less than a five star property and manage your expectations accordingly, you will be pleased with Tapatio Cliffs. PLUSSES: 1) VIEW. I requested the best view possible and got it. Keep in mind you can not be at the top of a cliff and not expect steep terrain. I read previous reviews that complained about this. You have two options....stay near the base of the resort OR use the cart service where you can be picked up and driven to and fro in a golf cart. 2) ALL SUITES. These are true suites meaning the living area and bedroom can be completely shut off from each other and have the bath in between. Bed and bedding very comfortable . 3) FITNESS. Fitness center has very new equipment. There are nine pools, tennis courts, 8 hole golf course, horseback riding and hiking trails all on property or property adjacent. Again one could get plenty of exercise just walking the property as it is built into the cliffs. 4) SERVICE. Every staff member was friendly and accommodating. Every request was honored without fail. This made up for any shortcomings in the property itself. MINUSES: 1) DINING choices. All of the restaurants and snack areas were not open during Thanksgiving week. Apparently this is a seasonal thing and you may want to check before you book. The dining we did partake on property was good to very good but maybe not exceptional. We did not eat at the fine dining establishment on property but the views alone merit a visit. 2) FACILITIES. Everything in the suite and on property seemed to be clean and well cared for. Again if you are going to compare this to a five star property you will nitpick the slight \"wear\" as noted in previous reviews. This is not a glamorous but a comfortable property. Lastly, we got an amazing deal on Travelzoo. The room rate was only $99, $50 of which was credited back DAILY to spend on anything except the room rate and tax. This covered our breakfast daily and some lunches. By bringing a few snacks, sodas and tea bags from the grocery, we were able to stretch that credit quite a bit. Also, opt infor the RESORT VALUE PACKAGE at check-in. For $2.25 per day per suite, this covers the fitness center, a daily newspaper, local phone calls and more.

At check-in were only young people and, although the young girl was friendly, I didn\u2019t get automatically an upgrade for being Diamond HHonors! I find it always less when I have to ask for it, especially in a Hilton hotel. After some arguments (no, they were not sold out as I had been told, I had checked the Internet that morning and all rooms were still available), I got not exactly an upgrade, but could choose a suite with falls view. It was quiet in the resort and we could park next to our room. The falls are behind and could not be seen from our window, but we had a view from our balcony on a large pool site. The suite is great, it has a living room with working desk and chair, sofa and easy chairs, a bathroom with the sink outside and a bedroom of a proper size with a balcony. All furniture was good, the carpet clean and the sheets and towels were of good quality. In the room we also had a Lavazzo coffeemaker and a mini-bar, from which we took some items out to store our own things (and placed them all back when we left). It was very quiet at the major pool area and we had a nice and relaxing afternoon. There are plenty of sun beds to choose from and enough towels were available. In the evening we called the shuttle bus and had to wait about 10 minutes before we were picked up. We wanted to have a drink in the Pointe of View bar to see the magnificent view, but unfortunately, this location was not open for the public that evening, due to a private party. We found Pointe of View restaurant too expensive to have dinner so we had to call the shuttle again to bring us to the other restaurant Pointe in Time. The food in this restaurant was excellent and reasonable priced, we made a good choice. We walked back up a hill to our suite and my sister and I didn\u2019t find that hard to do. For my Diamond Status I was given two vouchers for breakfast at Pointe in Time. This is one of the very few Hiltons that don\u2019t have a breakfast buffet. The items are very pricey, be also aware that as soon you sit on your table, a waitress comes with coffee and juice. Accepting this will mean that half of the amount on your voucher is already taken! We found this out when we got the bill and made a protest. Being a Diamond Member for some years with 40-60 stays annually, I never ever had to pay in any other Hilton and there I had much and much more to choose from than here. Some days after our stay I found out that they had put an extra amount off my AMEX account. Since I couldn\u2019t find an e-mail address of this hotel I wrote to the HHonors desk if they could find out why they charged me this amount. After some time I got a message that it was for items of the mini-bar. We didn\u2019t use anything, so I wrote back, that we didn\u2019t take anything out of the fridge, that we only rearranged the setting because we had own items in during our stay. Then I got a message that the amount would be taken of my account and so it did. Because it was a quiet period we paid about 100 US plus tax for staying in this hotel. Although I had some remarks, I would go again without any doubts if the rates of other Hiltons in the Phoenix area are on the high side and are very competitive here again.

The elevator to the second floor was disgusting, the room had very little light coming in and the only view we had was of the parking lot on one side and the smaller overcrowded pool on the other side! Also the amount of noise coming from the pool was insane, there wasn't going to be much relaxing going on here. This room had the feel of a cheap apartment not a resort, so, I went back to the front desk and asked for another room! There was no room available but I was told that if we waited about 1-2 hrs there would be one available farther up the hill so we waited. In 1-2 hrs I received a call that a room was available and returned and picked up our room key. This room was as far up the hill as you could get, right below the different point of view restaurant. The parking for our room was at a steep angle and the feel was much better of this location. It seemed cleaner, newer and much more peaceful! No overcrowded swimming pools nearby and a great view! Our room was full of light, a peaceful hallway with interesting plants out front and a beautiful view from a large patio in the back. Our Suite had a flat screen tv, fridge, bar, desk, and comfy couch in the living room and a Comfy King bed & standard tv in the fairly large bedroom. The Bathroom was a bit weird, the vanity was located on one side of the hall, plenty of space on the granite countertop but a noisy air conditioner vent overhead... the shower/tub combo and toilet were on the other side in a pretty cramped space, when you open the door it nearly touches the toilet. It was really clean but could use some new fixtures in the shower/tub, they were really covered in hard water. The view from 'Different Point of View' is great, you can see downtown Phoenix from here. We didn't eat at the restaurant, just took a drive up to look around. We didn't do room service either so I can't comment on that. We ate out while staying here and it was quite a drive to find something.

I grew up on Phoenix and the Pointe was always someplace nice but I think maybe it is past its prime although the issues we encountered could easily be remedied. Pros: 1. It is very centrally located and convenient to two freeways and downtown. 2. The location itself is beautiful. 3. The pool seemed nice (but a little small). We did not use the pool but I did check it out. 4. We were able to get a Presidential Suite for a very reasonable price and the room itself was VERY large and more than met our needs. 5. Bell staff & concierge was otherwise very nice & knowledgeable. For the price we paid I guess I really should not complain much but it certainly was not a 4 star hotel. Cons/Issues: 1. We checked in at 9PM. The hotel is very convoluted and confusing. The bell desk told us the wrong building to go to and we drove around for 15 minutes in the dark (lugged our suitcases and 2 tired kids up and down stairs) before we found our room. Room numbering is completely erratic. (ie Room 2164 is in building 18 but 2163 is in building 20) 2. When we entered the room the desk chair was askew, the chairs for the table were on the table and the bathtub was half filled with water and there was a soaking wet towel in there. My daughter asked \u201cwhy is the carpet wet?\u201d I took off my shoes and realized that the carpet in the bedroom area was soaked. I don\u2019t mean damp, I mean squishy, sloshy soaked. I called the front desk, who seemed completely unconcerned by the cause of the water and offered to send up a fan. I told them explicitly not to worry about it that night but that we\u2019d be out all day the next day and to have it fixed. I explicitly stated that I had 2 small kids I needed to get into bed as it was nearly midnight their time. My husband noted that the carpet under the bed was dry and that there was a carpet cleaning machine outside another room down the way. I figured someone didn\u2019t finish their job. At 10PM a worker knocked on the door and asked if he could come finish cleaning the carpet. I sent him away. Please remember, we checked in at 9PM, a full 5 hours after check-in time but our room was obviously not ready, yet we were sent to the room anyway. The carpet was dry by the next morning. 3. For 3 days the neighbors wine glasses sat empty on the walkway railing outside our door and housekeeping never took them. 4. Our room was VERY far away from the Falls pool. It was literally a hike down there and we were closer than a lot of other rooms. So if you're looking to enjoy the pool be prepared to walk (it is set in the side of a mountain so by \"hike\" I'm not kidding). There are smaller pools around the hotel as well. 5. Our room clearly was not part of the recent renovation as there was plenty of peeling paint, peeling wallpaper, stains on the table, peeling stain on the table, and closet doors that didn\u2019t work right. 6. Last but not least, I was SHOCKED that Disney channel was only available On Demand as a pay channel. For kids there was only Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon for free so there was nothing age appropriate for my 6 year old to watch as she wound down for bed at 8-9PM, as both have gone pretty adult by that time. Seriously, if you\u2019re going to tout yourselves as a family friendly resort, at least have some family friendly TV available for free.

And, the vents are up above the doorways, so they blow directly on the bed and couch. I thought the cabanas at the pool were a nice option, but the water slide wasn't open most of the time we were there. Service by the f&b attendants at the pool was spotty. Had a really nice gift shop with an unusually large variety of items, not just the usual things. I, too, find it ridiculous that Hilton charges for internet usage. Just because other hotels do doesn't mean it is OK. If Motel 6 can provide free internet, Hilton should be able to also. Unfortunately, it was \"restaurant week\" in town when we were there, so the Different Pointe of View was extremely crowded with people looking for bargain food. And, they had a weird menu to accommodate those people--part prix fixe and part not. My companions ordered from this prix fixe portion of the menu and all thought it was terrible (we all eat out at high end restaurants often).

We are a family of 4 (16 & 11 year old kids) and have travelled to the Phoenix area many times and always in August ,we look for a decent hotel with good facilities and at a reasonable price and the Tapatio certainly ticked all the boxes for us. Suite was in an excellent location (Building 8) overlooking the Falls pools and with views of the mountains, was clean and well appointed with plenty of storage space. Our 16 year old took the sofa bed in the living area and slept really well. We asked about a fridge and were told to break the seal on the mini bar, remove non perishables and leave them where inventory could see them and we could fill with our own items. No problem and no charge, so don't know why others were charged. All chargable items were clearly marked. During the week this hotel is idyllic but at weekends is like a zoo, I don't mind people having a laugh and making some noise ,after all we are all on vacation ,but have to agree that Management should address the issue of people eating and drinking while sitting/standing in the pools. Not only is this unhygenic but just looks so tacky. The second half of our stay we found ourselves without a car (don't ask!!!) but thanks to Brian, Ray and the Bell desk team this was not as much of a problem as it could of been. One call to the desk and the hotel shuttle was outside our suite to take us to the local supermarket, shops and restaurants. Thanks guys we really did appreciate it. The staff in the golf pro shop were great, don't know if it was because it was quite or not but tennis courts, raquets, balls and table tennis equipment were all free and security even switched on court lights for us when it got dark. We booked golf lessons with the golf pro - Charlie - for our son, he was just brilliant. He taught him so much and allowed him to play on a course that was so beautiful most lads his age could only dream of playing. So overall for a family holiday I would recommend this hotel and we would definately return. Would I stay here if I was on a romantic getaway with my partner, no probably not, but then if his idea of a special treat was to book somewhere for $75 a night, I might not stay with him either!!!

We took advantage of the $79/night rate. Yes this is a very touristy hotel. It should not be confused with a high-style resort, that is not what this is. No high-style resort would have a rate of less than $100/night. There were a lot of people, but they have eight pools so it wasn't impossible to find some privacy. We hung out at the adult pool which was not that highly populated. It was laid back during the day, but does tend to get a little wild/risque at night. Yes there is a bee issue, but it wasn't that uncomfortable. They come and go. It is something that should be addressed though. It's not fun having bees swarm you while you are trying to enjoy the sun. Had a late dinner at the Mexican restaurant the first night. The food there was OK. We ate lunch Saturday at the main pool at Cascade. The prices were a tad-high but the food was good. We had fun watching all the different kinds of people, and all the kids running around. Parking is a bit of the nightmare, but we knew this going in having read other reviews. We got a spot in front of our building and fortunately didn't have to move our car for the first full day. We did go out in the city on Saturday night, and as a result there was no spots available when we returned at about 1 a.m. Had to park the car behind the conference building and walk. The view at the Different Pointe of View restaurant at the top of the resort was worth the price in itself. You have to go at sunset. There are views of the city lights on one side, and sunset on the mountains on the other. Don't think you can get this type of view anywhere else. Had a great breakfast Sunday morning at the Pointe in Tyme Grille before departing. We liked our room. Had a second floor balcony overlooking the entrance to the hotel. Used the fridge for our own beverages, but didn't not drink or eat any of the over-priced beer and snacks that the hotel provided. I don't feel like there were any hidden fees. We knew going in that the internet would not be free, and they told us at the front desk at check-in that there was a cost involved with the fitness center. Who needs a fitness center though when you can get a nice workout hiking one of several trails in the area, and walking or running up and down the various inclines of the resort drives.

We kept such good memories from that first stay (partly due tot the free upgrade to a Presidential Suite...) that we decided on our third trip to spend again a night in this hotel. But... there will definitely not be a third time! Upon our arrival on a Friday afternoon in July it's queuing to find a parking place and again waiting in a long line to check in. Front Desk is very friendly, but no upgrade this time since the resort is sold out. The doorkeeper prohibits the use of a luggage trolley. These may onlu be used by their staff members. After 15 minutes waiting after a staff member, we are finally allowed to tak a trolley and bring our luggage to our room (provided we bring the trolley back to the main entrance). We received a room in the main building, right above the lobby. The room is a suite with a separate sitting room with beautiful furniture, giant flatscreen, desk and (sealed and highly priced) minibar. Even putting your own drinks in the minibar will cost you money....And don't be so naive to think that the bottles of water on the cupboard would be complimentary. A double door separates the sitting room from the sleeping and washing part of the suite (with another flatscreen and a balcony overlooking the parking lot). Our room also overlooks one of the inner patios with a fountain and a swimming pool. We are surprised and upset (from an hygienical point of view) to see people eating by the poolside (some being in the pool and putting their plate of Mexican food on the poolrim), others drinking beer and margaritas in the pool or even smoking inside the pool. Unbelievable! For the rest of the day (and this until 10,30 pm) a few adult couples booze one beer or margarita after another, causing incredible noise nuisance in this patio. Very unpleasant for other customers, but nobody of the hotel staff seems to bother about it. The large swimming pools by the falls look like the heart of a cheap mass holiday resort with loud music, hustle and bustle. Where the resort looked 3 years ago as a luxurious, soothing and comfortable Hilton resort, it now seems more to have become a crowdy mass holiday resort for faimilies with children. If not for the excellent dinner and superb view from the Different Point of View-restaurant, we would totally regret to have chosen this hotel.

Otherwise this property needs an update before I'd recommend it to anyone else. The \"good\": (1) main pool areas (esp. the one with the water slide) can be fun for families, but sometimes get very crowded. (2) the cabana area near the main pool is a nice place to have a drink on a hot day, with a good selection of beers on tap. (3) Lookout Mountain golf course is a (mostly) forgiving desert course, and is right next to the hotel. (4) Some reviews have expressed frustration about staff but my experience with the staff here was great - everyone was very friendly and attentive. (5) \"Pointe in Time\" restaurant is nice inside, but the food is mediocre at best and a touch expensive. The bad: (1) Rooms are long in the tooth and the air conditioner only went down to 80 degrees when it was 110 outside. Couldn't sleep very well as a result. (2) Shuttle service at the property is spotty. After a round of golf I waited for a half hour before getting a ride up the hill. And after golfing in 100+ degree weather I wasn't walking. To be fair I never went to the restaurant on top of the hill here, which many reviewers seem to have liked.

I thought it would be a nice birthday getaway for my boyfriend's 12 year old son. I saw on the Tapatio Cliffs website that they had a great family friendly pool with a waterslide. The 2 room suites started at $80, but I had the option of adding a $50 food credit for an additional $40. I also was able to \"request\" an early check in at noon. So this was my plan. My boyfriend, his son, his son's friend, and I would bring snacks and drinks to keep in our room, check in early, hang poolside most of the day, order pizza from Pizza Hut at night, then use our food credit to buy a nice breakfast at one of the resort restaurants. Didn't really work out that way. My boyfriend went to check in at 1230. (By the way, parking for check in was awful.) The hotel clerk said check in wasn't until 3. My boyfriend showed her our confirmation we printed out that said we requested an early check in. She emphasized it was only a request and wasn't a guarantee. Luckily, a room just became available. She apologized about the check in requests and admitted that the website is very misleading and people get angry all the time. She gave him the dining voucher, but told him it could only be used for today, not for breakfast the next day. I called an agent when I first made the reservation and she told me I could use it any time of the day at any restaurant. Mislead again. So we drove to our room and couldn't find any parking by our room. My boyfriend had to drop us off with the stuff and go find a parking spot that was a 5 minute walk (more like hike- very hilly there) away. The room was nice. It was tastefully decorated. I have seen the suites a couple of years ago and they were kind of tacky- southwestern decorated. But they have seen to undergone some renovations and the suite was very nice. There was a bedroom for my boyfriend and I too sleep in with a VERY comfortable bed, and a living area with a pull out couch for his son and his friend. And a TV in both rooms. There was an alarm radio with an Ipod dock which was nice, until I learned the maximum volume is very low and I could barely hear it. My boyfriend set up his laptop to check his email for work and discovered you have to pay for internet. Another good thing was the view from our balcony. It overlooked the main pool area as well as some desert preserve and view of North Phoenix. Very pretty. The only thing that sucked about the balcony, was the suite below us that had (not joking) about 5 adults and 8 kids in it. Thats kind of ghetto. C'mon people. Get 2 suites. We went to the pool area which was very crowded. I don't mind the crowds and I like kids, however many parents weren't supervising their children and some of the kids were quite annoying. We tried going to the Hidden Falls Pool which was smaller and more secluded. Which was great until a family came with their 10 kids and let them misbehave, splash us, and run into us with their pool floats. We went back to the main pool. We took a break and went inside our suite and watched a movie on HBO. It was nice that the four of us sat comfortably in the living area while we watched the movie. Dinner time was an adventure. We planned on going to Cascade Cafe, the poolside casual restaurant, for dinner to use our voucher. I looked at the menu previously in the day and saw a couple of things I can eat on the menu, since I'm a vegetarian. When we got to Cascades Cafe, they did not offer their normal menu, only a limited buffet for $12 for adults, $8 for kids. The only thing vegetarian on the menu was curly fries. I wasn't about to pay $12 for curly fries. We walked to two other restaurants on property and only found nachos at the mexican restaurant for me to eat. So we went back to our room and decided to use our voucher for room service. At least they have salads and pizzas on that menu. We ordered a couple pizzas, wings, and chips and salsa. The pizza was mediocre. I heard the wings were good. So overall- Pros- location is pretty. Nice balcony view. Nice rooms with comfortable beds. Most employees were nice and helpful. Cons- parking, limited menus, overpriced food and drinks, MISLEADING WEBSITE, overpopulated pool area with annoying crowd I would go again, except I would stick to the $80 rate and not get a voucher.

It is definitely an older complex, but they have done a nice job maintaining the property. Our suite was stylishly decorated, very clean and functional. The pool complex was a very happening scene for teens. The resort offers a Friday family night with Wii set ups in several cabanas by the pool. The kids, young and old, enjoyed the interactive games. There was a pool volleyball game going on with various groups all evening in one pool while the other pool was a more relaxing area. There are also other pools in the complex, but we didn't have the time to check them out. I wish they would provide free internet access in the rooms.

He asked if I could travel with him to Phoenix. I did. Not wanting to make the trip all gloomy, my father wanted a nice place to stay. After using Yahoo's trip planner, I found this resort hotel to be reasonably priced. Because the hotels don't look quite the same as their online pictures, I used Google map's street view to scout the area the condition of the exterior and called Hilton reservations. After talking with the reservationist for a bit, he recommended I call the hotel and ask for a special offer. I thought sweet, inside information. But, the clerk and her supervisor stated they had no special. The clerk was not very friendly or warm. This type of attitude always bothers me. A guest should feel a personal connection with the hotel. It even makes the clerks job easier as the guest is less likely to attack someone they know on a friendly basis. I called central reservations back because the reservationist informed me he of a falls view suite at no additional cost - all their rooms are suites. When we arrived the location and property met my expectations. We received the same non-warm service from the desk. The clerk explained the bellman would show us to our room. When we went to the bell desk, he pulled a complicated map, drew an X and gave us brief directions. With no line at the desk, I don't know why the desk clerk could not have shown us. We got lost. The property is spread out and the roads to rooms are narrow - imagine streets of Rome - and parking sucks. The property has a lot of charm and is nestled against a mountain. Our room was a falls view suite. However, the only view we had was a partial view of the pool. A tree blocked most of the view. I'm not sure how they can call these fall view rooms as the falls start behind the view and end directly below. It\u2019s more of a pool view room. However, it was still nice. I quickly realized the AC was not working and probably had not for the previous guest as the thermostat was set to the lowest setting. Maintenance arrived promptly and determined it take a few hours to fix. He called the desk and arranged for another room. He got housekeeping to rush the room and got us in. During our move, the front desk called to say they were getting us a new room and someone would be by with new keys once it was cleaned. Maintenance was WAY ahead of them. He was very engaging and offered the level of service I would expect from the desk. I can't remember his name (tall guy white guy, was in the service). Since he was getting off duty soon, he left us with Roman, the other maintenance guy. Roman was just was engaging and went above and behind to help us move to a room a couple of doors down. I never expect great service from the maintenance staff, but these guys were awesome. The rooms are more mini-suites than they are suites. You have a sitting room and a bedroom. In between, is in the vanity area and bathroom. Both the bedroom and sitting room have flat screens TVs with pay-per-view movies and games. There is a fully stocked mini-bar. Nice, but it left no more for any of our own items. Housekeeping seems inconsistent. Our first room had no robe and was missing a note pad and pen in the bedroom. The rooms were clean otherwise and in good condition. I was very comfortable in this room. There is an alarm clock radio with an audio jack for an iPod or other mp3 player. There is high-speed internet in the room for $11.95 a day. The wireless in the lobby requires you to purchase additional service. The second smelled moldy and at times the vanity area smelled like someone just used the toilet. I think the \"crawl space\" around the AC unit is starting to mold. I noticed mold in the \"crawl space\" of the first room when they were checking the AC unit. The resort has four restaurants, one at the top of the mountain with a view of the city, one that is sort of a clubhouse, a Cantina, and a poolside cafe. There is also a Starbucks in the lobby. The cafe was closed during our stay and the mountain top sounded more romantic and pricey than my dad and I cared for. For lunch we ate the clubhouse, Pointe in Thyme. We both ordered the Shrimp and avocado salad. While the shrimp was not fresh in the least bit, it was a very good salad. They weren\u2019t large portions and we paid $12.95 for the lunch menu salad. The bartender was not the most professional person, but good enough. The second day we stopped in, a young man at the hostess counter was very friendly and offered to call the property\u2019s driver to shuttle us back to our room. I really liked the idea of the caf\u00e9 by the pool. I could really see this resort as a nice winter getaway where you can go swimming, relax by the pool, have the scenery of the falls, and feel comfortable never leaving. There are many different pools scattered throughout the property. The pool by the falls has a water volley net and many private poolside cabanas free of charge. This would be a good property for a large travel group. Because we were in Phoenix for a funeral, we did not get to enjoy the property as we should have. We paid $139 a night plus tax with no hidden resort fees. I thought it was good deal considering the business class hotels were only $20-40 cheaper.

The Falls psuedo-waterpark has plenty to offer all ages, including chair-side beverage service and cafe with cooling mist-ers.

We spent the days, and most evenings sightseeing, and so although we had intended to - we never used the large pool area. The larger pool complexes were impressive. We walked through a few times - and it seems they were used but never over-crowded. We did enjoy two of the smaller pools nearer to the top of the hill - where our room was. We enjoyed the resort and the layout, however, for someone attending a convention - I understand the negative comments regarding the walking required. The resort is spread out and requires walking up and down. Also the layout of the walkways can be confusing unless you study the resort map. This resulted in many people simply walking on the narrow streets - which creates a saftely hazard and requires drivers and pedestrians alike to use caution inside the resort. Also, in the summer months, I can see where the heat could become a factor in the walking required. The use of the fitness center and internet were additional fees, not so much to my liking as I would ceratinly have expected the fitness center to be included in the room fee. You could get those for a $2 -$3 daily resort fee ... so not really a big deal. There was an erroneous fitness center fee on our bill, which they removed. We got the rooms for $99 on the internet via \"nameyour own price\" - so the value for a resort was one of the main benefits. For slightly more than the price of two star hotels, we were in a nice resort. We had a nice stay and we would return. No big complaints.

The image that a presidential suite conjures up is usually plush -- this was very far from that. The suite, bed, bath - the whole suite - were very dated and not special at all. Light switches falling off, dilapidated paint and poor air conditioning were features. Parking was at a premium with limited space. The small and sharp rocks that make up the landscape nicely grated my son's leg into cheese. Room service was way overpriced and the server had to make three trips to get it right. On both of the times we ordered - shame on us for trying twice. The resort pool - while nice and clean - wasn't special enough to make us go back there again. The one bright spot was the person that checked us in; despite the reservation snafu he was professional, personable and very customer oriented. I remain a Hilton fan, but will avoid the Tapatio (and the Squaw Peak and airport Hilton).

First off, my fiance is a Diamond member and we had our room upgraded to an Ambassador Suite this time. Wow! This room was the size of a small apartment in New York and was decorated beautifully! The bed was so soft and comfy I didn't want to get up in the mornings and slept really hard at night! The room was right by the adult pool so there were no screaming kids running around. Very quiet and very calm. There are a couple of other pools at the resort, one being the big one with a water slide and water falls. That's the kiddie pool. It's also nice there, but if you don't have kids with you then the adult pool is the way to go. The staff was helpful and respectful and when we needed something they always did their best to satisfy. The only thing bad I can say about this resort is that if you don't have transportation then you'll be stuck paying high prices for food and watered down drinks by the pool and at the other restaurants around the resort.

There are lots of kids in the Falls Water Village so if you're looking for something more low key the adult pool might better suit you, otherwise it's great for families. We also rented a poolside cabana which is a nice treat. The rooms are nice because they are all spacious suites but the decor is standard and I thought the bathroom was a bit cramped and run down. We went to the Point in Thyme restaurant (the more upscale Different Pointe of View was closed for a wedding reception). The restaurant decor has an upscale feel to it and is very dark. The others in my party enjoyed the ribs that they got. My mother and I got the blackened prime rib which we were not happy with, it was really fatty and did not have that flavorful taste that prime rib usually has. The kitchen was backed up, so don't be in a rush when you go here! We didn't mind though. We also went to the buffet brunch at a Point in Thyme which we enjoyed. The hotel is built into a mountain so there are some great sights to see if you walk around the hotel and use some of the walking trails.

Not exceptional. Not horrible. Just good. Check out and check in was efficient. Staff were helpful. The suites were okay -- nothing great -- but nothing unexpected or unadvertised, either. They are just as stated on the website. Pretty simple -- a small living room, a small bedroom and a bathroom in the middle, with the tub/toilet on one side and the sink/vanity on the other. The \"wet bar' was not wet i.e. no sink. It would be much appreciated if they would abandon the mini bar concept and give us an emply fridge and a microwave. We did not have a microwave which was disappointing. We emptied part of the mini-bar to store our own supplies. There was no charge for that, but I did notice that if you want the hotel to empty the mini-bar they charge $25. The beds were very comfortable and had nice linens. There was one really nice reading light per bed. They were excellent for reading and letting some one else sleep. It would have been nice if there were two per bed, however. There is a nice sized closet in the bedroom. The deck is off the bedroom. Our deck was small and too deep in to the building to ever get much sun. The bathroom was okay, although the shower and tub seemed old and not up to date. At one point, our tub wasn't draining at all, but a call to the front desk resulted in the maintenance man fixing it within an hour. As already stated, the living room was small -- there was a couch (pull out bed), a wicker type chair, and a small (but nice) desk and desk chair, along with a cabinet and a flat screen tv. The cabinet had nice storage. There were also two end/coffee tables that had some weird tin/silver surface but they were okay. In the corner was the bar area, which was functional, but would have been better if it included a microwave and did NOT include ridiculously priced goodies. Maid service was consistent and generally okay as far as surface cleaning. However, they never cleaned under the bed etc. The pools and bar areas were very nice. There are a lot of extra little sitting/tannning areas throughout this resort that you can find if you go exploring. If you want a quiet place to tan, with no pool, there is a big deck off the 5th floor, just overlooking the \"Adult Pool\". Very nice and very rarely used. The food in the cafe by the falls pool was good. The service there was good. We rented a cabana for $75 one day and are not sure if it was worth it. You get a tv, phone, fridge and a cabana with pool furniture. You also get a waiter to order food and drinks. It seemed a little pricey but we did it anyways. The basetball court area was nice too, for the kids, and there is a big sundeck there. The tennis courts were convenient but again, you had to pay to use them, or to rent equipment. We didn't golf. We had brunch at the main restaurant by the adult pool one day. It was okay (but again, nothing spectacular). That is why I say this place was just \"good\". \"Good\", not \"exceptional\". Nothing about this place was \"exceptional\". I found the parking was alright. We always found a spot. Yes, we had to walk a bit, but it wasn't terrible. There are elevators, so when you have luggage or a lot to carry, you don't have to use the stairs. We were with our 11 year old son, and for part of our trip, 3 adult children, our brother in law and his adult daughter. Our adult kids found lots to do at night -- there was a wedding and they met people from the wedding party. Our 11 year old enjoyed the pool but would have had more fun if he had a friend with him. Generally speaking, all staff was friendly and easy to deal with. One word of caution is the website. It is very confusing as to which part of the website pertains to Squaw Peak and which part pertains to Tapatio Cliffs. In fact, my brother in law booked at the wrong property through the web site. So be careful -- ensure that you are getting information for the right property. The internet was wired and $11.95 a day. That was a bit of a pain, but we knew about it in advance. There was a fee to use the fitness centre etc. but again, they are pretty up front about that.

However, prior to that we stayed there every year for over 6 years and I worked in Phoenix back in the 80's and always stayed at this resort. However, when I was there in the 80's I had no idea how to spell GOLF let alone play the game. This resort is continuously trying to get better. The last time we were there (two years ago+) the entire place was painted white. Now they have made over every building to blend more into the desert and have nice earth tones on the outside while upgrading each suite. Yes, this resort is a true suite only resort. For the price you get a bedroom, living room and bathroom. That is the lowest of the low where some rooms have even more. The one negative I have about the place is the same I have had for twenty years. The parking and getting to the room from your car. I feel like you are in the back streets of Italy or England. There is barely enough room to get one car down these \u201clanes\u201d let alone meeting someone nose to nose. You do have to hoof your bags up a set of stairs if you are on one of the buildings' second stories (but that is why they have bell boys). OK negatives all done, let's get to the positives. Staff are awesome, rooms are very comfortable. The restaurants are very warm and comfortable. The Point in Thyme is deep dark wood accents with huge semi-circle booths and tables in the middle with two fireplaces. This is where breakfast is served (buffet or a la carte). You have to try the Arizona eggs benedict, very unusual and very tasty. Also dinner is served in this restaurant and is surprisingly good. The Different Pointe of View is the flagship. Perched on top of lookout mountain it has a panoramic (and that is an understatement) view of the valley. You can drive up there anytime (day or night) and sit in the parking lot and just gaze. Also, there are some trails that start up there which take you even higher. Keep in mind the restaurant is not open Sundays or Mondays. You must go up there at least 30 minutes before your reservation. They have just overhauled the bar on the second floor (the restaurant is on the third floor). What a beautiful bar area and so comfortable. The best thing is the terrace. You go out onto the terrace and you are out overlooking the valley sitting on comfy seats with fire pits a blazing (we were there in February obviously in August there are no fire pits). The vegetation, view, drinks and service make this a wonderful place to just chill out. Once you experience it you will see what I mean. The restaurant manager (Bill) came out to the terrace (which is multi-level and very big) and found us and directed us to our beautiful window front table. We had a very nice meal (beware, the wine is expensive with the best vintage wine priced at $7,000 a bottle). I had a super crab cake and then an awesome Halibut dish, my wife had a beautiful Scallops dish and a very good chicken dish. The staff were awesome as I proceeded to dump a glass of water all over my wife and the table, they were there in an instant and we were moved to an even more romantic table in the corner. (Guys: Hint: dump the water, it worked well)...OK, now to the real reason we really like this resort. The golf course is amazing, the staff again are so cool. This course I do believe is our favorite, you cannot believe the desert around each hole. There is little water but a ton of scrub. This course was in perfect (and I mean perfect) condition last weekend. The fairways look like they are painted with the stripes and the greens are fast and unforgiving. Wait until the 10th tee, check out the view as you are on top of the mountain looking down. Range balls are included. So I have to finish with the best of all. The package deal. If you (and your S.O.) are golfers try this out. Room, breakfast (includes food, tip and taxes) the package says buffet but they are flexible and you can just use the coupon towards any menu item, golf (each day of stay including cart and range balls), one dinner (for two) at Different Pointe of View (they gave us $95 per person for food) including tax, tips (obviously not booze) was an incredible low package price. As I stated earlier, we have been visiting the Pointe for many years and they are really trying to make to make improvements in anyway they can. The only reason for not 5 stars, the parking and hoofing the bags up stairs. It would almost be better if they had a huge off-site parking lot and then gave everyone a golf cart to get around.

We have stayed at the Phoenician, The Hyatt at Gainey Ranch, The Wigwam, etc. Of all those hotels, we often prefer to go to The Tapatio because: 1. wonderfully friendly staff who go out of their way to say hello or to help you out. This includes the check-in staff, the hotel room-service delivery people, the gift shop people and the whole assortment of the people at the golf course (they could consider hiring at least one woman\u2026just to look as if they had an inkling that women can be pros, too). 2. The rooms are outstanding but not huge. There are two rooms in each suit. The first is, of course, the living room. That is separated from the bedroom by an ingenious systems of doors on either side of the bathroom (The bathroom has a pass-through from the living room to the bedroom\u2026basin and mirror on one side, toilet and bath on the other with a door.) which is between the two rooms\u2026one that closes between the living room and the bathroom and one that closes between the bathroom and the bedroom; this allows people in one room to close off the other room but to still use the bathroom. The rooms are newly renovated\u2026I read the earlier comment about what the writer thought were unattractive color schemes. Those colors are the hotel\u2019s keeping up to date\u2026many of the resorts we have stayed at in the greater Phoenix area, have begun to use similar colors. The beds have feather pillows and feather quilts. There is a wet bar and refrigerator in the living room. 2 wide screen t.v.\u2019s. AND\u2026for readers\u2026a first! Adequate lighting by each side of the bed. It is true that not all rooms are created equal. Some rooms don\u2019t have great views (such as in the main building on the right side\u2026 the view is of delivery trucks all day so avoid those rooms). It is a hotel which is built on hillsides (which is part of its charm). If walking is a problem (as noted in one of the earlier reviews) request a room down below. 3. There are several small restaurants and two larger ones. One of the two larger ones is all paneled with mahogany and is very handsome. Good food, reasonably priced for a resort. Great bar. Friendly atmosphere. Then there is their very slick \u201cA Point of View\u201d restaurant with terrific views of Phoenix/Scottsdale. The restaurant has gotten great reviews from food critics. Pricey but that is what a gourmet restaurant costs. 4. You want pools? They\u2019ve got pools. A huge water-wonderland set up with slides, etc. Two smaller pools nearer to the main part of the hotel\u2026rarely busy. One on top of the hill. Fitness center. And here is something outstanding: the hotel does not charge the usual $10-$12 a day \u201cresort fee\u201d which I have come to hate at all hotels. You can buy a special certificate for $2.50 a day for various uses of resort activities\u2026but you don\u2019t have to. Right there you save at least $70.00 a week. 5. GOLFERS! Listen up. The course is terrific. It is kept in first-class condition (with the exception of the 2nd hole\u2019s green\u2026not sure why they haven\u2019t attended to that). The course has been called \u201cthe Phoenix areas best kept secret.\u201d The staff was very accommodating. The course climbs up and up until the 9th (at which point you are 3 miles from the clubhouse) where you can see for miles in either direction.

Mine was obviously remodeled, so the furniture was fresh, stylish, and the basic king-bed suite I had was comparable in size to a large Marriott Residence Inn or Hilton Embassy Suites room. Kudos to the room! The property itself, however, is very dated. The buildings look quite worn, and the property has a very claustrophobic feel because the buildings are situated so close to each other. The streets going around the property between the buildings are so narrow that only one car can pass by, and since cars must parallel park along the road in many locations, squeezing through is a harrowing experience. Like other reviewers, I found the food prices excessive compared to most hotels at this price-point, although the room service staff was very quick, friendly, and attentive. To be fair, I came to this hotel based on the pictures I saw on the Hilton web site, so it was my fault for not doing more research. Because I expected a new, state-of-the-art property, my expectations were not met once I got to the location and realized how old it is. I felt like it had a rather dark and dreary feel to it; it didn't have the new and clean look that I've become accustomed to in other parts of Phoenix. Because the room was so nice, it balanced out my overall impression of the property, but I definitely won't return for a second stay or recommend it to my friends.", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice\u201d", "Author": "smcalifornia1", "ReviewID": "UR21749654", "Content": "We just returned from Pointe Hilton and found it to be a wonderful place to stay.

It was an extra $75 charge for me. Although the resort adverstises many restaurants, only two were open. There was nothing inexpensive and I paid $17 for a cheeseburger. The resort is not within walking distance of anything, so I paid a hotel employee through the conceirge service to take me to the closest supermarket and pharmacy. He was very nice and waited for me so I could get reasonably priced snacks and drinks for the week. The rooms were fabulous with terraces, nice two room suites and plenty of room. There was a mini bar in my suite with typical minibar prices. The elegant restaurant at the top of the hill was wonderful, attentive staff, nice food and a shuttle to your room. Beautiful view. That was a bonus. Another interesting point, I had a very early departure one morning so I went to the desk and settled my bill the night before. When I pulled up my bill a week later, there was an additonal minibar charge of over $50------ If I had not called, my employer would have paid for that or given me a lot of grief about some thing I didnt do.

Overall this trip exceeded our expectations. Here are some high points: - Room set up was great for our family of 3 (my son is almost 2). There were three distinct parts- family room, bathroom pass through, master bedroom with plenty of room to walk around the pack&play/crib. - Our location on the property was ideal. First floor, facing the family pool, steps from The Falls. Our rooms were 1045/1046. They were back to back and not adjoining as we requested but in the end it didn't matter. I would HIGHLY suggest this building for families still using strollers or anyone that doesn't want to hike. The downside is you dont get a view from your room and no real balcony. - We got a crib, refrigerator and microwave (pay $15 for the stay for each of the last two items). We shopped at Safeway about 1/2 mile north of the property and ate breakfast and lunch in our room every day before putting my son down for a nap. Saved a ton of money. We dined out at night. - We brought our portable DVD player on the flight and the plug which allowed us to play my son's favorites on the nice flat screen in the living room when we were in the room. -Overall this seems like a great time to travel to the resort. The weekend was somewhat busy with a couple of weddings but no issue finding chairs around the pool. On the weekdays we were the only one in the pool until around 11am when a couple of others joined us. - The Falls pool was perfect for our little guy. The graduated entrance allowed him to play safely while we were able to wade a little deeper or sit down to keep cool. Better than a baby pool as we could all enjoy it together. -While my husband & son were sleeping I hiked every morning. It was wonderful and easy to access from the hotel area near the pool. -We did actually order room service twice and surprisingly it was affordable based on what we were eating. The kids menu is $5-$6 items and good. We got a pizza and it was good and $13-15. I got a open face steak sandwhich for $15 as well. Other items on the menu like drinks and dinner meals were outrageous. Kids breakfast at point in time was also a deal- my parents took my son so I cant comment on the adult food. My only complaints: -The directions from the website take you from the airport on 51 to Northern and then you drive through a really unattractive & rough part of town to get to the hotel. I would advise driving further to Cactus and going to the hotel that way. -The AC went out one day/night but the night manager was especially helpful in getting us a room for the evening in another part of the hotel with working AC and not having us move rooms entirely. In general for the $141 we paid a night I though the value was outstanding. My parents want to return next year at the same time. One other note: I am a huge fan of the Willow Stream Spa at the Fairmont Princess and would suggest if you are looking for a great spa experience I would go there for 1/2 day and get a treatment, workout, relax at their pool, spa lunch and leave the kids home.

After much searching and review reading we chose the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort. We booked for a 3 day weekend. They were having a summer special $99.95 per night. We arrive on Friday about 5pm to check in. The front desk lady was nice and friendly but the lobby was over run by children jumping all over the furniture and a big crowd of teens. I gave the desk clerk my credit card. She said oops your card isn't being accepted. Well the cost of my 3 night stay was only supposed to be $333.00 and my credit card had plenty of credit on it. I gave her my debit card and we were registered and on our way. Later I checked my debit card online banking and discovered they put a hold on my debit card for $1200. I find this highly ridiculous. I understand and expect a hotel to put a hold on your card to cover incidentals, however my room was $99 a night for 3 nights, I don't see how a deposit 4 items the amount of the cost of the room was justified. We requested a king size bed. It was just me and the hubby. When we finally found a parking space, walked down a steep incline and found the building our room was in we opened the door to find they gave us a room with two full size beds in it. That was disapointing. Also within about 20 mins of turning the AC on there was a loud annoying clunking noise coming from the sink. We assumed it was some sort of water leak from the AC draning into sink pipe. It was so loud and annoying. We were already starting to get a little frustrated. We went back to the lobby and it was even more crowded than before with children, teenagers, and two weddings and their guests. We decided to walk around the property and take a look then go get something to eat and talk to the desk when we came back. Well.. this property is located on a mountain and the suites are built all up and down the mountain side. You can not walk anywhere without climbing up a mountain path. Unless you are 20 years old and in fantastic shape it's somewhat difficult to walk around the property. Especially in the dead of summer here it's 110-115 degrees. There is also little to no parking. Every parking space next to their nice waterpark, adult pool, family pool etc was filled up. The entire parking lot was filled to capacity so unless you want to wait to be crowded into an over stuffed van that drives you around the property to take you to the different areas of the resort you have to walk them which like i mentioned before is very difficult with all of the steep hilly inclines. So our nice walk around the property ended me being tired, huffing and puffing, and sweaty. I'm obviously not in tip top shape but that was just a little ridiculous. Our room was right next to a nice looking pool overlooking a the area below but we couldn't really get to it. The path to the pool from our room was up a very very steep road. So steep that it was just too much trouble to try to walk to the pool and since the parking is no existent it made no sense to drive to the pool. We went off property to eat and since the hotel is on a mountain we had to drive awhile to find any decent places to eat that were not in the run down part of phoenix. When we came back we had decided to checkout and find another place to stay the weekend. We went back to the hotel and called the front desk and told them we would like to check out early. They did offer to find us a new room but we didn't think we would enjoy ourselves. They told us they usually require 24 hour notice to cancel but they were nice enough to let us checkout the next day with no other charges ( i hope, as of now they have only billed us for the one night stay plus $12 for the use of the internet) So we are thirsty so my hubby said he's going to find a coke machine and get some ice. He comes back about 30mins later empty handed. We have a vending area right by our door but there is no coke machine. He hikes all around this hilly property to 2 different coke machines neither of which are working. He hikes from the hills to the gift shop in the lobby but it has now closed. There is nowhere else to buy a coke except order room service or drink from the mini bar. I'd rather not pay $3 for a can of coke but we were so thirsty we ended up drinking to cans of soda from the mini bar. I'm convinced the have non working coke machines to MAKE you buy the overpriced mini bar drinks. We could barely sleep all night with being thirsty all night ( you can't drink phoenix water unless you want to get sick) the loud clunking noise coming from the ac, the small full size bed for two people and the thought of our weekend ruined. We checked out first thing the next morning and went to the The Buttes Marriott resort in Tempe and that was the BEST decision we ever mad. I will give a review of that fantastic place next.

I met up with a friend who was here on business. Through travel rewards, she managed to get a King Presidential Suite which provided beautiful, condo-like quarters with design touches like high wood-beamed ceilings, a stained glass window in the bathroom and a nicely furnished and inviting balcony off the bedroom. The room was appointed with a fully-functional kitchen with full-sized fridge. When you walk into the room from an outside corridor, you enter into a great room with the high ceilings with wood-beamed ceiling. The decor was southwestern, and although southwestern decor is a little out of date and seemed so cliche for Phoenix, it felt fresh because it went nicely with the room's architecture. The layout: To the right in the great room is a large living room seating area with huge sectional and chairs with large coffee table. To the left of the door was a desk near the front window, and straight ahead towards the kitchen was a gorgeous dining table that would have been suitable for a formal dinner party. A little overkill (who would throw a dinner party at a hotel???) but I'm not complaining. Then, from the front door past the dining table was a kitchen. Although the kitchen was definitely a separate room, it melded into the great room as there was a bar counter/stools behind the dining table, so of course you could see into the kitchen from the great room. When you walk through the great room towards the bedroom, the kitchen is on the left, and then there is a nicely tiled, elegant half bath beyond the kitchen also on the left as you come up to the bedroom door. When you open the door, an expansive bedroom is revealed with large bathroom, double vanities and separate large changing area on the left. Bed on the right, and balcony straight ahead. Our suite faced west from the balcony and the colorful sunsets over the nearby hills were a real treat. I definitely could have lived here, no problem! The grounds were beautiful. It's set up like a Mediterranean hillside village with many small winding streets on the grounds. Walks were very nice, although some might find a leisurely walk a little arduous since it is so hilly. Near our building there was a waterfall in the cliff across the street. If you feel like a real hike you can actually meander your way into some open desert mountain terrain on the property. There are several pools on the property some with outdoor bars which were very nice, though drink prices were kind of steep (and mine were kind of weak). There are also several dining options on the property ranging from casual to upscale. I didn't actually try these places out except for some appetizers at one of the outdoor bars. There are also several well equipped gyms on the property too. The one I went to was expansive, had plenty of cardio, nautilus, and even an impressive array of free weights. It was probably around 1000 sq. feet, and I only ever saw one other person there. I may be mistaken, but I think you had to pay for gym access, but we were covered with my friend's travel rewards. Annoyingly, you had to pay for internet access which was hardwired with the outlet at the desk. This was about a year ago, so hopefully they have come into the modern age and put in wifi.

Pretty much identical layout for all standard rooms: living room (which included a sleeper sofa). short passage (with toilet/shower on one side and sink on the other) through to the bedroom. There are doors on either end of the passage so privacy can be had. As a standard room setup, this is great! Very comfortable beds. Flat panel TVs in both living room and bedroom. Wired internet in room. Lots of space. Good housekeeping. First, the positives. As other have commented, it is a beautiful location. There are pools throughout the property (so one never far away) and the main pool complex is enjoyable (although describing it as a water 'park' is a bit much...the highly advertised slide is a fun (but short) experience). The views from Different Point of View are stunning. I didn't eat there, but drinks on the terrace at night were very enjoyable. The grounds are immaculate. The staff are very friendly and a problem with our billing was fixed quickly by reception. When I called housekeeping about a missing bottle opener, staff brought the replacement within a couple minutes. They are also flexible about allowing you to stay after official checkout. As a meeting venue, it is fantastic. Event catering was good, the meeting rooms were configurable for different sizes of events and the AV setup was well-handled. The conference center is next to the main building, so very convenient for those staying in the main building. Now, the negatives. It is pretty isolated. The hotel does provide a shuttle (for a fee) to get to the local shopping mall, but you really need a car to get to anything outside of the resort. Without a car you are a willing hostage. Internet is $12/day (although you can print out boarding passes for free and they do offer free printing in the business center from your own laptop). As for the food, I only ate at the Cantina (the Mexican restaurant in the main building overlooking the family pool). it was OK but not great and I could taste no alcohol in my drinks (and IMO was overpriced for what you got). As others have noted, it is fairly spread out/hilly and for those with mobility issues, it can be a challenge. However, the free shuttle service is excellent (one of my colleagues was staying up the hill and the shuttle appeared 3 minutes after she placed the call) and the staff encourage use of the service. The layout is fairly confusing. There are a number of footpaths/bridges that provide shortcuts (so that guests don't have to walk in the roads) but they're not obvious. Again, staff are very good about telling you about them, but I think the signage to these paths could use some improvement. Signage for drivers was very good.

We have been to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area many times, and have stayed at the Pointe a number of times before: winter and summer seasons. Needless to say, if we didn't like it, I wouldn't have booked this stay. However, I must say that having returned to the Pointe so often ~ probably 7 or 8 times, dating back 12 years ~ that we'll book someplace else, for our next visit. Remembering back to my first stay ~ a business trip ~ I was really impressed with the resort: unique grounds, great facilities, a nice selection of restaurants, fantastic pool area, comfortable and spacious rooms. I can tell you this: if you're a first-time visitor, you will probably love the place. After a couple business trips, I returned there a few times on my own, and actually got engaged at \"A Different Pointe of View,\" the upscale restaurant on the property. So, all things considered, the Pointe will always be special to me/us. On this most-recent visit, we used the Pointe as an \"home base.\" Aside from breakfast, we drove to other restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area to go \"the local route.\" As you know, it's always fun to try new restaurants, and go back to some local-area favorites. And there are plenty of great restaurants, not more than a 30-minute drive from the Pointe. If there was a negative Pointe on this trip, it would be the breakfast. We got the Hilton's \"Bounce Back\" Breakfast Deal. For a discounted price, you get to select from the breakfast menu every day. However, be careful here and read the fine print. To be fair, just about everything is included in the deal option; you can get a very inclusive breakfast everyday, including juice and coffee. But, read the menu closely. For example: one morning, my wife elected to order a breakfast entree that actually cost less than what I paid for the daily breakfast meal deal ~ you get coupons to use at the restaurant every day. Along with the entree, she ordered juice. Well, the entree she ordered did not include juice, so we got billed an extra $4.00. That rubbed me the wrong way. But those are the rules/terms, folks. So, read the fine print, or ask the waiter/waitress, before you order. Also, on this trip, a couple of the breakfasts came to us \"cool,\" not hot. Cool eggs. Hashed browns. Sausage/Bacon. It was just OK. I don't usually complain about minor things like this. However, it was sub-par, when expecting a nice, hot breakfast. Other than that . . . If you've never been to the Pointe, by all means, give it a try. If you're a young couple, it's a romantic place. If you have kids, the pool area is special, and there's a place to keep your kids, too. (Do everybody a favor, though. Keep them away from that young couple looking for a little romance!) There's something here for everybody to enjoy. Singles. Families. Young marrieds. Business travelers. Active older folks, too. First trip? You'll probably want to come back again.

The room itself was fine - since I was with a Diamond Member we received probably one of the nicest rooms in the complex - set far away from most of the craziness. If we had been put up in the main building or some of the more crowded areas I would have been very annoyed with the noise. Even up away from the crowds noise was still a problem, as was parking. The large pool was pretty much shut-down, very few people there and the waterslide they advertise with such fervor wasn't even in operation. The golf course messed up our reservations and moved our tee time an hour earlier without telling us. They claim they did not do this, but I had a reservation confirmation showing that they did. They moved our tee time to accommodate a larger group coming in, and didn't have the courtesy to call and let us know. The best part about our stay was the little pool up near our complex. It was quiet and relaxing. Although we had to call to the front desk to get the hot tub heater fixed (it was tepid at best), the maintenance person arrived promptly and fixed it.

Every meal we had at the resort was mediocre at best, and after the second day we just started leaving for our meals. Way over priced for what you get.

Although it was in the 50s-low 60s the day we stayed at TC, we decided that it was still worth a trip to the water park/ pool. (When you come from the 10s & 20s, 50s & 60s is quite a warm-up!) This area is pretty well removed from the vast majority of the guest rooms and almost needs to be driven to because of the lack of walks along most of the interior drives. The pool facilities were very nice and very welcomed and the Cascades bar was also good. There is a smaller pool/ spa/ workout room in the center of the main guest room area, though it looked largely closed while we were there. One area I would caution guests to was the Point in Tyme restaurant, which is located near the main pool area. We went for breakfast before checking out and it was a disaster. The service was abysmal and the food neither worth the wait or the price (45 minutes and $13 for huevos rancheros!). This was noteworthy because it was definitely not high season when we were there, so I can only imagine what a treat it is in peak times. Overall, I would recommend a stay at Tapatio Cliffs. My wife and I would definitely have stayed another night if our schedule would have allowed and hope to get back for another stay the next time we're in Phoenix. I should note that the resort is in the final stages of a renovation project, which currently has the main lobby gutted and moved to temporary quarters elsewhere in the main building. Some of the parking around the main building was torn up or used as staging, but it wasn't a big deal overall and I wouldn't let it dissuade you from staying at the TC.", "Date": "January 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cAn oasis in the desert\u201d", "Author": "wanderlustgyrl", "ReviewID": "UR12176340", "Content": "Suites at this resort are spread out against a hilltop and look like a series of apartment buildings.

The property is undergoing a complete renovation. The lobby/check-in has been temporarily moved across the street to the ballroom. They were repaving the roads when we arrived so they placed us in the main building, which is a four story garden type hotel. We were on the third floor overlooking one of the pools. When you enter your suite, there is a sitting room with a desk, couch, bar, and a new flat panel tv. Then you walk into a tiled area that has a sink, counter, mirror, and a separate room for the shower/tub and restroom. Two people can easily get ready at the same time in this arrangement. The final room of the suite is the bedroom. Ours came with two queen beds, both with plush down comforters and pillows. This room also had a tv, a closet, and a chest of drawers. I believe each room also has a balcony. The couch in the sitting room did not make out into a bed, so the following day, we asked if we could move to one of their outer buildings. They were very gracious to move us into building one. In our new room, the couch made out into a bed, so the room could accommodate up to a maximum of six people, although we just had four. The views from the balcony are a lot prettier from the outer buildings, although the parking can be a bit challenging. (There are narrow roads between the buildings which has limited parking for guests. If you get there later in the evening and the spaces are full, you have to walk up or down the hill to a parking lot). The hotel was very quiet during the Christmas season, and they were not using many of their outer buildings. The hotel staff was very accommodating, meeting every request we had. They give complimentary papers in the morning. They have a computer where you can check in for your flight if you are flying. There are many pools across this property, a work out room, golf, many restaurants, and hiking and horse-back riding right next door to the property.

The bed skirt on my friend's bed was splattered with blood (without a doubt) and I also found that I had a dead bug between my cover and sheets. We phoned the front desk and housekeeping was dispatched and the bedding was replaced. For dinner we went to The Pointe In Tyme. Our waiter was very personable, he offered suggestions and raved over the onion soup. Our drink order was taken and 12 minutes later, our drinks arrived. Our meal, consisting of 2 burgers, 2 soups and 3 salads arrived 40+ minutes later. The soup was horrible. Grocery store, off the shelf soup has more flavor and personality then what we were served. The pecan salads were the size of a side salad. They consisted of greens, pecans and with very little cheese. Though it was very tasty, they were certainly not worth the $8.00 price tag. We informed the waiter that the soup certainly did not live up to our expectations. The waiter tasted my soup and confirmed that it was \"very bland\" and was probably a pot thrown together, after they had run out of the earlier batch. We were offered a free desert and the cost of the soups were removed from our bill. After a disappointing meal, we retired to our rooms. Sunday morning, yes SUNDAY morning before 9 am, we were woken by the hammering, chiseling, tape ripping and talking going on while the removal of room numbers and application of new ones took place, to our door and the rooms around us. This was not the only project going on. I phoned the manager and was informed that he was not available and he would be calling me back. I did let the desk know what my complaint was and within 10 minutes, the one project (chiseling the numbers off the door) was stopped but there were still other work going on that we could hear. At 10:30 am, my friend and I went to take showers and found there was no running water. I phoned the front desk and was notified that the city had a station down.

Parking there was MISERABLE, and it appeared to maybe a prom weekend because there were a lot of young people making it a busy place. We drove around forever, and finally ended up having to pull over near our room and drag our luggage up the side of a mountain to our room. I had read this place was hilly, but it makes the streets of San Francisco look like cake. Once we finally got the luggage to the room, we parked on the other side of the property and started our hike to the room. We were trying to find the room in the dark and a hotel van pulled up asking us if we needed help. Instead of driving us to the room, the guy pointed us in the right direction and drove off. So by the time all of that was done, it had been an hour since we checked in, we were tired, sweaty and angry over the lack of assistance. The hotel was beautiful and I would gladly stay there if ever in Phoenix again, however I would recommend to make sure that you receive assistance with bags!", "Date": "June 24, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, Relaxing weeklong visit\u201d", "Author": "RedSox604", "ReviewID": "UR7846555", "Content": "Stayed here a week in June, for the Red Sox series in Phoenix and just a girls getaway weekend. We had a great and very relaxing stay at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs. I wasn't expecting much, after the registration clerk who checked me in very late Wednesday night was not very friendly or informative, but everything was great thereafter. It is a bit overwhelming at first, seeing the layout and many buildings that are mostly up on the hillside, but the very friendly bellman gave me a map and directions to my room, and I found it with ease. THE SUITES: -All rooms are two room suites: a living room area with wetbar, bedroom, and bathroom with a separated sink area. There was also a balcony with chairs/table to enjoy the view. -The beds were very comfortable, the regular Hilton Serenity bedding type. -The room was very clean, as were the linens and towels. The towels were also a bit more substantial that a standard hotel bath towel. -Bathrobes provided for your use during stay. -Plenty of closet space and drawers to unpack your belongings. -Fairly soundproof: I didn't hear much noise from the adjacent suites, except one evening when a child was crying fairly loud. -Drawback, is that there is no in-room safe for storing belongings. RECREATION: -7 pools total: the large Falls Water Village, which featured two pools, waterfalls, activities, etc., as well as smaller/quieter pools scattered throughout the property. The smaller pools had nice padded lounge chairs, which were a plus. -Ability to reserve a poolside cabana at the Falls Water Village. At around $50 for the day, well worth it. It was sometimes difficult to find enough shade at the regular chairs. The cabana gets you two padded lounge chairs, table and chairs, ceiling fan, mini-fridge and TV. -Poolside service at the Falls Water Village, including food and a full bar. Just raise the flag on your lounge chair and they will stop by for your order. Someone will also come by about once an hour and provide you with an ice cold towel to cool down. DINING: -Enjoyed a late lunch at the Pointe in Tyme restaurant. The service was excellent, and although we ordered only sandwiches and french fries, they were really excellent. -Had room service a couple of times: typical of hotel room service. The menu was similar to Pointe in Tyme, and the food was good, but not as great as it was at the restaurant. They were very prompt, and after waiting only 35 minutes for dinner one evening, the called to offer apologies and brought complimentary dessert (which was excellent!) -Food ordered poolside is provided by the Cascades. It was OK(since I didn't need to leave my cabana), but I've had much better. However the margaritas are excellent. -Coffee, lattes, breakfast pastries and fruit are offered all day in the gift shop. Nice to stop in for a quick latte or snack. -I didn't get an opportunity to try The Cantina: tried one evening, but despite seeing several empty tables, was informed by the hostess that it would be a 45 minute wait. OTHER: Service- The front desk staff and the concierge were not particularly friendly or helpful. The rest of the staff: waiters, bellman, bartenders, etc., were very accomodating. Location- Easy to find, about a 15 minute drive from Sky Harbor airport. Not much within walking distance given the size of the resort, so you will likely need a car to get anywhere outside the resort. There is a Starbucks within a 1/2 mile of the resort entrance, and Scottsdale is an easy drive for finding dining and shopping options. Housekeeping-They did a great job each day, and were quiet while they went about it. I slept in every morning, and wasn't awoken by the sounds of nearby rooms being cleaned. Parking-Not enough parking at the buildings up on the hills. Each building easily had 20-30 Suites, but only 6-8 parking spaces. Since everything is on hills, it can be quite a hike up to your suite if you have parked nearer the main building. View-I paid extra for an upgraded view ($5 based on availability via the hotel's website). I think in some cases, the view from a standard room's balcony would literally be of the back of another building. Business-Just a quick note, since on my last review of a Hilton I noted that their internet charges were excessive, this Hilton also charges for internet use in the room, or $0.49/minute in the business center BUT at least this Hilton lets you print boarding passes for free. Overall - my friend and I really enjoyed our stay at the Pointe Hilton. It was just right for a girls weekend away.

The coupon covers a continental buffet of yogurt, assorted pastries & fruit. For another $4 you can add omelets, bacon, frech toast, etc. It was a great breakfast buffet! (the bacon was fabulous!!) The pools were nice with cool water and a whirlpool with warm (not hot) water. We thought both were kept at a nice temperature.

They have a separated pool for adults and another for families. The pool area was not always cleaned quite as quick as it could have been, lots of plastic glasses left around the pool. We left a feedback at the end of our stay and were contacted very promptly after we arrived back at home by the manager concerned about the situation. The room was very inviting. Nice living room when you enter with a soft couch and nice office/desk area. The bedroom through the hall was spacious and updated with a very comfortable mattress. The bathroom area left something to be desired, very clean but in need of some updating. The water at the hotel did not have a good taste, not sure if it was the hotel or just Phoenix in general. We decided to dine at \"Different Pointe of View\" at the top of Tapatio Cliffs. This was the highlight of our stay. The cuisine was amazing and the Fiji water (included in the cost) was a very welcome treat. Our waiter never let us see the bottom of our water glass no matter how hard we tried. The views were amazing and our reservation time was kept. We had requested a window view and had to wait a few minutes for them to get it ready. The cost to dine is very high so don't expect to dine for less than for less than $75-100 per person (with a glass of wine). We had breakfast the next morning at Pointe in Tyme.

My wife and I had a wonderful time, but we did stay on Hilton Honors Reward Points. I am not sure I would\u2019ve had as wonderful a time if I was paying. While physically beautiful, the property is very hilly; so if you have issues with walking and/or dealing with up/down hill grades, this property will be a challenge. Parking on the resort is tough. There are not enough spots near the various resort room buildings for all the guests\u2019 cars. We did not have any issues with this except for the one night we returned to the resort late at night. We ended parking quite a ways from our room building. Smoking. The resort rooms are non smoking, but guests smoke on the decks and patios outside the rooms. There\u2019s nothing you can do about this except complain, and nothing will happen. If you do not like cigarette smoke and you end up in a room above or next to a room where people are smoking on the decks/patios you will be upset. The lounge at the Different Point of View is all smoking. They have a decent jazz band there on Friday and Saturday nights and the view from the patios outside are very nice. But, if you do not like cigarette smoke, your visit to the lounge may not be enjoyable. We got lucky and sat in area where no one was smoking, but there were ashtrays on every table. Breakfast and brunch service in the Pointe in Tyme dining room was very slow. We were told that if we wanted something off the menu, the wait would be an hour. We opted for the satisfactory buffet. Our room was quiet, except for one instance of kids yelling in the Cabana Circle pool later at night. The resort is pretty and is well maintained. The one meal we ate in the Different Point of View Lounge was tasty (and again, we were lucky and not bothered smokers). The Different Point of View Lounge has the same menu as the Restaurant but seating is first come first served. On the Saturday night during out stay, there was a high school prom on the property. We not impacted by this event, but my wife overheard a property staffer tell two prom goers (presumably the two in charge of the event), that if there were any problems, the whole thing would be shut down.

I only had dial up at my future mother in law's house so it was hard for me to do any sort of detailed search for a hotel. I stumbled upon some details about Tapatio Cliffs and called their reservation line to put us down for two nights. I called PSM to cancel and the rep tried to tell me if I called on March 10th I might be able to add the second night at a lower rate if they had an opening (what part of \"it is our wedding weekend\" didn't they understand?). I mention all of this because I was worried at this point that my experience with PSM did not bode well for our alternate arrangements. How wrong I was! Staying at the Tapatio Cliffs was wonderful! When we arrived to check in we let the person at the desk know we'd just gotten married (I think the fact that I still had my hair up helped) and he said he would upgrade us from a basic room to an executive one. He also had chocolate covered strawberries and champagne sent up that night with handwritten note of congratulations. The room was lovely, it overlooked one of the many pool areas and it had a bedroom separate from the living room. A tv was in both rooms. The bed was extra comfy and we were at the end of a hall so it was very quiet. Room service was fairly priced and the food was wonderful. While we were there we had cheese pizza, veggie burgers with fries, creme brulee, and as many pitchers of ice water as we wanted. The next morning we ate a breakfast buffet (I had opted for rooms that included some romance package deals like breakfast buffets for two and a buy one get one free entree coupon -- really worth it). The fruit was fresh and the service was wonderful. Later that day we sat by the pool and ordered drinks -- they have flags on the chairs so you can put them up to let staff know you'd like to order something. I'd never done anything like this before so it felt very decadent. The pools were great, we even tried out the water slide. The music selection playing by the pool was good too, a fair mix of old and new top-40 songs. We ate at the Mexican restaurant they have on site and again, the service and food were excellent. I know I read gushing reviews and think things couldn't have possibly been that great but they really were. Well, here are a few critical comments. It was weird was how far away the ice machine was on our floor but we just ordered pitchers of ice water instead. I will also add that you might want to map the location of the hotel because we were happy to be away from it all so I don't know about how close off-site dining or activities are. We did have an experience that could be viewed as negative as on our first night there we had a knock on the door and a plumber said he needed to check the bathtub because he thought it was leaking downstairs. We were kind of annoyed to be intruded upon especially when the gentleman checked the tub and said he'd come back tomorrow morning. My husband asked if we could call and let the front desk know when we were up and about and they could come then and the plumber agreed. The next day we called to let them know we were heading to the pool and when we came back there was a note saying everything was okay. The man was professional and we both felt that it did not ruin our experience at the hotel. There was a moment of panic, however, when we asked if we'd have to move rooms and were told the hotel was entirely booked. Luckily we were able to stay and had a great weekend. We actually live in Las Vegas so we're used to seeing fancy resort hotels but I loved the atmosphere of Tapatio Cliffs. And to be away from the smoke, gambling, and crowds was great too.

I believe they are masters at \"puffing the goods.\" It seems that many of the Hilton properties are touted as being the best and when you arrive, you are always short changed. This property didn't differ. I came to this property for a business function. Prior to arrival, I was concerned that I receive a quality room due to the many comments about the rooms being dated. I was assured I would receive a great room and upon arrival, I recieved a room with a view of the adjacent highway. HINT: When a customer takes the time to call prior to arrival, you have a small idea they might be a tad bit high maintenance. A note in the file and a proper room assignment might have been a good idea on their part, but this is absolutely typical of the Hilton brand. Of course I requested a move and only when pushed did the staff offer me a pool view for an upcharge of $50. The staff assumed that because there was an upcharge, I wouldn't pay it. How ridiculous! I accepted the upcharge and was happy to have a better view. The room was spacious and fairly well appointed. I would agree it was dated, but according to the staff it IS remodeled. They did a remodel about 4 years ago on the entire property, so what you see is what you get. During my stay, we ran out of toilet paper. We had to request this from the staff FOUR times. This was ridiculous given that we had put the empty roll out for the housekeeping staff to see. There were other occasions where I needed to call the front desk (usually to request toilet paper) and found they did not answer the phone. I needed to know what time my event started and was quoted a wrong time which caused me to arrive late. I needed to know what time check out was an had to call three times before someone answered. The pool was lovely, the staff were friendly and helpful and provided great service. The property is full of hills (it sits on the side of a cliff) but I didn't mind that. I found a very private pool w/ hot tub called the Hidden Valley pool that was very enjoyable and I never saw another soul there. The property needs maintenance and again I feel they missed the mark in using red, green, yellow and blue lighting all over the property which gives you a sense you might have been transported to the Circus.

We (my wife, myself and two daughters 5 & 9) just returned from a four day stay 4/10 - 4/13 and had an excellent experience. This resort is a solid 3 - 3 1/2 stars and a good overall value but do not book expecting a 4 or 5 star property. For the $150/night we paid, I was very happy. All rooms are two room suites with a good layout, comfortable beds and furnishings. The furnishings and room were that of a quality 3 - 3 1/2 star hotel. Very nice and functional, not the bells, whistles and special touches of a 4 or 5 star resort. The Falls Water Village has 2 large pools, waterslide, 2 hot tubs, bathrooms and pool side service. While the pool area did get crowded, we were always able to find 4 lounge chairs together and the crowds didn't bother us. Basically families with younger children splashing and laughing in the water. The resort has a total of 8 pools (some very small) and the pools outside of the Falls Water Village seemed more quiet, sedate and an \"adult setting\". They do have some pools reserved for Adults Only. The pool towels were a bit thin, but we got two a piece and that worked just fine. We found the pool area well maintained and the pool bathrooms some of the cleanest I have ever found. The pool side service was very good and responsive.

There are many pools, the most popular for kids being the Falls complex, with one good water slide, an irregular shaped pool with plenty of play space and a jacuzzi. It was nice, but not spectacular. The rooms were clean and well decorated. I don't like though, having the toilet and tub in a separate area from the sink. It seems crazy to have a hall between them, but oh well. The suite also has a sitting area with a TV, then you pass through the hall with the bathroom facilities into a bedroom, nicely furnished. There is a small fridge in the suite with freezer, and two TV's - one in the sitiing area and one in the bedroom. This was nice for me as I could put the kids to sleep and still read or watch TV in the sitting room. The onsite restaurants were good, but pricey.

Parking fills up in the parallel spots right in front of the rooms, but large parking lots are on the other side of the rooms. Our room was a 1 bedroom suite w/balcony. We found it large and nicely decorated. We found the seperate living room and bathroom areas a nice touch especially since our child gets up at the crack of dawn. One parent could get up and play with him in the other room with the door closed and let the other parent get more sleep. The room was very clean except the floors. I think they could have vaccumed and swept better. I found the plumbing in the room above us to be very loud in the early morning. We did not need an alarm clock because every time someone went the bathroom upstairs it jarred us awake at 6am. The noise shut off after 30 seconds or so but by then my child was already awake for the day. This was my only major complaint about the hotel. Other than that everything else was better that I had expected. The view from our room balcony was very nice and we overlooked the waterfall which sounded nice as well. We spent sometime at a few of the pool areas and were thrilled at how much thought had gone into the design. There are many water features such as water fountains and waterfalls. The pool closes at 7pm. We thought that was early compared to other hotels we have been to in the past. We had a late breakfast at the Point in Thyme restaurant on the grounds.

I was not expecting much based off of previous reviews so I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and quality of the food we ordered.

We came back from a day at the Peoria Sports Complex and did not want to search for a restaurant off the premises. We ate at the Cantina which served Mexican food.

For the same price per night, you cannot even compare the hotels. First, we arrived early on a Thursday and were informed that our room would not be ready until 4 pm. We basically wasted the first day of our trip (and the best weather day) waiting in the lobby for our room to be ready, even though we were told it would be ready by noon. The front desk staff was rude and sarcastic, which made matters worse. I have never had that problem at a Hilton. While we were waiting, we ate at the outdoor cafe, Cascades, and the food was horrible--stay away from the fish tacos which were merely fried pieces of crunchy batter. The rooms need to be updated and they were pretty drab--old couches and furniture--nothing fancy. The bed, however, was comfortable. The housecleaning servce leaves a lot to be desired. Finally, there is nothing to do at the hotel and they are pretty stingy with any kind of shuttle service. We rented a car for the day just to get off the grounds. On the plus side, there are pools and spas all over which are nice, although most of the lounge chairs are uncomfortable and do not have cushions. They also pass out regular, scratchy, non absorbent towels and not plush beach towels at the pool. There is an exercise room which is average-a few machines. The Point In Thyme restaurant was nice and room service was good. We did not eat at the Mexican restaurant. The Spa was nice and the body wrap was a nice experience but the Spa was definitely average and the place and the rooms were small. The view from our room was really pretty, we stayed in building 8 on the second floor and we overlooked the Falls village. We actually did not mind the walk around the resort but a resort shuttle is available. I am not a spoiled princess by any means but for the price we payed, 279.00/night, I definitely expected more luxury. I stayed at a Hilton in New Orleans, post Katrina, for 99$ a night and had more comfort. We also recently stayed at a Hilton in San Francisco for $119 a night and had a lot more luxury and comfort.

We booked the hotel largely on the basis of positive Trip Advisor reviews, and were not disappointed. The resort is set out, as noted in other reviews, over 65 acres and is a series of two to four story buildings. All of the rooms are suites (I believe) and have spacious balconies. The suite we had featured a large living room with full-sized couch, TV, mini-bar, arm chair and desk. There were double doors that lead to a divided bathroom, then a sliding door through to the bedroom. This worked very well in terms of providing an environment in which I could work and my wife could sleep undisturbed. The room was clean and well appointed, and featured a comfortable king-size bed and a second TV. The resort also has a large water park with several pools spread over the property. We booked the \"romance package\" for $219 a night - this included a full breakfast for each of us (valued up to $44 combined), bottle of champagne, a two for one coupon for dinner and free use of the workout room (normally $10). A very good value compared to other prices we noted for similar hotels. The resort is in the northern part of Phoenix (25 min. drive to airport) and is built on a rocky bluff, so some of the rooms are a bit of a hike, although staff will pick you up and shuttle you anywhere you wish to go in the resort. If you want to be close to the Scottsdale shops and restaurants this is probably not the best choice for you. We drove to \"old town\" Scottsdale in about 25-30 minutes using the city streets rather than freeways. We preferred the rather secluded atmosphere of the resort but this may not work for everyone. There are three main restaurants on site plus a cafe by the main pool- we ate several time at Pointe in Thyme (main restaurant) and the breakfast were fine; average I suppose. We read good reviews of the mexican restaurant (nice balcony to sit on) but did not dine there. The upscale restaurant \"Different Pointe of View\" has an unbelievable view over Phoenix - even if you don't eat there go up before sunset and see the view. Our meal was excellent but not cheap- lobster with scallops ($42) was very nice and the lobster bisque was as good as I have had. Note: there is also an outside deck one level lower for the lounge, so if you don't want to spring for dinner, this is a good second choice.

We recommend the strawberry margaritas while lounging by the water here. Other recommendations while in Phoenix: hike Camelback mountain early in the morning, visit the Phoenix Museum of History in Heritage Square and have lunch in the Arizona Center close by, visit Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West, and if you're a pizza lover as we are, definitely go to Pizza Bianco, also in Heritage Square!

Everything from the electronics to the plumbing worked flawlessly, and the air-conditioning was more than adequate despite temperatures in the 100's.

The majority of the time we utilized the adult only pool. Never encountered a problem finding an adequate location, sun or shade - although it did get a bit more crowded in the afternoons. Moreover, all chaise lounges in the adult area were fitted with comfortable pads rather than the usual plastic loungers found at other hotels and resorts. The pool water was refreshing despite a blazing sun and temperatures in the triple digits. Although a number of reviewers complained about the resort's steep inclines and their negative parking experiences, neither was an issue for us as we are both physically fit and active and actually enjoyed walking around the resort complex.

Wow, the smell of acrylic nail chemicals hits you as soon as you walk in the door. We moved on to check out the pools in the Falls Water Village. Now granted, we were there during Memorial Day weekend so we had a feeling it would be pretty busy but what a zoo! There were so many people jammed into the pool that they were on top of each other. Even the Grotto Pool which was supposedly the \"Adult Pool\" (i.e. quieter pool) had screaming kids everywhere. Nighttime wasn't much better.

Not knowing what to expect, we were pleasantly surprised by the location, rooms and staff service. We were in one of the mountainside suites, which was located in a quieter area away from the main building. Even though we had a bit of a walk to the main pool area, it was right next to a very enjoyable smaller pool that was much quieter than the main pool/waterfall area if you're looking for a way to get away from the noise of kids (they were packed on Mother's Day weekend). We thoroughly enjoyed getting up in the morning and following the walking trails that connected to the resort near the tennis courts -- very convenient without having to cross busy traffic. Get up early though if you want to avoid extreme heat! The room itself was very clean with modern furnishings and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on in a hotel! Having a balcony was a treat for when we came back from walking or the pool to just hang out and enjoy the mountains in the distance. While there were some spots that looked a tad dated around the resort, it was beautifully landscaped and the staff all had smiles on their faces and cheer in their voices. Because it is built into the side of a mountain, there are lots of hills and a twisting parking lot, but don't let that deter you if you don't mind the exercise. While we didn't eat at the resort, we found some GREAT restaurants within a 15 minute drive (we rented a car). Carolina's is a small short-order Mexican restaurant that is only about a 5-minute drive away on Cactus Road (go north from the resort on 7th St and turn right on Thunderbird/Cactus. I think it's at the intersection of Cactus and Cave Creek.) They had the BEST flour tortillas -- wafer thin, delicate, and huge. I can see why people drive from a distance just to take some home. It's very affordable too. My husband and I ate there on multiple occasions, and each time our bill ranged from $9-$14 for the two of us. For finer dining, we also went to a little place called Coup des Tartes on N.16th St. It's a small house converted into an elegantly romantic French restaurant. They don't have a liquor license, so you're encouraged to bring your own wine, which many people were doing. A grocery store is just north of the resort, so we were able to bring some too. The food was stellar, using the freshest ingredients. I highly recommend their signature lamb dish and the roquefort salad. Be sure to save room for dessert; you'll want their homemade tarts like the lemon tart with meringue four inches tall. Our final dinner was spent at a place called Richardson's that the concierge recommended. It's specialty is Southwest food, and while the concierge warned us that the place would look like a seedy bar when we first pulled up, the food is amazing. He was right! Both places were pricier, but the food was outstanding at both. If you get a chance, take a side trip to Scottsdale to the Frank Lloyd Wright estate for one of their nighttime tours. It was less than 30 minutes from the resort and the estate and architecture school lit up at night (plus the 2 hour tour) are well worth it.

We asked two different front desk employees about DVD players in the room and said to both that it was not a problem if they did not have a DVD player as we would just bring our own. We even had this conversation with the very nice person who checked us in. Needless to say, at 5 pm when we tried to connect our DVD player, we found out that there was \"absolutely no way\" to connect our DVD player to use the line in on the hotel TV because of the hotel's \"contract\" with their media provider. If someone had mentioned this to us, we could have planned accordingly and brought our own TV (though this seems rediculous to have to do). The manager on duty (Dan Nichols (spelling?)) was rude to my friend and dismissive. After another call and about an hour and a half, they offered us a solution...they could bring us a DVD player that would work on their TV's, BUT--it would cost an additional $85! You have got to be kidding me? $85 to use their DVD player for 5 hours? Why even offer that? Well...what could we expect for what we were paying for the room since we got it from Priceline? Too bad so sad for us. Why sell your rooms on Priceline if you are going to snub the guests who buy them? If you don't want \"cheepos\" like us there...don't sell the rooms on discount sites.

My partner and I were visiting family in the Phoenix area and stayed at the Tapatio. Though our stay was only one night, we instantly felt like we were on a wonderful 10-day vacation--- it was so relaxing! The LOCATION of the hotel is awesome - North Phoenix in a hilly residential area, just a few minutes from the freeway, downtown Phx and a quick drive to shops and restaurants. Though the property is expansive, it wasn't as ominous as it appeared on the map given to us upon check-in. It is, however, quite hilly as mentioned by previous reviewers. As for our ROOM, we stayed in the Cliffside Building in room 6225 (1 King bed suite) high above the rest of the resort. Our building felt very secluded and private, built along the rugged mountainside with a great view from our private patio. It was short walk from our room to the lobby andThe Falls/Water Village (about 6-mins.). We had lots of fluffy down pillows and a down comforter that made the bed a dream to stay in (BTW, a hypo-allergenic foam pillow was inside the closet just in case we weren't fond of feathers). The room was tastefully decorated, clean and in full working order. Parking was fine, except when we came home late night and had to park up by the Differrent POV restaurant, a short but STEEP walk up/down-- I guess I really am out of shape! Though we didn't use the shuttle, there were plenty riding around the property. Probably the best part of our stay was the pool... or POOLS. There were pools everywhere! My partner and I were in the mood to be total loungers and to just relax, eat, drink and swim. After we checked in, we immediate went to The Falls/Water Village for a swim. The Water Village is made up of two big pool areas - one with a waterslide, grottos and a mini-beach (no sand, just an ascending floor) and another more shaded pool with less hustle-n-bustle - both surrounded by beautiful landscaping, private cabanas and numerous waterfalls. The Cascade pool bar/cafe had great 'foofy' tropical drinks, light food and great service. We decided to pull a Burt Lancaster and swim in each pool --- I think there were 8! The great thing about this resort is that there are plenty of pools to choose from, depending on your mood: The big, busy pools for families, hanging with friends or to people watch; separate kid-free adult pools as well as semi- private pools with jacuzzis ('our' pool was the Sunset pool just below our room). All were easy to reach and stocked with plenty of fresh towels. Unlike another reviewer, I liked the waterslide and wasn't bothered by its design--- c'mon, man... it's a perk not a required amenity. Though we didn't take advantage of it, we were told by the Cafe that we also had access to the pools at the neighboring Hilton/Squaw Peak if we wanted. Overall, our stay was awesome: Friendly, knowledgeable staff; beautifully maintained grounds; great location; excellent room; great value for the price. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to Phoenix.", "Date": "April 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit area", "Title": "\u201cLoved this resort!\u201d", "Author": "Firsttimers10", "ReviewID": "UR4997521", "Content": "What a wonderful place to stay with children!

There are 8 different pools. One is adults only; the others are for both kids and adults. We managed to experience all of them during the trip! My six year old wanted to try them all (except the adult pool for 16 and over). The main pool at the Falls Village was great for families with kids. Lots of poolside lounge chairs, lots of umbrellas. Nearby the water slide. The grotto pool at the Falls Village is nice, but less shade. Other than the family pool at the main building, the remaining pools are small, but suitable for a quick dip and not laps. The best thing about Falls Village is the ability of ordering food and drink by simply putting up the flag on your chair. We were originally checked into room 4052. This room faced the laundry area, making the patio worthless. Avoid the eastern side of the main building to avoid the laundry area and noisy fans. (Fortunately) the hot water was faulty in the shower, so we got moved to 6224 on the cliffside suites. The hotel was also very kind to credit us the price of our breakfast to compensate for the inconvenience. This was a much nicer room (though slightly smaller)with a gorgeous view and steps from the sunset pool. I agree with the previous poster that navigating your way through the resort is a challenge. The maps are sometimes confusing and don't necessarily take into account the hills. However, enjoying a challenge, I eventually figured out the most efficient way to get from area to area. This is not for everyone however. For those who don't like to navigate hills and a maze of paths, the resort does offer several pick up points that will send a driver with a phone call. Food was basically average at best. First morning we had breakfast at the Point in Tyme restaurant. Service was lousy, and food only so-so. The Cascades restaurant at the Falls Village was okay, and convenient to order by simply putting up your flag for service. We had breakfast buffet at La Cantina which was of lesser quality than Point in Tyme. We never tried any dinners on-site because they really aren't geared towards kids. Very surprising for a resort that has such a family draw. We did not try the Different Pointe of View at the top of the hill as this was highly priced and definitely not kid friendly. We did have breakfast twice at a local restaurant called Pinky's just down the hill from the resort on the corner of Thunderbird and 7th. This was very good and half the price of the resort. Other mornings we purchased bagels, yogurt and fruit from the Safeway next to Pinkys and at it on our patio with the great view. Paradise Valley Mall is nearby that has a wide selection of known chain restaurants, including Marie Callendars, Olive Garden, Outback Steakhouse, and Chilis. Overall food review...unless you are transportation challenged, dine outside the resort if you have kids. In summary, we had a great time at Tapatio Cliffs.

The resort is set in a beautiful location nestled in the hills of northern Phoenix. Our suite had a spacious living room connected through a two-section bathroom to a large bedroom, and had a balcony with views of the surrounding mountains. The room and whole resort were impeccably clean and the furnishings were nice but not ornate. The staff was noticeably friendly, more so than at other resorts where we have stayed. The workout center is moderate-sized and has excellent equipment. I enjoyed running in the Phoenix Mountain Preserve, which connects directly to the resort, and allows you to experience a real desert environment. We also took advantage of using the sister property at Squaw Peak, which had a larger waterpark, mini-golf, and a larger workout center. We got the sense that Squaw Peak was more family-oriented, whereas Tapatio was more geared for couples and corporate retreats, although both properties were equally nice. On our last night, we had a fabulous dinner at the Different Pointe of View restaurant, which was pricey but did have excellent food, and the views of the surrounding hills and the city are unparalleled. The downsides we can think of were that it was sometimes a little noisy around the resort with all the cleaning (street sweeping, leaf-blowing, etc.). Also, the resort is built on a large hillside, which affords excellent views, but could make it difficult to get around for less fit visitors. My wife and I enjoyed this layout, as it built a little exercise into our day. The resort does offer shuttle service, which we used once and found to be very efficient and easy. Finding parking was never a problem. We enjoyed exploring nearby Scottsdale, but did find it to be a bit far from the resort (about a 30 min. drive with no easy highway connections).

The rooms here are quite large and perfect for families with children. Parking is a nightmare though. We rented a private poolside cabana for two days, which was great to have with small children. The pool area looks very nice and is clean, but this weekend it was completely overrun with people who were not guests of the hotel. We knoe this for a fact, as we learned this from the people directly. As a result, the poolside service they promised was dismal at best. On more than one occasion, we placed food and beverage orders and had to chase down the wait staff to find out where our orders were. Lunch on the first day took over an hour, only to have the wrong food arrive. It went on in this same vein for the remainder of the weekend, also at the other restaurants on the property. We made the mistake of ordering room service for breakfast one morning and by the time the food arrived, it was cold and we were missing items (like butter and syrup for pancakes). The staff kept offering apologies simply by informing us how busy they were. I ended up writing a letter to the hotel, and I was sent a very nice response with a promise of a free room, if we would give them another try. We thought why not. We visited over Labor Day weekend and it seemed much less crowded. They were checking names at the gate to the main pool/waterfall/slide area so non paying guests wouldn't be able to use the facilities. This was definitely a step in the right direction. We also rented a poolside cabana for the day. The day started out fantastic, but as soon as our waitress went off duty, we never saw another poolside attendant for the remainder of the day. That evening there was a rain storm and as a result, the ceiling in the bedroom not only leaked extensively, large chunks of plaster started to fall on the bed! This was at 10:00 PM-not pleasant, especially as our children woke up at this point. It was impossible to sleep in the bedroom, due to the noise of the water dripping....something like water torture. We called the front office and they offered to send down a cot-which would do what, we wondered as there were 4 of us. We had to move to a new room, which for anyone traveling with small children, wasn't easy to do at that time of night, having to pack up all our belongings, etc. The next day, they offered a $50 credit towards the room (we stayed an additional night beyond the previously comped room) and when I let them know that wasn't good enough given what we had been through the previous night, they agreed to give us the room for the night at no charge, plus the $50 credit toward food. I was pleased. Until we got our credit card bill and we discovered we were in fact charged for the room. Long story short, they are claiming they never promised the free room as they would never have done such a thing-they only give small credit toward the total room bill itself. Given the fact this was our third such poor service experience at a Hilton property, we have since canceled our frequent traveler account with Hilton and would never use their properties again.", "Date": "October 20, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cCliffs and Cabanas\u201d", "Author": "xenu", "ReviewID": "UR4039651", "Content": "The Presidential Suites in the detached buildings are spacious, well appointed and very inviting.

Considering what I paid for this hotel, it was quite a bargain. However, I would not stay here again if I had to pay more than $100/night. This hotel caters to and attracts LOTS of kids. There were times that it felt like a day care center. And as is typical of parents on vacation with their kids, most of the kids were allowed to run rampant like wild animals. They even invaded the Adult Pool which is clearly labeled as such and the parents watched as their darlings dove, yes dove, in to 4ft deep water. The kids also took over the restaurant during the morning breakfast buffet and created a madhouse. I even saw a kid pick up a donut, take a bite out of it, and put it back in the basket. Fortunately a server saw this and promptly whisked away the whole basket. Another kid was running his fingers through the diced green peppers at the omelette table and his mother said, I quote, \"Don't touch that, you'll get it on your clothes!\" So you can see this is not the place for adults without children or anyone who values hygiene and safety. In general, the rooms were spacious and averagly furnished. They do seem a bit old and not well-maintained. The property is very spread out and you have to walk quite far to get places or you can call for hotel transportation or drive your own car. The Pointe in Thyme restaurant is WAY OVERPRICED, and I suggest finding your breakfast at offsite locations. There is a Village Inn about 2 miles north on 7th, a Denny's about 1 mile west on Cactus, and an IHOP about 5 miles west on Cactus. Don't go there for lunch or dinner either. The Cantina was pretty tasty, but also overpriced. 2 adults can share a burrito and be full. The Different Pointe of View restaurant was spectacular and well worth it. If you are going to be enjoying libations poolside, I recommend going to the Safeway down the street, buying your beverages there, along with some insulated mugs, and storing them in your mini-bar fridge. Instant savings! The spa was very professional and the services were luxurious. However, the description on the website of the body treatments, such as the masks and wraps, does not mention that they include the body brushing that is part of the Body Glow treatment. I signed up for both, received both in succession, then discovered that I paid $65 for something that would have been included in my Seaweed wrap anyway. That was sort of depressing, but I figured that at least I got an additional 20 minutes of massage. So, to sum up, only go here if you have kids and want to let them run wild.

I like the fact that the resort is spread out and is on a hilly area because it lends to more character than a block-building hotel, the buildings are spread out and there are a number of pool areas which allow for more or less relaxation depending on what type of activities you desire. The only annoying thing is the gas-powered golf carts that zip around the resort delivering luggage/people/room service. They are incredibly noisy, kind of like a lawn mower sound, so you don't want to leave your sliding door open while trying to sleep! They are also not that careful about going around the many corners, so you have to be very careful when walking around the resort to avoid being run over!

Previoulsy we have stayed at the Fairmont scottsdale princess & the Biltmore, both in Scottsdale. Firstly the resort is huge - 585 rooms and very impersonal. People at the check in desk were very impersonal (I am a silver VIP member of Hilton's loyalty club) and mistakes were made on our booking, with no hint of apology. We had booked a romance package which included a premium suite with view, champagne and b/fast. We had to ask repeatedly for the wine and as they do not have 24 hour room service then we missed our pre paid b/fast as we had an early flight, as this resort is a good 25/30 minute drive from Phoenix Airport - don't believe the blurb that is it closer. When we asked the resort staff if they could organise something for us they said no! No assistance was offered with bags and the bell desk was unhelpful and gave wrong info. The room (No.4130) was Ok - nothing special, although it was quite spacious. We did have a view - but we also had a view of the air con units and they were very noisy at night. The bathroom was small & basic and the bath was just a standard issue with very low & small hotel bath - no good if you are over 4 feet. The suite was supposedly recently re modelled but the carpet was stained and furniture scratched, and hard to beleive but all of the ornaments/accesserioes were actually glued or nailed to the surfaces - and as we had booked a 5 star hotel and paid $280 for the package we were insuted that the hotel has pre decided that guests could not be trusted! This resort is called the ciffs for a reason - it is built into the side of a cliff and a lot of the suites are up several flights of stairs and along balconies, there are elevators but they are old and not located next to the suites. Parking is a nightmare - there are main carparks which are quite a way from the rooms but there are not enough car spaces for the suites within a close proximity. If you had a large car or had a lot of unloading to do or you have mobility problems then you may struggle. It took 10 minutes of very careful manovering to try and park our car in a very small space- very fustrating. Whist the resort grounds were well kept, the surrounding area was not great and we ended up traveling back to scottsdale to find somewhere where we wanted to eat. There are no faciities outside of the resort within walking distance and the area to the south is not one you would want to be in late at night In all very dissapointing, overpriced and we will not be returning. If we had another night in Phoenix we would stay at the Fairmont or the Biltmore both if which advertise great deals via their websites or Hotels. Scottsdale is a much better location for the airport and facilities, we are frequent international travellers and would not recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Tapatio\u201d", "Author": "bakery", "ReviewID": "UR3301693", "Content": "We just got back from three nights at this resort, and we really enjoyed our stay.

The good news was that the bed was extremely comfortable (nice linens, mattress similar in feel to comfy beds at W Hotels) and the room was probably one of the quietest hotel rooms I've stayed in (maybe we lucked out with quiet neighbors). When checking in, we did request that our room be in a quiet section of the property and we upgraded to a room with a view -- we were in the cliffside area above the Sunset Pool. Room was spacious, OK decor, but it's obvious that the property was built in the 1970s since bathtub, toilet, etc are all of a rather dated vintage. Our suite had open beam cathedral ceilings, which was nice, so I recommend requesting an upper unit. The downside: The resort seems very tired and dated, elevators run very slowly, everything seems a little bit patched together and in need of paint or a good makeover or remodel (I did notice those painted floor tiles in the lobby that someone mentioned, though I didn't think they looked that bad). Service in the restaurant by the pro shop was slow and food was substandard. Fish tacos at Mexican place were OK. Since hotel is built on a hillside, there's lots of walking involved if you are in an upper unit, but we didn't mind that at all -- a five-minute walk seemed better than being housed in one of the dreary units near the lobby that overlooked the parking lot. Another point (or \"pointe\") to consider: Location of the hotel is not the best for accessing tourist venues (spring training, Scottsdale, etc. ). Overall, the property is dated, but our unit (at least) offered quiet, a comfy bed and a view (albeit of suburban sprawl and hills way beyond).

Incidentally it is pronounced \"tap\" as in ...'Golly, he is a good tap dancer.\" and \"patio\" as in St. Patrick. I find that pronouncing correctly the name of whereever I choose to lay my body down for sleep makes my lodging stay all the more delightful. Yes, I run the danger of sounding like a lodging snob but that's me and I can't help it. What's there not to like about the the place? Beats me. I had a suite with a living room with a couch and 2 chairs, a desk with internet hook up, a wet bar, entertainment center with a TV. The vestibule with the bath on one side and the sink on the other led to a very spacious bedroom with twin queen beds, another TV, plus a balcony that provided a splendid view to the north of the valley and mountains. Terrycloth robe too. The staff? ...a more congenial, helpful group you will not find. The only minor glitch is I had a little trouble finding my room initially but that was mainly because I am part of the great fraternity who do not like to ask for directions even though they gave me a map and directions. I've read the complaints about the parking. You're not going to find your typical parking lot here with herringbone spaces on a flat surface. In fact hilly parking outranks flat parking at this resort by at least 2 to 1. . They don't call it Tapatio Cliffs for nothing folks. For people who are not fond of walking a little or flat out hate it..especially uphill..then I can understand because you may have to park a little ways. But didn't I read somewhere where the Surgeon General highly recommends excersize like walking? The farthest I parked from my room was less than 75 yards. I've stayed at other hotels where it seemed that long just getting from my room to the elevator. For me the walking was a plus ...not just for the exercise but walking in a beautiful setting of Spanish architecture in natural southwest surroundings.. I particularly liked the heavy breathing hike to the top of the Pointe where you get a fabulous view of the city. Then there are the swimming pools...they are all over the place. I had one just a few steps from my door. I had come to Phoenix to take in Mariner spring training in suburban Peoria so when I got back after baseball and sightseeing it was a little too cool to take a dip so I can't give you my take on that but the pools looked inviting and they have waterfalls that cascade from one pool to another. There is even a water slide...so needless to say for kids this is a very cool place. There are also tennis courts and a golf course. I liked it that you could walk right off the resort property smack dab onto a desert hiking trail. I checked it out at dawn one morning and met up with some sociable rabbits. Another unexpected bonus..because Arizona had more than its share of rain this winter there was an abundance of wildflowers on the trail. The Pointe is like a Spanish village stuck velcro like on a hillside with fountains, tastefully landscaped, manicured lawns and gardens with all kinds of cacti, trees, and lovely flower beds. The Pointe has restaurants and bars. You have a Walgrens, MacDonalds, gas stations, and two supermarkets less than a mile down the hill on 7th. Unfortunately there is but one sit down restaurant in that neighborhood...Pinky's Cafe. I had breakfast there one morning (I was but one of two patrons in the restaurant ...a red flag I chose to ignore) and my scrambled eggs seemed to take forever to prepare no doubt coming from incompetant chickens so I would suggest you avoid the place. On the other hand Eddie and Mike's Pizza next to A.J''s Foods (in the strip mall to your left just before the traffic light at the bottom of the hill) is not only the most immaculate pizza parlor I have seen in a month or so but the pizza is very good and is alledgedly the \"world's best\". I don't know about that but it is tasty and besides, the poeple who serve you are nice.

We got a package deal thru Costco Travel for around $550 for 3 nights. The beds were extremely comfortable. Be sure to ask for a room near The Falls if you have kids, as this place covers a lot of real estate and has hills and stairs. The restaurant near the pool had excellent food (from the kid stuff, burgers, exotic drinks to the spa-like salads) and the service was above average, especially Summer. The prices were quite reasonable. The restaurant near the golf course had very tasty food, but the service was a bit slow on both mornings and the one night we ate there. They seemed to be short staffed in the mornings. The breakfast buffet was outrageous at $18 for adults, but a steal at $5 for kids. The quality of food on the buffet was very good. We ate at the Mexican restaurant one night and it was reasonably priced, good service, but the food was only okay, not great. It was more of a sports bar atmosphere. The pools were very clean, uncrowded, plentiful and beautiful. We loved hearing the waterfalls. We took one look at the water slide and did not try it. It appeared too narrow for adults, and our girls were not interested in a dark fully enclosed black pipe. There were 2 boys around age 11, who were really enjoying it, however. We liked that we were able to borrow tennis rackets and balls and introduce our kids to tennis. They let us take the kids for a ride in the golf carts, also for free. Both my dad and my husband went for a 4 mile hike around a butte right from the door of the hotel. They said the views were very nice. Down the street a bit is a Starbucks, Target, Chili's, Boston Market, El Pollo Loco, and Sonic Burger. We also did a day trip to the Squaw Peak Point Hilton where there are reciprocal privileges. We had a car so we drove, but they have free shuttles between the hotels available. The Lazy River was as warm as bath water and only 3 ft deep (safe for our 6 year old). The current kept us going for about 15 minutes around the loop. We were not charged for the inner-tube. It was also not very busy at this Hilton. We played some miniature golf, and again no charge. Their water slide was fun for my 9 year old, but she said the water was cold (it was only around 65 degrees air temperature that day).

There is no natural beauty anywhere to be found. The hillside suites are small, offer no view except of the parking stalls and other buildings. The views you do get are of the burb's rooftops, lots of city lights at night. Hiking trails lead to dirt paths... I have seen the desert, this isn't it. The highway runs right past it... it is NOT REMOTE in the sense of being off the beaten path, it's just inconvenientley out of the way. There are residential subdivisions and strip malls at the bottom of the hill. You might as well be half way up the space needle in Seattle. What ever desert terrain is left is devoid of life. I'm sure at one point, this was a wonderful spot surrounded by natural beauty but unfortunatley urban sprawl has taken over. The resort has not aged well either. The rooms are terribly outdated in decor, layout and size. Even the \"updated\" rooms have a bandaid feel with their mismatched furniture... this was done on the cheap. Everywhere I looked, I saw cheap fixes... the fountains patched with cement, the lobby terra cotta floor painted over to look new!... layers of paint everywhere...nothing flowed. Now if all this didn't catch your eye AND you got a cheap web rate (perhaps something you would pay at a 2-3 star hotel), you probably gave this place a positive review.

I could have paid the same price and stayed at the Wig Wam (also an older resort but gorgeous) but was seduced by the phony marketing on the Pointe Hiltons' web site... thinking I was to expect 4 star quality... It looks good on the net but reality bites! The golf course is well manicured but it too has fallen victim to urban sprawl...traffic noise and backyard walls everywhere... too bad...it has some nice holes in the hills. We checked out early after 3 days of sunning and golf (that we did enjoy) and headed east to Fountain Hills. Ended up in the gorgeous Inn at Eagle Mountain...paid less too!! There are just too many better places to stay in Scottsdale and area that provide the 4-5 star experience. I've been on budget vacations and extravagant vacations...

The parking spaces in front of your room were compact, and nobody took care of your luggage!

The sink's not even in the bathroom, it's in a scary place, and the room with the toilet and shower/tub was extremely cramped. The shower was pretty bad, but the toiletries were okay.

Our 2nd room was better, but still had a bit of that musty smell, which the staff said comes from the A/C when a room is unoccupied for awhile. Our other disappointment was dinner at their La Cantina Mexican restaurant, where the cheese had an odd (cheap) imitation-cheese taste and texture. If you are traveling with children, then the water park and reasonably priced 2-room suites (we paid $104 on an August weekend) may override any other factors.

I'm really ease to please I usually never complain but we had a running toilet that I had to call about several times. I also didn't love our view. We overlooked a parking lot.

The pools are great for families. In short here is what you should stay away from @ \"The Pointe\" and here is what you should enjoy. Don't go to there Mexican restaurant.

Reading some of the other reviews might make me choose a different location. But some of the reasons we choose this again and again are the very reasons why others disliked it. To each his own, I guess. We love the fact that this resort is on a cliff side - you can go any city and stay in a hotel that has rooms side by side down a hallway with an elevator. This one has meandering walkways and driveways with various sized buildings scattered over the side of the mountain. We actually stayed quite close to the Falls pool but took 1-2 walks everyday just to explore the grounds - my kids loved it and we went a different direction everytime. The kids were never bored there - lots of activities or just playing in the water. We have recommended this place to over 10 families over the years and all have loved it. Also, be sure to visit the pool at Squaw Peak - more of a 'water park' and quite busy - but again, the kids will love it! True, the prices aren't cheap, but we always go over spring break - the prices aren't cheap anywhere Phoenix - but that is what you have to pay to get out of the snow! Mini-bars are what you would expect in any hotel - if you don't want to pay for them, don't use them! Pools are all for no additional charge. The only \"resort charge\" is for the fitness center and tennis courts. We used both of these everyday - well worth the $9 per room fee! Restuarants are typical hotel cost and quality. Again - what were you expecting? We ate breakfast there everyday because we were anxious to get to the pools and activities for the day. At night, we generally chose to go \"off-campus\" and experience someplace else. Phoenix is not so big a town that you can't drive to very nice places within a short time - and while you are driving it gives you the chance to see the rest of the city.
