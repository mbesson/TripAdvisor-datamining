The sink had toothpaste on it, and the bathroom door was spattered with a large amount of dried soap. We didn't have an ironing board, or a working alarm clock. So I left a note for the housekeeper, but it wasn't acknowledged. So I took my complaints to the front desk, and was told the housekeepers don't speak English. They did give me a different alarm clock, but it took a couple of days to get an ironing board. I did speak to the manager, and showed him in an empty room, just what my concern was about the dirty doors. That empty room also had the soap splatter. He said his housekeepers are \"top-notch, and he stands behind them.\" He did offer to send a housekeeper to my room. The hotel has one computer for the guests, but the keyboard was very dirty. I asked the housekeeper to clean it, and she said she would as soon as she could. Didn't see it happen. Not everything was disappointing.

We were in room 221, if they put you in that room ask to be moved immediately. It was the loudest room I have ever stayed in. The elevator is on one wall, the housekeeping closet is on another and all water movement is audible in the walls.

The internet was free and wireless. SO I finally used my laptop, went on to youtube and found a video of a waterfall that I played on a loop. That kind of worked. The breakfast buffet was nice. Scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, pastries, juices. But the room was chaos. The attendants were scrambling trying their best to fill up the food, they seemed kind of harried and brusque.

They said, It is taken care of and gave me two confirmation numbers. When we checked in they gave us rooms on two different floors. My wife would not have that so she complained and they gave us rooms across the hall from each other. Things were fine after that with one exception. I was viewing my bank account on line several days later noticing the two $118.00 fees that were billed to my account. Then I saw three (3) $100.00 charges deducted from my account ($300.00). I called the holiday in manager to inquire about the obvious mistake. She told me it was for smoking fees and told me that we smoked in the rooms. \"We did not smoke\". I asked her why there were three fees. She said I stayed in three rooms; 440, 442 and 444. She said she found cigarette butts. I informed her that I did not even stay in room 444. She insisted that I did. She finally said she will credit $100.00 for room 444. It is now August 3, 2009 and I still haven't received credit for the room I was supposed to have smoked in that I didn't even stay in and was not billed for. If you smoke and carry cigarettes in a shirt pocket please don't use the express check out at this hotel. Check out in person and make them go look at the room you are checking out of.

You can shut the door between the two rooms. This also worked well for after the kids went to bed and my husband and I could watch a movie on our side. The continental breakfast was convienient, although monotonous. The pool was clean and my children used it several times. Our room actually looked over the pool, but did not find it to be a noise problem. Decor was fine and the room was clean, but not outstanding. The walls are thin and our neighbors were noisy, even at 4:30 in the morning. A big downside was the humidity in the room. We couldn't seem to get rid of it. It was so damp, dry paper would become damp and flimsy over night just sitting on the desk. Also, our entire floor had a musty smell that didn't go away. We saw the hotel staff cleaning the hallway carpet 4 times in the same spot and kept a fan on it 24 hours a day. That might have contributed to the smell, which did get to me after a while. I would recommend this hotel if you are traveling with young children, but not for adults traveling alone or as a couple.
