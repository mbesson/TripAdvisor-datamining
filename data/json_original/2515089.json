The weather was wonderful which is when the hotel really comes into its own - it was brilliant to sit at an outside table in the courtyard with a book and a glass of wine after a full day's walking around Paris (you can buy a coffee if you prefer). I had breakfast a couple of times because the sun shines from morning until nightime on the courtyard - it's as nice as you will get locally and they will refill if you ask. The staff are universally very friendly and helpful. I had a room in the garden annexe which was a good size and quiet (the hotel cannot be held responsible for, thankfully, the occassional ill mannered guests). The hotel is in a fab area and busses (and the metro if you must) will take you anywhere you might want to go. I cannot recommend more highly the restaurant L'Ecurie which is a few minutes away from the hotel on the rue Montagne St Genevivie - it's not flash by any stretch, but the meats are grilled over an open fire and are gorgeous.

It was lovely. I will attach a few pictures. I don't know the layout of the other rooms but ours had two twin beds, close to each other, but made separately and we did not feel like we were \"sleeping in the same bed\". It also had a recessed desk and chair, small round table with two chairs, a recessed wardrobe, extra pillows and blankets, two small night stands with lamps, a phone, a decent sized bathroom (watch that step into the tub, it is a big one), good water pressure, and hair dryer. Each day we had fresh towels and they supplied soap, shampoo and little glove type wash cloths. The wall paper was floral and we loved it. Our window (no screens of course) opened to the courtyard which was a wonderful cobblestone area with plantings of beautiful azaleas, primroses and other flowers, and tables and chairs. The hotel was actually two buildings. The registration area was in the other building, the same as the breakfast room. We had interactions with at least 4 different front desk people plus the breakfast room lady. They were all friendly, helpful and gracious. We only had breakfast there one day as we were out and about so much. It cost 9 euros each and consisted of half a baguette, a croissant (both large), a pot of hot coffee, a pot of warm milk and butter and jam. It was delicious. Our room was 135 euros a night. We could have found something less expensive I am sure but this place was so charming I am glad we stayed there. The only downside IF you want to be picky is that the walls are thin but who cares. The area is chock full of restaurants and little shops. It is close to Rue Mouffetard, the Pantheon, Rue Des Ecoles. The metro stop was a long block away. We only took the metro 3 times (to Eiffel Tower, Sacre Coeur, and to get to the RER for Versailles). It was very easy to get to the Seine and all the popular spots. The hotel had wi fi so I used my phone to check email and skype back home. We were going to print our boarding passes for the return trip (someone was helping us) but the site didn't work. Fortunately, there was an internet place around the corner that was very reasonable so we used that instead. I recommend this place. Loved it. I didn't rate it excellent because it seems I do so in most of my reviews. In reality it was excellent. Also, no TV - HOORAY!!

The property is gated, once you enter you walk onto the gorgeous cobbled stone entrance way all the way up to the reception, the property has gardens, outside seating area and breakfast room (personally I simply walk out down the road to the local patisserie for breakfast). The rooms are extremely clean ( generally if you stay in a charming hotel, charming is another word for rundown and smelly!) well presented, can be a little small depending what room you get ( however this is the norm in Paris), the rooms have lovely old world decor and oozes charm.

Given all the good reviews, I thought I would see if there were any rooms available. I was only requesting the room a month in advance, so I was very surprised to find they did have room, especially when people advised in their reviews to book far in advance. Location: The hotel is located in the Latin Quarter/5th Arr., which is full of restaurants, shops, and narrow streets very full of Parisian style and charm which are great for wandering. Very close to several metro stops, and only a short walk (15 min) to Notre Dame. The hotel itself sits in a beautiful, quiet garden courtyard just off one of the main roads. The courtyard is locked at night, but guests have an electronic key which gains them access to and from the hotel anytime. The Rooms: Our room was just perfect. Just what we needed and very clean. We stayed on the 3rd floor; our room was accessible via either a small spiral staircase or small lift/elevator. We had a window which could be opened to let in the crisp autumn air, as well as the faint sounds of people practicing piano and violin in nearby quarters. The decor of the room was very French Provincial and fitting. Our furniture consisted of: one double bed (which was comfortable enough), table & chairs, nightstands, and wardrobe/armoire. We also had a full bath, which was very nice. We couldn't seem to get the provided hairdryer to work, but we didn't contact anyone in the hotel for help, as we didn't end up really needing to use it. I'm sure if we had contacted Marie at the desk--or any other employee--this issue would have been addressed (which probably would have ended up being user-error, no doubt...) :o) The size of the room was adequate, and comparable to any other room I've stayed in in Paris. The walls did seem a little thin at times, when late one evening a gentleman was knocking on the door of the room next to ours (while calling out to the person inside), and we could've sworn he was knocking on our door. But this was really the only time we noticed the thin walls. Thin walls, though, are very common in most Parisian hotels (at least where I've stayed). We did not notice an air conditioner, which wasn't an issue for us being that it was a cool October, but the heat (especially on the 3rd floor) may be bothersome in a summertime-stay at this hotel. Staff: Everyone working at the hotel was very pleasant and patient with us. We communicated in French as far as it would go, and where our French ended, they gladly communicated with us in English. Everyone was very accommodating, answering our questions and offering travel/sight-seeing advice to us when we asked. They did offer breakfast (coffee, juice, croissants & breads) which cost 9 euros per person per day. We found that the nearby restaurants offered about the same thing for the same price, and this is the option we chose, as we liked being out eating at the restaurants and people-watching. The hotel would have been a fine option for breakfast, though. Other Guests: To be honest, most of the guests staying at the hotel that we saw were American, and most guests seemed to be of retirement age, although we did see one family with a couple of adolescents. I'm sure the guests vary depending on when you stay here, but it did seem to have a quieter feel, perhaps related to the guests that typically stay here? It is definitely not a \"party scene,\" but guests seem to be very nice and quietly sociable. I think it would be a great place for my parents to stay if they visit Paris. And I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Paris.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBelieve all the good reviews!\u201d", "Author": "123456735805", "ReviewID": "UR119728940", "Content": "The reviews are correct.

Hidden behind a huge gate just down the street from where Hemingway lived during the period in which he wrote \u201cA Moveable Feast,\u201d you enter a short cobbled pathway lined with flowering plants and shrubs that seem to herald what is around the corner: three beautiful 3-story buildings that could easily have been moved from the French countryside. It\u2019s location, a short walk to the Pantheon, Luxembourg Gardens, Il St. Louie and Notre Dame, could not be more centrally located. And being situated off the Rue de Cardinal Lemoine, its peaceful countryside solitude is a welcome respite from noisy tourist attractions and crowded museums. The outdoor area landscaped with tables and chairs encourages you to dine al fresco in good weather or sit for a late afternoon snack while writing postcards or reading a book. Though the rooms do not come with \u201cfrig bars\u201d the management does allow you to bring your own food and drinks to their tables and will even offer additional beverages if requested. The individual rooms of which I have sampled 2, are more than comfortable with private baths, suitable lighting, flowered wallpaper, and fans if needed during the warm summer months. The absence of a TV was in my estimation a huge plus as I was there on vacation to relax, not necessarily to be distracted by headline news or dubbed films. However, the real plus to this magical hide-a-way later became evident when first we checked in, and later had breakfast. At the front desk was the most engaging and helpful Marie who happily juggled questions regarding museums, taxis, tickets, weather, train service, you name it, she had an answer. She managed it all through an extraordinarily cheerful disposition. And starting your day off with a bang was Dorota who managed to stand out in a stellar line up of women who alternated serving breakfast. If I could have bottled her enthusiasm for life, I would have happily tried to get it through customs, but instead, I just wallowed in her energy which was the perfect way to begin each new day in Paris. The only down side is getting that reservation, as the hotel is extremely popular and provides a time-line from which you can phone or email your initial request.

What strikes you most about this place is that is in a secluded courtyard, complete with mature trees, and tables and chairs where you can sip your own wine, dine (bring your own food), visit, read a book, etc. Step out the gate into the quiet street, and about a block to your left is the Place de la Contrescarpe, a small and unique square surrounded by restaurants and cafes. Off the square is Rue Mouffetard, a narrow and lively corridor peppered with restaurants, ethnic takeout counters and specialty shops. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Notre Dame, the Pantheon, the Jardins de Luxembourg and the Jardins des Plantes. Our room was in the older building. Very nice, although basic and not exceptionally comfortable. When we were there in 96 they were constructing a new building across the courtyard. We did not see these rooms but would assume they are nicer. The hotel has no restaurant but serves a great continental breakfast (best croissants and baguettes I have had in France), which you can enjoy in the pleasant breakfast room or out on the terrace. The staff are friendly and gracious and will even give you access to the kitchen to chill your wine or borrow some utensils for your patio dinner. The place is quite secure, with access to the street through a huge steel door which is locked at night (ring the staff to get in).

We are spoiled to no end by the new iteration of hotel chic which includes a cloud-like mattress and duvet found in all the major hotels now, so the old-fashioned hard bed was even more noticeable.

Also, please do not bring any outside food into your room.\" Initially, I thought the sign was quaint. However, as we passed said laundromat and saw the prices, I realized that no guest in their right ind would use it over a free bathroom sink. And after perusing the Rue Mouffetard with all it's amazing shops (cheese, cured meats, fresh fruit and vegetables, marinated olives and mushrooms, boulangeries, Belgian chocolates, need I go on???) and realizing that the area was MADE for picnicking, we of course so wanted to have a room picnic to celebrate all the local fare we found on Rue Mouffetard. Alas no, no outside food allowed in our room. I felt a bit like a recalcitrant teenager wanting to rebel, but we followed the rules.

It is a shorter walk to the hotel from the station but the net difference the same compared to walking from Luxembourg. I prefer to stay on the RER B to Luxemborg and walk to the hotel (providing it's not raining). It's fewer stairs than doing the RER/Metro transfer mess.

I will never stay any place else when in Paris. A colleague recommended this hotel and I am very happy that I took the advice. This is an exceptional 3-star hotel. One enters the property through a high wide doorway and finds a wonderful garden with table and chairs. Many rooms in the hotel face this garden area and are protected from the street noise. Some rooms do face a street and so it would be sensible to ask for one facing the garden if you are troubled by street noise. The rooms have a large reciprocating fan in case it is warm (there is no air conditioning \u2013 and some may consider this a disadvantage).

So, in my case, I took the 24 hour card and this was more than adequate for an entire week (and the price was 8 Euros for the 24 hours). The other options: 1 hour for 3 Euros and 3 hours for 4 Euros. The wireless works from any place on the property. Breakfast \u2013 bread, pastry, coffee and juice \u2013 is available for 8 Euros. But, you can also visit nearby markets and buy cereal and fruit if you like and order only coffee and sit in the garden and have what you brig in. Major food is discouraged in the rooms, but something like a box of cereal is OK. The basic price for our room was 130 Euros per night (tax is added), and we thought that this was a very fine price for the quality of the hotel.

But never again for summer. First the good stuff. The garden is wonderful. The hotel has about 40 rooms and there are 10 tables in the garden so we never had trouble finding a spot in the shade for breakfast or just to sit and enjoy. And the hotel is gracious about providing water, glasses for wine you bring in and the garden is a great spot for picnic lunch or dinner from one of the nearby bakeries. The wifi which costs 8E for 24 hours of actual use which is reasonable -- reaches to the garden. The rooms though charmingly decorated are also well past time for refurbishing -- ours looked like someone had had a distressing biological disaster (or perhaps a pet had) and the rug cleaning not entirely successful -- it felt 'clean' but the stains were still disgusting. The wallpaper was stained and worn. But worst of all was our attic room on a hot day. It was 100 degrees in our room and the hallway when we retired each night. The fan provided for the room barely got it into the high 80s or low 90s at night. The skylight in the stairwell if opened might have allowed for cross draft and evacuation of heat but it stayed firmly locked down so all the heat in the building rose to the attic and stayed there. It is unconscionable to book attic rooms this time of year and then not do the rather simple things necessary to evacuate heat. My uncle's farmhouse in the 1940s used a ceiling fan to pull heat out at night -- this is heat management 101. This is a hotel -- the lack of concern for taking the simple steps in air design to make these rooms livable is ridiculous. The nights got cool enough that with adequate airflow, the rooms while unlivable in the day would have been manageable at night. To compound the misery and it was a miserable room in the heat, the elevator went out. I know stuff happens and they were doing their best to fix it -- but when you book a hotel with an elevator and are on the 4th floor (third French) and you are elderly -- you don't expect to be hauling luggage several flights down. The young man who seemed to be in charge had to be forcefully asked for assistance -- his general approach to old people with the luggage problem because of his failed elevator was 'oh I wish we had a bellboy for times like these'. He did finally reluctantly assist with the larger suitcase. The hotel has its charms. Breakfast in the garden while the usual overpriced skimp of Paris is lovely because of the garden.

If you're looking for modern, business-style comfort, this is probably not the place for you: you have no DSL, no real WI-FI except through paid cards in the crowded, fairly claustrophobic breakfast room, no lobby, no business facilities of any kind, no safe in the room, no fridge, no TV, no coffee pot.... Breakfast is not included and is fairly standard: coffee, juice, bread, croissant and nothing much comped. A couple of thousand dollars later, maybe they'll offer you a hot tea while the room is being cleaned.

Our room was upstairs at the end of a hallway. The walls had a lovely floral pattern, the bedspread was a woven white cover and the room had slanted ceilings that added to the coziness. The window opened to a leafy private courtyard. The bathroom had thick tiles and a tub/shower combo. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as we preferred the bakery, but we did carry back a picnic dinner and ate in the courtyard one night.

We had a museum day covering Notre Dame towers, St Chappelle, Cluny, Rodin, Louvre and my favorite Musee D'Orsay.

No TV, no minibar, no Sky magazines, no lounge/bar with CNN news pumping round-the-clock from a blurry plasma - bliss! Just the birds singing and the occasional rumble of a suitcase down the garden path outside. Could this really be the centre of Paris? For those who can't go without gazing at a screen for 2 whole days, there was wi-fi - but who needs that when you have all the sights, sounds and smells of one of the world's most atmospheric and exciting cities all around you? What the hotel did offer may have been simple, but it was immaculate, very French, and beautifully presented. As for the location, we disagree with those who have described this laid-back and slightly bohemian neighbourhood as touristy. On the contrary, it was a little rough at the edges, full of students and academics (being at the heart of university land) and local characters. One place they gathered was in the cafes and bars in a little square minutes from the hotel. We could dine and drink anywhere, dressed casually in jeans, and feel totally relaxed and at home. The Rue Mouffetard buzzed with colour, smells and life. Gourmet cheese stalls, posh chocolate shops and olive oil delis jostled for space with ritzy student bars and takeaways, fruit and veg stalls, chic fashion boutiques and charcuteries - all of which seemed to be open all hours. But we also explored further. 15 minutes' walk took us to the fascinating botanical research centre of the Jardin des Plantes, and the river. Just over the bridge was the charming Ile St Louis, and one more bridge took us to the Ile de la Cite and Notre Dame - now you're talking touristy! A quick look around there was enough, then over another bridge to the magnificent town hall, the Rue de Rivoli and its many shops, and beyond that, many moe attractions. We just about walked our feet off. But in the evenings, it was good to come back to our tranquil haven in the Latin Quarter.

I felt that I owe it to trip advisor to do my part since we have stayed in so many nice places after consulting with all the reviews on tripadvisor. So, sorry for the long intro, back to Hotel des Granges Ecoles. The hotel is located in the very charming and best walking neighbourhood in Paris, the Latin Quartier. The location is perfect as you can walk to the Metro (a fair distance but not unmanageable and also nice given the lovely neighbourhood). The reception is efficient and as the hotel has its own parking,it is very convenient if you are with children. The hotel has its own garden, so the kids can safely run around. The rooms are charmingly decorated in lovely french theme and colors. Despite its location, the rooms are really quiet! Hot water shower was good and bathroom came with bath tub which the kids love to soak in esp during winter and when you have walked so much visiting the many sights in paris. There is not lift/elevator so you have to carry heavy luggage up the stairs, so ask for lower floor rooms if you prefer not to deal with heavy luggage. There are tons and a great variety of restaurants & takeways literally 1 min away at reasonable rates, and you can dine with kids. The supermarket is also nearby. The breakfast at the hotel was 9 euros which includes good hot choc / coffee, juice, delicious croissant and generous servings of bagette and butter and lovely confiture/jam...

The hotel had some problems with our reservations. I was traveling with my parents (same last name) and we booked 2 different rooms, separately. When we arrived at the hotel they only had one room available under our last name. They confused our reservations, thinking that we were the same person, an honest mistake. Thankfully we both had email confirmations of our reservations and within a couple hours (and a yummy breakfast that they gave us), they came up with another room (as the hotel was full). This room, we believe, is not normally a room they rent out. It was in the back lower portion of the hotel and was basically a small apartment, with a kitchen and living room. My parents stayed in that room, so I can not speak on their behalf. The room I stayed in was in the main building where the lobby and breakfast room is located. I can not remember the room number, but it was on the 4th floor, I want to say 416. The room was well appointed and very clean. A comfy queen sized bed with a beautiful bedspread. The walls were covered with cherub wallpaper. Each side of the bed has a nightstand with lights and a telephone. There was also a table with 2 chairs by the window, which had a great view of the buildings in the area. The closet was big enough for my large suitcase and all my clothes with room to spare. The bathroom was a really nice size with a big tub and shower. There is a hairdryer in the bathroom, but as I soon found out is not very strong and I have long thick hair, so it took about an hour to completely dry my hair. There was no clock in the room, so I recommend bringing a small travel clock. The front desk can arrange for a wake up call \u2013 which I recommend because it plays cute music including Happy Birthday :) There is a small elevator, which just fit myself and one suitcase \u2013 I am not a large person! I used the stairs most of the time. Like I said when we first arrived and there was the confusion with our rooms they gave us a complimentary breakfast, otherwise we had breakfast one other time when we were in a rush one morning and didn\u2019t have time to walk around and find a caf\u00e9. The coffee was strong but good and served with warm milk (a nice touch). The breakfast is not the typical American eggs, bacon and pancakes. It is a piece of French bread, a croissant with jelly and butter. I definitely recommend going to one of the many bakeries in the area and getting a \u2018Pain au chocolat\u2019 which is a croissant with chocolate in it\u2026 very yummy! Eating breakfast inside is nice, but if the weather allows, take advantage of the tables in the courtyard. A nice feature is that with your room key is a key swipe device that allows you inside at night, as they lock the big green doors after a certain time (I think it was around 10pm). I felt very secure knowing that no one besides people staying there was allowed inside at night. When I was leaving, I planned on taking the metro back to the airport as we did when we were arriving, however and thankfully, Marie at the front desk, while I was checking out, asked me how I was getting to the airport and advised that parts of the metro were not running because of a strike. She then made a few quick phone calls and got me on a shuttle taxi that picked me up at the hotel in time to catch my flight. I am forever grateful to her for that help! All in all, this hotel is beautiful and made my trip to Paris very enjoyable. After long days of walking and sightseeing it was a wonderful place to retire.

The hotel was just about exactly as I expected, even better in some ways. I hope my review and photos will provided the kind of info I looked for myself. First, to get it out of the way, the only negative thing--and something I had worried about after reading other reviews--was a reservation hitch. When we arrived, we were told our room would not be ready until the next day and we'd be spending the first night in a different room. This was not awful; the room (on the garden level) was lovely though smallish. The only annoying part was that we couldn't unpack yet. The \"real\" room was indeed ready the next morning, early enough that we didn't have to wait around. It seemed to me that there was quite a bit of this room shuffling going on, but I didn't notice anyone upset or ruffled. Our \"real\" room was upstairs along the cobblestone walkway. There was a bit of noise from other guests' rolling luggage and voices but nothing intrusive. Next time, I'll request an upstairs room off the courtyard instead--maybe a bit prettier view, though I have no complaints about ours. Our room, 147, was much larger than I was expecting (and I strongly recommend paying the higher rate for the better/bigger rooms--the rates are so reasonable that it's worth a little stretch), with a little alcove with a couch, table, and chairs and two big windows. Pretty wallpaper, very comfortable bed, good linens (changed daily), clean modern bathroom with shower (good water pressure), decent-sized closet where we fit all of our stuff (except for the empty suitcases). The hotel staff is very helpful, including offering advice on restaurants (we highly recommend La Volcan, just steps away--we went twice), calling taxis, and so on. The breakfast was fine: croissant, baguette, coffee, juice. We took it maybe half the time, mostly for the convenience. The courtyard was beautiful; we had a great picnic dinner on our first night, with food and drink collected at five different shops on nearby rue Mouffetard, a fun market street. The Metro station is close and convenient. Also nearby is Arenes de Lutece, an ancient Roman arena now used as a public park by young soccer players and not-so-young boules players (and beer drinkers)--a fun slice of Parisian life.

We could sleep with the windows open to the pretty courtyard and the lovely cool September air and it was all very nice. Technology seems to have passed them by - no CNN or BBC for English-speaking relief at the end of a busy Franglaise day and, goodness me, no internet.

None of these bothered us in fact they added to the charm of the place and i'd deffinelty try and book it again the next time i'm in paris but judging by its popularity on TAdvisor i'll probably have to book a year in advance.... i found some grat bars and restaurants in the area too if you want to message me about them", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, CA", "Title": "\u201cTranquil Setting within The Latin quarter\u201d", "Author": "sfpd192", "ReviewID": "UR16831878", "Content": "The Hotel Des Grandes Ecoles has been a favorite hotel of my parents for as long as I can remember.

The buildings that make up the reception and rooms are off the street down a quiet, private courtyard, which leads to a fantastic garden ripe with shady trees and outdoor patio tables. Despite its location in the heart of the hectic Latin Quarter, the nightime noises of the revelers is non existant. Our room was nicely appointed and very spacious with a modern, and large bathroom. The hotel was close to many recommended dining options and needless to say we did not have a bad meal in the area. There are also plenty of bars and cafe's within two blocks of the property to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. If the bar scene is not for you, the garden was constantly packed with patrons reading quietly and sipping glasses of wine which could be bought at the convienence store one block away. Most of the main attractions of Paris are within a few miles walking distance and there was a Metro station two blocks away from the hotel which easily transported us to Montmarte and the Sacre Couer. If you are looking for a modern hotel this is not the place for you (I.E. No television in the room.)

I had no difficulty whatsoever becasue the confirmation included exact travel information. That was invaluable. I only paid 8.5 euros for the trip one way. The walk to the hotel was easy and along a well lit public street. The entrance to the hotel is secured behind garden walls and absolutely beautiful. The pictures from their web site are representative of the property; so there is no dissapointment. The registration porcess went smoothly. My room was lovely.

The room was as tastefully appointed as the public areas of the hotel and had a view to the gardens and courtyard.

The property was pristine clean. Bed linens and towels were what would be provided in a highly rated hotel. Room lighting was above par. Electrical outlets were strategically placed. The shower gave a generous water stream. I traveled alone and felt secure with treatments to windows ,and the courtyard was locked at the street. Guests have access via keys and intercom. One major reason for selecting this property was its proximity to attractions that I wanted to visit. I did not want to spend time or money in city travel. Maria (I think), at the desk was wonderful - as were all of the staff. I cannot imagine how anyone could rate the staff to be unfriendly.

I gave the hotel two-week notice of our change of plans and received an immediate confirmation and OK from the front desk.

The check-in was smooth, we had a comfortable, nicely decorated room on the second floor with a great view of the courtyard. Now, we did not go to Paris to watch TV or hang out in our room so we immediately set out to scope out the neighbourhood. To our great surprise, we discovered Rue Moufftard and it's market and shops with Cafe Marc serving one of the best and least expensive coffies in Paris. We found a seat every time we visited (there is no take-out coffee here - sit and enjoy). While strolling, we ate a croissant or a goodie from one of the numerous neighbourhood bakeries so breakfast was always exciting and new. I thought the breakfast at the hotel was pricey so we just found other alterernatives. For lunch, we again picked up something from the market and ate back at the hotel in the lovely courtyard, surrounded by the lovely scents, bird songs as well the the sound of the childrens' choir coming from the nearby school.

My wife and I just returned from four days and I have to say it was as terrific as so many dozens of American travellers and travel writers have said. Yes, the rooms are smaller and the walls are not sound-proof. That's true of all older hotels in France. And in this hotel, there are big differences room-to-room. We were first offered a room on the ground floor, but it had only a double bed - too small for us. When I asked for a different room with a bigger bed we were offered something on the second floor that was bigger, had a queen size bed and a full size tub/shower in the bathroom. Big difference -- same price. We stayed in room 134. It was at the end of the upstairs hallway and had a big window that opened over the beautiful central courtyard. When you reserve, ask for an upstairs room. The breakfast was surperb. We didn't take it the first day because the area is loaded with fabulous bakeries. So on the first morning I ventured out in search of rolls, fruit and coffee to bring back to the room. Alas, it is very easy to buy any kind of warm fresh baked good you can imagine in this neighborhood. But they don't sell coffee at the bakeries. One needs to go to a cafe -- take out coffee in paper cups is unheard of in Paris. So the next two mornings we took the petit dejuner at the hotel. The coffee is about the best I've ever tasted --rich and dark --and the croissants were freshly baked. The location is an oasis in a very lively neighborhood at the Rue Mouffetard, packed with cafes, bars, stores and hundreds of pedestrians -- mostly a student crowd. There is a jazz bar around the corner that made noise until about 2 AM on Friday night but was quiet on Saturday night. A few other tips - The Rue Cardinal Metro station is closed for at least the next few months for repairs, which meant we had to use the Jussieu stop and go up the hill on Rue des Boulangers. Taxis - Unlike NYC and other big cities, one cannot flag down a cab on the street in Paris. You need to have the hotel call for a cab or go to a taxi stand. The nearest one to the hotel is at the junction of Blvd St Germain and Rue Monge - a decent walk. We also got to and from the CDG airport on the RER line B using the Luxembourg station on Blvd St-Michel. You get a great view of the Pantheon on this walk and the neighborhood seems very safe.

The walls of the rooms are paper-thin: I heard the elevator (next to my room) all night long, and when the couple next door came in late, I awoke with a jerk positive that someone was in my room (they were not being noisy). The bathroom had one of those narrow folding-door showers where if you drop the soap, there is no way to pick it up with out shutting off the shower and getting out. No tub either. The best linens ever experienced in a French hotel (better than some 4 stars) and the pretty room did not compensate for the thin walls, lack of television, and poor shower/bath. Two other major problems for me: neighborhood and the petit dejeuner. At the petit dejeuner, which was an extra charge, store-bought hermetically sealed in plastic danish are served, which is a sacrilege in Paris! The neighborhood is deserted most of the time - being behind the Pantheon and next to the Paris Department of Buildings.

It was very clean and well maintained, and the bathroom was spotless with plenty of linens and soaps. Although it was not air conditioned, there were two fans in the room, which we didn't need due to an unusually cool week in August (low 60s at night).

First, there is no TV, no minibar, no bedside phone, none of those hotel-like things, didn't see any internet or guest lounge or bar. Just a room, albeit a prettily decorated one with lovely view over the garden which was still colourful in November. The breakfast at 7.50 Euros wasn't as good as I expected although it was okay, whereas the rest of the hotel was so charming I'd kind of expected the breakfast to be sensational instead of just ok.

Spent 4 nights at Hotel Des Grandes Ecoles in the Latin Quarter. This hotel is in an excellent location for all your sightseeing. The rooms are small and very parisien, they are cleaned every day and breakfast is at a supplement if you so wish. We had a lovely time staying here, there is a lovely courtyard to the front and it is very safe and quiet. From our hotel we were only 5 mins walk away from the Pantheon and only 10-15 mins walk from Notre Dame Cathedral. We walked everywhere in paris including the Sacre Coeur, never had to use the metro underground. Our hotel was within walking distance for bars, restaurants etc, highly recommend La Vulcan, food was superb along with the price \u20ac44 euros for two people for 3 course meal, drinks not included but they don't start serving until after 7.00pm. If you are staying in the Latin Quarter and are looking for a pub at night and your french is not the best then go for a quiet drink to The Fifth Avenue Pub on Rue Mouffetard. The barman Roddy is from Glasgow and is a real gentleman, we had the best of craic with him and the other barperson Annmarie from Dublin was lovely. They have satellite tv and show all the big sport events. Its best to shop around for snacks during the day. For breakfast outside of the hotel find yourself a columbas cafe, two teas and croissants were only \u20ac6 euros for two, we paid double that elsewhere. We also used the Le Marche FranPrix supermarkets they were very reasonable for sandwiches drinks etc and then eat them as you walk along or there are plenty of nice places to sit and watch the world go by. If you are going to the Sacre Coeur walk through the Opera District and up through Montmarte it's absolutely beautiful don't take Boulevard Sebastopol, not nice at all. Beware of the guys at the bottom of the Sacre Coeur who will try to stop you and sell you bracelets made from wool strings for \u20ac5 euros a piece, its a rip off but they do it with such charm, that you aren't aware until its too late. Do try to speak the language whilst you are there, in our experience the french really appreciate it if you at least try, even if its incorrect. They will speak back to you in English if you get into difficulty. We only had basic school french but it got us by PS Recommend the Paris Shuttle from Charles De Gaulle airport to the door of your hotel, service was excellent well worth the extra few euros. Traffic in Paris is an experience all of its own, an absolute nightmare especially around the Arc De Triomphe. Paris was everything I thought it would be and more, a truly romantic city and the architecture was superb, we had a great few days there.", "Date": "February 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201ccute, not a bargain\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3120757", "Content": "This is a very cute hotel, but rooms are tiny with no tv, radio, etc. Decor can be a bit much- matching flower wallpaper & bedspread.

The local Place was filled with great restaurants. A metro stop was a block away. Grocery stores were convenient as well as creperies. The only negative was the breakfast.

Hemingway stayed across the street and wrote \"A Moveable Feast\" that talks about his experiences in the neighborhood. Get up early and stroll to one of the many cafes where you can sip cafe au lait and watch the school kids scurrying to school and the shopkeepers washing down the sidewalks in front of their businesses before opening. We had a very nice, large room (#217) with a curtain that you could use to close off the sitting area from the bedroom. Almost felt like a suite. Two windows to look out over the roof tops of Paris. The owner was very friendly (even waved to us one day) but you usually deal with the staff who were friendly and very patient and helpful. They will be glad to give you a cork-screw and wine glasses for the bottle you discovered at the local wine shop. The hotel is halfway between two Metro stops. One runs north-south and the other runs east-west so you can get anywhere in the city easily. It's also about 1 or 2 blocks from a 2000 year old Roman Forum that is now a place to watch the kiddies run around instead of gladiators trying to kill each other. For $119 Euros, I don't think you can do much better. We didn't miss having a TV but a 'frig. would have been nice. No A/C but we didn't need it in September anyway. We skipped the 8 Euro coffee and bread and I just went to the patisserie (1 block up the street) for fresh croissants, then next door to the charcuterie for a selection of quiches (which they will warm for you), then a couple of doors down to the market for orange juice and yogurt and fruit for a lunch snack.

I went looking for some tea for her and they built me a little tray with hot tea on it for her. It was very nice. The rooms was fresh, clean, small, but lovely. We were glad we were there for a short time, because although perfect for lovers, it was too close of quarters for me and my mom. The bf was very continental, but skimpy. The coffee WONDERFUL. I saw someone with juice and I asked for some and found I was charged $4 for each glass of OJ. (apparently, juice was not included in the price of BF) It was very good juice. Mom had two glasses. This was after already paying a pretty substantial fee for BF, and thought this was over the top. We had problems with a calling card we had purchased. The advice they gave me didn't work. Apparently I had been sold the wrong type of card and so... just lost my money. They didn't intervene in any way to help. So I have mixed reviews.
