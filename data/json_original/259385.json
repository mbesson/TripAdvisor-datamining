{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Decent hotel I emailed prior to arriving at the hotel asking them if checking in late would be okay (taking the evening train from Rome). They didn't have an issue. They also booked tickets to the Academia (Michaelangelo's David) and to the Uffizi for me. Keep in mind that you don't need to make reservations (and pay extra) during slow season.The breakfast is simple and adequate (2 cereals: granola and corn flakes; bread and a roll w/jam, nutella/noscita, and honey). Juice and milk. The room they gave me did not have a bathroom and shower, hence I had to use the one in the hallway. Not cool at all.The flat screen TV w/BBC and CNN was alright and the view of the city street was cool.The best thing about the hotel is location. For the following reasons:a) 15-20 minute walk to train station w/luggageb) 5 min walk to internet shop (on Via Guelfa)c) right outside the hotel is a grocery store where you can get fruit and snacks. Very nice.d) 10-15 minute walk to the Duomo and the Campanile.Location is great (and hence the name...hotel centro) and it's not that loud in the evenings which is nice. The walls aren't too thin but you can hear your neighbors when they talk loudly.Seems like a family run hotel, nice people.They ask you to turn in your hotel key when you leave to travel around for the day. Not a big deal.The elevator seems a little scary truth be told but it's really not that big of a deal.I stayed several nights and booked on expedia which had a 50 dollar off internet coupon code for booking 3 nights or more. that was a good deal.", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR129926779", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "elbudgetotraveler"}, {"Content": "Shower drain was slow This was hotel was a bargain, so I was not expecting much.

The oversized keychain attached to the room key was GIGANTIC...it felt like it was 6 lbs ( abt 3 kg)...If you lose this key, I don't know what to tell you.When we walked into the room, I was greeted by a big burn mark on the carpet...a silly sloppy smoker must've passed out and dropped a lit cigar there. There's a safe in the closet, a tv ( with sticky buttons ) and lots of drawer space. The room was pretty spacious.We had a wierd experience with the shower...it was draining so slow that it started seeping through the carpet. The breakfast was pretty average...it was what it was: a holdover meal before lunch. The staff was very friendly and helpful...they even helped us reserve tickets for The Accademia and The Uffizi ( which are walking distance fr. this hotel )With the price I paid, the friendly staff and it's proximity to the major tourist sites, I'm willing to ignore that slow shower drain and cigarette smell.", "Date": "Nov 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR914455478", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MOrario"}, {"Content": "good location, but some flaws Room was clean - bathroom was huge by European standards.

I have just returned from a 3 night stay in Florence with my daughter. We booked the Hotel Centro on line with a little trepidation as it is only 2 star and some of the reviews were less than complimentary. We were absolutely delighted with the hotel. The location was excellent, in a small street a short distance from lots of attractions. The hotel is a bit difficult to find, because, although it had a lit sign outside, the entrance is a pair of large wooden doors with nothing written on them. Once inside, there are wrought iron gates, you press a button and they click open, you then pass through to either a small lift, or use the stairs to the hotel which is on the upper floors. The reception is very small, just a desk, but the staff were pleasant and helpful, although their English was very limited. The room was lovely, spacious, with good beds, extra pillows if needed, plenty of storage space and a safe which didn't cost anything to use. You just set it with your own 4 digit code. The bathroom had a shower cubicle, basin, toilet and bidet, but if you have a serious weight problem then you would have difficulties getting in and out of the shower as it was quite narrow. We were OK but I could see others having problems. From the outside, the windows of the hotel were old with dark wood shutters but inside were new UPVC double glazed units, which kept out the noise but didn't spoil the old look of the street and buildings from the outside. We loved it, we like places with character and have high standards of cleanliness and comfort while looking for value for money. All this was met by this hotel and we'd definitely stay again.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR970244565", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "KMKS"}, {"Content": "The worse experience Ever I am a frequent traveler to Italy. Most of the time, I book my hotel online so I can compare prices and get the information about different hotels and read the review from people who stayed there before me.That is why I chose Hotel Centro, the location was perfect, the price was good and people said good thing about it, but I was WRONG!On arrival, we were forced to stay on the steps for over 30 minutes before we could get in, and when we got to the reception, we found out why. The girl at the reception said they had problem with their guests who did not wanted to move and that is why they had canceled our reservation. I just could not believe it, but she assured us that they had taken care of the problem and we could stay in a 3 star hotel only a block away from them. She called them to confirm the reservation and marked the location on a map.It took us 30 minutes to find the other hotel, because, first of all, the address was wrong, it was not 1 block away, but 4, and the hotel was not a 3 star, but 2 with outside bathrooms, disgustingly dirty and on the main street.They destroyed our visit to Florence since we had to spend the whole afternoon trying to find a decent hotel and we ended up staying at the IBIS at the airport since all the hotels in our budget level were fully booked.I had my sister visiting from the US and wanted to show her Florence and it's beauty by finding a hotel close to the historical section of town so we could easily walk to the places and rest in between. Our entire vacation was destroyed, and we ended up leaving Florence shortly after our arrival.This was just a nightmare and a disgusting lack of respect for customer.", "Date": "Jun 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR822895775", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Farhads_travel_map"}, {"Content": "Wonderful surprise I booked a single room for the bargain price of 49 euros, and I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel has 16 rooms on two floors of an old building in central Florence, 2 blocks north of the Duomo. (The great painter Raphael lived in this building.) It is a winding 10-15 minute walk from the main train station in Florence. I lucked out and received a superior room that had been completely renovated, with new honey cherry colored furniture, wall-to-wall carpet and 13 flat screen TV. The double bed was firm and comfortable. The room was large by European standards and very clean, and there was a full closet with personal safe. The newly renovated, completely tiled bathroom was sparkling clean. The bathroom and especially the shower were very small, as were the common spaces (the lounge has 1 sofa, period). The breakfast room is small, so you may have to wait if you go late. The night manager is wonderful and will talk your ear off at breakfast. There is a great grocery store next door, and the Mercato Centrale is a block away. The only downside is that the rooms receive almost no sunlight.
