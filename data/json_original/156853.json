If your usual level of accomadation is the Four Seasons or Ritz, please go directly to their websites. Still reading? Good. This place is on the best section of beach in Playa. We stayed in an ocean front room, but if your budget says \"garden view,\" please go ahead and make a reservation. The grounds are much better than the pictures and the garden view rooms are actually quieter. Now some important points: The beach in the town of Playa is totally public. It's a very mixed group of wonderful people and a number of families. Pretty much everyone will feel comfortable. Regarding the ocean front room: The ocean is very audible in the ocean front rooms at night. If you're a very light sleeper, or not accustomed to really hearing the ocean at night, you may want to consider an ocean view instead. The staff: They're all very friendly and helpful. But do yourself a favor and get 20 and 50 peso bills. Tips left on the hotel bill don't necessarily mean better service. The rooms: immaculate. They are a little rustic in that there are heavy duty wooden shutters in parts in lieu of glass. However, that is traditional and doesn't make it more noisy or less air-conditioned. Now the honest part: The food is sort of a work in progress. They were trying a mixed menu (one fixed for the meal plan and another with supplimental charges). The breakfast was very good, but sometimes the service seemed a little overwhelmed. Lunches are generally better and what we chose. The two times we had dinner, it was okay, not great. Given the number of great places to eat on 5th, I'd recommend trying them (like Origins across from the main entrance). And the bar....the one with the swings was okay, but one bartender struggled to make a margarita that wasn't sweet. The pool bar was better (where you have breakast - 2 for 1 happy hour). The smell: yes, people have mentioned it here so I'll address it. Unless you are EXTREMELY sensitive to smells (perfume, etc), you honestly won't notice it. However, it did rain one night while we were having dinner well west of 5th Ave (El 10 - Argentine steak house) and WELL away from the beach and that was when it was most noticeable. I have no reason whatsoever to believe there is any problem with the quality of the ocean water. Don't worry about it. Over all, I'd definatley recommend this place, even if you only stay in a garden view room. You'll have a great beach, nice people, a very nice room and a short walk into town.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gibsons, Canada", "Title": "\u201cParadise -Best Beach in Playa!\u201d", "Author": "sunshine182206", "ReviewID": "UR126570055", "Content": "What a gem! This is the perfect resort for those of you who are not into 5 star huge all inclusive resorts. Mahekal is an \"old school\" beach resort and is so unique. It was all about the beach, the hammocks and the relaxing atmosphere. We loved every minute - even when it rained. We had a lovely room ( top floor with palapa roof) with an ocean view on the caribe side. Even though we were only a couple of rows down from the bar, it wasn't too noisy (until our last night which was the beginning of Spring Break - keep that in mind when booking). Great restaurant across the street for those nights you want a change (Origenes) with wonderful Spanish guitar music and the best margaritas in town. We stayed for 2 weeks and never felt like it was too long in one place. Most guests were quite envious of us when they heard we were staying so long! We met many guests who were \"repeaters\" from 4 to 25 years which speaks volumes for how special this resort is. We also have to mention how fantastic the staff are. We had a special bond with Manuel - he provided the best service we have ever had anywhere in our travels! The staff work very hard to make guests happy and we appreciated that. Tip: Get a fridge for 5 usd per day and bring bug spray for night time wandering. For tours in Playa del Carmen we would recommend contacting Mayacan Eco Tours.

After we read all of the positive reviews we booked and could not have been happier. The staff at this resort are phenomenally friendly and attentive. There are half/full board dining options you can select, we opted for half board and could not have been happier as the restaurant in the evenings is actually really lovely. Breakfasts are phenomenal, a few tables outside for al fresco beach-side dining (amazing, especially with a hyper toddler in tow), the food at lunch too was amazing. There are two pools and an outdoor spa to utilize and the beach is beautiful, plenty of sun loungers and beach shade with umbrellas to chooe from. Never at any point did we feel that we were unwelcome with our baby and toddler, which was a huge relief. The resort was hugely popular with European visitors (esp French and Dutch), extremely nice and laid back vibe throughout. As its in the far north of Playa you are about 5-10 minutes walk from the hub of 5th Avenue, but not in the thick of it, which for us was perfect. Surrounded by lots of fabullous stores, bars and restaurants. There are no TVs or telephones in the guest rooms but this was the appeal of it for us.

We had been reading the Trip Advisor reviews for months and thought that there was no way this place could be so perfect. Well it is! We had a second floor \"ocean view\" three rows back and loved it. Only had to use the AC one night ( and that was because of the rare wedding party across the street). The breeze from the ocean was perfect. Rooms are very well done, always clean and stylish. This grass thatched rooms are very similar to ones we had in Tahiti many years ago. The second floor rooms offer a little more privacy and air. As everybody writes, the staff makes Mahekal a 5 star resort. Our shuttle arrived at around 10:00PM and they rushed us to the dinner that they had left open for us and a few other late arrivals. We met Rogelio that night as our waiter and he was fantastic throughout the week. It ended up that he was our primary waiter most days and we were glad that he was. However, all of the waiters were very good ( Eliazar ). Boli helped with dinner plans and arranging the shuttle back home. Uri helped with check-out - insuring that we had coffee and a wake up knock on the door at 4:00AM for our return ( the security guard also helped out with these details ). The half board is a good way to go so that you can enjoy lunches or dinners in town. The pools are small but quite honestly we had an almost private pool for 3 of the 8 days we stayed. Most people use the cabanas at the ocean instead. We did both. The grounds are very well maintained and the gardening is creative.

The best lunch options are the sandwiches, in my opinion. We booked our transportation through the hotel and it was seamless and worth it. The location is perfect. We loved being able to walk through town in the evening, stopping at various places for a drink or two. It had been ten years since our last trip to Playa and the city is unrecognizable from what it looked like a decade ago.

One plea from me to you: Please don't have your photo taken with the baby animals they have on display on 5th Ave. I did a lot of research upon my return because the men trying to get you to pay to have your photo taken with the baby lion said that the little guy was \"on loan\" from the Mexico City Zoo and they had the \"certificates\" to prove it.

We were a little bit sceptical if the hotel can meet our expecations but Mahekal was the best choice for us. Location: The hotel is located at the beach, approx. 10 Min from the 5th Avenida, and not directly within all those fancy beach clubs having loud music all day long. But if you want to go there, it is just a 5-10 Min walk and you can be right in the middle of the party. Rooms: We have chosen the little bit more upscale ocean view rooms which absolutely made our expectations. We had 2 queen size beds (OK, we wanted to have King Size) but our room was huge. The bathroom had Mexican style tiles on the all, walk in shower, hot/cold water was without any issues. Additionally we had a fantastic terrace facing to the ocean front with 2 chairs, 2 hammocks and a small table.Excellent to hang out and enjoy a sundowner. The only thing that we missed was a mini-bar. Food/ Facilities: In Mahekal you can choose if you want to have lunch or dinner. This is totally convenient if you want to dine outside of the hotel or stroll around in the evening. The dinner varies between buffet and a la carte. The food is not five star bur a solid 3-4. You will always find something tasty. The a la carte menue is also a solid 3-4 star. The breakfast has a huge buffet and you can order hot meals. Those are very good and should not let any wishes open. The presentation of the food is also OK, lets say also 3-4 stars. The service both at the breakfast, lunch and dinner is excellent.Even though there are many guest they knew our room number, our favourite drinks and were extremely friendly. We were really happy, that the staff members paid a lot of attention and didn't treat us as if we would be \"any guest\". Excellent!!!

We have stayed at this resort several times with just the two of us, with our boys and with other couples. Every time seems to be better than the last, if that's possible. Our last visit was in early December with friends and we had one of the beach view bungalows. Ours was the second row from the front and right on the pathway leading to the bar. We were upgraded to this one and it had a few extra amenities and upgraded decor pieces. Outside the patio we had two large planters and in addition to the normal hammock hanging on the patio, we had some pretty little lanterns, that staff would light at night, giving a real romantic and beach vibe to our little home. Inside the room we had two double beds, small desk and chair, two large closets, and sweet, stylish bathroom. A wooden, sliding door was the entrance to the bathroom and inside was a funky, metal mirror and wooden pegs to hang towels and clothing. It was updated and just really simple and cool. Keep in mind, if you are a regular at a \"W\" hotel or \"The Ritz\" then this may not be for you. The bathroom is small and simple, and yes, you will have a few tiny, teeny ants once-in-awhile around the sink. It's the beach. Little guys get in and no, you will not die. I love the chunky, wooden blinds that open up to let the fresh ocean air in and sounds of the birds. This resort has all the amenities you NEED. Nothing extra. No tvs, no radios, no clocks, no telephones...it's Heaven. The Beach. Let's get down to business. The Beach. I think the section of beach in front of Mahekal is some of the best in Playa del Carmen. Yes, it changes. In December there were sections of the beach that were just completely gone; right up to the porches of the beach bungalows. But I bet it's already changed again. The beach is just amazing. It's the best place to relax on the chairs under a palapa and people watch. Complete relaxation. And no beach vendors to ask you to purchase something. It's awesome. You can drink, eat, sleep, read, laugh, talk, play in the ocean, love your partner, hate your partner, play frisbee or just be on this beach. Breakfast and Dinner. I LOVE Breakfast at this resort. I've said it before, and I'll say it again,\"It's my happy place.\" I love walking down the beach to the pool area and huge palapa breakfast room or walking down the gorgeous, tiled pathway. Either way you get to take in all the beauty of the ocean and beautiful flora and fauna of the resort. The landscaping is amazing and so gorgeous. They obviously take a tremendous amount of pride in keeping up the appearance of the grounds and it shows. We love sitting poolside and enjoying breakfast outside. You can either order off the menu, Heuvos Motulenos is soooo good! Or you can go inside and select a nice hearty breakfast from the items they have to offer buffet style. Dry cereals, breads, oatmeal, yogurt, fresh fruit, meats, cheeses and fresh fruit juices. I think it is really good and a nice way to start the day. The staff are all sweet, friendly and will do anything for you! I cannot say enough about all of them. They make a simple cup of coffee a real treat. I was really wistful when I enjoyed my last breakfast there, knowing that the next morning I wouldn't have the luxury of walking down the beach to have these wonderful people make my day brighter. The Sunday night Fiesta is really good. Although we spend most of our time experiencing all that Fifth Avenue has to offer, the Sunday night is something that you should do. The array of dishes that are served are all delicious and give you a real taste of some traditional Mexican food. Again the same wait staff are eager to make your Fiesta fun and they love to offer you a \"tequila slammer\" before being seated. It's cute how they watch for your reaction. We love to cheese it up and ask for another! lol The best part of the evening is the Marache band that comes around to the tables and plays. The musicians are extremely talented and have a great sense of humor. When you get into it, they love it and get into it and it's so much fun! Mahekal is truly a place to relax and enjoy yourself and your family. The staff are warm, welcoming and work so hard to make your vacation memorable. I am so excited that I am returning in April.

Mahekal is not spiffy by any means but it is charming, lovely and has many plusses. First, the staff are wonderful. Everyone is friendly and they were very responsive to our requests. The setting is great. We had an upstairs ocean view room which was private and the view was beautiful. The rooms are simple but adequate and the beds (or at least our bed) are very comfortable. The grounds are well maintained and very clean. I did not miss having a tv or phone at all because my idea of vacation is really getting away from the world. The beach is great and is right there. Our only quibble here is that Wifi throughout the complex, as opposed to the bar and the lobby, would be great. The location is good ... far enough away from 5th Avenue to get away from the crowds but close enough to be able to walk there easily. Breakfast and lunch are good. Unfortunately, the two times we had dinner, the food was abysmal. The entrees included in the \"free\" meal are very limited. You have to pay extra for premium choices. Don't waste your money! The food at dinner was not worth it. However, lunches were fresh and delicious. My husband and I both had massages which were wonderful. The bar was a lot of fun. The bar staff was very friendly and efficient. As nice as it was, I would definitely not stay here during the rainy season. The palapa roofs are not waterproof! I was disappointed with the town, especially 5th Avenue which is one long, often tacky, tourist strip. The restaurants on the Avenue are mediocre and way overpriced. Do not bother buying any basics, such as wine, beer, tequila, etc. there as they probably cost half at the grocery store or Wallmart. There are some places to note however. The restaurant directly across the street (Origines) is very good and they had great live music at dinner. The monkey joint up the street is also very good and nicely funky. And there is a nice place at the corner of 38th and 5th to get coffee. If you are looking for upscale luxury, glitz and lots of action, don't waste your time at Mahekal. If you want a laid back and relaxing experience, give it a try. I would definitely come back to the resort.

On the other hand, it is a short walk to the center of town and much better food. *Staff was overall friendly and helpful. Did get the feeling that front desk was very full of themselves and not very accommadating or friendly. NOT SO GOOD STUFF: *ROOMS-yuck, A/C didnt work properly, porch ceiling leaked and you could see the buildup of mold, no fridge, no tv, no phone (they dont want you to bother them), no iron, NO INTERNET SERVICE except in lobby and bar area! OMG this is 2012. Get full service internet! *The first room, 2P we had was small, no drawer space, with tiny bathroom and deck area looked right out into public access! We then took over our friends room when they left early, 1P, same price but their room had large bathroom, large living space, drawers, larger deck overlooking ocean. *Rooms themselves were in need of upgrading. Original workmanship was crappy. Tiles didn't match, tiles were not even or level. I could have done a better tiling job after watching youtube! *HAPPY HOUR bar-SUCKED! where do I begin. Not enough staff, not enough seating, lasted from 5-6. Too early for normal people. NO MUSIC, one TV, 80's style furnishings, inefficient staffing, bartender actually has to write down your drink order, give it to guy at computer to make receipt, make drink, give you receipt and wait for you to sign! In a word the MOST BORING HAPPY HOUR I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED. YAWN FACTOR WAS A 10. ARE YOU ALIVE PEOPLE? *POOL, in need of repair and updating or at least a coat of paint. Hot tube was being used as kiddie pool! Not enough chairs at either pool. Pool not heated. *FOOD-It was at best OK. Breakfast was same everyday! Small buffet with fruit and cereal. You could order eggs any way you want them. Nothing else. Nothing special. Felt like I was home. Lunch was passable with more options. We only did dinner once as it was so bad. I would suggest going into town for dinner. Much more exciting. * People at this resort are so boring. You need to take a pulse. Think they were asleep by 9! Basically don't expect to be living in luxury or pampered in any way. If you want a drink while on the beach, go to Walmart and stock up. It will be faster. Then you have to keep going to bar and ask for ice, but still better deal and service if you BYOB! Also, they nickle and dime you at ever turn.

We wanted a room right on the beach; we wanted to be within walking distance of shops and restaurants; and we wanted a place with some character and on a human scale, not an enormous all-inclusive. Mahekal ticked all these boxes. Food was good (lunch better than dinner in our opinion). Rooms are basic but nice enough (a/c was ineffective, but it wasn't hot enough for us to need it). We had an ocean front which was huge with a lovely terrace right on the beach. We hired a fridge from reception - $5 a day - to save buying ice. Staff were friendly and helpful and good with our children, I have no complaints about service. And the cleaner kept the room immaculate (with incredible towel art!). However - 2 things stopped this from being the perfect choice. One was the smell, which, as other reviewers have mentioned, wafts around the beach and particularly when paddling/swimming in the sea. It's not pleasant, and certainly not paradise. Whether it's sewage or mangroves, I don't know, but just beware if this is likely to bother you. The second thing was noise. We were very unfortunate in that we chose to be in Playa during the BPM dance music festival - which we had no idea was happening until we got there. It went on all day, all week at two beach bars either side of the hotel - Mamitas and Canibal Royal. The relentless thumping baseline drove us crazy and there was no where to escape. The hotel were sympathetic (the staff were going crazy too) and did offer to move us to another room but it wouldn't have helped. Reluctantly, we chose to end our stay early and move on, at our expense. So - just a word of caution.

Although it was more affordable than the beach front units, we liked being set back from the beach and the spaciousness of the room. It was a quick walk to the loungers and beach area anyway. We did not see any nudity on this area of beach as other reviews have mentioned. The room was spacious and airy (no need for a/c which was in the room all week, just the ceiling fan). The room was nicely decorated, had a comfortable bed and had a great walk in shower with a separate room for the toilet. The deck had two comfortable hammocks as well as two chairs and a table. Firstly, we did not have to wear bracelets as the staff at the front desk, dining rooms and beach area know who all the guests are. On a couple of days, there was an odor at the beach, but this is from the mangroves that are not close by and not from sewage. It did not stop us from sitting for hours on the beach. The section of good beach area in front of the hotel was kept raked of any seaweed. Although we are fairly fussy in our choice of good restaurants, we enjoyed the meals for breakfast as well as dinner. Any request to have half a portion or sauce on the side was always met. Although we were happy with everything at Mahekal, the highlight of our stay was the staff. We had two bottles of water set in our room each day which we supplemented with more which we purchased at a nearby convenience store. I appreciated not having a phone or TV in the room. I feel confident, that had family tried to reach us, that staff would have found us if we were any where on the property. There was one computer set up in the lounge to check emails, but most people used WiFi with their own hand held devices in the library. Because we were at Mahekal during New Year's, there were parties and bands down the beach. The noise was not the fault of the resort, and the next time we visit, we would choose to stay other than during a major holiday because we go to bed fairly early. All the staff were great, but especially Rogelio and Juan who took such great care of us in the dining room. Front desk staff, the concierge and the staff in the spa were also wonderful. Even the grounds crew took the time to say \"Buenos Dias\" as they passed. We did have a good hair dryer in our room. We swam a short while in one of the pools, but we came to be on the beach and since we were so comfortable, we did not spend much time at the pool. There were sufficient palapas so we were always able to be out of the direct sun. There was discreet security and we were never approached by vendors on the beach as we had anticipated. The entertainment in the dining room was pleasant. The location was easy enough to walk to the Fifth Avenue and the surrounding streets whenever we wished and this gave us good options for a light lunch or mid-afternoon coffee. This is not a big, impersonal resort. We said \"we pay for what we don't have\"; large crowds of guests, swim up bars, unlimited drinks and the noise that often accompanies these parties.

However, in researching for another vacation, unfortunately not riviera maya, I found myself wandering and checking out mahekal and the various comments and finally wanted to offer my opinions on the resort. I appreciate all of the comments offered for this and other places and have found it very helpful in planning that \"next vacation\", regardless of where it could be. I try to escape the daily grind of life and work in cold wisconsin, so when we had the opportunity to travel again and re-visit playa , choosing Mahekal again was the easiest decision. I guess then that we are Mahekal veterans! Based on most reviews, Mahekal is doing just fine! In my opinion, your vacation and/or resort choice depends on what you are really looking for. Seems simple. If you are looking for the massive all-inclusive resort that spans acres upon acres, mahekal is NOT for you. If you want the obnoxiously loud massive hook-up/dance bar with multiple plasma's tuned to ESPN, Mahekal is NOT for you. You will not find any PGA style championship course, the wimbletonian style tennis facilities, nor the plethera of restaurants offering every cuisine imaginable or the private infinity pool draining into the carribean! What you WILL find is ultimately a memorable vacation consisting of an unassuming, peaceful, and relaxing oasis away from home. In a nutshell Mahekal is simply near perfect. For starters, the staff is truely amazing. From the front desk and the entire supporting staff to the poor bellhops carrying all of our heavy dive gear 3 flights to the top penthouse (#18, highly recommended) you are greeted with familiar smiles and greeted by name (after nearly a year in between vacations!). After wandering the immaculate grounds you are greeted with hugs, not uncomfortable nods of acknowledgement because you are one of thousands staying at their resort. You are now their guest. From Rogelio and the entire staff, they rememebered us by name and familiarity as we reacquainted ourselves with our most recent trip experiences, our families, and jobs and swap stories of their lives as well. The grounds are clean, immaculate, and groomed daily. The rooms (penthouse #18, ocean view #17) were perfect, clean, and simply mexican. Again ... no plasma ... no radio ... no disturbance. Just the crashing waves of the carribean, the occasional geecko on your balcony, and tropical birds singing greeting you in the morning. The food, very good. I recommend, as others, the breakfast and dinner. I NEVER had a meal that was disappointing. Recommend the theme buffet dinner, which has good variety. Also order the lobster off menu if you want for a bit extra or the octopus on the casual lunch menu, which is fantastic. Because you typically get only two meals, you have a great opportunity to hit 5th ave only a short walk away. HIGHLY recommend \"la cueva del chango\" straight down the street from Mahekal, walking distance is only 30 yards, the best restaurant in playa i have been to. Quiet, simple, relaxing, great staff, awesome food no matter what you order. The dive shop, also very accomadating. Greeted once again with a familiar smile from Roman that remembered us from our last trip. This despite going to cozumel for diving for the entire day numerous times ... sorry Roman ... but its true ... cant compete with the drift dives off cozumel and diving palancar! So its simple, the way it should be. Plenty of activity around if you want or even need it. Close, but not too close to 5th ave, tons of shops, bars, restaurants, the ferry to cozumel, all mostly walking distance away, always felt safe. Will be back some day, hopefully sooner than later.

Check-in was a bit slow, but friendly. The resort was undergoing a bit of a renovation so our kids' got upgraded for free to some ocean-view rooms. Our rooms were all simple, quaint, and clean. The beds were super comfortable. There were screens on all the windows as well as AC and ceiling fans (so no bug bites!). The resort is right on the beach, which, for some reason has a sulphurous smell. You get used to it quickly, but still.... The beach itself is quite lovely here. Part of it is a bit too rocky to swim in, but the other part is perfect. It's raked every morning. It's also guarded. Service is pretty good. Laid back, not fussy. Starting around noon, there's usually someone taking drink and food orders on the beach and by the pools. The resort is not fenced off or anything, but it seems safe enough. We used the in-room safes as advised and had no problems. There is complimentary coffee every morning at the bar. The restaurants and food service seem OK, not great (we took the no-food option). Cocktails were rather weak. Not a problem, though, because lots of good restaurants and bars are very close by. In fact, that's probably what we liked best about this place -- the location. Right on the beach, but also walking distance to the \"strip\" of Playa del Carmen. Our teenage kids loved walking into town and checking out the shops and getting snacks. The location also meant that we didn't need a car yet could get to all sorts of great restaurants. In fact, one of the best is L'Origines, which is across the street from the resort's reception hall.

We moved to the Mahekal after one night at another resort and were not disappointed. There was just one room left, but it was great. We were at the back but had nice views of the sea from our balcony. The hammocks are a great touch! We were lulled to sleep each night by the sounds of the waves lapping (or crashing on) the beach and awoken by birds singing and squawking every morning. This place has a real 'outdoors feel', which we thoroughly enjoyed. Breakfast was great. Lots of choice, well-prepared egg dishes, abundant fresh fruit. Too bad about the coffee though. We didn't eat lunch or dinner so I can't comment on the restaurant. The bar has very limited snacks (American-style tortilla chips and 'cheese' dip and microwave popcorn) and isn't cheap, but there's a 2-for-1 happy hour starting at 5 p.m. The rooms are simple, but clean and the beds are comfortable (if you like firm). The rain shower is nice, though the fixtures are starting to corrode. There's plenty of closet space and a sizeable safe, big enough for a laptop. There are screens and hardwood shutters on some of the windows so you can have fresh air in the room without worrying about mosquitos (of which we saw very few). We never turned on the air conditioner. The huts are surrounded by lovely plants and trees which are well looked after by the gardening staff. There's sand everywhere so you feel like you're always on the beach. There were always beach chairs available whenever we wanted them, but that may be due to the less-than-ideal weather. While we were there, several meters of beach were washed away by strong waves and wind. The staff provided good, friendly service. When the rental car company didn't show up at the agreed time and we were unable to reach our travel rep who had made the deal for us, the concierge quickly arranged a car for the same price (which was less than the rental company's published rates). We had a lovely, relaxing stay and would definitely return to the Mahekal and recommend it to friends. On the recommendation of the receptionist we ate at La Cueva del Chango, down the road. We enjoyed it so much that we returned for lunch/dinner several times. Excellent food, creative menu and good service.

After debating whether or not to stay at an all-inclusive resort for some time, I decided to go with something more quaint and was very glad I did. We stayed in an ocean front bungalow directly on the beach and fell asleep to the sound of the waves every night. Location: The resort is located at the beginning of Fifth Avenue, but far enough away from all the noise. It was an easy walk to the 20 block stretch of hustle and bustle. It was extremely quiet and relaxing every night, which helped with our 2 year old who went to bed early. I thought the location was really perfect. Food: I loved that the resort offered half board (breakfast plus one other meal) because we never got bored of the food and were able to take advantage of the wonderful restaurants in Playa del Carmen each day. For lunch, we were able to choose one main meal off the menu (didn't include appetizers or drinks) and for dinner we were served a buffet appetizer and a choice of one of 4 main meals (and dessert). Breakfast was plentiful! There was a buffet to choose from and you were also able to order food off the menu (pancakes, omelets, eggs any style, etc.) Sweet bread, fruit, fresh juice, cereal, yogurt, chilaquiles, sausage, hash browns were all part of the buffet. We never left hungry. Dinner offered a choice of beef, chicken, fish, or pasta and was always delicious. Room: We opted to splurge on the ocean front room and were glad we did. Our room had 2 double beds on a split level and a beautiful bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and the ceiling fan kept us cool each night (we never used the a/c). I loved the organic soaps they provided and the way they created animals out of our bath towels each day. Nice touch! My son really got a kick out of it. If I could change anything about the room, I would add a small dresser with drawers instead of only the 3 shelves and 12 hangers in the closet. Things got a little unorganized over time. I would have also loved a small refrigerator in the room, but someone told me after the fact that they are available upon request. Our bungalow was slightly set back from some of the others I saw, so if and when we return I would request #31 because it was closer to the ocean and nothing was in front of it. The Garden View rooms were about a 1 minute walk to the beach and looked very cute. Staff: The staff was wonderful! They were all friendly and accommodating. We were constantly greeted by everyone and they made us feel very comfortable. Overall, we had a wonderful stay. I would definitely stay there again if we return.

Other meals were good and breakfast was also very nice. I'd highly recommend eating out at least 1 night and would suggest you look no further than Xulam - it's #1 rated for a reason - superb!! The one big negative point during our stay was that my wife left her camera in the bar one night and we've yet to hear if it's been found - totally gutted as it was our honeymoon and had loads of photos from USA/Cuba/Mexico :-( Some improvements the resort could make; (1) light on stairs to rooms on upper level (b) put fridges in rooms (c) add another computer or two in the bar area (d) put in place some system re sun loungers - lots of guests put towels on the loungers then don't turn up for hours - very rude Resort is only a 5 min stroll to 5th Avenue and the shops/bars. Other tips; (a) Tours - we only did Chichen Itza. It's a must see but is a very long day in a bus.

It is simple, understated, quiet, and quaint. There are no phones or tvs in the rooms. There are no long lines at meals or seven restaurants to chose from. There are no huge swimming pools or loudspeakers with games and events. There are no florescent bracelets. There are no crowds. There are, however, individual thatched roof rooms along winding sand paths - each with a little veranda compelte with swinging hammocks. There is a fabulous bar with swing seats (and pool and ping-pong tables) hosted by a darling tender Vicente who mixes great, reasonably priced drinks - always with a smile and sometimes with a joke. There are two beautiful palapa restaurants - one for breakfast/lunch which looks out over the gorgeous beach, and one for dinner that is tucked away in the back of the property that is one of the most beautifully romantic places I have ever been.

First we were reserved and were given a beachfront casita. The room itself was great as was the private porch and hammocks. But we had the one casita that had hazard tape and palapas on their side directly in front of our room. So our beachfront casita ended up really being a view of yellow caution tape surrounding the entire area in front of our room. If we stood up on our tippy toes you could kind of see the water? We politely complained and they acted like it was no big deal and there was nothing they could do or move us to. Mind you we paid a hefty premium for this \"view\". We only spent half of our vaca at this property (4 nights). on the very last day at check out time work crews started taking down the tape and uprighting the palapas. The manager walked over to us as we were on our balcony and said they were taking them down to not obstruct our beautiful view. We explained we were checking out and he LAUGHED. He said it was where they put everything when they were preparing for hurricane Rita. Ok, I get it but that was weeks ago and it was only the stuff in front of our room that was left and what the attitude and lack of any kind of reimbursement bugged. The food for lunch was fantastic and the pool outside of it was amazing with a great view of the ocean. The beach below this area is the place to go for the best seating as well. The main part of the beach is a local favorite so good luck getting a chair and the sea was rough in this area. No snorkeling here unless you are looking for a work out and nothing really to see anyways. The main bar for lack of a better term for it was terrible. The yawn factor is beyond and the staff is terrible. They act like an all inclusive which it's not where they don't care. There is always one guy that is at the end of the bar collecting and looking over receipts and the main bartender clearly can not stand his job. No music, sad little ping pong tables, a out of balance pool table...that's it. I get relaxing vibe but this place is awful. Do yourself a favor and walk over to the place directly across from the lobby. It too has the relaxing vibe but in a great way, amazing service, out of this world food, and overall a great experience. So much better than giving that ridiculous bar at the resort business with their microwave cheese sauce nachos and microwave bag popcorn Don't get me wrong. This place is nice but the service is just ok, the beach is packed and rough, the bar is terrible so the highlight ends up being the lunch place and the pool outside it so it seems like there would be better choices in the area and we will not be returning. The best part about this place is the restaurant that isnt even a part of them across from the lobby and the one stand out guy, Rojelio like Roger he kept saying. He ran circles around everyone else at this resort and saved our stay. And we really enjoyed the person that was cleaning our room. He was so funny and nice. Everyone else could care less.

The front desk is often understaffed, though they are very helpful. The furniture in the bar is very uncomfortable. The bar stools are too high for the bar, the regular seating is quite uncomfortable as well. Not conducive to just hanging out. During our stay, extensive maintenance was being done on the two bungalows next door. This was reassuring in a way--they obviously maintain the property, but it was not relaxing to listen to a chainsaw running intermittently for three to four hours. Also, there was a sulfurous smell coming off of the ocean, the source of we never did identify. It was pretty nasty -- esp after a night out at the clubs.

The room had two hammocks where we spent many afternoon hours when the sun got hot. And the ocean and its sweet sound was always right there. The room was perfectly comfortable and we encountered no mosquitoes and few other bugs at all. Food: I was dreading the food because of what we read. Our experience was that all meals were acceptable. Breakfast was the best, with wonderful sliced fruits all ripe, juices, and great Mexican egg dishes. Dinner was always satisfying, even if the dishes were simply prepared. We ate lunch at the hotel twice and felt it was the least satisfying choice...the dishes were hit or miss. We preferred to lunch at La Cueva Del Chango right down the street, which was extraordinary. Service: Our waiter Jose works like every shift and he went out of his way to say hi during our 5 days there. We'd see him at 730am working breakfast and at 7pm at dinner. We always gave him and the rest of the staff tips...they all work really hard and were always friendly. The only knock is that during our 5 day stay the ocean smelled like sulfur about half the time. It may be coming from Cozumel, but it wasn't pleasant. Mostly it wasn't an issue for us but if this is the kind of thing that is a dealbreaker for you you should call them and ask about it.

Turns out it was exactly what we wanted - smaller, quiet resort, with good beach, and walking distance to downtown Playa. Access to downtown/5th ave was an easy and safe walk; convenience store close by for water, beer, cooler, etc. We stayed in one of the Caribe rooms - was perfectly fine, nothing fancy - 2 queen beds, and the hammocks are a very nice touch. We knew there would be no phone or TV, but not having those really did add to the relaxation factor more than we had anticipated. Breakfasts were very good....lunch and dinner too, especially when they had a buffet - good selection, and still fresh. In the general the staff were all extremely friendly and always willing to help. The front desk was a little understaffed at times, but again, they were extremely helpful whenever we needed anything. The grounds were absolutely beautiful - very \"natural\" looking, but always well manicured. Beach was terrific, soft white sand - as we took walks down the beach, noticed that all the other hotels were either extremely loud (club music) and/or all the beach chairs were crowded all next to each other. At Mahekal, you get some personal space, a quieter part of the beach (with some locals there - it is near a popular beach access spot - but that was never an issue), and never had a problem getting a couple of chairs under a palapas. Have to agree with others - probably one of best beachfront locations if you want to stay away from the mobs, but be in striking distance of the action....If/when we get back to Playa, will be back at Mahekal!!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, United States", "Title": "\u201cBest Place to stay in Playa\u201d", "Author": "Johanna R", "ReviewID": "UR120338933", "Content": "My husband and I got married at Mahekal Beach Resort.

We are already dreaming of our next visit. There are so many things we loved - where do we start? Best beach location in Playa...on the quieter northern end - no blaring music or mobs of people. We were always able to get a couple lounge chairs under a palapa umbrella in the shade. The surf was gentle - some days the surface of the ocean was almost as smooth as glass. Breakfasts were great - all you can eat from the buffet plus you can order a hot entree off the menu (omelets, pancakes, French toast and several hot Mexican entrees). The breakfast buffet included breads, pastries, cereal, oatmeal, sausage, home fries, fresh fruit, yogurt, granola and 2 different types of fresh squeezed juice each day (my favorite was the watermelon juice!). A special shout out to waiter Rogelio, who was beyond sweet and made us feel like instant friends. We opted for lunch instead of dinner for most meals and walked into town for dinner each night. At lunch, we thought the shrimp and fish tacos were great, as was the fish sandwich and Mexican platter. The one dinner we had at Mahekal was mediocre. A note regarding beverages: coffee and juices are included with breakfast, and each room gets a 1 liter bottle of spring water/day. Otherwise, you must pay for all beverages, including bottled water. Great restaurants we visited for dinner in Playa: El Fogon, Carboncito's, Baremar, Como Como and Piola - absolutely AWESOME food at all of these restaurants. We were very happy with our upper level Gardenview Pueblito room. This section is more quiet and private than other sections, and the rooms appear to be larger than the more expensive ocean front rooms (we peeked in a couple vacant ones). The bed was comfortable by Mexican standards, and the linens and pillows were soft and comfy. The AC and ceiling fan cooled the room off very efficiently and we appreciated the safe to store our valuables. The only down side to the room was the shower. The water pressure was practically non-existent (picture trying to get a shower standing in a light rain shower outdoors), and the temperature took a long time and a several minutes of fiddling, to get right. The staff at Mahekal are all helpful and friendly and the cleaning ladies do an awesome job and always leave adorable towel art every day. 2-for-1 happy hour from 5-6 p.m. was a real treat every day (and a nice bargain!). The swimming pools were beautiful, albeit chilly, so we mostly stuck to the beach for swimming. Helpful tips: ask the reception staff for a small refrigerator ($5 extra/day) and go to the Mega supermarket to stock up on beverages and snacks. When in town, pay in pesos to get the best price. There is an ATM in the Mega supermarket - put in your ATM and get pesos. You can also purchase liquor at the Mega and at Walmart in town. The front desk can book a transfer/taxi for you back to the airport when you are ready to leave for $55 USD. One more tip: although a 10% tip is included for the wait staff, do tip more.

We had a deluxe room right on the beach with a private plunge pool that we loved. Staff, especially Jose, were for the most part friendly and helpful. There were a few things however that could have been a little better. Firstly, as I mentioned we had a great bungalow right on the beach. This was great during the day but I have to say we felt a little vulnerable at night. The hotel does employ security and there are police that patrol the beach, but because of the lack of phone in the room (and we had no cells) we felt a little concerned at not being able to alert anyone should the need arise. Maybe an assistance call button or something similar could be installed in rooms to put guests at ease. Secondly, as we do not usually stay at all inclusive resorts we were a little confused at how the account worked each night at dinner. I still don't really get why we had to sign a check each night even though our dinner was included. Maybe this was for tips? I think this matter, as well as which drinks were included, could have been clarified at check in. I know there were other guests who were also a bit confused about what was and wasn't inclhardly Thirdly, we were very disappointed on one afternoon when we went to go snorkeling to find the water sports center had closed for the day two hours early! We queried this with both reception and the concierge but neither was very helpful and we never got to snorkel. Despite these complaints we would definitely return to the mahekal. A couple of tips- don't get a massage At the hotel. There are beach massages just north of the mahekal for a fraction of the price\u00a0 Also don't pay to have your laundry done by the hotel, this is really expensive and there is heaps of places around playa that will do it really cheap. We went to a laundry right up the street and paid about $4 USD for 4 kilograms of laundry. A really great place for lunch was baremar right up the street on the corner of fifth avenue.

It was spot on! The beach was gorgeous (I never saw much past 1/2 mile north but the beach south didn't even compare). Our beach was wide and clean and uncrowded. The staff was ultra accommodating and pleasant, we especially bonded with Rojalio who really went out of his way to say hello to the boys and was never without a smile.

We caught some football (soccer) in the lounge area one night but in our rooms we read or slept, usually tired from a full day of sun and travel.

I was not impressed at all by the other hotels in the area, even ones that ranked higher than this one on TA rankings. The lobby is so charming upon arrival, with a great \"reading room\" where you can borrow books, leave books and flip through coffee table books. The resort is split into two sections with a public access walkway down the middle. This means there are ALOT of locals on the beach at all times, however, we did go when it was VERY hot weather so I imagine the locals were just trying to cool off. Our beachfront palapa was beautiful from the outside, literally a 10 second walk to the shoreline. Great patio with hammocks. Really something not most get to enjoy ever in life=) The inside was in need of major updates, the A/C was probably stuck at about 78 degrees so my husband was constantly hot and trying to cool down, and some of the curtains had big stains on them. The bathroom has literally almost no lighting when the sun went down. We were in 34 P. We were very happy with the food. Each morning with the half-board package we had, there was a huge buffet breakfast and then a menu you can order of off that features great Mexican breakfasts, omelettes and even pancakes. Lunch was also really great, we did this over dinner most days. There's a two-sided menu you can pick from with great Mexican dishes from tacos to ceviche to chicken sandwiches and burgers (the burger was actually pretty amazing!) Dinner was also great the two nights we did it. The daily happy hour was a steal, with most drinks just $5 and offered at 2-for-1. The staff was not memorable really at all. I will say that we had originally booked a room in the Garden View Pueblita area and we would have not been happy there. There are a lot of rooms, stacked into one area and all the balconies open right up to your neighbors. It was really kind of weird and like a huge communal tree house. The beaches were pretty beautiful and you could walk a decent distance both ways. There was some major seaweed at times, but that could just be due to currents. I will say this about Playa, it's very touristy and not quite as charming and quaint as I had imagined. Most of the restaurants along 5th Ave. were really expensive, which was kind of surprising considering the hotels in town are not that nice. There was though ALOT of great Italian. We asked our waiter at Origenes, which is a great restaurant across the street from the resort, for his favorite spots in town and they were some dive Italian spots that had $2 wine and great pizzas! I will also say this, we went in August and it was REALLY hot. And we were coming from Phoenix were it was 110-plus degrees.

They provide beach towels at the reception and everyday one has to exchange them with new ones.

The purpose of going to Mexico was purely to get away for some R&R and basically do nothing all day. I got what I wanted, and wish I could have stayed an extra day. This resort is a good value and I do recommend it. There are just a few quirks that prevent me from giving it five stars, but I would stay there again. The pros: -Beautiful decor. I really loved the atmosphere. It's very tasteful, and very Mexican. -The staff is terrific. They speak English and they seem to genuinely love customers and guests. They are great with giving directions and recommendations and attending to problems very promptly and with a smile. -I loved our room. We stayed in a garden view room, and the beach and pool were a short walk away. It was always spotless after a cleaning. The bed was comfortable, it had a fan and an AC unit, both of which really cooled things off. The bathroom was spacious. We had a spacious front porch with two wonderful hammocks. The hammocks are stored in the closet in the room, and they are very easy to assemble. -The beach is beautiful. The beach chairs and umbrellas are plentiful, we never had a problem finding a spot for two. The water was fantastic. -Pools. The resort has two pools, both of which have chairs and umbrellas aplenty. The water is great, and the pools are cleaned regularly. We enjoyed the pools and spent a lot of time there. -Bar. The bar was great. Happy hour is from 5 to 6 pm daily and it's a two for one. The drinks are really good. They aren't watered down at all, and the pina colada was one of the best I've ever had. -This resort is family friendly without antagonizing singles and couples. There were lots of children there, but also lots of couples with no kids. I have no kids and generally do not enjoy \"kid-friendly\" places. This place struck a perfect balance though. -Location. Terrific location, as 5th Ave, the main drag of Playa del Carmen, is a five minute walk away. Shopping, restaurants, even a Starbucks is within very easy reach. Cons: -The food options. I'm a total foodie, and when I visit Mexico, I want Mexican food. I researched a lot before booking this resort because I wanted one that would serve authentic regional fare. The website is a bit misleading. This resort is not all-inclusive, it's semi-inclusive, which means you get breakfast and either lunch or dinner included. But all alcohol and one meal a day is on you. The first night we ate dinner at the resort because the website indicated that dinner service included Mexican fare. It does not. Know that before you go if this kind of thing is important to you. However, their breakfast and lunch options do include Mexican food. So we were pretty happy eating breakfast and lunch at the resort and the venturing down to 5th Ave for dinner. -Quality of food. Definitely not the worst I've tasted, but also not the best. The breakfast items are hit and miss, although the lunch is pretty good. Not outstanding, but good. -Drinks are not included. I fully expected that alcohol would not be included but I was not expecting that things like cola or bottled water wouldn't be included. That seemed a bit cheap to me. Overall, I enjoyed staying here and would do so again.

I am so impressed at how they have maintained this place to be very low-key and not commercial or hoax-y at all. This place is everything that is described on their website. We felt as if it was even better than we could have imagined. We stayed in adorable little cabin type thing just steps away from the beach. We always found a beach chair easily. There were never any lines to wait on. We felt as if we had the place to ourselves, as it was hardly ever crowded on the beach or in the pools. It was just a very short walk into town. We felt completely safe, even as 3 women travelling alone. There are security guards on the beach and all throughout the town. Breakfast was included, and then you could choose to have either lunch or dinner there as part of the plan. We chose dinner most nights. The lunch was also excellent. Every cabin has its own front porch and 2 hammocks at least. This is a place for reading, swimming, and relaxing. The water was sooo warm that we swam in it much more than we expected. The grounds and beach are immaculately cleaned. Drinks are not included at dinner or during the day..keep that in mind. Dont worry about what you eat at the hotel or in any of the major restaurants in town. We didnt have any problems digestive-wise. Its possible to takes lots of trips from Playa del Carmen, but honestly what you'll want to do is park yourself on a beach chair, or in a hammock and lounge.

We needed a room in Playa del Carmen for 1 night on our way to Cozumel so I wanted a beach property that was reasonble. I reserved a beach view room which was 1 row back from the beachfront bungalows. If we'd had more than one morning to enjoy the beach I would have gladly paid the extra for a bungalow. These could be in a movie! Our spacious 2 bed room had a large private deck with a passable ocean view. It was neat & clean and on the 2nd floor. The property is spread out with bungalows and small 3 story buildings with maby 2 rooms per floor. I'm giving this a 4 star rating for the warm ambiance even though it has a slightly funky atmosphere because I prefer this for a tropical retreat over a more modern monolithic hotel wrapped around a huge pool! The room rate included breakfast & dinner but not alcoholic beverages. The room had AC but WiFi is only available in the reception palapa building. We arrived at the hotel right about the time dinner was over but the friendly staff made sure we got hustled over to catch the tail end of the buffet which was good despite being cleared away 10 minutes after we sat down. The only negative thing I can say about the hotel is that it is a $6 dollar, ten minute taxi ride to the central area of town for shopping, restaurants and night life.

We loved the beach there and gave the dive shop on their premises good business, as they had a couple of great guides and a lot of nice dive spots can be accessed right from that beach by boat. We experienced some down points though which I would like to share: - the management is very inflexible when it comes to ther half board arrangement. you cant book without it and have to have breakfast and and dinner or lunch in teir restaurant. while breakfast was okay (lots of fresh fruit and eggs served to your liking incl. mexican specalties) dinner and lunch werent so exciting. fresh salads and veggies where only very little available and the overall quality of the food was medium. we chose to have lunch and go out for dinner, as a few very good restaurants are nearby, - the only wireless available at that time (but for free!) was in the bar. my personal opinion is, that in todays world wirless should be available in all hotel rooms for free. - having worked in the service industry myself ive noticed that nobody at the reception ever asked how our stay was even though they several chances. - prices for coffee and beer seemed quite high to me. we re in mexico.... - bar and restaurant where not always whiped clean and left sticky for the next guest. - beach towels are supplied daily by the hotel which i consider a great service. but you have to swap them at the reception and sometimes have to wait a little as staff was busy. they should move this service down to the beach somewhere and not bother te front desk staff with this. As I dont really rate a hotel by how they fold their towels and even though there were nice arrangements on the bed every day it didnt get me excited. I'd rather have the management investing in some of the points above instead. I must say though that the restaurant staff was very friendly.

While the resort isn't perfect, it suited us great. The laid back style and location were exactly what we wanted. There are a lot of reviews that go into detail about the hotel, so I won't do that here, but below are a few things to know before going. The bad: - The front desk staff didn't seem to know what they were doing or at least the woman who checked us in didn't. It wasn't a good first impression. - The dinners weren't that good. We ate there three times and none of them would be considered good. Adequate or ok maybe, but not good. That said, you can trade your dinner (which is included) for lunch and eat out, so this isn't a huge deal. - Drinking water. They give you 1 liter of water a day per room. That wasn't enough for the two of us. While they will sell you more ( for normal US prices), I ended up walking up 38th street to the OXXO (two blocks away) and buying 5 liter jugs there for what the resort wanted for 1 liter. The good: - The staff, with the exception of the front desk people, were all great. They went out of their way to make our vacation great. Rogelio, Gabriel, and Juan deserve special mention. - Location, Location, Location. Mahekal is both right on a great beach and in walking distance to all of the action of 5th Avenue. It offers the best of both worlds. - The grounds are beautiful. The grounds staff work diligently to keep Mahekal clean and it shows. - Good breakfast and great lunch. Wonderful food and the view is priceless. The best part is that if you exchange dinner for lunch, both meals are included. - Happy hour! Buy one get one free. Some tips: - Take a little time and read the reviews here at Tripadvisor. It is amazing how many people seem to go and not know that there are no TVs or phones and then complain about it. - They have a few mini fridges that you can rent, so if you want one, ask. They give preference to people with medical conditions and those with kids, but we were able to get one. That was real nice. - If you are a light sleeper and want to sleep late, you may want to bring earplugs. The birds at Mahekal get up early and like to sing. We thought it was great, but others might not. - Don't let the idea walking to 5th ave. daunt you. The walk isn't bad (we always felt safe) and the bustle and excitement of 5th ave will serve as a nice balance to the laid-back style of Mahekal.

It is a town with so much charm and with people from so many different countries. tip: do not exchange all your dollars at the airport, they have such a low rate and you will get a lot more money if you wait to exchange them at Playa. There are several places where you can get pesos. Also you can get a bus (ADO) from the airport to Playa del Carmen. Then take a taxi to the hotel. It is around 20 dlls round trip.

The hotel grounds and the bungalows are very nice as previous reviewers have said. But there are swarms of mosquitoes!! It is close to impossible to sit outside in front of your bungalow in the evenings or mornings. You'll be eaten alive by mosquitoes! Some of them are even active during the day or make their way into the bungalows. This seriously ruined the fun of of staying there for us. What's the point of having a bungalow on the beach with a nice deck and a hammock if you have to lock yourself up inside armed with insect repellent? After getting 40+ bites (on one person!) on the first night we went to buy insect repellent first thing the next morning at a pharmacy a few blocks away (corner 38 and 30 av). That reduced the number of new bites we got each day but it remained a significant problem during our stay with a substantial number of bites every day and the inconvenience of repeated applications of the repellent. It would have been nice if the front desk would have told us about the mosquitoes when we checked in. We would have been able to use the repellent right from the start. Interestingly, I noticed that the front desk staff has a bottle of repellent that they are using frequently. Nice! We told the lady at the front desk about the mosquito problem we are having but she didn't care much. We asked if we could move to a bungalow that has more of a breeze but she said that these bungalows would be in a higher category which required an extra charge and she can't say if it helps anyway. When I asked if I could see an alternative bungalow she refused to hand me the keys and called the bell boy so he could accompany me. I got the keys after more discussion but I was shocked that apparently I was not trustworthy enough to get keys for 10 minutes to look at a room. That reflects the idea of customer service the front desk seems to have. In contrast to the front desk, the rest of the staff was very friendly and did go out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cExcatly how you would imagine paradise!\u201d", "Author": "finetraveler0", "ReviewID": "UR114099614", "Content": "My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at Mahekal Beach Resort, to celebrate our Birthdays.

This was our second trip to Playa del Carmen but the first to Mahekal. Our goal was to do nothing but relax, read and swim, and we met that goal 100% in this lovely resort. If you are into the all-inclusive swanky big resorts, then don't go to Mahekal! If you love a smaller more personal resort with plenty of peace and quiet (except for those darn Starlings) and TONS of character and ambiance, the go to Mahekal! The individual thatched roof cabana type rooms can't be beat for charm, and we stayed in a third floor (not for the faint of heart) penthouse (30P) which was so worth the climb to reach it (I am in pretty good shape for a 45 year old woman, but it was a butt and knee workout going up and down several times a day). The room was overly spacious and simply furnished and decorated. No electronics at all, which was a welcome detox from TV, phone and radio! A clock would have been welcomed, and I have mixed feelings about wi-fi. To get wi-fi, you must go to the lobby or the bar adjacent to the lobby. This was fine for us, as I only needed to check email daily. But there are times when the only way to get away is to continue to work some, and wi-fi in the rooms would be welcome in that case. The high pitched thatched roof was not only charming but kept the room cool. We didn't turn on the a/c at all during our 8 day stay (it was 90ish outside). Housekeeping did a wonderful job. Our only room complaints would be that it could use a chest-of-drawers and that the casement windows don't stay open too well in the ocean breeze and could use some support. Penthouse 30P is at the far south end of the resort, and it has plenty of privacy and a lovely ocean view obstructed only by some great palm trees. It was quiet and had a nice sized balcony for lounging in the shade (not late afternoon). The king size bed was very comfortable. Loved the tiled shower from which you could also see the ocean! If you need privacy in the toilet area, however, this won't work for you as it only has a swinging bar door. The staff was exceptionally friendly and any need was accommodated. All spoke some English and most were quite fluent. Rogelio among the wait staff is wonderful. All the wait staff were all wonderful, but Rogelio is particularly outgoing and friendly, and we enjoyed him very much. The beach is the best in Playa, but it is still a public beach (which we think makes it more interesting) with armed beach patrols and some degree of trash despite their daily efforts at raking it. The beach was fairly quiet without as much jet-ski and para-sailing traffic as we remembered from a prior visit to a nearby resort. This is probably due to the fact that the Mahekal attracts a more sedate, mature clientele than its neighbors down the beach where there is more activity, and to the fact that the water was pretty choppy most of the time we were there. There were always plenty of lounge chairs in the sun or shade, and the hammocks were heaven! A waiter came around a regular intervals to see if we needed anything. The beach was great! Playa del Carmen itself continues to become a more gaudy touristy town with residual charm. The \"newer\" developed North end toward Mahekal is nicer, and there are a few decent restaurants within an easy walk of the resort. The closest block of 5th Ave is Italian, and we loved the pizza at Amore. The Mahekal restaurant provides breakfast and either lunch or dinner. Since we didn't want to leave the beach during the day, we switched dinner for lunch all but our first night. The breakfast and lunch menus are adequate but limited, and the food was just \"ok.\" It would be nice if the resort would provide unlimited purified bottled water, but you only get one modest bottle per day. We walked out twice to a convenience store a few blocks away to buy cheap gallons of bottled water. You must pay for all drinks other than coffee with the meals, and it does seem that they could include a beverage! We would return to the Mahekal Beach Resort again and again, but we are finished with Playa del Carmen which has so little to offer in culture or natural beauty other than the beach.

The wedding party was annoying at the pool as there seemed to belong in Cancun (college kids, from Brooklyn, NY..ick!)

Xel-ha and Coba are great excursions and Boli (the concierge) is not only helpful but, honest. He listens to what you want.

We also made friends with a stray cat who was adorable and slept on our patio every night. If you run into this cat, don't be afraid she is a sweetie and the bodega on 5th sells cat food for 2 dollars. She'll chill with you when you nap in your hammock.

We chose it over all of the other resort in the ever expanding \"Riviera Maya\" because it embodies the spirit and beauty of the Yucatan and the Caribbean rather than re-creating just another mega resort that could be anywhere in the world. We chose it initially for the bungalow-on-the-beach experience, and fell in love with the people who work at Mahekal (many are the same two decades later). We love the low-key lifestyle we live at Mahekal, mostly barefoot, grabbing a beer or snack when we need one, breakfasting on authentic Mexican egg dishes like Huevos Motulenos, devouring fresh, simply grilled fish for lunch. New owners took over in 2008. We'd heard the place was getting torn down, and it broke our hearts. What we didn't know until the year was that the economic crash of recent years actually SAVED Mahekal from distinction. Funding and resources dried up, so the new owners re-invested in the resort instead, with wonderful results. The employees all stayed! When there were no guests at the resort, when the economy and swine flu and then trumped up reports of violence in Mexico scared tourists away, the employees never lost one day of work. They helped fix the place up instead, gardening, painting, whatever needed to be done. The guests are back now, and it is an even happier place than it used to be, because everyone knows what could have been lost. Visiting now is even sweeter than before. Some rooms have been remodeled in a more modern Mexican motif. I miss the old Mexican tiles, but I love the comfortable beds, the nice linens, the thoughtful touches like reading lights over the bed, extra storage capacity, rain showers, and beautiful artistic touches. The evening restaurant has stepped up its quality and the food is consistently great. The menu hasn't changed so much (lots of terrific regional fare mixed with just enough European/American dishes to satisfy those who need a little comfort from home while traveling) but the preparation, the flavors, the freshness, all much improved. We noticed extra security on hand, but never felt we needed it. Still, for some wary travelers, be assured: they've got your back.

The first was in 2007 for 5 nights, then 2010 for 7 nights, and this year for 10 nights. We have already started saving for our return next year and are hoping for 12-14 nights. What a truly relaxing, beautiful and friendly experience. The staff are wonderful, they remembered us from the previous years and went out of their way to welcome us and make us feel pampered and at ease. We especially enjoyed chatting with Rogelio, Jorge, Manuel and Jose. We learned that a 10% gratuity is included on the bill at dinner for drinks, but not for service of the food at breakfast or for the evening meal. You may want to tip your waiter directly to ensure that they are being compensated fairly for all the hospitality, hard work and service they provide. We experienced these tips being graciously and gratefully accepted. Improvements are noted throughout the property, from upgraded linens and bedding, to higher end toiletries, and the dinner meals were most enjoyable this time, as they included greater variety and more fresh vegetables and salads, than in previous years. They were so good we didn't bother to switch them for the lunches. Our children (boys 11 and 14 years) absolutely relished this experience and were quite happy with the simple pleasures at the resort, playing in the ocean for hours, playing pool and ping pong, hanging out in the hot tub at sundown and painting ceramics. What a treat for us to see them unplugged from electronics and truly appreciating their surroundings. In the bar/ activity palapa, Julianna manages the ceramics, with help from her sons, and all are very talented artists. Julianna and Jose custom painted stunning, large platters for me, which are now hanging beautifully in our home, eliciting many compliments. We have stayed twice in garden rooms and this time in an ocean view room, which was merely steps from the ocean. We found that the ocean breezes kept the room cooler and airy, without the need for air conditioning, despite the weather being 25 celsius at night. The rooms were kept very clean, with an ever changing array of towel art and flowers, and the maids and gardeners were also very friendly. The beach was perfect for an early morning run, an afternoon siesta, or a later in the day walk to town for fruit or ice cream from the vendors. And yes it is the best part of the beach for miles. A vendor sells fresh fruit in a cup for $2.00 right beside the public access to the beach, steps from the hotel's beach chairs. The fresh mangoes, coconut, watermelon and pineapple were fantastic. Boli, the concierge, recommended us to go to Plaza de las Americas mall, one day for mexican ice cream and we also bought a styrofoam cooler to keep our drinks cold in the room. We went on one full day tour from Edventure Tours and had a great time. The highlight was swimming in the open ocean with sea turtles. WOW!! All in all this is a fantastic place to spend a vacation. I searched the internet thoroughly, from the Caribean to all over Mexico, looking for an alternative vacation beach spot, but was unable to find another hotel with these qualities. We were thrilled to hear that the hotel was not going to close as was previously reported during our first trip and we urge the new owners to continue to retain the unique charm and character that is Mahekal. We will be back!!", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cbest place on earth\u201d", "Author": "alo24", "ReviewID": "UR104537622", "Content": "I cant say enough about Mahekal.

Everything was amazing with our room, the location of the room, the beach, the food, etc. Okay, I'll break down some of the components of our amazing trip. ROOM: was 52A, by the garden view, aka we watched the cute fountain from our room, and it was really relaxing to swing in the porch hammocks and watch the fountain and listen to the crazy jungle birds. The room was tidy, and the AC worked well. The bathroom was clean and had character with the funky colored tiles. Note: the shower is an open one, something to keep in mind if you are sharing a room with someone that you are not comfortable with them seeing you fully naked. There's a free safe in the room, and they give you complimentary bottles of water each day that you stay. Also, you may walk through sand to get to your room, but they mop the floors every morning, so the sand doesn't accumulate. Make sure to talk to the concierge \"Bali\", he is awesome and will give you the best referrals. We had wanted to snorkel, but the waves at Playa were too choppy and the port was closed. The 3rd party company who does the snorkel rentals, etc. referred us to Cozumel or Akumal. Basically we ended up renting a car for $45, rented snorkel equipment for $10 (all through the resort). With our 1 day rental car, we drove to Tulum to see the ruins and then went to Akumal to snorkel on our own, aka it was free. All of this was based on the recommendations of \u201cBali\u201d. It was the best idea ever honestly! RESORT: Everything is so close together, it's awesome. It literally was a 1.5 minute walk to the beach. We only had breakfast and dinners there, both of which were really good. The pools were nice and clean. The beach is clean and you get to hang out with the locals since it\u2019s a public beach. Happy hour is offered from 5-6pm and it\u2019s buy 1 get 1 free special. The prices are in pesos (make sure to bring more pesos than your form of currency, ie. USD or EUR, pretty much all the places were wanting pesos). Drinks at the hotel were honestly the cheapest ones I saw in comparison to places on 5th Ave.; they were between the 40-65 pesos range. Try the \u201cbeach kiss\u201d which is pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and Malibu blended with ice. It smells like Hawaiian Tropic, but tastes phenomenal! 5th AVE: Being 2 girls on a vacation in Mexico, there was never a time where we didn\u2019t feel safe. The 5th Ave area is super trendy and busy. Make sure to walk all the way down, there are so many cool things that you wouldn\u2019t expect to be there. Overall, I will be coming back to Mahekal pretty much for the rest of my life. It was so tranquil that it was hard to leave. I\u2019m secretly thinking about it for a destination wedding because it was an unforgettable experience. :-)", "Date": "April 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cTerrific, low-frills vacation\u201d", "Author": "Kelly5280", "ReviewID": "UR103048955", "Content": "We had a terrific time at Mahekal. All the reviews are right--the staff are fabulous. The food was fine, not great, but the atmosphere in the dining halls made it a special experience. We had entertainment on a few nights, and by mid week, we knew many our wait staff and fellow guests. Our kids had the run of the place--it's that safe--and made friends with other guests' kids. Nightly Happy Hour in the 'club house' was a treat--the kids met their new friends there for ping pong & pool & \"kiddie cocktails\" while we sat at the bar. Our rooms (we were in 36A & B: oceanview was more like a 'glimpse') were just OK. The beds were comfortable, but too close, and the bathroom was humid and smelly. 36A's AC was WAY too strong for the small room, so we had to turn it on and off all night long to keep the humidity down! We either froze or were hot and sticky. (36B was more comfortable.) We would have liked a room fridge, but bought a cooler & ice at the little tienda up the street to keep cold water bottles on hand. I'd have loved a broom, too! Since the whole resort is on sand, it's hard to keep it out of your room, especially with kids running in and out. One sweep per day by the housekeeper wasn't sufficient. I'd also have liked shades to block out the morning sun! The room was bright by 6am! The turquoise water was perfect--warm & shallow a long way out, though rough. The location is great--close to 5th avenue, but far enough away from the pushy vendors and mayhem. We would go back, but next time, we'll shell out the extra beans for oceanfront.

We looked at many different resorts, including some of the big, all-inclusive ones, which seem to me basically like land locked cruise ships. (Blech for me) We settled on Mahekal Beach Resort (formerly Shangri-La) after reading reviews on every single site we could find, and a very thorough google-image search of the resort. I am SO GLAD we came here. We only stayed for four nights, but it was HEAVEN. It is just far enough away from Playa Del Carmen that at night it is silent. Its about a ten miunte walk into the heart of 5th avenue. The resort is right on the beach, and is almost spotless. We stayed in the back in the garden view pueblitos - very secluded and very private, but also, comfortable. We absolutely loved it. It was small and perfect, felt clean (although I will admit sand does get everywhere) and felt like it was ours in a short span of time. The staff was so wonderful, very helpful and overall very happy. Everyone was pleasant and enjoyed a laugh with us whenever we wanted to chat. The food was, for us, just ok. I am vegan and my husband is vegetarian, and we are from NYC so we are accostomed to bold flavors. The food seemed a bit bland, but thatmay be just to keep the most amount of their clientele happy, as there did seem to be a number of people from smaller areas (though we did run into a few other New Yorkers) The beach was GORGEOUS. Previous reviews I read complaints about a fishy smell and lots of seaweed on the beach, but I'm not sure if these people have ever been near a large body of salt water, since that's kinda the deal. The staff worked hard to keep the beach free of seaweed, and most of the sand in the water in front of the resort is free of shells etc (there for easy on the bare feet) I honestly have no complaints whatsoever about this place - we will DEFINTELY be going back next year, and hopefully each year after that :) I do not think we would have been happy at one of the large crazy all inclusive resorts, our airport shuttle stopped at one on the way out and it was kind of horrible feeling.

However, if you do, the Mahekal's stretch of beach is one of the best I've ever been on..white sand and turquoise water that is so warm you can walk right in.

Although you feel like you're in your own little world, the Mahekal is not isolated... it's an easy walk to get into downtown Playa del Carmen. The Mahekal guests are varied and range from young couples, families with small children, families with bigger children, and older adult couples. This is not a spring break establishment. The guests also come from many countries, including Canada and Europe. I like the fact that it's not just Americans here. Despite all the bad news about Mexico, we felt totally safe in Playa and at the resort. We did see a policeman with a machine gun in downtown Playa; however, I was happy to have the police presence.

First the good: You are located right on the beach, the beach is nice, you get to chose either breakfast and lunch, or breakfast and dinner, the food is good to very good, the resort is close to downtown about a 10 minute walk for restaurants and shopping, the rooms are rustic but ok-we liked having our own \"hut\" with ocean view and hammocks are a nice feature, staff is very friendly and when they are motivated the service is good, the landscaping, grounds and physical appearance of the resort is nice, we loved having fresh seafood for lunch every day at the Aventura restaurant by the pool facing the ocean.

The New Year's Party was included as part of our meal plan. The food for New Year's was very good and the party was ok, though nothing special. The negatives: Transfers are not included, it ended up costing our group of 15 about $250 RT with a private transfer service, Google Playa del Carmen transfers, the hotel quoted us $900 RT. Drinks are not included in the meal plans and all of us love to drink on vacation! This means every water, coke, beer, pina colada, margarita, etc. Our extra bill was over $400 and we were one of the cheap ones! The rooms are rustic, there are no tv's, telephones or refrigerators in the rooms, this could be a positive for some people. The water pressure is poor and the bathrooms and rooms are in serious need of updating. There is really no live entertainment to speak of at the hotel, there is a bar with pool and ping pong tables and TV that was quite busy. The pools are too cold, so none of the adults really used these. There is a public walkway that runs right through the middle of the resort to the beach, meaning that during weekends and holidays locals fill up the beach right in front of the hotel. In addition, there is a sewage smell not too far to the North of the hotel that when the wind blows from the North, these factors definitely affect your beach experience. All in all, we had a nice vacation; however, for our next trip, we will probably look to stay somewhere else.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cEverything we were looking for\u201d", "Author": "NicoleElter", "ReviewID": "UR98436433", "Content": "Mahekal was everything we imagined and more. From the time we booked the trip to our cab ride to the Cancun Airport, they were more than willing to help with anything and everything. Concierge: Boli, the concierge, was THE BEST! He was so friendly and really went above and beyond. He made dinner reservations for us, organized a snorkel trip with others from the hotel and booked us horseback riding. He made everything so easy, we told him what we were looking for and he delivered! He offered up suggestions of things we might like to try and did everything with a smile. I have nothing but great things to say about his service. Hotel: The hotel is a hidden gem! The grounds and rooms are really unique. I was very happy to not be in a high rise building. It really allowed for a true \"beachy\" feel. The hotel was very casual, but beautiful which made it all the more relaxing. There was no pressure to have anything but your beach cover up on while at lunch or at Happy Hour. It was so nice to be able to walk off the beach at 5PM, sandy and in flip flops and head straight to Happy Hour! Food: Breakfasts were included and were great! Many options (yogurt, delicious fresh fruits, pastries, eggs, cold cuts, etc.). You had the choice of eating lunch or dinner at the hotel. We had lunch there every day. What I loved the most about their food was that it was simple and fresh. They had several healthy options, so that you didn't feel like you were gaining 10 pounds during your stay. It was the kind of food that you could every day and not get sick of. We had dinner at the hotel twice. Both nights were buffet. They were good, but not as good as the lunch. I think that is typical when you eat buffet style. Playa: Playa was a great place to walk around at night or during the day. They have so many great restaurants, it's really hard to choose from!! I ate at Fusion, El Tortuga and John Gray's. All awesome places that I would definetly recommend. Also, there is a great coffee place on 5th Avenue: Au Cacao. They had the best iced coffee I have ever tasted. ** I do have one suggestion though. Depending on the room you are planning to stay in, be sure to request an exact room or don't give up until you get what you want. My boyfriend and I paid for an Ocean Front room, which we thought would be our own private bungalow on the beach. It turned out that we were in more of an Ocean View Room, 27 Playa. It was not a private bungalow, it was connected to 4 other rooms. 2 next door and 2 above. We were very, very upset when we saw this (even though it was directly on the beach). They said they get complaints a lot about that room, and the old management did have it listed as an Ocean View Room. There were several other people who were upset with their room location (almost every person we saw checking in had an issue). I think they may have been overwhelmed, as the hotel was fully booked. We never ended up being able to move rooms and they would not refund us for the Ocean Front, but we got over it once we stopped and realized how little time we actually sat in our room. All in all, the best!!!!", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cBeach Getaway\u201d", "Author": "aw123", "ReviewID": "UR97872050", "Content": "We had a wonderful stay at Mahekal. The resort was beautiful and relaxing. We spent all day laying on the beach under the palapas. We felt that the resort was well represented on their webpage / in the photos here on Tripadvisor. It really was what we had been promised - a beach getaway without phones, televisions and blaring music. Property and staff: The resort is well maintained, they have a big crew and they are constantly sweeping the paths, raking the sand, etc. There were security guards on the beach, making sure that the loungers were always available for guests. (take your hotel towel with you when you go to the beach so they know you belong to the resort!) We had a cheap room in the back and were very pleased - it was spartan, yes, but clean and romantic with a big porch w/ hammocks and plantation blinds and screens on the windows instead of glass. Food: Breakfast was as others have said, awesome. Lots of selection, fresh fruit, fresh fruit juice, coffee, tea, yogurt, granola and cereal, breads, and a menu of hot items. Lunch was menu in the same building as the breakfast. They also have outside seating at the pool, overlooking the beach. There were three vegetarian items on the menu - Veggie Fajitas, Veggie Tacos, and Veggie Flautas. Basically mixed, cooked vegetables, with different breads/sides. I had the fajitas and flautas, both were good, and the vegetables were lightly seasoned so they had a nice flavor of their own. Dinner was sometimes menu and sometimes buffet. We alternated eating lunch and dinner at the hotel. Both the times the dinner was a menu, there was a vegetarian entree (cheese ravioli, and veggie stirfry), on the day there was a buffet, it was seafood themed, so I was left eating sides. There were a lot of sides however, and I didn't go hungry. All beverages (including water) are extra at dinner. Drinks: Happy hour is 2 for 1 from 5-6pm. Big turnout for this, and they did also have a selection of fancy non-alcoholic drinks that some people were ordering for their kids. Pina coladas were good with fresh pineapple juice. The prices I remember are: Corona 35pesos, Pina Colada 55pesos, Margarita 55pesos, flavored margaritas 65pesos. Most of the mixed drinks were between 50-65, and the beers were all 35 (I think?). So the 2x1 made it a pretty good price! Guests: Mix of people - young couples, families, and older couples. There were quite a few well behaved children around. Some Americans, Canadians, and a mix of Europeans - German, Italian, and French. Playa: Cute, touristy town. Lots of restaurants. The trinket shops were pretty crap, didn't find any really good crafty things to buy. The Mega is only a short walk away and you can get sunscreen, water, snacks, etc. much cheaper there. Sales people weren't too pushy and never touched you or shoved things in your hands. Also there weren't any people begging, or selling things on the beach, which was nice. Other Comments: 1. Bring bug spray! It is a tropical climate and there are a lot of bugs in the evening. 2. Carboncitos was a nice restaurant - had the vegetarian tacos w/ cheese, very good! 3. We used the ATM at the cancun airport in Terminal 3, just outside the bathrooms when entering Cancun to get pesos for the trip. When we got home the card was frozen, it had been compromised by someone trying to take money out elsewhere in MX : ( It was not a pleasant surprise after such a nice trip.

Wonderful hotel and great beach. The hotel is just as great as the reviews on Tripadvisor says, and I would love to come back some time. Tips: Rent a fridge in the reception - 5 US dollars pr. day Borrow a hair dryer for free in reception (or bring your own, it's pretty basic) If you need to leave early in the morning before breakfast is ready (7.30), ask reception to prepare something for you. They are happy to do this. you will get a ham and cheese sandwich, a banana, a small youghurt and chocolate milk. Take a taxi to Mega and get everything you need from groceries, to toiletries, batteries, water, etc. Mega is much better than wallmarts which is right next door. The taxi is 34 pesos. Walking would probably take more than 30 minutes and you might not like the look of some of the streets. The hotel recommends that you take a taxi when you go to Quinta Avenida (5th Avenue, the main strip in Play). this is not necessary, just go left when you exit the hotel and Quinta is the first street you meet. The further down you get, the more happens. Lots of bars, restaurants and souvenir shops. The hotel is located on Calle 38. There are a few nice restaurants and a good hammock shop on this street near the hotel. Quite charming area, actually. very unlike Quinta. There is a mini supermarket (quite dirty and not very nice) on the corner of Calle 38 and Quinta. If you continue down Calle 38 to the next corner you will get to Oxxo. this is also a mini supermarket and much nicer. Some kind of chain. it has an ATM inside. Nice to know: the beach is beautiful and the water wonderfull. however, be aware that it is a very very busy beach (in february). There is plenty of space and loungers on the hotel section of the beach but in front of this is the public section. here you will see large mexican families, large groups of young people hanging out and having fun, and many many tourists from nearby hotels without beach. There is also massive water sports actions - jetskies, parasailing, banana boats, fishing boats, speed boats, etc. Not very tranquil. Finally, there is a constant stream up and down the beach of joggers, walkers, etc taking pictures and videofilming. It did not ruin my experience, just don't expect to feel alone/private. there is also a beach club south of Mahekal. if the wind is in the wrong direction, you can hear the techno music. Choice of accommodation: We opted for the Seaview rooms and that was perfect for us. The rooms directly on the beach have the best views of course and is only a few meters from the edge of the water. but they also have no privacy. So be prepared to be filmed and ogled while sitting there. The wind is also very strong and cooling. Nice when you are in the sun but too cold for me when you are in the shade. We had a nice view but also shelter from the wind - number 31B. The downside was the proximity to the pool area and the bar. I would not recommend getting a ground floor room - again because you have no privacy. The first floor rooms feels very private. Well, I coud go on and on and really I can only give my warmest recommendation. If you have any questions, just write and I will help if I can.

Rooms are thoroughly cleaned each day, but we did have some ants each day. I guess that's a trade off for being steps from the ocean. By far the service award goes to Jose the Bellhop. He was genuinely friendly and had a smile we won't soon forget. Location to 5th ave. was perfect. Far enough to get away from the crowds, but within walking distance. Security was outstanding.

The Mahekal theme is primitive, no tv's, no phone, no clock, etc. That is all fine on paper but in our opinion for a hotel that lacks those things should be less expensive. They market their higher price being due to the included food. But unless you really enjoy buffets and very similar food for every meal you will want to wonder off resort to mix it up. Only other interesting things was the beach blanket situation. They make you initial next to your name when you check in, but they do not elaborate on why you are doing so. But if you leave your beach blanket on the beach they inform you that there is a $50 USD charge to get another one. I guess beach blankets are very rare in Playa Del Carmen. Overal we liked it, locals very nice, felt safe in town and didn't have any problems with the water. On a positive note the beach was great, although a bit more attention could have been paid cleaning up the garage on the beach, perhaps this is because it was a public beach, but we didn't run into as much trash on the beach at the Le Meridien.

We're in our mid to late-20's and were looking for a cheaper place on the beach in Playa.

Mahekal is a great place if you're looking for a great hotel that emphasizes the beauty of where you are. The hotel is made up of individual bungalow style rooms that have only what you need: a bed, a desk, and a bathroom. Thatched roofs and porches with hammocks complete the perfect setting for a beach getaway. The private beach has tons of chairs and palapas and you get fresh towels every day. The staff is beyond friendly and helpful. (Ignacio) Boli was friendly and hooked us up with a great private snorkeling tour and a tour of Chichen Itza. Nyx provided great restaurant suggestions, and the rest of the housekeeping, bartenders, and everybody else were always happy to see you. The location is about a 5-10 minute walk to 5th Ave, the main drag of Playa. The walk is well lit and we never felt unsafe. Even closer is a small bodega with cheap water/beer so you can fill up. Playa has so much to do and so much to see that we could have used another two weeks there! Free wi-fi in the lobby and bar area, free bottle of water in the AM, and 2x1 happy hour from 5-6pm every night completed the perfect vacation. The only thing we wished the hotel had was a small fridge in the room to keep extra food/water/beer. They are in the process of remodeling every room and the restaurants in the hotel, so there is a bit of construction, but it really wasn't a problem. The rooms could use a bit of updating, as our bathroom looked a little worn (e.g. the mirror was a bit rusted and the bathroom looked like it could have used a refreshing touch up). However, I think it's clear that our room hadn't yet been updated. There wasn't much sound insulation in our room, so expect to be woken up (if you're a light sleeper) to the sounds of tropical birds early in the morning, but by that point you should be out on the beach or exploring anyway! A word of warning - if you're looking for a fancy hotel with internet, tvs, and other amenities, don't come here. BUT, if you're looking for a beautiful hotel in the best setting (when we were picked up for our tour of Chichen Itza, all the other guests commented on how nice our hotel was - they were definitely jealous!) in Playa del Carmen, book a room immediately and stay for as long as possible!

Had a \"beach view\" room on the 2nd floor. It was great!. Good beach view and could here the ocean all night long. The staff were excellent everywhere at the resort. Restaurant overlooks pool and ocean, great view. Good breakfast which included fruit, juice, rolls, hasbrowns and sausage. They cook to order eggs, omletes, french toast and a variety of Mexican egg dishes. Only ate dinner once at the resort which was ok. Like the last reviewer didn't really like the coffee to much, not out of the ordinary outside the US. The rooms are sparse but clean, no TV or couch in the room, which I knew before I went. There was a hairdryer and safe.There was also AC. The bed was comfortable to me, firm matress and soft pillows, had a deck with chairs and hamocks. I stay in hotels at least 100 days per year and this was exacty what I was looking for. Not an all inclusive or regular type hotel room. The location to me could not have been better. We walked the entire beach and I thought this resort had the best location look and overall feel. North end of town. The beach is not as crowded and yet only a few blocks from 5th ave and a ton of restaurants etc, could not have been better. The bar has 2 for 1 drinks 5-6pm. If you are looking for the lap of luxary type room it may not be for you. But for us it was exactly what we wanted! We ate at around 6 restaurants in the area, hit and miss. My favorite was the Argentinian restaurant at the corner of 32nd and 5th Ave.", "Date": "January 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cgreat beach front\u201d", "Author": "drchrisf", "ReviewID": "UR92807089", "Content": "this place has no frills.

They include breakfast and a choice of lunch or dinner. I would choose lunch because it is better. Go out at night to some of the great local restaurants. My family has been to this hotel over the Christmas break 3 years in a row. The Cyan ha dive shop is on site and very good. The water temp is 78 degrees . The diving off of Playa is as good as Cozumel. A dive in a cenote is well worth it. The hotel is on the northern part of Playa away from fishing boats and crowds.

We were supposed to have an ocean view room, which was a bit deceiving as we were infront of the ocean but in a bit of a sandpit that really didn't allow for any ocean view. We asked to be switched to another room, which none were available, so we asked again the next day and my husband was taken to 4 different available rooms later in the day and was allowed to choose the one he wanted. This in my opinion was over and above what we were expecting and we were happy with our choices. The rooms are very basic. No TV, no phone, no wireless access ( it is available in the lobby at no charge), we didnt miss any of this at all as the sound of the ocean was lovely. Beds were ok and AC worked great. We had a bit of a problem with those little sand ants or whatever they are, in our bathroom and coming in under the front door. They managed to get into our suit cases too, so dont leave suitcases on the floor. Maid service was GREAT! They made cute animals out of the towels for our kids and placed their teddy bears next to them to the delight of our kids. AWESOME. However, most inconvenient was that there was no mini fridge, cooler or ice machine in or around the room. With 2 small children in such a hot environment, they need water alot as they tend to get burned, dehydrated and get sun stroke very easily. Water at the resort was VERY expensive as was ice. Even if you do buy ice, which we did once, there is no where to keep it! So my husband went up the road to a convenience store and brought back ice and a styrofoam cooler. That was OK, but the ice didnt last long in there either. Really if you want to keep a few cold beverages in your room you are kind of hooped. And going up to the store to keep buying ice was insane. That being said, the breakfasts at the resort were awesome. Great selection, great service, again paying for water. Dinner was also included in our stay but I admit we only ate there a few times.We found the dinner menu to not have much that was appealing to our kids, but they did have the salad bar. It wasn't that great for us either . We found it VERY difficult to find any authentic mexican food, not even any tacos or fresh salsa anywhere to be found, which was pretty disappointing. Overall I would definitely stay at this resort again. It is beautiful and quiet. We were happy to return to our cabana after visiting friends a a big resort down the beach that had music blaring day and night. However, a decent cooler/mini fridge and access to an ice machine is a must unless you like to drink warm beers, warm water and prefer your rum and cokes warm with no ice.

For people coming to this hotel with infants you must be aware there is no way to heat water in the hotel room and the hotel bar cannot always do it. i would recommend buying a device to heat water if you have a small child. The staff continues to be friendly and welcoming as in our previous visit. The hotel allows you to change your dinner to a lunch if you notify them by 1230pm. One of the few issues with the hotel is the lunch service. It is very slow. Expect lunch to arrive on average 50 minutes after you order it during the high season. These were the only issues that came up. Rooms are clean. We had ocean view rooms which we were happy with. 22B upstairs and 22A downstairs.

I usually hate to go back to the same place twice, but after 6 days at Christmas, I was glad I did. There are a few things that make this resort unique among the many in the area. First, it has a fantastic location, as you can walk easily from the hotel to many good restaurants, shops, beach clubs, water sports and (it sounds like a negative, but I was happy to have it - Starbucks!). Yet, the resort still feels small, removed, and in touch with nature. It's great to be able to leave for an hour or two to get lunch/dinner, shop or just explore without needing to make complicated arrangements or drive to an \"attraction\". We chose to explore our restaurants at lunch (Cuerva de Chango, Origines, and a beach club to teh north that had great food), but the town has a lot of night life as well. Second, the rooms are about the closest you can get to the beach anywhere except in Tulum. We had an oceanfront room - Playa - and I could see the water break on shore from my bed, and sitting on the porch was as good as being on the beach. Third, although very simple, the resort seems to attract a relatively sophisticated crowd (we heard all kinds of languages!) many of whom are repeat clients who vist every year. There was a nice mix of couples, families and and other groupings. As described, the rooms are very plain with no TV, radio or clock, and visitors seem to like it this way! We saw families chatting, playing games, reading etc and all seemed very content. I might suggest a laptop with a few movies to avoid technology withdrawal, though! Fourth, since the resort is \"in town\", there is a chance to interact with locals of all types, and watch a facinating parade of people up and down the beach. I do miss a few of the luxuries, but the atmosphere (and relatively good price) probably would not be the same if they were added. Jorge and Rogelio took great care of us at each meal, and were patient and cheerful with our requests and attemts at conversation in Spanish!

Accommodation included breakfast and either a lunch or dinner which worked out well as it gave us a great chance to experience and adventure out into 5th Avenue and (highly recommend Piola just up the road). All the meals we had at Mahekal were substantial portions and in the evenings of the nights we had dinner the service was professional. The lunch menu has a great variety which is great for kids.

I can not find enough words to praise the staff and management of this small piece of heaven! We left Chicago on a snowy morning, and arrived at the Cancun airport to 80 degrees and sun. The driver from Mahekal was there to meet us, even though the plane had been delayed for over an hour. After a 35 minute drive to the resort, we found our reservation was in perfect order and our beachfront bungalow was ready for us. I took some deep breaths of the sea air, felt the sand between my toes, and our short vacation began with some unwinding at Happy Hour at the Casa Club. Vicente, the bartender, knew our names when we gave our numero de habitation. Dinner that night at La Loma Restaurant, with great variety in the included meal plan, plus other options, was delicious. And that was the way things went for the next 4 days. The staff made it their job to know everyone by name, to remember what they like, and to be so friendly and accommodating that I felt like I was among good friends. Breakfast at the Aventura Restaurant is a wonderful spread of fresh fruit, deli meat and cheese, juices, hot and cold cereals, yogurt, granola, pastries, plus eggs cooked to order, pancakes or French toast, and lots of coffee! Can you tell I love to eat? I would call the cuisine at Mahekal Beach Resort \u201cmetro-Mexican,\u201d a delightfully tasty mix of Mexican and Mayan flavors, plus much, much more, to satisfy most palates. It certainly satisfied mine! The resort is set up like a village of cabanas, connected with sidewalks but surrounded by pristine white sand. The landscaping is lush and colorful, giving the property a woodsy feel, and is meticulously maintained. I felt relaxed just walking around the various property locations, because of the natural beauty, and the pathways are well-lighted at night for security. Our cabana was much more than we expected. Spacious, with very comfortable beds, an enormous tub and a great shower, toiletries and a hair dryer, lots of bath towels and beach towels, air conditioning and a ceiling fan, and hammocks on the front porch. And housekeeping was just excellent. Our front door was 25 yards from the water\u2019s edge. Each cabana has the added amenity of an outdoor rinse faucet next to the porch, so you can avoid tracking sand in with you. What a great touch! Then there is the beautiful, beautiful beach, with great swimming, sunning, people-watching, walking or running, and a dive shop right on the beach, with equipment for snorkeling and scuba. Just feeling the sun in December is so incredibly therapeutic to us northerners. Yes, I used lots of sunscreen. Mahekal is kid-friendly, with 2 beautiful pools in addition to the beach. The Casa Club has ping-pong and billiards, tv and a computer for client usage, and is a wireless hot spot. Mahekal is located just a few blocks from Playa del Carmen\u2019s 5th Avenue, and about 3 blocks north of the main tourist district with its fun shopping and restaurants. And of course, there are many off-site activities for families, and a little internet research in advance can get you discounted tickets to the local theme parks. We enjoyed a day at Xcaret. But for me, the relaxation of the feel of the sand and the sound of the surf was the best, and the pampering of the wonderful staff of Mahekal was as warm as the sun. Thank you to Elizabeth for her attention, to Rogelio for bringing out the sun, to Vicente for his masterful margaritas, to Manuel and Ivan and all the others whose names I am sorry to have forgotten. I hope to bring my 2 daughters back for their college graduation presents in a couple of year, and start a second generation of love for Mexico and for this location.

A very mixed group of people which was fine for all. Not many children because this resort is more geared for adults to unwind.

There are a variety of rooms to choose from, ocean front, penthouse, ocean view and garden view. The rooms are spacious with ceiling fans and air conditioners...each bathroom designed with unique colorful Mexican tiles. Each palapa style building has 2 guest accomodations-upstairs or down.

It is well worth it to choose this option. Breakfast is served in Adventura restaurant each morning with a buffet style array of fresh fruits, juices, cereals, yogurt, oatmeal, cereals, breakfast danishes and of course coffee. In addition you can order an omlette, french toast or other items from the breakfast menu...all part of the MAP plan. You can choose to eat lunch or dinner as part of the plan...swapping them out if you so choose. Each day's menu is posted at the reception area so you can make an informed decision. Drinks (alcohol or otherwise) are NOT included in the MAP plan. Dinner is also served buffet style most nights and the menu is varied with something for everyone. There is usually fresh fish, poultry, pork and plenty of veggies to choose from. If you prefer to swap lunch for dinner, a typical lunch menu is provided with everything from tacos and hamburgers to club sandwiches and pasta. I was always able to find something that I liked each day from the dinner or lunch offerings. Mahekal also has happy hour each day at the Tiki Bar complete with billiard and ping pong tables and swings where you can sit and sip your favorite cool drink. The beach is gorgeous at Mahekal.

Something that is not advertised at the resort is that you can rent ($5 per day) a dorm style refrigerator during your stay which I found most helpful! There is a small mini super store at the end of the street where you can find snacks, juices, sodas and most anything you might need. Of course Mahekal has a gift shop with various sundries the resort offers drinks as well at the bar or as you lounge on the beach. A short walk down the beach or street is the famous 5th Avenue with hundreds of shops and restaurants to suit any style or budget. A must visit! You will love all that Avenue 5 has to offer!

So, I feel that I knew what to expect when I got to this resort. If you expecting a luxury hotel room with all the amenities, you won't find it here. The rooms are very basic with a bed and desk. There is a full bathroom and central air conditioning. However, the windows open with wooden blinds and they are not sound proof in anyway. You get to listen to all the birds and wildlife as you wake up in the morning! We did find a few critters in our room but again this is a thatched roof room with screened windows. It heavy rains the thatch roofs do leak a little. We loved every minute of it as it was very peaceful and quiet. It was probably the most relaxed that I have been ever! We ate breakfast and lunch every day at the resort. The breakfast was ok. I have been to many other all inclusive resorts that had much better assortment at breakfast. As for the lunch, we found them to be wonderful! We walked to 5th Ave every night and at dinner there. Our dinners ranged from $25 to $120 depending upon where we ate. I would highly recommend Casa Mediterraneana. We spent about 60-70 for dinner at Casa (that is 2 dinners, 2 glasses of wine, 2 bottles of beer and dessert). From talking with other people at the resort, I understand that we did not miss anything with the dinners. Happy hour is every night at 5-6pm. The beers are $3.50 and the mixed drinks range from $4.50 and above. They do have wine there but i did not try it at the resort. Helpful Hints: 1. You can rent a refrigerator from the front desk for $5 a day (remember the rooms are very basic and do not come w/ a frig) 2. You can rent bikes to go into town for $4 an hour or $10 a day (don't quote me on these prices because we chose to walk) 3. You can rent boogie boards for the water for $4 an hour or $10 a day ( we did this and it was a blast). 4. Taxis - they cost about $3-5 to go into Playa del carmen. 5. To walk into Playa del Carmen - takes about 15 mintues to get into the \"heart\" of things 6. They have snorkel tours that leave from the beach in front of the resort for $25 per person - you leave at 1pm and get back at 3pm. Price includes snorkel equipment. Overall, I would go back to the Mahekal in a heartbeat! It is quit different than an all inclusive to be sure what you really want when you book this vacation.

This hotel is just average in our opinion, not sure where are the rave reviews are coming from. It was like an slightly upscale motel room, really, at $300/night for 'oceanview', which it did not have. Beach chairs not that comfortable (itchy fabric), drinks ok, but nothing like the great margaritas we had all week in Tulum at La Luna, and it was hot on the beach, too, in comparison to Tulum which is known for it's breezes which made being there in August totally do-able. I will say that the staff was friendly and accomodating. We decided when planning our trip to spend one night in Playa so our young adult daughters could 'play' a bit--but the town, to us, is way too tacky, honky-tonkish--not our style. And, compared to the beauty of Tulum, Playa (and the beach area in and around the town where this hotel sits) cannot compete. We did find in walking towards 5th Ave. area from hotel (not on beach, on streets) that this part of town seems to be going through an upscale-like renovation. We found a newly-opened wine bar called \"Cava\" just up the street from Mahekal that was great. Also, there was a cute coffee bar/lunch spot just 2 doors up from Cava that we had a nice breakfast at.

I had high expectations after reading the reviews here and other places and the resort and its staff did not disappoint. We arrived very early and our room wasn't yet ready. No problem. The staff invited us to change into our bathing suits and enjoy the property until the room was ready for us. They even greeted us with cool towels and water and took our bags so we could head to the beach. The beach at Mahekal is one of the best in Playa. It's wide, white sand is beautiful and the water is perfect for swimming because there is no rough reefs. There were always plenty of lounge chairs on the beach and we could always find a spot under the palapas. I personally preferred the caribe side. Yes, there is public beach access right at Mahekal, but it was no big deal. The beach never seemed crowded and the water was always way less crowded than areas south. We stayed in the pueblito garden section and our room was less then a two minute walk to the beach. It was quiet and tranquil there. We loved it. The only reason I would spend more money to upgrade our room was to take advantage of the ocean breeze. Back in the garden section all the lush tropical landscaping sorta steal the breeze :) Other than that our room looked the same as a beachfront unit i peeked into. In fact, I thought ours was nicer with a nicer headboard and more closet space. The rooms are basic but nice and comfortable. Our air conditioning was very cold and the ceiling fan made it feel down right frigid if we wanted it, so no problems there. It was always cleaned perfectly each day. The shower was open and big. Our room was very close to LaLoma where you eat dinner. Meals at Mehekal were excellent. Try the white fish...sooo good. In fact, try it all. We loved it, especially Mexican Fiesta night. The waiters are all really nice. Our favorites were Ivan and Juan. Brekfast was amazing with fresh fruit, cereals, pastries and made to order eggs, frensh toasts or pancakes. Mahekal even has a great lunch menu and u can eat right on the beach. So excellent. Drinks are cheap and happy hour features a 2 for 1 special...can't beat that. The resort is set up like a little mayan village with rooms in individual bungalows or two-story casitas. They all have their own porches with hammocks and little tables. I loved swinging on the hammock. One night I could hear music playing. It was so nice. Also this resort is close to the downtown, shopping area with restaraunts, stores, clubs, etc. You can walk or take a cab. It's also just a short cab ride to the collectivo stand that can take you to tulum, akumal, hidden worlds and several cenotes and other activities. The collectivo is way less expensive than a cab to these places and so easy to use. You can get to tulum and back for $6 a person instead of a $90 cab ride!! Anyway, back to Mahekal, the staff and the surrounding make this place so speacial. It's not like a big, impersonal super-all inclusive. The staff knows you and is very friendly and helpful. The vibe of ths hotel is very laid-back and really hosts a great mix of people from young couples and families. We met guests from around the world there. Everyone kinda of is just there doing there thing, enjoying the sights and sounds of the Caribbean. We loved it and highly recommend staying there. Thank you Mahekal for an amazing trip.

As such, I read and studied and reviewed others' input about Mahekal before booking it. Two friends joined us. They have many overseas experiences and affirmed the Mahekal decision was a good one. Where to start? 1. Service: The service by the wait staff was unmatched by anything in my 44 years of living. The wait staff consisted of local men who worked to calm every fear, service any need, and address any concern. The language barrier of English-Spanish was cheerfully met with patience and calmness to educate each other. My family befriended Rogelio and Ignacio (wait staff) throughout our stay. They were part of a class act at Mahekal. I have no bad reviews or negative comments to offer readers of this review. All of the folks at Mahekal were top notch but the wait staff were the ones with whom you interacted the most. 2. Rooms: The rooms give you a sense of ownership. They are simple cabana types structures with three important features: a comfortable bed, a cold air conditioner, and a shower. We expected a traditional room (like any chain hotel/motel) but that's not what Mahekal is about. If you find yourself wanting to stay in the room, you ain't living the experience. The room was secondary to the beach. We resorted to our rooms to sleep, get cleaned up quickly and head back out. For that the rooms were great. There are no TV's, no radios, no phones, no nada! You don't need, or want, all of that when you are there. The rooms are a place to sleep and get cleaned up. 3. Beach and Ocean: Awesome, incredible, missing it all ready, clean, seductive, and every other good word that goes with the beach experience. There are plenty of beach lounge chairs under palm trees. The salty air gives the edge you need to stay cool and comfortable. The people are beautiful, the sand is white, the water is blue, and the swimming is relaxing. 4. Security: There are several men dressed in professional uniforms who oversee the security of vacationers. I wasn't sure who they were at first, but I learned they are your version of community protectors. They watch over the beaches being mindful of your presence and needs while staying alert for any problems that may come to the beach and resort. Their presence is subdued by their ability to blend into the background, but it is appreciated because they truly watch out for the vacationers. No complaints from me about them. 5. Food at Mahekal: All inclusive? No! I made the decision to not go all inclusive when I weighed the cost and benefit. At Mahekal, you get two meals as part of your experience. Breakfast was awesome. They offer so much--it was great! The second meal could be either lunch or supper. We chose to make our second meal supper because the day was consumed with beach sitting or fulfilling other plans in Playa. The dining facilities are beautiful, well-kept, soothing, quiet with live music, and simply unparalleled in my experiences. You won't be disappointed. What does \"Mahekal\" mean? In our last day, we asked. The word \"magical\" is phonetically pronounced \"mahekal\" so the resort owners creatively named the resort \"Mahekal\" to match the phonetic sound while giving it a Mayan-name appearance. The experience matched the name--it was a magical visit. We will be going back for more.

This was our first time to the Yucatan Peninsula. We used this trip as our last hoorah before our 2nd child is born.... so it was mostly just a relaxing time and we didn't go there planning on doing much of anything. A few things that you should know: There is no wifi in the rooms. If you want to connect ot the Internet you should go to the lobby or the swing bar. Breakfast and Dinner is included. If you want to switch your dinner to lunch, go to the main desk and ask to switch before 12:00. You can always eat lunch in the restaurant anyway, and just charge it to your room. Try the shrimp fajitas! You can also order lunch/drinks on the beach.. they have a waiter out there who will take your order. We took the ADO bus from the Cancun airport and a cab from the bus stop to the resort. Total was about $30. If you take a cab from the airport it's $90 and a shuttle will be $60. We arranged a cab through the hotel to get us back to the airport. We just went the day before and told them we wanted a cab to take us back to the airport. It was $45. The swimming pool near the breakfast area tends to be cooler because of the ocean breeze. We liked both pools, but during the hottest hours definitely use the pool with the ocean view. There are plenty of lounges with Palapas. You don't need to get there early to 'save one'. We didn't spring for an ocean view room, and didn't feel like we were missing out. It was about a 3 minute walk to the beach, and at 6 months pregnant, it was fine. It's about a 10 minute walk to 5th Ave. It's a long walk when it's really hot.. but when it cools down at night, it's not a problem. We took a cab to Walmart to get big jugs of water for the week.

There were only a few minor flaws, but the overall charm of the resort more than make up for them. If you don't mind going without phone and TV, this is the place to be. I am a TV-Facebook addict and I did just fine without them for a week. Instead, I read a ton of books and just enjoyed the sounds of the ocean. You will never have a more beautiful view from your room. ROOM: We stayed in Casita 31P, which is a little more expensive than the other beachfront bungalows, but very much worth it for the location. We were directly on the beach. Walk off the cute deck (complete with hammocks and a table and chairs) and you are on the beach. The ocean is just yards away. You could not ask for a better view. Any closer and you'd be afraid a shark might eat you in your sleep. The bungalow was really neat. It has a super high thatched roof and is decorated with beautiful handpainted tiles throughout. The a/c works OK, but there are two fans which help out a bit. The bathroom is pretty, but not fancy. The sheets are scratchy. Other than that, it's perfect. BEACH: We had no trouble finding a palapa on the beach except our first day there when there was a wedding right in front of our bungalow. The locals come down on the beach, which would be fine, except they tend to sprawl out directly in front of the beach chairs and block the view. Luckily, they are only around on the weekend. The beach had a sulphur-ish smell certain days and if you walked a ways down the beach past the resort to the left, the smell was so bad it is vomit-inducing. Thankfully, it is only mild at the resort and occasional. The ocean was very warm, but it was not crystal clear like you'd see in Aruba. POOLS: The pools are nice when there are no kids in them. FOOD: Breakfast is like a buffet from your dreams. Fantastic. You have your choice of lunch or dinner. Lunch was a la carte and good. Dinner was good, although people seem to complain about it on here. I am a vegetarian and I always had something to eat on the dinner buffets. A few more options for vegetarians certainly wouldn't hurt. There was a cat that wandered around and begs off of you. She only likes meat. Give her bread and she'll turn her nose up at you! BAR: Drinks are good and cheap. Really cheap. Yeah! CHECK-IN: We got there after a long day of travel and were told our room wasn't ready, which ticked us off because it was after 3 p.m. check in and we had the most expensive bungalow. Plus, we were really tired. Someone checked out late so we didn't get into our room until after 4 which stunk. CELL PHONES: My husband's phone got no reception, but mine did. Make sure you authorize international calling before you leave though because I could receive calls but couldn't place them. LIZARDS: You see a few here and there but not as many as Aruba. DOWNTOWN: It is just a short walk. Like 5 minutes to the top of the main strip. The strip is so long you'll never walk it all and it is loaded with bars, restaurants and shops. After awhile you'll get really sick of the \"Come look in my shop. Just browsing.\" And they even bug you to come in their restaurants which is odd. The restaurants were never busy and there is a delicious pizza shop called \"That's Amore\" I forced my husband to eat at three times. Also, there is a really beautiful shop full of authentic shells this American artist turned into light fixtures, called Maya-xel. BUGS: Mosquitos and other evil beasts are all over at night. Bring tons of bug spray. Like four bottles. Not kidding. TULUM: We loved our day trip to Tulum.

My brother and I did extensive research on the internet before deciding on the Mahekal. Because it's the low season, we paid bargain prices. Of course, it's hurricane season, so we knew the risk, and sure enough, Tropical Storm Alex hit the beach the same day we arrived! But, regardless of the rain and wind for the first 3 days, we had a great time in the water, at the resort and around town and a lot of that was due to the incredible staff at the Mahekal. The resort has a very familial feel to it. I have travelled enough to foreign areas to know that things don't always look the same in real life as they do on the internet. The Mahekal looks just like the pictures on it's website. It is about a 45 minute taxi ride from the airport at Cancun. The resort is well kept, incredibly clean, has very friendly staff, excellent food with a nice selection...even some for vegetarians such as myself, good drinks, convenient location to the main strip for shopping, the most gorgeous stretch of beach in Playa, 24 hr. security around the resort and on the beach, a great concierge who will be glad to arrange tours for you and if you have any concerns, the front desk will do their best to take care of your needs with a warm smile. One thing to note...there are no T.V.'s in the rooms or phones, which we knew ahead of time. That didn't bother me, even through 3 days of drenching rain and wind from the tropical storm. If you like to read before bed, then bring a book! If you forget... like I did..there's a library in the lobby with many interesting novels left by previous visitors that you can borrow. The bungalows are unique and more natural than your usual hotel room, because of the palm thatched roof. The roof is quite tall and goes up to a peak, so you have a feeling of spaciousness. The floors are lovely ceramic tiles. The bathrooms have beautiful painted tiles in the showers. The towels are plush and new looking. The beds are clean and very comfortable. The windows are louvered wooden slats that you can open to let the nice breeze in. There are screens on the windows. There were no mosquitoes while we were there...perhaps because of the wind from the storm. There's also A/C in the rooms, if you prefer that and ceiling fans. There are 2 hammocks on each balcony. The resort provides a free, large bottle of drinking water everyday when they clean the room. You can buy more for $2.00 a bottle. The maids make cool towel sculptures each time they change your bed. There's a safe in the closet. There are 2 swimming pools that are clean with beautiful landscaping and the occasional iguana peeking out at you. You can eat breakfast and lunch at one of the resort restaurants that has a thatched roof and faces the beach with large, open windows. Tons of fresh fruit, cereal, croissants, sweet breads, yogurt, juices, oatmeal, sausages and more are at the breakfast buffet and you can order eggs, omelets, pancakes, etc.. We ate lunch out everyday and then ate dinner at the resort. There's a separate restaurant for the night meal that has a natural rain forest feel to it, surrounded by large palm trees and other landscaped vegetation. It has no walls, but a large thatched roof, ceramic tile floors, white table cloths, nice selection of food at the buffet or you can order from the menu, lovely music which is sometimes live, candlelight..very romantic feel to it. The Mahekal is the pearl of the beach. You will not be disappointed! P.S. Just F.Y.I...The only con of our trip that I would add has nothing to do with the Mahekal but sadly with our tour to Chichen Itza which is a 3 hour bus ride from Playa. I have seen other Mayan ruins and was looking forward to the tour, but there are so many vendors/gypsy types all over the site that they ruin the experience. It's hard to take a photo without someone trying to sell some tourist trinket to you. It would be fine if the vendors were corralled near the entrance, but they are free to go wherever they want, apparently, and there seems to be hundreds of them. I have heard that Coba is the better ruin to visit and it's only 45 minutes from Playa, which includes a stop at Tulum.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phillipsburg, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cOur wonderful week at Mahekal Beach Resort\u201d", "Author": "ClaudiaJo", "ReviewID": "UR70050179", "Content": "I loved everything about Mexico and the Mahekal Beach Resort. Everyone we met there was friendly. It was nice being away from TV and computer. If you do bring a laptop there is computer access in the bar and lobby. Transportation to Hotel : We booked ahead with Cancun Transfers. I would recommend them. Paid with credit card when booking and tipped with US cash. Driver stopped along the way to the hotel so we could get a cold beer for the ride. [insert link] Mahekal Beach Resort: Beautiful smaller hotel with bungalows. We stayed in an oceanfront bungalow on the beach, 1C. Loved it. We never felt we didn't have privacy. We loved that we could just step out onto the beach. We could hang out on our porch to look at the beautiful ocean, watch the sunrise and people watch. Our bungalow had two queen beds and a bathroom. There was a small safe in the room that opens/locks with a key. Air conditioning was fine. Our housekeeper left beautiful towel art every day. There was a hairdryer provided. We asked for an iron and ironing board and kept it in our room all week. There are two pools (medium-sized), that never seemed to be crowded. Two restaurants, one which served breakfast and lunch. The other dinner. One bar with pool table and ping pong table. The staff , Gabriel, Boli, Jorge, Vicente (bartender), and everyone else were so nice and helpful. Coffee is served in the AM at the bar and in the Aventura restaurant. It usually was out by 6:30. We bought a coffee maker, coffee, sugar, sweetener, and non-refrigerated cream at Mega and used it in our room for the week. We are early risers. From the resort we could walk to 5th Ave in a few minutes. Very safe. We walked to Mega also. Taxis are always available and are inexpensive. Cab drivers took pesos or US dollars. Beach: Beautiful beach with no rocks and very little seaweed. The beach is raked daily. Water ranged from very calm to having some pretty good waves. There were no issues with getting a chaise lounge every day. There are plenty. The beach is good for walking and/or jogging. We took a walk every morning. You can also have your lunch served on the beach as well as drinks. Security: Always had two security guards on the beach (24x7). Never felt any concerns about security at the hotel or in town. Places to Eat - Recommended Mahekal - Breakfast Buffet which had fresh juice and fruit; eggs (including Mexican skillet egg dishes), pancakes, french toast to order; sausages, hash browns, toast, croissants, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal. Wonderful! Mahekal - Dinner - Sunday nights is Mexican night with buffet and band. It was fun! El Fogon - We went twice and loved it. Authentic, non-touristy, inexpensive and great food. Very casual. We had the frijoles charros (bean soup), tacos el pastor (tacos with pork), and arrachera (flank steak). We washed it down with cold Mexican beer. Piola - This is right up the road from the Mahekal. Great margharitas, bruschetta, and pizza. The salads were good as well. Great atmosphere and service. http://www.piola.it/mondo2.php?menu_number=3&lang=en&id=32 Origenes- Also right up the road from the Mahekal. We stopped in for drinks and appetizers. Great service and live music. We wanted to go back for dinner but ran out of time. Tour: We did the Tulum and Beyond Tour and had a great time. We would definitely recommend this company! They pick up / drop off at your hotel. They provide drinks and snacks. We toured the Tulum ruins, snorkeled in two cenotes, and hung out on a secluded Tulum beach. Our guides set-up and served us lunch on the beach at Tulum. We booked it the day before and paid in US cash. We also included a tip for our tour guide Ader and driver Pablo. http://www.yucatreks.com/ Stores: There is a store right across the street from the Mahekal that sells ice, beer, soda, water, snacks, etc. Opens at 9:00AM. They took pesos or US dollars. There is a store that opens earlier that sells the same (and throw-away cameras). Go up the street to the circle and make a right. The store is down a bit on the left side of the street. Mega is like a Walmart. They have food, clothes, appliances, etc. Can walk there in about 15 minutes or take a cab for a few dollars. There are cabs lined up in front when you leave. Money / ATMs: Used an ATM at the Cancun airport and Mega to get out pesos. Tipping: We tipped Mahekal employees in either pesos or US dollars - no issues. We tipped daily for housekeeping, breakfast, lunch, and drinks. Sunscreen: Brought high SPF sunscreen with us and needed it. Purchased additional at a store on 5th Ave. Bug Spray: Brought bug spray with us just in case. Used one day only on our porch for some mosquitos. We also needed it on the Tulum trip.

From reading almost every review on TripAdvisor, we knew that this hotel would provide us with the most relaxed and quiet atmosphere in the area and we were right. There were a few flaws we experienced that I assume are rare based off of other reviews. The disappointments: -When making our reservation we specified that we were on our honeymoon. The hotel offers a complimentary honeymoon package (sparkling wine, fruit basket, etc) in room. When we arrived we did not received this package and had to ask THREE times for it, each time we were assured it would be delivered that day. By mid-week we gave up. It was disappointing to be promised something and not delivered. -The oceanfront rooms are mostly 2 beds, and despite asking for a king bed prior to arrive(we are on our honeymoon) we were placed in a room with two beds. Again, not a big deal, but the reception desk was very unhelpful with this situation. -If you are in the Adventura section and there is a wedding going on you will be up until at least midnight listening to the loud party. The wedding receptions are in the casa bar/lounge and the music is so ridiculously loud that for two nights that we experienced weddings, we were without sleep. I would recommend staying in the Caribe section, if possible for this reason. -In our experience, the folks at reception were pretty useless and vague with answers. From the honeymoon package to exchanging money, we got a lot of \"no\" answers and not a lot of help from them. It seems this is the biggest flaw in the whole resort, based on other reviews, but definitely not a deal-breaker. Now...on to the good!!! The resort is on the north side of Playa, which is so dramatically different from the beaches closer to the main strip. We were right next to the local entrance to the beach, but the beach somehow remains empty and beautiful. The security is amazing. At no point did we feel unsafe as they are patrolling all day and night. We always had lounge chairs on the beach available for us and the beach/water was always clean and beautiful. The waitstaff are amazing!!! They are attentive and kind and do the best to make your stay enjoyable. Breakfast is a buffet with egg and pancake to order options. You do not need to charge anything for breakfast, but we tipped our waiter daily because he did a good job! You have the option to have either lunch or dinner at the hotel, if you choose lunch you must inform the front desk before 12:30 that day. Lunch is MUCH better than dinner, with options from club sandwiches to delicious mexican specialities. I highly recommend the Res Y Locos tacos! Dinner changed every night and we only enjoyed the Mexican Fiesta night, which was a buffet. Most of the time the meals were pretty bland and bad. If you like cats, you'll enjoy the two local kitties that join guests for dinner and beg you for scraps. You never need money at meals because everything you drink at the meals and bar can be charged to your room. The walk to La Quinta is right up the street, taking no more than 5 minutes to get there. Mahekal is on the quiet Italian stretch of La Quinta, which is much nicer in our option than the crazy touristy area closer to the Cozumel Ferry, unless that is your scene. You HAVE to eat at La Cueva De Chango restaurant right up the street from the hotel. The food and atmosphere is amazing and the artwork is done by one of the servers. Yaxche Mayan cuisine on La Quinta is highly recommended as well. We were in the middle of Tropical Storm Alexander when we were there and the rooms are made to let in a lot of breeze and light, so the rain and wind flooded the room a bit over the weekend. However, the staff were quick to clean it up and were constantly grooming the grounds during the storm. The cleaning staff are amazing and will create beautiful towel sculptures on your bed every day!! **A word to the wise. These rooms are your basic rooms with no frills. The rooms are also on the beach and have lots of bugs. If we left any piece of food, gum, candy, or soda out for more than 15 minutes we had swarms of ants. Do not bring sweets as the ants will go nuts for them, unless you don't mind the company! :)", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cThe secret beauty of Playa\u201d", "Author": "cedric02", "ReviewID": "UR69401976", "Content": "Working in the luxury hospitality industry, I spent so much time online looking at all the resorts in PLAYACAR and their reviews on Tripadvisor.

We did not miss any of those things when we were there and can't wait to return next year!! We stayed in 29P and it had a great view of the ocean.

The resort is very quiet, very clean and well kept. There are plenty of chairs on the beach for the taking, the pools are never over-crowded and the ocean was warm, clear and amazing. The beach was very clean, never too crowded, we found a nice spot to the far right of the Aventura side in the shade that was great for a post lunch ciesta. The resort staff was always very courteous and willing to assist you in any way. We had a ocean view room (11A or Once A) which was great. We could easily see the beach from our porch hammocks and could feel the constant breeze all day, which was amazing. The room was great, very basic, very clean and relaxing. Great shower and bathroom. We selected the breakfast and lunch option which worked out great for us. Up early in the morning for a run or a walk on the beach (which my girlfriend loves to do...), followed up with an excellent breakfast. I can't imagine anyone not being satisfied with the selections available at breakfast. Tons of healthy options that is unless you are use to dining at a Denny's Mega breakfast buffet, this might not be the place for you. Lunch was good too. It was nice to be able to come in from the beach, grab a bite and then get back out to the beach for the rest of the afternoon. A lot of 5th Ave opens around 10-11AM, so lunch options are available there, but it is several blocks away. To do's: Be sure to go to 5th Ave in the evening for nightlife, drinking, dining and shopping. A great time. After dinner buy a nice cigar from one of the many shops and hit up one of the many dessert / wine bars. Also be sure to rent the hotel bikes and cruise up and down the back streets of Playa to see the rest of the city outside of 5th ave. Also a great time. We hit 3 or 4 different beach bars on our bike journey and had a lot of fun.

You can walk to Fifth Avenue, which is the main strip and it is nicer on the north half than the southern half; however, the streets between Fifth and the beach are more local and less tourist-y, and have some nice surprises like a really good tequila bar. Mahekal doesn't offer that many activities, and you can't snorkel right off the beach (nothing to see). But if you rent a car, you can go to nearby cenotes, and Xel-Ha.

If you want renaissance splendor with marble and crystal, a Jacuzzi on your balcony, five restaurants where you line up at 6 a.m. to make reservations and pools where you can play the towel game to your heart\u2019s content, then this place is not for you. If you want beaches where you\u2019re lying inches away from someone talking nonstop on their cell phone, this place is not for you. And if you cannot live without television or a phone in the room for 24 hour room service, this place is not for you. On the other hand, if you want a small, intimate, laid back beach resort with colorful palapa style accommodations where you can laze away an afternoon on your patio in your hammock; if you want beautifully maintained grounds where paths meander throughout, connecting the cabanas, pools, bar, and restaurant; if your idea of a perfect beach is lying under a palapa, far enough away from others so that there is a sense of privacy, then this place is for you. I would definitely describe Mahekal as barefoot chic, with excellent attentive service, whether you\u2019re at breakfast, dinner, by the pool, or on the beach. THE ROOM We had a ground floor cabana in the Pueblo section, set in the garden and close to the La Loma restaurant. This was a very quiet section of the resort, and after seeing the other areas, I was glad we chose to be set back a bit. I felt that there was more privacy and less foot traffic of people coming and going past your patio. The room was small but spotless, and the A/C was the best we had anywhere. In case you get chilled like we did, there is an extra blanket in the top part of the large closet. Speaking of closet, there were tons of hangers, lots of shelf space, and a small safe that will hold passport, money, etc., but not your laptop. There was always plenty of hot water which came up very fast. The patio had two hammocks, and a table with two chairs. Every day we received a bottle of water, and some extremely creative towel art from the ladies who do the housekeeping. THE FOOD Having read the very mixed reviews, we were a bit concerned but need not have been. Breakfast was amazing, and so extensive that I do not understand how anyone can possibly have lunch afterwards, provided they took full advantage of the buffet. There were always two different kinds of juices (varied from day to day), fresh fruit: papaya, mango, cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple, bananas and grapefruit. They had plain and fruit yogurts, several different kinds of cold serial, and the most delicious hot oatmeal. There was also ham and cheese and sausages put out every morning, along with hash brown cakes and different kinds of bread. On top of this, you could order eggs any style: poached, scrambled, ranchero, boiled, fried, eggs motulenos, or toluquenos, (two delicious Yucatecan style), you name it. After all this food, lunch was not happening. Dinner was almost always very good. We ate dinner out twice, once because we wanted to go back to Yaxche after a terrific lunch there last time (big disappointment), and the other night because the a la carte menu did not appeal to us (salmon with chaya and chicken with mushrooms). The other nights ranged from the good to the outstanding. They especially went all out for the buffets. Maya night they had Salbutes, which are little tortillas filled with shredded chicken, avocado, and onions, Yucatecan chicken, cochinita pibil, fish baked with achiote paste, fried plantains, rice and beans, fantastic little meat balls, etc. The Mexican BBQ buffet had the best skirt steak, so tender, and delicious, grilled chicken, grilled fish, ribs, sausages, and lots of sides like guac and pico de gallo, and rice. On another occasion they had fish in parsley sauce, steak brochettes (delicious), duck breast with mango sauce (wonderful), and pork with tamarind sauce (this was only ok because it was a bit too sweet for me.) I was disappointed in seeing the menu for the day we were leaving: Caribbean buffet with paella, shrimps in wine sauce, and some other things that looked really good. I would recommend not missing any of the buffets. Those were our favorite meals. They also make terrific soups: pozole, sopa Azteca, and a German soup with cabbage and sausages that we did not try but sounded good. Menu for two days at a time is posted in the lobby in the morning, and you can switch out dinner for lunch if it doesn\u2019t appeal to you. SERVICE Everyone, from reception to wait staff, housekeeping, grounds crew, and so on was very friendly, helpful, and professional. Special mention to Rogelio, Ignazio, Juan, and Ivan, but not mentioning any other names does not imply they were lacking. This was an incredibly nice staff, one that really contributed to making our stay special. There is service around the pool up front by the ocean, and also on the beach. So if you want to eat or drink something without leaving your lounger, they\u2019re there for you. Security is top notch; there are several guards patrolling both the beach and the grounds around the clock. There is free wireless access available in the lobby and the bar by the pool. Pretty zippy, so there is no interminable waiting for pages to load. There is also a massage hut along with other spa services offered. Bikes are available for guests and are a good way to get around. POOLS There is one pool by the bar where they hold happy hour and another up front by the ocean, where the Aventura restaurant is. We preferred the one by the ocean for the view, the water was cooler, and it was deeper. Plus it was just a hop to the beach, so you can go back and forth between the two. The other pool heated up very quickly so it was more like sitting in your bath tub. Plus it tended to be more crowded, and the water is very shallow. That makes it better for children. DRINKS Between 5 and 6 drinks are two for one and the frozen margaritas are outstanding. They are 45 pesos each, except during happy hour, so even at regular time they\u2019re a bargain. I loved the fact that they were nice and tart instead of the sweet mix so many places uses. I also had a pina colada at the bar up by the beach which was great and so strong there must have been mostly rum in it lol. Bloody Mary\u2019s are also terrific, and the restaurant La Loma serves wonderful wine, both red and white, for 50 pesos a glass. A terrific deal for \u201cwinos\u201d like ourselves \uf04a The happy hour bar could use a little sprucing up to make it more inviting. A few more tables with chairs, a some more bar stools would definitely help. THE BEACH Just beautiful, soft sand, turquoise water, gentle waves (except for the first couple of days), and perfect temperature. There are plenty of loungers with palapas, so you do not have to play the towel game. MISCELLANEOUS We didn\u2019t spend much time in town, but it\u2019s there if you need it for nightlife, dinner, shopping, seeing and being seen, etc. We ate once at Babe\u2019s Noodle Bar, which was very good and very inexpensive. The restaurant Yaxche moved, and unfortunately seems to have left its Maya identity and food behind in the old location. I will review it separately, but it was a big disappointment after our last visit. If you need laundry done, there is one on the right side of the street the hotel is on, between 5th and 10th avenue. Open at 8:00, and done in an hour. We paid 45 pesos for about 4 pounds of clothes. All in all we had a wonderful time, and will definitely be back to the Mahekal. It certainly lived up to its name. For around 120 dollars per day we had a terrific room in a beautiful place, and breakfast and dinner for two.

You are only a short stroll to the superb 5th Avenue restaurants and shopping. Eldiablo Cha Cha Cha and also Casa Abela is a must for eating/drinking. The hotel is just outside of the strip although we saw this as a benefit and each night we took the hotel bicyles to ride around the corner to the bars and restaurants in 5th Ave. We enjoyed the ride each night to and from the hotel. The beach was beautiful and we had an Ocean View (not ocean front) room and it would be recommended that you get one. The hotel was very clean and tidy and everyone was very helpful with every request. The concierge managed to arrange a last minute trip across to Isla Cozumel for scuba diving with a dive master that he knew. We got across just in time and had a private lesson with the dive master Edmundo, ask for him, his company is called Cha Cha Cha. We would recommend this hotel because it was just outside of the busy strip but close enough to be a short walk away. It would suit man different people and young couples in particular.

We all went as a family trip, with an almost two year old and seven year old. Even after much urging from my sister for us to get an ocean view room, we reserved the garden view caribe. So our first night was in 28A garden view room, and decided she was right, to move to an ocean view. The rooms really vary, and the garden view ones with two beds are small. My sister\u2019s room was nice in the garden section one bed, with the palapa style roof. We moved to 16P, which was A lot nicer than our original room. Amazing difference, huge room, with balcony, and great view, in the adventura section. There happened to be a monsoon during our stay, and unfortunately it rained so hard, the palapa roof of our room leaked and it flooded the floor, and made the beds wet. So had to move again, and Mahekal did so graciously. The room was not as nice, but it worked. All the rooms are quite simple, with tile floors, firm beds, and wood shutters for the windows, and had it been sunny I think they are very nice. With the wind going so strong it made it loud through the night. I liked the beachy feel and primitive nature of the room, but being that our power went out one night, and had a problem with the rain another, it would have been nice have a phone in the room. Hard to trek down to the lobby in that kind of weather to get some help. Note: Bring flashlights. You can hear the ocean from your room, and the beach is fantastic. Perfect beach, with gentle waves the kids could play in. The view from the breakfast room is breathtaking, and the pool is perfect for dipping, and running down to the beach. We thought the food was great! We liked the French toast and pancakes in the morning for kids, along with an array of fresh fruits and pastries. I loved the Huevos Rancheros. We ate for three nights at the hotel, and enjoyed all of them. Our table was decorated extra special two nights, and it really made our trip special. The servers here are wonderful, made us and our kids feel welcome. Rogelio was so sweet and attentive; my son just loved a balloon animal he made for him. Reuben was so attentive, warm, and made our meals just perfect. I thought Mahekal was a beautiful resort with gorgeous landscape. You walk through the property and think they have maintained keeping an it lush, beachy, and exotic. The birds you hear in the morning, trees, and sandy pathways, really let you experience paradise. You are not paying so much for the amenities at this resort, but more the beachfront experience. There is a sulphur odor to the beach, and I kept thinking about it, so I do say, \u201calmost paradise\u201d, in my title with that, and because we did not get to go to the beach a lot with the rain. Both are not the resorts fault, but had an impact n our stay. With children it might be worth noting, there is not too much activities in the room, or the resort except for the beach, or a wonderful so if something happens with the weather you do have to get creative. Like hang out at Mega, store in Playa. \uf04a We did try the bar and played pool and ping pong, and that is the extent of a children\u2019s area. It didn\u2019t really affect us, but would be nice to have more for kids to do. The best part of our trip was the beach massage. It is a must try!

However, we are not \"all inclusive\" type of people and ended up at Mahekal on a suggestion from a friend. Glad we did. Although I had requested an early check in via email we were not given one. I understand this policy when a hotel/resort is at capacity but I am 99% sure that this was not the case. We were only an hour early but they still made us wait. Luckily we had a car so we left our stuff locked up and headed to the beach. The location is AMAZING. We opted for one of the cheaper palapas and were less than a minute from the beach. Plenty of chairs and umbrellas for guests to use and the towels that we were given were big and soft. Major complaint here is that the beach had a sulfer smell to it. I don't know if this is the norm or if something was going on, but we jokingly referred to it as \"Egg Beach\" all weekend. Our room was on the second level. Some concerns: When sleeping with our heads by the headboard it felt like our feet were higher, which was very uncomfortable. The first night we ended up sleeping with our heads on the opposite side, which resulted in the air conditioning blowing directly on top of our heads. The next night we decided to just deal with it and went to bed normally and found that the condensation from the air conditioner would occasionally drip water on our heads while trying to sleep. No bueno! The air does not filter into the bathroom and so it is very hot in there. There are bugs, but this was to be expected. Just tiny ants, not a big concern at all. Overall the room was a little stale smelling and there just wasn't enough wind to air it out. The balcony was amazing and the hammocks that they provide are extremely comfortable and fun to hang out in. Bonus points for having an outdoor fan. We loved both of the pools and the bar with the swings. Last but not least, the food is mediocre at best. The included food was a bonus for us, we did not book at this hotel knowing that we were going to get a breakfast and dinner. However, if this is something that is going to make or break the deal for you I will say that I would MUCH rather dine anywhere else.

Playa was receiving more rain when we arrived than they had in 15 years, and the resort staff worked hard to deal with it, but they weren't very prepared. To be fair, I'm going to skip any issues related to the ridiculous amounts of rain. Mahekal is a small resort, made up of mostly individual bungalows and 2 story casitas, so you'll likely get your own private cabana, or have just one neighbor above or below you. The grounds are well maintained and everything in the resort is within a short walk. It's definitely a charming little place with tons of character and potential. It was quiet and peaceful for the most part. Surprisingly, most of the food was really good (better than we had at the Riu last October). The breakfasts were marginal (cooked to order egg dishes), but they serve lots of fresh fruit. Lunch can be served to you on the beach, and I recommend the Mexican Platter to split for two of you. That's all we tried on the lunch menu, but it was really good and plenty for lunch. Dinner was really good when served a la carte. When it was a buffet, it was hit or miss. Our last night there, my boyfriend and I made several trips to the buffet - once for chips and quacamole, once for salads, then again for our dinner. This was much more enjoyable that loading up one plate with a bit of everything. They serve a grilled fish at almost every meal, and they were all delicious. Alcoholic drinks are not included in the room price; they are reasonably priced ($3 beer, $4 margarita), but not very consistent. The first drink I had was really good, but it was downhill from there. They make each drink individually (no bulk premix), but never measure, so you never know what you're going to get. It takes quite a long time to get a drink at the bar, then you have to wait for the guy to print out a room charge bill to sign. Real inefficient. Aside from the grounds being well planted and maintained, the common gathering areas are far less than impressive. Especially the bar and gameroom. It has 2 pool tables, 2 ping pong tables, and an 80's style big screen tv. There are no more than 10 wobbly bar stools, and maybe 15-20 other chairs, along with 3-4 odd tables. It was dark and really uncomfortable, and getting drinks took a lot of effort. We probably wouldn't have spent any time in there had it not been raining so much or there was another place to gather with our friends. Our room, 19C, definitely needed some attention. They do a real good job keeping it clean, but it was long overdue for a fresh coat of paint and new tiling. The a/c leaked - not good when it's just above the head of the bed. And it blew straight down, again onto the head of the bed, even when we adjusted it. The matresses were decently comfortable, but the sheets and blankets were old and yucky. We spent as little time inside the room as possible because it just wasn't comfortable. The hammocks on the balcony were quite nice, however, and it seemed that a lot of guests were using them as a place to get out of the sun or rain (or room) for a while. I had read most of the TripAdvisor reviews before arriving at Mahekal. Unfortunately, I was pretty dissapointed.

We were going to switch our dinner for lunch but found the evening restaurant to be relaxing, nicely lit and besides the food, the best part was the wait staff who are very attentive, friendly and helpul. 4 of the 7 nights were full service, 4 course sit down meals and 3 were buffet. Our favourites were the served meals and some of the memorable dishes were salmon in a spinach cream sauce, chicken and mushrooms, advocado and shrimp salad, and duck in a citrus sauce. The kids enjoyed the pasta dishes and the mexican buffets. The homemade soups were some of the best ever. My husband raved about the steak on the mexican barbecue buffet, and given we come from Alberta Beef Country that is saying a lot! As well as the wait staff being great, we also found our maid went above and beyond making towel art unlike any I have seen before, and Jose, the artist who paints ceramics, is very talented and a pleasure to be around. Our sons spent hours painting ceramics with him and were thrilled with the results. We spent lots of time at the resort, on the beach, at the bar playing pool and table tennis and at the pool.

THE FOOD: Breakfast and dinner (or lunch) was included which was very cost-effective. Unfortunately I suffer from a severe reaction to garlic: at Mahekal this proved no problem. On the first night I talked to the chef and he offered to make up a special plate for me which our waiter served even on the buffet nights. It was refreshing to stay in a place in which the staff confronted exceptions with graciousness. THE ROOM: We stayed in a section called \"Pueblita Garden View\" which I recommend for two reasons: it is the least expensive and the quietest. The oceanfront (too expensive) are nicely situated but the porches are private only early in the mornings or late in the afternoons. Otherwise there are always people on chaises right up against your steps. It is also true that if you are in a room near Calle 38 which provides public access to Playa Mamitas you're likely to find the traffic noise bothersome. Stay in the Garden View Pueblitas for comfort and quiet. The 50 meter walk to the beach will do you good. The room itself was clean, spacious and airy; the porch with twin hammocks was relaxing; the maid service was professional. THE BEST PARTS: The beach was wide, clean and uncrowded. A 10 minute walk in either direction will bring you to a beach that is narrower, dirtier, rockier, more crowded and throbbing to the beat of high-volume hip-hop. If you find that attractive, Mahekal is not for you. In addition the staff is friendly, helpful and professional.

The beach was pristine and, when we were there, we always found plenty of lounge chairs available. The swimming was wonderful in the ocean and the pools (the pools were a bit chilly but we attributed that to the weather-- the Yucatan peninsula was experiencing an unusual cool snap). We also enjoyed happy hour on the swings at the palapa bar. Makehal is a 5-10 minute walk from the shopping and restaurants of Playa del Carmen, which is a fun place to visit. Something else that really sets this resort above the others we've visited is the personal, friendly service. By our second day, the waiters knew our names and where we were visiting from.

I had spent weeks reading reviews and doing research on TripAdvisor, so I felt pretty prepared and confident that this would be a wonderful beach vacation. For the most part, it was. The Mahekal is beautiful and comfortable (great beds and hammocks!), and when it is warm and sunny, the beach is great (except for the dredging; see below). I'd like this review to be helpful, so there are a few things I think you might like to know before you go. 1. The weather in January is not necessarily warm. - I obsessed over the weather before we went, checking the 10-day forecast as if it were the Bible. Don't bother. The weather will do what it wants, and for us that meant some chilly temperatures, lots of wind, some clouds, rain and some sun. And we were only there for four nights! The weather does seem to set a tone, and when it finally warmed up, everyone seemed cheerier at the resort. 2. Playa del Carmen is not a sleepy little Mexican town. It is more of a city, and some nights you can hear that city traffic from your comfortable hammock on your beautiful Mahekal porch. It was very weird to hear that traffic hum, the motorcycles revving their engines, and the occasional horn or siren. I did not expect this. Also, the 'Quinta', or Fifth Avenue, was not for us. It was nice to have someplace to walk to, and we did have a good dinner there, but it is very commercial and not very Mexican. You can get Starbucks, Haagen Das, or a hamburger. We didn't see a taqueria or tortilleria there. We ended up getting good food at the Mahekal - get the Mexican plate for lunch, and don't miss the Mayan dinner! Also, we bought ceramic bowls at the Mahekal gift shop for less than in town. Another thing is that the beach does not have a clear horizon at night. In the distance you see the lights of the hotels and cruise ships on Cozumel. I would have preferred a more natural horizon. 3. Because of erosion and beach damage, dredging is taking place. We found out that this was the cause of the overwhelming, strong sulfurous smell that permeated the beach. Because I am such a beach person, this really bothered me. I was hoping for the smell of the sea, as were the other guests we spoke with. At first, no one at the resort would acknowledge the odor, but we finally got an answer, and that helped a lot! Knowing that it wasn't sewer or dead fish helped us to enjoy the beach more. 4. Tulum is a fantastic day trip, and the ruins at Tulum provide access to an amazing beach. I knew there was a beach in Tulum, but I thought that meant the town, and not the actual ruins area. If you go to the ruins, and I highly recommend it, wear your bathing suit and bring your beach bag (don't leave it in the car, as we did). After you walk around the ruins, go down the stairs to the beach. If you are a beach lover, you will never want to leave. Absolutely gorgeous! 5. I would highly recommend getting a car. It's not a difficult drive to the Mahekal, and it's easy to go to Tulum or Coba for the day. If we had not had a car when it was chilly in Playa del Carmen, we wouldn't have enjoyed ourselves as much. There is really nothing to do at the Mahekal if you aren't at the beach, the pool or the bar. On a couple of days it was too windy to enjoy the beach, and the pools aren't anything to write home about (I don't care because I'm there for the beach). It's great that the Mahekal is so close to town, but you can only walk down the Quinta so many times. 6. Finally, though I thought there were a few times when the service could have been better, I actually started to cry when checking out to leave this magical place. Others have written about this man at the front desk, Boli, who makes you feel like family. He is wonderful, and on the whole, this is a great place. You don't need a cabana on the beach; all of them are gorgeous and comfortable. When we go back to Mexico, it won't be to Playa del Carmen because the town is too big and commercial and there's too much going on around the beach (cruise ships, jet skis, beach clubs). We definitely will go back to the Tulum area, but when we do, I hope we find a place as beautiful as the Mahekal.", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBeach, Sun, good food and very relaxing!\u201d", "Author": "denmil", "ReviewID": "UR53615709", "Content": "We just came back from Mahekal Beach Resort.

We were 3 couples of which 2 with children, so the resort had to meet quite a few expectations. In the end we decided to stay in Mahekal and our friends with children in the Sandos Caracol, about a 50 mins. walk along the beach up north. Our welcome to the resort was very disappointing. We arrived fairly late (8pm) after a horrible journey of 17 hours from Birmingham (UK), but the receptionist did not seem to care at all and did not bother to ask us how the journey had been. He managed to mumble 'welcome to Mahekal' and told us to sign the check-in form and reminded us that we had to pay the remaining balance then and there. I asked him whether we could do that the next day as we had had such a long journey and I wanted to check the amount. Under protest and stating that he was doining us a huge favour, he agreed. I believe his name is Raphael/Raffa. As soon as we were escorted to our Pueblito by one of the staff members, we forgot about the incident. The 'pueblitot' was in Mexican style with ditto interior. Very nicely done, clean and with plenty of space for clothes and suitcases. The bathroom had a big shower and the bed was big and very comfortable. The hut has a very spacious balcony/veranda and comes with two hammocks. The room was cleaned every day and clean towels were provided every day as well. We had asked for a top floor pueblito and were able to move the next morning without a problem. No TV or radio in the room, but we had no need for them anyway! The resort has been set up very well, with many footpaths connecting the 2 swimming pools and restaurants. We stayed in a pueblito at the back which we preferred as it was more quiet than the 'huts' on the beach (who I have to admit had amazing views out over the sea and were bigger). We had booked half board. Breakfast was buffet-style with plenty of choice. In addition, you could order any type of egg dish or pancakes. The egg dishes were delicious. We had dinner the first night, but weren't impressed and decided to swap dinner for lunch and ended up doing so for the rest of our stay as lunch was a-la-carte and much better. Staff in the restaurants were brilliant. Always in good spirit and very attentive. The beach is probably the best beach in Playa and Riviera Maya. We walked quite a long way across the beach on a few occasions, and the sand here is cleaner and whiter and the sea is very accessible without having to struggle your way in because of rocks. The swimming pool at the back is mainly used for diving refreshers or courses, but the one at the sea front is very nice and great if you have kids and want to be close to the beach at the same time. The staff also allow you to have lunch on the grass next to the swimming pool, with a great view of the beach and ocean. There are plenty of mosquitos, but you find them everywhere so make sure you stock up on repellent. The resort is about a 5/10 mins walk from La Quinta, a nice pedestrianised street with loads of shops, bars and restaurants. We can recommend La Case del Agua on La Quinta and 2nd. Great seafood and a wide selection of wines. Some side notes: 1. as the resort was fully booked, they ran out of beach towels for 2 days in a row 2. our shower had little or no pressure and it was difficult to regulate the temperature 3. Mahekal is only 500 meters away from Las Mamitas, a beach club with live DJs. They start playing at about 2pm and usually stop at around 10pm. The music is quite present and although we quite like a dance on the beach every now and then, I can imagine that some people would fine it disturbing. Overall I would recommend this place, although I think it is a bit too expensive for what you get (we paid USD 282 per night as it was high season). Maybe interesting for people considering either Mahekal or Sandos Caracol: We spent quite a few nights in Sandos with our friends (security was nowehere to be found) and found that Mahekal was a much better choice. The food in Sandos was very disappointing (we managed to have a few meals with our friends free of charge as they do not seem to check bracelets!). As it was peak season, it was impossible to reserve for the a-la-carte restaurants and our friends had to eat in the buffet restaurants (of which the International one was the only good one). Our friends had booked the Select Club, but did not manage to benefit from the extras (special restaurants were fully booked, they could not find the Kids Club until the very last day, no nanny service available on some evenings etc.). The beach is nice at Sandos, but it is a nightmare to get into the open sea as an adult as you have to climb over slippy sand bags and most of that part of the sea is bordered with ropes as the rest is for the jet skis. So no chance of a good and far swim for swimming fanatics like me! Sandos counts over 900 rooms, Mahekal has about 109.. Overall I would not opt for Sandos if you prefer a smaller resort closer to the centre of Playa. But then Sandos is all-inclusive and Mahekal is not (prices were similar).", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "McLean, VA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place, even better as Mahekal\u201d", "Author": "JSAATY", "ReviewID": "UR52795575", "Content": "We stayed at the resort from December 28, 2009 to January 4, 2010. We booked an oceanfront room and were wonderfully impressed. We had also stayed here in January of 2009 under former management. Through the transition from Shangri-la-Caribe to Mahekal, the new management has done a great job of preserving the \"feel\" that made Shangri-la such as wonderful property, but also putting in thoughtful upgrades that make the experience even better. There are new showerheads and bedding, hairdryers and other convenience items available, but the atmosphere of the property through the transition is being carefully protected. No TVs or phones in the room, with beachfront property, this is truly a place that you can unplug and have a great time in the ocean and the surf. The standout elements of the property are the food, the careful attention to the lush vegetation, the colorful yet secluded palapas-style rooms, and the wonderful staff. They were always kind and helpful. Oswaldo and Bolle are especially recommended as the kind of caring and competent people that you want to land with at a world-class resort such as this.

He described it as chill and very relaxing. I couldn't agree more. There are no televisions or wifi in the room to distract you. The rooms are relatively simple and kept very clean. All of the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The guy who organizes side trips like fishing and snorkeling was great. He hooked us up with the best guides and activities. I believe his name is Bolli or close to that. Anyway you can find him at his desk in the same area as check in. Happy hour starts at 5pm and most of the people I met there had been coming to this resort for years. In general they were a very relaxed easy going group of vacationers. The hotel is situated at the north end of the beach which is great because it's quieter then some of it's neighbors to the south and you tend to get more locals there getting sun which creates a very nice atmosphere. There tends to be a lot of security everywhere which didn't bother me. It just feels very safe and especially at night when you might be walking along the beach, you feel protected. I felt a lot safer in Playa than most American towns I've been in. The food at the hotel is just average. Not terrible but not great. We ate there half the time and the other half we visited some of the local restaurants in the town. It's just a short walk to town and is a lot of fun there at night. To sum up I would say the resort far surpassed my expectations. It was one of our best vacations ever.

Ours had two queen beds and our friends had a king. The breakfasts were good, although the eggs were often cooked beyond requested. I would agree with another reviewer that the front desk service is much improved, and appreciated. The main bar is great,especially at happy hour, but we often wondered why the other bar never seemed to be open. Sometimes it was hard to get a drink when we were at the Aventura pool. We were very happy that you can now get lunch or dinner with the meal plan. We had lunch most times because there are so many fun restaurants we wanted to hit for dinner, including several great ones very close to the resort.

I loved it! I had never been to Mexico, and this was such a great experience. The hotel itself is comprised of two level buildings (one guest room is on the first level, another guest room is on the second level) and beachfront bungalos. We stayed in a garden room, and it was big enough to fit three people comfortably. The rooms really have no frills at all--it's just a couple of beds, a desk, and a chair--there are no TVs, telephones, or clocks. I thought I wouldn't be able to survive without these things, but it was actually really nice! The only problem is that a clock would have been nice to have an alarm wake me up in time for breakfast (breakfast and dinner are included in the rates, but the breakfast ends at 10:00 am, I think). The bathrooms were spacious, and I loved the tiling details throughout. My brother and his wife stayed in a beachfront bungalo and it was really cool! It was larger than our room and a bit nicer, but still didn't have any frills, which was fine because you really don't need anything when the beach and ocean are literally right outside your door! The breakfasts at the resort were the same almost every day---a waiter took your \"main\" order (waffles, french toast, omlette, etc.) and then you could go to an all you can eat buffet for side items that included hash browns (DELICIOUS!!!!!!), pastries, bacon, sausage, fruit, and toast. Coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice were included. We were on our own for lunch. That was fine with me because I usually pigged out so much during breakfast that I wasn't hungry until dinner. There's also a Walmart a short cab ride away, so we stopped there on our second day to pick up some snacks to tide us over throughout the day. Dinners were really nice and it was obvious that they put alot of effort into them. The waitstaff was GREAT! They did everything with gusto and seemed to truly take pride in their work. I can't say enough great things about them. The dinners were good but I was not in love with them. Usually, we were given 2-3 choices for main dishes, and a couple of days there was a buffet, which was awesome! A couple of days they also had a mariachi group that went table to table singing requests. While I wasn't crazy about the food at every dinner, the attentive staff and fun atmosphere made up for it. One thing that I should mention is that while the hotel provides breakfast and dinner, drinks are not included. My boyfriend usually drinks Coke with his dinner, and he was charged for it. I understand not including alcohol in the all-inclusive price, but I think at the very least, sodas should have been included. I also want to mention that while I love the waitstaff at the hotel, I did not really love the front desk staff. They were pretty slow and just didn't seem nearly as hospitable as the waitstaff. I would absolutely recommend this hotel, especially for people who want a vacation that is super relaxing. There wasn't much going on at night, and it was just completely laid back, which I loved.

No TV, no phone, no iron/ironing board, no fridge, no internet. Basically, no amenities. 2. No comforters on the beds - just a blanket over sheets. 3. Many aunts crawling around the room. 4. Weak air conditioning. 5. Construction - jack hammer next door started at 8:30 AM 6. Rooms are very sparsely decorated.

The front desk staff gave us the option of changing rooms, however none could compete with the one we had, so we decided to stay put and got smart about it. We blocked off the gaps under the patio & entry doors where most of the cold air was escaping. Also, avoid using the fans during the day which can pull down hot air from the vaulted thatched ceilings. The beach here is very wide and nice. There are some small reef areas to snorkel in front of the hotel. Be careful not to bump into any sea urchins! We saw some kind of small ray in the shallow water, as well as quite a few different fish. It isn't mentioned anywhere, and maybe this was a special thing, but we were given the option of swapping dinner for lunch. You just had to decide by 11:30, and you could choose your meal including appetizer and dessert. This is a good option if you want to eat dinner on 5th ave a few times. Say hi to Rogelio! The resort is split by Calle 38, and it appeared most of the south side was closed while we were there. Whether it was because of renovations, or just b/c it is the low season is unknown to me.

For our room, this was only over part of the room, so it wasn't a big deal, just make an effort not to leave stuff like cameras where this can happen.

Some things were really good about this place; others really not so much. We traveled there during Easter week, April 9-16. The weather was nice; Playa was more crowded than my first time in Sept '07 and I probably wouldn't go during a holiday time again. BEACH: The beachfront location is very nice, plenty of chairs and palapas and a nice wide area of sand. The beach clubs a short distance south aren't that great, chairs and people are crammed together on an eroding beach front and I was glad this place had its own beach front. Ocean had waves and strong undertow much of the time. POOLS: This place had two small pools, both were clean and refreshing. The only really annoying thing were a few unsupervised kids screaming and running around at any given time of any day having been abandonded by thoughtless parents. When you're in the pool and getting bumped and splashed by these things, it can really get on your nerves in a small pool. Thankfully some left halfway through my vacation. (See above re avoiding a holiday period). BAR: Drinks are not included, and there is an option of charging drinks to your room or paying at the time of service. We did both, the bill was correct at the end of the stay. The prices were okay, and the drinks were fine. Bartenders were half the time pleasant, the other half not. In the bar area there was a pool table and ping pong which further enticed the presence of the screechy tweens so that area wasn't that great sometimes. Going in to Playa for 2 for 1 happy hours was easy enough a few times, most places seem to have that. FOOD: The food was interesting, I have been to really big all-inclusives before where there are numerous places to eat and dishes offered; this place offered breakfast and dinner in just two places as in, breakfast and grill items were always in one place, and dinner was always only in the other. A few nights were a la carte, the rest were buffet. The a la carte meals were okay, not inedible and not fantastic. The Mexican buffet night was nice with a mariachi band playing and a specialty tequila drink; the Italian buffet night was tasty and the place decorated nicely. Breakfast was fine with a selection of mexican egg dishes (yum!) ROOM: My biggest gripe. I paid for the least expensive room, and it was really awful. It was a big single story palapa which base was concrete - and the bed bases themselves were also concrete slabs! Beds in Mexico are hard enough, and this just made it worse. Threadbare bed linens. There were just 3 lights, 2 of which were sconces (pointing upwards) and all using those dim spiral \"efficient\" bulbs. There was no room mirror, the only mirror was a bathroom mirror that was just shoulders up. I liked the shower, it was a big walk-in concrete shower with good pressure and was always hot enough. Hammock and chair and table set on the little patio, no view of anything so didn't hang out there. Room service was well done. It was clean and they spray and clean for these teeny little ant-like bugs in the bathroom, though on my last day there I ran into a cockroach the size of my head on the floor. (wear shoes in your room if you're on the ground floor) I asked to switch rooms because of the awful bed, I was told they \"were all like that\" and none were available; not a nice response since the place seemed empty at the beginning of the week and many of the more expensive garden view palapa rooms had regular beds and decent mirrors and lighting (you could walk up to empty rooms and look inside). The beach front rooms looked really nice as well, however, it was very windy much of the time the closer you got to the beach. CONCLUSION: If I went again, I'd get the better room and I'd try to avoid a busy time just because it's a small place. It's a hike from 5th avenue so there is a lot of walking if you don't cab it, although you must watch the cab prices. Went to Alux, the cave place, that's a must-see! Take pesos, it's much easier.

Our first impression was not so good. We payed 455.00 a night for an ocean view room. We were brought to a room with a slight glimpse of the water but more of the back of another hut/room. The layout of the property is that of a village of small huts with winding pathways and beautiful plants. Make sure you speak to Bolli, the concierge. He is very helpful and accomodating. He moved us to a wonderful room overlooking the pool and ocean. It was perfect and we were very thankful. One thing no one has mentioned is that the property is divided by a street and public beach entrance. It is not anything to be concerned with and I actually liked being so close to the culture and mexican people. They are so friendly and kind. Another thing we experienced was that the beach was extremely crowded. It felt like Daytona Beach but someone mentioned it was spring break/easter so they were on holiday as well. The food really was good. Breakfast and dinner were included and were quite yummy. I was a bit concerned b/c I have two picky boys but they were very happy. Lunch was also great. No need to leave the resort. Their tacos are delicious, esp. the fish tacos and guacamole!! yum! Margaritas were strong and threw me for a loop! Happy hour is from 5-6 and drinks are 2 for 1. It's a nice social place that we thoroughly enjoyed. The pools are nice and clean and the ocean was incredible!!! We had a great time and would definitley recommend it to anyone.

We booked an Aventura ocean view room and were very happy to get one of the bungalows almost right on the beach. The bungalow was a bit rustic and could use a remodel for sure. Bits of the thatched roof fall down, a few bugs get in and bite you at night, the bathrooms have great Mexican tiles but are quite old, and the cushions on the sofas had heavy mold and staining, you have to put all of your toilet paper in the garbage too. At $400 a night I am not sure these negatives should have been there. On the Plus sides: The bungalow porch was fantastic with great hammocks and the sound of the ocean from our bed was great. They use energy efficient light bulbs which is great. The housekeeping was excellent. Adequate water and towels were provided. The breakfasts were awesome in the morning. The beach was very secure with many guards keeping the guests only at the beach and pool areas. The landscaping was pleasant and tropical. The dinners were not that great and started at 7 PM which is a terrible time if you have young children- we did. The overall service was a mixed bag. The restaurant and bar employees were very helpful and friendly. The front desk staff however was rude and entirely unhelpful. We asked for a crib which never came. We were made to wait while the front desk guy fiddled with one of his electronic gadgets and then he acted like he was doing us a favor by talking to us. The lady concierge told us she had confirmed a taxi hire for the day but the taxi never came. Someone spilled chocolate milk by the pool and it took 24 hours for someone to clean it up despite numerous guards and landscape and maintenance folk wlaking right by it. But the housekeeper was very friendly and very efficient. So all in all the service was not consistent. But if you want a bungalow resort that is right on the beach this is a fantastic choice.

My boyfriend and I just got back from a 6 day stay there. Reading TripAdvisor reviews really helped me out when I was planning this vacation many months ago. One thing that everyone needs to keep in mind when they read these reviews is that each person intercepts things differently and we all have our own tastes. There have been many things that I have read on these reviews that made me extremely nervous for our trip (bugs, terrible tasting food, parties, mean security guards, etc.). None of these happened to us. My boyfriend and I are in our early to mid twenties and were so excited to find a hotel that was did not have \u201cSpring Break 2009\u201d written all over it. We did not want a vacation of public drunkenness, we wanted rest and relaxation and that is exactly what we got. Our room: 13 P. My advice is to look through some of the pictures that have been taken by other reviewers to get an idea of any \u201cspecific\u201d room you would like. I was enamored with a lot of the beach views and thought that was exactly what we were going to get.. and it was\u2026 kind of. Our room was behind the pool so it had a great view of the pool with the ocean behind it. I was quite disappointed as I had double checked the reservations and we were supposed to be on the Caribe side (which I was told had much better views) versus the Aventura side (which had bigger rooms) Upon checking in I was very upset because my boyfriend and I could have slept on a twin bed given the option if we could have had the opportunity for a better view. We stayed with 13 P, in the end, it just wasn\u2019t worth the drama. For future reference confirm and bring a printout. The rooms as mentioned are very very sparse (bed, dresser, chair) Surprisingly we really appreciated this. There was no clock, no phone, and no television. No interruptions. We didn\u2019t come to Shangri La to stay in our room; it was there to sleep in. The beds as described in most reviews are extremely hard (just be forewarned). The hammocks on the balcony are probably the best amenity offered and we loved it. It was wonderful to read your book and listen to the waves. One thing also to note about 13 P or any room in that general vicinity was that it is literally right next door to where breakfast is served. It was not that big of a deal to us as we usually were half away awake when the servers were getting everything ready and a couple of plates clanking together served as our call to get out of bed and start the day..(Who wants to be sleeping all day in paradise anyway?!?) The only issue that my boyfriend pointed out was that there was a burning smell each morning, not quite sure from what, but once I realized it the last day it was pretty potent. To sum it up: Get an ocean view room away from the restaurant and get double/triple confirmation on where you are at. Food: We have never stayed at an inclusive resort and found that Shangri La\u2019s options suited us just fine. The breakfast as everyone has said is incredible. The fruits are fresh and juicy and there are enough options to please even the pickiest eater. We loved not having to \u201ceat\u201d lunch at the hotel. I think if lunch was included we would have felt like we were wasting money by not eating there. We ate out on the town almost every day. Aca Los Tacos has some of the best tacos ever, I highly recommend going and getting the chicken tacos with a side of chips (beware the green salsa makes your stomach churn it\u2019s so hot) and a Cerveza Grande to go along with it. Before arriving in Playa I was horrified as to what dinner would actually be like based on previous reviews and I am a very picky eater. I don\u2019t know what other people are used to but the food is definitely not as terrible as some make it out to be. I preferred the Mexican and Mayan buffet nights as I enjoy that type of food over some of the other nights but regardless the food is the equivalent of any buffet place in the states\u2026 besides who goes to the beach to eat?!? Misc: The happy hour was pretty decent. 2 for 1\u2019s from 5-6, you end up spending about $8 for 4 drinks which is better than most bars. Outside of happy hour I think the beers were about $3 which is still super cheap. We had planned on buying a cooler and packing it with beer but were too lazy to drag it the couple of blocks, but if you are a drinker, this is the way to go. Also, people in previous reviews said that people did not come out early to get beach chairs \u2013 this is a lie. People get out there very early and acquire the best spots with their towels. Be very aggressive if you want a \u201cgood\u201d spot. The beach was wonderful and the guards made it even better. Since every beach in Playa is public it was nice to get some local interaction but privacy as well. We also loved that no one approached us to buy something. We had spent some time in Mazatlan being bombarded by beach merchants and we did not see a single one.. Overall, our trip was wonderful! We plan to return to Playa soon after we see a little bit more of the world. Like everyone else I hope that the Shangri La does not get torn down as it is truly a great place and it is fantastic to see people there for their 11th year in a row.", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cShangri-La was not for us!\u201d", "Author": "haylienick", "ReviewID": "UR26323420", "Content": "My husband and I are in our late twenties and this was our first trip to Mexico.

We found the rooms to be very simple and basic, no extra comforts or luxuries but I guess we did not really need a whole lot since we hoped on not being in our room much. The hotel grounds and beach area were quite crowded and the beach itself is not very wide. The beach chairs were always taken, even first thing in the morning, people laid their towels on them. The guests were primarily middle-aged and tacky midwesterners. No offense, it just seemed that a lot of these people did not even attempt to use one word of Spanish and cared more about taking shots of cheap tequila and buying \"One tequila, two tequila, three tequila...floor\" shirts. I do not think we saw any other younger couples as this seemed like a resort for families and middle aged adults. When trying to sleep, we could hear people screaming and partying. We were hoping for something more romantic and quiet. The only thing we liked about staying here is that it was close the main area of town so we could walk to grab dinner and lunch. We only ate breakfast at Shangri-La, which I stuck with the fruit and oatmeal. The servers were not very friendly but maybe it was because they had to deal with rude people asking for bigger plates. At times, it was embarassing watching Americans interact with the people working there. Overall, we were not impressed with this hotel and maybe it is because it is simply not our kind of place.

I was a little sceptical about paying so much for basic accommodation, but after reading the tripadvisor reviews I thought I'd take the plunge. My wife and I stayed for 10 mights at the beginning of March and we loved it. We were going to stay at Las Palapas as they offered a breakfast only option (as opposed to the Shangri-La's braekfast and dinner plan), but changed our mind after reviewers complained of the noise from the nearby Mamitas beach club. So we chose the Shangri-La. Rooms: We were in room 48A in the Peublito garden section. It was on the ground floor of a 2 storey cabana. The room was spacious and clean with a king size bed and table and chair. It also had 2 built in wardrobes. The bathroom had a wetroom type shower and was tastefully decorated with brightly coloured tiling popular in Mexico. Toilet tissue wasn't allowed to be put into the WC but had to be put into a nearby bin. Even though we were in the garden section, we could still hear the sea quite clearly which was very soothing. The room could have done with a refridgerator to keep drinks cold (you're supplied with a bottle of water each day). We ended up buying a cool box and ice from a nearby supermarket. Restaurants: There were 2 restaurants, one for breakfast nad one for dinner. Tables were always available even during busy times. Bar: This also served as a games room with 2 pool tables a table tennis table and TV. Happy hour was from 5 to 6 when you get 2 drinks for the price of 1. Beach: Situated along one of the best streches of beach in Playa. Seemed to always be a constantly strong breeze on the beach, which was great when it was hot but not so good when it was cloudy. One part is suffering from some erosion. There are always chairs available. The best area seemed to be at the Adventura end of the beach. Massage: My wife had a massge at the hotel. She says it was very good. It was $35 US (500 pesos) for half an hour, which is a little more expensive that other places in town or along the beach. Food: Breakfast was great. We had lunch once, but although value for money the portions were too large for us ofr a lunchtime meal. We both enjoyed all our dinners at the Shangri-La and can't understand the negative comments about the dinners. We ate there every night except one and didn't have a bad meal once. Some nights were better than others, but overall the food was very good. Staff: All the staff were friendly and very helpful.

We have stayed at a variety of five star resorts such as some of the Sandals Resorts throughout the Caribbean, and some 3 star resorts. So the bottom line is we're going to give a fair review. We loved the hotel. As some people wrote, it is a little expensive for a hotel that is not all-inclusive. That and the food (which I'll get into later) is why we gave it a three out of five on Value. However, what you have to realize is that you are not paying for amenities of an all-inclusive. You are paying for the great location and the tranquility of the resort. It is on one of the best stretches of beaches in the Mexican Riviera. It is also on the north edge of Playa Del Carmen for easy access to great dining, night life, and other attractions like water sports. The hotel is not at all crowded. At times you feel like there is hardly anyone there. No need to get up early and reserve chairs at pools or beaches. They are always available. We always had chairs and umbrellas within eyesight of our room. The entire resort is built on the sand. There are neat paths cut through the immaculate landscape that give a very tropical feel. We found the staff to be very accommodating and friendly. We had a few ants in our room on our first night. I went to the front desk and within 5 minutes it was dealt with very efficiently. Rogelio (one of the restaurant wait staff) was super nice and helpful. Overall everyone else was very friendly and professional too. One of the bell boys (regrettably I forget his name) hooked us up with a cooler, free of charge to use during our stay so we could keep pop and beer cold in our room. It was much cheaper and more convenient to get these things at the convenience stores only two or three blocks away. The bar will provide you with ice for a very fair price (actually they didn't even charge half the time). We booked an ocean view room - got 8A on Caribe side which was almost as close to the ocean as the ocean front rooms. We had a spectacular view (see pictures). We were literally 100 feet from the ocean. We were close enough to get a nice ocean breeze and hear the waves lull us to sleep at night without it being too loud. There was a lot of surf during our stay so I can believe how people in ocean front rooms would think of the ocean being too loud. I would definitely save the money and get an ocean view over an ocean front. We were on the bottom level of a two level bungalow. You can hear the people upstairs some, especially when they move furniture or drop something on the floor, but overall it was a not an issue. The rooms were sparsely decorated but who needs decorations on your wall when you have a view of the palm trees, blue sky and turquoise Caribbean. Otherwise rooms were exceptionally clean. There were signs in the bathrooms asking guests to not flush toilet paper. This sounded a little awkward, but we quickly came up with a system of keeping our plastic bags from the market and using them for the number two jobs, and immediately discarding them in the outside garbage cans that are between all the rooms. Pools were very small but we only used them once with the ocean being absolutely perfect to swim in. Some said they were cold. As with most pools, they were cool at first but once you were in they were fine. I would not classify them as cold. Now for the food. Breakfast was outstanding, and included with the price. Lunch was good, but not included in the price. Dinner was nothing to write home about. There was theme night each night that offered only a couple options. Dinner was also included in the price. My wife and I like to try different restaurants so we went out for most of our dinners anyway. The bar is equipped with ping pong and pool. They serve very decent drinks, but again, not included in the price. If you want to exercise on your vacation, there is no gym on site but there are two gyms within a few blocks. On modern gym to the south, and one less modern but nonetheless equipped a half block north of the OXXO store. Overall, I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to get relax and get away from it all. It is all about R&R at the Shangri La. If you're looking for a party atmosphere you need to look elsewhere. In fact, everyone at that stays at the Shangri-La would probably appreciate it. This is really a dying breed of resorts that are becoming extinct to make way for the ever popular mega resorts that stack people on the beach like cord wood. It is truly a gem, like a well kept secret. It has been rumored that the hotel is going to be leveled to make room for more condos but nobody really seems to know for sure. I asked when I booked the hotel with the Turquoise Reef Group and I was told that it will be a few years before that happens, if at all. One of the gentlemen at the front desk told me the same.

Cute resort with low-level scattered colorful palapas instead of a large building, as you can tell from the photos. To the point: the price was OK, but a bit high for the near lack of amenities. The location is very good, right on the beach and a short walk to 5th Avenue, the happening part of Playa. Rooms are clean but are starkly sparse-2 beds and a small table, no wall decorations at all. There are 2 small pools, a volleyball court (but no ball-we had to buy one), a ping pong table and 2 pool tables. Our kids passed their time playing ping pong but grumbled about not enough to do. The food was OK, not great, the usual breakfast buffet and rotating dinner meals which varied from good to OK. The service was good and our housekeeper provided extra service in response to our daily $2 tip. The beach is nice, but is very small and was really crowded with locals on the weekend. Oddly, a public beach access route divides the resort into halves. Lots of security around, mainly to keep locals and interlopers from using their beach chairs and pools and we never felt unsafe. We were asked by security guards a couple of times if we were staying at the resort on our return back from the beach but I made a point to say hi to the guards so that they would know us, and that stopped. As for restaurants, the food in town was really inexpensive, probably less than we paid for the breakfast-dinner plan, so booking a room without the meal plan may be a better option. El Fogon was great as was the Monkey Cave (I think Cange de Chagon?) that's only a couple of doors away where we had shrimp tacos to die for. Our best food, though was lunch in Tulum, where we went on 2 days to enjoy the better beach. Mezzanine was great as was Blu Tulum with a great beach and even better laid back but chic attitude. We went to one of the cenote attractions, a smaller one and it was $40 to snorkel in a cave. It was far more expensive than it should have been and a bit cheesy unless you've never been in a cave and not worth it. Unfortunately our trip was jaded by a bad drive back to the airport. After getting US $ from an ATM to avoid bringing pesos home a gas station attendant attempted to give an 8 peso to a dollar exchange rate despite the sign next to her saying it was 12.5/1 at the station. On the drive to Cancun, despite being passed repeatedly by speeding locals and carefully watching my speed to avoid this very event, we were pulled over by local police who insisted that I was speeding we would have to either pay them cash or would have to go back 30 minutes south to the police station to pay a fine. I had a card from the rental agency that was supposed to handle this but to no effect and ended up having to fork out a bribe to be allowed on our way and make our flight. A friend had the same thing happen to him the day prior and had the time to argue and avoid the payoff. These two events left a bad flavor in my mouth as to what the locals really think of the Americans who vacation there. I would certainly go back to the area to enjoy the weather and the beaches, but might go further south toward Tulum as Playa's getting built up, and just go into Playa for the entertainment.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coarsegold, California", "Title": "\u201cVery nice beach location, but at upwards of $300/night the facilities need attention.\u201d", "Author": "calmtnman", "ReviewID": "UR24821774", "Content": "This is a lovely place with a friendly staff, and I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from giving it a try, but my one word of advice is to reserve the least-cost room that is available.

You can easily walk downtown if you want to shop. The beach at the hotel is perfect. We were at Playa for a wedding and most guests stayed at the Deseo. The Deseo guests who booked suites found out that the suites were facing the street and were up until 4am due to all the noise from the clubs and the street. They also complained that at 7am the construction began. Another hotel that guests stayed at was Pueblo Escondido and those were condos, which came with a butler and private pool.

We stayed in 1C which is a beach front bungalow which we were very enamored with based on the pictures we saw on the site. And here is the perhaps new piece of info that I didn't read anywhere on trip advisor on this property...and I read about 100. The beach front bungalows are LITERALLY spitting distance from the water. Very cool in the day time but at night, what might seem charming at first (sound of waves crashing into the sand) is down right loud! If you're a light sleeper, it will keep you up. The shutters on the screens don't completely keep the wind out so it does get pretty nippy at night when you're sleeping. If I had to do it again, it would be much cheaper to stay in an ocean front room -- you would be plenty close to the water but the sound would be blocked by other buildings so it would be much more peaceful. You can get single huts (ie. not at 2 story) in the ocean front and you're maybe 30 yards further from the water....big deal. So that's my biggest advice...save money and skip the ocean front bungalow. Ours was directly next to the public passage onto the beach. No issues at all with that. Locals stayed in their spot and the security was always around to make sure if you were on the properties' chairs, you belonged there. Security was unobtrusive. As others have stated, the property ground and beach was kept up daily. Random things: We got the same scoop on the whole closing thing...no one really seems to know for sure. People do get out early to put out their orange towels. There was always room but sometimes I had to walk a whole 20 or 30 extra feet away from my hut to put them down... 2:1 from 5 to 6 pm at the bar near the lobby. They were nice enough (I read the bar tenders weren't too friendly). I wasn't looking for a new lifetime pal, just a beer, so it worked for me. There's access to computers and the net if you need it. Pools aren't heated and are cold. The pool near the breakfast place tends to have the kids if they are around but on the upside, when it's really windy yet sunny on the beach, this area tends to be less windy for sunnying Just like many people have said, breakfasts are good. Dinners are hit and miss. Some are good, some are ok. They put out the menu everyday in the lobby so you can check it out in advance. I like good food so we ate out on 5th Ave 1/2 the time 5th ave is about a 5-10 min walk as others have said. You are completely at one end and it will take you quite a while to walk the whole length. Some nice stuff, lots of junk and tourista stuff. Price negotiate like a fiend...I looked at a pair of snake boots: $750 to start and after some talking and walking away we were down to $200. It's astounding how simply walking away changes the \"best price\". I'd advise changing your money before you leave home or when you get here to pesos. The exchange rate was 13 to 1 but you don't seem to get that when you buy things. 30 cents on the dollar here and there isn't a big deal, but after a week or so, it adds up. If you want to save, convert. If you can't be bothered, you'll probably spend a bit more -- that's what we did but I wish now we had converted since I'm cheap! Attention steak lovers (ie. Ruth's Chris not Ponderosa). Best steaks on 5th ave is a restaurant called SUR Argentina...it's on 5th and about 12th. On the right side if you're coming from the hotel. Spendy but really good steaks like you'd have at home. If you come from a no smoking city, prepare to appreciate your home town. People smoke. Cool funky coffee shop just past the hotel as you're heading towards 5th ave on the left. Tucked away. Check it out Back to the hotel: rooms are plain like all have said. Bed is plenty comfy. No head board in 1C. No TV, radio, phone, clock etc. They supply one very large bottle of water per day. I was a bit concerned re. bugs from reading reports. One night we had 1 roach which I'm sure some people will read and say I am so not staying there, but that was it. Nothing else in a week. And hey, you're right on the beach. If you saw a bug at the 4S you'd right it off as bad luck and that's what we did. If you do stay in a beach front bungalow, 1C is huge. Speaking of huge, the pictures of the beach are deceiving. We were staying here predominantly b/c of the nice beach. It is nice, but is no where near as deep/wide from water's edge to bungalows as the pictures suggest...these must be old or pre storm. The beach is more than adequate, but its just not as big as the pix show. There's a massage hut if your'e interested. Dive shop is a 100 yards away. As for picking a side, Caribe v.s. Adventura...we obsessed on this for a while and just decided to have them pick for us. We were on Caribe and retrospecitvely, that was good...lots of foot traffic between the bungalows in Adventura that are close to/on the way to the bfast place. I wouldn't like the traffic. Oh yeah, the racoons. I thought when I read that, that someone was joking. Then I saw a picture on another post and figured they were serious......then I saw 2 of them in the brush while at dinner at the hotel one night. Not bothering anyone but maybe that's a good reason to go to 5th ave?! Took one tour while there: a combo of Tulum and Cobas ruins and a trip to Playa Paraiso beach. $70 per person. Left at 0840 and home by 6 or so pm. Not a bad deal if you're looking to see if the whole ruin thing is your deal. Unfortunately, you don't get to spend enough time at either ruin and the beach was insanely windy (very nice though if you're looking for a huge beach with white sand). The concierge desk has a book of many many tours you can sign up for. Tulum has a beautiful beach so it could conceivably be cheaper to take a cab back and forth and spend the day there. Lunch is included. From what we heard, the tour to Chichen is the same way: not enough time there with a a very long bus ride. There's a safe in your room too. Overall, nice place for a beach vacation. Be careful what you ask for re. \"being right on the water\". That's what we wanted and we got it big time and that proved to be awfully loud. Cheaper and just as nice in ocean front. This is not a pamper experience. If that's what you want ala 4S (and boy it is nice when you have it), you won't find that here. But if you want to hang out on a nice beach and be close to shopping and some tourista stuff, this will do the job. $80-90 one way from the airport. $50 going back.", "Date": "February 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cA heavenly getaway\u201d", "Author": "chelsea341", "ReviewID": "UR24110389", "Content": "This was my first trip to Mexico and Playa del Carmen and my only regret is why I waited so long. Shangri-La Caribe couldn't have been a more perfect choice for what my husband and I were looking for - six days of sun and total relaxation and freedom from work, commitments, TV's, and laptops. From the moment we checked in and proceeded to enter the oasis of greenery that makes up Shangri-La's grounds, I could feel the stress of my daily routine and the flight disappear. ( It usually takes me a couple of days to unwind). The helpful and friendly gentleman that took our bags set up two hammocks on our porch and we were ensconced in them reading books within 1/2 hour of our arrival. We stayed in the Pueblicito garden section which are the least expensive rooms, but very pleasant, basic yet comfortable, with a tiled bathroom and open shower and a cute porch with the hammocks and a clothesline to hang the beach towels you will be given during your stay. It was also extremely quiet with proximity to the bar, where we got to watch the inauguration, and had the chance to partake in the nightly happy hour with good bartenders and excellent, strong margaritas almost every evening. The grounds were immaculate and it was apparent that the staff worked very hard at maintaining it as so - I got up at 6AM a couple of mornings to catch the sunrise and they were already out there sweeping aroung the pool and pathways. They were always cheerful and eager to please. There are two pools which were always uncrowded, the water was a bit chilly but once you got in it was fine. Breakfast was excellent and plentiful, especially the poached eggs which I ordered a few times and were the best I've ever had, and the oatmeal. (of all things!) I read unfavorable reviews on the dinner here but we ate there every night and thought the food just fine - half the time it was buffet style with a Mexican or Caribbean theme. All the waitstaff were conscientious and quick. For lunch, we went to La Cuerva de Chango twice which is right down the road from the hotel, and found the food there inexpensive and delicious - the salsas, dipping sauces, and breads worth it alone. The beach and water were perfect - immaculate, with plenty of lounges and relatively uncrowded, with security walking around to ensure only guests were in the immediate area. Non-guests were on the beach also but nearer the shore and were not a bother anyway. I took long walks along the shore and felt Shangri-La had the nicest beachfront of all. I had asked about the rumor of the closing but I was told it probably wouldn't be happening for at least the next year or two. With all the ugly, half vacant condo developments in the area it would be a real shame to tear something down that is beautiful and seems to be working well just to build another condo complex or generic all inclusive.

Grab a cheap cab for 4 or 5 USD. The center of Playa del Carmen is very appealing, with lots of great restaurants and bars, and nice shops.

I went to this country for my honeymoon and selected Playa Del Carmen city because I and my wife needed perfect beach and sea, not night life as in Cancun. By internet I realized that sea and beach in Playa Del Carmen are better that in Cancun. Shangri-La Caribe hotel I found by tripadvisor.com and there is no one opinion from other russian tourists. It was also the first time when I used this web site to looking for residence. So there was only one way \u2013 just to believe all that I have found on this resource. And now my trip in the past and what I can to say? All my expectations are not only come true. Shangri-La Caribe become one of the best hotels in the world I have ever seen. The main reasons for this high rating are very, very beautiful hotel design both in case of interior of the rooms and exterior, comfortable and beautiful white sand beach and also are very friendly staff. Hotel is placed right on beach in the beginning of the city and at in five minutes walk from the beginning of 5th avenue \u2013 central tourist street in Playa Del Carmen with a lot of restaurants, caf\u00e9 and gift shops. The hotel buried in verdure and this is one of its advantages. The hotel is not big. We are lived at Caribe section and there is about one and half minute walk to the beach. Let me repeat, that it is very, very beautiful hotel with beautiful beach of white sand and motton blue sea with plane sand bottom. I recommend this hotel to honeymooners and other who want to go to beautiful and quiet place at Carribean sea. Unfortunaly recreation depends on people who are living in hotel with you. We had been in Shangri-La for two weeks. During first ten days hotel was half empty and it\u2019s was fine. We can always find free beach chairs, tables at restaurant, etc. But on eleven day a lot of Americans arrived and hotel became full. Americans with children different ages \u2013 from infants to teens. They were very noisy. It was irritated. Moreover there are appeared problems to find not occupied table in restaurant, place on beach or billiard table at the bar. I read that there is a little boringly in the hotel due to lack of televisions in rooms. One man suggested to take portable video players, radios, etc. But I want to say that there is no necessity for these things. However you can take notebook because there is unlimited wireless internet access in the reception hall and in the bar only for 20 pesos (about 1,5 dollars). There is no internet in rooms. Now my trip in the past and there is one more thing that I want to tell you: I realized that I\u2019m missing for my Shangri-La Hotel room and this beautiful friendly place of the world. P.S.

We had booked a partial ocean view, and were in room 3 Playa. Our room was on the ground floor of a three storey hacienda, located in the separate section of the hotel. We were close to the breakfast and dining room and also the second pool. We decided our room was probably the pick of the lot. The rooms are so well constructed, we didn\u2019t have any noise from our neighbours or those above us. Also, the way our room faced we had the most amazing beach view \u2013 I would consider it beach front as opposed to \u2018partial ocean view\u2019! Our room had a massive verandah, half was covered and the other half was open to the sun, so good for drying clothes or sun baking. We had two hammocks as well as deck chairs and a table. The room was massive \u2013 fabulous king bed that was very comfy, a couch, desk and wardrobe with safe. The bathroom had a Mexican tiled basin, toilet and shower. Yes, the room was very simple and sparse. It took us a few minutes to get used to it. But, the clean, honest decoration was so welcomed and made me feel like I was in real Mexico \u2013 not a generic hotel that could have been anywhere. The hotel has a great bar and happy hour runs from 5 to 6pm \u2013 on the dot. Sensational pina coladas with a lot of rum! Two billiard tables and two table tennis tables as well. There was a TV in the corner but I only ever saw this on twice. The hotel had a good tour desk and internet room with 4 stations. Breakfast at the hotel was good \u2013 great selection of fruit and the hot cakes were particularly good. On Sunday and Wednesday nights there was a Mexican buffet \u2013 unbelievable guacamole! And the grilled fish was great too. I would be quite happy eating their guacamole for dinner every night. When the hotel did Mexican food they did it really well \u2013 when they tried to do other cuisine (i.e. spaghetti carbonara), it wasn\u2019t so good. In the lobby they put up the menu for the coming days, so we could plan when we\u2019d go out to eat on 5th ave. I recommend \u2018Kool Fish\u2019 near the hotel, walking up toward 5th ave. It\u2019s next door to the mini mart that has been noted so many times (great variety of stock if you run out of anything!) Kool Fish did some nice seafood meals and it was a very chic setting. Locals were eating there, which is always a good sign. We didn\u2019t find the need to get a cooler from the mini mart \u2013 some bars on 5th ave have MXN$19 beers, so that was cheap enough for us! Walking to 5th avenue was easy and very safe, though the store keepers trying to get you into their shops can get a little much. I was disappointed to see not one but two Starbucks along 5th, as well as a Burger King. We booked a Chichen Itza tour and liked Chichen Itza, but would not do a tour again and would much rather fork out more money for a taxi. The tour stopped off at a souvenir shop on the way, then stopped at a restaurant for dinner (ok, but not great food) when they then brought out kids to do some dancing that then requested tips. I\u2019ve got no problem with that, but I didn\u2019t get the feeling that the kids were seeing any of the pesos being provided. On top of this, as we were leaving, the restauranteur kept reminding us that gratuities were not included in drink prices \u2013 even though his drink prices were three times the price of anywhere else. We didn\u2019t tip him after that. Chichen Itza was good \u2013 but do it by taxi and get a guide there. We did our Advance diving certification at the Cyan Ha dive shop, located on the hotel beach. The team there were very nice and took us to some great spots. If you do go diving, check to see if Tavo (\u2018the fish paparazzi\u2019) will be filming you. $50 for a DVD of your dive and it\u2019s all very well edited with great music. A fabulous keepsake. I love Playa Del Carmen and I love the Shangri La. I would definetly stay there again. After leaving the Shangri La we then had one night in Cancun before our flight and wish we hadn\u2019t done this \u2013 the noise (telephones ringing, mobile phones, tvs, cars!) from Cancun was almost deafening after the serenity of PDC.

I travel 150 nights a year and stay all over the world and found this hotel to be underwhelming at best and fraudulent at worst. What a con the website is; the pictures sucker you in and the experience is anything but a relaxing paradise. We arrived with our 2 month old baby at 2:00pm having flown from Australia (27 hours) and were told to sit in a filthy bar that had cigarettes in ash trays at every single table. We were rudely told that check-in was not until 3:00pm. When I enquired as to whether the room was ready they just pointed to the sign that said check-in was 3:0pm. They told us our room number so I walked down to see if indeed it was still being cleaned. The steam started to come out of my ears when I realised they were just making us wait for no reason at all. It was stinking hot and we were not in summer clothes having flown from cool weather at home. The rooms are a disgrace. A bed, shower and toilet is the only thing you get. We stayed in a beach front bungalow expecting a pretty impressive outfit based on the cost but the rooms are dirty, smell and the beds are like sleeping on timber slats. There is a day bed that has cigarette holes all through it and the cushion is so well worn that it may as well not be there. The hammocks have been ruined and are so uncomfortable that I sat on the wooden chair instead. The first impressions are not improved by the rest of the experience. After been very upset at the events of the first day we had a sleep and after taking care of the baby we went to the restaurant at 9:25pm (not that late for dining) but were told that the restaurant was closed. Indeed the advertised closing time is 9:30 but the all the food service had been cleared away and the staff were all sitting down eating their meal even thought there were still 5 or more tables with guests still eating..I was so mad that I walked (there is no phone in the room to call the front desk) the considerable distance to the front desk to speak to the manager. I was given the biggest brush off possible and my wife and I were forced to walk up the street in the dark to try and find somewhere to eat. The beach is nothing like the pictures on their web page. It is narrow, rocky and altogether very low grade. The water is dirty and smells strongly of sulphur (rotten egg gas). The pool is also massively over rated. It is small, old and not well kept. This resort has clearly dropped the bundle as based on other reviews it appears that they are planning on closing.

This place is not extravagant by any means but the bed and pillows are comfortable and we found it to be very charming. We LOVED the porches with hammocks. We were on the second floor so we felt totally secluded. During our stay, you would hear an occasional quite conversation but no rowdy shouting until an American wedding party arrived the day before our departure. The guests were probably 80% Europeans and 20% Americans during both my stays. Prior to the arrival of the loud wedding party, it was heavenly. We found the beach more interesting than the typical resort beach because a few locals use it for sunbathing. We enjoyed the people watching. They were beautiful and many seemed to just come out for a few hours of siesta. It is very unlike the typical American beach scene because people didn't bring chairs, sandtoys, boomboxes, umbrellas, food for an army, etc, etc, etc. They just came with a best friend or loved one, a sarong to put down as a blanket and a swim suit. The ocean was gorgeous and the sand was white and totally free of debris. You might want to bring snorkel and mask because there are lovely fish right off the beach in a rocky area. You can also rent them from the dive shop without fins for about $6 per day. The dive shop arranges snorkel trips. Ours was great. The sea was calm and like glass. The boat ride out was pleasant and the guide was enjoyable. We met several couples who were on their fourth, fifth, sixth trip to Shangri-La. That probably tells you all you need to know. We are not the type to keep going back to the same place but we will find it very hard to go to any other tropical beach as long as Shangri-La exists. I also can not say enough nice things about the staff. The same people have been there for years (one guy said 13 years) and they act like they remember you from last time.

We arrived on a Sunday and were dismayed by how crowded the beach was, but it wasn't nearly as crowded the following days. I think the weekends are very busy and the public access point to the beach is right at the location of the resort. The view out our window was gorgeous and I woudl recommend anyone staying at this resort get an ocean front room.

If you don't like what is being served, you can ask for something else and they will give it to you if possible. The service was terrific and very impressive. There are guards on the beach constantly to keep non-guests off and this is the only hotel we stayed at that had an abundant supply of beach chairs under shaded palapas.

We had celebrated our ten year anniversary at Shangri-La back in July 2005 and loved it even more on our 2008 stay. We were in the process of planning a trip to Kauai when I found out the Shangri-La Caribe was slated for demolition in June of 2009, to make way for more condominiums. We adjusted our plans and headed to Playa del Carmen. We stayed in the Aventura Section of the resort in dieciocho playa; our previous stay was in seis playa. Both are penthouse rooms; seis playa was our favorite, though dieciocho playa is also wonderful. The breeze off the sea in the Aventura Section is very enjoyable, no need for A/C at night. I have heard the rooms further in from shore do not get the cool breeze in the evenings. If you are looking for a king size bed the only way to guarantee you get one is by reserving a penthouse suite; it is well worth the extra cost. The price of the room includes breakfast and dinner, a fantastic deal when you consider the beauty of this place. We thought with the closing of the resort in 2009 the staff might not be as attentive, but the service was as professional as we remembered. Rueben was an exceptional waiter who welcomed us every evening and took care of our every need. On our last night he provided us with an amazing table decorated with flowers shells and linen backed chairs. Ask for Rueben you will not be disappointed. Dinners at La Loma are very good; I would not say many places in Playa are great, but the dinners offer a variety of entrees, with a buffet thrown in every now and then (Mexican Fiesta Night was a lot of fun). The mosquito\u2019s bit our legs the first night, but a little bug spray (Family Off) kept the little guys at bay the rest of our stay. Breakfast includes a buffet with fresh fruits, juices, pastries, meats, in addition to the made to order egg entrees. We had dinner in town at Playasia one night. Very romantic atmosphere (cenote runs right through the middle of the restaurant) with tables set up in tree house like arrangements. Food was very good food. The beach at Shangri-La is still the best and one of the biggest in Playa. The chairs are spread out with your own private palapas, they don\u2019t cram beach chairs 20 deep like most all the resorts we passed on the beach. Security keeps vendors from coming up constantly, but you can buy a cup of fresh fruit from a vendor if you just give them a nod. This place is rustic; no phones or TV\u2019s in the rooms and that is the appeal of the resort. It is not an all inclusive filled with tons of people and that is the reason why we love it. You will find a very international guest list; many of the guests are from Europe in addition to a good number of Americans. If you like the all inclusive resorts this is not the place, but if you want a truly unique and relaxing vacation this is it. The town has crept northward just steps away from the resort. I have talked to people who remember Shangri-La being surrounded by jungle with no condos in sight. Speaking of condos, it is hard to imagine that this place will be bull dozed to make way for more of the awful looking condos that have taken over the coastline of Playa, especially to the north. A little bit of Lagniappe: There are several convenience stores up the road, Calle 38, but the one to hit is Super \u201cEl Campeon\u201d.

With my husband's support, I was ready to leave to find a new hotel, but the front desk worked with us, until they finally satisfied us by moving us to a palapa closer to the ocean, one that got fresh air and was not musty at all.

We were never sure if we were bit by virtually invisible bugs in our room, or by bugs somewhere else, but I was definitely bitten on my side many times. These bites were tiny, but numerous. All the staff at the hotel was super friendly. The food was great. And we did learn that the Marriot bought the proprerty and the one neighboring and will be tearing it down to built a new one of their own in 2009. Bummer.

There are two pools which are fairly basic, but they seemed to be more than adequate for families with young children.

But we headed down a few days early to get some extra vacation time, and were there a total of five days. I can't even begin to describe how bummed we were when we returned on Sunday. This hotel is everything the previous reviewers have advertised it to be. Quaint, romantic, well laid out, clean, full of amenities, etc. etc. etc. The room rates are insanely affordable, especially given that they include breakfast and dinner. We figured it'd be the standard fare continental breakfast, and a dinner buffet with cold refried beans, dried-up tortillas and chewy fajita meat. WRONG WRONG WRONG! The breakfast had everything you could want -- from pastries, fruits and yogurt, to made-to-order french toast, pancakes, eggs and omelettes! And the dinners were just as good -- each night featured some sort of fresh seafood, as well as great tasting chicken, beef and vegetarian dishes. As one who likes to eat, I was anything but disappointed. We stayed in the Caribe section of the resort and had our own single-story bungalow that was maybe a 30-meter walk to the beach. The room was very clean and well decorated. Yes, the beds are hard compared to what we Americans are used to, but they are hard like a Tempurpedic \"memory foam\" mattress and not stiff like a board. I personally loved them. The air conditioning worked like a charm for the few times our ceiling fan wasn't enough to cool us. What else...the pool areas (2) are both very cute and provide a nice freshwater alternative from the beach and warm waters of the Gulf. It was very windy on two of the days, but the interior pool area was so well sheltered by the tall palm trees and bugalow rooms that we were able to spend our entire day outdoors with zero wind. SO NICE! The hotel also has an on-site dive shop, which is heaven if you are a scuba diver (or snorkler). I don't think I've ever been able to stroll 10 meters out of my hotel room door, make a reservation for a dive, and then wade out straight out into the water to board the boat! No long drives to some far away pier, no annoying long boat ride to a far away scuba site. It really could not have been more convenient and the dive staff was SO incredibly friendly. Finally, we loved the actual location of the hotel within Playa. As I'm sure you know, Playa is not nearly as developed as its neighbor to the north. But there are those who think that even its famed 5th Avenue is already overdeveloped (e.g. there are now TWO Starbucks locations). Fair enough. But the best part about the Shangri-La is that it's a few blocks away from the very northern point of the 5th Avenue strip. So you have the total peace and isolation of this amazing resort, and yet you're only a 10min walk to the main commercial strip of Playa if you want to do any shopping, go out to bars, etc. Okay, I've already written 10x what I intended. Can you tell I love this place?!! I would go back tomorrow if I could take the time off work again. On a final, sad note, I too have heard that the hotel was sold recently and will be closing in 2009. So all I can say is get there while you can!

The only minor problem was the beds are rather hard for this American. As the pictures show, all bungalows had hammocks that were perfect for the afternoon siesta! The meals were really good and a wide variety. The pools rarely had more than 4 poeple in them. I always could find a chair at the beach, and our section was not very crowded. The hotel is located in a great area with a convenience store nearby and the popular 5th Ave about 3 blocks away. Apparently the Marriot organization has bought the property and it will close in April 2009. Such a shame......small intimate properties like this are rare in Playa anymore.

The hotel is located on a great stretch of beach where you can walk for long distances in either direction. We had a room in the Pueblito section (garden view) in a two-unit casita. The rooms are fairly spare. No TV, no phone, no radio not even a clock and if you need one, be aware there are no hair dryers. That said, the room was clean and functional. Lots of closet space, a king size bed, good bathroom counter space with an open shower on one side and water closet on the other. Good air conditioning and ceiling fan. Screens on all the windows with little inside shutters you could open or close as you wish. All the rooms feature a balcony with a pair of hammocks that were great for lounging. The rooms have a safe, but be aware, while heavy it is not attached to the wall, however, we did not have any concerns regarding security. Our room was a one-minute walk to the beach, which features loungers and a group of palapas. We secured a palapa and pair of chairs and small table each day. I was usually at the beach by 8:30 - 9:00 and had no problems. There are two small pools on the property. We did the pool only one day when the weather was cool and windy at the beach but much warmer a few steps inland at the pool. Shangri La is small (85 rooms) and is not the place to go if you are looking for a wild party scene. It is very laid back and relatively quiet. There is a small bar with happy hour 2 for 1 from 5:00 \u2013 6:00 each day and that is when the bar is the busiest. At the bar there is a game room under a large palapa with a couple of pool tables and ping-pong tables. My fianc\u00e9 and played pool a couple of nights around 9:00 or 10:00 and there might have been one or two other couples around at the bar--very quiet. The game room also has Wi-Fi. The location of Shangri La was excellent. A one block walk away from the water puts you at the north end of the main street (Fifth Ave). On the corner is a small market where we picked up soda and beer. The gift shop at the hotel is very minimal and doesn\u2019t sell sodas or much in the line of snacks. From that corner it was a relatively short walk to the main shopping, dining, nightlife area on Fifth Ave. We a walked it every day and typically ate somewhere differently each night. We usually took a cab back to he hotel and from the main square the price varied between $3 \u2013 $5 for a cab ride back. Shangri La is modified AI with breakfast and dinner included. Can\u2019t say much about the dinners cause we never ate there. Breakfast was fine. There was a buffet with fruits, breads, cereal etc and hash browns and sausage each day and there was also a menu where you could get eggs cooked to order or pancakes, French toast etc. The staff at Shangri La was very friendly and very hard working. The breakfast crew was large and really hustled to make sure everyone was taken care of. The bar staff worked really hard at happy hour to make sure everyone was waited on quickly. Bottom line is this is a great place if you are looking for quiet and relaxing. Not so good if you want a party scene or want to be in the middle of the action. That said it isn\u2019t difficulty to find excitement in the Fifth Avenue area, which is really a short distance away.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location-stops there\u201d", "Author": "Liza9999", "ReviewID": "UR15106066", "Content": "Great location,such a shame.

We were in a beachfront casita, #34 Playa. It was larger than the beachfront one we had 3 years ago in the Caribe section. Even though the hotel will be replaced after the 2009 season (so we were told at check-in when we inquired, having read on Trip Advisor that it had been sold), everyone who worked there was very pleasant. The beach was much wider than in 2005, desite Hurricane Wilma and last year's storm which landed on Cozumel. So we were very happy that the resort was in excellent condition. One thing that is less pleasing now, however, is the fact that the beach is quite crowded with those non hotel guests who enter this public beach by way of the road which serves as a beach access. Whereas before the land behind the hotel was undeveloped, now it has several new condos. People camped right in front of our casita on more than one occasion, and used the shady spots under the palms and palapas. When told to move by the security, they moved only a foot ot two forward. The food was as good as ever. We liked the 3 buffet nights. There is so much to choose from, and most items are very good. I would describe it as just plain tasty, not gourmet. The servers are very polite and seem happy with their jobs. I understand from a guest who has been returning for 17 years, that many of them have worked there for that length of time. The buffet breakfast is wonderful because the eggs and breakfast meats are all cooked to order, and the servers take the order. The choices include all kinds of egg dishes, as well as some Mexican specialties. No waiting in the omelet line while everything else gets cold at this hotel!

Not just because we were going from 85 degrees back to 25 degrees, but because the hotel is such a relaxing place. This appears to be the only place left on the beach that's not a huge resort. The rooms are spread out in small thatch roof villas connected by sandy paths. We had an ocean view room, just steps back from the ocean front. Great being so close we could just pop up to the room from the beach to pee! The first room we were given had no view at all and 2 double beds. We talked to the desk, and they said they couldn't move us until after the second night. The place was booked solid, so we understand it was difficult to move us, but it was worth the wait-the room we moved into had a comfortable king bed, a fantastic view, great A/C, deck, hammocks, and privacy. The beach is beautiful and well supplied with palapas and lounge chairs. It is a public beach, and it got pretty crowded with locals on Sat and Sun, but there was never a shortage of space as 3 security guards made sure said palapas and chairs were only occupied by guests. On the weekdays, the beach was lively, but not crowded. Around lunchtime, a waiter goes around the beach taking orders for food and drinks which are delivered quickly. We brought a soft sided cooler and took a daily walk to the \"mini-super\" about 2 blocks away to stock up on water, ice and beers , thus keeping our bar tabs down. There are 2 pools which usually had lots of kids around, so we pretty much stuck to the beach. Breakfast and dinner are included, and both were good. Breakfast has a great spread of fresh fruit, pastries, cereals and fresh squeezed juices, plus you can order eggs any way imaginable, pancakes, french toast, etc. Fill up and you can just have a light lunch (not included, but we usually just got an order of fries). Dinner is included, and the food was excellent. Not a buffet, except Mexican night, and includes soup, app, entree and dessert. The menu, which changes daily, is posted at the front desk. We don't eat beef, pork or chicken and there were a few days we looked at the menu ahead of time and saw we wouldn't have options, but usually there is an excellent fish option. There are lots of places easily within walking distance if you don't care to eat at the resort, as you are only a few blocks from 5th. The best, however, is not even that far. La Cueva de Changa is just up Calle 38. Amazing food in a garden setting. Service is slow, but relax, you're on vacation.

We were traveling with our 10-month-old son to a tropical destination for the first time and were more than a bit nervous about the dinking water - bottle washing - formula storage - etc. We had a wonderful time. I will not repeat what others said below about the beauty of the site (amazing), the quality of the food ( very good), etc. I thought the staff was very nice, especially the restaurant staff who constantly played with baby while working really hard. The bartenders: not super friendly but doing their jobs. The reception: upon checking the dark-haired lady was not all that friendly either, but she warmed up every other time I talked to her after that. I guess we can't be in a great mood all the time. There were many families with young children. They have high chairs and cribs. We had to call the pediatrician ( hotel visit) on the 3rd day, as each morning baby woke up with more red dots on his face and hands, fearing it was chicken pox or the like. Must have been a bug in the crib, which we exchanged after the $80 bill of the quite useless doctor, who appeared to be right out of high school and completely baffled as to what happened to baby. He had a stethoscope and nothing else ( no thermometer, stick to look in mouth, or \"thing\" to look inside ears, nothing!) so since baby was fine, we ended up finding it quite comical. The dots cleared up slowly after swapping the crib and baby was fine. Bugs - yes, but only around baby's food, not randomly crawling around. Having to do everything out of a sink with no counter space, not spilling anything was a bit of a challenge, so we did see ants ( small and medium size) and then a few mosquitoes, which I suspect were coming out of the shower drain? So take mosquito repellent, better safe than sorry, but nothing to be scared of. For cheap food and drinks: buy them up the street. There is a small store one block up and a bigger store ( like a 7-eleven type store) called OxxO that sells styrofoam coolers ( the the left above a fridge machine when you get in - not very visible) and ice for 25 pesos and has an ATM. Everyone takes dollars but gives change in pesos. For lunch -- ate in town once ( pricey), once up the street at cueva del chango (very good, cheap and original place), and at the hotel restaurant 3 times ( once there, once took it to go back to the beach and once a waiter walked by and gave us a menu right on the beach), once in cozumel. Oh yeah, we took the ferry to Cozumel. Since the walk to the ferry is a good 45 minutes power trot, we took a cab - about $5USD - very cheap. Ferry was $14USD round-trip/person, about 35 minutes trip. Cozumel was fine but with baby we couldn't do what we would have normally done: rent scooter, go on snorkeling trip, etc. but it was still fun. They have hair dryers at the lobby desk on demand. The first few days were very windy with big waves and not as warm as expected - we usually go at the end of May. The water in pool was chilly and the ocean was definitely refreshing. The wind slowed down and then the weather was just perfect. We had a tiny bit of rain here and there, usually early morning but not enough to see if you get up past 7am. People got up early. Of course, so did we. Breakfast starts at 7:30am but they had coffee machines at the bar and by the restaurant much earlier. People do keep their chairs really early so beware. There were always some available but you had to hunt them down. Try by the pool by the breakfast restaurant, there seemed to be more availability there. I didn't reserve our seats at first since I am kind of against that. One day we got to the beach at 8am and all the 100 chairs had towels on them but only about 15 people were there. Some people reserve chairs all day long but only show up for about an hour per day, which I think is not right. That day, I found 2 empty chairs and moved over 2 \"reserved\" chairs so we could use their palapa for shade. Sorry, but with baby, shade was a \"must\". They showed up in the afternoon and did not say anything. After that, I, too, started \"reserving\" our spot before breakfast, but didn't feel so bad because we did stay there all day long and actually used them. By mid-afternoon, many people seemed \"done\" with the beach. The sun would go down on the beach by 4:30pm, then most seemed to go shower or relax in the hammocks ( which were great!) and at 5pm it was time for cheap and potent margaritas for happy hour. The wait until 7pm sometime seemed long since it was dark by 6pm, which also marked the end of happy hour :-) My husband got a massage and seemed satisfied. We brought our snorkeling gear, not too much to see ( compared to other places like Akumal or Belize) but still fun if waves allow, just head for the dark patches (reef). People watching was great.

Some of the other beachfront units were too close to the water and the traffic of the pedestrians, runners, and families who plunk down on the beach. We had 2 hammocks on the porch, as I think all of the units had. There was a wonderful breeze on the beach, so we never had to use our air conditioning. Away from the beach it was hot though, so I'd guess units not on the beach did use the A.C. My husband and I thought the food was good. Breakfast (included) was a beautiful fruit buffet, 2 types of fresh juice, sausages, hash browns, breads, teas, coffee, and your choice of omelets, eggs, french toast, pancakes and mexican breakfasts as well. The lunches (not included) were OK. The Mexican food is real Mexican food - it is not Tex-Mex or something you'd find at Chipotle or Chile's. So it may not look like you expect it too. This was the way we found it to be on or off the resort. We also thought the dinners (included) were fine. The grilled fish was especially good. Some nights there was a buffet and some nights 2-3 choices (i.e. pastas, pork, fish). I thought the drink prices were fine ($3-4 US) for a beer, about $4-5 US for a cocktail. Happy Hour with 2 for 1 on most drinks from 5-6. The location was great, at the north end of Playa, right on the beach. To walk to town on the beach was about 20-25 minutes and about a 10-15 minute walk on the city streets. It's about 3 blocks to 5th avenue, the main street, which is a fun pedestrian walkway. We walked back through town by ourselves at night to the hotel and felt quite safe. The down side -- the staff. We finally found a bartender with personality, after about 5 days. The rest of them just weren't real friendly, even with tips. Wendy at the front desk was downright rude, on a couple of occasions. We asked the female concierge if she could recommend a few good restaurants in town. Her reply: \"I don't know, I never go down there.\" Really! We are saddened that it's going to close. We were told it was closing in April 2009. We would love to go back and spend time at this beautiful resort. Except for the staff, it was a slice of heaven and I'd highly recommend it, especially if you like laid back, small resorts. Although there must have been several hundred people there, we never saw many people, at the pools, at the meals. I guess that's the beauty of the layout. We didn't have any problems with the orange beach towels, by the way. We'd leave ours out on the beach lounge chairs to hold our spot all day and they'd always be there when we got back.

I would suggest that if you arrive several hours before check in and you plan to sit on the lounge chairs you should ask at check in for your orange towels. If not you can still sunbath but just have to stay off the lounge chairs. Beach - Awesome beach, white sand and well maintained, one important thing you should know that it is a public beach. If you revert back to the hotel website take note of the map plan of the resort, there is a gap between the Caribe and Adventura section. This is actually a road that ends at the beach giving public access; it really wasn't a problem you just have to keep in mind that there will be a local presence especially on the weekends. We noted a group of young adults who came everyday at the same time and situated themselves between the beach line and the resort lounge chairs. I had no issues with this until our last day (Friday) when they showed up earlier than usual. There was one girl who basically talked non stop from 10am to 4pm, I didn't mind at first, but she became more annoying as time went on and because it was our last day I wanted to spend as much time on the beach as possible. After a borderline nervous breakdown my wife and I couldn't take it anymore and left for the pool for the last few hours of sun. Aside from that one day, I would say that our overall impression of the beach was a perfect 10! Food - Breakfast was great with a wide variety of choices, the lunch menu was pretty reasonably priced and the food was good. With regards to dinner I would say overall that it was satisfactory, our first meal (Sat) was only two choices, chicken or steak. It was okay but I was worried about the limited choices offered, however going forward the meal selection improved and we were not disappointed. We ate diner at the resort every night except twice when we strolled down 5th Ave for something different. Please be reminded that all drinks and lunches are not included and must be paid for, you could set up a \"tab\" at check in or pay as you go, I elected to pay as I go. The best way to go if you are a beer drinker is buy a styrofoam cooler for your room, fill it with ice and store bought beer. There were quite a few people who did this, this would work especially well if you are staying in either the ocean view or beach front papalas. FYI, it is rare for the waiter to come and serve you on the beach, this happened only once from us during our stay. Depending on which part of the beach you are situated on, it could be long walk to the bar. Rooms - our room was very clean and we had no issues or complaints about anything, we never used the AC because of the cool ocean breeze at night along with the ceiling fan keep the room at a comfortable temperature. As noted on their website, there are no phones or TV's in the rooms, which created a very quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Facilities - This resort does not provide any evening entertainment or shows, there is a main bar with a lounge consisting of two ping pong tables and two pool tables. If you are looking for something low key and quiet this is the place for you. The main strip, 5th Ave is a 10min walk away, it is pretty dark from the hotel up to 5th Ave, the street lights were not work however it was only a short distance (100m) and perfectly safe, there are always people around. This resort provided the perfect relaxing vacation were looking for, it was simply amazing. If you have read previous reviews there were rumors stating that the hotel will be closing. We inquired and found that this was true, as to when the answer was not definite. I hope it stays around for a least another year so we could visit it one more time, if you have chance to stay at this resort I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed. If you wish to stay in the beach front or ocean view units, you will need to book well in advance.

The reviews are correct in that dinner is marginal, but who stays and eats dinner at the resort anyway? Breakfast was fantastic and a lunch of guacamole and beers will tide you over until you head out for the evening. If you want a sanitized, Americanized, boring experience than don't stay here. However, if you want beautiful ambience and an excellent Mexican (Read: Not an American experience in Mexico) experience than stay here. I only wish it wasn't supposedly being closed down.

The hotel itself is very pretty and its set up is ideal with sweet bungalows on the beachfront and around the pool. The beach front is extremely pretty as can be seen by our photos. Having walked up and down the beach I would have to say the Shangri-la Caribe is by far the prettiest hotel on the Playa del Carmen stretch as it is right at the end out of the way and taken back off of the beach so not as many people walk past. The one main problem we did have with this hotel was the food. To start with Breakfast was amazing with a huge choice of hot and cold, Mexican and traditional dishes which was fantastic as it gave you a great start to the day. HOWEVER, supper on the other hand was an absolute joke! The first night we went to the dining room, we were taken to our seat and pointed in the direction of the buffet, which is when it all went wrong. It was by far the most horrendous looking and minimalist buffet I have ever seen. The reason I say looked is because there was not a chance in hell I could ever have eaten it! My boyfriend, being a little more daring than myself tried some, obviously not knowing what is was as it all looked the same in different dishes, and felt quite sick. Sadly it did not end there! I then decided to skip the main course and try a dessert thinking how could they go wrong with that, to my disappointment though they had cleared away the desserts even though it was 8.30!!! From the time of entering and leaving the restaurant we had been there a total of 10 minutes \u2013 very disappointing especially as all our suppers were included and we could not eat there. We tried the restaurant once more whilst we stayed there and that lasted even less time, we walked in saw two plates with cling film over and were told that\u2019s what we were expected to eat \u2013 trust me that was not going to happen EVER again! Overall our stay here was relatively pleasant but we were glad to be leaving after the 5 nights. In this hotel you get what you pay for and in this case the hotel is relatively cheap!

The service was fantastic - so friendly and efficient. The front desk and the concierge will help you out with anything - just ask and they will either arrange it themselves or make it as easy as possible. They handled all our dry cleaning for 2 weeks, posted our postcards, organised our snorkelling trips, ran around for an hour getting the spa jets working in the main pool just for us, and generally were wonderful. The rooms are quite basic but very clean - the maid even cleans all the windows every day so that your view of the Caribbean is perfect. They provide big orange beach towels and fresh bottled water each morning. The bathroom is shower only and very small. We stayed in an ocean view room upstairs in the Caribe section. The location is just right - a few blocks from the shops and busier beach bars, so that you can have absolute peace and quiet, or just wander up the beach for 10 mins for a cocktail. When it's really hot it's worth asking the desk to call you a taxi to go into town. The 2 pools are lovely, and the all day Bar is cheap and fun. Internet is also cheap and a fast connection. But the best thing about the Shangri-la is the food. We stayed at another resort (much more expensive) after it, and were expecting the same quality, but were sadly disappointed. This made us realise how special the food is at the Shangri-la. Breakfast and dinner are included in the room tariff, and they are not set servings, but as much as you want. The dinner menu changed every night and it was so good we couldn't wait to see what was next. There were even free tequila shots one night, and the desserts were awesome.

All I could think about on the trip home was posting my review to warn travelers about this place. I booked the hotel through their website and reserved a king-sized bed for three nights. The day prior to the trip, I called the hotel to arrange transportation from the airport. I spoke to the receptionist who confirmed our stay with them and asked me for the flight arrival time. She told me a driver would be there waiting by the cab station with my name on a sign. When we arrived to Mexico, we went straight outside (on time) to the cab area and there was no sign. I asked the main guy who seemed to be in charge about the hotel driver and he said he had not seen them. So I called the hotel and spoke to the female manager who told me they didn't send transportation because I did not give them my flight number. I told her I wasn't asked that information and she told me that the receptionist who took my other information was new and basically it was my problem that I should have known what to tell her. So we took a cab for what should have only been $50 per the hotel turned out to be $85. When we arrived at the hotel, we went to the lobby\u2019s front desk and there was lone staffer talking to another guest. This went on for awhile. We stood there waiting patiently with our luggage. The guest finally walked away and the man at the front desk then got on the phone. And we continued to wait. I could see a woman sitting at a desk in an office who never looked up to help (my guess was this was the rude person I spoke to on the phone earlier). My patience ran thin as he never acknowledged us so I finally loudly requested that we wanted to check in. He got off the phone and asked me my name. Hardly the greeting I expected from a hotel that had been so raved about. Once he checked us in, we asked to speak to the manager about the cab incident. He leaned into that office where the woman was and she would not come out. I could still see her through the window and see her telling him no. I demanded to speak to her face to face and she finally trudged out. She was just as rude in person as on the phone. I could see this was going nowhere, I was tired and frustrated so we were taken to our rooms by a very nice, smiling and helpful bellman \"Bolley\" (sic). I had yet to realize this would be the only delightful thing at the hotel. We got to our room and there were two doubles instead of the king as I reserved. I wasn't in the mood to walk back and deal with that staff so we decided to stay there that night. We went to the restaurant a little later for dinner and there was the female manager, in the line at the buffet. I thought it humorous she was too busy to greet customers but not too busy to eat. In fact, every time we ate she was always there eating as well. The food was so-so. The next morning we went to the office and inquired about the bed arrangement. The guy at the desk told me there were only 3 King beds at the resort and they were all taken. He even pulled out a map to show me exactly where those unavailable bungalows were located (strange). I continued to express my disappointment so the man went back to that see-through office to speak to the same woman and came back and \u201cwa-la\u201d there was a bungalow available after all. Beware of what you ask for. We were moved across the entire resort and put in a bungalow in the back directly across from a new resort being built which = CONSTRUCTION. It dawned on me since there were hardly any other guests in our area that they weren't using these because of the continuous noise. They should have made us aware of the situation and let us decide. ANYWAYS. The final night we wanted to check in at the airport and print our boarding passes for the flight home. The girl at the desk told us that the \"internet was closed until 9am\". ??? So we had to go into town to use an internet cafe. Finally, on the morning of check out, I asked the same front desk clerk for our bill. He never asked me how our trip was or anything. But this is the same guy who couldn't even mutter a \"welcome\" when we got there so I really wasn't surprised. He handed me my bill so I began to intently look over it as I wasn't about to put my trust in a hotel that doesn't have integrity. The man was rushing me to sign it (even though we were the only ones in the lobby). I told him I was looking over it and he turned away and made a ridiculous face (rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue). I guess he didn\u2019t think I saw him but I called him out on it and he acted like \"no habla ingles\". Over all the place is clean, pretty and the food average. The staff is HORRIBLE except for the bellman-Bolley (who hooked us up with a cab on the way out for only $40). They should put \"Bolley\" (sic) in charge of guest services, stat. In fact, they should put him in charge of the entire place. We will NEVER go back.

Traveled with my family and my sister-in-law and her daughter. After arriving in Cancun and renting a car, drove down in about 45 minutes to Playa. Plenty of parking at Shangri-La although there is a new condo/hotel being built across the street which will likely see more people and cars. Check-in was fine, they had our reservations. We were placed in 32B and 33B in the Caribe section. They were on the second floor and were connected which was nice for our family. Wasnt able to get beach front rooms as hotel was full our first few nights. My room had two queen beds and a small desk. Very humid this time of the year but the ac and fan worked. However, with the playa roofs (there were spots where you could see the outside), the rooms still felt humid. Bathroom has a shower only and water pressure was ok. No TV or phone which is part of the charm. Each room had a nice deck with hammocks which we really enjoyed. We were steps away from the Caribe pool and the beach. Enjoyed sitting in the hammock and reading my book. One of the best parts of the hotel. I was disappointed to find mice droppings on the floor when we first checked in. Not a positive start. Insects were of course plentiful (saw a few large roaches and plenty of ants in our room) but not unexpected. Housekeeping did a nice job of cleaning the room every day, changing the towels and leaving a bottle of water. Only 25 pesos if you wanted to buy bottled water. By the way, there is no noise insulation for the rooms. On our 1st night, a wedding group decided to party into the late hours after the bar closed. You hear everything so we left the ac on that night. The hotel was quiet after that large group left. As others mentioned, bkfst and dinner are included in the price. Bkfast was quite good with a decent selection. Eggs made to order and lots of fresh fruit. Dinner was just ok. We ended up going into Playa for dinner our last two nights. Staff in both dining rooms were great. We did make sure to leave a tip after each meal. There are two swimming pools. Although small to swim in, both have small sections for little kids. We used both and the kids enjoyed themselves. The beach is just lovely. There were always enough chairs and umbrellas. You are given orange beach towels when you first check-in and you can replace them for fresh ones at any time. The beach is public so you do see quite a few locals enjoying themselves on the beach (especially on Sunday). Swimming was great, with snorkeling gear, you could see fish a few feet out during low tide. Water was clear and calm for the most part. Most people we met at the hotel were European with a few other American. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Very laid back attitude here. There is wi-fi in the lobby and we were close enough that I was able to get a weak connection from my room. Otherwise they do have 3 computers for you to access email, etc. Did not use the dive center as didnt have time but would imagine diving would be wonderful here. Did get a massage which was quite good and relatively inexpensive. Although outdoors, the cool seabreeze was relaxing. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. If you are looking for a laid back, relaxing resort, this is a good choice although I would try to get a beach front room. Not luxurious but comfortable. Would have given a higher rating if not for the noise and the mice droppings.

I've been to Mexico before, but it was my first time to stay in the Yucatan Peninsula. I had a friend that recommended Playa, and through lots of research found Shangri-La Caribe. I've stayed in many hotels around the world and typically look for something that blends luxury with the local culture. I'm not the type to stay at an \"all inclusive\" that enialates every bit of the local culture that you wonder why you even went to another country. When I booked I was concerned about the weather reports saying that this time of the year was full of rain and thunderstorms. Throughout our entire stay - the last week of June to first week of July - it was nice and sunny. It must have rained once that entire week which cooled off everything nicely. I must say that this hotel was exactly what I was looking for. We stayed at one of the cabanas in the Caribe side which was literally no more that 30 feet from the beach. I recommend booking early to get one of these cabanas. You may spend a little bit more, but its definitely worth it. The staff was very courteous and friendly from beginning to end. The concierge knew exactly what we were looking for and arranged our entire week for us. The wait staff service varied a little, but eventually you knew the ones that had worked there for awhile and provided that extra service that made your trip memorable. Although not required, I recommend tipping whenever possible - $1/tip goes a long way. The bartender was always ready to serve you a drink so don't miss Happy Hour! Our accomodations included breakfast and dinner. Definitely do not skip breakfast since this included plenty of local fruits, juice, bread, and eggs cooked the way you like. I disgree with what other people wrote about the dinners here. It may not be the best Mexican food in town, but it also isn't the worse. Definitely try not to skip Mexican BBQ night. However if you have a short stay, then I would go to Quinta Avenida where you will find plenty of really good Mexican food for that romantic dinner. Other useful tips: 1. Take the bus from the Cancun airport to Playa Del Carmen. You can take a free shuttle (not Taxi) to Terminal 2 and catch the bus from there. 2. The price from Quinta Avenida (bus terminal) to the hotel is 30 pesos/$3 dollars. A tip of 10 pesos/$1 is plenty so bring plenty of $1 bills! 3. Yes, bring that small cooler to put drinks in. You can get ice either from the bartender, or from the corner convenient store right outside the hotel. 4. Rent a car and drive to the ruins as early as possible to beat the heat and the hoards of tourist buses. 5. Take the ferry and go to Cozumel. Rent mopeds and get as far away from the city center as possible. Go snorkeling at Punta Sur - worth the $10/entry fee. 6. Learn a little \"conversational\" Spanish before you go since this will go a long way at Playa.

Even the touristic center of Playa del Carmen is still a great place to be. You'll find some vendors trying to sell you stuff more active but they don't offend you, they stay relaxed. The center is really good taken care of, it's clean, haven't seen junkies and the Mexican people are pure friendly! We did a Whale shark trip one day, wich was truely fantastic.

The beach at the resort is perfect. It's never hard to get a chair and it stays pretty quiet. The water is extremely blue and very warm.

We stayed at the Shangri-la from June 16-20 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a totally relaxing low key getaway. It is a lush, beautifully landscaped \"village\" with adorable little bungalows on a pristine beach. Since we had no complaints, our contact with the front desk was limited but always positive. When we made our reservation we were told there were no ocean view rooms available but when asked for one at check in, we were given one right away. The view was gorgeous and seconds from the beach. We were in 14A and would request the same room next year. We loved the pathways to the bungalows and our pretty front porch and relaxing hammocks were awesome. Our room was delightful. It was pleasantly cool , clean, bright and airy with comfortable beds and pillows. Each morning it was throughly cleaned. All the wait staff were helpful and friendly. The other guests we talked to were definitely as happy with the place as we were. We didn't see bugs but by the last day one of us had lots of little bites that were very itchy and bought Calamine lotion in the gift shop. We wrote down to remember lotion next year. Both the restaurants were charming and the servous was excellent. There was a variety of food and we found breakfast especially delicous. The Mexican buffet one evening was fantastic. The second day we went into town for dinner and both agreed, why bother paying for a dinner in town when we could have a better dinner free at \"home\". \"Happy hour\" was one of our favorite times of the day. The bar was low key and relaxing. We had terrific 2 for 1 Pina Colada's and Mojitos every afternoon. There was not a momment when we were not completely relaxed. The massage was so lovely and we found the price very reasonable. It was awesome to drift back to our hammocks after the massage was over. Each day we sat on comfortable beach chairs with big orange beach towels that could be exchanged for fresh ones any time. The pretty palapas umbrellas allowed you to be in the sun or the shade all day. Drinks and lunch could be ordered on the beach and brought to you. We had a shrimp cerviche which was to die for. We only had lunch one day because we were so full from breakfast. The hotel had nicely dressed security men walking on the beach who made us feel very safe. In my opinion, anyone who was not happy with the beach, would not be happy anywhere. If you are looking for a place with room entertainment, hot night clubs, and numerous restaurants to choose from, this is not the place for you. But for us, a plush atmosphere, good food and drinks, clean airy rooms, friendly staff, refreshing swimming pools, comfortable places to in sit enjoying the breeze and an absolutely fabulous beach- you can't go wrong.

Last time we were in 33P and had no problems at all. That's one of the reasons we returned this year. However, the only real problem we had was with bugs in the room. I read another person's review and realized that we had the same room - 34P. I wasn't going to write a review this time around, but after realizing that we both had the same room and the same problem, I thought I would mention it to anyone going to Shangri-La and requesting a beachfront bungalow. Don't get me wrong - this problem didn't upset me as much as it did the other reviewer. Once we alerted them about the bug problem, they immediately sent two men over to spray and change the linens on both beds. We still had bugs on the wall behind the bed from time to time, but it wasn't anything that I couldn't handle with a little of my own bug repellant. The bugs were tiny, tiny ants (I think). I didn't get bit by any, only mosquitos at night when we were outside. One thing you have to remember when you stay in a beachfront bungalow (or any with a thatched roof) at Shangri-La or anywhere in Mexico - there will be bugs. Let me stress one thing - I hate bugs. I pay a lot of money at home to an exterminator every two weeks so that I don't see any in my house. But when I'm in Mexico, I expect that I will see bugs. It's just different and you have to be prepared for it. I checked the beds every night and we never had any more ants in them. Everything else was perfect, just as before.

Here are our thoughts: Check-In/Front Desk: We took the hotel airport shuttle service and the shuttle was on time and hassle-free round-trip. We had no problems at check in and Paulina at the reception was very welcoming and friendly even though we arrived at 10pm! Later, she gladly helped us out with shopping suggestions on 5th Ave when we asked her. However, the concierge was a different story! She was hardly ever there and when she was, she seemed too bored to answer your questions. We did go on one tour of the ruins in Tulum and Coba arranged through her and while the ruins were beautiful, our guide was really bad!! He was least concerned about his tour group or what they wanted. Beach: The beach is GORGEOUS!!! :-) It is all white sand and turquoise waters, just like a postcard! It isn\u2019t a private hotel beach but there is plenty of security and it is very safe. And yes, you will see some topless sun bathers\u2026.. Room: We were in 26C , a garden view cottage in the Caribe section, which was a cozy corner cottage , just 10 steps from the beach! It was a single level cottage and I liked the fact that we didn\u2019t have upstairs/downstairs neighbors! We could hear and partially see the ocean from our cottage and slept with our windows open at night. There are protective mesh coverings on all windows and we didn\u2019t have any issues with bugs in the room. We did see mosquitoes a couple of nights but it was nothing that OFF spray couldn\u2019t handle. Just make sure that your front door is closed at all times. I was a little concerned before I went that the air-conditioning may not be cool enough (I get warm real quick) but the air conditioning worked perfectly! The beds and linens are very comfortable! And the cottage itself is very lovely. We had 2 queen beds, a big table and chair in the room and a built-in closet which was more than enough storage space! The d\u00e9cor is all wood and white which lends a nice, bright tropical feel to the room and is quite Mexican. The hammocks on the front porch are the highlight of the room!!! We just LOVED them and spent hours there reading and listening to the ocean. House keeping was very regular and we didn\u2019t have any issues with theft but we did keep money/passports etc locked up. Food/Restaurants/Bar/Shop: Breakfast has a lot of variety and it is located just off of the beach and is perfect to grab a bite and head back to the beach. So is the lunch restaurant. They have a limited selection but even with being vegetarian, I found enough options of delicious food. Dinner is a fun affair. The food is really very good and I must say that the Mexican food I had there was much better than any I have had in the US! The staff too is very friendly and they make a genuine effort to make your stay better! But I must admit that after 6 days of eating there, I was starting to tire of it! We didn\u2019t fall sick eating in Mexico but then, we only drank bottled water with no ice and didn\u2019t eat any pre-cut fruit/salads or uncooked food. The gift shop on-site carries bigger bottles of water at lower prices so look out for that. The drinks at the bar are average but the pool/ping pong area is fun. Look out for the book library at the lobby. Hotel: The hotel, on the whole, is fantastic! We selected this hotel for the experience of having a whole cottage to ourselves and it was completely worth it, esp. at the price! With lunch for 2 and a few drinks every day (not at happy hour) at the hotel for 6 days, our tab was just an additional USD110 totally! I didn\u2019t lack for anything except maybe a hair-dryer :-) \u2026.. and a telephone in the room to at least call the front desk. We certainly wouldn\u2019t hesitate to stay here again but we may try the beachfront cottage the next time around, just coz they are right there on the beach!!

We have always had nothing but wonderful experiences staying at Shangri-La and have recommended it to several family members, friends and co-workers, but we are not certain we can recommend this establishment any longer. I left yesterday with a sour taste in my mouth. It appears to us that they have hired THIEVES to do the cleaning or supervising of rooms! We stayed in 16B from June 11-18th and my husband had his Nautica swim trunks and a canvas hat stolen. My son had his Geoxx tennis shoes stolen. When a neighbor in 15B talked with me, he informed me that he had $100 stolen from the closet of his room. I realize that maybe tennis shoes, a hat and swim trunks seem petty theft, but I no longer trust that any of my things would be safe locked in my room! (especially after talking with the neighbor!) My husband filed a \"report\" with the \"Security\" but how do I know that they aren't part of the problem?!! When we discussed this with the front desk \"Rafael\", he didn't seem too concerned and acted as though WE were bothering HIM! He was basically useless and of NO help! What a waste! We were extremely upset and very disappointed! We can only suspect the cleaning people, since they are the ones that have a key to the room. My husband talked with one of the cleaning ladies, but of course she \"didn't have any idea what happened...\". I would keep an eye on those cleaning people and the so called security people! Also, a separate issue is the recommendation we received for a car rental. The staff recommended \"Express Car Rental\". It turned out to be a terrible, very unfortunate mistake on our part to have gone with this company. They provided a rusted out, unsafe, run down van with two flat tires and no reliable spare or the tools to change a tire! That company must be some major SCAM ARTISTS and I would never recommend them. After paying for \"full coverage insurance\", they wanted us to pay for the tire problems! They were very unreasonable!

The first 8 nights of our trip were spent at the resort where we had our wedding, which was an absolutely perfect experience in every way. During our vacation planning, we opted to move to the Shangri-La Caribe during the middle of our vacation for a change of scenery, and regretted our decision to do so almost immediately. The day we arrived at the Shangri-La, my husband had become very ill. Checkout time at our previous resort was at noon, so when we arrived at the Shangri-La, he wanted nothing more than to lie down, however, check-in wasn't until 3:00. We asked the front desk staff if there was any way we could check in early and were told our room wouldn't be ready until 3:00. We got that, thought it would be worth asking, and went off to kill a few hours until the room was ready. We came back at 2:45 to check again as he was really starting to feel poorly by this time, and were told that it would be ready at exactly 3:00. At exactly 3:00, the gentleman that had told us our room would be ready got off shift and left, without saying a word to us (we were sitting in the lobby waiting until 3:00 as my husband had had enough of walking around at that point). At 3:05, I asked the person behind the front desk about our room and was told that it wouldn't be ready for another hour. In fact, we were not able to check into our room until 5:00 that evening, thus beginning our frustration with this resort. When we were finally able to get into the room (we rented a beachfront bungalow - 34P), we immediately turned on the A/C as the heat was stifling. Unfortunately, with the high ceilings of the beachfront bungalows, the A/C units are totally inadequate to even remotely cool the rooms down, so if you reserve one of these units, prepare to be hot. We resorted to opening up all of the windows (there are a lot of them) and if there is a good breeze going it's not bad, but if there's no breeze, good luck. The next thing we discovered with the room was that the palapa roofs are utterly infested with thousands and thousands of tiny insects. I practically bathed in bug repellent, including covering the sheets and pillows, but was still eaten alive that night by the insects. The next morning I was covered in hundred of tiny bug-bites, so we decided to pay the front desk a visit to inquire as to what they could do about the bug infestation, and were told that we could move next door to 35P. When we asked if we could expect more bugs in 35P, they staff told us that the current occupants of that room hadn't complained about the bugs. We then asked if the bugs were usually a problem and they told us very frankly yes, the bugs are a big problem due to the thatched roofs. We opted to have our room fumigated as opposed to moving to a new room that more than likely had the same issues, and were told it would take no longer than an hour. We vacated the room, and when we came back to the room several hours later, it was very clear that the room had been fumigated, as all of the furniture was covered in sheets and there were thousands of insect carcasses everywhere, however, they had neglected to send someone to clean up the horrendous mess afterward. Back to the front desk we go (no phones in the room, so if you're having issues, plan on a lot of walking back and forth) to ask for housekeeping to clean up the mess and unfortunately, we weren't able to use our room until 6:00 that evening. Later that night we went into Playa for dinner and when we returned at roughly 9:30, the bug situation was even worse than before - with hundreds of these insects all over our pillows and sheets. We marched down to the front desk yet again and told them in no uncertain terms would we be staying in the room another night to be devoured in our sleep, and asked about having our money refunded so we could find another place to stay. We were told that the manager wouldn't be in until 9:00 the next morning, and that until she was the only person with the authority to refund our money, but that they would be glad to move us to another room without a palapa roof for the night. She also suggested that refunding the difference to us between the beachfront bungalow and the \"Ocean View\" room wouldn't be a problem at all, but that a refund was unlikely. We decided to move to the new room to give it a shot, and found that while this room (sans palapa roof) didn't have the tiny insects of the other room, it did have roaches, as well as an A/C unit that dripped water on us all night, and loud construction that began promptly at 8:00 AM. Good times. At promptly 9:00 AM the next morning we made yet another trip to the front desk to meet with the manager, who didn't bother to show up until 9:20. At 9:30, one of the front desk staff came to tell us (mind you, she couldn't be bothered to come speak to us herself) that the manager was suddenly called into a staff meeting and wouldn't be available for another 40 minutes. We went and had breakfast (contrary to what many other posters have said with regard to the breakfast, we were not at all impressed) and then back to the front desk to wait for the manager. When she finally did come speak to us, to her credit, she was very apologetic and accommodating; at first she offered to find us yet another room, refund the first two nights to us, and refund the difference between the beachfront bungalow and the new room. After a few moments of deliberation, we decided to cut our losses and asked for a full refund; we were just not confident that we would be able to relax and be comfortable there, and we were quickly burning through our honeymoon days. In the end, Turquoise Reef (their booking agent?) found us another property in downtown Playa Del Carmen, refunded the first two nights at the Shangri-La to us, as well as refunding the difference between the Shangri-La and the new property, as the new property wasn't located directly on the beach and was quite a bit less expensive. Again, to their credit, for upset as we were with the Shangri-La and our experience there, we felt that in the end, they made it right. I was so looking forward to our stay at the Shangri-La and was incredibly disappointed. I'm amazed that the issues that we ran into haven't been more of an issue among other guests. We truly aren't hard to please when it comes to a hotel, honestly, the first resort we stayed at was incredible, and the hotel that we ended up staying at in lieu of the Shangri-La turned out the be fantastic as well...I guess 2 out of 3 isn't bad?", "Date": "June 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Resort on the Beach\u201d", "Author": "Ancient", "ReviewID": "UR7729090", "Content": "My husband and I were there over our Spring Break with our two kids (9 & 6).

Breakfast, however, was wonderful with an excellent selection every morning and tons of fresh fruit. Delicious. Don't be in a hurry for your coffee, though; the waitstaff takes their time. Bar: This may be the only bar in Playa with bad margaritas. The guys were very friendly but the drinks were sub par. Room: I stayed in the Caribe section. Sparse but spotless. Our AC worked just fine and I was shocked by how comfortable the mattress was. I would have greatly preferred if housekeeping had not come to clean at 1:30pm, the exact moment when we got off of the dive boat and needed to shower. I loved the hammocks on our porch; we spent many hours there just hanging out and being happy. Staff: Most were wonderful but there were a few surly ones. Other: My massage was mediocre and expensive. WARNING: After talking to a lot of guests who had been coming to Shangri-la for a numbers of years, I got the impression that everything about the place had changed drastically. We were there at the same time as a large wedding party - 70 people plus. Just about every evening, a large group of men in their late 20's (I'm also that age) would gather by the pool with a boombox and drink beer from their styrofoam coolers. The hotel wasn't all that responsive to us when we asked them to kindly ask the loud, drunk men to settle down and kill the vulgar music. The fact that Shangri-la has tacky, inconsiderate guests isn't its fault, but I think this may just be the direction the area is going. The Dive shop - Cyan-ha - was absolutely wonderful. Every single member of the staff and crew were fun, professional and very safe. We really felt like our skills improved. Advanced divers are probably going to be a little bored but I highly recommend it for the novice/absolute beginner. To sum it up: This wasn't the best trip we've taken, but we did learn a little bit more about what is important to us. We still had a great time enjoying the nightlife, the diving and the laziness of the beach life. I would recommend this hotel to groups of friends who want to travel together, families with small children who want a laid back, pro-kid environment and novice divers.

Thank you all very much for your valuable insight and stories! It really helped us along. However, when it comes to the SLC I gotta say that I don't share many of your opinions. We booked a room for 7 nights at one of the beach front bungalows (34p). Now, while it is true that this hotel is located on one of the more gorgeous stretches of beach that Playa has to offer I found the hotel somewhat lacking. Perhaps it was just the room that we were in but I found it to be quite anitquated (in a not so charming way) and the room had a very musty smell when we checked it. Nothing that a $3 air freshener from Wal-Mart didn't fix. Further the bathroom was hotter than the blue blazes of hell and a bit funky also. Most of what we read about the food was fairly true... We only had dinner at the hotel one night (so many great restaurants in town) but it wasn't really all that great. Breakfast, on the other hand was awesome! Further, our server Eduardo couldn't have possibly been any nicer. The front desk staff was fairly helpful with the exception of one blonde woman... She was almost downright rude and her favorite word seemed to be no. Out of five requests, all of which quite legitimate she was able to fulfull none of them. By the end of the week it got to be quite irritating. The grounds at the hotel, in all fairness were gorgeous and the beach/ocean views from our bungalow couldn't be beat. But given the proximity to the \"action\" on Quinta and the shape our room was in I don't think that I personally would book this hotel again. There just seems to be a lot better deals in town for the price. The air conditioner in the room did little more than fan the flames of the scorching May weather we encountered...

At first I was a bit worried booking this resort - the name caused more than one travel agent I spoke with to cringe, and while the pictures on the website were amazing, I wasn't sure quite what to think. I am glad I trusted the reviews on this website because the resort is fantastic! I booked an 'ocean view' room on the caribe side since the beach front rooms were all taken, and I'm glad I went that route. I requested a 2nd floor room with a king size bed, neither of which were guaranteed to me when I booked, but which the staff graciously accomidated. This meant that we had a basically unobstructed view of the beach and ocean which was only ~20 feet from the base of our stairs. The porch got a wonderful breeze all day and despite the heat, it was cool all afternoon. The rooms are rather sparsely furnished but we needed for nothing - it had a large, comfortable king size bed and a desk and chair, what else do you need?(wink):-). The A/C was rather noisy, but we didn't use it except at night since the daytime breeze was nice and strong. The construction behind the Aventura (playa?) side of the resort is nearly complete, so construction noise is no longer an issue. This side appears to be a bit newer and the penthouse 3rd floor rooms look very nice and come with some nice lounge chairs on the patios - a nice perk. We spoke with several guests who were very happy on this side of the resort - I think you probably can't go wrong no matter which side you choose. I'd avoid the rooms on the back side of the caribe section though - those have no view of the ocean at all and likely miss out on the afternoon breezes that make the heat tolerable. The grounds are beautiful and its hard to tell where the beach ends and the resort begins...I guess that is the point, right? There was never a rush on beach chairs and they all come with palpas to shade you from the hot afternoon sun (I'm a freckler, so I need this kind of thing!). The beach is amazing and generally quite empty during the week - we noticed the beach south of Shangri-la was much more crowded and we were happy to have our little section of seclusion. The pools were wonderful and again, never crowded. We took the advice here and brought our own cooler from home (it was collapsable...yeah TARGET!) and filled it every day from the corner store with beer. The drinks at the resort are moderately priced and VERY good - mmmmm margaritas. Happy hour is from 5-6 at the Caribe pool - 2x1 drinks! The food...breakfast was excellent - so many wonderful fresh fruits and beautiful pasteries. You can also order hot breakfast, and all of the selections were excellent. The french toast is great, but my personal favorite is scrambled eggs with choriso and peppers. YUM. Coffee is quite good. Lunch was also great. While we saw others suggest going elsewhere to eat, we were so comfortable lounging at the resort that the thought of walking up and down 5th when it was so hot just wasn't appealing, so we did most of our lunches (when on resort and not off snorkeling or on a tour) at the resort restaurant. Ceviche is wonderful, as are all the taco selections. We found the prices reasonable for a resort...and also compared to many 5th ave. eateries. Dinner was hit or miss, I agree. Our 1st dinner was not very good - choice of chicken or steak...and my chicken had many small bones which did a number on my throat...ouch. HOwever we tried dinner at the resort mid week and it was very good! The fish selections were all tasty, as was the 'carribean night'. We heard good and bad things about the mexican buffet - some said it was cold. Overall we ate at the resort for 4 meals and ate in town for 3. The staff was wonderful and very helpful every time we asked a question. The wait staff was super, remembering us and our room number at each meal. And I have to give props to the front desk attendants, who let my husband borrow a bicycle to head into town the last night we were there since there were no cabs outside and he had to pull cash to cover my doctor's visit (I broke my toe outside of the massage tent! Watch out for the hidden stump!). It is too bad I was laid up in the room with my toe on ice because I'll bet that was the funniest sight ever!

The other reviews are pretty spot-on. So I won't repeat it all, just a few points: BUILDING The building work behind the Aventura section is still going on, but it's mostly inside and they must be finishing soon. Some noise mon-fri, they finish early on saturday and don't work sundays. BEACH The hotel is on the nicest stretch of beach in Playa by far, when you walk towards the centre of town, you realise how lucky you are and it's worth the ten minute walk into town. It's quite easy to get a sun lounger (this was in May), no need for a morning panic. ROOMS The hotel could do with an update, it's a bit 1970s decor, I know it's Mexican but for these prices, I would have hoped for doors onto the bathroom/toilet. The room was a bit sparse and lacks the luxe comforts you would expect of this rating of hotel. A fridge, TV, soft lighting and even some drawers would have been great also. MASSAGE I had a massage in the grounds of the hotel, man named Gabriel, very good. It's more expensive than in town but was nice to be near my room and very relaxing. RAIN There were two thunderstorms while we were there, one night everyone's room got flooded so if it looks like rain, don't leave anything on the floor and put electricals in the wardrobe. FOOD We ate breakfast everyday (great selection), but only ate dinner at the hotel twice. It was pretty basic (plus I'm a vegetarian) and it was good to get out as we wanted to avoid that all-inclusive vibe. Found a FABULOUS restaurant in Playa called Chicagos (on 6th, just off Quinta). Sound cheesy but it was lovely neighbourhood restaurant. Much nicer than the tourist traps on Quinta. We also ate at 100% natural and the food was very nice (if you like healthy/veggie stuff) but not very busy so no atmosphere. TRANSPORT We got the hotel transportation through Tropical Reef and it's probably quite costly ($55 airport-hotel and same again return) but it was stress free.

Also,less expensive trip than most others [can you spell dot.com bust?]. It was a trepidatious adventure for us (well, for me) because I tend toward luxe, small establishments in hideaway, private places. Whilst Shangri La Caribe isn't enormous, only 90 cabanas/rooms, that's bigger than the largest beach resort we've stayed in (Cap Juluca on Anguilla); and Caribe is on the north end of the town of Playa del Carmen so it's not a hideaway in any way, it sits directly on the town beach frequented by Caribe patrons, other tourists and locals (therein, by the way, is much of its charm as we learned). Caribe does restrict use of its palapas and beach chaises to guests but there's never a \"rush\" to stake out chairs since they are sufficient unto the demand. We, however, did early on claim our chaises because we wanted the palapa that was six feet from our beachfront cabana but that wasn't difficult to snag. There are several categories of lodging, we opted for a beachfront cabana (of which there only are 8 or so, thus reserving early is a plus); it's the most expensive level at $280/night for two including breakfast, dinner, taxes (which can mount up) and tip (although we added a substantial gratuity upon departure because the service was close to sublime). We were 20 yards from the waves with nothing between us and the view (except sun bathers, beach walkers and the occasional topless gal). Other categories are: penthouses (don't bother unless you're in great shape [on the third floor of a cabana and the underlying floors are generously tall]). Also, these are on the Playa side of the resort, the least interesting, and the beach isn't as nice for swimming as on the other (Caribe) end of the resort (but it's closest to breakfast); there's some construction going on in the Playa area, too. Caribe (where we stayed) is the best area -- close to the beach and ocean (and therefore cooler) if one didn't want to opt for a beachfront cabana, the logical mid-price choice would be a non-beachfront cabana (no one on top, no one below), your own little casita and it's worth it. One with an ocean view is worth it, too. Caribe is the largest area and the best, in my opinon. Pueblecito is in the rear of the property, furtherest from the beach and, therefore, from the cooling breezes (although rooms have AC which usually is a shame to use unless one really must). Pueblecito rooms are in a series of small groups, not free-standing cabanas. If the only way I could stay at Caribe is in a Pueblecito room, I wouldn't hesitate a minute, would book it happily, so wonderful is the overall experience. Besides, all lodgings come with two hammocks on a patio/porch/deck. Rates (April - Dec. 15, 2007) for doubles including breakfast, dinner, tax and gratuity are: $160, $180, $200, $220, $265, $280. Those rates are excellent for the area. Also, Shangri La Caribe is a family-owned establishment and cares about its customers. The beach is, as tourist brochures like to say, powder soft. The water in April was delightful, a bit chilly upon entry but then utterly fabulous, bouyant and to die for. I'm a waterbaby and adore bobbing about in the ocean. There wasn't a day you couldn't swim/play/bob in the water; it's calm and welcoming and gorgeously clear -- for as far out as you can swim, you can see the ocean floor. There are two nice-looking pools; we preferred the ocean (also the Playa-side pool seemed to be kid-central). Food -- if you research Caribe here at TripAdvisor, you'll see complaints about the food. Here's our take. Breakfast is splendid including limitless fresh fruit (pineapple, papaya, mango, oranges, banana, melon, sometimes grapefruit), and all the fresh OJ you can drink plus one other fresh juice (in April that was watermelon or a mango/papaya). There are Mexican pan dulces (which I adore) consisting of a variety of sweet pastries, some with custard. They are made in the Caribe bakery and are luscious. There's dry cereal, yogurt, real oatmeal and a large selection of hot meals including egg dishes (Mexican and not) and pancakes. I don't usually eat pancakes but these were wonderful so I had 'em four days in a row! Coffee and tea, of course, even decent tea. Downside of breakfast: no 1/2 'n 1/2, instead you have to poach from the jug of hot whole mile next to the oatmeal urn. Skim and low-fat milk is offered. One must ask for ice-water but it's safe. Lunch isn't provided as part of the rate but is available to order and the prices are reasonable. I hate to say this but the hamburgers were excellent (Mexican beef can't be beat). There are many places on the beach to lunch; we mostly skipped lunch (I was trying to sort-of diet, after all). Dinner -- now this is where TripAdviser posters let loose. I have to say, the food was good mostly. Not four star but I didn't expect it would be. We stayed seven nights and in that time had three buffets: BBQ, by far the best, don't miss it; Yucatean/Mexican was tasty; Caribbean was good to OK. Other dinners were three or four courses (salad, soup, entre, dessert) with a choice of two entres (usually between fish and meat/chicken or between meat/vegetarian) and were good. Other than juice and coffe/tea at breakfast as well as the liter-bottle of still water with which the room is replenished daily, drinks are extra but reasonably priced (don't miss Happy Hour from 5 to 6pm). The clientele -- now, this is interesting. I'd been expecting a majority comprised of North Americans. But, I'd estimate these demographics: 40% Norte Americano, 45% European and 15% Mexican. Some families with kids but not so many as to disturb me and I'm semi kidphobic. The Europeans in the main were Scandinavian, Polish, German and Dutch.", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cParadise Found for the 2nd time\u201d", "Author": "MissingParadise", "ReviewID": "UR7539833", "Content": "This trip was AMAZING.

The pool on the Caribe side you can do laps in but only during off hours. Both pools are not deep. Agree with another reviewer that the pool with the Jacuzzi in it, on the Aventura a.k.a.Playa side, is occupied by small children including children in diapers or no suits at all. That was a huge turn off. The beach is quite nice but the ocean was rough during our stay thus we did not venture into the water.

The dinner buffets were very good and the ala carte evenings, while limited choice, were decent. Service was great everywhere, the property is very clean.

I hope this hotel stays just like it is amidst all the growth & construction going on in Playa.", "Date": "March 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg", "Title": "\u201cAn Honest Review by a Hotel Manager on vacation\u201d", "Author": "MarinaWinnipeg", "ReviewID": "UR7165638", "Content": "First off, let me tell you that I am hard to impress and love to stay in 5 diamond properties. While the Shangri-La Caribe would not typically meet a 5 diamond award I think it authenticity and location give it that grade. Here are some things to think about when considering this Hotel. This property is beachfront, that is a plus for access. There are many options for rooms, some have a lot of foot traffic passing them by others are remote and secluded. Be sure that you are asking for the exact room type that will make you happy. We started in 30P which is a penthouse at the far end of the property beside the mexican beach. It was up three flights of stairs, which was great because the exercise allowed us to eat a bit more! The room was fantastic, king bed, lots of space open air to a view and the breeze. For the last half we stayed in 5c a cabana right on the beach. Walk out the front door to your beach spot. The beachfront cabana can be noisy at night because people pass by having fun. There is ample security checking the grounds at all times. They move people along as quickly as possible...but it you are a light sleeper you may wish a different location. But then again, you'd miss out on the sounds, sights and smells of staying right on the beach! There are no hairdryers in the suites and amenities are sparse, sheets are standard not 300 thread count and no plush mattresses...but everything in the rooms is clean and comfortable..so no worries.. The food is satisfactory, but we didnt eat at the Hotel that much..because there are so many fantastic restaurants close by to experiences. Stroll down 5th avenue and thise choices are endless. Drink prices at the Hotel are pricey...we bought a cooler and drinks at walmart and a cooler and shipped it back home with us. well worth it. The Hotel should consider buying some small fridges for the rooms because they have the space. There are no phones or televisions in the rooms. The lack of a phone has its pluses and minuses...but you do get your exercise...All of the staff are friendly and well trained...great dive shop, nice pools, well maintained yards, good cleaning staff, nice food and beverage servers....overall I can't find anything to discredit this great Hotel. One of our favorite spots close to the Hotel is the Cuevo del chango...this is a great spot for a breakfast alternative... The hotel is expensive but worth it.", "Date": "March 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAnother lovely stay in Playa\u201d", "Author": "queencityfan", "ReviewID": "UR7154391", "Content": "Just as a starting place this was my 4th trip to Playa Del Carmen since July. In that time I stayed at the Iberostar Del Mar, The Luna Blue and the Barcelo Maya Beach. We are no strangers to the beauty of this place and specifically booked at the Shangri La after we explored the property in September. That said: Check-in and Front Desk- Very helpful and friendly service as we arrived. In no time at all we had our room , safe keys, beach towels and the bellman took our bags to our room. We did use the service of the Consierge to book a reservation for dinner in town one night, very convienent. Rooms- We had an oceanview room, 1P on the first floor, the first two nights of our weeklong stay. This room is right in front of the large condos being constructed behind the Adventura side of the resort. We heard very little noise from the area and it never hindered our enjoyment of the room. I will have to say that they have the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in in Mexico, great sheets, lots of fluffy pillows. The room is very basic but the air worked great and the ceiling fans did too. The remaining part of our trip we stayed in 31P, beachfront. This large room was poolside on the Adventura side. Huge porch running the length of the bungalow and nothing but palm trees and ocean to look at while you have your morning coffee there. The room itself was very large but needed a chest of drawers as there was only a couple of shelves to put your clothes on. The weather was cool the first night we stayed here so we went to sleep with the windows open and let the ocean put us to sleep. As it got warmer during the week the air conditioner struggled to keep the room very cool due to the high palapa ceiling. Great tiled walk in shower and double sinks with hot water and good pressure for showering and flushing.Our housekeeper did a very nice job in keeping our room well supplied and clean. Property The grounds here are beautiful! Many flowers, trees etc and they are all very well kept. The pools are quite nice and refreshing but I too wish the babies would not take over the Jacuzzi. Although we chose to stay on the beach for a special occasion I would not hesitate to stay anywhere else on the property to save a few dollars, the beach is mere moments from any room.If you are interested in coming back you should be sure to walk the property, jotting down room locations that might appeal to you. They offer an Internet room as well as wireless access,just go to the desk to sign up, a nice gift shop sells souviners, ice cream etc The most important feature here is the spectacular beach and wonderful water. Food and Drinks We only missed breakfast one morning. For those of you who need that coffee before 7:30 they set up a coffee pot by both pools, just go get a cup in your jammies, it's pretty laid back here. The fruit was so delicious, great breads and pastries not to mention the Mexican specialties and many varieties of eggs and meats. Service was normally very good and attentive. We ate lunch here several days. Although it is a bit pricy the portions are very large and could easily be shared for an afternoon snack to tide you over till dinner. As we prefer to eat at one of the many great places in Playa for dinner we only had dinner at the resort one night. We happened to be there on a Mexican buffet night and it was pretty basic but good. We also thought the bar drinks were on the high side, just be sure to go at happy hour between 5 & 6 for a better deal. We did purchase a foam cooler for beer and soda in our room and at the beach. There is a small store a couple of blocks from the hotel that has most anything you could need by way of drinks and snacks. Small bags of ice can be purchased at the bars at the resort. Overall As a previous reviewer mentioned there were many families with small children staying here. Most were well behaved as were their parents but I can see why some people would like a quieter atmosphere. We found that sitting at the beach under a palapa you heard very little except the ocean waves breaking on the sand. Playa Del Carmen is a growing city, 10 years ago there only 12,000 people living there, now it is over 200,000 so of course there will be more of the conviences of the modern world, ie WalMart, chain fast food etc... Who are we ,as tourists, to object to that? The beauty of the Shangri La is that it still offers a warm relaxing setting in the fastest growing city in Mexico and I for one am glad they do.", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "PaolaOttawa", "ReviewID": "UR7013540", "Content": "The hotel it\u2019s nice, it is a different type of resort.

The Hotel and beaches were exactly what we imagined and had hoped for. Took our own cooler, asked for the pueblito section, second floor ( to get away from construction noise). but mostly to experience the thatched roofs without the beach front price. The way the hotel is set up, this section is actually closest to the activities. When we placed our requests, they wouldn't confirm a room or floor until our arrival. But they did grant all of our requests. The vast majority of the staff is exceptional and friendly. We did not bring our kids this trip, but the staff really catered to and even played with other guests kids. I would highly recommend if your going to bring your children, of any age to Mexico, that it be Playa and even the Shangri La. The rooms are very clean and new with great beds. Very minimal water pressure in the showers, that change from hot, to very hot, to frigid without warning. But heh, this is Mexico, did not damper my spirit or attitude. If your looking for a laid back, rustic, sandy island vacation. This place is for you. If you want a high rise, glamor and late night party crowd, this isn't for you. Food is acceptable, but not exceptional. My only disapointment, isn't with the Shangri La, as I mentioned we did a lot of research prior to booking. We have been to most ports on the Western side of Mexico. This was our first try at the Carribean side. Can you say, Walmart, Sams Club, McDonalds, Burger King, Subway, no public transportation. $1 a mile cab fare. This was not an inexpensive trip to Mexico. Don't expect 10 peso beers or lobster and shrimp on the beach for $20 us. Expect a Mexican Disneyland, as everything is a theme park (Xel Ha and Xcaret) with high prices and a sucking sound aimed at your wallet. I long for my place on the western side of Mexico, where a $200 a night room offers your own infinity pool over looking the ocean, 10 peso Coronas with shimp and lobster delivered on the beach for $20 for 2. Can't tell you where it is or the price will go up and Walmart will move in. Lastly my hat is off to the service provided by little Miguel at the bar, who \"may\" be getting married in September, the seniorita at the lobby desk and both of the bell hops. Exceptional! Don't bother with the older bar tender, the older gentle man at the lobby desk or the consierge. They have seen too many tourist to care about your trivial questions. If your headed to the Riviera Maya, have lots of spending cash, want a peaceful laid back beautiful hotel, this is for you. Better book quick before development pushes it aside.

And as the huge condo buildings continue to gobble up all the space around it, Shangri La feels even more precious. We love the waiters, the nicest, most professional of anyplace we've stayed in the world. It was actually a joy to see them in the morning and talk with them about their families, etc. And the resort is as gorgeous as ever! No complaints at all, but it is not fancy. I do wish that there was a sign posted that infants in diapers may not use the hot tub. The infants and young children seem to have claimed it as their own, crowding out the adults who might want to use it. The bacteria level is probably pretty high since the temperature fosters more bacteria growth. I never saw a child in the kiddie pool the whole time I was there! Fifth Avenue is a wonderful street and we love to walk it each night. We found a number of excellent restaurants that were not like US chains. Pettit Marrakesh serving Moroccan food (Calle Corazon) was a favorite and we liked the French restaurant on the same block. The Italian restaurant Riviera served fresh and tasty pastas, fish, and more. It's closer to Shangri La than some of the others so the street is not as crowded. For authentic Mexican fare, try La Cueva del Chango just a block up from the resort. It's great fun on Sundays when the locals are there, does not feel touristy at all. And if you are adventurous, there is a Mayan restaurant as well that is interesing as well as delicious. We are return visitors who have a favorite room, which happens to be one of the most expensive rooms there. However, it was right next to the construction and we had, yes I really mean it, a chain saw going for three days straight. Another room was offered to us, but we did not want to move, asking instead for one free night (out of 10 there). No go. And, in contrast to the wait staff and bartenders, the front desk was surly, unhelpful and seemed not to care. To be fair, though, in contrast to another writer's experience, the concierge was quite helpful and gladly booked our dinner reservations. We missed the old on-site restaurant that allowed one to eat lunch outside, but I heard that when the hurricane blew it away, the decision was made not to re-build it. I don't know if that is true or not, but I much preferred eating outside to eating in the breakfast room. Because Shangri La is so laid back, the temptation is to not leave, but there are so many wonderful things to see from the Mayan ruins at Coba to the majestic Tulum. Also the biosphere at Sian Ka'an. I just read about the underwater caves and cenotes near Valladolid so we'll probably check that out next trip. I would recommend this place, but as you can see above, there are faults.

It was a totally different experience but much more satisfying. It is lovely to be able to walk along 5th Avenue to experience something other than the resort. Pros: - Location just far enough away from town but near enough to walk. - Laundry mat only 1 block away (I think the hotel should advertise this as many travellers are looking for that benefit. - The beach, pool and rooms are kept spotlessly clean daily. - Staff are very fun and very interactive - \"Hello My Friend\" - Lots of chairs at the pool and beach. The best part of the chairs is because the resort is right beside a public beach (both sides), guests can't leave their towels on the chairs to save them because if taken you owe $30. - Nice pool with jacuzzi a few degrees warmer. - Safe in the room (although small). I am uncertain why resorts insist on putting your room number on your key that is attached to your safe key - not really safe at all. - food, is very good. Breakfast is excellent and dinner is average. The reviewers that say the food is awful I suspect are never happy with food - other than 5 star. This is Mexico. - The view of the ocean is great from all of the Adventura rooms (feel like you are in a tree house). - hammocks on the balconies are a nice touch. - Internet (however it was down the full 5 days we were there and I suspect longer than that). - bar has happy hour and happy staff. A nice social area for people to mingle. - Security staff are very friendly and always out watching that the public does not come into the resort. The Shangri La needs a sign to say who they are as people are interested and walk off the beach into the resort to ask someone what the name is. - There is an aircondition and a fan, however just open the windows (that are all newly screened) and let the air blow through. Cons: -No fridge. You would think that when you are paying over $200 a night a fridge would be a nice asset. You are forced to hike down to Walmart and pick up a cooler that you can put your beer and water in). Interesting that there is never a cooler that the guest before you left behind. There is a store a block away that supplies ice for a meager $1.30. It is a pain though. Those with babies would really find it difficult. A Micro wouldn't be such a large expense either. - No TV - at least the ability to rent a DVD player and a movie when the weather is bad would be nice. Bring one with you or there is a Blockbuster a few blocks away. - Something to clean the sand out of your room (a little dustpan) so you don't drag sand into your bed each night. - Some parts of the structure are run down. - The lobby needs to be more inviting - dark and dingy with dirty furniture. You feel like you are walking into a hostel and not expensive resort. Some sort of orientation or a map would be a nice welcome from the staff at the front. We arrived a few hours early and had to wait until 3:00 exactly to get into our room - we know it was empty. The check out is a little late at 1:00 pm. - Mattress covers on the bed. For 3 or the 5 nights we had no mattress cover on the bed - just a sheet. YUCK! - The doors are not that secure. No extra locks or chains - just the one that the maid can open. No peep hole either. A phone in the room to contact security if there was a problem would definitely be safety consideration. - The pool on the Adventurer side has no food wash - just the full shower. When it is windy you have to run around to try catch the water (oh well, who really cares). Tips: - don't have the hotel/bell person arrange a cab to Cancun or the Airport for you. They arrange $70, you arrange $45. All in all we would highly recommend Shangri La. The encroaching development will definitely prove to be problematic for the public beach area in Playa Del Carmen.

First of all, this place is awesome and worth every penny. An aging all-inclusive resort from back in the day, when Playa was a small undeveloped secret, Shangri-la Caribe miraculously retains its serenity and unparalleled beauty. In the 1980s Shangri-la was on the outskirts; now, even though you can drive right up, park and walk in, it still has that tucked away feeling of an undiscovered secret. As many have said, it is located on the most beautiful, perfect stretch of beach in the area. Upon arrival, you find yourself at the end of calle 38, which ends in sand. Don't worry about parking, there will be a spot. No meters, just park anywhere, and be enthralled at the paradise that welcomes you. First, you see a spwrawling open-air palapa rotunda with a stone-tiled floor, strewn with couches and places to lounge. (Wireless-enabled throughout). There's no big sign, just a big front desk. The rooms are basically little cottages situated among windy stone and tile paths dotted with coconut trees: imagine a Mayan village at the apex of that civilization. Our cottage had a little patio with a table and 2 hammocks, a hexagonal shape mimicking the hexagonal shape of the room itself. Both the patio and the room are topped with palapas. (I was wary of this because I feared bugs getting through, but the thatch is very thick and resilient, and topped with netting for extra security). It issurprisingly airtight and yet somehow admits fresh air. The a/c works great. The room has a writing desk, two queen beds and several windows, with ingenious wooden shutters that open to reveal screens, should you be so insane as to wish natural air instead of a/c. There's also an overhead ceiling fan for extra comfort. I've seen other comments on the lack of shelves, but our room had plenty. We had a large closet with shelves to the right and over the top. Plenty of space to store shoes and clothing, as well as valuables in the safe. Kind of moot though, since your'e in Playa. Just bring a few swimsuits, diving gear and some shorts and flipflops. We hung our snorkle gear on the curtain rods. The bathroom is outfitted with tile sconces where you can store your toiletries, and is a stucco and tile affair, with a huge walk-in shower. I'm 6'1\" and I hate short showers; this one was just about tall enough. The water pressure and temperature control are better than my shower at home. The shower releases water in about 50 tiny streams, so it's that kind of light and quiet shower, rather than heavy and splattery. The hotel provides a basket of quality soaps, shampoos, etc. The suite we had in Pueblito/Caribe comes with either 2 queens or one king bed. We got 2 queens and while I prefer a king, these beds were comfortable with quality mattresses, with built-in mattress pads on top. While I'm not too fussy about mattresses, I know a good one and these were not \"hard\" as so many have said beds in Mexico are. Compared to my $300 mattress at home, these were equal. (Incidently, I ordered a king - speaking Spanish really helps, but regardless, I was far from disappointed). Every cottage room has easy access to the pool and beach. A beachfront spot seems great, but since it takes 2 to 3 minutes to reach the beach from anywhere in the resort, the advantage of beachfront would only be the view. It's coconut trees and cats vs. lapping ocean waves. I love cats so it was great. Palapas are provided on the beach, and there always seem to be plenty avalailable. It could have been the season (August), but regardless, you can easily spend the whole day lounging, swimming and snorkeling right in front of the hotel. The restaurant on the beach delivers food several times a day, but it's not that cheap and we had a great time supplementing our pina coladas with a cooler full of snacks and beers. You can take a little walk up the street and find great little take-out places that will make you a huge lunch from about $5.00 to $25.00 for two (depends on what you want - I tend to seek out locals-only stands). There's also a bar on the Caribe side, maybe 1 minute's walk from your spot on the sand. The staff is friendly and keeps the property in perfect shape. Tips are not expected, but we noticed other people tipping and the bartenders are very happy with tips. The bar is well-stocked and the bartenders friendly, but shots are $6 and up, and drinks are pricey. Take advantage of happy hour, and just go elsewhere for serious drinking. The bar closes early (11 PM). There are 2 pool tables and 2 pingpong tables in the lounge next to the bar and swimming pool. The games are free, but the pool tables are pretty warped, so just do some drinking and don't bet on any 9-ball! The property has 2 swimming pools. The water is warm and shallow, making these great places to nurse a fruity drink. Bugs and vermin: in August/September, there are plenty of mosquitoes and possibly other biting insects. I found success with a 7% deet Cutter bug spray. It's not like swarms of bugs hassling you, like in South Carolina or something. They come out at night, and if you use bug spray, you might suffer a bite or two: a trifling nuisance. We also had small, almost microscopic, ants in our room, but we didn't keep much food around and they were harmless and infrequent. We also had a resident lizard, about 1.5 inches long. Lizards don't bother me, and they eat bugs! Food: I don't like all-inclusive resorts, but Shangri-la does not have a restrictive feel at all. It's worth the money even if you don't take advantage of all the amenities. The first night, I was travel-weary and had been up all night. The restaurant was serving a set menu: you could start with a salad of julienned carrots, jicama, tomatoes, peppers and greek olives on a bed of shredded lettuce with olive oil dressing, or half an avocado filled with shrimp in a cool, creamy dressing. The entree was either a chicken cordon bleu, which looked horrible, or a salmon steak with veggies and mashed potatoes. The salmon was a perfectly-cooked filet, prepared in butter with a mild green sauce. buttered broccoli accompanied it, perfectly done, and decent mashed potatoes. Dinner with served with a basket of bread and drinks were extra. It was okay all in all, and you won't be disappointed on a budget, but as anyone who's been to Playa will tell you, there a millions of cheap, awesome alternatives. The breakfast is also very good and there's a variety of Mexican and european favorites. Fresh fruit, yogurt, granola, oatmeal and Mexican specialties like Chorizo and eggs, as well as French toast and almost anything you want, made to order. Good coffee. If you're lounging on the beach, eventually someone will come by and ask you if you want lunch. There's plenty of variety. I tried shrimp tacos: small flour tortillas with beans, grilled onions and freshly grilled shrimp for $10, delivered to your lounge without you lifting a finger, and it's a lot of food. Still, take my advice and look elsewhere for food. Shangri-la Caribe is not a typical 5-star resort with valet parking and car service. It's staffed by helpful, informative and friendly people and it's really low-key. If you want the feeling of being left alone in a tropical paradise, while behind the scenes everything is taken care of for you, stay here.

We are avid readers of trip advisor reviews and rely heavily upon the opinions of others before we book reservations anywhere. We enjoyed our stay with Shangri La very much but probably will stay elsewhere next visit. What we liked: Very beautiful beach with excellent security. Close to town but not too close. We never even saw a beach vendor, which for us and Mexico was a first. Excellent breakfast cuisine and service was attentive. Very clean rooms with lots of space. Average beds though, kinda hard. They include 2 hammocks with each room, use them. 2 great pools kept spotlessly clean. Good bar, gameroom with nice happy hour. They ring the bell at 5:00pm and again at 6:00pm to bracket this 2 for 1 time. Good stocking of this bar with ALL mexican beers available. NO TV's , lots of Euro-guests. What we didnt' like: (nitpicking) Rooms need a mini-bar so that at least you can keep your drinking water cool. Rooms need phones so you can call the front desk or home. Better dinner food that isn't so bland. Although their Sunday night Mexican buffet was very good, we skipped the other dinners. Summary: All in all, this is a very nice place to stay and you should not worry if they don't have an ocean vew room available. The garden view rooms farthest from the construction (units 50-59) are the best. Ask for an upstairs unit with balcony. Many of the ocean view rooms are too close to the beach and lack privacy from other guests and locals walking by. We stayed in 51b. The most private, least crowded section of their beach is over on the side by the morning breakfast restaurant. After breakfast getting a palapa there was no problem and very quiet despite the contruction closer to the street. However the beach right there is rocky and difficult (painful) to wade out into. Better to walk 75 yards south and wade out there where it's mostly sandy but more crowded. My only non-nitpicking complaint is that the front desk staff is \"indifferent\". Not just to me because I experienced other people having the same problem. They need training on how to welcome guests when they first arrive. Oh, and here's an idea, hire a bellboy or two to carry the arriving guests luggage to their rooms and maybe even upstairs. This \"attitude\" is probably the only thing besides dinner keeping them from getting perfect rating from me.

Not only is the staff incredibly friendly and accommodating, but everything was clean and well maintained. We stayed in a third floor suite on the Aventura side right next to the Aventura dining room where we held our reception. The daily breakfasts were yummy, fresh and cozy with \"delicious coffee.\" The dinners were great too! We just didn't understand what all the complaining about the food was, seriously. Oh! You HAVE to have a hamburger at lunch time and order a side of guacamole for your chips. I know it' s not traditional Mexican fare, but after a night of Don Julio shots and Tecate, you will be in tip-top shape again. If you decide to visit, please say hello to the waiter Miguel from Ryan and Erica! Everyone remembered our names and could not have been any nicer.

Just get up early, get in your hammock and remember you are in paradise for a short amount of time so just ENJOY it!! They're making it better for everyone to keep coming back!! Truth be told, my parents bought a condo in town while we were there because they loved it so much in Playa. I would also agree to buy a cooler at Wal-mart and stock up on beer to bring with you down to the beach. There is a very cute little market up the street from the reception where you can buy hard liquor to make mixed drinks or tons of beer to choose from as well. Beer cozies really help too. We put them in the welcome bags we packed for everyone when they checked in to the hotel. Also, bug spray for your ankles and calves at night because that is the only thing the bugs seem to like attacking. Weird thing is, you don't even feel it until the next day. I am posting my pictures and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions because I could rave for pages and pages about how wonderful it is.

For one thing, this four story \"temple like\" building is totally out of place in front of the Caribbean palapas of shangri-la. (Check my pictures). It just ruins most of the setup. But what is really a problem, is the terrible construction noise, starting at 6:30 AM (no typo here). Most of the week it was annoying but bearable hand hammering, but on two days we got unbelievable noisy machine hammering which kept us awake. Moving to another room was not easy since most of the Aventura and Left Caribe Sections were affected and finally we had to downgrade to a Pueblito section room which, although not bad, was not the same as the Caribe room. The hotel reception staff seemed overwhelmed by the problem. So, my advice is: Coose a room as far away as possible from the construction (right side of Caribe section, next to Las Palapas, should be ok) or check whether there will be construction activity during your stay.

It was fantastic! We researched (on-line) probably every hotel from Tulum up to Puerta Morales, relying heavily on trip advisor reviews. Shangri-La was everything we expected and more. Our room, 2nd level Aventura side, was great. Clean, big, comfortable beds, and the tiled shower is nice. A large closet and a dresser for our clothes! Also a suit case rack that we used mostly for drying stuff - there was also a clothes line with clothes pins on the patio. The patio was great with two chairs a table and two hammocks. The bar at happy hour (5:00 - 6:00) was full of people but not obnoxious. It has 2 ping pong tables and 2 pool tables and always had some people having a good time. (unlike the bar next door at Las Palapas - we went there one night after Shangri-La happy hour and it was quiet and deserted - not even any music playing. Although their happy hour was from 4:30 - 7:00 and I guess if you go early there is a bar right on the beach at happy hour that is pretty fun). The staff at Shangri-La - especially the staff at the restaurants - is excellent. Always smiling and extremely helpful. They definitely made our stay more enjoyable. I was a bit nervous about the \"all inclusive\" food and atmosphere. I was pleasantly surprised. Each restaurant was set up like a restaurant. You could have nice romantic dinners and never felt like you were at a cafeteria. There were mixed reviews on the food that we had read. Maybe they have a new chef but, all of the food was good. Considering it is hard to spend less than $45 for a meal in town (and usually more with drinks and an appetizer), we thought the all inclusive deal was well worth it. The only thing negative I would say is that there was not a lot of variety from night to night - mostly a choice between pork or fish as a main course or a Mexican type buffet. There was more variety in the soups and appetizers for dinner. Breakfast was always good. There are some great restaurants in town to choose from and it is definitely worth it to walk over for a couple nights - an easy pleasant walk. Or it is a $3 cab ride. There is still construction going on behind/next to the resort. This could bother some people - it wasn't a problem for us. Really only the morning that the trash truck was there - did it wake us up. We never missed the TV or the phones in the room. There is internet service at the hotel for $1.50 for 30 minutes (although the keyboard was a little off - the \"a\" key typed a q and the \"q\" key typed an a - etc..). Tips: Bring a beer cozy to keep your beer or soda cool at the beach. Go the the market - there is a super market called \"Mega\" right in town - and get a disposable cooler for ice and drinks in your room. Bug spay for the evenings - it wasn't terrible but it is the tropics and mosquitos definitely come out. Renting a car was well worth the money if you want to go up and down the coast or to the ruins. Get the damage waiver as not all of the roads are perfect and there are plenty of trucks dropping rocks. We paid as much for the car as we would have just for cabs to and from the airport. Snorkeling in Aventura is great if you want to avoid the touristy waterparks. We saw Sea Turtles, reefs and all kinds of beautiful fish and only paid $10 for the equipment at the Aventura Dive shop. We would definitely go back to Shangri-La. We met nice people and had one of the best vacations we have ever had. It is quiet relaxing and has a nice beach with palapas, lounge chairs and great swimming areas. Also, it is one of the only hotels in Playa del Carmen with a pool right on the beach and a Jacuzzi. The Jacuzzi is not hot but is still warm and nice in the evening or when it gets cloudy or rainy.

It is only a five or ten minute walk to the famous fifth avenue either along the beach or out the front lobby you can walk the street. There are all kinds of shops, restaurants and bars.

Well if we could go back in time we definitely would have done all 10 at the Shangrila, it is as nice as everyone says.. We stayed in the pueblito section which is very nice.. A little walk to the beach, but the rooms are all redone and in excellent shape... Food- as described breakfast is excellent, dinners a little more hit and miss somewhat monotonous, but the service was prompt and waiters always willing to help and extremely accomodating.. Rooms-Pueblito 52 B upper unit, very nice a little walk to the beach compared to the caribe section but very comfortable with nice remotely controlled air conditioning units and fans..Our stay in august was hot, and sleeping was a bit difficult but the rooms were still very comfortable. THe beds unlike what we have heard, were nice, firm but a bit pillowy on the top.. Bathrooms roomy and nice..Large tiled showers.. Patios-- large with two hammocks and if you are on the upper floors you get a nice ocean breeze... Disadvantage of an upper room is that with the high roof it is hard for the air conditioner to keep the room cool.. Lack of a fridge is a problem.. Bring a cooler and buy ice and drinks from wal-mart or the little store just down the street.. Drinks purchased from the bar or store are pricey but available.. Lack of lunch is a bit of problem.. You can either order from aventura restaurant or go out, or buy snacks and wait until supper.. We usually got up later, for breakfast which lasted from 7-10:30 and then just snacked on some crackers and food we had picked up from the wal-mart or mega. Yes they do have a wal-mart... Taxis-- Make sure to get the fare advice immediately from a reliable source... The drivers will definitely rip you off given the chance... Also if you are will to walk up to 10th rather than take the taxi directly from the Shangri Lato go downtown you will get at least a dollar or two cheaper rate... The door to hotel \"tourista service\" gets you a higher price...This tip was given to us by the hotel staff, and matters really only if you are using the taxis alot, but is nice to know... Grounds- Beautiful and always being worked on, staff is very hardworking, and if you didn't know about the hurricane the only evidence is the big piles of sand. Beach- As nice as everyone says...In a word \"beautiful\".. Amazing sand, gorgeous water, not crowded, and always palapas available.. A beautiful breeze kept it very nice even in the humid and hot summers of Playa.. Staff-- Excellent, restaurant, grounds, front desk, everyone was kind, friendly and accomodating... All in all if you want a relaxing vacation in a simply beautiful location, then the Shangrila is for you.. The food choices aren't like cruising or even a more expensive all inclusive, but they are definitely simple buty enjoyable, and if you want something more go out..... The Shangrila isn't about food, trust me its about having peace, quiet , tranquility and above all an amazing location which you will love....

We are already planning our next trip back. We booked our trip directly through the hotel based solely on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor (thank you!!!). We preferred that it was a small, beachy resort to a huge chain resort. While being relaxed, it was not too rustic (nice cold air conditioning & good service). The grounds were lush & beautiful. The staff was absolutely wonderful & we actually never once encountered a time-share salesperson. We really did like the food actually. We particularly loved the local dishes like slow cooked pork on banana leaves, and of course, the Mexican night (with the mariachi band) was great. We did not eat at the hotel every night though, because Playa del Carmen had so many interesting places that we wanted to check out. We were also thrilled that our end of the Avenida 5 strip was much more laid back and less touristy than the southern end near the Cozumel ferry. Our hope was to get away from a lot of that, while still feeling like there was a little civilization around to go play in. We felt we completely met this expectation. The beach at Shangri-La Caribe is hands down, the best beach in Playa del Carmen. The resort is directly on a large and immaculate beach and you are provided with plenty of loungers & shady palapas to relax under. When we passed the other beaches in town we were not impressed by the crowds, sandbags and boats anchored on shore. There is public beach access in the middle of Shangri-La\u2019s beach area but it is pretty small & it never once made a difference to us. It was never crowded like the other Playa beaches (which also had plenty of public access). If you need to see the beach traffic just check out the resort's web-cam. As others have said, a great tip is to purchase a disposable cooler at the store right up the road. Since the rooms have no refrigerators this was key to keeping our beer nice & chilly. If you need to, there is even a Wal-Mart that you can walk to (or take a cab to) if you have to really stock up on snacks, water rafts, beer or supplies. Bug spray is a big must. Lastly, we took 2 tours arranged through Shangri-La Caribe from Alderban Tours. The Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 tour was long and the driver had us a bit scared. The ruins were well worth it, but I think I\u2019d have rather rode in a nice safe bus than to be crammed in a scary little rattly van for 3 hours. The second tour to Tulum & Xel-ha was excellent- same van, but shorter ride. The all-inclusive at Xel-ha was worth it too.", "Date": "August 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cIdeal vacation spot!\u201d", "Author": "senoraohora", "ReviewID": "UR5580043", "Content": "We stayed at the Shangri-La Caribe for one week in late July/early August 2006.

We originally had plans to visit all the beautiful Mayan ruins, and snorkle the clear waters, but you know what? Once we arrived at our beachfront room with two wonderful hammocks, we ditched our plans and opted to swim and sun at one of the most beautiful beaches in Playa. I must say that both the positive and negative TripAdvisor remarks about this resort are right on the money. When we first arrived there, the resort's neighborhood, which is still recovering from the hurricanes, gave us some concern. But as soon as we pulled up to the resort, and saw that it was fully recovered from the weather, we relaxed and enjoyed ourselves. The beach is pure bliss, there are always plenty of palapas and chairs right on the water and the environment is serene, with little to no loud destractions. There is more of a \"fun in the sun\" place down the beach 5 min or so. They work hard to keep the beach clean. There was a small storm overnight that left lots of seaweed and it took about 24 hours to fully clean it (by hand, with wheelbarrows). If I had arrived just on that day, I would have been disappointed in the beach, but it was wonderful when the water cleared from the storm. It is perfect for swimming and there is a tiny reef, but serious snorklers can go across to Cozumel. The beach earns this facility the most points in my book (5 stars) Our room was spacious, with a king bed and beautiful talavera tile bathroom. It was always spotless. The bed was hard, and it had a loud plastic covering on the mattress that we didn't like very much. But we slept well. The air conditioner and ceiling fans in our room worked nicely. The decor is simple and lovely. Those looking for more of a \"resort\" with a more generic and upscale appearance may be slightly disappointed. We loved the absence of TV and phone. The first bottle of water in the room is free (1L), but won't be nearly enough to get you through the day. You have to pay for more water after that. We went to a convenience store (not the expensive gift shop on site) and bought water regularly and at a more reasonable price. I've stayed in places in Mexico where they provided 5gallon water and dispensers for free or a nominal charge and I think Shangri-La Caribe should consider offering free water to it's guests. It is a small gesture that would mean a lot and wouldn't cost them much. We didn't see one bug in our room the whole week (though be sure to bring bug spray for mosquitos at dawn and dusk when you are outside) The rooms could use a comfort and convenience makeover just a bit. Overall, we were satisfied with the interior of our room, but we aren't particularly picky. Our room was on the ground floor and faced the beautiful water (about 15 ft. away). There were two hammocks from which you can alternately snooze, read and stare out at a million shades of blue. At night we laid out there and watched the moon rise over the water and listened to the waves. This was heaven. (Room and ammenities 2.5 stars, porch and view 5 stars) Food and drinks were fine for us. Some good selections and some mediocre. The breakfast is wonderful with lots of fresh fruit and made-to order hot entres. At dinner you are given 2 choices for a main dish. One meat, one fish. I liked the Yucatan feel of the food, but sometimes I ended up wishing I'd ordered the other thing. But overall, no complaints. There were 2 buffet dinners when we were there and I will say that the presentation was beautiful and not at all like a cafeteria. The ambiance was romantic in the open-air dining structure, dim, with candles. There were always plenty of tables, set apart for maximum privacy. Be sure to use bug spray before going to dinner. We weren't the only creatures dining. (Breakfast - 5 stars, Dinner 3.5 -4 stars) The grounds are simple and beautiful. The structures are charming and really give you the feel of an old-world tropical vacation. Although there were a few families, for the most part this is a very romantic, couples-oriented resort. There isn't anything fancy for the kids, though the ones I saw were having a blast (peacefully) The pools are simple and small, but most people were out on the beach, so they were never crowded and there was always a chair. A few visitors sunbathed topless. (Surroundings: 4.5 stars) We enjoyed very much taking the short 10 min walk up the beach to Avenida 5 and all the shops and restaurants. Every day we went in for lunch and watched the World Cup. We ate lunch at the resort one of the days, but it wasn't great and there are some really neat places to explore in town. I can't think of a resort with a more perfect combination of seclusion and convenience. (Convenience:privacy 5 stars) As many of the previous reviewers have mentioned, there are some very agressive time share folks who will try to lure you to them with promises of free tequila and cash for shopping. If you value your time, come up with any excuse to brush them off (we told them we had an appointment in town). We managed to avoid the presentation, but it was tiresome to make the effort to brush them off every time we ventured into the lobby. This was a very negative mark on the hotel and the most unpleasant aspect of staying there by far. They have no way of remembering who has brushed them off, so you must face these people time and again. The solution would be to provide information in the room for people to read and let those who are interested in the \"perks\" come forward. We left this feedback as we were leaving. I'm not saying it ruined our trip in any way because it is easy to avoid the lobby. (1 star) Staff are very friendly and deserve tips for excellent service. Be sure to tip a little something! We arranged for airport transfers through the hotel and it worked perfectly. The driver met us at the airport holding up a sign and we never had to wait. It was great to have this aspect of the trip run so smoothly. I recommend this service. (Staff: 5 stars) Just a note on the weather in June, in case you're planning to be there at that time. It clouded up and may have sprinkled a couple of times, but most of the rain fell during the night or only briefly in the day. There was a wonderful, steady breeze blowing off the water and we kept quite cool the entire time we were outside near the beach. In town is another story - it gets quite hot and sticky and doesn't get the ocean breezes. You might want to plan your shopping for early in the day, then go back to the hotel for a refreshing swim in the ocean or pool and enjoy the breezes. Like I said, we probably weren't the typical turists because we ended up just relaxing and not going anywhere. We felt like Shangri-La Caribe was the perfect place for us to unwind and enjoy each other's company. It was a wonderful experience and we will certainly be back in the future.", "Date": "June 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNot bad, but...\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5391001", "Content": "Reasonable rooms, nice service, and it's on the beach but... 1) The included meals aren't particular good.

The hotel was fully booked for the easter holidays. We had a stand alone ocean front cabana for 4 nights and a standard room for 1. It was worth the money for the ocean front cabana. The second room we had was half way back into the resort in the Caribe section. The room was much smaller, amd much noisier due to the high density buildings. My one gripe is the Ocean front cabana was supposed to have queen beds, and they were doubles. The beach is lovely, the swimming is good and gentle (very small waves one foot high). Snorkeling is possible right off the beach to the north, and off the point to the north, but it is pretty poor. The 2 pools are small but nice. There are plenty of beach chairs to go around, even when the resort is full. We had no trouble with beach towels, there were guards watching day and night. The resort is well maintained, apparently the hurricane did a lot of damage to the vegetation, but if you didn't see pictures of the before, you wouldnt't know the difference. There is a big high rise being build directly behind the Aventura section, I woulnd't want to be in the back row right next to that. The map doesn't show clearly, but there is a public road and beach access that cuts right through the property, dividing the Caribe and Aventura sections. It just means the resort is not so pri vate or enclosed as you might think. The Shangri la is probably a 15 min hot walk to town, either along the beach or on the roads. WE drove in once, our teenagers never went. A bit too touristy for us, and if you don't like bars there didn't seem any reason to go. The food is good, sometimes very good, it you don't expect 5 star, you will be satisifed. The Mexican buffet was fun and good. The staff everywhere was helpful, and friendly.

A couple of tips if you stay here: Ask to opt out of the \"dinner included\" plan when you make your reservations. I didn't know it was an option to opt out, but another couple we met at the Shangri La did this. the dinner is remarkably bad, and breakfast is free to everyone anyways. You get a little discount (i think $30 or so per night), but unless you LOVE eating mall food everyday, you'll be better off. there are many cool restaurants to try in downtown PDC, so take a walk down fifth avenue and kill some time looking at the menus and finding a restaurant to eat at. don't lock yourself into eating at the hotel every night by doing the dinner included plan, especially since you can opt out. Second, try and make it to the breakfast each morning - though dinner is terrible, breakfast is surprisingly decent by comparison. Again, breakfast is free even if you opt out of the dinner plan, so you can't lose. Third, if you're going to drink beer, bring an individual beer cozy/wrap. It is HOT, and your drinks get warm very quickly. I read this tip in this forum before my trip but didn't listen. The second half of every beer I drank for the entire trip was warm. Fourth, BRING INSECT REPELLANT, especially if you're there between may through October. I can't speak for other areas or resorts at PDC, but there were a LOT of mosquitos at this resort (i'm sure they are everywhere during this time of year though). It was HILARIOUS to see all these people with dozens of giant red welts on their legs at the hotel. Luckily, I read a tip to bring repellant, and had zero bites. Finally, IF YOU HAVE KIDS THAT CAN'T SWIM, bring floatation devices (like those dorky inflatable arm things or doughnuts). The 2 pools on site are small, like glorified kiddie pools, but they are surprisingly deep! Only half of one of the pools is 3 foot deep or less, and that section amounts to an area of about 100-200 sq.ft. If you're kid can't swim, s/he will have very little space to wade around in at the pool without a floaty thing. With respect to the property itself, it is located about 3 blocks north from the start of the busy downtown area of PDC (5th street) where most of the shops and restaurants are located. Since the stretch of beach that the Shangri-La is located on is a few blocks from downtown Playa, the beach is not too crowded. Also, even though the hotel was at capacity, we had no problems getting a palapa on the beach (a giant thatch sun-shade/umbrella), and in fact there were many empty ones. all the rooms are in detached 2 story bungalows. They all have a large, covered porch with hammocks and large rooms. One thing we notced was that there were no drawers or shelves in the rooms - there was a closet to hang clothes, but we had to keep our underwear and other clothing in our suitcases because there was no where else to put them except the floor of the closet. Also, none of the rooms have telephones or televisions. The a/c is on the noisy side, but it works fine. I thought the services were kind of primitive - no phones (if you want to call in for a wake up call or something) and there are no clocks in the rooms. Drink and food service on the beach and pool areas are almost non existent. If you want a drink, you have to get it yourself. All in all, it is a nice place and worth the $175 per night or so we spent staying there. It isn't the 4 seasons resort, but it isn't a motel 6 either. The property in and of itself is nothing special, but what separates it from the dozens of other resorts in the area is that it is close to downtown playa, but still has no crowds at the beach. for this reason alone, I would return to the shangrila and recommend it.", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Twinsburg, OH", "Title": "\u201cShangri-la Caribe fabulous find!\u201d", "Author": "lizajane67", "ReviewID": "UR5206012", "Content": "My family and I visited Mexico for the first time last June.

There were a few things I was surprised about...the hot tub's jets were all broken, making the hot tub less than enjoyable. This problem was not fixed during our 7 day stay and I suspect will never be. I'm surprised a resort of this caliber would negelct the issue...Also, we had a huge bug problem in our bungalow. I was certainly understanding of this considering the bungalows have thatched roofs and sit on piles of sand, however, every day our bathroom floor and shower walls were covered in little mounds of ants. I also noticed quite a few other little bugs crawling in and out of the small cracks in the walls. I was moderately bothered by this but I can see how many people would be severely unhappy with sharing their room with a diverse community of bugs 24/7. And the bugs did get bigger; one evening as I was looking for something in my suitcase, I felt something land on the back of my neck. I brushed my neck off, only to watch a large cockroach come falling off of me. Now this definitely did disgust/disturb me. Fortunately, it was an isolated incident, as I didn't meet any more cucarachas the rest of our trip. No refrigerador is also quite inconvenient in hot weather, as you need to drink plenty of water and the hotel's water is not purified.

Our room was on the Aventura side, room 11P. As we approached across a very sandy walkway, it looked to be the room absolutely closest to a sizeable four-story office/retail building going up probably 30 feet behind it. Hammers, beeping front loaders, falling wood--pretty much a total bummer based on what I had anticipated from this hotel. HOWEVER, the back wall of our room muffled the noise almost totally, and the second floor (15' x 15') balcony was super pleasant because of the constant breeze and the sound of the sea. What I thought was going to be a disaster ended up not mattering much at all. In fact, for the second leg of our stay (after a three-day trip to Chichen Itza), we requested the same room! The balcony was just lovely, with two hammocks and chairs. Our room was very clean, with tile floors and (blissfully) no TV. It was hot--so the AC was a welcome thing at certain times. Open windows were lovely, most of the time. The lack of telephone was an actual inconvenience because we had friends staying next door at Las Palapas and had to hike over to communicate with them. And restaurant reservations had to be made at the front desk phone. The staff were universally friendly and helpful with any request we made. Breakfast: great. Dinner: felt like we were on the Love Boat. Not terrible, but after a insanely tasty dinner in Playa at Yaxche, we knew there was much better food to be found elsewhere. Our two boys loved the beach, the pool, the sweet woman at the pottery-painting stall, the ping pong, and the billiard tables. Apparently the (beautiful) beach got a lot deeper after hurricane Wilma, because I watched four guys thatching a new second row of palapas one day. Fascinating to see how they do it. Lounge chairs were always available, and you could easily spend all week gazing at the spectacular blue water. The dive shop on the beach was extremely friendly and actually steered us AWAY from a snorkeling trip with the boys because the surf was too choppy. Very impressed at their honesty. My advice is to stay away from the Aventura side for the next months because of the construction. But if you do end up there, it really isn't the disaster you think it will be. In general, second floor rooms seemed to have more privacy--at least ours did. This is a great place to stay--and after we walked south on the beach to see what other hotels looked like, we realized that Shangri-la Caribe really is the loveliest beach in town.

This was our second stay at the hotel, and I can't think of a reason to go anywhere else for a beach vacation. The hotel offers a perfect balance of great service, absolutely gorgeous beach, all-you-need in a room, delicious food options, privacy and reasonable price. There are always seats available on the beach (and this is during a relatively high season), and the clarity of water and fine sand are exactly as from a Caribbean vacation poster. The place may be romantic for couples but also very friendly to families with kids, and is a short walking distance from downtown where there are numerous going-out options. It has much more of an authentic Mexican feel than you would get in a large all-inclusive in Riviera Maya. The food was quite good. The breakfast may seem repetitive if you stay for a longer period but you can alternate between several hot options, fruit, cereal and bakery. My favorite was the fruit and the variety was probably as good as you can get anywhere in Mexico. The dinner was generally outstanding, our favorite was parrillada buffet (grilled meat), however the Mexican buffet night was just good (the choices seem to have gotten simpler since last year). Overall, I would say the quality of food is superior to what you find in a normal all-inclusive hotel. And definitely, the quality of drinks is superior since these are not included in the dinner price and you can order quite good wine from the list.

The overall tone is relaxed and friendly, and the resort never felt crowded.

I surprised my husband with a trip there for his 40th birthday. I am also 5 months pregnant, so this was also a needed getaway before staying up for a year with a new little one! The Shangri-La turned out to be very quaint and above all, quiet. We were awakened by a songbird every morning, and could hear the delicious crashing of the waves every night. We had a beachfront cabana, 3C, and it was incredible to look out the window every morning and see the gorgeous turquoise ocean and white beaches. We need to retire this way someday! The hammocks on the front porch were dreams come true...just swaying in the breeze, looking at the ocean and reading a great book had us straight in heaven!! You can even order lunch and drinks right there! HEAVEN. Since we left Super Bowl day, we were actually able to catch the game in the beach bar (we could then tell who all the Americans were at the hotel!), and it was wonderful. I very much enjoyed the strong European and Canadian flair that Playa had - even though they sure smoke a lot! People in general were very nice. Breakfast and Dinner are included with your room price, which made it very convenient, and took some pain out of the final bill (that and I couldn't drink, of course!). The food was very good, with some nights delicious buffets, and then others, a choice of four-course meal, including a soup, appetizer, main course, and dessert. My fave dessert was the little \"Mexican Creme Puffs\". They were little round chocolate eclairs! Breakfasts were very good, in my opinion - the fruit and yogurt were yummy, as well as the hot breakfast choices. The staff of the hotel were top notch, and very helpful. A server, Van, was our favorite...always joking and very sweet. He was a ray of sunlight every day. The beaches and the water were incredible! The salt water and the sun kissed us many times, we felt like new people. I was nervous about being pregnant and getting sick from something, but as long as you brush your teeth with the bottled water only, you are OK. I was even able to eat the fruit buffet in the morning, and drink ice water because all water served is purified. I never got sick once. If you stay in the tourist zones, you will be fine. Even in town on 5th Avenue, which is a short 10 minute walk away, the food and drink were top-notch. I was surprised at how big the area was and how diverse the shops on 5th in Playa were.

We flew to Mexico City, where we hired a car and slowly travelled through Mexico to the Yucatan peninsula staying in 8 different hotels until we finally spent 8 glorious days and nights at Shangri-la in Playa del Carmen. We finished our vacation with 4 days & nights at the AI Iberostar Quetzal. Travelling with our children (aged 6, 8 & 11), I carefully selected our hotels, but although they were all nice, none came close to the magical experience of Shangri la. We had originally booked a Penthouse Suite for us and an ocean view room for the kids which I had asked to be right next to the suite. As we arrived just 5 days after the hurricane, all the Penthouse suites had been damaged and so we were put in a beachfront cabana (31) on the Aventura side with our kids in another right next to us (32). The room we had really made the vacation, it was amazing, huge, right on the beach shaded by palm trees with a very large veranda. The ceiling was incredible, it had a very big bathroom and was spotlessly clean. We also had the best towel art we experienced during our entire vacation. I didn't find the bed to be any harder than any other I slept in in Mexico. I will never forget the sound of the ocean waves, lulling me to sleep each night - wonderful! As for the food, I had read other reviews and wasn't expecting too much. I was pleasantly surprised. We are from Switzerland right near the French border and are used to French cuisine. I found the food to be very tasty and varied and far better than at any of the other hotels we stayed in. My kids are still talking about Ivan, our waiter, who was wonderful and even taught them a few magic tricks. The staff were all fantastic, I was so impressed by the number of employees and how hard everyone worked to get the place up and running again after the hurricane. 4 penthouse roofs were completely redone during our stay and each day that passed saw immense improvement to the grounds. We were all very sad to leave Shangri la, including the children. I had booked the Iberostar as I was worried that the kids would be a little bored after 8 days with not much activities. How wrong I was, they loved playing ping pong and pool at the Shangri la bar and had made several friends amongst the very international clientele (particularly lots of French). Going to the Iberostar was a bit of a shock after Shangri la. It was our first experience of an AI and although it was more luxurious, we found it to be far too crowded and noisy and it lacked the personalized service we had loved at Shangri la. Also to have to hunt down transits amongst rows and rows after the beautiful and empty beach at Shangri la was very annoying. If we went back to Playa del Carmen we would spend our entire vacation at Shangri la without a doubt. Having said that, the beachfront cabana definitely added a huge plus to our vacation and can't compare with some of the other smaller, less private rooms in other sections.

The beaches, property, and character of the palapas was everything we could have asked for. The staff were all so kind and helpful, and always tried to accomodate our needs. The feel of Shangri la is simple relaxation! How great it was to lay in our hammacks or just sit out on the veranda enjoying the views- or of course, we could relax on the beach. We were beachfront -and we couldn't have been happier! I highly recommend spending the extra dollars for this. We had 33P, and I would request that palapa if you can. It was the perfect location, and seemed to have the most beach space. Our room was wonderful, although the beds really are HARD. It takes a little getting used to. The palapa rooms have so much character and personality- that they make up for the the few ammenities and luxury that a hotel offers. The food was o.k. - not fabulous, but not bad. It was great having both breakfast and dinner included in the price - and as most other reviews expressed - the breakfast was the best. We went down to Shangri-La to get married on the beach - and the entire experience exceeded my hopes and dreams. They (Beatriz!) handled everything - so we were able to just enjoy the end result. I couldn't have been happier. We had about 38 guests with us, and everyone had a wonderful time- and enjoyed their stay. I couldn't have asked for a more beautiful wedding. Although I had no idea what my flowers were going to look like, what the wedding cake was going to look like, or what we were having for our wedding dinner.... it was all great - and I was pleasantly surprised with everything. If you're looking for a luxury hotel with all the ammenities, this would not be the place for you... no tv's, no telephones in the room... but if you're looking for a unique, charming, and special place to relax on an incredibly beautiful beach without the crowds- where noone wears a watch - this is the place! This truly is the most beautiful beach front that we visited, and after walking down the beach to find nothing but crowds, we were amazed at how quiet and secluded Shangri la was. We will definitely be back, and truly enjoyed our time there. We left the day of Hurricane Emily - and we hope the resort is back up and running quickly.

The hotel has a wide beach area, with plenty of shady palapas and palm trees. We stayed in a \"garden view\" room in the Caribe section. The room had a palapa roof, as it was on the second floor, and was in the 3rd row of bungalows from the water. We had a partial ocean view, and we preferred the Caribe area because the beachfront and water were better, and the bungalows only had 1 upper and 1 lower unit in each. Our room was about a 20 second walk from our beach chairs and palapa. The room was relatively spacious, although the bathroom was small. A great improvement would be the addition of small fridges for the rooms. All the rooms in this section of the hotel had air conditioning, as far as we could tell. The breakfast and dinner were more than adequate, but nothing too memorable. The service in the restaurants was very good. Try the french toast or omelets at breakfast. If the quality of the beach and water are very important to you, this is the place. We walked a few hundred yards south to the Puerto Real and Gran Puerto resorts, and were appalled at how crowded their small beach area was, and how rocky and full of seaweed the water was.

If you want a big, canned all-inclusive experience this isn't the place for you. There are places we've gone where an all-inclusive was worth it, Playa del Carmen isn't one of them. The town is worth frequenting so if you're the active type don't plant yourself at the resort, visit the town in the afternoons and evenings. Shangri-la, the layout and landscaping of the resort is excellent...it's a peaceful place. The pools are not as big as they seem in pictures, but were never crowded. During our stay the resort was 100% occupied, but it felt only half full...which I've been told is by design. Staff is friendly and helpful. Tip $2-3 for the maid/day and at meals. Also drop $1 for other services (drinks, etc). You'll be glad you did and they deserve it. The beach front at Shangli-la is the best in Playa del Carmen. We walked up and down and into the city and there isn't a more beautiful and peaceful stretch around. The difference is noticeable. If you aren't interested in SCUBA or snorkeling, but want to see some fish there is enough coral to keep you occupied about 15 feet off the beach front. The food (breakfast and dinner is included) is decent. Breakfast is better, but we also enjoyed the non-buffet dinner days. Don't expect excellent food, but it wasn't bad and the service was good. If you choose to have lunch at the resort, the portions are huge. You may want to split the meal among two people. We ate in town for all but two dinners and a lunch. The bar area is fine enough for the day, but pretty dead at night (go into town). Happy hour is 2 drinks for the price of one not half price off the drinks. Rooms were good. We were in a bungalow which was large, had 2 queen beds, a separate seating area indoors, a front porch (2 hammocks). Best part, we were 5 feet from the pool area and 15 feet from the beach. Most of the bungalows were very well situated. It took the AC about 4 hours to really cool the place down, but with the high, thatched room that is expected. Once it was cool, it stayed pleasant throughout the trip. We met people with garden view rooms who were not happy at all. You've been warned. This resort emphasizes rustic elegance so no TV, no telephone, no mini-bar in the rooms. We didn't miss the first two, but a mini-bar to store some food and drinks would have been nice. You can buy a cheap cooler and some ice at the convenience store a couple blocks away if you want to store drinks, food. Taxi to Playa is no cheaper if you order one from the front desk or walk street side. It will be $3. That said, we negotiated a trip to CUN airport for $30 with an individual driver (the going rate was $50). Don't take a taxi or a group van from CUN to Playa. Take the bus to Playa and a cab to the resort. It costs $7 pp (ticket stand is located to the right as you exit the airport), than $3 for the taxi. Compared to a shuttle bus, it will save you time since you don't have to stop to drop the other passengers, etc. Also, will cost about 1/3 the price. We took a shuttle bus...wish we didn't. See more of Playa, walk to town via the beach and back to the resort via the road at least once. Plenty to see, stores, restaurants, bars, etc. In general the food and drinks are priced similar to what you would pay in the States, but bargains are to be had by walking a block or two off the main drag. Random stuff: Beach towels seem to go early in the AM so make sure you get a fresh set before breakfast. The night before you leave ask the front desk to pack you a breakfast to go if you're leaving in the early AM.

This is a long review but I just can\u2019t say enough great things about this place, so here goes: Rooms: We stayed in 32 Playa, a beach front bungalow and I couldn't have asked for a better location and room on the resort. When we walked out we were smack dab in the middle of the pool (about 10 feet) and the beach (again 10 feet). Often times we found ourselves lounging in the hammocks and just watching the ocean in front of us\u2026that was the best! Several previous reviews stated that this bungalow didn't have AC but when we arrived there was one in the room. I think all of the rooms are now equipped with an AC unit, which is tremendously good news, considering how hot and humid it is in PDC. At night, our room was quite chilly between the AC and fan blowing full speed, very comfy. I will say though, the beds are pretty hard but that's such a minor factor considering you're in such a beautiful setting. We met another couple at the resort who were given a Garden View Puebolito room and absolutely hated it. They said it was very small and clausterphobic, view wasn\u2019t that nice and the ceiling was very constricting. I would highly recommend a Superior Garden View or higher grade during your stay and if you can, definitely go with 32 or 31 Playa Beach bungalows. The Aventura Playa side is newer. Also, a note, there are NO tv's, radios or phones in the room. We took our laptop and a couple of movies, which worked out great. On the nights that we were too tired to go into town, we popped in our DVD's and hung out in the room. We had a wireless card and were able to get a connection, weak but good enough to go on the internet and check emails at the least. Staff: The staff was wonderful. I wanted to practice my Spanish since I'm currently taking classes here in Houston, and when I mentioned this any of the staff, they were constantly encouraged me to speak to them and would teach me new ways to say certain things. Remember that most people in Mexico make next to nothing so even a $1 tip goes a long way. We always left a couple of bucks in the room for the maid and were rewarded with an exceptionally clean room and great towel art. Beach: The Shangri La beach, in my opinion, is by far the best stretch of beach in PDC. We walked along the coast to some of the big AI beaches, and they were small, crowded and somewhat dirty. Ours was very clean, peaceful, romantic and simply magnificent (I would go on, but you get the idea). The water was crystal blue and sands were breathtakingly white during high noon. Food: The breakfast buffets were great every morning. Don\u2019t expect a lot of variety. What they do serve is an array of fruits, delicious pastries and the BEST hashbrowns. I think I inhaled those suckers every morning. They also have a variety of different egg dishes you can have made to order every morning and they were muy delicioso! We tried a different one every day. The lunch at the resort restaurant is over priced and not worth it. I would highly recommend venturing into town to try some of the local restaurant. Avenida 5 is a brisk 10 minute walk along the beach or a mere $3 cab ride. After my first day of walking and nearly melting in the heat, we opted to cab it every time. Some great restaurants to try are Babes (a great and cheap noodle place), Siam (another make your own noodle place) and Tango Taco. We had dinner at the resort 3 nights and ate in town one night. Dinner was actually pretty good. There are some who just hate the food, but honestly I think these people are very picky and expect gourmet meals at a 4 star hotel buffet. A word of advice: Caribbean resort food in general is NEVER spectacular, especially if it\u2019s in buffet form. Food is generally more bland and they make it to accommodate several hundred people\u2019s taste. Also, every evening they had happy hour from 5:00 to 6:00. You get 2 drinks for the price of one. I can\u2019t tell you how many pina coladas I had. They make the best ones. In conclusion, if you\u2019re looking for a huge, packed All-Inclusive with a set group of restaurants and tons of activities, avoid Shangri La. But if you\u2019re looking for a romantic, peaceful and charming get away with almost a Robinson Carusoe feel to it, then definitely come to Shangri La Caribe.

The restaurant that is open for lunch serves great tacos and fajitas. The one thing to be warned about is the drive to the resort is quite misleading. Although the resort appears to be building a new entrance off a nicer road, the current entrance is situated on a dirt road and the drive there certainly takes you through the less desirable part of Playa del Carmen. We both got a little nervous on the drive, but it quickly vanished once we checked in.

We spent at least 2 hours every night, swinging in the hammocks, reading, listening to music. By day, we lounged in the chairs on the beach. As for the food, we agree with the other reviews. The breakfast was good but the dinners were just mediocre. Not terrible mind you, just not fabulous. We ate 3 dinners at the hotel and 3 elsewhere.

We had lunch twice (try the mushroom and cactus empanadas) and dinner once. It was amazing! Quite affordable. Fabulous atmosphere. Great staff. As for the complaints about construction, perhaps it would help to keep in mind that these beautiful seaside resorts cannot be built silently when no one is around.

The atmosphere is laid-back fun, and accepting, with a wide variety of people using that strip of beach, including families, older, younger folks, topless sunbathers, clothed sunbathers, international tourists, and Mexican families. The pools and ambience at the Shangri-La are also excellent. The staff make an all-out effort to be enthusiastically helpful, and often succeed in being really funny. I agree with other reviews that the breakfast is very good, the dinner just mediocre, but the dinner buffet somewhat better. One day, we spent the afternoon on the front porch of our cabana, and someone came around to ask if we'd like to be served lunch or drinks. What a treat! On a morning when we were leaving at 7:20 am for a tour, before the beginning of breakfast, the staff packed a boxed breakfast for us. They offer massages in an open air cabana right on the property, and there is a dive shop in the hotel (which launches from the Shangri-La beach), as well as an excellent gift shop. All this made for a very relaxing stay. We could walk into town or take trips whenever we wanted, but didn't have to leave the hotel if we wanted a low-key day. I think the Shangri-La is in a terrific location close to town, but does not suffer from any of the crowding or meat-market atmosphere of some of the other hotels. The great advantage of this hotel is that you can stay right on the beach in a self-contained cabana. There are other hotel rooms off the beach, which seemed fine, but I would always stay on the oceanfront at this hotel.

The room was very small, and faced a fence, with the other side of the fence being a construction site. It was horrible. Although they agreed to refund us the price difference after several rounds of arguing, I would have rather had the beach view, as this was one of the selling points for Shangri La. There is construction going on all around the hotel. It is noisy and just overall not very nice. The best thing we did was to rent a car and drive up the coast to Akumal.

The Bad - we did not like the food at all. the breakfast buffet is ok, but it may take several times to get your eggs cooked all the way through. rolls/ bread/etc taste like the kind you get from Costco. the dinner was really bad - we each tried different dishes like pasta, meat, soup, etc. and we were reminded of airplane food. we walked into town for dinner and found good food. we may be a little biased being from san francisco, but we didn't think it was acceptable. as others said, hotel is almost impossible to find with construction going on in front. front desk staff is not very helpful. we were told at 4:30 in the afternoon that it was too late to get a beachtowel because the dive shop was closed - we would have to wait until the morning. checkout took 25 minutes because there was only one person at the desk. the morning of checkout, we came back to our room about 45 minutes before check out time. the maids moved all of our things off of the beds, stripped the linens and left the beds bare, and taken the towels - not cool. overall, a nice place if you want a nice, relaxing family vacation. not a good place if you are picky about food, expect great service, or are concerned about taking a group of people to a resort as your guests.", "Date": "March 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colchester, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Family Vacation\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3212794", "Content": "We went to Shangri La Caribe with our extended family last Christmas.

The hotel is small enough that you become familiar with the other families there. The beach is beautiful and not at all crowded. The staff is wonderful, and helped us with the several outside activities we did - like trips to Xel-ha, special dinners in Playa del Carmen, snorkling trips, etc. The waiters at breakfast and dinner knew our kids by name and often sat down to play with them.

After a few days they came in with bulldozers and smoothed out most of the sand but left the pile of trash and rocks like it belonged there. The good things: the ocean view from the breakfast room and pool area was spectacular. I loved the towel art; every day our fresh towels were arranged on the bed in the shapes of birds - very unique. There is a fabulous collection of palm trees on the beach - most other resorts in the area had none. I thought the food was quite good and the dining hall was exotic. But in general the place looked very 1970's, in desperate need of a makeover. We did a lot of walking in to town - Shangri-La is far from the action, so it's quiet but a long hike. Our weather was persistently windy. We were told that the best weather month for visiting the area is May. Oh, another thing we liked is that both the resort and Playa del Carmen attract a very international crowd.

Very clean, long, and the water has hardly any rocks or sea grass. Although they are a bit more expensive, I would suggest staying in one of the beachfront palapas. They are very spacious, clean, and have a view to die for. Our only complaint , was the microscopic bugs we had twice in our room in the morning. This was mostly our fault - due to some food we had left on the table overnight. You have to expect a chance of bugs with a room with a thatched roof, and directly on the sand. But overall, it really wasn't a problem. In addition, the maid service was awesome. The maid we had spent at least 2 hours on our room each day.

My reasons: the beach, the private rooms, the balcony hammocks(loved those!), and the accessiblity to 5th Ave. Shangri La Caribe is located of one of the most beautiful stretches of beach i have visited (and we've been to a few so far including Tahiti, Hawaii,Aruba, St John, St Lucia) The sand is the perfect texture, the ocean is beautiful turquoise. We loved the grounds, they were clean with litttle pathways around each section leading to the different areas. The Housekeeping staff and all the staff were top notch. Everyone was friendly and accomodating. ROOM: we stayed in the just newly built Garden View Deluxe suites(#54-65) right next to the pool. It was a simple very clean room with a hard king bed, closets and a mexican tiled bathroom (one sink, open shower with pretty low water pressure) The best part were the Hammocks on the Terrace, we brought speakers for our Ipod and listened to relaxing music every morning and evening on our hammocks. FOOD: Breakfast was always delicious. Choice of very good mexican or american eggs. I always had the Motelenos Eggs (crispy tortilla with eggs on top, topped with tomato sauce and bits of ham and peas...yum!) there was also a buffet of fresh fruit, juices, yogurt, cheese, sweet rolls and pastries, oatmeal, cereal. We ate lunch and dinner in town every night (aside from the hotels Sunday Mexican Feast which was good) DO NOT MISS Babes noodle shop, a thai restaurant with the best food in all if playa, even though it isn't mexican food, also try the Mojito there, top notch! Il Oasis for shrimp and crab tacos, Yaxche for Mayan food (pricey though), and try the tacos Al Pastor anywhere! POOLS: We had some very breezy days, so the pools were to cold for my taste, spent alot of time in the jacuzzi where we always grabbed a louge chair and read in the sun. BEACH: as stated, the beach is perfect. white soft sand with hardly a rock or seaweed in sight, with perfect turquoise water. We had a great time in the water. The outside feb temps were ~80. we walked up and down the beach, which looked long but wasn't. We stopped by Mamitas Beach Club, very cute, beds on the beach for sunning with relaxing music playing and a beach bar. BAR: saw a famous face here! that was fun. The happy hour from 5-6p is great, 2 for 1 drinks. Try the Caipiranha (lime, sugar, rum) - so refreshing. We loved the swings at the bar!! INTERNET: didn't use it here but it is cheaper here than on 5th. only $3 for one hour. And there are phones if you need them MASSAGE: an open hut right in the middle of the grounds housed 2 massage beds, only $60 for one hour of bliss, you can hear the ocean as they knead away your stresses. I had 2 within 5 days, one with a pretty french woman(name?) she was excellent, and one with Blanca which was good. Her husband Gabriel also does them. 5th Ave: The main pedestrian walkway in Playa del carmen. It is a short walk, but we always took a cab ($3 each way) We walked up and down 5th every afternoon and evening. There is so much people watching, great cute shops(for the shopaholic in me) as well as drugstores, souvenir shops, dessert spots. The bars at night are great (reminiscent of South Beach) Have a drink at DESEO's rooftop bar, and check out BLUE PARROT on the beach at night. Minor Complaints: the bad was Hard, but we survived. The shower pressure was low, but we did fine. Since we were in the newer section we didn't have any other furniture aside from the bed. we would have liked an extra bedside table or desk for all of our crap. Lastly, a complaint about myself, i continually read not to bring any fancy clothes or heels, but didn't listen. This place is casual, flip flops are good anywhere. All in all a perfect vacation of relaxation and fun. it was nice to have the options of eating and bar hopping of 5th Ave at night after hours of nothing all day.

We traveled with 2 small children who had the best time of their lives. My husband and I did too - so you know it was perfect! Our room was right on the beach (ocean-view, caribe section) so we could still enjoy the ocean during nap times. My husband I enjoyed cocktails on our patio while the kids dug 3 feet off to the side. My 2 year old preferred swimming in the pool and we used both of them. Plenty of steps and shallow water areas to keep her happy as a clam. We are not organized activity types and prefer low-key, upscale accommodations. This hotel fit the bill. This hotel is small and that allowed us to meet other families with kids. We saw them at meals and our kids met friends to play with (allowing adults more free time!) Shangri-la is full of couples and young families. It is not a singles scene and there were not a lot of older kids. The rec room has pool and ping pong tables and also a paint-your-own pottery which my 4 year old loved. There are wooden swings at the bar which were fun too! The beach is gorgeous and stretches for miles with wide white sandy expanses. Walking on the beach is EXTREMELY popular. This allows for ample people watching and did not seem to bother the kids in the least. People just stepped around their castles and trucks. The water was turquoise and calm. We took our 4 year old out in a sea kayak and also rented boogie boards from the dive shop. His favorite activity though was playing in the sand with his shovels and trucks. The beach was quiet and very relaxing. Lots of shade and we never had trouble finding lounge chairs. The rooms were simple and kept very clean. No TV's and no phones - we didn't even notice. The patios were outstanding with hammocks and a table and chairs. Meals were excellent. Breakfast and dinner are included. Breakfast is a continental buffet with hot items like pancakes and bacon. Excellent!!! We only ate dinner at the hotel 2 nights. My only complaint about this trip is dinner. Dinner starts at 7:30!! It is too late and my husband and I were starving before it started - the kids simply could not make it that late. There are no appetizers available beforehand. We got PB&J for the room and still found that dinner was too late. So we went into town - which was fantastic every time we went. There is a yoga studio across the street and I went to a class attended by tourists and locals alike. It was in Spanish and a pretty cool experience. Travel Notes: If you are driving to this hotel, just plan on getting lost the first time. Even armed with a map and directions it took 45 minutes to find it. The streets in this section of town are not marked and this hotel is not on a street anyway. It is on the beach. They are also doing construction up the street from the entrance and we actually had to move a construction barrier to drive down the sandy \"street.\" We asked at least 5 people before I went into another hotel and pulled a worker out to practically walk us there. Everyone I spoke to at the hotel had the same experience - it is kind of a joke there. But once you find it you will know Playa a lot better and it is definitely worth it! Also - bring more cash than you think you need. The dive shop, gift shop and pottery places, even though located at the hotel, do not allow you to charge to your room. Cash only. We ran out and it was kind of a pain to get to an ATM.", "Date": "February 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle, wa", "Title": "\u201cPARADISE FOUND!!\u201d", "Author": "relaxedgirl", "ReviewID": "UR3072710", "Content": "I just spent 16 days at Shangri La.

It would suit anyone except those not wanting to climb about 45 stairs. No big effort and it helped to work off all of the beer calories. The food was good and plentiful. I am a bit of a foodie and love variety, so we ate out 5 of the 7 nights during our stay. Do not miss the restaurants Babe's (Thai) or Yaxche (Mayan), very good!

We stayed in the garden view caribe (18) and had a/c although we didn't need it except for the first night when there was an all night party going on about two blocks away from the resort. It must have kept the north part of Playa awake so this was not the resort's fault.

As a point of reference, we've been to Hawaii 9 times (Oahu, Kaui, and Maui), Puerto Vallarta, and Ixtapa. Playa del Carmen hands down is the best so far. And Shagri-La Caribe exceeded our expectations. We were touring the Yucatan for nine days in August and unfortunately only stayed 4 days and 3 nights at this resort (August 17th to 20th). We will return and stay a least a week. We were in bungalow #5 on the Caribe side. We loved our bungalow (which happens to be the closest one to the water). Didn't need AC even in August. The bungalow was exceptionally clean and the beds were a little firm but a minor downside to paradise found. The best beach in the whole Yucatan. (Skip Cancun; either the ocean's too rough on the Carribean side or too shallow facing Isla Mujeres). Price- An absolute bargain since a hearty breakfast and full course dinner (except for drinks at dinner) comes with your rate. Also tax is included. Once you've stayed in Cancun, you'll realize what a bargain Shangri-La is. Beach - White sand. Coconut trees. Blue, warm, clear water. Other perks - Two hammocks on your porch, excellent lounging and people watching. Very diverse clientelles which we love. Service - genuingly warm and friendly staff. Everyone from front desk to housekeeping was professional and helpful. Wait staff were exceptionally charming and kind. Sidenote: Please tip remember to tip the staff, especially house keeping as these people are paid the least for their hard work. Food - Breakfast included fresh fruits, excellent fresh juices, and wonderful egg selections (diff. omelets.) Dinner - All three meals were great. Point of reference - we don't like fast food or greasy diners. We're not exactly picky and love Mexican food. The selections varied and many options were available when we were there. Fish, beef, chicken, pork, fruits, salads, and deserts. No complaints. Lunch (not included) was quite good. We loved the ceviche and pulpo (fresh octopus). There's a t.v. room, an internet room, a game room, and a bar. The best message I've ever gotten was from Blanca. Deep tissue and aroma therapy; by the time she was done, I felt like I was floating on a cloud. The other message therapist was Gabriel which my partner stated was also very good. We both had another message the next day. Yes. That good. Quinta Avenida (Playa's hip restaurant, bar, clubs, cafes) was a 10 minutes walk from the resort.
