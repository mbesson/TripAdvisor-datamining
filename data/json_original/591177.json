No. But I am intrigued looking over all the glowing reviews (with few exceptions) with how my memories of this place clash with its current image. I have very mixed memories of the ULC. (For the record, it is a member-only club, not a hotel, that rents out some of its rooms.) On the one hand, I have fond memories of being taken here as a child to eat with my father, who was a member. I also have good memories of meeting him at the club as a young professional, working in the Loop. The wood work is grand, the stairs impressive, the art collection 'impressive'. And I recall the food and service as excellent. But here's the catch. Hard to believe today, in 2012, but the ULC was one of the very last, if not the last, of the men-only clubs in the city of Chicago to open its door to women members. The ULC did not admit women members until the very late 80's, if not early 90's, and, adding insult to injury, hemmed and hawed and hotly debated the pro's and con's of such a move before finally taking the leap into such a radical act. It gets worse. Not only were women not allowed as members in the years I went there with my family, but when a child, I, my mother, and my sister had to enter the club by the side door. No, I am not kidding. Now my father, to my memory, went with us (through said side door), but, unbelievably, we 'females' HAD to enter through the side entrance (which I understand today is the main entrance!). Even my grandmother--mother of the club's member (ie my dad)--was not allowed in via the front entrance. Yuk. Have women members changed or improved the ULC? I think so, judging by the offerings of the organization; it seems that opening up all the male-only clubs everywhere revitalized them. But I do find it very strange to have these memories, to know these facts, and to look at the 'history' section on the website, or the Wikipedia write-up on it, and to see no mention--at all--of what a very big deal this was. Who knows? Maybe one of these days, I'll stay at the club--just to have the last laugh!", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mesa, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cRoom was unimpressive\u201d", "Author": "matthew516", "ReviewID": "UR124885219", "Content": "This is a classic old club, complete with the weekdays dress code (no denim!).

The club is very luxurious with high ceilings and beautiful massive old furniture. It is located on Jackson between LaSalle and Dearborn, just steps away from the financial district. Although the address is on Jackson, the entrance is actually around the corner on Federal. There are lots of great restaurants nearby. As expected, the exercise facilities are marvelous and the staff is outstanding. Having said all that, it is a private club and not a hotel. The rooms are good sized, very comfortable and fully equipped. The bath room was tiny but had a nice big stand up shower so it met my needs very well. The furniture and decorations are a bit old style but I found that to be part of the charm. There is excellent room service, same day laundry and dry cleaning and lighting fast (as fast as my office) free wifi. The room rate was about half of a business hotel in Chicago but, apparently, you have to be a member or the guest of a member to get a room (my client made the reservation for me). This is a business club and the dress code (no jeans) and surroundings would make it inappropriate for children and would probably not be a great choice for tourists. The food is typical dinning club. Not real fancy but good. If you have a dietary restriction, this is not the place to eat. I'm on a big time low fat diet and pride myself on being able to find things to eat on any menu, but this place was a real challenge. The chefs are very unaccomodating on doing anything off menu or preparing anything is a special way (I asked that a dish be made with a minimum of oil and the chef told the server \"no\"). I can see where some people who prefer more modern surroundings might find this place too old fashion, but I found it a wonderful and unique experience and I would stay here again if offered the opportunity.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Average-ish Hotel\u201d", "Author": "kaieisle", "ReviewID": "UR119322627", "Content": "I stayed at the ULC for a business conference also held in the hotel, so it was obviously very convenient.

Marble walk-in with fantastic water pressure. - Amenities like free wifi, hairdryer, nice bath products The Cons: - The \"luxury\" aspect of the hotel is a bit overstated. The room looks nice on the surface but is not very well taken care of (ratty towels, stained/torn upholstery, etc). - Maid service is terrible, at least on the 16th floor. Things like tissues and toilet paper not replaced. - If you face W. Jackson Street there are no views. on account to the office building across the (narrow) street.

The wedding itself was also fantastic, as the club has great facilities to support such an event.

I typically only experience minor issues which are definitely not deal breakers. I completed a three-night stay in November 2010 for business. Please be advised that my understanding is that ULCC is a civil/social and athletic club first, with guest rooms offered as a benefit to members and their sponsored guests. My review is based on that assumption. If you don't like abiding by dress codes or facility rules, this is not the place for you and you should stay at a true hotel. Check In--I would say overall check in is where the service is most inconsistent. Sometimes I receive great service; sometimes staff barely acknowledge me. This recent stay I received great service from my male desk attendant. He greeted me as I approached the desk, quickly and efficiently processed my check in and was able to accommodate a specific room request. Check in was approximately 5 minutes, if that. Public Areas--I personally enjoy ULCC's many unique facilities and I would describe them as more country club, classic elegance, not cutting edge modern. The public spaces are well-kept and each has its own dress code. I find the civil formality quite engaging and in general I follow the dress code. I do wear jeans during the week, but not in areas where biz casual is required and when I do I use the athletic entrance. Most people who are members/guests of the club are friendly and welcoming, as are most of the staff. Rooms--I stay in a standard guest room when I stay at ULCC. Each room at the Club is a little different. Some of the rooms are larger but have tiny (and I mean tiny and narrow) bathrooms, while others have a bit smaller living spaces but larger bathrooms. I always request a larger bathroom layout when I arrive and have been accommodated whenever possible. The building sometimes shows its age, and some of the furniture shows standard wear and tear, but in general the rooms are in decent shape. Hotel carpet, neutral decor. Bathroom fixtures are fine and the glass showers are aesthetically pleasing, but the design is flawed and I always seem to get a bathmat full of water because of it. The shower head is great--can be handheld or stationary and is adjustable to many heights. I always have hot water w/good pressure, although it seems none of the bathrooms have exhaust fans, which would be nice. My biggest complaint about the room is the desk chair. It's comfortable if you like an executive chair, but if you're looking for functional, this isn't it. The chair sits way too low for the desk, so if you plan to use your laptop at the desk, expect some discomfort. It makes me feel like a kid sitting at an adult desk. :) ULCC has free wi-fi and I often want to work from my room when I'm there, but the desk setup makes that an unattractive option. I usually end up sitting in the armchair with the ottoman and just working literally from my lap. The best part of the room is the bed. HANDS DOWN the ULCC has the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, including the one at my house. I want one for my house, it's that comfortable. I have the best nights' sleep on their beds. RESTAURANT/ROOM SERVICE-- On the most recent trip, I used room service and had dinner in Rendezvous. For room service, breakfast typically is better than lunch/supper, although both are consistently decent. Be advised that it's not 24 hours; breakfast starts at 6 AM and I think supper ends at 9/10 PM. While everyone knows that room service is expensive, I find ULCC's to be quite reasonable. Breakfast is a steal, frankly -- choose the Club Breakfast! Dinner was pricier, obviously, but good for the general basics. Dinner in Rendezvous didn't go quite that well. My boss joined me for dinner and we had difficulty getting anyone to wait on us (it was approximately 8 PM). We waited about 10 minutes before anyone finally took our order and then when it came she didn't even provide utensils. Another young server took over and he did a much better job. I ordered a fruit plate and the lobster bisque. The bisque was good when they gave me a spoon to eat it with, but the \"fruit plate\" was a plate full of canteloupe and nothing else. I order fruit for breakfast, too, and get a mix, so I know they have different fruits. It was disappointing. My boss's dinner order was incorrect as well, and they never did bring the missing item he ordered. Overall, Rendezvous for dinner was disappointing. The Wigwam is where I normally would eat; consistently good and decent service. I've never eaten in the Main Dining Room so can't rate it comparatively. LOCATION--ULCC is on Jackson and Federal and you can get many places just by walking. Plenty of restaurants/shops nearby and lots of foot traffic during the day. Close to public trans and cabs always available. I typically have a vehicle and they have a parking garage on-site (very convenient). Parking is harder to find during the day, but I've never not been able to park there. Be advised if you validate your parking with the front desk, you have a limit of 15 minutes to leave the garage. For this trip, my rating of 4 and not 5 is for the following reasons: Room service, while very polite, had some difficulties in getting my order correct/knowing what items they had available. Room service staff are always pleasant, but the problems I have seem to indicate a training issue. I also down rated cleanliness because after I indicated to the housekeeping staff (who was also very polite) they didn't need to do full service on my room, she still didn't refresh my bathroom/towels after I mentioned that was all I would like to have done. If you don't have to go through the effort of doing an entire room, taking used towels and replacing them should be a given and especially when requested, so I marked off for that. Also, for the Rendezvous experience noted above. Overall, I like staying at ULCC very much if you don't mind some of the accommodations you make for it not being a true hotel-only facility.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bokeelia, Florida", "Title": "\u201cClass and style\u201d", "Author": "IslandManRides", "ReviewID": "UR88388658", "Content": "This property is Chicago class and style at its best.

The staff was extremely helpful and I was happy that no one was staring at me (call me paranoid). The bellman escorted me to my room and explain everything in the room. The room was small, but nice. The bathroom was really small and and there wasn't a lot of room to move around. The shower was a nice size, no tub, This was surprising seeing as though this isn't a cheap hotel. Another suprise was that I heard no, I mean NO housekeeping carts in the hallway the following morning! Usually you hear the rumbling around of the cars and the maids yelling down the hall, but not here. It was quiet as a mouse. I don't know if this is typical but I sure enjoyed it :) I also enjoyed the free wifi. My conference was 2.5 days and I didn't have a lot of extra time but I did take a couple hours to walk outside. It's in the business district so there are lots of people walking around and many stores to visit. There's a Macy's and Sears about a 7-10 min walk from the hotel and the L station is right around the corner which takes you directly to the airport for about 2.50. DO NOT take a cab to the airport in late afternoon because traffic is gridlocked. All in all it was a nice stay, however I like the freedom of dressing casually at a hotel, and the ULC just doesn't allow this. I also prefer a little more space in the room to move around. But if you don't mind this, and are okay with a very small bathroom, the Union League is a quality place to stay with terrific service.

It was a treat to get to stay: the hotel still keeps many of the touches of a classic grand hotel with an attentive and capable staff, grand marble public areas, fine dining, and comfortable rooms. Prices were lower than I would have expected for the incredible ambience, and included breakfast and access to facilities throughout the large building.. Parking is via a valet at the front door, check-in is just inside the door in an alcove to the right. The checkin was friendly and efficient, you have to leave overcoats with the check desk just inside the hotel before going up to your room. There is a small souvenir stand with club-ware where you can purchase branded items found in your room (the temptation is always there in a place like this!) Rooms are plush and well-equipped. The bed is soft and very comfortable: there is a flat-screen tv with cable and local channels as well as a selection of pay movies. There is a coffee maker and free wireless internet, the windows can be opened a bit , there is no fridge or minibar. There is a complimentary morning newspaper, and the room is very quiet and refined. The bathroom is all marble with a large walk-in shower, excellent hot water through the hand shower with moderate pressure. Complimentary breakfast buffet was served on the fourth floor; eggs, sausage, bacon, fruit, cereal, and rolls. The standards for food overall are very high: a wonderful dinner with a well-prepared choice of entrees, and the 4th floor bar has a wide selection of port wines, whisky, and other classic drinks. The entire hotel is now non-smoking, so the cigar lounge is no longer there.

We were upgrade to a suite for the duration, which proved extremely comfortable and useful for small family gatherings, preparation of 125 wedding programmes, storage of luggage as extended family came and went, and necessary chill-out time. I understand the rooms have been refurbished fairly recently. Ours was beautiful; I am not a huge fan of classic styles but the muted gold, sky blue and dark wood furnishings were understated, classy, and comfortable. Our room, like all others I saw, had a close view of the office building next door. Therefore not much natural light to be had, so artificial light was necessary during the day. Our suite had boat loads of storage (double wardrobe, desk beside the bed, two dressers), two large flat screen TVs and a large bathroom with double sink. A small bar fridge was bought in on request, great for fruit and nibbles. Common to all rooms large and small, occupied by various family members, was the sheer quality of the bed and linens. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. The mattress pillowtop had a down top as well. The feather pillows, designated \"medium\" and \"soft\" were luscious. We had complimentary breakfasts in the Wigwam. It's primarily a business environment particularly during the week, so as the members of my large and raucous family began to arrive we risked upsetting the balance. However, the staff were gracious and attentive. The Rendezvous Bar was also an excellent meeting and socialising spot, with good sandwiches and a particularly nice Caesar Salad (a whole grilled romaine with the usual accoutrements). We are casual people so were apprehensive about the dress code. Certainly, during week days, the tone is definitely all business. In the weekends jeans are allowed on Saturday mornings and all day Sunday, so things loosen up a little. We personally were careful to respect the 'code' and when we wanted to go more casual or have a run, we simply used the athletic entrance, a back door to the street but using the same lifts as everybody else. The gym, changing rooms, sauna, pool etc were outstanding. I used the gym equipment almost every day and there were never more than 3 or 4 others there at the time. Free Wifi was brilliant as was access to the business centre for printing etc. The library looked like a wonderfully serene spot, only I had no time to enoy it. Location-wise, I have stayed all over the Loop and North Michigan, and have usually preferred to be closer to the river. But the ULC is just 15 minutes walk from the river and a mere three blocks from the Art Institute (which serendipitously had free admission for the week to celebrate the opening of the new Renzo Piano wing) and Millenium Park. Easy to get a breath of fresh air and view of that fantastic skyline whenever we wanted. And as for the wedding -- what a gorgeous venue for a wonderful event. And the bride and groom weren't so shabby either! ULC was great. I'd love to be able to stay there again, but I do believe there needs to be a membership connection (the mother of the bride is a member). On value for money alone -- even considering we were getting a good deal -- we could not have done any better anywhere in Chicago.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cLoved every bit of its past world charm\u201d", "Author": "TofuGirlSF", "ReviewID": "UR26330326", "Content": "I loved this place.

It was a mixed bag, but it was an overall good experience. I arrived after my husband and picked up keys at the desk. Very friendly and attentive staff. I had a very small room on 15th floor with no view. As mentioned before, there was no frig, no safe, no ice on floor. Clean, nice Gilchrist and Soames bath products, great bed with two pillowtops and deluxe linens. My key malfunctioned twicw during my stay, as did my husband's. Much later I discovered a snack and ice machine on another floor, but you have to search diligently through your room service menu to find that.. There is a good room service menu, but no alcohol. There is the Rendezvous bar on 4th floor where you can order drinks charged to your room,but if you're alone you may feel out of place! I had to dine and spend many hours by myself and felt out of place here at times.I chose room service one night and the food was excellent. The food for our meeting was also good, but I was disappointed that they did not offer a vegetarian option. I didn't touch the entree and no one said a word or offered any substitutions. This is the year 2008 and there are many vegetarians on this planet, thank you. The athletic facility was nice, however if you wandered to the highest floor where the squash court was located it was filthy. There was trash and dirt all over the floor, as if it had been abandoned for months. Also, you have to go through a staff area to get to the workout room. The pool is NOT Olympic sized..it has to be 50 meters to meet that standard. It is 20 meters and roped off to 4 lanes. Nice for swimming, but short. I loved all the huge meeting rooms and the amazing art throughout the building. It's on par with a small gallery and boasts a curator. However, they do not have any tourist info in the lobby...no \"Chicago This Week\" magazines, city maps, etc. I did find those at the Washington Library a couple blocks away. Also, we received a Wall Street Journal paper daily. Sorry, but I'd rather have a Chicago Trib with local news and a crossword puzzle. The area is nice, but it's rather focused on the DePaul crowd. Several local eateries, such as the Chipotle Grill, My Thai and the small Mexican restaurant are only open till 4 pm.There were only 2 food options available on a Monday night in the entire block and those were Dunkin Donuts and Subway! Be prepared to do some walking or take a cab. There is a very nice coffee shop across the street from the hotel. This makes up for the subpar coffee makers in the room and the lack of morning coffee in the club. You could go to the breakfast room, but only if you are dressed to regulation, not in your athletic gear. You are also required to use a separate exit if you are in your athletic clothes or golf shorts. In conclusion, this is a lovely sophisticated place to stay, but it lacks some of the things a traveler needs at times.

Our information specified that we were NOT to dress less than casual. When we arrived at the hotel on Saturday, there was a wedding going on. The staff and the guests were very snooty. I felt like I was at some exclusive gentleman's club and I felt very out of place. I decided to eat breakfast in the Wigwam room. It was empty on Sunday so they showered me with attention and re-folded my napkin every time I unfolded it. I began to feel like I was too uncouthed for the Union Club. During the week, real people arrived and the snootiness of the staff and guest reduced immensely. I even saw young people in the elevator, which weren't seen on the weekend. In spite of the snootiness of the hotel, I enjoyed my stay. The bed highlighted the inadequateness of my bed at home. Their bed was sooooo comfortable that I forgot I was in a hotel, which NEVER happens when I stay at the SUPER 8 (LOL!) In addition to the nice bed, the staff was wonderful--the front desk people, Victor and Arie the bellman, and the Wigman staff. My concerns: the uppity dress code is outdated. With the massive travel restrictions and baggage charges, requiring people to dress up just to walk around a hotel seems a bit antiquidated and prudish to me. The Rendevous staff were not friendly to me at all. I felt like I was in the Civil War era going into that restaurant. The bathroom's size was ridiculous. The WHOLE bathroom was the size of my walk in closet at home and my house is only 1500 feet. I felt choked by the bathroom everytime I had to go into it. I had to use the mirror in the closet to get ready. The room lacked a refrigerator. All hotels are now providing refrigerators in hotel rooms in light of the rising food costs at restaurants and the need to bring leftovers to the room. Union Club needs to add small refrigerators in the room. What I liked about the hotel: 1. The comfortable bed 2. The central location to everything in downtown Chicago 3. The staff 4.

Too bad, since with a facelift, this could be a very special place. The interior of my room was worn. The bed, including blankets, sheets, and pillows looked old. I felt dirty sleeping at this facility. My closet door wouldn't shut. The bathroom was small with little to no counter space. The toilet was leaking and the wallpaper was peeling. The ceiling fan tried to work, but just could never get going. The handle was loose on the exterior door to my room and looked to be in danger of falling off the door. My curtains did not close all of the way unless I held them in place with something heavy (a Chicago phone book did the job). One of the windows looked directly into an office less than 10' away.
