Frankly, if you can affored to stay on the executive floor, with it's segmented arrival area upstairs, it is quite nice as are these far more deluxe rooms/suites. However, the rooms on the standard floors are dark and dingy by contrast. Therefore, while my overall rating is a 3, the executive floors rate a solid 4 while the standard rooms alone rate a 2. That said, even on the executive floor up on top, the views of the harbour are a bit covered by the Intercontinental (former Regent, I think) next door. With all of that in mind, the location of this hotel is it's best feature -- the pedestrian walk goes right to the trainline making corder crossing to China easy, Likewise, it is close to the Star Ferry and all that TST offers.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhielhi, National Capital Territory of Delhi, India", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to be...\u201d", "Author": "subramanyan_nv", "ReviewID": "UR114818864", "Content": "I have stayed at many hotels in the past but this one really made me happy. Price wise it is certainly on the higher side but the overall experience made it good. The staff are certainly very cooperative and friendly. And the fact that most of them understand and speak English makes communicating very easy. They are social at just the right level and they go to great length to make you feel at home - whether it be in helping with the room or telling you about places to see around in the city. And I loved the comlimentary fruits they would give every evening. And I certainly loved the great gym facility and never missed an opportunity to work out. The room I had was compact and pretty; the breakfast is certainly good and the distance to the Metro/Cab station/bus stand is very little which is a great help. This is a place I would definitely want to come back to and recommend to your friends.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Renaissance Kowloon", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d2044020-Reviews-Renaissance_Kowloon-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Salibury Road - Tsimshatsui, 22</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2044020", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c8/c1/06/standard-room-with-bigger.jpg"}}
