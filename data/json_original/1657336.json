The rooms are actually pretty nice. Everything worked well. Good flat panel TV, comfortable bed, separate sink from shower and ample space. No pool, hot tub or restaurant on site. Workout room is 3 machines. Short summary; in any other neighborhood, this hotel would be 3.5 stars.

Like Lostn Transit I didn't want to spend $180 a night plus $18 for parking at the hotel near Universal Studios so I decided to stay at this Best Western. My wife, my two kids, and I had a car so I didn't mind staying at this location, and we weren't going to stay out too late anyway. The hotel is in an industrial part of town as the reviewers say. I personally didn't think the location was as bad that some people made it out to be. Anyway, to get into the rooms of the hotel you would have to walk by the lobby/front desk. It's not a motel where you just park outside and walk to your door. Parking is inside and underneath the hotel and from there you walk to the lobby to get to all rooms. The rooms are clean and the beds are decent. This place is probably at most 2 years old so everything looks fairly new (except for the worn towels). Instead of curtains, they have shutters. There is a minifridge, microwave, AC/fan, and 27\" flat screen TV. The complimentary breakfast was decent. It had the basic danishes, bread, muffins, hard boiled eggs or scrambled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, and OJ. Also you can make your own waffles but there might be a line for that. One of the complaints I had was that the shower head was one of those low flow ones, so you can't take a super quick shower. However, probably because of the low flows, there is always super hot water even during the morning rush (which even at nicer hotels is problematic). I also thought that the small hair dryer was a little weaker than the normal small hairdryers found at these hotels. Parking can be a problem but I was lucky to park on the side where you are not blocked for 2 nights. The other night I parked on the doubles side where you can get blocked. I did get blocked but in the morning the front desk person was able to move the truck out for me to get out. (You have to leave your key at the front desk if you are parking on the doubles side and are on the outside blocking some other vehicle). Universal Studios is about a 20-25 minute drive. Hollywood is probably another 10 minutes away. There is a Ralph's and CVS which is about a 2 minute drive. I wouldn't stay here without a car. I didn't see the buses at all so the wait is probably quite long.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cClean, comfortable, it is LA though.\u201d", "Author": "V_LFAV", "ReviewID": "UR126121981", "Content": "If this hotel were anywhere else it'd be double the price.

I was traveling in LA with a larger group. They were staying at a Universal City hotel that was $180+. a night plus $18. for parking. That was more than what I wanted to spend, so I elected to save the $ and say a \"short\" distance away. The front desk staff was great all three times I encountered them. The room was very clean. In fact, I am not sure how old this building is, but based on the condition of my room, I would guess less than a year. All the furnishing/bath/bed were in excellent shape. The room was much larger than most I stay in. If the was one minus, it was that I could here TV and kids voices through the walls between about 8 and 11 pm. I always travel with ear plugs to I used them. That managed to block out about 90% of the noise - enough to fall asleep. I had a car, so I did not walk anywhere in the area surrounding the hotel. I had looked at it using google maps before I made the reservation and could tell based on experience that It would not be healthy for me to venture out. I drove into the under building parking lot each evening and drove out again the following morning. If I were you, I would plan on doing the same. I felt very safe driving to and from the hotel. The parking is free. The continental breakfast was OK. Also free. I paid under $90. per night (including tax). It was worth every penny. Finally, the trip up from Universal City in the evening was a short 10-15 minutes drive. From the hotel to Universal City in morning rush hour was a tense 40 minutes in bumper to bumper, stop and go traffic. The pic of the room does not do it justice.

If you need high speed Internet, this isn't the place for you; my speed-test on several occasions was less than 1 mbps, often came in for downloads at .78 mbps (slightly faster than dial-up). Also, the hotel is not really close to anything; it is in a mostly commercial/industrial area away from major shopping/dining areas. Oh, and if you happen to get this place on Priceline.com get ready for a room facing a very noisy and busy major thoroughfare (these are the ONLY rooms available for Priceline guests).

We were meeting up with my grandparents to go to Universal Studios. My Grandparents stayed at the Hilton that is on the Universal Studios property, they payed way more then us and it seems that we had a better experience then they did. This hotel is about a 10-15 min drive to universal studios depending on the time of day and traffic. The continental breakfast is great! They have a waffle maker to make your own waffles, and then the typical cereal, pastries, coffee and orange juice. But the Waffle's just seemed much better than what you typically get at a hotel's free breakfast! The hotel is very clean and looks very new. The Only complaint and its not really a complaint is the location and our room was facing a preschool and the kinds were noisy in the morning, but im sure you can ask for a different room! Its located in the middle of nothing. A few gas stations and grocery stores, but thats about it. I'v seen some reviews of people not feeling \"safe\" here. Let me tell you, im the kind of person that always worries about stuff like that, but i felt completely safe here. You park inside the parking lot which is a 30 second walk to the doors to the lobby and then you go directly to the elevator to get the which ever floor your room was located. I would defiantly recommend staying here if your looking for something a little bit cheaper then staying right in hollywood or visiting the studios!

Gotta love the huge long counter for all my beauty products. House keeping was wonderful and nice. HUGE SECURITY ISSUE! The front door is open to anyone and not locked ever. This hotel is in a BAD area of town even the desk clerk said this. Probably why no female clerks worked there the 8 yes 8 nights we stayed. The 3rd floor smelt like POT and we just dismissed it. My sister left after visiting and was harrased and chased by a guy saying his girlfriend was staying in this hotel somewhere sleeping around on him.. he begged her to have sex with him and chased her down the steps to the desk clerk and a guest waiting to check in. She was screaming this guy is chasing and harrasing me. The crazy guy says no I am security I am security. The front desk guy says no you are not get out of here.

Another tip.. the refrigerator motor is warm and refrigerator is in a cupboard. We had to take it out otherwise it smells like burning motor and wood.

We arrived at 4pm and checked in without any line or hassles. The room was fantastic! It was big (the bathroom was HUGE) and had plantation shutters with a window we could actually open (I love fresh air in hotel rooms). The television was a big flat screen and we brought our dvd player to hook up to it. We also brought our laptop since they had FREE wifi! It only took us 10 minutes to get to the Magic Castle in West Hollywood. We noticed Universal City is super close to the hotel (we passed exits for Universal Studios within 3 minutes of driving). Upon arriving back at the hotel (around 2am) the parking garage was near capacity. There was one spot available on the double car side, so we had to drop our keys at the front desk so that they could move our car if the person parked in front of us needed to get out.

The room had everything we needed, it was very clean and you can tell it was just newly renovated. The hotel also had a great continental breakfast and we found that the staff were really nice and polite. When we checked out I accidently left my leather jacket in the closet (actually my FAVORITE leather jacket!!). I called a few hours later when I realized I left it and inquired about it. The front desk already knew about it and suggested they can send the jacket to me by mail and just charge my credit card for the shipping cost.

First, it should be said that there is little to look at in this area. It's located on Lankershim which features great accessibility to attractions that (thankfully) saves you from entering the highway system. Unfortunately, the area it is located in is a decidedly less nice location. Late at night, you don't have to go very far to see prostitutes on corners and some shady dealings. This doesn't mean you're risking your life to stay here, but if you're bringing a family with small children (we're all well old enough), then the area is probably not the best. The front desk was incredibly accommodating and got to know us after frequently seeing us in and out everyday. The breakfast is pretty typical hotel fare; nothing special. The room itself, however, had good and bad about it. On the one hand, it was clear the hotel was new. Walls, carpets, beds, and all felt fresh and unruined. The windows inside the room (large slat-like blinds) were very nice to see upon entering, but having spent several days, you begin to see little things that cheapen the room; this mainly deals with the actual construction. Our room, for example, featured a bathroom door that would not properly close (the doorjam wasn't built at the correct depth), floor molding that gradually separated from the carpet along the wall (it went from having no gap near the door, to nearly a half-inch gap in the other corner), broken remote controls (you would have to hold it upside down and at an angle to get it to work), and a broken door sensor. The sensor was annoying, very much so. If your door happens to not close all the way, a loud beeping noise emits to make you aware to close the door. Unfortunately, any time we left or entered the room, this sensor would go off regardless of whether the door was closed. We told the front desk and they gave us a flimsy \"it's supposed to do that\" excuse (this only occurred with one of the other couples). It was annoying coming home late to listen to the noise for those several seconds and, seeing as one of us fell ill in the room, it would constantly awaken anyone trying to sleep in the bedroom. All in all, these were small inconveniences that I feel could be improved to make an average stay even better. As is, it's not a terrible place to stay and the only legitimate complaint I found was the area it was built in. If that's not an issue for people, then there's no reason to not stay, really.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, AZ", "Title": "\u201cExcellent NEW Hotel, just north of the Hollywood area\u201d", "Author": "MGMTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR73959764", "Content": "Frankly, you've been there - \"Hollywood\" Glamor Capital?

The security cameras in the lobby kind of give it away. Now, we had absolutely no problems here any d we found everyone to be friendly and helpful. But, my \"mom radar\" was in high alert upon check in. I certainly would not feel safe walking around at night in this neighborhood. I think I see why the room was so cheap now. Also, although they give you a free breakfast, there is a very small breakfast room and many food items were left completely uncovered and unrefrigerated for several hours....especially an uncovered plate of hard boiled eggs...no refrigeration and no cover.

Completely unfamiliar with the Los Angeles area. Chose a Best Western based upon experiences at a BW in Monterey, CA, that are always positive. I traveled with 3 friends, including one who is acutely aware of the cleanliness of her surroundings. Being unfamiliar with the area, I booked this hotel thinking the great rate (approx. $100) was because it is brand new, and was a special rate. (I now believe the rate was due to the area--not horrific, but definitely a working class neighborhood with a bit of an economic downturn.) Before our visit, I called twice for information, and the staff was as helpful as each could be, with the limitation being their product knowledge. I sold the hotel to my girlfriends using the fact that it was brand-spanking-new and would be sparkly clean--the very definition of \"irony.\" We were able to check in very early, around 11 am, which was wonderfully convenient, and the employee at the desk was very helpful, though a bit slow at procedure. Still, we were in no great hurry, so I didn't mind this. Upon entering the room, however, one of the first things we found was a fake fingernail on the counter of the bathroom, which, frankly, freaked my girlfriend out. We talked her down by laughing and taking pictures of it. I also couldn't get the window to lock when we closed it. We left a short time later without mentioning anything to the desk--I assumed the maid had unknowingly lost her nail while wiping down the counter, though one would think a final look around would be S.O.P. Frankly, we just wanted to get our 2-day trip started. When we returned late in the evening, the others got ready for bed, taking turns in the bathroom. Due to the \"fingernail incident,\" my girlfriend gingerly pulled the covers back, and found...several short hairs in the bed. The other bed was inspected, and found to have hair on the sheets, too, and a couple of stains on the pillow case. I promptly walked downstairs to speak to the employee on duty, who was assisting other guests. He did acknowledge me, and 10 minutes later, I was able to tell him what was happening--poor guy's eyes got really, really big. He gave me a key card to the room adjacent to us, and I went upstairs, grabbed my girlfriends, and went next door to look at the room. That room, too, had hairs in the beds, and also in the shower. I went downstairs again, and this time, the employee locked up the hotel, grabbed a couple of key cards, and came upstairs with me to look at the rooms. We looked at 2 (3?) more rooms, settling on one that seemed acceptable, with a request for clean sheets for one of the beds, because that one, too, had small hairs in it. While we went to our original room so that we could move our belongings, one of my girlfriends informed me that she had wiped urine off the toilet seat and hair off the bathtub with a sanitizing wipe while I was speaking with our other, still slightly freaked out, friend. We decided that as it was after midnight, we would keep that information from her so we could get some rest. I did inform the employee when he brought the sheets, however, and told him we would address the issues upon checkout. He replied he would make notes for the morning employee. Upon checkout, I gave the employee at the desk our room number, and was mildly surprised that he didn't mention our experiences at all---if I had not brought it up, he would have gladly checked us out without comment. When informed that our stay was unsatisfactory,and that we did not feel we should pay for the hotel room given the experiences, he replied he was unable to make that decision. I asked for someone who could make that decision, and was told that person wasn't on premise. I asked what time s/he would be in, but it wasn't for a couple of hours, which didn't work with our schedule. I asked if he could get a hold of someone, and he offered to call someone. When he got off the phone, he told me he could reduce our rate to approximately 30-odd dollars, which was a substantial savings from the original AAA rate. While I didn't agree with the charge, I took it due to lack of sleep and time constraints--I had no energy or time to deal with the situation-- with the intention of calling later. I didn't call later. I'm just not going to waste my time for $38, when I feel it's better to educate other travelers. I've mulled over whether the hairs could have been fibers, but I've decided it doesn't matter what the heck was in the bedding. There were stains and threadbare (!) areas on the sheets, and it just wasn't satisfactory--especially given the hotel is so new it wasn't listed on TripAdvisor at the time. There are clearly cleaning protocols that need to be addressed. The whole experience leaves one with the impression that no matter how new the restoration of this hotel, close inspection reveals that attention to detail isn't a priority. A positive note: parking is free, covered, and the entrance to the hotel is close, so if one doesn't feel safe in the area--which I did--then one won't feel vulnerable moving from the car to the hotel.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Burbank Airport Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d1657336-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Burbank_Airport_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$78 - $103*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7615 Lankershim Boulevard</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">91605-2814</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1657336", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3e/cb/3ecb3faa4801f765b1f191b9916ce09a4large.jpg"}}
