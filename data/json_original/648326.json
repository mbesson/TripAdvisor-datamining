I would highly recommend staying here for a few nights when you get tired of the cramped and touristy Sultanahmet area! The Sheraton is approximately a forty minute train ride to Sultanahmet and will cost you either 4 or 6 Lira. So you could technically stay here and commute to Sultanahmet if you wanted. The rooms are INCREDIBLE--tastefully decorated and spacious. Our bathroom in this Sheraton was almost the same size as our ENTIRE room in Sultanahmet! The workout room was incredible. Unfortunately, they were renovating the pool so we couldn't see that but I heard it was amazing. There are also some restaurants hidden behind the hotel--including a fried chicken joint and a Pizza Hut. Although most people seem to say this hotel is only good for business purposes, I would disagree. We finished all of our tourist activities in SUltanahmet in three days. After that, it isn't worth paying more for those tiny rooms when you can pay about $50 less per night AND get better rooms here! Finally, I did want to give a shout-out to the bellhop (I'm blanking on his name). He was awesome! He was very helpful with directions and went out of his way to help us find a Burger King and get us delivery to the hotel. I will definitely return to this hotel and recommend it to my friends and colleagues.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cok, but for business purposes only, preferably in this hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nadine_Moscow", "ReviewID": "UR128065520", "Content": "Pros: - the price is affordable, especially if you compare it with Moscow hotels:)) and have a special discount. - the room service is really, really good, all the stuff is very friendly and helpful - the breakfast is well-served and tasty, though it's a problem to have your teacup filled - waiters are too busy. - rooms are nice and comfortable, though not the style I like, but they seem a little bit shabby, especially in the bathroom, and some minor things are not working - jalousie, for example. The bed is very comfortable. - the congress center is modern and covenient. - spa center is a very nice add-on to your working day. We had a real pleasure in th hammam (I do hope I've spelled it right) cons: - very far away from city center and not easy to get there, even on a taxi, cause there is a bit of traffic jams in Istanbul. Also nowhere to go in the vicinity - no chance for a pleasant evening walk. - a significant minus for a business hotel - wifi internet connection in the rooms is additional 18 euros a day. It's at least strange in my opinion. To be fair - they have free wifi access in the lobby including available PCs, but I think that a 5-star business hotel should provide free access everywhere. Generally - it does not suit you if you want to see old Istanbul and it's perfect if you have business in this very hotel, a congress held there for example.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cif you like to feel home,this is the right hotel..\u201d", "Author": "Ahmad K", "ReviewID": "UR127352876", "Content": "It was a business trip to \u00c4\u00b0stanbul.The hotel is extremely clean,very comfortable rooms and large beds,delicios foods...Service was great from the all smiling faces staff.

We wanted to go to the black sea, on the day of our flight back home, and which isnt the most popular place, and he came back with a great plan and satisified our time requirements.

Sometimes the costs are reported in Turkish Lira and other times the prices are reported in Euro. The room cost through the conference was 230 Euro. I managed to find it for 170 Euro on the Sheraton site. I have no idea why this is... It's gouging. The room rate was different for each of the 4 nights I was there because it was converted each day from Euro to Lira, which is a bit odd. The facilities are very nice. My room was huge, contemporary, and had a king bed. Here are the negatives. First, you'd expect that in a large multinational chain such as the Sheraton, every staff member who has guest contact would be at least bilingual in Turkish and English. That is not the case. One day, housekeeping did not clean my bathroom, but took all my towels. The first time I called the operator, she told me she'd take care of bringing me towels. Nothing happened after an hour. When I called back, the operator (I'm not sure if this was the same individual) admitted that she could not speak English. When I tried to exchange some Euro one afternoon, the staff member at the desk admitted he didn't know what I was asking because he didn't speak English. As well, the doormen do not speak English. This was a problem because if you wanted to go out of the hotel somewhere for dinner, there was a good chance that the doormen had no idea about anything... Although I am multilingual, Turkish isn't one of the languages I know... So this was a huge problem. As well, the towels were horrific. They were thin, and frayed. And the face towel that I had on the first day, was never replaced for the duration of my stay because no one knew what a \"face towel\" was. Fortunately, someone did understand what a \"bath mat\" was. No one in their right mind would stay at this hotel. It is near nothing.

We had booked a room at 175 euros a night without breakfast which seemed quite expensive for a place of this quality. As the hotel was very busy we were given an upgrade to a Club Room but weren't allowed to have free wi-fi because it was an upgrade. The room was fine - quite big with a sitting area. We went to the Sky Bar because we had been given a discount voucher for drinks. It was so dingy and dated - and empty because the price of drinks was astronomical.

We were in a company car but they told me that a private taxi should be around 50 - 60 turkish lira (around EUR 25). Be prepared for an exciting ride because in Istanbul there are a lot of aggressive drivers on the road who squeeze their cars in every spot they see. The lobby is nice and check-in efficient. We had some drinks in the lobby bar which has a good atmosphere. I stayed in one of the club rooms which was big and comfortable and equipped with flatsscreen etc.There was one pitfall, the temperature was 26 degrees celsius in the room (outside only 16 degrees celsius so they must have turned up the heating). Since the airconditioning was not working, the only way to make it bearable was to open the window. I don't have any trouble sleeping, but if you are a light sleeper this might cause problems for you because of the busy road next to the hotel.

Bad location, poor english, low water pressure and a strict no food/beverage policy. Ok, this location is out of the way of anything fun. Its in the new business district. A taxi to the Taksim Square costs about 20 USD one way. You can take the minibus to the subway (About 3 USD) but that is timely, confusing and cumbersome. For me, I would've gotten a hotel where the action, restaurants, shopping, cultural spots, transportation lines are conveniently located like in the Taksim Square area. The Sheraton Maslak has a free hotel shuttle that takes to you Taksim Square three times a day. The problem is that the driver doesn't go straight to Taksim Square. He drops his pals off along the way enroute to Taksim Square. It felt like a public bus. This was frustrating. One day, I came back to the hotel with Starbucks coffee in my hand and the security guard would not allow me to bring it in due to a strict hotel no food/beverage policy. He insisted I finish the coffee outside. \"Please, finish your drink outside!\" So, I spoke with the manager and he confirmed the no food/beverage policy. I never felt so insulted and humiliated. That's because beers cost 10 USD each in the bar. So, ask for prices before you order to avoid sticker shock. Also, they screwed up my reservations and I did not get the free breakfast for the first two days I was there. I tried to explain that our conference coordinators made a contract but to no avail. On the third day they fixed it, apologized profusely and I got the breakfast included in my rate. There was a noise of trickling and running water in my bathroom they couldn't resolve. I think the noise came from a water pipe in the walls. The building is relatively new so there are occassion popping sounds resulting from construction and building materials settling in that woke me up in the middle of the night. There is free wireless internet only in the lobby along with four internet ready desktop computers. Internet is not free in the rooms. Surprisingly, the staff doesn't speak english very well and I had to ask for the same thing several times but in different ways. Frustrating indeed. Regarding cultural sites: The Grand Bazaar inside and out. Although both will haggle and negotiate keep this in mind - Grand Bazaar shops inside? Expensive. Grand Bazaar shops outside? Better prices. Blue Mosque? Worth it. Despite sign posted at the entrance, women should cover their hair but westerners don't and Men shouldn't wear shorts but westerners do. A Bosphorous River Boat Ride? Yes, definitely. It'll cost about 30 USD for a two hour ride with a shopping/restaurant stop in the middle. Beware of carpet/rug salesmen who start out offering rugs at 3000 USD and drop it down to 500 USD...\"This is only for you my good friend...And, It is my best price!\".

Also, Maslak is not the business district - there are others... while it is on its way to becoming the financial district, it is too much in its infancy still, I would recommend the hotel if the purpose of your visit is bus\u00c4\u00b1ness in and around the Maslak area.", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cFantastic service!

It seemed to be recently renovated and even had a proper tv set. The breakfast was ok, but not worth the money. One word of advice - i made the mistake of booking this hotel on the European side but i had to travel every morning to the Asian side - not a good idea unless you fancy spending 1.5 hours in a cab to manage the 15 kilometers...", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNot so great\u201d", "Author": "shawbee99", "ReviewID": "UR16824997", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for about a week while in Turkey on business. The location is quite far away from any type of attraction or decent restaurant. There is a free shuttle that goes to Taksim Square four times a day but the last day return is an early 10pm. A taxi ride to the tourist area was well over 30 dollars. You can take the city bus from the front of the hotel to Taksim, it takes well over an hour but only costs 1.50 ytl \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not for the faint of travel. As for the hotel, the renovated rooms are very nice, spacious and well appointed. The bathrooms are a little out of place in the nice contemporary room though. The water ran brown on more than one occasion. Calls to reception had it solved within twenty or thirty minutes. The biggest surprise to me about this hotel was the prices. A Corona in the lobby really does cost around $20 us dollars. The room service food is equally overpriced and of average quality. They hype their L`Altra Risacca restaurant, but the consensus among my group was it was severely overpriced and of questionable quality. I could not stand to go back after two nights. Something that is not published on their website or in-room guide books is the Asian restaurant (called Mi Do I think) hidden at the way back of the lobby. It had great authentic food, while still tourist prices it is no where near as bad as the rest of the properties price-gouging offerings. Also, the much promoted Sky-Bar was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closed for the summer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when I arrived in June. All in all, I would never stay here again. It does not have a great location and the hotel does not really live up to the Sheraton Brand. It is severely over-priced and the staff for the most part are clearly new to the hospitality industry.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sheraton Istanbul Maslak Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d648326-Reviews-Sheraton_Istanbul_Maslak_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$117 - $293*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "648326", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/96/bc/96bcbfb482c14701f45404d2a969b6e77large.jpg"}}
