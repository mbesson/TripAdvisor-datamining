After the lovely hotels in Varenna, the Dolomites, and Venice, we were a bit put off by the scaffolding, lack of a nice hotel sign, the ordinary looking street, and the somewhat forbidding-looking entry area of the building. The hotel itself is one flight up and when we got upstairs we found a helpful staff, a clean room, and a quiet environment. The breakfast room was pleasant and had it been a bit warmer we could have taken our breakfast on a nice terrace. Breakfast selection was just fine. The big plus of this hotel is that it is just steps away from the Accademia and the Uffizi, as well as what must be the best gelato place in Italy (Grom--ask at the hotel for directions). Also nearby is Trattoria Za-Za in the Piazza del Mercato Centrale where we enjoyed one of our most fun dinners of the trip.

The Academia is on the same street and a mere 100m away, if at all. Finding it is not too hard considering the unlit neon sign on the facade of the buiding, however, construction scaffolding right in front of it camouflaged it a bit. The entrance is somewhat nondescript as you must ascend to the 2nd floor via the stairway or lift, after which opens up the lobby. The staff are not the most gregarious personalities but will answer all questions when asked. Our room was spacious with a balcony to the inner coutyard, where we would relax after many hours of walking, and the restroom was spacious as well. The bath tub was a bit of an inconveience I must say as it did not have a wall-fastened shower head. Breakfast consisted of eggs, a variety of fruits (Kiwis, Strawberries, bananas, apples) and the usual pastries/breads. Also, a coffee/espresso/capucino machine makes it possible to load up multiple times on cofee. I musn't forget to add one can eat to ones heart's content free of charge.

Our toilet flusher button was broken, and the hair dryer falling apart.The staff was nice enough, but need to learn to knock before opening the doors! I don't know if this is common, but our sheets were not changed for the duration of our stay, though they brought clean towels daily.Being a tile floor (no carpet), the floors are a bit dirty.

We found the staff friendly and helpful--including making sure they had someone at the front desk to check us out at 5 a.m., and get us a cab to the airport. There were students in residence while we were there (though this bunch seemed to be high-school age, not college). We found they weren't troublesome as long as we finished breakfast by 8 a.m., when they tended to invade en masse. Since many of the major sites in Florence open at 8:15 a.m., you'll probably want to be up and out that early anyway.It also helped that we had a room at the far end of the hotel (numbers 120 and up). The students seem to be housed together in rooms numbered 114 and lower. Our traveling companions were in room 115 and were bothered somewhat by noise from the student rooms, but we didn't hear a peep in our room (plus we had a fabulous view of the Duomo from the little balcony). So the upshot is, given the location and quality of the hotel it's a bargain for the price, and the students were minimally troublesome.

All that for a price that's at least U.S.$50 less per night than similar 3-star hotels around historic Firenze. But then all I want in a hotel is a decent bed, lots of hot water, and a location I can reach during the day while touring the area. As for the night life, I met my friends in trattorias  it was fine.", "Date": "Nov 19, 2002", "ReviewID": "UR276683662", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "The Worst Hotel Ever I am currently in Florence on the last day of a trip that would have been perfect had it not been for the Hotel California. I booked a Single room for #8364;103 - Room 109, to be more specific. WATCH OUT! The room was no bigger than 10 x 12 feet and had a window that looked out onto...NOTHING. The staff doesn't really have a great grasp of the English language and were unfriendly and extremely un-helpful. Additionally, they sprang a NO GUESTS PAST 12 MIDNIGHT curfew upon us at the last minute - this rule is not posted. When I attempted to bring an old friend into the hotel (NOT my room, mind you) the staff promptly CALLED THE POLICE, without clearly explaining what the curfew/no guests rule was.I am well-traveled and am used to staying in 4 star hotels all over the world, and was shocked at the treatment I got. Do yourself a favor - there are many hotels in this vicinity that offer better service, better prices and larger rooms.Good luck.
