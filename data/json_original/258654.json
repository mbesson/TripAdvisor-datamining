The cottages themselves are a little bit dated but are clean and have everything you need. It felt like your home away from home. We had a fantastic time, they have 2 bikes and a BBQ which we took full advantage of. Restaurants, bars are only an 8 minute walk away and the area felt really safe and we were happy to walk around at night. There are a couple of other bad reviews, I just want to note that these date back to 2005, we didn't experience the same problems. I would definitely recommend staying at this place and the price it can't be beaten!

My husband and I love Ocean Beach. We understand that it is a funky, hippie community. So we were super excited when we found the cottages right near the beach! We planned a long, much needed weekend getaway and were truly disappointed with our trip. Our first morning there, I went to take a shower only to discover a tub full of sewage about an inch thick. I was grossed out. We called for help, and they showed up about 2 hours later (we're still waiting to shower so we can start our day). They decide they can't do anything and tell us we'll need to go to another cottage- across the street. So we pack it up and move. Cutesy little cottage- I'm excited. Night time rolls around, it's gettin chilly (it's March). Go to turn on the heat. No heat. Doesn't work. Owner comes out with space heaters. They break. Can't feel my nose it's freezing. Owner says too bad. Owner then says he'll refund us some of our money. It's been 3 years- still waiting for our dough. I hope a lot has changed in 3 years.", "Date": "July 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cbe aware\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3433594", "Content": "When we checked in everything seemed fine. We went to our room and it was the usual motel style: old drapes and polyester comforter. Now lets talk about the bathroom: no hairdryer provided so bring your own, there isnt a real shower liner so all that there is was a shower curtain, the tub bottom looked like it was dirty (poor cleaning job), there was mold in the shower molding (beware if you have allergies). Once you get out of the shower the towels are so rough to use and thin. Have to use two to get totally dry. Then if you thought of relaxing in your nice comfortable bed, think again !! Sheets stunk of bleach that they over dosed on, bed was horrible(my back hurt for two days and I;m in my 20's for god sake). Then it rained and the roof began to leak (in the motel room, not even the beach cottage). We told manager on day duty and they spackled it up and left the garbage we had collecting rain water exactly where we left it. No compensation, just a quick patch and they left. Then came the fraternity. Running in the halls, yelling out the windows, talking so loud its like they were in the room. Overall, I wouldnt stay there again. If your looking for peace this isnt the place to go. We went in april and it was slow but then these fraternity kids came and were up making noise at 2am and all the manager did was knock on their door. Thanks, really helped my 5 hours of sleep. Even the cottages are overpriced when we glanced in them. You have no real privacy or family atmosphere when there are barbecue grills that anyone can use. Its right on the boardwalk and within walking distance of Joes crab shack which was the only good thing about this place. Be aware of beach bum lady who yells randomly at people!

I was booked to stay a 3rd night, but cut my stay short and checked into another hotel. I was very disappointed with my stay. I travel extensively both nationally and internationally and have fairly modest standards for accommodations, but I found the property in serious need of improvement. 1) Although advertised as \"recently renovated\" on the website I booked through, the unit was in was in need of paint, floor refinishing, and accessories. 2) The heat in the unit did not warm the bedroom (or living room area very well). I slept with 3 blankets and still was cold. 3) The kitchen appliances were in need of updating. I had to repair the coffee pot. The kitchen utensils were very shabby. 4) The noise was terrible. Even with all doors and windows closed, traffic, pedestrians, and airport noises kept me from sleeping. 5) The parking situation was awful. I had to park as much as two blocks away, on the street, and I also received a $40 parking ticket since I did not see a restricted parking sign when I parked after dark. 6) The bathroom was dark, inconvenient and the tub surround had sharp screws coming out of a broken towel track. (There was hot water, thankfully.) The owners seem be turning this into temporary long-term housing instead of vacation rentals. Lots of transient families there when I was. The place was not cheap, either! Wish I had checked tripadvisor before I booked!

I had rented from this company before, but at the Old Town Location. I knew it would be small, and after all they are cottages, but I had been told that this unit was a one bedroom and it was actually a studio! This is blatant false advertising! When you have your kitchen, dining area and living room in the same room as the bedroom, this is called a studio, not a one bedroom! Apparently, many others were also told that they were renting a one bedroom and only to find out that their accomodations were also studios! The other thing that they do not tell you is that these cottages are in the direct path to the airport. I counted 30 planes flying in or out over the cottages between 6:30am and 7:30am and this was a Wednesday! As a matter of fact, every morning at 6:30am, the planes begin and end at about 10:30 pm at night! There are more concentrated times - mainly 6:30 am - 7:30 am!

The photos on the web made the place look very cute, and when we got there, my opinion wasn't too much different. Our small one bedroom cottage was cute, with the paint scheme but it had some serious flaws. First, there was no couch in the place. They had a day single-sized bed that they attempted to convert to a day bed by nailing wood behind it so you could lean on it. This sounds great, but in reality it was very uncomfortable and you essentially had no sitting area in the cottage to relax. Next, let's talk about the bedroom. Again, great pain scheme, cool colors, but alas, you cannot sleep on the walls... The bed sucked so bad, words cannot describe it. I actually think the ground might have been softer. The sad thing is we leave Phoenix so we can enjoy the great weather and sleep in, read, take naps in the cool weather, etc. Not happening. Another thing that you are not told about, and I really think they need to tell you, is the little community. Ocean Beach is a total burnout, pot-head paradise. There are the weirdest people staggering around, it is not clean, etc. I do need to add that during the whole weekend, no one ever bothered us or asked for money (as opposed to the Phoneix gas station where in the space of ten minutes three different people asked me for money). Another issue to consider is the noise. Due to the low temp, there is no AC (fear not fellow Zonies, you will be ok!) In order to cool down the cottages, you leave your windows open. Sadly, the cottages ARE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BUSY AIRPORT FLIGHT PATH!!!!!!!!!!!! Ughhhhh!!!!! In addition to airport hell, you will also enjoy the sounds of drunken hippies running through the alley the sits right behind you. My girlfriend and I actually left a full day earlier at one in the morning, just to get back to our own beds to get a good nights sleep. On the bright side, it wasn't really that expensive, the weather was amazing, so cool that we had to buy sweatshirts, and if you know anything about Phoenix in July, you know how huge that is! Also, the staff at the cottages were very nice.

The washer-dryer unit was a rusted out set, sitting outside under some stairs. Maid service came every other day, and did not even include bed-making. The neighborhood was filled with transients and Ocean Beach itself was too. The only store nearby was a liquor store (with a few groceries), and walking at night did not feel safe.
