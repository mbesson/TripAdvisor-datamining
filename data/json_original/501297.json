It was a wise choice; close to MCRD and not far from many nice restaurants and most SD attractions. The staff at HoJo in SD is exceptional. We arrived earlier than check-in time, so they allowed us to safely store our luggage while we visited Old Towne before returning later to officially check into our room. During the week the staff was eager to help and always courteous and friendly, no matter what issue or question we had. The free shuttle to/from MCRD was a huge bonus as well. On Friday after graduation we weren\u2019t scheduled to fly out until late in the evening, so again we were allowed to store our luggage (this time for 5 people) in a secure area while we spent the day with the boys at the Midway Museum and other attractions. What a great convenience that was for us \u2013 thank you! This HoJo caters to Marine families, so if you're coming to SD for that please consider staying there as they will treat you like family!

The high point was the outstanding courtesy, friendliness and willingness of the desk staff to go the second mile for guests. On the downside, the fireworks from Sea World after 9 PM are a definite distraction, and the food was a disappointment. The breakfast waffles were undercooked and soggy. I had to throw mine out. Could be there were just so many people eating breakfast at the same time. The hotel was overpriced because so many family members stayed here and attended the Graduation Ceremony. The price was bumped from $79 to $109 a night. That's overpriced but other nearby hotels play the same game so there's not much you can do. The quality of food at the Mexican restaurant next door left a lot to be desired. We're from Phoenix and we know good Mexican and Tex-Mex food.

I thought I was in Asian Heaven! The bed was more comfortable that my one at home and there is lots of great Thai food in the neighborhood of it. The staff was increadible, the night person (randy?) was really nice because I made him come open our room and change key and stuff like ten times and he always said 'no trouble at all' hehe. if I ever go to California again I will stay at this one just because of that! The breakfast waffles were good too but I only had it once. Very close to trollys and lots of stuff to see.

The room was clean and quiet, and the bed was comfortable. Not much more to say about the room, really. And our interaction with the staff was limited to check-in and check-out, and at that, both staffers we dealt with were friendly. We only stayed the night, but were definitely satisfied with our stay. Conveniently located near the highway, the hotel is near plenty of food establisments, including a mexican restaurant that offers deals to hotel guests, a bagel joint across the street, as well as a Chipotle and In-N-Out Burger within walking distance.

It was very clean, and the staff was not only friendly, but helped out as much as they possibly could. It was late when we checked-in, but the night clerk, Randy, made sure that we got on the list for the shuttle to MCRD for Family & Graduation Day. The area the hotel is located in is decent, and surprisingly quiet. There are all kinds of fast food, clothing stores, etc. within walking distance. Mission Beach, Ocean Beach & Belmont Park are approx. 10 min. drive, too. There's a computer for guest use in the lobby with a 15 min. time limit, if someone else is waiting to use it. They offer a self-serve breakfast with some of the items offered being muffins, breads for toast, dry cereal, milk, coffee, orange juice, DIY waffles, and fruit.

I was very very pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness and overall comfortablenes of our room. The beds were pillow top mattresses and very comfortable. The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful to us. They took the time to help us figure out the bus systems and answered all our questions.

It is close to all the major attractions ( e.g. Sea World, Zoo, Legoland etc) and is perfectly located across the roads from shops that include chemists, supermarkets and food centres. The rooms are very good. Comfortable beds, coffee-maker, safe and a shower that works well. Noise was not a problem on the second floor. The free breakfast was great - toast, juice, muffins, coffee and even a waffle-maker for those who are into them! ( As an Aussie I am not sure about it for breakfast!!!!!) Found all staff to be extremely helpful - in particular Shane was full of useful information at the desk. They have a deal with Sizzler across the road where you receive a 15% discount. The kids loved the food so we went there four nights in a row!! (Yes, I know we need to get a life!!!) The hotel also has a mexican restaurant that looked lovely, but I didn't get a chance to check it out. They did have the two best waitresses in the world - Paola and Fantasia. (If you go there please say hi for me!) The hotel also provided access to a computer which had internet access in the foyer which was great to check up on e-mails or find directions. The free shuttle service to someof the attractions was also great. Ontime and right where they said they would be. I would have no hesitation in staying there again when visiting San Diego.", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Howard Johnson Inn - San Diego Sea World / Airport", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d501297-Reviews-Howard_Johnson_Inn_San_Diego_Sea_World_Airport-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$79 - $147*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3330 Rosecrans St</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92110</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "501297", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e4/4e/2b/welcome-to-howard-johnson.jpg"}}
