While the parking could be a tad tight, it was still convenient, and very decently priced (this is LA, afterall), services, facilities were of high quality for this moderately priced hotel. I found the included extended continental breakfast perfectly acceptable. They even allowed me early breakfast access as I had to leave for a very early flight. I think I must have been upgraded, because the room was quite large, and very nicely decorated, with very comfortable \"lounge\" chair.

My wife and I were staying in the area due to some meetings and did not want to commute. We stopped by at about 2:00PM and did a quick check-in. During check-in I asked for a place to eat and the desk clerk gave me directions to where she said \u201cwere lots of restaurants\u201d. I went up to the room and when I opened the door, I was almost knocked over by the smell. It smelled like a combination of mold and wet carpet. I didn\u2019t have time to change rooms at that point and opened the window to air the room out. I then set off to find the restaurants and found the directions lacking badly (she had said turn left on the street, but pointed right). One direction ended up in a residential area on a dead end and we drove for about 2 miles in the other direction only to find two restaurants, neither which appealed to us. We returned to the room at about 6:30 only to find the smell still there (while not as bad, I still had to take an antihistamine) and that there were no other rooms. There was a new desk clerk on and when we asked her about a possible restaurant within walking distance (we were afraid to move the car as we had a very early appointment and could not get blocked in), she sent us to Subway! When we started walking down the street, we discovered a wonderful Thai restaurant almost directly across from the hotel. After a great dinner, we returned to the room. During our stay, I made the following observations: Staff: Clueless and two seamed more intent on talking with a friend than waiting on guests. Bed: OK, but sheets were rough and full of \u201cpills\u201d Room: Small, reminded me of a European hotel Noise: There is a great amount of noise from people walking by outside. Also if anyone within a couple of rooms used the shower or toilet, it sounded as if they were in your room. This of course got better after about midnight. Shower: Great shower head, nice soaps, soft towels Parking: Terrible, if you don\u2019t get there early it is very easy to get your car blocked in by other vehicles.

My colleague and I commented several times about the comfortable beds. The size of the room was somewhat small, but ample. My room was on the first floor facing Robertson - some traffic noise, but this didn't affect my sleeping. The spotless bathroom sports granite countertops and was always stocked with fresh towels (to my chagrin). The maid did replace towels every day, even when they were hung, as instructed, to be reused. The coffee maker was located on a shelf in the bathroom (in an alcove, away from the toilet), which I did find somewhat odd, but, then, I don't drink coffee, so it was not a problem for me. If I did have a complaint, it would be that the sink is in a strange location in relation to the toilet (see photo) - but, really, that is just being picky. The personnel at the hotel were all pleasant. The attendants at the front desk were always for advice and directions. Our room was straightened every day. Our free breakfast was always stocked, warm and fresh. Speaking of breakfast, this was not just cold cereal and pasteries - though they were there, too - BWCI had fresh scrambled eggs, cheese mini omlettes, waffles, toast, fruit, cheese and bacon. Definitely some healthy choices there. All in all I would say this is a great little hotel. Free Wifi. The neighborhood is nice and feels safe, I walked the 1/2 mile down to Wilshire for work every morning and evening.

No need too worry about the area I have walked to Starbucks and Walgreens, without hesitation, noone will bother you. It is a quick 5 - 10 min. drive to The Ivy, The Abbey, La Scala, Beverly Center and about 15 min. drive to the Westside Pavillion Mall on West Pico, all of my favorite places and too visit close friends. The breakfast buffet is very good and I have been there 15 mins. before they close, nothing has been removed and their is always plenty of everything and if not someone from the kitchen will bring it out. It's not a problem at all. I am not a breakfast person but in all my visits decide to eat at this hotel! I remember being there with my mom during the December Holidays and attending close friends Holiday party. We received so many gifts I had the driiver drop them off in our room and come back to pick us up. One shopping bag contained several boxes of candy from Europe. It was left by the waste container in the room with paper wrappings on top. We went out the next morning to Beverly Center and returned to find the bag missing. I will be honest the other shopping bags containing Nordstrom,Gucci boxes was not touched. I called the manager and reported the bag of boxed candy missing, which housekeeping thought was garbage (We figured out) and he had a gift card waiting for us upon check out. It was simple and hassle free. I had only expected a simple \"We are sorry\", but he went all out. I have left expensive jewelry in the bathroom and is has gone untouched, always, when I am in a hurry or put something else on and the driver is waiting. I think this says it all about how wobderful this hotel has treated me. In the past I usually stay 4 nights and get the lower rate which works out fine. My longest stay was 8 nights over the Holiday season in December and since I am looking for a home in Brentwood/ Beverly Hills will use this hotel in the future for business as well. To everyone be sure to enjoy your stay and enjoy the real Beverly Hills not just the tourist spots!", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, location\u201d", "Author": "MsIntl", "ReviewID": "UR21688122", "Content": "A couple of my girlfriends and I stayed at this hotel for a concert in town on Halloween weekend. It's a small boutique style hotel that we felt was very reasonably priced at about 150 before tax a night. I must say that I did read reviews before booking and was very afraid of not having a reservation, so I called about 3 times to confirm that everything was ok, and it was. It could be that we booked it directly with the hotel? Anyhow, the rates we found booking directly from the company were pretty much the same as hotels.com and other sites...we used AAA so it saved a few dollars. From the moment we walked in, until the moment we walked out, the front staff was really kind and courteous. There aren't a lot of staff (that we could see), but everything seemed very smoothly run, from the breakfast room to the room cleaning. As someone mentioned, it was comfortable and quiet. The hotel is located on Robertson, which is a pretty noisey street...I recommend requesting a room that has a window facing within the hotel. The location was a great, very short driving distance to places like The Grove, Santa Monica and Venice Beach, and Bev hills. We didn't walk anywhere around the hotel (didn't see much w/i walking distance), but there were some food places and a startbucks within a block. Parking in the hotel is not worth it, as people have complained about. But why pay $11 a day when street parking is *free* overnight? I believe it started from 6 pm until 8 am..plus on the side street by the hotel it was an additional 2 hours (so 10 am..or ahem, us girls slept in until 2 on one day and were ok)...so that's a great way to save a few bucks. The room we had was clean, and the beds were comfortable, twin size. The bathroom was ok..but it was the first time I had used a shower where the base of the shower connected to the bathroom floor....as in no tub. It's not like the shower water went anywhere else in the bathroom, so it was fine. One downfall was that the air conditioner would turn off after a certain somewhat short period of time. We would go to bed with the perfect temperature, then wake up sweating because it was off. I'm not sure if there was a timer on it, or if it was just not working properly? We didn't get a chance to find out. If you notice it giving you the same problem after one night, then check with the front desk about having it fixed. Breakfast at the hotel was great. We made sure to book a hotel with a full breakfast as to save time and eat well...I'm a breakfast fanatic. so it was a really good value to me to save the time and money. One day we made it 5 minutes before breakfast closed and the kitchen lady was sooo kind enough to make us 3 waffle batters without us asking. There were some lounge chairs and a mini courtyard in the hotel, so it was nice to eat breakfast outside while it was a little warm. Internet and printing was free, which is rare for so many hotels these days. Overall...I thought the value was great for this hotel. Wonderful staff, free parking outside, decent driving distance to attractions, and breakfast to start your day. Didn't seem great for walking around...but good driving distance to places in West LA/Bev Hills.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bc canada", "Title": "\u201cbooked on Priceline then they played stupid upon arrival??\u201d", "Author": "pernoski", "ReviewID": "UR18734690", "Content": "Pictures are deceiving!

We received a confirmation via e-mail, with a confirmation number. We received an e-mail prior to arriving, saying that 'they' were looking forward to our visit. When we arrived (4:00 p.m. on the scheduled day), we were told that they had no record of our reservation, could not locate the reservation number, and had no rooms available. The receptionist did offer us one night free in a sister property (in Santa Monica, not at all near the area of the city where we had wanted to stay). We checked on-line and the reviews were extremely poor. We declined the offer, and made our own arrangements for another hotel elsewhere in the city. The receptionist then offered us three Best Western 'gift cards', each for $50 off a stay at a Best Western. Upon examining the cards, however, they each expired in 1/08. (This was March 2008.) Two of the cards, the receptionist (or someone) had used a black marker to cross out the expiration date. I can really see using one of these cards at some Best Western, and explaining that I was not the person who crossed out the expiration date; that the cards should actually still be accepted! I told the receptionist that I wanted a statement, on the Inn's letterhead, indicating that we had arrived on schedule but there was no reserved room for us, and that we would not later be charged for not showing up at the Inn as per our reservation. The receptionist at first refused, saying that he could not do this. He said that of course we would not be charged. I noted that I had no reason, based on my current experience, to believe him. He offered to call his general manager. I said that was fine; that he could explain to the manager that there were two women there who would not leave without this letter. He then apparently decided that he could provide this letter without calling the general manager. However, the first letter was not on letterhead. The next two times my name was spelled wrong (despite clearly printing my name in two-inch-high letters after the first time). I finally was given the requested letter. While we were trying to make reservations elsewhere, a man came in to check in; from what I overheard, he had booked a room with two double beds. He was being given a room with one king. He was traveling with a friend, not a bed companion. When the man questioned this arrangement, he was told that they could provide a \"roll-away\" (i.e., a cot). He eventually agreed, but asked if they could transfer him to the requested double room the next night. Good luck to him. I can't tell you anything about the rooms, the ambiance, etc. The lobby looked clean. Oh, and after I arrived home, there was another e-mail from the Carlyle Inn, saying that they appreciate our business and hoped that we enjoyed our stay. If you want to try staying here, good luck.

It's very quaint, with styles reminiscent of L.A. in th \"good old days\" (i.e. striped chaise lounges and chair pads on wrought-iron frames). The hotel has a small parking garage (subterranean), with a $11 per day charge (but it was kindly not billed to my hotel tab!) The three floors of room are on open-air walkways, and there is a wonderful little open-air sitting area facing Robertson (I assume for smoking), a beautiful little sun deck above the restaurant's sky lights, and a private, romantic Jacuzzi, off the beaten track, yet in an enclosed, outdoor little cubby up a few steps from the sun deck--quite inviting. The buffet breakfast, starting at 7 a.m. is excellent (arrive at 7:15 if you want eggs or waffles), with eggs, bacon, waffles, omelettes, bagels, hot & cold cereals, juices, etc. The thing I liked best about this hotel was the high level of cleanliness throughout. The only negative comments I have are the heater wasn't working in our second room (and nights were at 43 degrees!) (they did send a crew to fix it, which took over an hour), loud fan (mandatory if light's on) in the bathroom of my first room (but not the second), the slamming nature of doors, and the hotel staff's level of helpfulness was average (a few staff had thick accents that were difficult to comprehend and one staff member couldn't help me over the phone with a question I had about whether my reservation had been paid in full by my employer).

The only downside to the room was that the heat/ac fan was a little noisy. But the fan was off most of the time.

The restaurant staff is excellent. There is free wireless internet, but you get nicked $10/day for parking. The chocolate chip cookies in the lobby are history.
