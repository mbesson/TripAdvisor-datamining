We were seated at 6:30 which is their last seating on Christmas Day. There were not just tables and tables of gorgeous delicious food, there were whole different rooms of food categories. Everything you can imagine was served from traditional turkey and dressing, filet of beef, roast duck, ham, dressings and gratins to sushi, crab legs, enormous shrimp, endless salads and vegetables. I'm a dessert girl, and I was not disappointed. From the moment we exited our cab from O'Hare, the 5 star rating was evident and deserved. From the doormen, to the maids, to the concierge and front desk, everyone knew us by name. We did some post-Christmas shopping in the lovely 900 Michigan Mall attached to the hotel. We rested tired feet in the hotel's lobby bar, which is all dark woods and English library decor. The bar staff were excellent, both prompt and unobtrusive. My only complaint was at breakfast. On our last day, we were seated at a table near a man dining alone. He talked loudly on his cell phone throughout our meal. It was the manager's responsibility to enforce the no cell phone rule in the dining room and that never happened. In general, breakfast service was slow all 4 days we were there, less friendly and just not quite up to the standards of the rest of the staff. I reported the cell phone complaint to the hostess who received my complaint graciously and I am certain she reported it to the manager. We just had a ball. We hosted friends and family. We shopped and visited the Shedd Aquarium. We had a fabulous dinner at Tru and a really lovely lunch at the Ralph Lauren restaurant. We ate Chicago pizza at Gino's east and a sundae at Ghiradelli's.

The Four Season's is like an island of peace in the middle of the city. From the doormen, to the front desk staff, to the concierge to the housekeeper, everything was so nice, as if we were a guest in their home. The property is very beautiful. Like most four seasons, the lobby is calming with a lot of natural stone, chrystal chandeliers, wood trim and thick carpet. We had a standard room, which was on the 39th floor, looking over the shore of the lake. The room was spotlessly clean, everything was in perfect working order and overall it was so nice and peaceful that we almost forgot to go out front ot hit the streets for Christmas shopping. We enjoyed breakfast in the restaurant on Saturday morning, and again, it we calm and peaceful. Not much more to say other that it was a perfect weekend get away. Yes, the hotel was slightly more expensive that the oprion across the street, but it was worth every penny. I am sure that my company will not let me stay here on business (rates are a little more than our Corporate accoutn will bear) but when I visit for personal reasons again, this is my first choice! About the only downside that I can comment on is the swaying and creaking at night. The rooms are high in a building that is very close to the shore. It does sway and you do hear noises at night. It was not unbearable, but a minor distraction.

We explained what we liked in restaurants etc. and she came through with great recommendations, not necessarily on the top lists, which was even more unique and fun.

Debated upgrading to suite but we were so comfortable in our deluxe room that we decided to save the upgrade costs spend more on other fun things, food and the world class shopping all within blocks of the outstanding location. One of the best hotel gyms we have ever used. Meeting accommodations superb. Was there a downside? Yes but only three things. No coffee in room or on floor. I can get coffee in my room at the Hampton Inn, but not the Four Seasons!!! I just do not understand the logic on that one. And the wireless internet is way too slow for what you would expect from the FS - better at Starbucks. One evening there was an unexplained power failure, affecting most rooms for several hours - our room was black. Very creepy. Although apologies were made at checkout, I feel that this could have been handled much smoother by such a fine hotel. A nice apology letter under everyones door or maybe even e.g. free muffins or croissants in the lobby the next AM, would have been an outstanding touch. It was like it was swept under the rug. These issues certainly stood out, because everything else was so fantastic. In the overall picture the few negatives were not huge and we remain overwhelmed with our experience and look forward to coming back.

There was no complimentary water provided - odd for a hotel of this level. Housekeeping seems to be a weak link in the chain. On arriving after a very long flight at around midnight we had no toiletries and so had to wait for them to be brought upstairs before we could shower. The guy who did so then stood as if waiting on a tip. I did have to laugh... We had the \"do not disturb\" on the door on two occassions but were once called to check if we wanted turndown and once to see if we wanted the room made up - which woke us up! If they can see the DND and don't knock, they shouldn't call either. The cleaning staff would also shout down the halls to each other and once asked me hurriedly which room I was leaving only to then run down the hall towards it. I assume they are on a time budget. The Internet is ok. There is complimentary wifi provided, and higher speed for streaming etc at $10 per day. The bathroom was a little disappointing for a hotel like this. Although large, they haven't used the space well. There's only one sink, and no separate shower - you have to shower over the bath and this leaks all over the bathroom floor. On our last night we got to bed about 12 and had to be up at 5am for our flight. Across the hall someone was having a room party and there was a lot of coming and going. We called security who, instead of asking the extra guests to leave, asked them to \"keep the noise down\". The party went on all night after this and the hall was littered with food and packaging. I felt like the hotel didn't want to have to deal with a problem guest which meant others had to suffer. All in all, the location is decent and the staff mostly good.

Upgrades to higher speed are available for $10 which I used one of the days but the basic service was adequate for the usual work related activities (emails/ word documents). Good strong coffee is available at no charge in the lobby 24 hours and there are even small muffins there too in the morning. Great location - a half block to the Magnificient Mile and John Hancock Center. I was at a conference. Good quality pens and paper were available and the meeting rooms and equipemnt worked well. It also was multifunctional serving for presentations and in the evening, a black tie gala with decor to match: hard to believe it was the same space. As nice as the carpeted grand staircase was to the conference level (like stepping on pillows all the way up and down), it was a quite a drawback to have to use the stairs or go to a different elevator bank and not be able to go from room to meeting floor with one elevator. The room elevators stop at that floor but access is limited to the spa and not to the meeting room side. It requires going to the lobby floor, navigating to the staircase, passing by where the elevator bank might be, and then into the meeting room area. I had room service one night. The trolly had a built in warming area for the plate which I thought was neat but the food was disappointing: eg grilled asparagus was 4 shrivelled stalks so maybe the warming did that to them.

We are a mid-forties couple and like to stay in nice hotels but this was an extravagant long weekend for us. We have stayed at several Four Seasons properties before and have always experienced the utmost in service. There is usually no better! This time I think they need a little work - just a little. Make no mistake, this is a beautiful luxury hotel. Unfortunately when your reputation is built on perfection, even slight imperfections are noticed. The location is excellent, right on Michigan Ave, across from the Hancock Tower. Easy to walk almost everywhere. In the room, the bedding was lovely, the view over Lake Michigan was almost worth the price of the room, and at any other hotel the things I will mention would not even be noticed. The bathroom was very nice with the vanity and sink being in one room and the shower, bath and toilet being in another. The bathtub was undermounted and surrounded by marble. It looked very nice but, unfortunately, it would have been difficult to relax as the back of your neck would have been resting again the marble slab which stuck out over the tub by about an inch. The walk-in shower was beautiful with marble tiles and a double shower head. However, it was quite a tight fit and the hand-held shower head barely dribbled. The pressure on the wall-mouted head was excellent and even reducing the pressure there did not improve the hand-held. They did provide a good hairdryer and the vanity was equipped with a lighted magnifying mirror which, for over-forties, is almost a necessity for makeup application! There is a restaurant and a bar on the lobby level. The bar is excellent with attentive staff and comfortable seating but when the hotel is crowded, the bar is usually full to capacity. The restaurant is very attractive but I would call the food only slightly better than mediocre. Wine selection is also only okay with a heavy emphasis on California. The front desk staff gets a 6 out of 5 for service, the room service staff and bar staff get a 5 out of 5, the restaurant staff gets a 4 out of 5, and the concierges get a 3 out of 5, at best. Since we had never been in Chicago before, we had some questions. Basically, all requests for dining suggestions were met with a printed sheet which contained what seemed like half the restaurants in the city. Never even offered to make reservations for us. I forgot to pack some items for which I needed to go to a drugstore. After much discussion amongst three concierges, they directed me to a Walgreens 5 blocks away. While shopping the next day I noticed another Walgreens only 2 blocks away. Other question were answered with printed lists or \"I don't know\". Definitley not up to Four Seasons standards!! The gym was well equipped with cardio machines but was somewhat lacking for weight-training machines. I was trying to find a machine for lateral pull-downs and asked the attendant. She directed me to a machine for leg work then smiled and walked away. I used an elastic for the laterals. One other thing that may be annoying to some people (wasn't an issue for us) was that the hotel is split into two sections. The lobby is on the 7th or 8th floor and you have to return to the lobby to move between sections. This means two separate elevator banks to get from your room to the ground. Finally there is a high-end mall accessible from the hotel which is anchored by a Bloomingdales. Nice if you were visiting in the winter. All in all, a great hotel, just not up to Four Seasons' standards.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cLiving off the name\u201d", "Author": "Dingbatcat", "ReviewID": "UR117714756", "Content": "I remember when FS Chicago was ranked number one; I don't know if it was ever top notch but it is sure a also ran now in Chicago.

In such cases, we always end up in the Four Seasons, and are always gmad we did. This time did not disappoint. Location is very good, atop the 900 mall, across Michigan Ave from the John Hancock, and 2 blocks from Water Tower. Short walk to anything, really, as we did not realize downtown Chicago was rather compact, and nothing beyond really far. This is a bonus if you want to drop back during the day for a short break or to to refresh. We took advantage of the Stay Longer promotion, the best value available here, and booked a Deluxe Four Seasons Executive Suite, which is their basic one, requesting a lake view, and the highest available floor. CHECK-IN was swift. Bell took care of the luggage while I drove my rental car across the street to the Hertz facility. The downstairs lounge is typical FS, just cross it to go to the Lobby on the 7th floor, also typical FS with the usual albeit beautiful flower arrangements. No line at check-in. Attendant took care of us, and accomodated our requests ; indeed, we got a lake view from the 42nd floor. SUITE 4219 was not small. A better job could have been done furnishing the rather large sitting room. Smaller bedroom with KB, and surprisingly compact marble bathroom. The lot recently refurbished in an understated way of grey tones. Not overjoyful. View was awesome. We loved the seating available along all windows. Although I might be sometimes scared of height, I enjoyed spending some time there, and felt perfectly comfortable. Luggage turned up a couple of minutes after we were in the room. They alert a lot about the wind noises. We noticed some squeaking, but honestly it is no big beal, at least to us, even in the small of morning for us jetlagged european. FOOD : the only food we experienced was breakfast. Even by Four Seasons standards, this one is right up there at the top. It is outstanding value for money : coffee + juice + any egg dish + muffin sets you back $29, a bargain in my view. They have specials (recommend the King crab Benedict, although I only understood why they did not write BenedictS when they brought it : there is only one ... !). But eveyday menu is splendid already. I think we got the best smoked salmon and bagel in our entire life : fabulous salmon is one thing, but pretty standard, but caviar cream made a world of a difference. My mouth waters at the thought only. CONCIERGE made good recommendations. HOUSEKEEPING is a bit hit or miss. Some day, they arrange the furniture in a weird way. At turndown, they would not empty the trash cans. Sometime the bath disappears, and comes back the next day. Stationery which we used on day 1 was never replaced. There is lack of consistency, and probably also of supervising here. We are loyal Four Seasons customer. Usually when there is a Four Seasons, this is where we are going to stay. Over the past 12 months, we spent 14 vacation nights in various properties (Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Scottsdale, Hampshire UK). And this has been going on for years. We love the locations, the style, the service, the designs, the food, the ambience ; all these have a price tag which I am more than willing to pay around the world (Provence, Maldives, NYC, D.C., Singapore, Langkawi, ...), the highest in the industry. We know that we will not be disappointed. And nevertheless, we tend to be : there is no recognition of loyalty, whatsoever. Stinginess ? Probably ... Each time, there is just one set of toiIetries that we have to share between the shower stall and the bath tub. Plenty more come up when we ask for them, but this should not happen, or at least this should be in our profile -which we always use when booking. In Chicago, we never had some welcome fruit, any fresh flowers, not even a bottle of water by the bed any given night. Come on guys, should you take for granted that we stay with you ??? But one thing really goes on my nerves, which we experienced in L.A. and again in Chicago : being offered an upgrade for a fee. The desk attendant made it clear what a bargain $250 were to upgrade to a One-bedroom Suite, saving me $300 or so. First of all, I can book beforehand what I feel like staying in, and they make me feel cheap. Furthermore I am getting sick of the big dollard hunt Four Seasons are now practising. I feel that if there are availabilities, they should comp the loyal customers. Or shut the hell up ! This will not, not yet at least, prevent me from staying at other FS properties. I already have a set of bookings for next summer. But im my opinion, what is obvious company policy should be mellowed towards making the customers valued.

You don't even need to leave the building to shop. Now for the hotel itself -- The entrance for their Residences and the actual hotel are in the same location. When you enter the building you have to take an elevator ride to the 7th floor to enter the lobby area. Then you have to take a 2nd bank of elevators to get to your room. It's a minor inconvenience but I can see where some people might get frustrated from this. Also, the guests really don't hang out in the lobby area. The room was the right size for us. My daughter is 14 and we like to have our own separate areas. They had a treat for her each night. When we arrived there was a box of popcorn and a coke in ice. The next night they delivered a cupcake and lastly was a marshmellow and chocolate treat. Very nice touch! The view was great but on the first night of our visit it was a bit windy from a cold front moving and it seemed as if the building was rocking and rolling all night. They have a card in the room letting you know that the building is supposed to sway and there may be some noises. We were awakened several times that first night but the rest of the visit was quiet. The room wasn't overly luxurious but was quite comfortable. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but everything was clean. The carpet is looking a bit worn though.

Not only did they greet her by name, every time we returned to our room they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d left her a little treat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a toy, some sweets, popcorn, special bath items, and near the end of our stay they left her a dessert from the restaurant with a Happy Birthday greeting. She appreciated it so much. When we arrived back home, she said she was a little disappointed there weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any surprised waiting for her. So all in all, this was an amazing hotel. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the spa services because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not my thing, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m quite sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be fabulous yet non-pretentious.", "Date": "August 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkeley, California", "Title": "\u201cWould Definitely Return\u201d", "Author": "EmilyWaugh", "ReviewID": "UR70822239", "Content": "This is an excellent hotel right in the middle of everything in downtown Chicago.

I use this site religiously and always try to book the highest rated property that is within my price range. Luckily, for my recent trip to Chicago, I was traveling with a budget that allowed for some costs to be reimbursable within a certain price range, including hotel. This fact allowed me the luxury of staying at the Four Seasons and it was a luxury indeed. As I entered the main lobby (and each subsequent time I traveled through it) I was impressed with the sleek and modern floral displays that I have come to equate with Four Seasons properties. Upon check-in, I was upgraded to a suite on the 36th floor (room 3608), which had breathtaking wrap around views of the city skyline. This was a real treat! When I travel on my own and am lucky enough to be staying at a Four Seasons property, I like to order a cheeseburger off of their room service menu, since they are amazingly delicious, and this time was no exception. The room was spotless and the bed was honestly one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom was spacious and well stocked, as was the room's closet (there was even a humidifier in there!). My stay lasted a total of 3 nights and each day my room was made up and turned down whilst I away, no hassle. Also, when I requested assistance from the Concierge on accessing my online boarding pass for my flight home, she was happy to print it out for me and happily gave me directions to where I wanted to go, along with a nice small street map. Overall, I had a fantastic stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. I've read some of the other reviews and noticed one about the water being turned off - on Sunday night when I returned to my room around 10pm there was a note under the door informing me that my water would be off the following day from 9am - 4pm, but since my flight home the following morning (Mon) was departing very early, this didn't really impact me. Perhaps my positive feelings about this hotel would be diminished if I were indeed effected, but who is to say. What I do know is that I had a fantastic stay in a lovely property located in a great part of Chicago. The hotel is attached to a mall, which was very convenient when I had to run out and buy a dress last minute - you can always count on Bloomingdales! Also, I would be remiss if I failed to give a proper shout out to the great people at Bobby's Bike Hike Bike Tours! I learned about them here on TA and am very glad that I decided to book a bike tour with them. Randy was an amazing tour guide and their neighborhoods tour showed me sights in Chicago that I have never seen before in a way that allowed me to truly experience the city's beauty.

Beside the view however the room lost any such flash; it was very standard without much in the realm of design. Maybe this is what the Four Season's is known for. We settled in and ordered room service which was prompt and very expensive, I'm ashamed to even write the total. The food was very good and I recommend the burger highly. A day or two later we ordered breakfast and were very happy with the results; it's always aces when your eggs arrive hot. I had an asparagus egg white omelet that was delicious.

On the bad - we had problems with room service multiple times - once the order wasn't complete, twice they ignored the number of people we had and didn't bring enough place settings and were really inconsistent with what was offered - one day, large bowl of berries, the next, small; one day lots of bagels, next day, one. More concerning was the housekeeping. We had one bottle of shampoo when we arrived and one soap. for the sink, the shower and the tub. No washcloths were left and not enough towels. An old cup of coffee was never removed (through both turndown and regular service) and a bottle of champagne sat in a lukewarm bucket of water that was never replenished with ice and that soaked through to the table.

My company was in town for the Kitchen and Bath Show and booked through the convention at a great rate.

The hotel is in the perfect shopping area of Michigan avenue in a safe and prime location on top of Bloomingdale's and other stores. The lobby is a short elevator ride up from the street and is the start of the luxury. Marble and crystal are everywhere. At check-in, the desk agent offered us an upgrade to a suite for 30$ more a day. I jumped at the offer and it did not let me down. My room was 4003 on the 40th floor. (btw, even the elevators seem luxurious.) My room was absolutely perfect!! I really can't find a flaw with it. The room consisted of a decent sized living room with desk, sofa, and chair.A large window with windowseat looked out into the fog (As I mentioned, it was raining and nasty outside and the wind was howling.) From what I could see, I could tell that when the rain cleared, my view was going to be fantastic. The adjoining bedroom was large and featured a DIVINE bed and chaise. I was struck by the quality of furnishings and everything looked like it was recently updated. I enjoyed waking up to my own music on the ipod alarm clock that was very easy to set. The dressing area had a bench and mirrors that functioned well for the morning routine. The bathroom was roomy and had marble and good lighting. The L'Occataine products smelled great. The room was perfectly clean!! I use to work in the industry and cleaning perfection is rare if not impossible, but there wasn't the slightest trace of anything amiss in this room. The only thing that I think anyone might complain over is the building noise. Chicago is the windy city and it lived up to it's name that night. As all modern skyscrapers are designed to be flexible in high winds, the Four Seasons has some creaking noises that can be quite noticeable in high winds. It didn't bother me as it reminded me of the rocking of a cruise ship. And the bed kept me cradled and pampered all night long. In the morning, the sun was out and I took in a fantastic view of Lake Michigan and the cityscape including the Hancock Center across the street.

Very polite every time we encountered them and the concierge recommended an outstanding steakhouse (david burkes) that everyone in my family loved.

We are from Canada and decided because of our strong CDN$ that we would do a 3 day weekend of shopping, dining.....and yes, having fun. The 4S for the most part did not disappoint. Check in: On arrival to the hotel, the bellman guided us to the elevator that whisks one up to the hotel lobby which is several floors up. Upon exiting the lift, gracious surroundings await you. Front desk staff was prompt and courteous. We had booked the \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" package for our 3 day stay. Our 1 bedroom suite that we had reserved was not ready.....no problem, we were early and we were hungry. They would contact us when our suite was available. We moved over to the Conservatory where we had a lovely lunch and discussed our upcoming plans. I was contacted by cell that our suite was indeed ready. We went to the front desk and collected our keys and were told that the bellman and our luggage would accompany us to our room. Now here's the glich....Previously,I had phoned and been in direct contact with the hotel regarding the type of suite vs. connecting rooms, etc. that we should secure. Under advisement from hotel reservations (not central ressies) we booked a 1-bedroom suite. Now I am a Type AA traveller that likes to have everything in order. I had preordered a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our suite to kick off our expedition. Imagine my (and my friends) horror when we walked into our suite and I gasped,\"Oh my, pink carpet!\" Believe me, it got worse. I had specifically asked for a renovated suite and I ended up in a scary, 80's,pink carpetted, stained furniture suite.....at the FOUR SEASONS!! Needless to say, my friends and I wanted to bolt!! Yes, our champagne was waiting, but who felt like indulging?? We apologized to our bellman and told him to take our luggage away, as we would not be staying in this suite. A phone call to the front desk, did NOT deliver, \"I am sorry, Dr.XXXX, we will relocate you right away.\" Rather, the hotel is fully committed, I am not sure what we can do. Our weekend was not starting out the way that we wanted. One hour later, an associate came up from the front desk to show us 2 options. We all wanted a separate bed, so offering us 2 king bedded rooms cancelled the first option. The second option was an executive suite beside (not connecting) to a 2nd room. Okay...this will work. Now, apparently there is an upcharge. I am sure the total look of aghast, prompted them to see what they could do......Thankfully, our rates were left as we were quoted! So, here is the rub. We had just wasted 2 hours of our precious time without husbands and children on room negotiations. NOT the Four Seasons treatment, that I would have expected, but then, Dear Readers, check out my review at the 4S on Lanai (mousey area that prompted inexcusable response from management....I will never ever return there!!!) Okay, so we were checked in. We all took the elevator down to Bloomingdales (which is right below the hotel. Things are looking up :) Suites and Room: Thankfully, freshly decorated and very clean. Linens were lovely. The rooms have a decidely contemporary cool ( i.e. no warmth kind of cool.) Really, absolutely no complaints after our first looksee!! Washrooms were elegant in lovely marble. Robes and slippers and soft jazz greeted us as we were ready to turn in for the evening. Nice. Package: We loved the concierge ladies who assisted with our GJWHF package. Our day at NM with amkeover and personal consultant was fun! We loved our martini man who came one evening to our suite and indulged us with a favourite martini. Nice touch! Location: The hotel commands a great location on Michigan Avenue. We loved that we could shop and bring our treasures back to our suite/room and head back out again. You can't beat Chicago for shopping!! Restaurants/Lounges: Excellant food but sometimes spotty service. Nice music in lounge in the evening. Exercise Facilities: Small, but well appointed and very clean. Managed to get 2 workouts in during our stay. Overall: Would I stay here again? Maybe.... I would certainly check out the rates at the Park Hyatt and compare with 4S. After our rocky start, we did enjoy our stay. Sadly, our first impressions (and my other recent stay in Lanai), will not guarantee that I am a forever loyal 4S client.

We booked a kids in the city weekend and the add-ons with it were very useful. Kids could order free off the in-room children's menu. We had dinner one night and breakfast both mornings in the room. The price was high (for the 2 adults), but worth it for the quality of the food (excellent) and the convenience of having some casual meals with the kids. Both afternoons when we came back to the room, treats were left for the girls. When we first arrived, there were cookies and chocolate milk, a board game, crayons and an activity book as well as two kid-sized robes. My kids loved those robes! Also, the hotel arranged a trip from the ice cream man. He arrived at our door with a full cart decked out with ice cream and a dozen topping choices. I'd like to say the museums will be the strongest memory my kids will have of this trip, but in actuality, they'll remember the ice cream man for much longer. The package also had special discounts at local retailers (we only took advantage of the American Girl Place special - a free piece of doll's clothing) and free admission for one child to many local museums (we used several of these and saved over $50). The prices at the Four Seasons are high so we appreciated the little extras that were so thoughtfully included in their rates. Three other notes: 1) The location was excellent right in the midst of the Michigan shopping extravaganza. 2) The pool is another highlight for kids (the adults liked it too). So many city hotels either skip pools entirely, put them in the unattractive, airless sub-basement or link up to a sports club where only lap swimming adults are welcome. The Four Seasons has a lovely, spacious pool on the 8th floor with lots of natural light and a big hot tub. 3) The concierge was extremely helpful, getting us several last minute reservations.

The room was lovely and we were very glad that we took the offer to upgrade. The room was was divided into two areas seprated by double doors. There was a lounge area with a sofa and comfy chair and office area in the corner. The bedroom was nicely done and the linen felt so soft on the skin. Each room had a plasma T.V. screen. The bathroom was a decent size with a separate bath (with enough room for two!) and shower area, with a power shower, of course.

It was an AMAZING experience. We were offered an upgrade on arrival (for a small fee) to a one bedroom suite (we had booked an executive suite), but upon checking the rooms out, our exec suite was beautiful and had a much better view than the 1-bed bigger room so we kept the smaller one (which was far from small I might add, and overlooked Lake Michigan). With a small child there was plenty of room, and each night we had milk/cookies ready for her before bed. The bar area is gorgeous - if you like old fashioned sumptuous surroundings with accompanying pianist then you will love this place. The staff are amazing and remembered what we like to drink and gave our daughter so much attention - her favourite past-time was dancing next to the piano (and she even sat next to the pianist one night!). Pool is gorgeous and the gym is ok - a bit small, but fine for a few work-outs. Location is superb - next to the beach/loads of restaurants/near Lincoln Park and is on Mag Mile next to Macy's and all the designer boutiques. Don't miss out on the Sunday brunch - we forgot and ate breakfast about 1/2 hour too early in the other dining room - the brunch buffet looked fantastic and if you've got kids they have a supervised Harry Potter actitivity which gives parents an hour or so to themselves.
