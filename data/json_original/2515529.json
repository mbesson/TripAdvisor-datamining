We even said we would wait until he opened, but he said he would be happy to serve us before opening.

Here are my comments: Checking In: After flying overnight from Honolulu, I arrived at the hotel at about 11:00 am. The gentleman that assisted me was very helpful and the best part was he was able to check me in early. Something I really appreciated considering I cannot sleep on the plane. The person told suggested I drive around the building becasue the elevator was closer to the back door. Room: I was in the standard room on the third floor. If my memory serves me correctly, there was only three floors and I had the room facing the back of the hotel so there was no noise at night. The room had a refrigerator and the internet worked well. Location: As others have mentioned, this hotel is located in a business area, with several companies in the surrounding area. The only restaurant I saw that was within a walking distance was a Karl Strauss Brewery. I did not go but it looked busy. Down the road (you could walk it, but there is a busy intersection and it's kind of hilly), there is a small shopping area that has a McDonalds, a food court, a bank, and some other businesses including a gas station. The food court closes at 4:30 with several other eateries closing later. I did not see a supermarket near by, however I did not ask the front desk for any. Downtown San Diego is about 15 miles away. If you don't have a car, it could take a while to get there. I drove to Pacific Beach and it took about 15 minutes. Pacific Beach is a beach community with several restaurants and grocery stores. I heard La Jolla is nearby, I did not check it out myself. I can say that Torrey Pines took me about 20 minutes to drive to and from during a week day afternoon. Negatives: The only minor negative was the entrance to the hotel. When you are driving, you might have to turn left into the drive. Most of the drivers was nice enough for me to drive in, but if you are there when the workers from the nearby building are going home, it can be kind of scary turning into the driveway. There is a second entrance as you go up the hill, but it was closed when I was there. As you can see, my only complaint was very minor. This Courtyard achieved it's purpose. If you stay here, I would recommend having a car especially if you wish to go to downtown San Diego. I did not try the public transportation, and maybe it might work for some of you. But to get around, it would be better with a car.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "cahill05", "ReviewID": "UR124883441", "Content": "We only stayed here on night but had a very enjoyable experience.

They have a Starbuck's in the lobby and we eat breakfast there in one of the booth tables that has it's own television. Before we headed out for the day we took a walk through the courtyard.

I called and they offered to move us but my son was badly sunburned so we just stayed the night and went to a full service one the next day. In their defense, the next one was $80 more and not that much different room-wise and we didn't have to pay $17 for parking or $10 for internet. It would've been nice to have gotten a breakfast for free but the buffet waiter let me just order a bagel. Otherwise you have to spend $10 for a buffet. Nice guy.
