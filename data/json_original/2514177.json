However, if you are seeking to make the hotel a part of your vacation, it's size and scope simply do not allow. On the first floor entry way is the breakfast area which is small and can be quite busy at certain times. It doubles as a \"sports bar\" at night but is never busy. There must be a dance club on the top roof because at night they reserve one elevator for traffic up and down and their was always a line of young people waiting to go up. The hotel has no pool, no spa, a fair wireless connection and very small spaces for exercise and such. Of course the city beckons, so it wasn't such a concern to me on this trip. I think it would be ideal for the business traveler, couples, friends and solo trips. Families who might necessary have to spend time in the hotel, might try somewhere else with more success.

It is your typical New York City hotel: contemporary and trendy in design, narrow hallways, and right on the border of everything you'd want to do in NYC. We were not impressed with the hotel staff. We stay in many hotels and the service at this particular location was not warm, nor was it friendly. When we visited the bar area to order food late on the night we first arrived, the gentleman in the bar was fabulously friendly (but there was a mix up with our bar tab--we paid cash that night for it and yet it ended up on our hotel bill and we STILL had to pay it again because the manager said once receipts from the bar were audited at the end of the month, they'd refund our money). We were awakened in the middle of the night by loud, laughing, obnoxious people who were, apparently, standing out in front of the elevators on our floor. It wasn't a snapshot of this noise, it went on for five minutes, ten minutes, and we were fed up enough to call the front desk to complain about the noise after 15 minutes. There are probably 10 rooms on a floor, maybe 15, but the small hallways make every noise very audible inside the rooms. The front desk associate acted as though our request to silence the noise outside of the elevators was uncalled for and as though WE were being an imposition by asking for assistance at 3 am. Within five minutes, the family in the room next to ours, with young children, were getting a strong, sturdy knock on their door telling them we (specifically mentioned our room number) had complained about noise from that room. Never did we mention our hotel neighbor as being noisy. We were the only two rooms at that corner of the hall! What a great reunion that next morning was when we all went to breakfast at the same time. A hotel associate's error could've made for a potentially heated moment. The room itself was nice (King size bed). The view was straight into a construction zone across the street. The included breakfast was probably the best thing they offered.

The staff was friendly and helpful, the facilities spotlessly clean, and the location convenient even though it is on a seedy section of 40th St. It is sandwiched between two other nice hotels, though, so there are quite a few travelers walking that way so its not deserted. But, the area still might turn some people off as you have to walk by a sketchy liquor store and some peep shops to get to the hotel. But just look the other way because once you are in the hotel that disappears. The lobby is really slick with white marble floors and banquettes and chairs upholstered with a glam metallic sheen fabric. And there is a nice fireplace in the lobby too! The breakfast area in the back is also very nicely appointed and converts to a friendly bar at 5PM; lots of TV's to watch sports and news. We enjoyed the free wine and beer on the Tues. and Wed. nights we were there, and they put out food too. Granite counters in the bar and bathrooms are a nice updated touch. The breakfast in the morning was very busy but had everything you'd want; eggs, sausage, breakfast sandwiches, fruits, yogurts, juices, baked goods...the staff running it was really on the ball with the refills too. There is free coffee/tea/hot chocolate down there 24/7 too and everyone makes good use of that throughout the day. My overall impression of the way this hotel is run is that they know you might not stay there again if they don't get things right, (so many options!) so the staff are going out of their way to accommodate people. Great attitude! Our room was small but as I mentioned, very clean, and had a great view on the 27th floor. N ow here is a curious thing. On the top floor of the hotel there is a rooftop nightclub. So starting at 6PM one of the elevators is commandeered by serious looking bouncers and a velvet rope goes up cordoning off a section of the lobby as a coatroom and security check area for nightclub goers. This did not present a problem to us, it was just unusual. One night we did drop our teen off in our room and go up for a drink to check it out (no cover charge on Tuesday night!). It was not crowded at that time but still the folks at the club were very different that the businessman/tourist crowd who stays at the hotel! Being 50-somethings we felt a bit out of place but enjoyed our martinis (don't even want to know what they cost, my friend expensed them, but judging by the fact that in the casual \"breakfast area bar\" downstairs a martini is $21, I shudder to think). If you are staying there on a night when there is no cover charge and you can go up early before there's a line, I would definitely check this place out for the views are breathtaking with floor to ceiling glass in some areas. It is something to see. And if you are a club-goer type then this is really a great hotel for you to stay at because you'll be right there! But I digress from the hotel. I will absolutely stay there again. It is great value, great location, clean, near fun things, nice people. A favorite for the Times Square area., Though we took public transportation to the city, this hotel is also right across the street from Port Authority with the best deal on parking I've found in NYC so if you drive in check that out. I was torn about whether to give 4 or 5 stars because nothing is perfect and the location and tiny room thing are a bit of a drag.

In the evening they also set aside one of the 3 elevators for the nightclub so sometimes you might have to wait for an elevator but it was never too excessive.The complimentary breakfast was about as expected with very good scrambled eggs but the sausage links were dried out.

Lots of drawers and a wardrobe to hang your clothes. There seemed to be plenty of outlets for plugging in electronics. Probably the best surprise was that each room has a fully functional AC/Heat that you can control. This is wonderful because with most NYC hotels you are stuck with a overheated room. The windows also opens a crack for fresh air. The rooms are clean and quiet and have a very modern bathroom. There are only 2 inconveniences to note. There is no wifi in the rooms so if you have an ipad or other wireless device you will have to go to the lobby to get internet and the ice machine is in the lower lobby which means you will have to go down there whenever you need ice. I think they could greatly improve the ice service by letting you pick up an ice bag at the front desk on your way into your hotel so you don't have to make two trips to the room. Just to note, there is a parole center on this street, but they only line up in the morning. I always felt safe in this area and don't feel this is a problem at all.

I have stayed in other Fairfield Inns across the country in the past and didn't expect this one to be so much nicer, but it was. I went to NYC for a travel blogging meet up, alone, and I don't usually travel alone, so this was a new experience to me. The location wasn't really the greatest in my opinion, too far west and too close to Times Square for my taste, near a Parole office, didn't feel that safe but I'm paranoid about these things. The hotel was going through some renovations in the lobby and the fact that its entrance is shared with the Sky Room, which is accessible to the general public, made it a bit confusing (I had to show I was a hotel guest to get in every night to bypass the queue for the Sky Room). The room was definitely a much nicer room than I expected from a Fairfield Inn, fairly new, much better decorated than any other Fairfield Inn I've been to (meaning = it tried to be nice versus just plain simple), good bathroom (also very new), decent size for NYC, it was a nice surprise. It was quiet (elite floor), very comfortable bed, I had a complaint on the first night about some hair in a towel, but after that everything was very clean. Breakfast at the Sky Room was OK, they had a decent selection for a complimentary breakfast but in a weird seating arrangement, with a very nice view.

We had no problems with cab driver finding the location. Check in was quick, and our room was ready to check in at 10:30 am- very unexpected. We anticipated having to check our bags with the concierge, which was an available service. We may have received a priority treatment on room availability because we have Marriott Gold status and they sent us an email the day before asking when we were going to be there. Regardless, we were pleased they could accomodate. The hotel has a small but very updated and modern lobby area which makes a good impression. It was snowy and rainy while we were there, and someone was continually mopping and drying the floor. In the evening, half of the lobby doubles as the queue for the SkyBar on the top level of the hotel. Our room was on the 27th floor, one king bed. The room was small, but typical for NYC standards. It was clean and well equipped and everything was in good repair. Amenities include in room safe, Starbucks coffee to brew in the room, good bedside reading lamps, desk and workstation, typical bathroom amenities, nice fluffy white towels. We had a great city view from our room. The only complaint was an extra sitting chair that was way too big, not necessary and completely in the way. My spouse could barely get out of his side of the bed because the chair and the side table took up so much room. But that was a small thing, really. Might also be a tight fit if you are traveling with several large suitcases. Because the hotel was in close proximity to many restaurants, we didn't eat at the hotel free breakfast. You will not have to search too far for any type of food that you might want to eat. The hotel is a two block walk to times square, there is a subway entrance right on the corner, and the bus terminal is directly across the street so transportation options are plentiful.

The Fairfield Inn is on the cusp of the theatre district between 8th and 9th Avenune. Since we frequent Marriott hotels, this was a no brainer. We checked in at 11 AM on Saturday. If they didn't have a room available we could have checked our grip and be on our way. Room was small but normal for Manhattan. (We've stayed in some really small rooms in Manhattan but lets face it, you're here for the sights. You sleep in your room). The room was laid out well with everything you needed. Bedding was fine. The room was clean. The bathroom is small with a nice glass enclosed shower instead of a bath tub. The door to the bathroom has milk glass but is fine unelss you are extremely modest. This wasn't an issue at all. Towels were nice and fluffy for a Fairfield Inn. Elevators were a tad slow but again, this is NY. Our 31st floor room had a view of the Empire State Building if you leaned to the right. Again, this is NY with lots of tall buildings. In any hotel, you usually get a view of a building across the street or an air shaft. It's just the way it is in Manhattan. Breakfast was fine. In fact better than the usual Fairfield Inn breakfasts you find in other hotels. As for food, there is no restaurant in the hotel since Fairfield Inn's don't have restaurants but you won't go hungry. You are a couple of short blocks to the theatre district and restaurant row. However, my wife and I go to 9th Avenue and walk north where there are dozens of restaurants of every ethincity including Thai, Indian, Turkish, Italian, Greek, French and the list goes on. This is where the New Yorkers eat. You won't go wrong here. Face it. You didn't come to New York to eat in Applebys or Baba Gumps. As for location, you next to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and a half a block from the 42nd St subway station. We came by public transportation but if you come by car they have a deal with a parking garage two doors away for around $28 for 24 hours. In this part of Manhattan, the norm is at least $40 and no garage offers in and out privliges. Remember, this is New York and not Omaha. Besides, if you go anywhere in Manhattan you use public transportation or a cab as there is no place to park. Their breakfast room doubles as a bar after 5 PM that has all the appeal of an institution.

It held up to everything it promises; Easy check in, clean comfy rooms, friendly staff, free hot breakfast, smooth check out at noon. We had no issues during our stay outside of normal policies. However, we have been Marriott rewards members for over 7 years, and made a few requests before check in. We had requested early check in for a standard double room, on a high floor, and in the corner facing away from street. We were not granted any of the above. We attempted to check in at noon, and were told only king rooms available. I left a cell number, at their request, to be called when ready. At 2pm I called the front desk and still nothing available. At 3:15 we walked back in and there was a room available, but never received a call, and I doubt we would have. Early check in is not guaranteed, but we have received better attention elsewhere. We traveled with my mother who had knee surgery and cannot stand or walk for long periods. Parking is not as bad as it seems, for the city. The lot is really right next door but does service the other two hotels on street, which are all right next to each other. And there is no in and out service. Parking is not free, hotel will validate for a discount, we paid $28 for 24 hours. The room was comfy as expected by Marriott but small. Just enough room for furniture, no room to leave anything out. Bathroom is tiny, but has everything you need. Walk in glass shower, great hot water and pressure. The bathroom door itself is made with opaque glass that's really kind of see through. You can definitely see inside if standing by door! And bath is right when you walk in to your room, so again no real space at all. But keep in mind, it is NY and for that fact the room is more than adequate. We were on the 10th floor, and could still hear the streets below. Not enough to keep you awake. We had a very small window facing the bus terminal across the street. Location of this hotel is very convenient to times square area. Walk a few blocks and you are in the middle of it all. The street location of hotel is pretty bare and ugly. Feels like it's on a side alley, mainly because of bus terminal. There are a few restaurants nearby, chines, pizza. And a pharmacy on corner. Oh, the sky room bar was not open, closed Sunday and Monday, so we did not experience. The bar lounge area, which also hosts breakfast, was open. We peeked inside to see a small bar,one bartender but plenty of room to sit for some drinks. Breakfast the next morning was until 10am. They served hot scrambled eggs, sausage, cereals, bagels, juices, microwaved sandwiches ect. Pretty good, but very busy of course. The staff was attentive and courteous.

As it turns out, Four Points actually picked up my tab (so the night was free)! Kudos to Starwood. This is really a review of Fairfield Inn, though. As some of the other reviews indicate, the area west of Times Square is a little bit edgy-er compared to the areas closer to Central Park (but the hotels near Central Park are MUCH more expensive). I was pleasantly surprised at the value of the Fairfield in. The location is not an issue. It's actually about 2 blocks from the theaters and Times Square. It was a little bit of a walk up to work (1.5 miles). For me, a runner, no issue. The only issue to consider is that a cab from LaGuardia would have to cross MidTown to the west side (a little longer trip). This hotel is not large - very small lobby. But that really doesn't matter to me. (The Hilton MidTown Mahattan has a big lobby but it is a terrible hotel.)The hotel staff was efficient and professional and even called me up in my room to see how things were. The room was nicely appointed. Great HDTV. Tiled bathroom. Extremely clean. No wifi, but free internet via the LAN cord.

I know things are more expensive in this area and I expect to pay more for things, but to charge the price a of full bottle of Vodka for each shot, thats some markup. The next night, we went in again and were only charged $10 per drink. The bartender that night said that the previous bartender was wrong. I complained at the front desk, and was told the next day that the first was tender was correct and the the second time were had not been charged for the lime juice, just the Vodka. Never hear of that before. Mixers aren't charged separately. Enough about that already. Overall, I think the hotel was great. I wouldn't consider the rooms \"spacious\" especially for 3 adults, but we made do.l If one is sitting at the desk, they would have to move for another to get to the other side of the room. Tiny bathroom. Reminded us of bathrooms in Paris. Again, the best parts of the hotel are its location and the staff. Good beds, good linens, good bath towels and washcloths.

Room was clean and comfortable and the front desk was very pleasant and helpful. About a 15 minute walk to NY Public Library and 5th Avenue shops. About 20 minute walk to Rockefeller Center. Times Square is about 5 minutes. I felt very safe walking back to the hotel around 7 pm on on a Sunday evening. The other reviewers are correct in that there are a few adult book/video stores on the street, but they did not have any window displays or anyone hanging around handing out literature like there are in Times Square. The breakfast area was very nice and well stocked with a variety of egg sandwiches, cereals, bagels, oatmeal, fruit, etc. Hot coffee/tea is available in the breakfast area 24/7. The best amenity of the hotel is the free internet although it was only available via Ethernet hook up in the room (not wireless) and therefore I needed to remain at the desk instead of using the computer on the bed, but none the less, it worked great and was not an extra charge. My only complaint (more of a city complaint) is that the taxi's do not like to go down (up?) West 40th street. Upon arrival, I was dropped off at the corner of 8th & 40th and told to walk a few buildings down to the hotel. I needed a taxi in the morning, and the bellman tried like heck to flag down a taxi for me and none would stop! I ended up walking up to the bus station and getting in the line for the taxi stand there. I would definitely stay here again. A few weeks ago I was in NY for business and stayed at the Hilton Times Square. For half the cost, the Fairfield Inn & Suites, by far, succeeded the Hilton in every way - except one - and that was room size...but who stays in their room when in New York City anyway?

European guests will be somewhat bewildered by the hot selection which consists of pre-wrapped bacon or sausage sandwhiches which one simply places in the microwave and heats up.

Need a second mortage to eat at Inayka (on 40th St just across from 8th Ave) and Keene's on 34th or 36th St. Both good but expensive. Not something I'd do at home but a good treat on vacation. Also had lunch at Becco's which was ok. There are lots of restaurants on 9th Ave between 40th and 55th.

Like many smaller NYC hotels, they do not have enough elevators to handle the traffic and number of floors - so be prepared to wait and potentially stop at every floor if you are going in or out during a busy part of the day. The room was average and probably a bit larger than most NYC hotel rooms. The design of their stall shower (at least in the room I had) needs to be re-evaluated - you basically have to almost get inside of the shower stall to turn the water on thanks to a poorly positioned glass wall, so you get a lovely burst of cold water on you before you have the ability to adjust the temp. The breakfast area was packed and noisy, but they offered a good selection of items. There were a few random homeless people taking advantage of the free food but that happens at a lot of hotels.... Location is not ideal but not horrible either. You will be on 40th between 8th and 9th. So you basically have to walk 2 long blocks east and a few blocks north to really be in what I would consider \"times square\". The farther west you go I do find that area to be a little less desirable, so I'm not sure if I'd want to be out walking to my hotel there at 2am - but if you are out at reasonable hours it seems safe. There was a parole office on the same block, so I think you do get some interesting characters around because of that vs. a more busy touristy street, plus you are right at the port authority bus station - so yeah, it's not central park east....

Be advised that breakfast time is very crowded and there is very little sitting space since the hotel is very small. The only things that I disliked about this hotel were the elevators. They are very slow and since the hotel is 25 or so floors and only 6 rooms per floor it takes forever to get to the lobby especially during peak hours and if you are coming from a higher floor. I stayed on the 23rd floor and trying to get to the lobby on a Sat morning literally took me 10 min since we stopped at every floor. I would recommend getting a lower floor if at all possible.

The lobby and lounge were being refurbished on our arrival, not a prblem in itself but it meant that breakfast was served in the roof top bar - a bit of a mare eating on your knees at coffee tables but this is only a temporary measure and drawings of the new breakfast area look very nice. Continental breakfast was good but could have included some cold meats and cheese other than Philadelphia.

However annoyingly the rooms didn\u2019t have hairdryers despite saying so on the hotel website. The staff were fantastic - polite, friendly and incredibly helpful. The Skyroom Bar has an entrance directly to the street with a bouncer outside all night so you feel very secure if returning late - guests have priority access.

The breakfst room has been moved to the nightclub area and seating can be tough when it is buzy, but that will end with the rennovation.

Don't expect a cooked-to-order breakfast or even a hot buffet, but for the price (i.e., included in your rate), it's a pretty good deal.

I usually go to New York City at least once every year and I like the hotel to be in the Times Square Area as it makes getting around New York on the Subway easier as just about every line goes through here. I actually liked that this particular hotel was a few blocks from 42nd Street and Broadway as it was on a quieter street between 8th and 9th Avenues. It was right next to the Port Authority with a daytime entrance just across the street. There are two adult video stores on the street, but their windows are solid white and I only saw 1 person go into the store the three days we were there. If this kind of stuff bothers you, go through the Port Authority (entrance open until 8pm) or just walk on the other side of the street at night. The hotel has 30 floors but we stayed on the 10th so I can't say much about the view, all we saw was the parking lot for the Port Authority. We did have breakfast in the Sky Lounge and there is a nice view of Hell's Kitchen and the Hudson River from up there. Breakfast is rather spartan in my opinion. The only fruit available were bananas and apples. They also had bottled apple juice, orange juice and fresh coffee. I thought the blueberry muffins were ok. I tried to have a bagel the first day but the toaster was broken. They did have oatmeal and cereal which I did not try. I did try the frozen quiche and the frozen bagel sandwich the second day, but I did not care for them (not such a fan of frozen food). Thus on the third day my wife and I went elsewhere for breakfast. I liked the size of the rooms and the HD TV. The TV gets 15 HD channels (networks/basic cable) and like 25 standard definition channels. There was ample drawer space and closet room for two people. The shower was nice and while there was not much room on the sink counter, there was plenty underneath it. I also liked the iPod dock/alarm clock. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows were too soft in my opinion and there was no blanket provided (however we never asked to see if we could get one).

We read many of the reviews on tripadvisor prior to booking (sex shops on what seems like a \"seedy\" street), so we were a bit hesitant, since we would have a small child with us. I'm pleased to say it was \"Much Ado About Nothing\". This hotel is absolutely fine for a quick getaway on a budget. Yes, it is on a street with some sex shops, so if that absolutely bothers you, then i wouldn't recommend it. But there is another hotel next door (Four Points Sheraton, I think), sandwich shops 3 buildings down the street and the port authority of New York across the street. We walked up and down this street (40th street between 7th and 8th avenues) with a small child during the day and had no cause for concern whatsoever. The hotel itself is more than adequate. The lobby is nice, you get free continental breakfast and free internet in the lobby (only 3 computers as of this writing). The rooms were of average size for a New York hotel. Bathrooms were clean and bed was comfy. They have sort sort of \"rooftop\" or \"skyroom\" on the top floor, but you must wear a jacket/slacks to get it...and there may be a cover charg (if this is your thing). The hotel is walking distance (5 minutes) to the heart of Times Square, which is primarily why we chose it. But the other reason was the price...very affordable!!! To conclude, if you're looking for the perfect hotel to celebrate a special occasion, then you probably want to skip this hotel. But if you're looking for a more than adequate hotel that is reasonably priced, you can't beat this hotel....and if the sex shops scare you, just use common sense (no walking alone, be back in the hotel before it's dark or take a taxi to the hotel at night).

It was the most inexpensive Marriott branded hotel near Times Square. First, the location is great. From JFK airport, we took the Airtrain to the subway, then the subway to 42nd St/Port Authority bus terminal. It's $5 for the Airtrain and $2.25 for a single subway ride. From there, it is a quick 2 block walk to the hotel. To get back on the subway was even closer though - there is a stop right on the corner of 40th St next to the drug store. This is less than a 1 minute walk. This stop will get you to most places up and down Manhattan. The A, C, E, and 1-7 trains run from it. The A train goes up and down Manhattan while the E train will take you to the World Trade Center. A day pass is $8.25 and you can also use that on the city buses (note that NYC buses do not take dollar bills - you need a MetroCard or exact change in coins.) You can easily walk (about 15-20 minutes), or take a crosstown bus to 42nd St Pier and catch the Circle Line cruises or visit the USS Intrepid. There is a $1 per slice pizza stand on the corner which was surprisingly good for a quick bite of NYC pie. There are 2 adult video stores on the block of the hotel, but you can walk on the other side of the street to avoid them. The heart of Times Square is very close, with every Broadway theatre, restaurants, Madam Tussaud's, the bright lights and more nearby. Rockerfeller Center and Top of the Rock is within walking distance (50th St) as is the Empire State Building and Macy's (34th St). For the record, we enjoyed Top of the Rock much more than the ESB. Everyone working at the hotel was very friendy and helpful (as were most people we talked to in NYC contrary to the stereotypes). The room was small (in Manhattan this was expected) but still had more than enough room. We could see part of the Hudson River from our window which was nice. It will be nice when they open the rooftop which is currently under construction. They offer an awesome deluxe continental breakfast in the morning. It is served near the lobby and it does get crowded, but there is another room with extra seating. The breakfast is self serve and includes cereal, fruit cups, fresh fruit, bagels, coffee cake, english muffins, breakfast sandwiches, juice, Starbucks coffee, tea, and yogurt. Not only did this save us money from buying breakfast, it also saved a lot of time which was precious for a 3 day trip. They also have free cookies and ice water in the lobby in the evenings. There are 3 public computers in the lobby which were most often available, except in the morning when a lot of people were at breakfast. You can print from these computers although we could not print our boarding passes due to the security restrictions. The rooms also have free hardwired internet access although I did not a bring my computer with me (I didn't feel like keeping up with it and also knew the hotel had computers). They also have a fitness center, but walking around NYC will give you all the exercise you need. The beds were comfortable and the HD TV was nice too. The only minor problem we had was that the AC unit was very noisy. I found that if I turned it to fan only, it cooled the room sufficiently at night and was not as noisy.

The airconditioner is so loud it kept waking me up. Breakfast is continental and adequate for light breakfast. The breakfast area is cleaned and has a nice decor. It is a plus that they provide 2 computers to check e-mails and to print your boarding pass. Definitely they need to change the chairs in heir small lobby. It has a visible stain.

We flew into Newark and had already organised a shuttle transfer to the hotel through Super Shuttle (\u00a325 each)... although handy, it took a long time, dropping off at other hotels and taking different routes (so about 90 minutes in the end!) I'd recommend the Newark airport express bus that travels to the Port Authority Bus Station opposit the hotel. We did this on the way back and it cos $15 each (about \u00a310) Check in at the hotel was simple and the staff were incredibly friendly, providing us with a concierge map (that proved invaluable) and drawing on our location compared to places to eat and things to see etc. Our room was on the 13th floor at the front of the building and the only negative was that it was a bit noisy from the traffic below and in front (we were next to the exit of the bus station and building work was going on). If the room had been on the back of the hotel, or higher it would have been quiter. I didn't really have a problem, but my partner who is a light sleeper did struggle to sleep well. Aside from that everything else about the hotel was great. The room was large by NY standards with a king sized bed (with memory foam matresses) desk, 37\" LCD TV with many channels, coffee maker, heating/airconditioning unit, hairdryer, alarm clock, plenty of storage space and a lovely, stylish en-suite bathroom. The bed was made daily (unless you laid a card on the bed) and towels were replaced daily if you left them on the floor/in the bath (an energy saving policy). The complimentray breakfast started from 7am on weekends and 6.30am weekdays and consisted of bagels, muffins, pastries, fruit, cereal and yoghurts. However, if you got there a bit late it was very busy and tables were all taken but you can eat in the lobby where there are breakfast bars and comfy chairs. There were 3 computers with internet access linked to a printer in the lobby. We found this useful for planning places to go, checking in for our flights online and printing our boarding passes. A concierge was also available in the lobby to give advise/directions or book tickets/tables etc. The staff were all really helpful and approachable. The location of the hotel is great, despite being next to a Parole office... do not let that put you off though, its a really safe area, well lit and always busy. The hotel is only a few blocks from Times Square and Broadway and right next to 9th avenue (Hell's Kitchen) which offered an unending variety of places to eat... we had Thai and Mexican. My partner is vegetarian and he also had a wide variety of choices wherever we ate. Most of the other midtown things to see were within 15 minutes walk e.g. Empire State, Javits Centre, Rockefeller Plaza, Macy's, 5th Avenue shops, Madison Square Garden etc. Central Park took about 30 minutes (although this was also due to the many traffic lights you have to stop at at each block) There are several subway stops nearby (the closest at Port Authority) and I really would recommend taking the subway if your feet get tired. Its really clean, not that busy and fully air-conditioned... very different to the London Tube! We took the subway from Penn Station a few blocks down all the way to the Staten Island Ferry Terminal - it took about 10 minutes! You can purchase a 4 trip subway pass for $8, an unlimited day pass for $8.25 or and unlimited week pass for $27... well worth the money if you're going to be travelling around a lot! A couple of blocks up from the hotel along 8th Avenue is the Gray Line bus tour company (you see their reps on corners with Red (not yellow) jackets) You can purchase open top bus tours from them fo $44 for one tour or $54 for all their tours (downtown, uptown, brooklyn and night tours)... this is valid for 48 hours and are hop on, hop off. They were a great way to sight-see and give our feet a rest after we'd walked miles the first day! They also do more expensive offers that are valid for longer and include entrance to many attractions. When we returned to the hotel in the afternoons there was free hot chocolate and coffee facilities in the lobby, which was a really nice touch. The hotel is currently renovating the top floor of the building into a skybar with panoramic views and should be ready by the summer. Check out is 12pm and our flight wasn't until 8pm but the hotel does have a secure luggage storage room which we found really useful.

No noise from other guests, just the usual air-con machine and the outside noise.

There is also a coffee on tap in the lobby area, and 3 free pc's. Free internet access in the rooms, via a cable, and easy to use. Staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. My only \"wish\" would have been able to stay in the room longer, as we didn't get in when expected, and it would have been appreciated to have that time at the end of our stay as our flight wasn't until 9pm. We would have been charged $159 dollars to stay for an extra 5 hours, which I thought was expensive.

We were given a choice of room and we opted for one on the 25th floor. The view was great! We were booked to a room with just 1 double bed so the room wasnt massive but certainly big enough for us. This was the 3rd hotel Ive stayed at in NY and this room was the biggest of the 3 hotels. The room has all the usual (wardrobe, iron, press, hairdryer, tv, coffee), and was very clean. Complimentary toiletries in the bathroom were a nice touch. The breakfast was a pleasant surprise. Plenty of choice - about 5 cereals inc porridge, bread and bagels (option to toast), fresh fruit, yogurts, pastries, egg and bacon muffins as well as sweet muffins. All this including orange, cranberry or apple juice, water, or teas and coffee - all in all, Id say this was a good selection for a complimentary breakfast - something not many hotels offer. Breakfast area wasnt a large area but never had to wait for a table. Theres also a vending machine area on the lower ground floor - just $1 or $2 for bottled drinks and snacks, and theres also an ice machine.

Breakfast was good. In other reviews there was listed what they offer so I won\u2019t repeat that.

Room off to the side with computers is very helpful if you don't have your own though there are always people on them. Rooms are small - smallest I've seen in New York I believe. There were 3 of us, and with all our suitcases I found it a bit cramped. While we never really 'fell over' each other, it was hard to get organized in the morning with all 3 of us in the room. Therefore, we went down for breakfast in turns so there was more room to get ready in. Our room contained 2 double beds, the bathroom, a TV cabinet/closet and a desk. Well laid out for the size, just very tiny. Breakfast was a great addition with many items to enjoy. Cereal, baked goods, heated sandwiches, coffee/tea/juice, fruit and yogurt. Breakfast room could be busy at times, though we never had a problem finding a table. One thing to note, however, was the wait for the elevators during breakfast hours. Sometimes it took up to 10 minutes for one to arrive either on your floor, or in the lobby. One huge mention goes out to the staff - all front office staff were very friendly. Always said hello to us, and remembered who we were throughout our stay. Very helpful, and that is a good find in New York. Another positive mention goes out to the free internet in the rooms. The hotel is located on 40th street, bordering the south side of the Port Authority Bus Station. It is a fairly desolate street with adult video stores, a liquor store and a corrections office located on it. I never felt unsafe on it, though my mother remarked she would probably never walk down the street alone at night. Subway entrance, when open, is located at the corner of 40th and 8th Avenue. Overall, a nice hotel in a bit of a down area. Good value for the money, though not incredibly cheap.

Yes the street is creepy, but just keep a brisk walk and you'll be fine. This complex is actually brand spanking new, and a similar hotel is about to open its doors next door in a couple of months time. Then there will be three hotel towers on the street. So when the scaffolding will be gone, and there will be a lot more foottraffic moving along, that should take away more of the creeps.

I did see a lot of family's trying to get into the restaurants, but as they have a lot of 2 person tables, you might want to reserve so you don't miss your show.

I looked for a low cost hotel in Manhattan for a trip that I was attempting to do at as low cost as possible. I found an AAA rate of $119 per night for this property on the hotel website. The location was wonderful even though it looks out on the gigantic and ugly Port Authority Building and when turning left from the front door one encounters some less than lovely areas. However, if you make a right you are just a short block away from the hub-bub of Times Square. You do have to walk by an adult bookstore but as a solo female traveler I was not at all intimidated or bothered by anyone on the street and I was in and out at all hours with no problems.Go up a few blocks and turn left and you are in the Hell's Kitchen area where every type of dining experience awaits. I would not go into this area by turning left from the hotel only because you must walk under an underpass area by the Port Authority and a large crowd of men hang out in this area. I felt uncomfortable the one time I did try this route so I just walked right and up a block and then to the left from then on. Go into the Port Authority building and downstairs to the Subway -- so convenient!! The hotel room itself was small as NYC hotels are prone to be, but the space was well-designed. I would have liked another shelf in the bathroom--the very deep sink has no lip or shelf around it to speak of so storing my toiletries was a bit of a pain. There was no tub but the glass-doored shower had great water pressure and the door made the space seem larger than it was. The bed was comfortable. The view from the window was not wonderful but I could see the lights of the New Yorker building in the evening as well as the spire of the Empire State Building so it was not the worst view I have ever had out of a New York hotel. I could see blue sky and tried not to see into the windows of the nearby apartment building, but all in all I was happy. The folks at the hotel were great. One staffer would push the elevator button when she saw me coming in and often ask how my day had gone. the concierge found a great seat for me at Hair when I grew weary of standing in the half price line for tickets one day. Several times I asked them to make change for me which they did readily at the front desk and they were always cheerful. One day I needed utensils for take-out I had picked up and a staff person went in the back and came back with plastic forks, spoons, and knives. I was just so pleased by the caring attitude of the people at the hotel. They delivered a fridge to my room so i was able to buy take-out and food from markets and eat in when I chose. I did have a problem with other guests who allowed their children to spend great lengths of time on the lobby computers. These kids would be playing games when I needed to print my boarding passes and I think a sign that says please limit your usage of computers in consideration of other guests or something would help. There were two machines and one night a teenager was instant messaging her friends for more than an hour and I finally asked her if I could please have the computer just to check the schedule of one event and then i would return it to her. She grudgingly agreed. On the night I needed to print the pass i did not think the parents of the kids would ever allow me a turn, but they finally did leave with their kids in tow. I would definitely stay here again. The location is great. it is on a quiet street and there is little noise on the backside of the hotel. The rooms have nice flat panel TVs with premium channels, comfortable beds, and are very clean. There is a small wardrobe in the room--no closets and the dresser area has drawers to store clothes--there is free internet in the rooms and good lighting. The only thing I missed was the lack of room service but there was one menu of a nearby place that delivers and a list of places nearby that offered delivery so in a pinch that would do. Do try the ethnic places in hell's kitchen. I plan to write reviews of many of them when I get time as I had some great dining experiences at very low cost. The entire trip was just under a thousand dollars and it included multiple plays, transportation, great food and lodging for five days so I met my goal of biting off the Big Apple without breaking the bank!", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel\u201d", "Author": "ilantlv", "ReviewID": "UR37090586", "Content": "Overall I was pleasantly surprised from the hotel and it did not differ much from his more upscale sibling - the courtyard.
