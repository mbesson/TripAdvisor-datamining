However, the Four Seasons hotel in Toronto is a sad, pitiful joke. The restaurant (Avenue) has the rudest seating staff you could ever imagine. The restaurant manager is completely unconcerned about how badly customers are treated and is not at all interested in trying to set an example to the other employees. I will never, ever stay or dine at the Four Seasons in Toronto again. It is a poor excuse for a hotel and is doing a lot of damage to a brand that is known elsewhere as a five-star hotel chain.

Movie stars and the rich and famous flocked to it's rooms. Toronto is in the middle of a condo boom and now the Four Season's 4 stars need to be upgraded to five stars to complete with the plethora of 5 star hotels now open just south of the hotel. The hotel will be closing soon to make way for more condos and the 4 seasons is moving from Avenue Road a couple of blocks east to Bay St to earn its fifth star. SWMBO and I decided to spend Canada's Family Day at the grand old dame in the tony Yorkville neighbourhood. We don't stay in many 4 stars and as far as quality service, the hotel still earns it's status. Not so much with the rooms and public areas. Our room 1407 was in the southeast corner of the building. The views were quite spectacular of the mid-town part of Toronto. The room was adequately large with a nice faux antique desk, an armoire with the television and mini-bar, a queen size bed, a comfy overstuffed chair and a high quality sound system. The closet was a small walk in and there was a large balcony with cast iron furniture (too bad it's February). The health club is feeling a bit dated but both the whirlpool and the indoor/outdoor pool were warm and welcoming. There is no coffee makers in our room but the staff brought one up. They don't subscribe to the powdered 'whitening' trap, so you have to order the milk or cream separately. There is something to be said about drinking coffee black:. Fewer calories and you don't have to call for room service. The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. I certainly hope they will make the migration to the new building. Overall the night we spent at the hotel was most enjoyable. We dined at Bistro 990 (see separate review) and enjoyed walking through the streets of downtown Toronto late at night. Toronto may not be the most beautiful city in North America, and it's not the biggest, richest or most sophisticated. It is however, one of the safer cities and being able to walk to our restaurant and back through the university district was worth the price of admission.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Place to Stay in Yorkville Toronto\u201d", "Author": "LindaCC_10", "ReviewID": "UR125001144", "Content": "Recently stayed one night for a business event.

It was in many ways the first deluxe hotel anywhere that set new standards in service and staff excellence. The excellence of the service and staff attitude is still evident all these years later. It's scheduled to close sometime in 2012 when a new high-rise 4S opens a few blocks away - but until then it's still worth incorporating this hotel into your plans. The thing that struck me - is this hotel is spotlessly clean. The rooms - while a bit 70's-80's looking with repro antiques type furniture (and totally wacky Ikea type louvered wardrobe doors) are very well kept. You could probably get on your hands and knees with a magnifying glass and find no dirt or fluff. The bed was comfortable with high quality linens. The bathroom was small - but all such hotels had that size bathroom when they were built - but again, it was spotless. Good quality soaps etc. I ate in the Cafe on the 2nd floor - very bright and colorful - for dinner it was empty - but they had a interesting Prix Fixe menu which was very good - the only comment I'd make - is that dessert (which I wouldn't normally eat but was included) selections were all pretty much the same - cake/pudding type of concoctions and the \"yoghurt parfait\" was just a disappointment. Chef--put a sorbet on there or something! The Cafe does a great trade at lunch - and while good, I thought a touch pricey. The 2nd floor also houses the banqueting facilities and did have a slight marie-celeste feel to it. There was something - a store maybe - that used to be there called Truffles? It looked rather sad, like a mall closing down - why not do what department stores do when dressing their windows - put up some kind of screen that says \"pardon our appearance...\" -- or maybe the imminent closure makes it unecessary! When I stayed there years ago - I am sure the lobby had more color to it - some chinese urns or Foo dogs used to be there and reflected the eclectic heritage of 4S? It now is just a plain lobby - could be an apartment building -- which I guess may be next on the cards?

We were greeted immediately when we arrived, they opened the car doors for everyone, took our luggage and showed us where to check in. At the front desk we were greeted by name, even the kids, and wished a happy anniversary. They had a wagon full of goodies for the kids to pick whatever they wanted.....that was a big hit! In our room there was a plate of four gourmet chocolate chip cookies, two glasses of milk on ice (for the kids) and a piece of cake with \"congratulations\" written in chocolate. It was a very nice touch! The bellman immediatetly brought some ice in a stainless steel ice bucket.....that was nice too. So far the service was impeccable! The room was great! We had a separate bedroom with a king size bed and full bathroom. Everything was very clean. The kids could either sleep in the pullout sofa bed or twin beds. We elected the twin beds which were already setup when we arrived. This was nice because then we could still use the sofa without the bed being in the middle of the room. There was another full size bathroom for the kids to use......that came in handy. Our bed was very comfortable......pillow top mattress with a down duvet and down pillows. I'm paranoid about all the bed bug stories you hear in the news so I always check the beds wherever we go......the mattress looked brand new. We also had a great view of downtown Toronto! We had dinner in the hotel restaurant. The food was very good but the service was a bit slow and the waiters were somewhat aloof. Not a big deal but worth mentioning.

I did not pay for the room because the conference organizers provided me with the room as a conference presenter. But when I checked in, it did appear that the conference rate recorded on the check-in document was $150 per night. I received a corner-balcony room on one of the upper floors. It was a very nice room with plenty of space. The fact that it was on a corner (with windows on one wall and a sliding glass door on the other) was a significant bonus for me. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any of the regular rooms, so I have no way of knowing whether they would have similarly impressed me. The hotel mainly services business customers, so it had the same look and feel as most business hotels of that class. The hotel has a very convenient on-line airport check-in kiosk/terminal in the lobby. With a combination of touch-screen and keyboard, along with pre-loaded airline website links, it is very handy and eliminates the need to request the services of the business centre to simply check in for a flight. There were some negative aspects of my stay. None of them are major, but combined they might make me think twice about staying here again. Room service was expensive. The evening I arrived, I ordered a clubhouse sandwich with a dessert and an inexpensive glass of wine. The total cost, which included no discretionary tip, was $67. In addition, the internet access cost $16 per day. There were some elements to the room that were showing its age. The TV was an older style model. The remote control was so worn that the volume control did not work properly (pressing it once would make the volume increase or decrease by five steps instead of one). The bathtub spout streamed water when set to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In addition, I am so accustomed to receiving a newspaper at my door that I found it odd that one was not provided, even given the nominal value of the newspaper. Their staff serviced the room twice on my second day there. Some customers might think of this as a valuable service, but it was completely unnecessary and, because I wasn't expecting it, it seemed a little creepy. I returned to my room that night to find the radio on with classical music playing. It sort of made me want to check the closets, just to be sure. On the other hand, the staff were all extremely friendly and efficient. When checking in, the desk clerk came around the desk to present me with my room card-key (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure why, but it seemed like a nice touch). And on check out, when I asked about storing my bags for the day, the desk clerk came around and took my bags, rather than simply pointing me toward the bell desk, which is what I was expecting. Overall, the complaints are relatively minor. However, they are easier to take at $150 a night (or zero, in my case) compared to the rate I see today on Expedia for the same two days of the week a couple weeks from now ($445 per night!).

I have objected to this in other reviews. I am a good customer of Four Seasons hotels. If you have a vacant upgrade, why not reward your good customers? I guess I don't get it.

We've been staying there for twenty years. The decor of the rooms is so out-dated it's almost back in style, but at least they upgraded the TV's. The rooms are very clean, with two visits per day by housekeeping. I do understand they are reluctant to put any money into refurbishing when the new mammoth Four Seasons is under construction on Bay near Bloor, but the fold out sofa bed in the parlor (Deluxe Executive Suite) is so uncomfortable, sagging, with jagged frame edges poking you in the back, we had to order up a rollaway bed. It's just not possible to sleep on this bed! Even the kids complained. Otherwise, everything was the same as usual. The service was excellent, food was good, but some of the staff seemed a little edgy. My wife had the same feeling, as did another family we chatted with by the pool. Don't know the reason...perhaps a new manager or something. One thing that really ticked me off, which has nothing to do with the Four Seasons, is that Ontario now imposes yet another tax on the traveler which isn't mentioned when you book the room. They have a destination tax, which they call a \"fee\", which in our case was $21.00 per night, x 5 nights. And if you can believe it, they then charge GST on top of the \"fee\". Outrageous! A tax on a tax, and double GST for a room. That, the current exchange rate, and the discontinuing of the tax rebate for visitors makes this an increasingly expensive trip. (Oh yeah...internet is $15 a day). The hotel is worth it, but OUCH! Anyway, the Four Seasons is still the best hotel in Toronto by far.

Lobby Lounge - Afternoon Tea here is the best in Toronto. Amazing service. Lovely elevated area off the main lobby with floor to ceiling windows that sun just flows in through on a nice day.

The University is a block away as well. The concierge staff is incredibly knowledgable and gave us great advice.

The Four Seasons Toronto is an aging 5-star hotel. You can see how it would've been a classic, 5-star hotel in, say, the 80's. But it was desperately in need of updating, when I stayed there. I have a rule I try not to break when it comes to booking a hotel in advance. I won't stay anywhere there is polyester floral bedspreads. And our King Suite ($500/night) had 'em. Luckily, we were staying there with our dog. As such, I bring a sheet to cover the bed, since our large dog likes/needs to sleep in a soft bed. In the pictures, it's easy to see how much nicer the bedroom would look with updated bedding, etc. I will say that the pet policy is two-fold. On the one hand, they do a bang-up job of \"welcoming\" (ahem) pet guests. On the other hand, their pet policy doesn't allow the dog to be left alone in the room. I hope anyone staying at this hotel with a dog is only in town to walk their dogs or sit in their hotel rooms and watch television. Because with no ability to leave the dog at \"home\" alone, you can't: eat in the hotel restaurant, go shopping, take in a film, go to a museum, use the hotel's gym, etc., etc. If you're only at the hotel for a place to sleep for the night, then you might really appreciate the doggie amenities we found. They include: breed-appropriate-sized dog dishes on a mat; bottled water for the dog; two hand towels and a bedspread with your dog's name embroidered on them; some doggie treats; and a dog magazine. Had the hotel had a more reasonable pet policy, I would be glowingly recommending this hotel for pet owners. Alas, I can't...knowing what I know. The place needs to be refurbished with more modern amenities. That said, our King Suite was comfortably sized, and everything worked properly. It did feel a tad dingy, though.

The bed was heavenly, and robes were provided without us having to ask. The room, the bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6even the balcony, everything was extremely clean. Carpet was nice and thick and the hotel seems to have gone through a renovation recently. On our 2nd day, one of the staff noticed we had put some beverages (too large to fit in the minibar) on the balcony to stay cool, and they brought in a small fridge, and moved our beverages into it. Wow, that's service! Truffles Restaurant. Dinner on our first night. I believe this is the only 5 star restaurant in Toronto and it lives up to that rating. Both the service and the food were beyond excellent. When I asked for something not on the menu, it was no problem. When my wife requested a special dessert because of a medical condition, no problem. The staff even mentioned that they'd spoken to the chef about it and the chef had ensured the main course ingredients were tailored slightly to fit her special diet. Room Service. Dinner our 2nd night. and breakfast both mornings. Wow, just as good as the restaurant. Everything was delivered as ordered and everything was fresh and hot. The mutigrain bread may have been the best I've ever had. Ooohhh...the bread. Avenue Restaurant. Had lunch there one day. It was packed but service was still very good. Food was excellent. Workout facility. I think their pool is a tad on the small size, but it is unique. It's open year around and is 20% on the inside, 80% on the outside (you swim under a partition...and the pool is heated). Good size hot tub, and very nice work out room. Juices, water, coffee, tea and fresh fruit are provided free of charge. Front Desk Staff and Valet. Excellent. Valet were always courteous to open the door for us, and our car was brought up without delay (the daily parking charge includes in/out privileges). This is a great hotel in a great location. Right in the heart of Yorkville, with access to many restaurants, shops and cinemas. Sure, you're going to have to splurge but in our case it was worth every penny.

Every question to management was answered with a 'certainly' and a smile. The hotel also has a certain 'celebrity factor' for those celebs shooting film about town. The location is beyond compare with great shopping, parks, and restaurants nearby. However, if you stay, you should be aware that the hotel is rather old and has become dingy. Rather than upgrade this property, Four Seasons is building a new hotel about a block away (ground unbroken). So, you will have to enjoy such things as small tubs, dingy carpet, low ceilings, odd decor and uneven temperatures in suites. The gym and pool remain unupdated in over a decade. Think slab concrete with limited equipment and no views. Also, i would not feel like a spa treatment here as the facility is simply not luxurious. The menu for room service is not bad but it is not spectacular either. We would like to have seen more Canadian items and quicker, faster food delivery. Instead, most meals were luke-warm and lacked variation. However, service was nice. Our checkin was probably the best ever and every problem we had was addressed. For example, a maintenance worker walked in on us changing even though we had a 'do not disturb' sign and had asked him not to. Unfortunately, an internet upgrade in the building was unannounced and much time was spent on fixing it so I could write this review. Management was apologetic and made things right but it should never had 'come to this'. Overall, this is the grand dame hotel of Toronto and the birthplace of the Four Seasons concept (thanks, Izzy Sharpe). However, this Four Seasons is not typical of the overall experience except for the politeness of the staff. We hope to see some major renovations or the new building up very soon. We would also love to see this Four Seasons establish itself as the headquarters for the chain and introduce wonderful new ideas here instead of lagging the entire chain.

They ran to the store for medicines. They allowed us a late check-out so our son could sleep before we left early and did not charge us for the last minute cancellation of our babysitter or the triple confirmed second night of our stay. They treated the children as if they were the most important guests at the hotel and went out of their way to acknowledge them at every opportunity. They had a super reasonably priced kids menu - room service hamburgers which were HUGE were $7 with fries, works and served just as you would expect to be served as an adult- $5 hotdogs, $4 salad/veggie trays - all for kids - french toast etc. in the morning with nothing over $5.

The bed was very comfortable and had an ample number of pillows. The television had about 60 channel selections and looked like it was brand new (other reviews mentioned old televisions). The bathroom was spacious with a large tub and had all the amenities we would need. I have never stayed in a hotel that had such strong water pressure in the bathroom, which was a plus. The turndown service was also appreciated. I very much enjoyed the health spa. It had complimentary robes, free water bottles, free fruits, and was open until 10:00 pm every night. The pool water was very warm and you could swim outdoors or indoors by opening a partition. The whirlpool was great with water that was not too hot and had the strongest jets I have ever experienced in a hot tub. They also had a nice exercise room which I did not use. The room also had a balcony with chairs. Although it was cold, this would have been a really nice place to relax in warmer weather with a nice view of downtown Toronto and the CN Tower. I was very impressed with the friendliness of the hotel staff. They were very polite saying hello whenever they saw me. When I asked George and another male front desk staff member for information about any nearby Chinese food restaurants, they went out of their way to help by giving me very detailed instructions about getting there, calling the restaurant for a reservation, and recommending a certain dish. My wife and I usually go on a lot of vacations every year and we can afford to do sp by not staying in expensive hotels and cutting travel costs as much as possible. We had previously visited Toronto about four years ago and stayed at the Toronto Marriott Eaton Centre and were very impressed with their accommodations.

Its reputation is legendary and it is the flagship of the Four Seasons chain. That said, what's promised and what's delivered are very different. Much is made of the 4S's Yorkville location. Yorkville is not as chic and the sidewalk cafes not as elegant as one would think. The cafes are loud and overpriced. There are a number of trashy nightclubs in the neighbourhood and after hours their customers are up and down the street roaring motorcycle engines and blasting music from SUVs. Hardly conducive to a good night's sleep. On this basis alone I would stay away from the 4 Seasons! The decor is dated, fussy and worn. The trend in hotels these days seems to be towards simplicity and comfort; the 4 Seasons seems to be on a quest to have the largest number of fabrics, finishes and trims in each room possible. Everywhere I looked I saw worn upholstery and chipped paint and trim. The staff seem to think they are GUESTS at a five-star rather than EMPLOYEES. I happen to like to keep a large glass of ice water beside the bed at nightwhile I sleep. I called down to the concierge to ask for a larger glass and the response was, \"You can use the glasses on the vanity.\" Thanks a heap - I know I can use those glasses, but I didn't WANT TO. Because of problems with my company credit card I had occasion to need help from the front desk a number of times, and each time, the same story: people who were more obviously wealthy and had the corresponding enlarged sense of entitlement were allowed to butt into line or simply interrupt a conversation. I was speaking with a front desk agent and a 5th avenue matron type stood right beside me, clacking her nails on the counter. After I had been there several minutes she simply leaned in front of me and asked the girl to call her a taxi! Without a bat of an eye she asked the lady where she was going and so on, at which point the lady next asked for a good hair stylist, then for a copy of the wine list to be sent to her room...and the agent completely forgot about the guest she was already with! Granted the lady's manners were atrocious but the agent should have had better customer service skills than to allow one guest to take over from another. I was walking by again about 30 minutes and overheard this agent COMPLAINING ABOUT A GUEST to another agent, within earshot of anyone approaching the desk. Very classy.

I really think they should take the exorbitant prices and use them to r.e.n.o.v.a.t.e. It doesn't have to turn into some uber-hip dark place to get nicer -- just new bathrooms, new fluffier towels, and some color scheme my great grandmother did not have in her living room. People in town are starting to call this place the Holiday Inn. It's the flagship Four Seasons property and doesn't even come close to their other outposts.", "Date": "May 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWonderful birthday\u201d", "Author": "somebody_else", "ReviewID": "UR4830693", "Content": "We were there for a 70th birthday celebration. Every person we dealt with treated us like royalty, beginning with the doorman, who whisked our luggage into a secure room as we headed inside. \"We have a policy never to leave luggage unattended\", he explained to me. How different from so many other hotels, where you often see piles of luggage in the lobby and outside, with minimal attention paid to them. We were upgraded to a suite, and the check-in agent walked us to the elevator. The room was immaculate and the turn-down service included another cleaning, not just towel-refreshing and bed-straightening. Wow! The bathroom amenities are by L'Occitane de Provence, and small wonderful. Dinner at Truffles was FABULOUS - our waiter was attentive, charming, knowledgeable and yet still gave us lots of privacy. The manager sent champagne to our table, in honour of the birthday. The food was delicious, from the bread at the table, through the complimentary amuse-bouche of duck, through lovely appetizers (including a caesar salad that wasn't on the menu, but they were happy to prepare), through the main courses (especially the chicken served with bacon-wrapped truffles), and let me tell you about the desserts! The Grande Marnier souffles were gorgeous, served with a grande marnier cream sauce. My berries with ice cream (also not on the menu but they were happy to oblige) were perfect and at the peak of freshness. The chef came out to the tables to ask if we had enjoyed our meal and if we had any questions. They also served us a complimentary chocolate birthday cake and complimentary chocolate truffles! This was the most amazing meal any of us had ever eat! en. We were so sorry to leave the hotel. But when we did, the valet brought our car up and had put 2 bottles of water in the cup-holders for us. We are definitely returning!", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Seasons Hotel Toronto", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d155564-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Toronto-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$302 - $542*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">21 Avenue Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">One block north of Bloor St.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M5R 2G1</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "155564", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e3/f5/e3f5946ac4dfc491e500411674c4c8c31large.jpg"}}
