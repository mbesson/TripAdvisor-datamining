The train got cancelled and I found out I wouldn't be leaving until the next morning. It was late at night, and rather then spend the night in the train station, I decided to take my chances at the nearest hotel, The City Centre Motor Hotel. After my harrowing experience there, I wish I had stayed at the train station. Right from the start the hotel had a very sketchy feel to it. There were hardly any lights on in the main office and there was an odd smell in the air. But I kept telling myself that it was better then a night at the station. When I got to my room I immediately showered. I kept trying to look past the mildew built up in the corners of the tub. After that I decided it was time to go to bed. So I lifted up the blankets and came upon a little black bug right in the middle of the bed. I then called down to the front desk and explained what I had found, and requested for my sheets to be changed. The clerk then told me that the sheets \"usually\" got cleaned, and there there \"shouldn't\" be any bugs in the bed. I didn't give up my insistance to get new sheets, and eventually he gave in and told me that since the cleaning staff had left for the night, all he could do was give me a new blanket if I came down and got it myself. I obliged and took the new comforter. It looked as if It was manufactured in the 1980s, it was old and ratty and had holes burned into it. While I was retrieving the new blanket, the clerk kept on trying to convince me there was nothing to worry about, that maybe I didn't really see a bug. I told him I had killed the bug and would gladly bring him down the paper with the bug on it as proof. So I came back and showed him the evidence. All he had to say after that was to tell me if I started to feel things crawling on me in the middle of the night, I would be able to get some more new sheets. What I ended up doing was putting the new burned comforter over top the old sheets, and laying on that to go to sleep. Then on my way out in the morning I noticed there were small bullet shaped indentations on the steel door. I also saw a dark stain in the hallway outside my room. I was just glad to be alive at that point. As a young woman traveling alone I did not feel safe or secure in this hotel, I don't think anyone in the right mind would. The room was appalling and the service I received was terrible. While the price was low, (only $70 for one night) it was not worth it.

We were vacationing from Texas and had just come up from our whale watching trip in Seattle. At about 11:00 p.m., we were just looking for a place to sleep and shower before leaving for breakfast and Grouse Mountain at around 7:00 a.m. The hotel we thought had plenty of rooms had sold out and we did not want to spend $180 plus tax for a sleep and shower hotel. The folks at Best Western reluctantly suggested that the City Centre Hotel was a few blocks down the street, but was for a different clientele than we may be comfortable with. With exhausted kids asleep in the backseat and a beautiful wife desperately needing some rest, we pulled into the hotel, which certainly had the look of a lower end motel. We were okay with that and knew that at this time of the year (late June), even low end motels could charge steep prices. At the window (the lobby was closed), the used car salesman like attendant told us that he had only one room left with two beds, so he would have to charge me $80 intead of $75 for the room. When I told him we had 2 kids, the price went up to $90 plus tax, for a total of $106 Canadian (about $95 U.S.) The attendant would not show me the room saying he was busy. The exhaustion I saw with my family helped me ignore my intuition and we bought the room for the night. To be fair, the air conditioner worked great and the hotel was reasonably quite. Free coffee was offered in the lobby in the morning. The water was still plenty hot after four long showers. The parking was free. The list of negatives, however, far outweighs the positives. The furniture was very worn and outdated. The beds were very thin and uncomfortable and looked like the type of mattresses you could haggle on at the local flea market. The thin and stained bedspreads had cigarette burns in them with one having about a two inch burn hole at the turndown section. The pillows were very flat and small. The 19\" television was a 1980's model and was bolted down. The hotel offered basic cable channels. I was relieved to discover that there was no quarter slots that would make the beds go up and down and that there were no adult products sold in vending machines outside the hotel room. We do not know if we had an icebucket in our room and have no idea where the ice machine was located. My kids were particularly traumatized by looking at the stove in the mini kitchenette and seeing that the drip pans were thoroughly covered in a carbon black, burnt on crud. The kitchen sink had numerous and deep cracks in the enamel. The towels were anything but plush. They were very thin and scrathcy, having a kitchen towel type feel. The bathroom became a rainforest during our showers. No ventilation in the bathroom caused a great deal of condensation on the ceiling which dripped liberally onto the floor. In retrospect, I certainly wish I would have paid the extra $80, even for a very short hotel stay. The dirty, sub-par room was the worst part of our ten day vacation and is a disgrace to the beautiful City of Vancouver. One star is too high a rating for this hotel, which had our kids asking if hotels could be ranked with a negative star rating. We overpaid for this hotel room substantially at $106, but my review would still be the same if we got this room for $40.
