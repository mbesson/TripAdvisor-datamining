Very nice =) Hot tub is great, the greenbelt out in back is a perfect place to walk the dogs so they can do their business and sniff around.

The positives are the modern design, great beds, generously-sized rooms, excellent dual-head shower, and very pleasant service. And, while this place is not cheap, the rates were reasonable for this caliber of hotel, especially for the Napa area which can be outrageously expensive. A few things that could be improved. The room we had overlooked the pool and the folks enjoying the pool were having maybe a little bit too much wine :) and became quite loud as the evening went on. The management said they had strict rules for closing the pool at 11 and they did make efforts to get these folks to leave. But, it took several calls to the front desk to get this to happen and it was getting somewhat late by then. A little more attention to keeping the public areas quiet and pleasant for all -- without guests having to complain -- would be helpful.

Over the past year, we have been fortunate enough to stay at over 25 different Starwood properties. The Westin Verasa Napa is the best Westin Brand Hotel we have experienced and an excellent choice when visiting Napa and Sonoma. Here's why: Location - Last year we opted to stay in San Francisco (St. Regis), drive into Napa/Sonoma for the day, and return to the city for dinner. This was not the best plan as the drive back and forth was very long. The Westin Verasa is perfectly located within walking distance of downtown Napa and some of the best restaurants in northern California. We loved walking to dinner after a long day of driving and wine tasting. The hotel backs up to a peaceful river walk area to unwind at the end of the day. We enjoyed dining at Angele and Cole's Chop House and highly recommend them (both walkable from the hotel). We also recommend dining at The Farm and Boone Fly Cafe, which is a short drive away. If you're in Rutherford, have lunch at Auberge du Soleil for a picture perfect view. Staff - The team of employees complemented each other very well. From the valet to the front desk and restaurant servers, we were always greeted with a happy face and willingness to make our visit the best. Great Property- The hotel is smartly designed. When you arrive you are greeted by the valet which appears to be your only option for parking (the cost is included in your amenity fees). The property configuration can best be described as two connected horse shoes. One side is home to the pool/jacuzzi and the other side is quiet grassy area used for Bocce Ball. The building is three stories and newer construction. Our room included a large balcony, full kitchen, two full bathrooms, tall ceilings, and great living room area. It was lovely, perfect for entertaining, and hosting dinner. We loved our room. Platinum Recognition - As Platinum SPG Members, we have grown accustom to the best that Starwood has to offer. The loyaly program is the best in the business, The Westin Verasa did not disappoint. We were upgraded to a beautiful one bedroom premium suite, provided with a list of discounts/benefits at select restaurants and wineries, given a complimentary half bottle of wine along with a small box of chocolate. We opted for a complimentary continental breakfast (which was served at \"The Bank \",their lobby restaurant) as our platinum amenity. A nice touch included personal hand-written and signed cards from the hotel staff acknowledging our stay. Constructive Feedback: -Gym: Although the gym was clean with newer equipment, it's too small. We found ourselves waiting in line to use the equipment around 8am each morning. It's time to make the space bigger and get more equipment. It's clear your hotel demographic like to exercise. Wineries - While touring Napa we highly recommend stopping at Schramsberg, Chateau Montelena, & Beringer . While touring Sonoma visit Coppola, Lankmark , and Arrowood. Overall, this property was a wonderful choice for our trip to Napa and Sonoma. It is an excellent value and we will definitely return again and again.

The architecture is pleasing to the eye and makes it look modern with a feeling of outdoors. There is a heated salt water pool and jacuzzi that is open year round. In the lounge is a daily demonstration of local vinters displaying their latest vintages. The staff is nice to a fault and were quite cordial. However, i found the service to be very slow. When i requested a rollerbed it took almost 30 minutes for it to arrive. I called from their business center for help with the fax... and after 25 minutes of waiting i left and asked the front desk to fax the document for me. The room itself was very nice and well appointed. The hotel itself is massive and must have had at least 200 rooms. If i stop here i'd give this place 4 stars. They lose a star for slow service. For starwood members: If you are a Platinum Starwood client as I am, you have likely become spoiled with upgrades and other special amenities. However, starwood does teach us to be that way as they continuously flaunt the benefits of being a Platinum member. For those who don't know obtaining platinum requires 25 stays or 50 nights at a starwood property. My big issue here was that this hotel was fairly empty based on comments made from the parking staff and i was not given a \"real\" upgrade even after i asked. I even double checked online to see if better rooms were available, which they all were. Normally, i travel for business and it is not a big deal, but on this occasion it would made a big difference to get a 2 bedroom suite. A \"real\" upgrade is when you get a truly superior room.... Either larger than normal or that features additional amenities. A better view (unless the view is spectacular), or a small balcony does not really qualify in my books. But what really infuriated me was that they attempted to charge me for the upgrade. So they said they could not offer me the upgrade due to availability, but they could upgrade me at the cost of $70... Wow. Starwood hotels in the U.S. and Europe have really been devaluing the benefits of being a starwood platinum member. In Asia you can be sure that you will receive the best room available. In the U.S. you need to twist their arm to get it... It should not be that way.

The next room we went to was unbelievably magnificent. The bed was so comfy we could have spent hours in it. The pool is heated for those that want to take a dip. (Our visit was in December) The staff were super friendly and so understanding when we wanted to change rooms. The bar area has a great vibe. The hotel atmosphere just makes you feel like you want to spend a week there. Unfortunately we did not have time to use all the facilities in the room. It has everything from microwave to stove to coffee machine, and is fully equipped with all necessary cutlery and crockery.

I called to ask for a room change (just for something not right over the entrance), was put on a prolonged hold, then spoke with a front desk person who said she would contact me if another room was available. I called back after approximately one hour of not hearing back, and eventually left the room to go work out. When I returned, there was a message saying that she could not move my room. In my opinion a hotel should go out of its way to accomodate what to me seems like a relatively small request, especially when it is early in the day and obviously the hotel was not yet full.

Note: We stayed one night on a SPG Free night award stay. We think that the overall feel of the hotel is very nice. The staff is very friendly and pleasant. The concierge (2 located on either side of the entrance door) were very helpful. The layout of the hotel reminds us of a resort-style Westin. Each guest is charged an \"Amenity Fee\" of $20 which covers Internet & Valet parking. As a Platinum member the fee is reduced to $10. We were booked for a Deluxe room - yet we were given a very small Traditional Room (which all have connecting doors to the 1-bedroom suites) and informed at check-in that they were sold out and had no Platinum level upgrades available. This happens sometimes so we were OK with this. Soon after we were in our room, we heard what sounded like a big party or reception in the room next to us at 5pm. I went to the front desk to inquire about a move and the agent informed me there was a group next door but that they were sold out. About 30 minutes later it got even louder, and we were concerned that when they returned from dinner it would get even louder. I spoke to a Manager on Duty, Laura, who was very helpful and moved us to another Traditional Room on another floor. We worked out in the fitness center, took a swim in the very nice pool (salt water) and hot tub (which is NOT noisy as was said by a previous reviewer). When we came back from dinner, we sat outside in the lovely courtyard with a glass of wine and enjoyed the fire pit. Around 12:45am, the suite across the hall from us had a party with yelling in the hallway. I called the MOD and she apologized and would send security up. It seems to us that this hotel caters to large groups - primarily during the week. We were surprised to hear, upon moving rooms that the hotel was Sold Out except for the 2 bedroom suites......which they could have moved us to when we had the noise complaints (and due to our Platinum level) but they did not. A nice touch is that every evening there is a Wine tasting in the lobby - on Thursday's there are also chair massages! Overall, a nice resort-style hotel, situated on the banks of the Napa River, which caters primarily to large groups. The staff is very friendly...but take note - the hotel is managed by a 3rd party as a Westin frnachise - so some of the Westin Quality Standards may not be met.

The valet made a disparaging comment to our niece, to the effect, \"are you staying here?\" She told him that she was, and he laughed at her. Please! Could this get any worse? Yes.

Meanwhile, there were at least 4 other guests being checked in, with no problems by another clerk. One of the groups checked into a two bedroom suite...just like the one we had booked. After another trip by our clerk to the back room to talk to a manager, he said that he had our room. Well, not exactly. He found two rooms that were adjoining. I asked him twice .. were we going to get these two rooms for the same price as the two bedroom suite. We were assured that we would. We were disappointed but too tired to put up a fuss. Our room was very nice; big and very nicely decorated (even tho our bathroom door would not close). Our niece was next door and a janitor had to come and unlock the doors so we could have adjoining rooms.

The next morning, we were given a late check-out and enjoyed the tub again, even after we'd checked out, for no additional charge. We were surprised to be the only ones using it.

Wow, what a great place to stay and call home base while touring the Napa area. I would easily recommend this property to friends and family. Check-in / front desk - what a wonderful staff. Every day, regardless of time the front desk was there to help. Check-in was easy, rooms ready upon arrival, and friendly, smiling faces! Room - we stayed in a one bedroom suite. I highly recommend paying the extra and get the extra space in your room. Full kitchen, dining table that seats 6-8, and sofa area that seats 5-6. Bed met the Westin standards and bathroom / shower was awesome. We requested a room off of the pool area and had no issue with excess noise during the day or night. Lobby / lobby bar - great lobby bar that in the evening opens up to the patio and pool area. Ample seating and a very friendly and knowledgeable bar staff to help you pick a great drink after a long day touring local wineries and vineyards. They have a small happy hour for those who are Starwood guests; I enjoyed the hours o'douvres although I noticed after 2-3 days that they didn't have a lot of variety day to day. The hotel also bring in some smaller wineries to showcase their wines with free samples. Lobby bar stays open until 11-12 PM. Restaurant - we only ate at the hotel restaurant twice, but the food was good. I was slightly disappointed in the Sunday brunch. It was not that the food was bad, and in all actuality it was great, but the hotel posts the brunch menu and I for some reason had expectations that there would be a small buffet type of setting where we could try a few of the different menu items...the brunch was more like a set menu to order off of. That said, the food was good. Pool - water was a good temperature given the time of the year and we made use of the pool cabanas which are on a first come, first serve basis...but absolutely great! We spend one afternoon just relaxing in the cabana after 4 days of touring vineyards and wineries. My only complaint was that they always seemed to be low on towels in the afternoon. Great poolside bar and food service from the staff. Thanks guys! Location - perfect location. The hotel is situated about 200 yards from the Oxbow Market, which is great for getting meats, cheeses, breads and other grocery assortments. More on that later. Then to get to the small, downtown Napa area its only about a 8 minute walk. Very convenient for hitting restaurants and wine bars. Very safe walk as well; made many a trip back from downtown to the hotel after midnight. Things to do close by - I would certainly recommend that you get your staples of meats, cheeses, breads and wine at the Oxbow upon arrival. They also have a small organic grocery store in the marketplace. Oxbow is essentially an indoors marketplace of about a dozen niche, boutique restaurants and food merchants. There is a great cheese shop in there, a great place that serves amazing breakfast tacos, and a very cool drip coffee establishment. Loved it. Also close by are other great places downtown. Some of our favorite was Carpe Diem wine bar; we met the owners and want back there every night for a night cap and felt at home. Angele is a great restaurant close to Morimoto's. Loved the food at Angele and their management staff is great (they helped us with a reservation problem and got our large party seated). We ate at Zhu Zhu...great way to feed a dozen of people, and at a reasonable price too. Awesome Sangria at Zhu Zhu. The wine train station is right out the front door of the hotel but we didn't use it so I really can't render my opinion there. :) Kudos - I also have to give kudos to the staff. I sent one of my favorite shirts down to get laundered and was misinformed as to when I'd be getting it back and ended up not having what I wanted to wear for dinner (birthday celebration) due to laundry not being back on time, the hotel staff still had my shirt cleaned while at dinner, ironed, and returned before dinner was over, and they left me a cake and card apologizing for the inconvenience. This was a nice touch.

We like the location because downtown Napa has lots of restaurants and Oxbow but people looking for wine country living might like to stay elsewhere. If you don't need the pool, I think the rooms are comparable to better at Avia, and Avia has friendlier service and is less expensive/better value. If you want more of a resort feel though, come here. But despite the fact that you will pay $400 per night or so at least, with taxes, it doesn't feel like the lap of sophisticated luxury so adjust your expectations. Examples: Some young people were hanging on their balcony overlooking the pool drinking a case of Coors rather loudly (and this is wine country, people). Our room view was fairly awful, overlooking a parking lot where the wine train boards. I do have an issue with Starwood to highlight - the Westin website says rooms are 12-16k starwood points per night.

I am a platinum Starwood member and I had earned a few free resort nights so I booked the room back in June. I had 4 people staying in my room but when I called the Platinum desk I was told that the rooms had a pull out couch and a king size bed so that should be fine. A few days before my check in I emailed the hotel and asked about the likelihood of getting an upgrade. I was told that it could still happen, however, the hotel was very booked. When I arrived at the hotel it was very clear a wedding was happening that weekend and the front desk people seemed very preoccupied with the wedding guests. When I checked in the front desk clerk told me an upgrade was not available but not to worry she would still give me a room with a nice \"view\". I didn't complain since I knew there was a wedding there and I assumed that paying guests go ahead of guests using points for the room. When I got in to the room I was shocked. The room was very small, just a king size bed and no couch. My friends and I again didn't want to complain so we called to see if we could get a roll away bed. We were then told that our room was TOO SMALL for a roll away bed but they could bring us some sheets so we could sleep on the floor. At that point I went downstairs to the front desk to see if they could either give us a different room for that night or the 2nd night we were staying. They said they would try their best. I called again to get more sheets for the 4th person and the person on the other end of the phone said \"oh for the fold out couch?\" *grumble* So my friends slept on the floor of the hotel room. I became even more frustrated when we met a few couples in the elevator who had told us that they had rooms with couches even though it was just the 2 of them. One older couple told us that they were checking out and that maybe we could get their room for the 2nd night. The front desk was no help.

The lobby, the rooms, the back patio/pool area, etc. It is very nice. We enjoyed our stay and had very friendly and helpful staff.

You can get a meal, dessert, cheese, wine, gelato, coffee, etc. There is also a diner and 2 small sandwich shops. Great alternatives if you do not wish to eat at the hotel, which is a little pricey. There is construction next too and across the street from the Westin. There was no major machinery making noise or traffic jams or anything, but it made the area less pretty. The walk to Oxbow Market went past one of the spots and it was just a letdown to pass a construction site, even a small one.

The hotel also houses a very upmarket restaurant (La Toque) which has been rated one Michelin Star. Although La Toque is a superb restaurant, its price is likely to be above many patron's budget and thus hotel patrons will need to find other restaurants for meals. Having said this, the westin is located very close to Napa restaurants (e.g. Main Street) which provide excellent fare. The Westin also has an outdoor heated pool and a decent gym (although a bit under equipped for hardcore gym goers). The hotel charges for amenities. This includes the gym (added to the rate of the room) which I thought was unreasonable in today's age (with a gym being something of a requisite for most people). The amenitie charge includes internet which is great if you are there on business. The staff were courteous and helpful but I felt they were under-trained.

This was perfect! It's less than a half mile walk to all the great little wine bars and restaurants. We came here as the beginning of a trip down the coast of Central Ca.

It is beautiful, the staff is unbelievably friendly, I didn't have one bad meal, and the wine just floooows. :) As far as meals go\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6you MUST eat at La Toque inside the hotel. It has a sommelier that comes around to tables assisting in wine pairings. Try the Ricotta Chick Pea Ravioli. Holy cow, it was delicious. The whole thing was an amazing dining experience!!! The rooms are very spacious. Ours in particular had a pool view with a large balcony, a kitchenette with full dishes and silverware, stainless steel appliances, a large bathroom with a separate bath and shower, a living room with a flat screen TV, and a large bedroom with comfy pillows. It was definitely larger than most one bedroom apts. The bar stays open late, and the bartenders are really friendly. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pretty social people, and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a hard time meeting people to talk with \u00e2\u20ac\u201c patrons or staff. The hotel's outdoor patio is a great place to hang out and eat or drink, and if it gets chilly in the evening, the staff will light the heaters. Behind the patio is a decent sized pool, and there is also a large hot tub. I saw very few children when we were there, so that was kind of nice. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that kids wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a good time also, but in general, the hotel (and city) seems a little more for adults. NOTE: All food and drinks you order already have a 15% gratuity added to it. It does show it on the receipt. Don't forget! We always like to squeeze in a workout, and their workout facility was great. Very clean with lots of cardio machines, free weights, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We wanted to go on a bike ride through the wine valley and stop at some of the wineries. (I highly recommend it, but it can be a little intimidating at times riding on the side of busy roads.) Napa Valley Adventure Tours was basically next door to the hotel, so we walked there, grabbed the rental bikes, helmets, and maps, and rode off. That was really convenient. Of our entire trip, this was absolutely my most favorite stay. I love this hotel, and I loved waking up in the morning, grabbing some coffee from the lobby (bar/restaurant) and taking a walk along the trail with trees and a river directly behind the hotel. Very peaceful, and a nice way to wake up. Sometimes I wonder if the people who give places like this 1 or 2 stars are just mean ol' crabby people who are never satisfied with anything.

At times, the pool was noisy with kids..especially the ones whose parents weren't around! The fitness room was very small...and always crowded--for the size of hotel--it could have been more spacious. The evening wine tasting was just that...a taste---we were offered one tiny pour--that was it!! We did not eat in the restaurant--so I can't comment on that.

The Wine Train is across the street from the hotel--and you can hear the chug-chug in the evening--which can be a little annoying!

We did not cook, but the full size kitchen came in handy when we needed ice or to keep our cheese cold. The common areas look like a lodge and give it a rustic, but high end feel. The pool was great with a mix of cabanas and lounges. I have read it is crowded - we found it only got crowded after 3pm when people were home from their tours etc. But we never could not find a place to lounge. The service was friendly and quick and the valets work hard! With almost everyone driving they have a lot of cars to get in and out of the garage and we never waited longer than 3 minutes.

Upon getting to the Westin, it came as no surprise that they could not find my reservation under my name. They checked the confirmation numbers and found two rooms for the first night. I explained to Sara O. at the front desk I only wanted one room for three nights. She told me it was all fixed and she had put a bunch of notes in the record so that i wouldn't have any problems.

Additionally, the one-bedroom suite was large enough and was great to have the option of cooking simple kids meals. This place is a terrific option for families; we would definitely consider going back. (Even Walmart is a 5-min walk away for anything you may have forgotten, like pool toys.) The pool is on the small side, but adequate. It opens at 8am and you can bet families throw down towels on loungers and in the (free) cabanas (this ain't Vegas people). Seems a little unfair since not everyone spends the whole day at the pool. Still, there is drinks and food service poolside at room service prices. Spotted a few out-of-place couples sans kiddies, felt a little bad for them. But hey, if you're staying here during school holidays, I don't think you can avoid screaming kids poolside. This place is probably nice for couples/singles outside of school breaks. We had a city-view room, which def isn't as nice as the pool/courtyard view.

That's not including the (per night) $55 (city tax) + $20 resort fee. Which, IMHO is way too much for the resort. (Dolphin Bay in Pismo is much nicer for a similar price.)

Check-in was excellent, really warm welcome and friendly staff. Room size and decor were excellent, can't really fault the room at all other than the TVs were a little small for the massive size of the room. Oh and the bathroom door in the master suite afforded little or no privacy, being too small to fit the gap! If you can get a 2 bedroom suite on an upper floor then I would advise that as these larger suites are at the ends of the corridors next to exits towards the public grounds and the river walk. There was some noise from the exit doors banging right next to our room. Not a big issue though and no noise after about 9-10pm. We didn't really mind the $20 amenity fee as it covered the valet parking and Internet use. At every other Starwood property I've visited the Internet costs extra anyway (come on Starwood, it's a basic necessity these days and offered for free by all the lower cost hotels..). We had breakfast the first morning at the hotel and the food was fine if rather basic (the Sonoma Sheraton in Petaluma does much better breakfasts). The service though was quite poor - it took us quite a while to get seated and there was lots of space - the staff were just ignoring us, it seemed like a game of dare for them \"how long do you think we can leave it before they walk?\". Service during the meal was poor also and we had to ask for a coffee fill-up. It was not going to be offered involuntarily. My daughter (like many other kids) has an issue with nitrates/nitrites in foods like sausage and ham. This really shouldn't be an issue at a quality place like this that should source good quality meats free of these additives. We asked whether the sausage included them and the answer from the chef was \"yes\". Not so good - they're sourcing cheaper product and charging high prices. One possible motivation for the poor breakfast service was that 15% service tip is included automatically in the bill - no option. Doesn't exactly motivate the staff to give of their best, and the result is clear. Don't like this automatic 15% addition, it's very poor and I haven't seen it elsewhere. The check had a space for a tip too and it was highlighted with a yellow marker pen as if to draw attention that you should pay it.

Yountville, where all the wonderful restaurants are located, was a 10-15 minute drive away. Word to the wise, there are hardly any taxi cabs in Napa Valley (which we thought was very strange, does everyone just drink and drive?!) so a rental car is a necessity ~ and a designated driver helps, who wants to draw straws?! Otherwise, there are limo services available as well which apparently would cost roughly the same as a taxi if you managed to find one, especially if you are commuting to and from various areas within the valley (eg. Napa, Yountville, St. Helena, etc.) ~ which is inevitable as the wineries are fairly spread out.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kirkand, wa", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to return!\u201d", "Author": "f00die55", "ReviewID": "UR103442625", "Content": "Great service, friendly, no snobs on staff even though the clientele here is upscale.

The hotel itself is very attractive and most of the service personnel were helpful and personable. The only real glitch in my stay was that I used the westin.com website to first book my reservations and then modified the original reservation from 3 rooms to 2 rooms. While I received an email confirmation for the original booking of 3 rooms, I received no such email confirmation (though it was displayed online when I did so) for the modification. Thus, upon arrival I discovered I had been charged for deposits for 3 rooms instead of 2. For whatever reason, the representatives at the hotel seemed very unwilling to offer to return the deposit for the 3rd room despite explaining the situation where i had cancelled the 3rd room in plenty of time to avoid the charge in painful detail several times to each person. It was only after I contacted westin.com itself and found a rep there to printout details for both aspects of the confirmation (which were unavailable to me on their website using any form of identification) as proof, upon which I was refunded that deposit by the hotel representatives. Needless to say, I was less than impressed with the entire fiasco, and it seems to me that there is some lack of sychronization between westin.com and the local hotel systems. At the end of the day, I won't hold the issue against the westin, as it was resolved, but I would strongly advise any parties staying at this location to make sure you have printed copies of any confirmation and especially of any modifications. Back to the hotel itself, its location is nothing to write home about but is easy access to the Silverado Trail and a short 5 minute drive to the 29 for the main winery road. The Westin Verasa had complimentary wine tasting which was nice, and the rooms themselves are spacious and accommodating. The valets were helpful and quick, and checkin was a breeze. In truth, after my ordeal with the deposit, I really wanted to dislike this hotel, but I honestly cannot. I just wish the hotel had given me the benefit of the doubt to begin with. As for surroundings, it is about a 15 minute walk to Bounty Hunter and some fabulous food. From there, I also strongly recommend the Ristorante Allegria (about a stone's throw from Bounty Hunter) for an outstanding dinner at a reasonable price. On a final note, I have also stayed at the Napa River Inn, and in comparison, the Westin is roomier and more elegant, with the River Inn having more of a B&B feel to it with a slightly better location for town.

Had a great stay with impeccible service in what was a much nicer property then I was expecting. I met an old friend of mine there, both of us travelling in from different parts of the world, to catch up, play golf and enjoy the fine food and wine of the Napa Valley. Property & Location: The location is ideal if you want to be downtown Napa. The restaurants of Main Street etc are a pleasant 5-7 min walk away so very accessible. The property itself is quite imposing but has a very 'chalet' feel to it which wouldn't put it out of place in Whistler or similar. The lobby and public areas are all very clean, modern, yet cosy and hosipitable. Facilities: I only really used the Gym once but it was a great size and well equiped. I had it to myself ([possibly due to it being end of week in the winter) There was a pool and jacuzzi which I overheard a few of the other guests saying postive things about. Room/Bathroom: For those who've experienced the Heavenly Beds well there's not much more to say then they are the BEST! This Westin did not disappoint and our room was much more a large serviced apartment then a typical hotel room with a large fully equiped kitchen, two full bedrooms with two bathrooms. Everything was modern and in great shape. We had a nice balcony off the back but since it was pretty chilly didn't get to use it too much. Food & Bev: This is where the Westin really excelled. If you are in the Napa area and looking for fine dining at its best, I would highly recommend booking into 'La Toque' which is the Michelin rated restaurant which now calls the Westin its home. We barely squeezed in on a Saturday night (9:30pm reservation) but what a meal!! The wine pairings are incredible and the food quality and portions were sensational. All the accolades of this place are incredibly well deserved and to be in the same hotel as where you are staying is a massive plus. Summary and Pros/Cons: Overall this property was fantastic and really checked all the boxes. Great service, clean modern and comfortable rooms, great location and fantastic facilities.

Even had an i-pod docking station. One thing that was strange was there were three separate clocks in the room and all three showed different times and none were close to being correct. Did not bother us a bit as we were really casual and not really on a schedule, but we did get a good laugh from it. On Saturday morning we walked over to the farmers market and discovered the Oxbow Public Market. I highly recommend taking some time to visit this. There is a big construction staging area between the hotel and the market so it may see a bit imposing to walk by but it is really worth the trip. Just a really nice unique little spot. Only potential knock on this hotel is that Napa is in the middle of a massive flood zone construction project that is going on right in front of the hotel.

I was reserving 3 rooms with a river view for a 50th Birthday celebration in Napa. I was assured that all would be in order with the best available rooms for each of my guests. I called back about 2 months prior to inform SPG that I was only going to need 2 rooms. At this time I was told there seemed to be something wrong with the reservation and it appeared that I had 3 rooms and they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t delete the 3rd room but not to worry because it was at no cost in the system. When I pressed for more information they put me on hold and spoke to a manager. Upon return they told me they were able to remove the 3rd room and I only had 2 rooms reserved. At that time I confirmed the names of the guests to be added to the rooms just to make things easier with checking in, in case we all arrived at different times. However my husband was paying for both rooms and he held one reservation number. Two days before we left for California, SPG called my husband for his credit card information and he was told that we had 3 rooms reserved. He explained that we did not need the 3rd room and that it had been removed from our reservation some months ago. SPG seemed to be quite confused and called the hotel directly. The hotel didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t show an accurate reservation either, and there was still one room showing at no charge. After several minutes of confusion SPG realized that each of them didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share the same information. Somehow SPG said they fixed the situation and all should be fine when we check in. Upon arrival we were not greeted with a friendly greeting. They couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find our reservation by our last name. They found only half of our reservation by our reservation number which we presented from the confirmation email from SPG. The other half was found under one of our friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last name. At no point we were not recognized or asked if we were GOLD SPG members. The front desk woman was not forthcoming and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer our questions regarding our reservation. She more or less ignored us and then asked to see the ID of our other friend. We presented the ID with no understanding why but then returned it to our friend. Then she presented a card key for my friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room. When we asked about our room she told us there was a problem with the card key machine and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t assign us a room. We asked what should we do and she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. My husband informed her we would be in our friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room and to please call us when she could provide a room key. After 30 or 40 minutes we called down to the front desk and was met with a rude women who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to listen to why we were calling asking if our room was ready yet since we calling from a room. After a difficult conversation we were told a bellman would bring up a key card. And he did come up right away. We asked where our room was and was told it was across the hall. Upon entering th new room it was clear this was not what we reserved and it had not river view. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was worth the effort to change rooms and just moved in. We were never apologized to and no one ever said anything about the mix up upon check in. It appeared that the attitude of the front desk folks was we were inconveniencing them. On our last day we our bill was not in order. Both rooms were not charged to my husband. The other room was showing a balance. We took both bills down upon checking out and was greeted by a very nice women who was able to rectify the situation and was able to charge both rooms to husbands credit card and actually wished a safe and good trip home.

The outdoor area is gorgeous, with a big bowl of gas flames in the courtyard next to the heated swimming pool We went out immediately as we were on a short trip and wanted to see as much as possible. My husband, a regular to Napa for work had ravedabout the beer can chicken at The Bounty Hunter and it did not disappoint. You cannot go to Napa without having this chicken! It has the most amazing skin with an almost dry chilli coated texture and when you slice it, it runs with the most flavoursome juice. After squeezing as much as possible into our afternoon and evening, well out of our time zone and exhausted, The Westin bed lived up to all my memories!

I wonder how many they have in their inventory if any, They finally offered us an upgrade at 5pm the night before we were leaving, but we declined as it wasn't worth the effort to pack and unpack. On the positive side, it is a beautiful resort with a nice pool area with about 10 cabanas. I found the customer service service to be a bit lacking for a Westin property, more akin to a time share feeling. I don't think there is any poolside service, at least I didn't see anyone when I was there. The conceirge was nice but didn't seem all that knowledgable about the area. when we asked for restaurant recommendations we were basically given a printout of restaurants in the area, which wasn't all that helpful. The Owbox market is only a block away with a few good casual restaurants, but be aware that most of them are are not free standing. Better choice for lunch than dinner, unless you wants burgers at Gotts Roadside (try the ahi burger and sweet potato fries). Our best meal was at Mustards Grill in Yountville, great lemon garlic chicken! Overall a nice property that will be even better when the construction surrounding it is finished. Good choice if travelling with family as the suited are spacious and have full kitchens.

When I stopped at the front desk to see if I could have bed linens sent up so we could make up the pull-out couch, they asked if I'd rather have someone come and make-up the bed for me. Of course! They also took care of car services for us when we were going to Yountville for dinner. We had breakfast in the hotel the first morning. Expensive breakfast meat, but I'm totally willing to pay for good bacon! We had made reservations to eat at La Toque and it didn't disappoint! Each of us had the four course dinner with wine pairings. I think the bill came to about $140 per person with gratuity.

I arrived at noon and was told that check-in was at 3 pm, so I left to go to my favorite local shopping destination, Napa Premium Outlets. To get to the Westin, take the Lincoln Ave exit instead of the First St, it's a more direct route. When I returned, the check in was speedy and efficient. I was informed of the $20. per day, resort fee, but not much else. The fee covered the valet parking, business center (one computer with free internet and printer/copier), pool, and Westin WorkOut room. The valet service was excellent and my bags arrive within a few minutes. Ballentine provided great service and showed me how to use the Xbox to watch DVD. The one bedroom unit is huge and has living area (with flat panel TV, Xbox, iPod dock), dining area (seats four), full kitchen with granite counter top, dishwasher, full refrigerator with ice and cold water in the door, electric stove and oven, microwave, toaster, dishes, pots/pans, Starbucks coffee and maker, tea and bottle water. The bedroom has Westin Heavenly bed, flat panel TV, in room safe and two robes. The bathroom is large with separate shower and tub, dual sinks. In room services include, internet for a fee, pay per view movies and spa services can be arranged. The room did not have a view, but a nice balcony. Next time I will ask for a room looking onto the river. The housekeeping did a great job, typically, they put the dishes in the dishwasher and turn it on, but this time, they unload and put dishes back into the cabinets. They were very friendly when I wanted to peek into the other size rooms to see the smaller and bigger units. Also, the turn down service has yummy chocolates on your bed and I was able to get an extra pack of Starbucks coffee! The rooms are very well done and the decor is beautiful and subtle. The restaurants are La Touque (only open for dinner) with chef Ken Frank, who moved his restaurant from Rutherford and his casual Bank Cafe off the lobby (open 7 am - 11 pm). I didn't dine at either, although they both looked very nice. The weather was beautiful and on Monday I spent the day at the pool, with only one or two other people there. I made use of one of the cabanas and was in pure heaven. There is also a whirlpool and plenty of towels. The River Walk is adjacent and there is Boccee Ball court on site too. The meeting rooms are located on the first floor. The only negative I had, was on Sunday at noon, I went to talk to the concierge and was told they would be there in the afternoon. I wanted information on the local area and the coupons that I heard about on TA. There is alot to do, including the Napa Valley Wine Train, which directly across the street and the Oxbow Public Market is at the end of the block and very short walk! There are Bicycle Wine Tours, Hot Air Ballon rides, Kayak Trips, Safari West Wildlife Preserve, Platypus Tours, not to mention the hundreds of wineries in the area. The towns of Yountville, St Helena and Sonoma are a short drive away. Target, Whole Foods and Trader Joe's is at the Trancas St exit. I had a fantastic stay and everyone was very friendly and helpful, which made for a wonderful stay and I enjoyed the one bedroom unit. The hotel manager is Justin Williams and general manager is Don Shindle, I emailed them a Thank You note, but never got a response.

But I will comment on what I did experience. The hotel seems really big once your inside, long hallways of rooms. The room itself was nice, but I feel like it was really plain. I think they could have done a lot more by adding in a little 'wine country' flair. Everything was neutral colors, the room, while big enough, definitely wasn't huge. Flat screen TV, large closet and big bathroom (although not a separate tub and shower and only one sink). The staff was always friendly and the valet was pretty efficient both times we got the car. he was also helpful with directions. My husband and I both will come back to experience this hotel fully, we noticed a huge outdoor pool and large spa, but there was a complaint about the noise coming from the spa late at night. The building is in a U shape with the pool and spa in the middle and even though it didn't sound like the people in the hot tub were speaking to loudly, it carried easily to my window.

The style of the hotel is Craftsman. The entry is spacious but rather plain. There is a bar serving lots of the local wines. There is a very expensive restaurant attached the hotel. We paid for their standard room which was a suite. The King bed was extremely comfortable. There was a sofa bed that was also suprisingly(!) comfortable for a pullout. An LCD TV in both the bedroom and living room. A kitchen with all the utensils and a couple of packets of Starbucks. Spacious bathroom was beautiful with lots of marble, glass and stone. What was unusual about the room was the presence of a stationary bicycle, medicine ball, free weights, exercise ball, and lots of exercising accessories. The staff of the hotel really tried hard to please and one could sense lots of great customer service training. However, the valets (mandatory) doubled as Bell boys and there seemed to be only two per shift. Felt very sorry as they were really running their tails off to please while customers had to wait awhile on their cars. The reader should be aware this this hotel is situated just over a river and adjacent to the town of Napa. It is located on the extreme southern end of the Napa Valley. With a car it is a five minute drive to the beginning of the vineyards. The only reason I mention this is because some of the photos give the impression this might be a hotel in the country overlooking or amongst the vineyards which it is not. If you want that (and I would recommend it) consider Yountville, St. Helena, or Calistoga (note that the distance between Napa on the southern end of the valley and Calistoga on the north end is only about 35 miles on a superb road (not so superb driving if you have tasted too many wines). However, Westin does offer quality at a more affordable price then the boutique Inns and hotels deeper in the valley. Be aware that Westin has jumped on the bandwaggon with so many hotels that advertise one price but have all kinds of added fees. Thanks to Tripadvisor reviewers we knew in advance the real cost so this was not an issue (out nightly rate was $155 + $18.60 Napa tax + $20.00 amenity fee + $2.40 tax on the amenity fee so that is about 26% more than the published price).

A bit lower quality materials compared to other Westins I stayed but fine until they wear out.. The hotel staff is not up to my expectations for a westin. The main issue seems to be managers do not understand yet what a good quality service their customers expect from them. Once the managers understand, they will be able to educate their staff but I do not think that that is happening. Now, staff is saying that they are sorry and that they are a new hotel but you do not see and effort to fix anything you happen to bump into. They have a weird policy valet only parking with a completely empty garage. If you do not want to leave your car to valet, you need to park on the city street where there is no security. But, the garage does not have any security either :-) gates are always open. Some specifics They have heated pool and jacuzzi. They pitched so well that my kid had to have it. So, we went but jacuzzi jets were not working,.Without us calling anybody, somebody came by, then a manager, then the maintenace person. Each of them had almost had the same words: Ohh! You could not work the jets? Let me give try. I told myself that there is no magic in this, you just turn a dial. It is not about me not knowing how to do it, it is just not working. They all came and they all went back. They couldn't/didn't fix it. But, did not come back and say why. My guess that it was not working for whatever reason, they knew that from the begining but did not have the face to tell to us since they are over selling it even while we were checking in. We ordered of the breakfast items two days in a row. Second day, it was fairly bad, no consistency. They have a nice restaurant. I checked out the menu and wanted to have dinner there. I mentioned to the host that my kid would not able to eats and if they can find something simple to eat. The answer was no. I asked if they can bring something from the other restaurant's menu. The answer was an arrogent no. I finally indciated that I want to have dinner there but my kid is paying he bill and need to work it out :-) Then, the host suddenly changed the tone and said they could prepare some pasta or make a meal size outof some smaller plates they have. Too arrogent for a restaurant that has only a few people for thw whole night - hotel was also near empty due to Christmas time. I ended up going to a nice country frensh restaurant in downton napa - Angele and liked it. On the day of check out, we had breakfast and charged to my room. I went to checkout counter and told them that I have an additional breakfast since the last night's bill I gave to them. The person did n even listen and said that I was done. I said I had breakfast that is not on the bill and I would like them to put that on the bill and reprint. She called the restaurant and I could see both of them talking on and waiter saw me waiting. I got the bell boy bring down our belongings with me - which is another 5-10 minutes. My bill still not ready and the girl at hte counter put the blame at the restaurant that they have not put the charge in so I just walked to the restaurant which was a few steps and asked what happened. She started to come up excuses that the others already checked me out so she could not put the meal on, etc., blaming the other staff. I asked her why should I care about these excuses and blames? I asked her to just do it, which surprisingly took less than a minute. The girl at the check out counter said that they are a new hotel and they are sorry. I reminded her that it is not about being a new hotel, and that she did not even listen to what I told her about adding my breakfast to the bill and she ignored my comment my request and said I am done. She just smiled back. There are other less important irritaing things such as hot water taking really long time (>5 minutes), changing channels on TV is full 2 seconds and you cannot zip channels through quickly, missing pillow cover, etc. But the main issue is that managers and staff do not understand they are in service business. Some arrogance which is very unjustified for a Westin motel :-), especially while hotel is practically deserted, and no effort in trying to keep their customer happy. I think somebody miseducated them that they are Westin that they are better than other hotels in the area, that they know it all via good training on what to tell the customer without thinking or listening first... It will take some time for the behaviors to change since most had the same attitude. I was explaining someof my unhappiness to the bell boy while walking out, he was feeling very sorry. He asked for my contact information so that they could follow up and make it up to me. I had to tell him that he knows my room number and the hotel has all the contact information they need (my address, my phone, my cell phone) and I can not figure out why I had to explain these type of things.

Not a major issue, but would have helped to keep our beverages cold, instead of having to make several trips to the ice machine for a cold drink. But still no big deal.

The hotel restaurant inside the lobby, However, is very limited with their choice of foods and not many options are available to people like myself who do not consume red meat, pork or dairy.

We also like the bathroom, very spacious, spa like color and decor, with nice shower heads, and very nice bath products. The color, smell and sense of the room just gave us a very calm, relax and zen feel. We also like the amenities offer by the hotel, the pool and the whirlpool. We didn't have time to use the exercise room, but we passed by it everyday and always saw it very well used by many hotel guests. The exercise room seems quite well equipped. The hotel also provided xbox which my 11 year old son loves it. We wished we have tried the restaurant of the hotel, as we saw it was quite full the 3 nights that we stayed there. But we have to split our 3 nights dinners between San Francisco and Napa and there were so many choices when I researched before the trip, so I completely overlooked the in hotel restaurant.

My experience here was comparatively terrible probably because I had just stayed at some great SPG properties down in southern California (US Grant in San Diego and St. Regis Monarch Beach), but I don't think my expectations were out of line since the regular prices for these properties are comparable. We tried to check in at 3pm (pretty standard), but were told to come back in an hour as the room was still being cleaned. That's fine - we checked out the Oxbow market right down the street and had a great time and ate some really delicious treats. About 4:30, it started drizzling so we walked back to the hotel, the room was still not ready. We sat around for a bit but decided to take another room (not the same room type) since it was raining and we just wanted to settle in. By the time we got to our room it was already after 5pm. The room was nice enough - clean, large, kitchenette, separate bedroom. The two stars are for the room. Sadly, we only had a view of the parking lot of the hotel next door. In the morning, I checked the statement for our stay and it turns out they had charged us ~$90 extra. I called the front desk to settle this. They said it would be taken care of, and would deposit 2000 extra points in my SPG account for all the trouble (late check-in, error with the statement, room type not what I was supposed to get). None of this was done--my credit card statement still showed the extra charge, and my SPG account were not updated with the points. I called two weeks later and they had me leave a voicemail for someone who supposedly takes care of this stuff. I did. A week later, it still wasn't taken care of, and no one had returned my call. On my third try calling the hotel (three weeks later), I finally had someone work through it with me on the phone. The charge has been updated on my credit card, but the points still have not posted. I've wasted more time and energy on this hotel than on any other travel arrangements I've ever made, even internationally. I wasn't able to enjoy my experience during my stay OR even to try to think of any part of it fondly. Though it was just a free night that was used up, I still feel cheated. There's no way I would ever pay regular price for a night here! I might as well try to find a cheap motel to stay in, or stay at River Terrace Inn next doors (free continental breakfast, DVDs to rent out, check-in easy and on-time).

Although the hotel has modern decor, it does not warrant the extremely high price for such an average hotel. The staff doesn't seem to be trained well. Beware that the standard rooms have only one King bed and they don't have rollaway beds, as we were told when we checked in. When we made the reservation over the phone, we told the person that three people would be staying the room and asked for a rollway bed; they said it would be no problem. When we checked in, we had to upgrade to the suite, which has a pull-out couch ($40 more per night). This type of suite was not available, so we had to upgrade to the workout suite ($50 more per night, from base price). The workout suite is nothing special. It has a medicine ball, a stability ball, some resistance bands, and a stationary bike. The resort fee is standard, everyone pays it. Why Westin doesn't roll it into the price, I don't know. It might be because it's already overpriced and if they added $20/night, it would be way too much. To summarize, we ended up paying $70/night more. Internet is included in the $20 fee, so I don't see that as free internet. I was not impressed with the \"Heavenly\" amenities. Yes, the bed was comfortable, but not \"heavenly.\" The amenities and the service were average. There is a river behind the hotel.

While rooms facing the back of the hotel have reasonably attractive views, rooms to the front and sides would look out on concrete, streets, parking lots, etc. - hardly an idyllic getaway.

I am an SPG Platinum member so I was upgraded to a 1-bedroom suite at check in. The room was great (and quite large). Ours had a fully equipped kitchen with toaster, coffee maker, dishwasher, full size fridge, etc. We went out and got our own breakfast foods and made breakfast and coffee everyday (using the hotels complimentary Starbucks packs). This was a great way to start the day. The management was great and saw to our every need. They made arrangements at all the restaurants we went to and did a great job overall. I met the GM in the bar one evening -- and he seemed like a really nice guy and genuinely interested in my wife and I's comfort. I found the facilities to be top notch. The pool and Jacuzzi (open late) were both great with nice little cabanas. The gym is well equipped. The in room (complimentary) wifi seemed to work fine for me. The bar was great. No complaints on facilities. My room had an Xbox 360 in it -- I am not sure if others do -- but if you have kids and you want to keep them entertained, you could bring your games and such. On top of the room rate you do have to pay a daily service charge of $20 or so -- but this covers your valet parking. I bit of a niggle -- so I deducted a star on value. My only gripes would be the lack of an on-site spa (seems criminal to have a hotel like this with no spa in Napa), and perhaps the location (it would be great if this hotel was in Yountville -- a more central location). On the spa side -- they do have arrangements with a local day spa and will even give you lift using their hotel car and driver. There is a great little shopping center and place for food right down the street from the hotel.

I requested a rivew view and top (third) floor room. My checkin experience was probably the worst way to start a vacation.

Watch yall, you gonna get the nasty letter soon because it seem to have been a widespread mistake as the letter was not even personalised. Called Corporate Service at Starwood, which I encourage you to do as it automatically require formal complaint response from the hotel GM.

We are Westin owners and were very excited to visit the new Westin in Napa...until we got there and even after we checked out. We have stayed at many Westin/Starwood properties and never had such a low level of customer service. Sure, the hotel is nice and new, but when you have such horrible service it ruins everything. I was never able to speak to a consierge because I was always told they wouldn't be in until later. The front desk often times did not answer their phone when we called from our room and when we called from outside the hotel. One morning we went to breakfast at The Bank Cafe and it took forever for someone to acknowlege that we were waiting for a table even though they glanced our way several times. After breakfast we went to the very tiny concierge desk (more like a podium) where a gentleman sat. We asked for his assistance and he told us he was just resting there. I then asked if he worked there and he replied \"what do ya need?\" RUDE! Calling for our car was always a nightmare because there doesn't seem to be a dedicated line for valet. When we asked who to call for valet they just told us to call the front desk, but they didn't always answer. The hotel seems to be very understaffed and that may be part of the problem. When we received our bill the day of checkout, there were charges from the prior guest that had our room and for The Bank Cafe. We did not put any charges for dining on our room...they were always paid with cash. After several conversations with the front desk, the bill was corrected. I was told upon check out that I would be contacted by the hotel manager that afternoon and left my contact info. Two days later, I still had not been contacted by the manager. I was also told that I would have part of my starpoints that we used for our stay returned to my account. I called the hotel back and left a voicemail to which the manager finally returned my call. He was very polite and appologized for the unfortunate experience we had. He promised to email me his contact info. After many more phone calls to the hotel I still have no contact info. I have spoken to a couple people at the hotel that promised my starpoints would be taken care of and it never happened.

Not a big deal, but combined with the rest of the problems it was typical of my experience. I paid extra for a one-bedroom suite with a balcony, and the room was great. However, when I went out on the balcony, my view was of two massive air conditioning units that were blowing full blast my whole stay.

The food was great, but they were out of several items on the menu and it took over 10 minutes to get a waiter to come over to our table. One more thing. Room service stops at 11PM.

Our stay was perfect in every way!! The hotel is very new and is a beautiful property located near downtown Napa, along the river(to the back of the property) and across from the wine train station. It was easy to walk down the block to restaurants, The Oxbow Market, and even to the downtown Main St. area where all the restaurants and many wine tasting rooms are. I booked our stay through Hotels.com and got the best value ($189-midweek) for the Deluxe King Room with a kitchenette. The Traditional Room doesn't have the kitchenette. We saw the 1 bedroom with a FULL kitchen and it was very spacious!! Room: We had a pool view room on the 3rd floor. It was very plush, clean, and beautifully decorated in earth tones. The heavenly bed was so comfortable. The room had a small sofa, coffee table, small table with 2 chairs, 4 drawer dresser with flat screen TV (movies were pricey- $15.99), I- Rise clock radio- I-Pod player, in room safe (complimentary use), closet (robes to use). The bathroom had black granite countertops and slate wall in the shower. All the bathroom amenities- hair dryer, hair products, make up mirror, large mirror on the wall. The best feature was the kitchenette. It had a small fridge, 2 burner cooktop, small dishwasher, and the cabinets were stocked with everything to cook with- utensils, toaster, pans, blender etc. There was a one cup drip coffee maker with Starbucks coffee that was complimentary. The fridge had 6 sodas and there were goodies/snacks on the dresser, however, those were all for purchase. The counter tops were also black granite. Pool: The pool area was very nice!! The hot tub was large. There were about 8 cabanas with soft padded loungers and other lounge chairs around with pool towels on each. There was drink service out at the pool. Lobby and Service: The entrance and lobby are beautifully decorated. The restaurant/bar is there and the doors are all glass and open up to the pool area. It makes the lobby open-air style like I've seen in Hawaii. I didn't eat at the restaurant, nor did I eat at La Toque Restaurant that resides at the Westin now. It is one of the finer restaurants in town and very pricey, but highly rated!! You can have 2-5 course dinners there with wine pairings. Outside near the pool were sitting areas with a beautiful water feature/fire pit. The service was great and all staff very accommodating and friendly from everyone we encountered!! Other Amenities: There is a business center with use of the computer internet and copy machine, and also free wireless in the rooms. The small fitness center had free weights and plenty of machines. There is a workout walking path the hotel has established with cards that show you the route. Close by: Soscol is the main street running in front of the hotel. To the right on Soscol you will find Walmart and a Safeway, Ross, Trader Joes etc -turn left on Trencas Ave.-5 minutes by car. To the left on Soscol, there is a Super Target, Dennys, I-Hop, Banks and assorted other stores- 5 minutes by car. Also it is an easy jount up Hwy 29, the main wine road or over to the Silverado Trail. Also golf is nearby at Napa Kennedy Park and not too much further to Chardonnay Club or Eagle Vines Golf Clubs. We were so very pleased with our accommodations and experience that we would stay there again and highly recommend this property!!", "Date": "July 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location, excellent service, wonderful amenities and a good value\u201d", "Author": "karma1007", "ReviewID": "UR35191491", "Content": "I have to express my shock and dismay that travelers are not giving the Westin Napa a five star average across the board. My wife and I do quite a lot of traveling for business and also during our free time as we enjoy adventuring. From start to finish the Westin Napa was very enjoyable. It is an awesome location and super close to all the the city has to offer. You can walk to the Oxbow public market which has everything from a tasty bakery and oyster bar to a kiosk where you can rent bikes and kayaks. Historic downtown Napa with all of it's boutiques, delicious restaurants, bars and shopping is only a few short blocks walking distance from these spectacular digs. The facility itself is organic, modern and classy but very comfortable and in no way pretentious. We did not eat at Ken Frank's world famous La Toque (recently relocated to the hotel) this time around but have in the past. The new La Toque is gorgeous and we would highly recommend it. When the wife and I dined there a year or so ago, we found it to be one of the top culinary experiences of our lifetime and we are quite the foodies. Though we did not swim in the beautiful pool or take a leisurely nap in the resort style cabanas, or play a game of bocce ball, or in anyway take advantage of the many outdoor spaces the Westin has to offer, we were very impressed at the thoughtful layout as we walked the grounds. Our light, bright and spacious studio room was very well appointed. We were on the South (???) side of the hotel closest to the bend in the river and the Ox Bow Public Market. We sipped fresh cups of Starbucks coffee (available in your room) from our balcony on multiple mornings while we soaked up the tranquil river and mountain views. The beds are indeed Heavenly as are the shower heads, plush towels and robes. We had no need for the in room safe, but thought it was a great idea for those that have that need. We loved the large LCD television (super picture) and used the in room X-box to watch a few episodes of Entourage. It was great that the Westin had a fully stocked kitchen (dishwasher, microwave, utensils, plates, stove, fridge, etc.) and we used it to reheat some yummy leftovers and create a few wine oriented appetizers and prepare some fixings for our picnic. The Westin concierge was wonderful and made delightful recommendations for dinner and shared with us some of her favorite wineries and experiences around the area. We felt like she really listened to us and got a good feel for who we are and what we were looking to enjoy, as we thoroughly enjoyed all her suggestions. The other Westin staff team were also equally attentive and knowledgeable about the local area and more importantly the hotel itself. I called the front desk on at least three occasions with questions about the TV, dvd player, room service and check out procedures. Each time I spoke to the front desk they were fast, friendly, polite and I honestly felt trying to make our experience memorable. You will find the Westin Napa Verasa to be gorgeous, convenient, well appointed, wonderfully staffed and a great value for your money.

Insist on a paper copy of your bill and look at every line before you check out! At any rate, it turns out that the hotel is still refusing to refund $390 which was a deposit put down on the initial reservation. A simple explanation and a refund would have sufficed! My travel agent,who tried to reason with the hotel's business manager is also quite perplex at their total disregard for customer satisfaction. I guess their reasoning is that since I'm 3000 miles away- who cares. The whole experience has left me disillusioned with the Westin Napa hotel and with Starwood properties. If I had not happened to check my credit card statement, no one would have notified me of any error! $390 is not a huge deal- it's the principle of being taken advantage of that bugs me.

The Good: Nice, clean, rooms; beautiful lobby; nice bar/restaurant area; good location for the up and coming Napa area. The Bad: Service is sporadic; lots of confusion; differing prices; mis-quotes on prices; very bad chauffeur service; employees not knowledgeable. The Ugly: Price mix ups that took two weeks to resolve. Here's what happened: we checked in, granted, on a busy weekend, but they had our room and booking confused - with people in line behind us becoming increasingly irritated, they asked if we could 'wait' until they checked in the other parties. I told them definitely not - finally, they resolved the mix-up but had the wrong price for the room (I had booked a special on the website for one night for full price, one night half price and they not only had the wrong quote for the first night - twice the booking rate, but the full price the second night). They did resolve this, however. We then went to the room which was beautiful. We went to take the promised \"free\" chauffeured car to dinner and they told us \"it would be better to walk hire a car because there's a 15 minute wait...\" This, after I had confirmed the 'free\" ride when we checked in and they even told us what time to come down. I complained to a manger and voila, a car showed up. Unfortunately, the driver practically begged us for a tip and told us they didn't pay him enough and he had been hired at the last minute just for the weekend because the hotel had booked up at the last minute. Sadly, this entire situation was repeated the second night of our stay - almost identical situation - different driver, same story - except this driver got lost and I had to help him find our restaurant! More: We went to the bar/restaurant and had lunch our first day and it was fine - food was pretty good, no issues. Also had breakfast first morning there. Problem: the hotel charged us for breakfast and it was supposed to be included in the rate! We argued and they gave us the first morning breakfast, but not the second. Then, when we checked out, there was a charge on the bill from the bar that was not ours - it was charged when we were in town having dinner! The hotel said \"we can't do anything - the bar is separate - you'll have to call the manager...\" So, after two weeks of phone tag with the manager and having the restaurant where we dined call him and tell him we were there when the charge was made, they credited our credit card! Final Evaluation: Despite the above, this IS a nice hotel - it was all bearable because the hotel personnel were so polite and nice about each issue. I would go back, but, unfortunately, not at the prices they are now charging. We were given a special rate because the hotel was just opening - prices have doubled - I am not kidding - doubled - since we stayed there. The hotel even called us to say \"hey, did you enjoy your stay and will you come back?\" I told them we would love to but the prices were not justifiable when one can go to the Napa River Inn or River Terrace (just next door, not as plush, but inexpensive!) for half the price. They offered us a \"special\" but it was still $299 a night. This is a nice property, but it is not worth more than $250 a night - and yes, I realize this is the Napa Valley - but the competition is not charging any more than that and the hotel and the location (while a good location - it is across the Napa River) are not worth what they are now charging.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel if you get the right price and the location works...\u201d", "Author": "miaent", "ReviewID": "UR30496245", "Content": "Each room is privately owned and the Westin is the operator of the property and rents out the rooms.

In addition, i have had none of the service issues other reviewers seem to have had. On the first visit when the hotel first opened, there were a couple of small issues with our room but were quickly resolved when i called. The La Toque restaurant was fantastic. Expensive but if you are looking for a top quality experience, go no further. On our first visit, we were placed in a first floor room overlooking the front of the hotel. At first, i was disappointed because i thought i would like a room facing the river. However, we have actually requested this room on return visits. Theses rooms have very high ceilings which give the rooms a more spacious feel. In addition, we dont have to wait for the elevator and are close to the fitness center and the lobby. The room is quiet. I think it is probably quieter than rooms facing the courtyards. The hotel is also within walking distance to the new Ox Bow market which is a great place for gourmet foods and wine. The historic downtown area is also within walking distance.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indiana", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property, but awful service...Westin has really missed the boat!\u201d", "Author": "sara1327", "ReviewID": "UR28437691", "Content": "Prior to going on our recent trip to Napa, I read the reviews on this property and was hoping that the negative reviews were abnormal and more of an isolated event. I couldn't have been more wrong, and the complaints couldn't have been more correct!! The service at this property was AWFUL!!! Let me start with the positive, the property is beautiful, very clean, and in a great location. The beds are so comfortable and the concierge was helpful with restaurant selections. On the flip side, if you want to leave the property, be sure to request your car from valet AT LEAST 30 MINUTES PRIOR....I am not exaggerating. The hotel was no where near capacity and each time we requested our vehicle it took 30 minutes at a minimum. We had to request our vehicle 4 times while the valet guys stood around and chatted with each other looking at us like we were odd for standing outside for so long. Not to mention, you have to pay a $20 per day fee for this valet, which is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. We parked on the street because we had to catch a flight and were concerned we would miss it due to the painfully slow valet. Also, do not plan on eating breakfast at The Bank unless you have a lot of time to waste while you wait for a table with 10 other people and half the restaurant is empty!! Overall, I have stayed at many Westin properties and this by far is the WORST Westin as far as service is concerned. It is really a shame because it is gorgeous and in a great location.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, decor, and food...not enough service\u201d", "Author": "BarryOxford", "ReviewID": "UR28244238", "Content": "This is a beautiful location in an excellent location in Napa. At the south end of the valley, but only minutes to Yountville, Oakville, St. Helena, etc. Located in downtown Napa if you are looking for dining or shopping there. The rooms are lovely. I've stayed there three times and always been upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite with a full kittchen, nice living room and dining room space with either a balcony or nice ground floor outdoor sitting area each time. Nice new stainless steel applicances and nice bathroom(s) with decent sized bathtubs and nice separate showers. The decor is very fitting for Napa, as mentioned by another reviewer with natural colors, and comfortable appointments selected over stylish modernity. The rooms have nice sound systems that work with your ipod and xboxes along with the standard flat screen tv's. The service at the hotel is great and works hard...however, there isn't nearly enough of it!!! The person at the front desk is often trying to manage the valet and the concierge at the same time. I've stayed at westin's less than 1/2 this size (such as Palo Alto, Key West to note 2 recent ones) who had at least twice the service staff despite commanding much lower rack and overall room rates. As a result the staff ends up dropping the ball on requests for service brought to the room, you often wait too long for the valet parking service, and you never find anybody managing the concierge desk. Shame on Westin and the SPG group for mismanaging what is an otherwise excellent property.

We stayed primarily for a romantic weekend night in Napa and the atmosphere and feel of the hotel was very Napa - incorporating natural colors, textures, and wood / stone to the lobby and the room. We stayed in a Deluxe room which to our surprise was a well-stocked kitchenette including stovetop ( 2 \"burners\" I think), microwave, refrigerator, dishwasher, and some kitchen cookware and kitchenware. The bathroom was nicely sized with a dual head shower. And our view of the courtyard was pleasant and quiet. Front staff check-in and checkout was efficient and cheerful. The onsite restaurant, LA TOQUE, is FABULOUS! And hands down the best dining experience and food we have EVER had so it was great that we didn't have to leave the resort to go for dinner. It is pricey, but we thought worth it. Two issues we noted were: 1. We don't think there is much to do in terms of where the hotel is located - I think Oxbow Public Market and the Napa Wine Train Station are close, but I didn't really see much surrounding the hotel itself. 2. The $20 / day resort fee is a nuisance. I don't understand why this continues to be a trend at hotels that are \"resorts.\" It covers valet parking, the use of their exercise facilities (which we didn't check out), and bocce ball. Of the resort fee, we only took advantage of the mandatory valet parking (no self parking).", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cPoorly Managed\u201d", "Author": "carolbeths", "ReviewID": "UR25947916", "Content": "The only reason this gets any stars at all is that after 2 hours, Eugene (the security manager) finally gave us a room that was acceptable...and by acceptable, I mean a room with 2 beds, since that's what we had originally booked. My friends and I came here for my 25th birthday party. Given the current economy and the off-season, we thought we paid enough (over $200) for a standard room with two beds. Upon checking in, we were informed that we had been \"upgraded\" to a room with one king-sized bed--for four adults!--because our original room had been given away. We requested to be booked in our original room, and asked for the Manger on Duty, Antonello, who subsequently refused our request. When we said that we didn't want the upgrade, he became visibly upset and informed us that if we wanted a second bed, we should book a second room at our own expense. He insisted that every single room in the hotel with more than one bed was booked, and that at 97% capacity he could only book us an extra room at our cost. We should also note that the Westin gave away our original room with two beds, and Antonello defended this by saying that the reservation was only made for 2 adults. We had put four adults on the reservation, but even so--we pointed out that there would be several occasions on which two adults would want to sleep separately. Antonello simply responded, \"that would be their problem.\" The manager seemed completely unconcerned that with one bed, two girls would be left to fend for themselves on the couch and the floor, despite the fact that one girl in our party was sick. When we brought this up, Antonello sarcastically suggested that we could book the second room on his credit card. Antonello repeatedly lied to us, saying there was nothing he could do until the Security Manager, upon seeing us make a scene in the main lobby, started to book us a superior room with two beds the instant we described the problem. It took us several hours to get to Eugene, who was the first person to treat us like customers, at which point we FINALLY got a room akin to what we had originally reserved. Given that it was already 11:30 P.M, it was clear the room wouldn't have been sold otherwise. It felt demeaning that we had to make a scene to get a room with two beds as originally ordered. The hospitality industry is one that is sensitive, particularly in this type of economy. It didn't seem like it would even remotely be an issue to be accommodated with a second bed (when a second room was entirely unoccupied) after 11:30 at night. We were astounded that the management argued with us, after giving away our original room, and we were appalled. Despite the quality of the room we were given in the end, we would not stay here again to deal with the hotel staff. Don Shindle, you should be ashamed; with management like this, it's no wonder this was the only hotel with vacancy the weekend of the Napa Marathon.

Staff was so polite, pleasant, and accomdating at all times! They truly went out of their way to say hello & offer to help. We arrived early & were upgraded to 1 bdrm suite.

We ate there on Wed nite which was slower, although everyone else was eating inside, they still offered us dinner on the covered patio and sat us right by the fireplace which they started up just for us along with the heaters. Both the dinner and the atmosphere were absolutely fabulous! A must do even if you stay elsewhere!

We almost struck out on all 3 accounts. The pool was extremely cold and the hot tub was was probably 75-80 degrees at the most. The flat screen television in our room was broken; it kept freezing in mid-program. A maintenance worker came and replaced a computer chip in the tv. We asked him to activate the On Demand system and he instead instructed us on the proper use of the remote control. We asked him to check to make sure it was working. Once he confirmed that there was no On Demand service, he made a call and then informed us that the On Demand system was not working hotel-wide. We returned from dinner, switched on our \"fixed\" tv, and found that it was still not funcional. We were moved to a new room at 8:15PM. En route to the new room, another bell hop asked why we were moving. After we told him the tv didn't work, he said \"That sucks\". We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite. It was a good thing the new room was a suite, because only 1 of the 2 televisions was working. The tv in the bedroom was totally dead... so much for watching tv from the comfort of a Heavenly Bed.

The woman that answered the room service line took the order without hesitation. About 5 minutes later she called our room confused and asked where I had seen mention of the desserts I'd ordered. After correcting my pronunciation of the hotel restaurant, the woman confirmed my order. There were at least 2 other instances of the staff's lack of training. In both of the other cases the staff guessed at the responses to our questions rather than checking with someone to make sure they were correct. This may be pretty typical stuff for a new hotel, but we figured that the Westin would have offered pretty intensive training and brought in some well trained staff from other hotels.
