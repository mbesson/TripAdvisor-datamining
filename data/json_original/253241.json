{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A living nightmare...stay away!!!! This was the dirtiest, most foul-smelling hotel I have seen in my entire life. When we entered, the overpowering smell of air freshener could not quite cover up the smell of stale cigarettes and mold. All of the floors in the hallways were covered with tarps, the elevator was out of order, and the carpets and bedcovers in the 3 rooms we booked were covered with huge stains everywhere. When I went to use the free internet I was told I would have to pay over 30 euro per hour for access. I had to walk to 3 other hotels in the area to find another hotel that did not make my skin crawl. Although we were there a total of 15 minutes before fleeing, the nasty clerk said he was charging my credit card for all 3 rooms for the night whether I liked it or not. We made the mistake of spending our last night near the airport because we had a very early morning flight but we could have stayed in our beautiful hotel in the city center and taken a cab. Never again!! Stay away from this nightmare!!!!", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR563343324", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "nawlinsrocks"}, {"Content": "A very nice stay Well, first of all I needed an Hotel close to the Airport but at the same time not far from the city and this is what I found. An hotel in the city, served by pubblic bus to the centre and at the same time only 5 minutes to the Airport.It was my second stay there, last was last year but I knew the owner is changed. I found it more clean then last year, the reception staff was very nice. Nice the rooms, large enough also the toilette. Peacuful the area. It is not the big important four stars Hotel but a nice family conduction Hotel with all the amenties I expected to find in a 4 stars category property.Nice bar, good breakfast (not vaste choice of fruit or different kind of bread but fresh brioshe, ham, cheese, cereals, yogurt etc), WI FI internet access, lift, safe box in room, frigo bar in room, garage.I recomand this Hotel to business travel and to whom is not looking for an accommodation in the heart of the city but something good for both the city and the Airport.", "Date": "Jan 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR249496017", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Gulliver1Rome"}, {"Content": "Spare Yourself the Disappointment-4 Star NO WAY       Judge for Yourself", "Date": "Nov 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR252394887", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "pss"}, {"Content": "L'accoglienza e la cortesia del...   showReview(20974818, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR884914831", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Ottimo hotel, rapporto qualit\u813f...   showReview(20435989, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR534259213", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'hotel anche se un po' datato...   showReview(20237844, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR188442602", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Tr\u8305s mauvais acceuil.N accepte...   showReview(19997966, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR387690565", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel comodo, pulito e...   showReview(14624146, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR897000190", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel veramente elegante a due...   showReview(13189243, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR250211857", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Hotel de 4 que no pasa de 3   showReview(7346728, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR482065897", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Ant\u8d38n"}, {"Content": "Molto comodo per chi arriva e...   showReview(11361657, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR988352475", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Buon albergo 3 stelle, non di...   showReview(11361658, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 30, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR677197266", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d253241-r21109955-Airport_Hotel-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "253241", "Price": "$115"}}
