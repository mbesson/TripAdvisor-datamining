I stayed here with my girlfriend for the second time and again we absolutely loved our visit. The hotel is charming, the staff (especially Kelly) is one of the most bubbly and wonderful people I have ever met. She gave us some great suggestions and went out of her way to ensure that we were the most comfortable we could be. This hotel has become a traditional stop on our yearly Northern California swing and will continue to be for a long long time. I would suggest each night having warm chocolate chip cookies and wine in the beautiful courtyards hot tub. Totally romantic and delicious.

So here is the \"abbreviated\" version of that review: This is a great little inn if you are visiting Napa Valley and want to save a little money to put toward wine-tasting experiences and meals rather than expensive accommodations. We spent our days out and about, so we didn't want to spend a small fortune on a bed, but we wanted someplace comfortable, clean, and well-maintained. Overall, the Elm House fit the bill. Our room was spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was huge, which was nice but not entirely necessary. The shower was almost too big and didn't have a door, so it was hard to stay warm while showering, which during a rainy February weekend would have been nice. I don't remember our room number, but we had to go out through the very small courtyard past the closed hot tub to get to our ground level room. (I put those details in there because though the courtyard is cute, don't expect something huge, and the hot tub was not open the weekend we were there.) It was nice, quiet, and warm in the room, and there were some comfy chairs to relax in when desired. I love bed and breakfast-type places because I hate having to hunt for a meal first thing in the morning when I travel, but that's just me. The breakfast room is comfortable, but it is not big enough for the guests that come to dine in the morning. We could not figure out an ideal time to go to breakfast because it always seemed busy. Some people had to wait awhile to get an open table. The breakfasts were tasty, and I felt like they had something to suit just about everyone. The staff worked hard overall. As we sat at breakfast each morning, I noticed that several rooms are right off the breakfast area/lobby (it's all one big room really). I made a mental note that should we return to Napa and the Elm House, I need to specifically request NOT to be placed in one of these rooms because I would not like the noise that guests staying in those rooms would no doubt have to hear. It is not located in a particularly scenic part of town, but there is easy access to the main road going through Napa for our wine excursions. (If you're looking for a wine tasting tour company, we used Platypus Tours and loved our guide and the wineries she took us too--we joined one of the winery's wine clubs!) Overall, I have to say that we were pleased with our stay at the Best Western Elm House. We felt that it was a good value for what we got: a nice room, comfortable place to sleep, reasonably good service, and a good breakfast each morning. I think we would very likely stay here again.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery sweet but room could've been better.\u201d", "Author": "Shmaffle", "ReviewID": "UR128636056", "Content": "This B&B is very sweet.

We checked in late, and the hotel was full, so we had a 1st floor room adjacent to a parking lot. We could have changed for our 2nd night, but even this sub-optimal room was still great (quiet, pretty, and steps from breakfast). So, we didn't bother changing rooms. My husband said we shouldn't even mention the less-than-ideal room, because it was still so great, but I am just writing here since next time we know the key -- call the hotel directly (not central reservations) and just request 2nd floor. That's the only thing we'll do differently next time around!", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Plano, Texas", "Title": "\u201cTreated like Royalty!!!!

And, as they said, we found them in our room under a pretty glass holder when we got back - and they were even more delicious than expected (tip: the next night we were around to get them at 6pm, and they were even better warm - make sure you're in)! Our room was out the back of the main building, on the ground floor of a sweet-looking house by the hot tub (a nice addition - we were the only people in it when we took a dip at 8.30pm). It was huge, quiet, had a great (enormous) bed, bath and massive shower - and seperate toilet. There was even a walk-in dressing room with mirror and spare sink. Breakfast also exceeded our expectations - it was in the open area behind reception, and as well as bagels, fruit, yoghurt, cereal, etc, they offer you huge homemade waffles to order.

Although a Best Western Hotel, the more impersonal elements of a chain hotel are not in evidence here. Elm House Inn was clean, bright and cheery. The staff were, without exception, helpful and absolutely charming. We stayed in two different rooms during our visit, both were a little bit pink for my taste, but both were comfortable and clean. Each room had a mini fridge, which is obviously handy during hot spells. We had an ipad with us and used the free WiFi signal with no problems. I would mention, the aircon was a wee bit noisy. Unlike other reviewers we heard no real street noise (except for a motorbike that seemed to go past at the same time every morning whilst we were there) but nobody can really crib at people going off to work for the day. There's a small garden which is very pretty and well tended. A baby squirrel put in an appearance when we were there and caused much hilarity and eeks from some quarters. There was a hot tub in the garden which we didn't use ourselves. The hotel provides a washing machine and dryer for use by the guests. You'll need four quarters for each. You can buy washing powder from reception for a dollar. The delicious Breakfasts made a great start to the day. Everything from bowls of Fruit to Muffins, Bagels and fantastic Waffles with Maple Syrup. We were to sample breakfasts at another Best Western in Carmel a few days later and there couldn't have been a starker difference between the two hotels. But where this hotel really scores top marks is the with it's owners and their staff. Having worked in the hospitality industry myself I know that some guests can be harder work than others and it can sometimes be tricky to keep smiling. But the team at this hotel do exactly that. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble and every member of staff seemed genuinely happy in their work. Father, daughter and staff should be proud of themselves for the level of service they offer at the Elm House Inn. They might consider running a few masterclasses for a few other hoteliers I can think of!! As for Napa itself. Oddly enough we found little to do in Napa. It takes about fifteen to twenty minutes easy walking to get to the centre. We did find the wines far far more expensive than in the UK. The weather was hot, so we actually drank more juice and the odd bottle of beer whilst we were there. If you're on a budget, try Sabor Bistro for supper. It's South American street food. They don't take reservations and you can see why, it was bustling when we went there. You can order a few dishes off the menu and and they will provide you with tasting plates so that you can share. As far as we could see, loads of locals were filling up the tables - and that's always a good recommendation. It's worth investigating the Uptown Theatre in Napa, they do seem to get a really decent variety of performers there. We were miffed to have missed Emmylou Harris who appeared there whilst we were in Napa. We only found out afterwards. Trips out. We visited Calistoga, further up the valley. It seems like a super little town, the locals are lovely and there are some nice shops. There's a super duper clothes shop for we ladies. If you like slightly more unusual clothes that stand out from the crowd (think sixties with a pinch of hippy, and a dash of Glastonbury) then go to Zenobia. Lisa the owner is absolutely charming. We felt like good friends by the time we left the shop. I bought a hat and wished I'd had more money and more room in my suitcase to buy loads of her lovely clothes. Try and visit the Yo El Rey organic coffee shop run by another lovely friendly Calistoga resident. Each cup is lovingly made. It takes a bit of time, but it's worth the wait. If you're of an arty persuasion try http://www.dirosapreserve.org/ We enjoyed one of their regular tours. What an amazing place. You get to visit the galleries and a house crammed full of 2000 pieces by more than 800 artists. The charming and knowledgeable volunteer guides show people around the galleries and then take you up to the main house in a Jinty (a little trailer with seats towed by a four wheel drive).

However, it is about seven blocks from downtown Napa. Overall, the exterior of the building is quite charming. The inside is a little off-not tacky or refined, just...fine. The rooms were comfortable, clean, and big enough, with wifi and flat-screens and excellent air conditioning. Again, not remarkable decor, but not ugly, either. Just...fine. My one caveat is to install an outlet at the \"vanity\"mirror outside the bathroom. Whenever one of us was showering or using the toilet, the other could not plug anything in. Breakfast was delightful; hard-boiled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, fresh waffles, fruit, coffee, orange juice, etc. This and their \"happy hour\" cookies was easily my favorite aspect. The people running the inn are remarkable: this is the inn's real jewel-they are friendly, helpful, remember you and any questions you may have had, and we encountered not a single problem during our stay. Overall, esp. considering the price, I would stay here again if I wanted to have my start/end point be Napa. The locale is excellent and breakfast is marvelous. I think in the future, however, I may choose to stake out Yountville or further, since many of the more desirable wineries tend to be down the road. Again, that's my opinion, and you may entirely disagree with me! I would, however, miss those cookies.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sandiego", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!!\u201d", "Author": "sandieog", "ReviewID": "UR115768952", "Content": "We were visiting Napa for the first time, and we were so pleased with the gracious hotel staff and lovely hotel room.

The room was also noisy due to the hotel's proximity to the street.

Breakfast was good, not great. The only thing cooked to order were waffles. They were good for one breakfast, but by the 2nd/3rd day we wished there was more variety. We have stayed at several other hotels in the Napa/Yountville area and all of them had breakfast (most included) which were far superior to this one. The afternoon baked goods were delicious, but there were hardly enough made for all of the guests to enjoy. The friendliness of the staff was just standard although during breakfast it seemed to pick up a bit. Perhaps we were there on an \"off weekend\", but we definitely won't be going back here.

The decor was a bit on the cold side and the layout a little unusual, but still a perfect spot for a getaway. We had a jacuzzi room, but the jacuzzi was basically a deeper than normal bathtub with feeble jets of water. There was a full size outdoor hot tub, too. On the plus side, our room was in a separate building from the main lobby- we were very glad we didn't get a room with a door that opened into the breakfast area of the main building! Breakfast was simple but a very nice continental buffet with the host offering to prepare a homemade waffle or other item if requested.

The rooms have a sitting area with 2 chairs & little round table, a good size TV, 2 sinks in the bathroom, and a shower with good water flow. Everything is so clean and every detail seems to have been taken care of by the owners, Tom and Connie. There is even a hairdryer, a coffee machine, and some cotton balls & Qtip. Although the jacuzzi outise is small, the surrounding garden is so well manicured, picture perfect, with a soothing water fountain. At 5 p.m., homemade cookies are put out in the \"Family Room\" and they are the BEST cookies I have ever had! Every morning, there is scrumptious breakfast with a homemade muffin. During our stay, we had a lemon poppyseed muffin with a creamy lemon sauce drizzled on top one morning and the next, a banana nut bread with orange zest. Absolutely TO DIE FOR!!!!! Tom is meticulous with his property and is wonderful with dinner and winery suggestions. We had dinner at Neela's one night (BTW a delicious indian restaurant) and Miriam made the reservations for us. One less thing to worry about!

They have really put their heart and soul into it. You even get robes (which you don't in the five star Bellagio in Vegas!). It has free parking outside, very handy. Big room. It's very handy for the wineries, it's pretty much a straight run. It's probably a mile from town so not as convenient as I thought (problem if you both want to drink as you'll have to walk). The road down to the side of the motel is just too pretty for words, it's like a chocolate box scene. It's real 'white picket fence' country, just charming and quaint and gorgeous. I wanted to live in Napa after walking down that road! The staff are very friendly. The owner makes chocolate chip cookies every afternoon, they are the BEST COOKIES I HAVE EVER EATEN. EVER!! They are served with pear cider (warm), it's just delicious and welcoming and sweet. Had waffles for brekkie next day, very nice. There are lots of places in town to get brekkie though and I do love a big American breakfast so I'd recommend going out for breakfast. The vineyards themselves are divine. Go to the visitor centre in Napa town centre, they very kindly give you a list of things you might enjoy, you tick the ones you like, then they tell you which wineries are the best ones to suit your tastes! It's brilliant. We went to Beringer and Silverado, really beautiful. Beringer is old and full of tradition. Silverado looks very contemporary and has a cable car ride up to it. You get divine views over Napa. The tours are fantastic, well thought out, great value for money, fab friendly staff. I want to go back and see lots more. Oh, stay away from the fake castle winery, we drove in and drove straight back out - it looks like cheap tack.

Bed was okay. There were some little things that irritated me...the door to our room opened right into the lobby, which got pretty noisy in the A.M. when breakfast service began; the single sink drained at a snail's pace (surely housekeeping has noticed a need for Drano when cleaning it); the shower is little more than a curtained off area of the bathroom with a drain...there's no lip to it, so water got all over the bathroom floor when we showered; and the lowest setting for our A/C was pretty high and it would not turn on at all in the evenings. I get hot flashes at night, so that made me rather cranky. :/ On the more positive side, the location was nice for exploring wine country. It's about 3/4 of a mile from the downtown Napa area (a pleasant and safe walk with plenty of sidewalks and streetlights). The inn sits on a fairly high-traffic road, but we were not disturbed by vehicular noise as everything slows way down at night. Breakfast was included, which I would classify as a high-end continental breakfast (no protein other than hard-boiled eggs, but the baked goods, waffles, yogurt parfaits and fruit were top-notch).

We checked out of our B&B and did not want our wine purchases to sit in the car all day, so we took a chance that our room at the Elm house would be ready. It was! We checked in about 10:00 am.

(for less than $200 per night, we had a jacuzzi tub and fireplace!) The grounds were beautiful and it was a nice cozy blend of B&B and small boutique inn. Fresh flowers, lit candles and the most decadent chocolate chip cookies were waiting in the evenings. The breakfasts were delicious with a deluxe style continental breakfast, of homemade coffee cakes (Ted, I'll still arm wrestle you for the recipe) fresh fruit, cereal, yogurts, oatmeal, and the most wonderful Belgian waffles. Connie, Ted, and Miriam all treated us like friends, not clients, recommending great restaurants, wineries, etc. You are on a fairly major street and there was a bit of street noise, but nothing that would prevent us from staying again..and again...and again. We went to Yountville shopping, the manager asked us where we were staying....when we said the Best Western Elm House Inn, she replied that it was the best kept secret in Napa.

We found the room we were in luxurious for a Best Western and completely affordable for Napa. The staff were friendly and personable as well as just nice and helpful. That is why I recommended it to my parents for their 40th wedding anniversary this past March (2009). And that is primarily why I am writing. the Elm House Inn surpassed both my and their expectations. I called ahead of time (from my home in Raleigh, NC) to see about leaving a bottle of wine in the room for my parents, and Ted (one of the nicest hotel staff persons I've spoken with at any hotel) was very helpful in helping me pick out the right wine for my parents. He even upgraded their room and told me they'd be well taken care of for their anniversary. And they were. (As you can see, my parents don't write reviews, but for a place this exceptional, their thoughts were worth writing about.) My parents had wonderful experience. They loved the staff, the rooms, and the food. My dad is a huge fan of the mini-loaves and both loved the cookies put out for guests. They found the wine in their room, done up very nicely with two wine glasses for them to share. And the staff played up their anniversary just perfectly, enough to make them feel special and taken care, but not overbearing at all.

I wanted a nice, cozy place to call home for a couple of nights, but we weren't necessarily looking for all of the intimacy of a bed and breakfast.

The Elm House was perfect for us. Many of the amenities and all of the atmosphere of a bed and breakfast, only much more informal ... and with all the amenities you'd expect from a Best Western. The room was spacious and clean, and the morning breakfast was just right. The staff was very polite and accomodating. We met a couple on our wine tour who were staying at La Belle Epoque, so we got to see their room and the house after their guests were treated to a wine social with the proprietors. It was noticeably hot and stuffy in their room ... which was tiny, and all they had was a ceiling fan, plus the house ... did smell like an old house. So, if you're into old houses, close quarters and guest/host interaction ... and some people are, book one of those because they're also rated very highly by the people that enjoy that type of thing.

Living in the San Francisco Bay Area, I get that October is high season in the Napa Valley, but really, we're talking about a Best Western here.

Pillows were flat and in one of the rooms we stayed, the pillow case had make up stains and the comforter was dirty. Breakfast was OK but the seating area is very limited, so on both days people were standing around holding cereal bowls looking for places to sit. They have one table outside, but it was 52 degrees and no space heater. Room amenties are the standard Best Western issue, so bring your own. The hotel is situated on a very busy street, so there is road noise and dependant where your room is located it can be an issue. Aside from the dirty comforter and pillow case, you can overlook the other issues if the price is right, but not for $309.00.

It was very nice and staff were extremely friendly. We also LOVED the cookies that were put out each night, they were delicious.

Since most of the other places in the area were significantly more expensive, I chose the Elm House Inn and booked it over the BW website, using my AAA membership for a discount for a room with two queen beds for myself, my wife and two daughters. The traffic layout for that area of Napa is a bit weird, but after having to make a couple of turns, we got back to the Elm House and checked in. The young man at the desk was very pleasant and helpful. We got a third floor room and found it to be quite clear and well furnished. The only problem we ran into with the room and the Inn as a whole was that it was quite warm. Part of that may be that we'd come from very cool and rainy weather from the Oregon coast through most of the Northern California coast, but we're Northern Floridians and used to heat, so I suspect that the owners may have had the thermostats \"up\" a bit to keep their costs down. The A/C in our room did cool things off a bit, but we found at night (since I was closest to it, I'm the one who had to deal with it!) that it simply would run for a time, then cut off, while the room was stil rather warm. I opened the window, hoping that the cooler air would help, but the traffic noises only managed to keep me awake. Additionally, the comforters on the beds are incredibly thick, adding to the problem. Breakfast in the mornings in the common area on the first floor was very nice and the service was excellent. Yes, they pretty much have the same kind of stuff as a regular BW might have on the road, but it is served and plated much differently. Additionally, the owners fresh bake pasteries and breads and have them on the table, which makes a big difference as well. It was by far the best breakfast experience I've had at a BW or other major chain hotel in quite a while. One review posted recently referred to the rather \"questionable\" nature of the surrounding neighborhood. Well, it isn't exactly downtown Napa or Sonoma, but we never felt threatened, even when I took a wrong turn and found myself in the \"lower rent\" district of town where the folks are the \"help\" in the vineyards, restaurants and shops of the area. Besides, had the Elm House Inn been in a \"better\" neighborhood\" it probably would have been much more expensive. It certainly didn't bother us. It is quite easy to get around from the Elm House Inn to other sights in the area and they are quite good about telling you or even arranging a custom tour for you should you ask to some of the vineyards. My only other complaint about the Elm House was the laundry facilities (such as they are). The sole washing machine and dryer are located outside the Inn through a door to the outside of the Inn that is still covered by a fence. Both machines require ridiculous amounts of change to operate. I though this was a rather tacky addition--though perhaps they do it because of the cost of water in the Napa Valley (I'm trying to be generous). We enjoyed our stay at the Elm House--my two complaints about the temperature and laundry facilities notwithstanding. We got to meet guests from Australia and England because of the breakfast/lobby common area and found everyone to be quite pleasant. We'd have no problem returning there someday.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cNice staff, great breakfast, bad location\u201d", "Author": "MrsClean76", "ReviewID": "UR17164708", "Content": "We stayed here as part of a 20th anniversary trip to San Francisco & Napa Valley. The hotel is nice for a Best Western, but was not the romantic Napa getaway we had hoped for. The place is located on a very busy street, in somewhat of a questionable residential neighborhood. Both mornings we were woken up by a rooster crowing in a house across the street (between 4:30-5:00am!). The deluxe building we were in was better than the main building. I felt sorry for the folks stuck in rooms right next to the breakfast buffet. The deluxe rooms are nicer than your average Best Western, with lots of pillows, pillow top mattress, mini fridge, and one robe. Our internet worked fine. The windows had sheer drapes and window treatments, but no blackout shades. The air conditioner was extremely loud as other reviews noted. The noise from the A/C didn't drown out the street noise or rooster though. The breakfast was excellent, with waffles cooked to order, and staff available to clear tables, bring coffee, etc. In the evening, there were fresh baked cookies, although they were all gone the first night we stayed.

Friendly, personal service at its best. They helped with everything from scheduling cabs to making dinner reservations to recommending wineries to getting driving directions. We were blown away.

First, the positives: CLEAN rooms and bathrooms, BEAUTIFUL atrium with a fireplace where you receive wonderful breakfast foods and coffee all day. The waffles are as good as you hear as are the oatmeal, bagels, juices, teas, cereals, etc., etc. You will be amazed at the breakfast as well as the service. It is like Mom is in the kitchen and she just knows when you are there! Whipped butter and warmed syrup just round out the perfect breakfast! YUM! You almost feel like you are in your home with a butler waiting on you. We had a smaller room in the main building with a queen bed and a corner fireplace. The room was small but just fine for two. The fireplace was gas and didn't offer much heat but did give nice ambience on such a cool and rainy weekend. The bathroom was cramped but offers an additonal mirror and sink just outside in the \"closet\" area and there is a fully stocked refrigerator with water, sodas, beer, etc. for a VERY NOMINAL fee. There is also a basket on the desk with snacks that you can purchase for $1-$2 each. NO PRICE GOUGING HERE!!! CONS: The ONLY major complaint I had was the noise from the street. You could hear the cars driving by and the sirens from police and ambulances that passed by. ALSO, minor disappointment in the fan in our bathroom. It was LOUD and made a very scary noise when first turned on. The water pressure had a lot to be desired as well. Other than that, it was ALL good! ****You might ask to stay away from rooms on the first floor, especially those right next to the breakfast area. CALL AHEAD AND REQUEST that you NOT get rooms on the first floor. One is even crammed in a tiny alcove about two feet from the elevator doors. The front desk was always helpful and because we arrived early they even stored and delivered our luggage to our rooms while we went out wine tasting. I am a travel agent and I have researched and booked many rooms in Napa but this will meet or beat ANY of its competitors on value and cleanliness any day. It is also VERY small so you never fight a crowd for breakfast or service. By the way, the newer building in back is where our friends stayed in the deluxe King and the rooms were HUGE- almost three times the size of ours. We were only about 10 - 15 minutes from the Silverado Trail's first winery and about 20 minutes from those above us on the 29. Since this is right on the 29, it is easy to find your way to either of those. DO NOT bother with the expensive eateries. Stay near the hotel and you will find plenty of offerings!

Tripadvisor is where I begin all of my planning and I haven't been let down yet. Everything that has been raved about this hotel is 100% true - I can't imagine staying anywhere else in Napa. Here it goes...first, the location is perfect. Within walking or short driving distance are spectacular restaurants - whether you are looking for a gourmet Italian restaurant or a great downtown joint to grab a late night dinner. On the coffee table in the quaint lobby is a book that holds all of the menus of some of the best restaurants that Napa has to offer. Seth, one of the front desk clerks/concierge was fabulous - he had a prepared list of recommendations of restaurants and wineries ready for us when we checked in and was so helpful in guiding us in the right direction and making reservations for us. And the room - where do I start? I had originally reserved a romantic queen room with a fireplace and was pleasantly surprised when we had been upgraded to the largest room in the hotel (which, by the way has only 22 rooms). It was a king deluxe room with a fireplace and jacuzzi tub - room 207 (you can view the actual room on the website). To make the room even more perfect, because of the way it was positioned in the inn, there were no rooms on either side of it or below it. Perfect. If you can snag this room, you will be just as pleased as we were. (My only bit of advice is to avoid room 104 simply because it is located right next to the breakfast area and you will undoubtedly hear every clink of every piece of silverware starting at 7:30 in the morning). And, speaking of breakfast, throw in a wonderful (included) breakfast each morning in the beautifully decorated lobby - how can you go wrong?

Yet another factor that made this stay memorable was the friendliness of the man at the front desk, Seth. I'd read about him on here and he truly is as wonderful as they say. Seth was kind enough to put together a folder of the wineries my boyfriend and I should visit and he included complimentary tasting passes, maps and other recommendations. He was extremely helpful, an exceptional employee. To be honest, I was worried about staying at a Best Western, but it was the only location available on such short notice. I am SO glad I decided to trust the reviews on tripadvisor and give the place a try. My boyfriend and I are DEFINITELY returning =)", "Date": "November 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cAs good as they say\u201d", "Author": "hmabramovitz", "ReviewID": "UR4077782", "Content": "I booked because of the great reviews and have to admit that we selected a great place to stay based on the recommendations on Trip Advisor.

We did not use the hot tub, but it looked nice. The hotel was so close to 29, where the action is and it was a convenient drive to everything. We wished we could have stayed longer!

At first glance, we were a little concerned that the smallish building was set very near a major intersection. The main building seems to be an old house that has been completely rehabbed. This is no B&B. It\u2019s better! This is as good as any full service, full hotel size we\u2019ve stayed at. There are about 15 rooms in 2 buildings. As we first entered the building, we were relieved to find a bright well decorated lobby. Our room was average size, with comfortable beds. Everything was new and clean. A good vent fan and air conditioner drowned out most of the traffic noise. The comfortable lobby also doubled as an area for morning breakfast and afternoon wine tasting. The breakfast waffles and assorted fruits and cereals were great. The wine tastings provided were by local vineyards, a different one each afternoon. Cookies, coffee, tea and small sandwiches are available. Turndown service and mints were a nice touch. There\u2019s a small nicely landscaped courtyard in the back, with tables and chairs and a spa. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. An advantage of being near a main road is that we had very easy access to Route 29, the main road into the vineyard area. We were also a few minutes from downtown Napa, about 30 minutes from Sonoma. If you\u2019re not into the B&B or \u201cquaint\u201d Inn scene, this is a great option!", "Date": "August 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, nice rooms, fantastic recommendations from staff\u201d", "Author": "RobLoganPortland", "ReviewID": "UR3790494", "Content": "The Elm House was a revelation, considering it is a Best Western, and considering the price difference in other Napa Valley hotels. This feel much more like a B&B than a hotel, and we found our room to be spacious and comfortable. The only downside of this hotel is that the location is at the intersection of two fairly busy downtown roads. That said, noise was not a great issue. A gentleman by the name of Richard at the front desk was very helpful, and gave my wife and I two recommendations that really helped make our stay in Napa such a delight. First, was Ristorante Allegria, a fantastic Italian restaurant in a refurbished bank building in downtown Napa. Never would have found it on our own, and our canneloni and risotto dishes were spectacular in a great setting. Richard's second recommendation was to use the Napa Winery Shuttle for a tour of Napa Valley. The price was so low compared to some other tours that I was a little leery, but it was an absolutely fantastic day. My wife and I both know quite a bit about wine, but our guide was Norm (also one of the owners) and he showed us an amazing time at a diverse group of wineries. He had an answer for every question, and even made dinner reservations for 6 of us that met aboard the tour. It always means a lot to me when a hotel can be helpful with quality recommendations, and I will remember the Elm House fondly for sending us in the right direction.", "Date": "August 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sonoma County, California", "Title": "\u201cWhat expetert\u201d", "Author": "MellowLake", "ReviewID": "UR3782191", "Content": "WOW!
