I have never been a huge fan of the courtyard brand by Marriott as I am used to staying at the full line Marriotts and JW Marriott hotels but this hotel was nice. The hotel had been recently remodeled so it had a modern feel. The hotel is in old town so the decor is designed to blend into the neighborhood which was kind of charming. Overall this was a great value, I would stay here again. I would not, however pay full price due to the following factors: 1. The bathtub caulking was starting to mold - this is a carnal sin in the hospitality industry. Not good. Otherwise the bathtub was clean so I wish that they had gotten that detail. 2. The mattress was not as comfortable as it should be for a Marriott hotel. 3. The free coffee in the lobby was cold and only decaf was available.

I had stayed at the hotel several times in the past few years and while it had not been updated to the new Marriott Courtyard standards, the property was \"ok\" and the service always excellent. I happened to check on the hotel website a week or so prior to our New Year's Weekend arrival and discovered that the hotel was undergoing a MAJOR renovation. Great for the hotel, bad for me. Had a received advance notice if this via email (they had all my contact information) I would have changed locations. 10 days prior to the stay on a holiday weekend that was no longer an option. Arrived at the hotel to find: Portable bar type unit as a front desk Portable bar as the bar, Temporary tables as the dining area All of this in an semi open type area with strip heaters on the ceiling. Had to walk through the \"real\" lobby that is totally torn up to get to the only working elevator. No temporary covering on the pathway to the elevator so dust everywhere Drywall dust and minor debris scattered in the guest corridor. Arrived at our suite (had been upgraded due to Marriott Rewards status. The room had a strong mold/mildew smell. My wife opened the drapes to see outside and discovered the room darkening shade was covered with mold. This room should not have been in service. They obviously don't actually inspect the rooms for potential health issues. Back to the front desk where we were moved to a standard room (was fine with that) that was newly renovated. Nice room but.. the new toilet leaked at the base and there were two lights in the bathroom that did not work. Not fixed during the two night stay. The stay was on a free night award (not points related). I was not going to complain about the situation but when the hotel pulled 20,000 from my wife's account in addition to using the free night certificate that was already attached to the reservation. Since I had to talk with Marriott to get the points refunded, I made them aware of the lack of notice about the construction and the service failures. In the resulting dialog with the property it became clear that they just don't care about guest satisfaction. Their response was an offhand \"sorry\" They are off my list of properties I stay at in SoCal.

I stayed two weekend nights in June when they were full. They promptly picked me up with their shuttle from the Amtrak station, saving me $15 cab fare. I had called them in the morning to ask them to block a room away from the freeway, after reading other posts about the noise. Certainly, while on the street walking to Old Town, the freeway noise is pervasive, so I appreciate those who posted that. Check in was prompt and the staff were helpful and friendly the entire stay. My room was clean and in good order. The bed had a variety of pillow firmnesses, and was covered in clean sheets with only one of those little footscarfs at the bottom of the bed. This is a Marriott standard, so don't know where the dirty bedspread comment could have come from. The mattress was not worn out. There was a large easy chair and it was in good repair. No stains, no worn out arms, no rips. There were 3 lamps, enuf to light the room. There was a pull out work table, lots of countertop in good repair, and an oversized luggage rack. The room does have the sink outside the bathroom, and this was clean and functional, but to my mind old fashioned, but I know a lot of people prefer that. The bathroom was clean and large. The shower curtain rod needed a screw tightened, and there was mold on the safety handle caulking, but none any where else in the bathroom. Good shower head, adjustable. I reported both those minor items for repair when I checked out. I did not need to adjust the room temperature, so I did not use the wall unit. These are not my favorite, and others had said they weren't fresh. As I had forgotten to pack most of my allergy medication, I didn't want to go there. I had no allergy problems in the room. i do think the hallway and room have that hotel cleaning fluid smell that you find a lot of place. The wallpaper, paint, furniture finishes etc were in good order except where the metal folding closet doors can gore the back of the bathroom door. There were dings there, but understandable. The color scheme will not win any prizes. It's blah. I always consider hotel room rugs to be dirty, and as it so happend, had needed to wash the slipper I take when traveling. As their soles did not get black there, I consider this rug to be less dirty than most. With a navy color, no other way to tell. No stains/spots, well vaccuumed. Staying only 1 night, with plenty of everything, I didn't have the maid come in at all, but as my room was clean, I suspect it's good. Large flatscreen TV with HBO, pretty standard channels. The breakfast was not overly pricey for a hotel breakfast, and as I was here on business, I didn't have time to hunt around for an alternative. Buffet selection was large: eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, all the standard breads, yoghurts, fruits, juices. There was a guy to make you an omelet. The restaurant is dark and not attractively decorated but it was not the end of the world, especially for a quick breakfast. The location was good. It was literally a 2 block walk to the night life, dozens of restaurants and shops of Old Town, plus historic sights. It is 2 miles from USD, which is why I chose it. When my meetings ended early, they ran me to the Amtrak station specially so I could catch an earlier train home. Their regular run was a very close call for this particular train. Again, this saved me money. (They nornally shuttle to the airport and train station every hour on the hour) A friend came back with me for a drink one night, and we sat by the fireplace and chatted til she had to leave for dinner with her family. She found it nice and commented it was much better than where some other colleagues were staying. Cool weather and busy schedule meant no pool time for me, but lots of people were using it. I expect they will do some redecorating and polish this place up, but there is no reason to avoid it.

Hotel is located 2 blocks from the outer edges of Old Town(near the Whaley House). The 2 block walk seemed a bit isolated and since I was a lone female traveler, did not walk over there. Hotel did sell tickets for the trolley tour. They were discounted tickets and I saved $4. Overall, I was extremely happy with hotel. Would definately stay there again.

Rate was $99 - $129 + tax (rate change in the stay) booked off the Marriott web site. Lets get the worries out of the way. This hotel is located next to a busy freeway. They do provide ear plugs - never a good sign. Our rooms were not too bad - on the side of the hotel towards the back the back. There was audible background freeway noise when I didn't have the aircon fan on. When I did the fan hum drowned out the freeway. I didn't have a problem with it and have stayed in a lot nosier hotels. Those with rooms overlooking the freeway may well have caused for complaint - watch your room selection. The rest is positive. The location is excellent a couple of blocks from Old Town and 5 mins walk from the trolley which takes you downtown. $2.50 one way, $5 for a day pass and $12 for a 3 day pass. With downtown hotels costing about double I'd recommend Old Town as a location to stay. Even the cab fare back late at night was only $16. Old Town itself is a pleasant location with plenty of bars, restaurants, etc. Thanks to Trip Advisor I parked on street - thus avoiding the nightly parking charge. However, BE WARNED, if parking on even the slightest down hill slant make sure your steering and therefore wheels are angled to the kerb. I didn't and the result was a $47 parking violation which, more or less, negated the street parking saving. Room was fine (standard Courtyard), free internet worked and they had a couple of internet connected PCs in the lobby which took USB keys with printers attached. Perfect. The exercise room had two joggers, two bikes and a X-trainer and free weights all in good working order. The pool is tiny and there is a nice veranda area. A nice touch is the free wine and cheese most evenings around 5:00pm in the lobby. Didn't eat in the hotel as Old Town is just up the road and has great choices for both breakfast and evening meals. Its a better choice than the Mission Valley hotels due to the proximity of Old Town and the trolley.

The driver was in the lobby loading bags at 4:55am, and we left promptly at 5:00am. I asked for a 4:00am wakeup call, and got the call at exactly 4:00am.

However, street parking is typically not an issue, so I opted to park on the street and never failed to find a spot, regardless of the time of day or night.

However, once inside, it truly does feel and look like the typical Courtyard. This particular neighborhood does seem a bit questionable at night, but I never encountered any problems, but on a few occasions there were older men just roaming around on the streets surrounding the property. Security does seem adequate at the hotel, as there was always a night guard on duty and the doors only accessible with a room key after 10 p.m. Bottom line...I would not hesitate to stay at this property again, but as many others have stressed, please request a room facing away from Interstate 5 -- quite busy and noisy if you are placed in one of those rooms.", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunny California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay...

The hotel served breakfast a la carte and/or all you can eat breakfast for $10-12 depending on your choice. Another positive note, breakfast was good although if your choice is continental breakfast, I think $8.95 is pretty steep since most other hotels provide that free. For the price paid for a three night stay, I could have probably gotten a better room and amenities in other San Diego hotels.

The hotel is crammed onto a small space -- land is at a premium in Old Town. You can park in their garage for $15 or compete for a small number of free spaces in a tiny lot or go for on-street parking. We found it relatively easy to avoid paying for parking and would advise you at least try to do the same. The lobby contains all the tourist maps you could hope for. What''s more. the front desk was most helpful with directions. We did not try the restaurant for breakfast, but it looked like the same sort of buffet spread available in lots of hotels. There is a small pool that did not seem to be heated and a hot tub that comfortably seats 8 or so. And there's nothing lukewarm about the hot tub. Strong jets pushing lots of hot water. The rooms are comfortable, although the layout s somewhat old. We thought the beds felt soft until we actually climbed in. They were fine. The room was very clean.
