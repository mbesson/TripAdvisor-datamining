Their style and vibe does work... The hotel room in New York was huge (especially for NYC standards), but not my favourite. It lacked some old bits and pieces, i.e. the 'vintage balance' that -in my opinion- is key to the 'Soho-style' together with a modern and simplistic touch. Also, you can't open the window, which doesn't particularly improve the air in the room... But the real problem was the noise. Of course the meat packing district is a busy area (especially at night), but you would expect the hotel walls and -windows to be able to at least somehow keep up with it... The bar and restaurant are lovely. Great sense of style and very cosy -together with the fireplace, etc... Food and drinks were good ( but unfortunately overpriced, as the rest...) The rooftop pool of course is also a very welcome bonus. Staff was friendly, but not outstanding ( we had several issues with our TV - no solution, nor apology, and they forgot returning one of our bags which we left in the luggage room on the day of our departure -luckily we noticed only several minutes away from the hotel in the cab on our way to the airport...).

The location is downtown in the meat packing district, don't let the name Soho fool you. Great location near a lot of shops and clubs. We stayed over the weekend of January 13-15th 2012 for two nights. The front desk and butler service personnel were the best part of our trip. The people working at Soho house are fantastic. The rooms are very quirky and different that your typical hotel room. The room is a large open studio. A bathtub is situated in the room next to the bed and the shower and sink are also in plain sight. Don't be bashful with your partner staying with you as there is no room for modesty in this space. The toilet is the only thing located behind a closed door. The amenities in the room that are great include the 'cow' themed products from their spa. There is a wall unit appointed with everything from shampoo to horny cow rubbing oil for your partner's pleasure. The Soho House has a bar and eating area which is an open comfortable space. Appointed with big leather chairs, sofas and tables it has an aesthetic feel between Ralph Lauren and Restoration Hardware. Settle in and a very nice waiter or waitress will attend to your every need from drinks to food. This is a cool space where NYC members come to hang out during the day, meet before dinner and it really gets hopping at night after dinner. The worst part of the Soho House for the type of travelers we are is the noise at night. The area is brimming with partying and the rooms are also full of late night revelry. The room above us was clearly occupied by someone wearing high heeled shoes that could be heard in our room as they walked back and forth in theirs. I will not stay in the Soho house again for future visits, however if I lived in NYC i would join the club.

We realised this at midnight and had to move everything to another room. To their credit, the staff upgraded us to a bigger room as compensation. 2. The area is a full of trashy praty-goers getting drunk and being loud until the early morning hours, which is fine unless you want to sleep, because the windows let in all noise. In addition to this, there seems to be a 24-hour construction right across the road, so there was sound of crashing metal all night.

It really felt like we were New Yorkers in our own Meat packing district loft. This was our second stay in 5 years and in my opinion the hotel has just got better. The experience is a little different than a classic top end hotel service experience, this place is more private club, home from home, you are treated as a club member- I personally love this approach. It felt like we belonged! We were delayed returning home by snow fall and ended up spending many more days than intended in NYC. The staff went out of their way to make us feel at home and keep us occupied at their own cinema, offering to show films we wanted and with in house events. Soho house made sure we had a room at a very busy time of year, even though we were booked to leave days before we did. We even got upgraded to a suite for a while. In the end we ended up staying for Christmas and getting Christmas presents from the staff and for New year, for the Soho House party, which was free to guests and a great bonus. Oh and the Spa is wonderful. the staff are some of the most qualified in the world for massage (NYC requires many years training like a degree). I highly recommend the lovely Helena for a treatment. One thing that took a while to get used to was that the front desk often ask if you are a member and forget you are a guest, due to the sheer amount of comings and goings at reception. We soon got to know all the front desk staff so this wasn't a problem. We also got some great recommendations of places to visit and restaurants reserved for us, including Thomas Kellers Per se.

We wanted some time to chill out but to also have so much to do on the doorstep. Soho House was the perfect choice. It was brilliantly located in Meatpacking District with fantastic restaurants and bars on every corner. We also chose Soho House because the rooms are amongst the largest hotel rooms in New York. I don't think I've ever seen such a well equipped hotel room in my life - our room had everything in it from an umbrella to new underwear! The room is filled with lovely Cow Shed products - so no need to pack bags of shampoo and shower gel. The beds are extremely comfortable and the cleanliness of the room (chamber maid service) was second to none. The staff really made our stay - they are all so friendly and welcoming. The concierge Jonny managed to get us some impossible reservations in the coolest restaurants & 'must see' shows that we had been unable to book ourselves. The only slight issue with Soho House is that everyone wants to get on theroof. But as a guest at the hotel, you can generally get up there first and secure a spot before the masses arrive. Night-time is particularly fun - lying on the loungers with a cocktail in hand on a hot New York evening - a very cool crowd, but also fun and friendly. If you are young at heart, and really want to sample the best of New York - food, nightlife, interesting people - then this hotel is definitely for you.

The rooftop, including the pool (one of the main reasons I went there) was closed, though this had not been flagged on the website. Staff were fine - chirpy and friendly. The room was small and the furnishings old. The eclectic style might have worked when the hotel launched, but it is jarring and faded now. The media system was so complex it needed multiple instruction booklets, which all warned that if you have problems, call a member of staff. In the end, I had to do that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to make the TV work. The place is also noisy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c heard people clearly in the corridor and from a party in a nearby room until very late.

Everyone seemed to work really well together which is why it is well run. Thank you to Jennifer Temen on concierge who looked after us whilst we were here. She really was fantastic from organising tickets to Broadway and also the best restaurants in town. I would definately stay at the hotel again however, the noise was quite bad at times and as a result of 2 nights disturbed sleep (due to the walls being paper thin) , we got moved from a Playroom to a Playhouse which was FANTASTIC and less noisy. The walls in the Playrooms are paper thin so you could hear your neighbour having a conversation plus all the floors are wooden so you hear a lot of noise from above also. The Playhouse was much better and despite the difference in cost, I would definately recommend this room over the others. Its huge!!

The room has everything you need form good stereo, large TV, desk, even a steamer in the shower. The staff were very friendly, but maybe lacking of knowledge as I ask were is the Chelsea market and nobody was really able to understand and in fact it's just after the big apple store, 2 street above. Location is great with a lot of trendy restaurant, bars, boutique and I find meatpacking in the middle of the city convenient. Not far from every interesting place in NY. As we are walking a lot it was a great start for our walk to the north, or the south. The deco at the restaurant and bar is excellent and atmosphere is very cool.

So comfortable that we regretted leaving every time we ventured out. There were lots of other families with young kids staying at the same time which made for a very unstuffy atmosphere. Every member of staff we came across was friendly and charming and (contrary to another review here) did not solicit tips. We also had no problem with noise (but this is a party venue, so we'd brought earplugs as a precaution !) Great location, which we would not have considered if it was not for the hotel, very close to the new Highline Park (www.thehighline.org) which is built on an old elevated railway line.

It's almost as if someone actually put some thought into what is offered! Let me tell you why Soho House is the best place to stay in New York, at least during the Summer when the pool is buzzing: 1. The rooftop pool is a dream in the Summer. There is nothing like having your (free) continental brekky on a sun lounger by the pool at 9am. And, of course, lots of girlies by the pool come the evening .... (And kids in the morning, note, one of whom threw up next to us!). Cute and highly competent wait staff too. 2. Free access to Soho House events during your stay. There was an Independence Day party on the roof on the Saturday we arrived, a 'sundown' party on the Sunday and various screenings in the private cinema. No charge for any of this. 3. They have a pool table, table football table and loads of board games in the bar, which is rarely busy. And free wi-fi everywhere. 4. Fantastic front desk staff who are always happy to chat and book stuff for you (a Soho House concierge also has more clout, I would guess, than a standard hotel concierge). 5. Always taxis parked outside (it is semi-pedestrianised outside the front door so cabs can park up) 6. No attitude. No-one who works here thinks they are better than the customers. If you've ever stayed at any 'design' property where the staff think they are doing you a favour by serving you, you'll find this a breath of fresh air. 7. The meatpacking district is great for shopping, drinking and eating (at least, it is if converted warehouses are your thing) and its walkable to Greenwich Village and the West Village as well 7. The rooms are well designed - have a look at the website photos - although a liking for warehouse living helps! Great rainfall showers with built in steam room in the larger rooms. Even the smallest ones work well, although the bigger ones (mine was 750 sq ft) make the biggest statements. 8. The selection of freebies I have ever seen in a hotel room. Way beyond the usual toothbrush / razor found at a five-star. Also a selection of USEFUL magazines like Time Out and restaurant / bar guides. Some very interesting mini-bar items as well, including silicone lubricant! The price list also mentioned silk bondage ropes but I never found them! It is well worth considering for your next NY trip if you think it is your kind of scene.

The decor is quite masculine, chunky and dark - but there is a huge window and we had a great view. The bed was HUGE and comfy and the \"maxi\" bar had decent bottles of spirits - no icky minature bottles - and a cocktail shaker. The bathtub is shiny and red, and the shower (in a separate room) huge and powerful... and we both enjoyed the selection of Cowshed products and the pullout \"vanity\" drawer with toothpaste etc. - so much more stylish than lining them up on the sink!

The concierge could not have been more helpful - making us dinner and brunch reservations, booking a car from the airport etc. All great recommendations and completed with no fuss. The drawbacks? Arrive late on a Friday (like we did) and you will wait in line to check in amongst the liggers attempting to get into the bar. We tried to have a look at the pool early on Sunday morning and the staff there were surly and rude - and for some bizarre reason barked at me aggressively when I tried to take a photo of the view from the roof!

In short, our stay was incredible. I wanted a special hotel for our visit to New York, as I was planning to propose to my girlfriend whilst away. I contacted a number of hotels, including the Mercer and the Gansevoort, and decide that Soho House was the best option. The reason for this decision was that I not only loved the look of the rooms and location of the hotel but was very impressed by the manner in which the hotel was happy to help me with my plans, so to ensure that my proposal was as special as possible. On the first night we stayed in a Playroom, which was very cool (the photos on the website don't do it justice). On our second day I aranged for my girlfriend to have some spa treatments during the afternoon (including a manicure). Whilst she was in the spa, the hotel staff helped me move our luggae into a Playground room. This room was amazing. It is over 1000 sq ft of urban chic/cool. We (being me and the hugely helpful hotel staff) set the room up with 50+ candles etc and set the scene for my proposal. When my girlfriend had finished having her treatment, Bryony (one of the managers at Soho House, and my partner in crime in arranging the whole set-up) told her that our room had experienced a leak and that we had been moved into another room. She then led her through to the room and from there the proposal went perfectly (she said yes by the way). In addition to all of the above the hotel staff (particularly Michael) were incredible in making all our reservations for us during our stay. Nothing was too much trouble and nothing seemed to be a problem. We have stayed at some remarkable hotels before, particularly Cliveden and Le Manoir in the UK, but this hotel is by far and away our favourite. The rooms, location, bar and spa are special enough, but once you combine that with the service we received you could not ask for more.

If you are reading this and wondering whether u should stay here or not- Please ignore the bad reviews and go for it. It is a great little gem in the city and shouldn't be missed. It is expensive- but worth it. In New York I have stayed at sixty thompson (great location- and Kittichai restaurant is great), The gansevoort (a little tacky -but adequate -It is also almost opposite Soho House) and the Mandarin Oriental (amazing views & service) and have to say Soho House comes out on top in my opinion- for location, comfort, service, & it's quirky yet chic style. It ticks all the boxes. You get a bit of everything- and its packaged beautifully. My sister struggled to tear herself away from Soho House during our stay- it has that effect- its like a home away from home. You're just so comfortable and have everything there. I'm looking forward to using the pool during my next trip.This place is just unique.

First the pros: The location is fabulous! Right in the heart of the Meat Packing district The room was very spacious (we stayed in a \"Playpen Room\" on the 5th floor), a loft-style room with a wonderful lay out and many amenities, including an enormous bathtub in the middle of the room. The Cowshed spa products in the room were great. The shower which doubled as a steam room was large with good water pressure. The club upstairs is what I expected in NYC; very posh, great for socializing and people watching. We actually stopped in there every night of our three night stay. Cons: The bed was so uncomfortable. The staff could not have been more rude. Be sure to not use that wonderful Bose system they provide (noise violation) and especially remember not to wear heals. Of all the places I've ever stayed, I've never been told I couldn't wear heals in my room because the VIP guest below us was complaining. We were told twice (11pm on Thurs and 11pm on Fri) that we were being too loud due to the VIP guest complaints from downstairs and that if we did not correct the problem we would get kicked out. Now, I love to have music playing but think I am very respectful of others and kept the volume to a normal level, so I was shocked when I was told we were being too loud at 11pm. The staff deactivated our room keys after our second night and both my friend and I had to ask to have them activated again. My friend was followed to our room by the staff because they didn't believe she was staying there when she came in one morning. As a member of the Soho house I am sure you are treated like royalty, but as a non-member it's much different. Even though I loved the club, room, and location of the hotel, I would never stay here again due to the lack of service and sub-par treatment of the staff. My husband and I loved the Hotel Gansenvoort across the street.", "Date": "February 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stamford, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cIN the Thick of It here. Our Favorite NYC Hotel By Far.\u201d", "Author": "lmb13", "ReviewID": "UR6179339", "Content": "OK, this is one of THE coolest & BEST hotel clubs ever. The Decor is fabulous. Really comfortable AND trendy w/out being pretentious. My husband & I are members here & every time we come into the city, providing they have rooms, we stay here. We have sampled every room except The Playground (the largest). They were all fantastic & clever w/all the comforts & mod cons you could want (they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve even added ipod docks). My husband & I have stayed in 9 NYC hotels so far: The Ganesvoort, The Maritime, Tribeca Grand, Soho Grand, Chambers, Hudson Hotel, The W Union Sq., New York Palace & Waldorf. We used to live in the city as well & have ate & hung out in many hotels as well. Soho House is by far, our favorite. DO NOT come here if you are looking to rest & relax only. It's pretty much a party hotel. The bar scene is still happening & the Meatpacking District is very hot. New York is noisy PERIOD people!! HELLO?? You cannot control the external goings on of the city!! The rooms....you can hear people turning on the water, or slamming the door....depending on where your room is, you can hear more. Just bring a set of earplugs (if your sensitive) to be safe. Also - never had a problem with bringing in more than the allotted # of guests. Staff have always been really nice & the crowd is cool & minds their own business for the most part (you get a few affected city snobs now & then but who really cares)?! You know why you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care...?? B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122c the place is so great. You can even smoke in the Games room. One of the last places in the city where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allowed. The Pool is TINY (again, city hotel, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect a giant pool) & beware the children! They had to put a new rule into affect with times & how many kids are allowed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite the scene up there so if you get a seat, hold on for dear life but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered after a while. It was too noisy w/the kids. I used to go up on overcast days & relax. One of my favorite things about the hotel is the smell believe it or not! The Spa (Cowshed) makes their own organic products on the farm of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister Hotel Babington House (see below). As guests, they give you the array of products to use during your stay & they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stingy...you get big bottles (however, not to take, b\u00e2\u20ac\u2122c they recycle the bottles) & you know everyone just tries almost everything. Therefore, the yummy smell of all of those ingredients like Lavender, Calendula, Cinnamon, etc... Seems to have permeated the walls of the Hotel. Anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great! If you get a chance to experience it, do so But again NOT if you want a restful hotel. Also - they have a sister club in Somerset, England called Babington House which we've stayed in about a dozen x's. It's fantastic! If you're ever in that area, you should really stay there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern living in the country but it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overwhelm you with how cool it is. You still know you are in the English Countryside AND you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not having to sleep on Chintz or walk around a drafty & damp old Inn.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "FRANCE", "Title": "\u201cexcellent boutique hotel\u201d", "Author": "PIXSQUARED", "ReviewID": "UR5535448", "Content": "My husband and I travel all around the world in the best hotel and I will describe the Soho house as been at the top of the boutique hotel.

All the positive comments here re. style of rooms, quality of food etc are spot on, although I loved exploring NY city, I found myself wanted to make regular stop-offs at the hotel to take advantage of the room and restaurant.

The staff are super friendly and helpful and will try and accommodate you in any way possible. In regards to the roof, it isn't Soho House's fault if a TV program made their space look bigger, that program isn't real life!!
