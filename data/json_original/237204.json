First, it was nice and clean and the staff were friendly. The shower was a typical 3 star Europe hotel shower, it was OK. The room was very small and not much space to move around once you add 2 backpacks to the mix. However, the bed was comfortable and clean. Also, the underground made travelling around easy and quick and the buses were plenty. It was the housekeeping staff that were particularly wonderful. My partner and I washed a select few underclothes in the bathroom sink the night we arrived. It had to be done! We had a large deck and it was very warm, so we layed everything out. We got up early and took off for a full day of exploration in Rome. By days end, the wind picked up and we realized we forgot to collect our clothes off the deck and that they that had probably blown all over, including the court yard below. I was mortified at the thought of my underwear in someones back yard, but that particular housekeeper saved me from embarrassment. We returned to our room and there, all our clothes were neatly folded and laying on our bed.

When arriving at Termini station there is no bus or metro that will take you straight to the hotel. It was about half an hour to 45 minutes away from the touristic center of Rome. The rooms were tiny and the house keeping was not the best that can be, and to me sanitation matters most. Another terrible part was that the breakfast was extremely poor. It was from 7 to 10 AM and the first morning at the hotel we went down to eat at 8:30 AM and there was nothing there. The staff was not a nice as can be either. They were rude and seemed like they did not enjoy having their guests stay there. The hotel is mostly used by big tours from other countries, especially with teenagers which tend to be loud and inconsiderate. One night the smoke alarms woke us all up at midnight because somebody was smoking in one of the rooms. Also it seemed like the walls were made out of paper because we could hear what the other guests were doing. This startled many of us. I definitely do not recommend this hotel to anybody.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laguna Niguel, California", "Title": "\u201cFar from Center, unhelpfull indifferrent stuff\u201d", "Author": "Matiola", "ReviewID": "UR23756418", "Content": "Two of us stayed 4 nights in this hotel in December 2008, right before New Year.Hotel is located pretty far from center, in unglamorous working neighborhood.

The room was nice with a large bathroom and a nice large window which could be opened to the street. There wasn't much noise either. For those depending on the breakfast I would say make sure you pack some extra snacks. The breakfast is not very fulfilling but I guess it works for young adults who just don't care!!! There is also a bus stop which is located right outside of the hotel gates which allows for easy transportation to all of the major sites in Rome!!!
