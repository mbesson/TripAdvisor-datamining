We spent 4 nights, in a room like the new one that the pics show. I think that the other pics are before the remodeling (hotel told us they did it late 2011), because the full hotel looked new (I don't think they left rooms without remodeling...). It was probably the cheapest double room (we got a very good deal for the whole Rome, imagine on that area...), not big (~20sqm) but modern, with LCD TV, small fridge (just part of the minibar), a small table and closet with safe. Good bed too. It had a window facing the street, with typical/nice view of Rome streets, quite well isolated for noise (not perfect) but during the night it was quiet (no traffic). We didn't hear either the other rooms. The restroom was also small but had a shower, toilet, bidet, sink... All very clean. Breakfast was on the top terrace (read nice view). Good, of continental kind... Cereal, yoghourt, tasty pastry, breads... and the lady there is probably the most dedicated waitress I've seen. The staff in general was very attentive. Only con is that the WiFi in our room was pretty bad/can't use, but actually I think it is only advertised in the reception, so...

The rooms are very basic but anyone who stays in the room and doesn't get out into the city should not stay in a hotel like this one. The breakfast in the mornings was served upstairs on the terrace and it was wonderful. All beverages (coffee tea, hot chocolate) were served with steamed milk (if requested) and that makes such a difference. We also used the terrace in the evenings to have some wine and talk with other guests. Wifi worked well with our iPhone but only on the main floor where reception was. This is not a place to stay if you are infirm, the hotel reception is on the 2nd floor and our room was on the 5th. There's an elevator but it is tiny and can barely fit 2 people with carry on bags. We only used it twice, while moving in and out of the hotel. The stairs don't have handrails and might pose a problem for someone who suffers from positional vertigo or who gets dizzy going down a winding road. Our first night we ate at a hotel recommended restaurant and it was decent but we got the feeling that had we not been so hungry, we could have chosen something better on our own. The location was fantastic. We could see the church at the top of the Spanish Steps from our windows. If you are a light sleeper, keep in mind all the rooms surround the central staircase and the lift runs up and down the center of the stairs. We were one floor below the breakfast terrace so we could hear people coming up to eat and the milk being steamed. Rather than it bothering us, we found it charming and it was an incentive to get up and eat before adventuring out. We were able to use the computer (a Mac) provided for guests to check in for our connecting flight and look up restaurants, but describing it was a \"business center\" would be a stretch. We would return, the staff were lovely and it was a good base for getting to most of the sights.

The elevator/lift was not working properly our entire stay, but we were getting used to the walking and steps that come with Rome. The air conditioner was controlled by management at the front desk. They would turn it off as you left the hotel and we would get back to a hot and steamy room.

Booked through hotels own internet where we got offer of E493 instead of E600, and tripadvisors reports were all very good. Location wise it is excellent - half way between Trevi Fountain & Spanish Steps, and just a stroll to good shops, restaurants and bars. The hotel is basically a narrow terrace building. Access to reception is up narrow winding marble stairs, and there you might have the pleasure of meeting 'the director' who has very little English. I though he was showing us to our room but instead he showed us the lift - as there was no way that any more than 2 people could have got into it. (or anyone bigger than normal size). You step into this 'box' close the outer metal gates and inner glass doors and then you ascend up a chute, seeing every floor on the way. Our room was at the very top of the house (probably because I asked for a room with a view - which it had of rooftops and a nice domed roof- and we had to walk the last small flight of stairs as the lift didnt go the whole way. Our room was straight opposite the roof top terrace where breakfast is served each morning, so everyone else had to take the lift up each morning. Therefore the noise of the lift starts before 7.00am each morning, so dont expect to be able to have a lie in. The roof top terrace is quite nice and must be really lovely when the weather would be a bit warmer. We had beautiful weather but early morning and evening was very cool, so you had to wrap up well for breakfast. This would have been fine if you were tucking into a big Irish or English fry, but breakfast consisted of juice, croissants, crusty roll, butter, jam or spreadable cheese, and yoghurts , tea,coffee or hot chocolate,which I thought was very meagre for the price of the hotel. I dont think that cereal /fruit and nuts would have broken the bank but it would have made it seem a bit better value.The rooms were very simple - I felt I had gone back in time 30 years. You certainly wont be stocking up on the toiletries as one usually does after an hotel stay - it was all little plastic sachets . however - the staff were very nice, the place was very clean, the bedlinen was crisp and fresh, there was a computer room with free access to internet which was very handy. Location was excellent. I liked to go to the terrace to read a book in the sunshine after all the walking about - (unfortunately I only discovered the deckchair tucked away at the stairs the day I left). I read another reviewer say that they brought back wine and snacks to eat on the terrace before they went out in the evening and I can see how this would be a good idea in the warmer weather. We found our room cold but that was probably because it was directly opposite the rooftop terrace and once the sun went down it was very cool but then it was October after all - I am sure the opposite is the case in the summer). We mentioned that it was cold at reception and the boy on reception explained that the director thought it was too soon to turn on the heating, but he did leave us in an oil filled electric heater which did the trick. I rely so much on tripadvisor for reviews before I visit or book anywhere and I therefore always leave a review of where I have been. I have had to think long and hard about my rating for this hotel as I would score it highly on location, cleanliness, service. I suppose I feel that for the price it was very basic and simple - however in saying that I had searched the internet for days and wasnt coming up with anything which sounded much better value. There is a very nice italian deli/restaurant just three doors up on the left - cannot remember the name = something like Os entorio - but you will see the newspaper clippings and reviews in the window and inside. They speak very little english but the food is good as it is packed with local people. We also called in for just a night cap, as the hotel has no bar. We found another very nice modern but comfortable restaurant /pizzeria/wine bar called 'Life'- address is 28/30 Via della Vite - good food and good value. Also ate in La Scaletta Via S.maria dell'Anima near Plaza Navonna which again was reasonably priced. Remember to visit Romes oldest cafe Caffe Greco on the Via Condotti facing the Spanish Steps. Whatever you do dont sit down, just order your coffee at the till and stand and drink it at the counter opposite - it is really lovely and inexpensive. If you are near the Colloseum there is a busy italien restaurant called Le Naumachie, on Via Dei Santi Quattro - it is really busy with locals so it must be good. We visited the Colloseum but we thought it was as impressive outside as it is inside so unless you really really want to go in, I would save the 14 euro entrance fee and buy a calendar with lovely pictures. On the other hand, The basilica, the vatican & museums (dont miss the tapestry 'the ressurection of Christ' where both the tomb stone and the Christ's eyes follow you as you pass by - a real optical illusion!), pantheon, spanish steps, trevi fountain, the building at piazza venetio is really worth seeing. In summary, we had a great time - the only thing that is making us score this hotel 3 is that we just felt it was a bit pricey for its simplicity and the breakfast, but other than that I would be happy to recommend it.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensboro", "Title": "\u201cCharm and Location\u201d", "Author": "TwoTravelingTarHeels", "ReviewID": "UR45914852", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights before our cruise and one night afterwards.

Breakfast itself was simple with croissants, breads and yogurt. I would have liked some fruit. The coffee was excellent. In the afternoon we bought food at a nearby grocery store and had wine and hors d\u2019oeuvres on the terrace before dinner. That was a fantastic plus for this hotel. You do have to walk up one flight of stairs to get to the reception area, but the owner offered to carry my suitcase. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. The elevator is small and can hold three people or one person with two suitcases. The location cannot be beat. As everyone else has said, the Spanish steps are literally around the corner and the Trevi Fountain a couple of blocks further.

Our choice was based on positive reviews on this site plus its good location. In the event, we were delighted with our experience. The rooms were clean with good facilities and breakfast on the roof top was an absolute delight (although confined to continental type consisting of rolls, jam and yoghurt). The hotel decor was charmingly quirky, with paintings on each floor and a cute old elevator. This was exactly what I imagined a family run hotel in Rome should be like! The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location was very central, a few minutes walk to the Spanish Steps and Spagna Metro as well as a few minutes walk to the Trevi Fountain. I would certainly stay there again. The only caution I can advise is that due to the long staircase from the street to reception, this hotel might not suit people who have difficulty with stairs.", "Date": "October 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cOkay... but lacking something\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4601275", "Content": "On the upside \u2013 it's 5 minutes from the Spanish steps and surrounding shops, 10-15 minutes from the Pantheon and Trevi fountain and is probably a bit cheaper than other hotels in the area. The breakfast was fine, served on the top floor terrace and the woman we had most interaction with was friendly and helpful, able to sort out football tickets and other queries. On the downside, other staff were wearily unsmiling and the general atmosphere was a bit on the dreary side; the room was 'clean'; and spacious, but a smell of stale pipe smoke and cleaning products wasn't the ideal fragrance for a three day stay; the bath was only marginally bigger than a basin; and while getting up early in Rome is probably a good idea anyway, hearing staff crashing around moving furniture at 7 in the morning made it pretty much compulsory on one day. Probably fine for a short trip when you're out most of the time anyway but if you're staying longer than a couple of nights and want a hotel or B&B with a bit of charm or to relax in your room, this might not be the place. Maybe I'm asking too much for 135 Euros (February) but I reckon there's much better value to be had.", "Date": "March 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4346673", "Content": "We spent two nights at this hotel in November, I have to say it was excellent, room was spacious enough for a twin room, the staff friendly and helpful.

The location, WOW!! not sure we could have got better - a short walk from most of the central attractions of Rome. Also not very far from cafes and other places to eat. (we stayed Bed and Breakfast.)
