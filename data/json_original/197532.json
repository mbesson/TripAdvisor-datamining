The restaurant is not that big so there was often a queue.The hotel is conveniently situated for the Arc De Triomphe and other main Paris attractions . We went on a boat trip down the Seine using the Batobus but it is hop on hop off so if you want a non stoptrip i would suggest using the alternative boat trips .We also went to the Moulin Rouge which was very good .Paris was very busy with tourists but we found taxis and restaurants easy to get. It was a great trip and wish it had been longer than 3 days but maybe next time, I would definitely use the Sofitel again if only for the amazing beds", "Date": "Sep 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR414402300", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "LIZcc"}, {"Content": "Sofitel failed We booked one night, confirmed our arrival the night before and once we got to the hotel, WE WERE TURNED AWAY.

We arrived on a very hot Saturady afternoon by taxi from the airport ( I think we were ripped off as it cost 75 euros, and only 45 on the way back so don't get tauted like us) and found the hotel to be charming. The lobby was lovely and cool and the staff very friendly. Myself and my husband and my parents were allocated our rooms promptly but my brothers room wouldn't be ready until later on, it was already nearly 2pm at this point and he was rather disappointed he didn't have his own room in which to freshen up and put his things.Having been to the New York and Chicago Sofitels I was expecting great things and was slightly disappointed. There were all the trademark Sofitel touches; very comfortable beds, water in the room each night, lovely bar area, freindly staff, but it just didn't quite match the exquisitness of the others.The rooms were smaller, and didn't provide an iron or ironing board, the fridge was barely cool and the bathroom was well below prr compared to the others I have been to.Overal it was a nice hotel in a good location, and perhaps my negativity about the rooms is something that the hotel just can't overcome because of the building it is in, and I was perhaps expecting too much. Would I stay there again? Possibly, but I would need to take out a second mortgage - one round of drinks in the bar for 5 people cost 60 euros!!", "Date": "Aug 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR755089432", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gemstone_8"}, {"Content": "Luxury hotel in perfect location We stayed 3 nights in Paris for our first wedding anniversary and wow, all I can say, Sofitel Arc De Triomphe made it a truly amazing stay.

The lobby has a welcoming look with a bar just off the reception area that serves drinks and light snacks from early morning till late in the night. The staff is friendly and responsive with most if not all speaking fluent English besides other European languages. The rooms all have excellent wi-fi (or cable connected) internet service (free) and reasonably comfortable beds. The breakfast room serves up a sumptuous full breakfast and doubles as a fine dining restaurant for dinner with reasonably good value for money.The not-so-good:- Only two small elevators that are quite slow - especially if your room is on the 5th floor or up. Bathrooms are small with an absurdly high bathtub with a shower within that is shielded by a half glass. When taking a shower count on the water spilling on to the bathroom floor. The high tub is a challenge for short and/or older folks to get into. No drawers for laying out clothes if you're inclined to not live out of a suitcase other than two hard to reach shelves in the closets.

There's a good selection of local restaurants nearby. The building itself is a nicely renovated 19th century typical Parisian building. Rooms are a decent size without being huge. Certainly my room do not show any signs of the shabbiness referred to by one other reviewer. The air con did not seem to be working that well, but the temperature was still OK so not a big issue. It seems expensive, but casting around for my next trip I'm coming to the conclusion that it's just a reflection of the price you have to pay, especially in this location.

The room had a seperate coat closet, a small reception like area for receiving room service, a huge bathroom with vanity area, bathtub and a shower stall. The room, in addition to the king size bed had a table with chair, a big sofa with a coffee table, a flat screen TV with DVD player, a CD player with some classic musical CDs and a blacony with the view of the top of the eiffel tower. The staff were very friendly, taught us some phrases to get around the city, showed us the way to the train stations and suggested places to see. They also made our reservations for the various shows and a visit to the Versailles. I must mention the vast array of food they had for breakfast...A good variety of meats, juices, fresh fruits, pastries and breads that one would be stuffed past lunch time. There was also a live piano concert in the bar in the evenings. Arc De Triomphe was just a 5 minute walk away. The Lido was also a 5 minute walk away.

I've been to Paris several times and was familar with the general location and it happens to be a prime area.From the moment we arrived we were treated royally. We had deluxe category rooms and found them to be quite lovely. Nice size for Paris standards, very clean, robe/slippers a nice touch.Breakfast buffet was included and it was wonderful. Plenty of fruits, cereals, yogurt, delicious breads/pastries, eggs, etc. Wonderful staff.Our bags were delayed a couple of days the the hotel staff went out of their way calling the airline numerous times each day to get updates for us. I can't say enough about the staff and the guest relations people. Friendliest and most helpful. Even tolerated my 2 yr old level of French and never laughed at me.The staff and intimate nature of the hotel really made our vacation special (we were two daughters (early 50's) traveling with our two moms(early 70's and quite worldly).

Not that it was in a bad part of town, but if you are visiting Paris as tourist you will soon find out, that most of the City sites are not nearby.

Walking distance to many famous sites but the fact that the hotel is a couple of blocks off the major streets means that the street noise is minimal to nonexistent. Easy access to the metro system. The hotel has excellent curb appeal, a very nice lobby, and the greeting was quite friendly and professional. No real language barrier as all the staff (front desk, concierge, bellmen )spoke English quite well.  Our room was nothing short of great. Handsome, understated French decor (not the Louis XIV style we had seen in some T. A. photos). Tasteful prints on the wall, flat screen TV with free internet access, and exceedingly comfortable bedding/ linens (nice!). Our daughter had a comfortable roll away bed. The room was plenty big for the three of us. Great bathroom with separate room with commode. Excellent bath and shower products. The room safe was a little balky but they have a safe deposit at the front desk as a back up. Breakfast came with our package. It was very nice and relaxing. Hot and cold foods and very good coffee. Juices, bottled waters, fruit, pastries, etc. There are so many great places to eat is was hard to stay at the hotel for breakfast but we did and we enjoyed it. Free newspapers to include an international version of USA today (for those of us not interested in reading about soccer and cricket while in Europe). We very much enjoyed a dinner at Le Florimond Restaurant on 19 av. de la Motte- Picquet (on the left bank- a short cab ride). The owner- Pascal- is great. He is very friendly and went over the entire menu for us in English. Great food and wine- a memorable dinner in Paris.

Pre-paid a 4 night stay at the Sofitel through their website in order to get the lowest rate. I had been to Paris before but was going with my wife who had never been and wanted a hotel within walking distance of major Paris attractions. As the name of the hotel implies, the hotel is located about 2 blocks from the Arc de Triomphe and is a stone's throw away from the cheap Air France transfer bus from CDG airport. It's walkable to pretty much everything in Paris, and being in a residential neighborhood made it quiet at nights and in the mornings.I booked a deluxe king size non-smoking room and the size of the room was big by any standard, let alone Europe's. The room was very clean, and was full of many nice little extras, like free internet and a free bottle of water every morning. There was a temperamental mini-bar fridge that seemingly charged us a drink every time we just looked at it, but the front desk took it off our bill no questions asked. The only small gripe that I had about our room was the shower/tub and the half glass partition used instead of a full shower curtain or door. This seems to be the norm in Paris so I can't fault the hotel, but it did cause water to leak out onto the floor. No big deal since the bathroom was so large, it didn't matter.Of course, when talking about the Sofitel, one must gush on and on about the bed. Despite Paris being Paris, my wife and I have come back remembering that bed more than anything else...it is that good. (Or maybe my bed at home is that bad!) It is so obscenely comfortable, it makes getting out hard. It's the perfect thing when you've been walking around Paris all day carrying bottles of wine purchased from Fauchon.We ordered room service one night and the food was decent although not spectacular when considering the price. Otherwise, we ate all of our meals outside since food was better and cheaper. There's maid service during the day and then turndown service at night, so it was always nice coming home finding our bed ready every night.The last time I was in Paris I stayed at the Intercontinental, now the Westin (Place Vendome) for nearly twice the price of the Sofitel. Despite Place Vendome being a better location, the price difference and room difference will make me book the Sofitel again in a heartbeat. And adding in the fact that right next to the hotel was a BNP Paribas where I could get cash out of the ATM fee-free with my Bank of America ATM card 24 hours a day, and it's hard to find fault with the Sofitel Arc de Triomphe.", "Date": "May 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR408033224", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "TravelBugger3"}, {"Content": "Very Comfortable And Comforting The Sofitel is primarily a business hotel, but even as tourists on a 6 night stay we found it very comfortable.

The beds are extremely comfortable and after a day of walking a welcome respite. Keep an eye on the type of room, the first couple of rooms alloted were not quite up to par. One was too small for the size of bed and the other had an AC malfunction, the reception was helpful however and did get us a new room which was perfect.

We were not only annoyed by the problems themselves but the problems were made much worse by the couldn't care-less attitude of the staff. The concierges were very helpful but the front desk staff's behavior was totally unacceptable. My husband and I have travelled extensively and been to Paris many times and have NEVER encountered such an appalling lack of customer service. 1. Although our hotel room was on a non-smoking floor, the room reeked of cigarette smoke. When we complained to the woman at the front desk, she told us that we were on a non-smoking floor. We explained that we knew that; the hallways were find but the room smelled of smoke. We asked to be moved to another room; she said she had no more rooms. We told her we didn't smoke and the smell was making it hard for us to breathe. She said she understood and then told us that the hotel had a machine that could take care of the problem but that we had to be out of the room for 3 hours. We told her that would be just fine and we agreed upon a time. When we returned to the room, we now smelled some other substance that had been sprayed/infused in the room and could still smell the cigarette smoke under that.2. Although we don't often make use of minibars, we decided on our second day to purchase something. The minibar's refrigeration wasn't working, which meant everything was room temperature. We told the front desk people who said they would look into it. It was never fixed. 3. The hotel offers a take away breakfast which is supposed to include coffee, 2 pastries and juice or fruit. It's a great idea when you are on the run...if they fill the order accurately. One morning we decided to order it as we had booked an early morning bus tour to Giverny. When we went downstairs that morning they did not have a record of the order we had placed the night before but the staff person ran back to the kitchen and came out with 2 little bags. We were in a hurry now and so didn't check the contents of the bags. Although the order form we had filled out the night before asked us to specify which pastries we wanted and whether we wanted juice or fruit, the bags we were given did not contain the pastries we had ordered nor did they contain juice or fruit. When we returned to the hotel in the late afternoon and complained to the staff person at the desk, he told us he would look into it. We never heard anything more.IF the response from any of the front desk staff had included some kind of apology or acknowledgment or simply fixing of any of these problems, our stay at the Sofitel would not have been great, but we would not have been as annoyed.and exasperated. We don't expect perfection, but we do expect customer service.We will never stay at this hotel again and probably not at any other Sofitel, either.

The main problem was the noise at night from the plumbing system and the next room through the connecting door, and the very strong odour of cigarette smoke although we were on a non-smoking floor.Otherwise service was good and the best of all, breakfast was served till mid-day! Great for those who enjoy a lie-in. Location of the hotel is excellent - short walk to the Champs Elysee, the metro or the Air France bus stop to CDG.", "Date": "Jan 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR164001367", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Letstakeoff"}, {"Content": "Suite Review Recently stayed in this Hotel over the new year period. As a treat we took a suite. It was huge with spacious bathroom and separate toilet, hallway leading to huge living area with sofa, 3 tables and numerous tasteful chairs and wide-screen TV. The most beautiful curtained bed in separate room area and walkin wardrobe.I always rave about the beds in the Sofitels I have stayed in. They are just such a delight to sleep and laze in all morning. The living area also had French style doors opening onto a small balcony overlooking a residential apartment area and street / square. The staff were courteous and helpful. Room service was slightly slow but it was new years eve, and accompanied with a genuine apology for the time taken.The little extras in the room were extremely nice. The rubber duck in the bathroom / Hermes Eau De Toilette / Complimentary evian and a bottle of wine / Quality bath robes and huge fluffy towels and slippers. I also love the Roger  Gallet toiletries in the bathroom which is kept well stocked. The suites are expensive but worth the extra expense for a special occasion.The hotel has a good situation in a quite area within easy walk of the Arc de Triumph and just minutes from the Champs Elysees. The nearest Metro station is Charles de Gaulle Etoile and is also within walking distance situated below the Are de Triumph.Hotels / shops and bars are closely situated also.I just loved this hotel and will return again and next opportunity.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR612922610", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "STEVEFR"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel in great neighborhood My husband and I stayed in this hotel for three nights while celebrating our anniversary. Knowing the higher end hotels in Paris come at a higher rate, we did our homework when selecting this great spot. It is a real treat - small and intimate, super staff, and a great location.Our room was tiny and delightful, Roger and Gallet toiletries, a giant duvet and featherbed (we called our bed the Guimauve - the marshmallow it was so decadent and comfortable!). We had great robes, nice towels and slippers. The room service did take awhile to bring us our morning coffee, however we were never in a rush. The lobby provided a selection of french and english newspapers. The bar in the lobby often had a pianist playing for the guests as well.The only complaint I might have would be the fact that the doors slam all through the night, they are not on hinges that keep them from shutting quickly. Otherwise, it is close to walk to the Champs and easy to get to either the Charles de Galle metro or the George V metro station. Lots of little bistros and cafes close by too.", "Date": "Nov 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR703053872", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "dntngal"}, {"Content": "For Sofitel - OK I like the Sofitel brand, and utilise their hotels throughout Europe.
