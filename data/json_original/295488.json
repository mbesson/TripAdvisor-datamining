Each room has air conditioning. You get a good buffet breakfast in the rooftop Restaurant, the waiter who called himself Rambo worked hard hence you were looked after. The restaurant has a Panoramic view of the city, the sea, and the Hagia Sophia. They serve nice evening meals in the rooftop restaurant. Points to watch, the transfer from the airport (16miles) is I think too expensive at \u00c2\u00a320 each way making \u00c2\u00a340 return. You get driven at high speed through the Istanbul mad traffic the drivers dont care much about safety as our one was texting while driving!

Our arrangements were just a little unusual (because of our trip to Selcuk, we needed airport transfers on four occasions, and we also needed an additional room when our twenty-year-old son joined us part-way through our stay), but were managed almost seamlessly.

The Valide Sultan did not have a room for him for his first night, but they responded quickly and, despite its being my fault, took responsibility to remedy the situation.
