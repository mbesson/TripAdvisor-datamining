Firstly, several items disappeared from our room during our stay, I understand this is common for Spain and had chosen this hotel from a personal recommendation, where it was stated that this did not happen at this hotel. Finally, when we left we were presented with a mini bar bill of almost double what we had consumed. We were lucky not to be in a rush for our flight as it then took 20 minutes for the staff to go through our records and verify what I said. The problem here is that the original bill didn't include any multiples of anything from the correct bill, so the I cannot see how this was an honest mistake. This plus the painful slowness of the staff made me feel this was intentional on behalf of the hotel, as they know most people leaving do not have this length of time to wait for an ammended bill, and may not have checked the minibar prices in the first place. Also- not one for those wanting any fun on their romantic getaway. We heard a lot of noise from the bathroom next door and the corridor, so knew there was little privacy.

Personal favorite: the restaurant terrace on the stairs on the corner of Carrer d'En Tantarantana and Pla\u00e7a de Pons i Clerch, if only for the names of the streets. There are so many alleys going criss cross around this hotel that I find a new place for food & drinks every time I visit! Explore and enjoy. The interior is nothing special and quite character-free (insider tip: go outdoors to do sightseeing) but serves its purpose. Room is clean. Sleep is good.

Having got a taxi from the Airport, to ensure as much time as possible to enjoy the city centre and have a meal, you can imagine our disappointment to discover that our confirmed booking had been double booked. This is the one major error that any decent hotel should avoid at all costs. It would take up too much space and bore you to death if I were to go into all the details. We were told that there were no rooms available in Barcelona!!! However, they were able to offer a very substandard room in a group Hotel out in the suburbs. Needless to say the whole night was ruined. I asked to speak with the Manageress when we returned the following morning. This woman has no PR skills whatsoever and kept us waiting for a considerable period and without apology seemed to gloss over the matter. I suggested that we should not be charged for the night, instead she offered free breakfast for our stay. As we did not intend to have breakfast in the Hotel anyway, we rejected this offer. The matter could have been settled satisfactorily if she had even offered a reduced rate for the night. this was a great shame as we were happy with all other aspects of the Hotel.

The hotel staff was friendly, but not overly helpful. The room was clean, but very small. The bed creaked and the pillows were way too thin and there was only one per person. The bathroom fixtures were old and there were some unidentifiable broken fixtures on the walls. There was both a bathtub with a shower and a stand-alone shower, but the stand-alone shower was grubby-looking and had no light, so it was pretty much useless. Note that there was only one empty wall outlet in the room, plus the two that were being used by the television and the lamp. There was a fourth outlet next to the door, but there was a long corridor between the door and the rest of the room, making that outlet basically useless if we wanted to charge a phone or use a computer. We had to unplug the television because we needed the extra outlet. Another point worth mentioning is that we needed to pay a 50 euro deposit on the room safe, plus 5 euros a day to rent the lock for the safe. However, the WiFi was free (though a bit slow). Our deal included breakfast, which was pretty good, though a bit boring -- exactly the same breakfast every morning we were there, including the same hard-boiled or fried eggs. The location of the hotel is excellent -- right on the edge of the Barri Gotic and a 10-minute walk from Placa Catalunya. That said, the hotel entrance is not on the main street and there is no parking at the hotel or anywhere nearby that we saw (we did not have a car with us and our deal also included transportation to and from the airport). The area immediately surrounding the hotel looks a bit threatening at night and although I had no trouble walking around with my husband, I'm not sure how comfortable I would have felt as a woman alone.

When you leave the metro go and stand in front of the Arc D Troimf, you should have your back to traffic and be facing a long road that leads to a zoo in the distance. If you then turn 90 degrees to your right you will see Japanese restaurant (It has WOK written in big letters ) about 30 metres ahead. Walk to this restaurant. When facing the restaurant turn 90 degrees to your left and walk down the road for a few metres. You will then face a court yard with 3 sets of chairs in it. Walk straight through this court yard passing a construction site and you should then reach Rec Comtal. The hotel has flags draped outside of it.

Our one major issue was that it was extremely hard to find. It is easily accessible from the Arc d'Triomf metro station (costs 2.80 euros/person--from the airport, take the green shuttle to terminal 2, then metro 3 stops, transfer to track 8, then go 2 stops to Arc d'Triomf) but once you exit the station, no one seems to know where the actual street the hotel is on is! So, here's a tip for those of you taking the metro to the hotel...once you exit the metro at the Saint Joan exit, face the Arc d'Triomf (the park will be behind the Arc d'Triomf) and head to the right of the monument. You will be taking a small street (super easy to miss!) directly to the right of the monument. You have to walk through a small paved courtyard to get to the street. When you get to the small street, the hotel will be the second building on your left. The room itself was a very good size by European standards. The bed was a queen size--it was a little hard and springy, but it was comfortable enough. The pillows, on the other hand, were long and flat. They were not very good for sleeping! You could hear tons of noise from the hallway outside your room & the street below, so be prepared for that as well. There was individual heat control in the room (if you go in the winter, remember to turn the heat on or you will be very cold in your room!), as well as a desk area with a small TV. But, there was only one English channel (Bloomberg TV) which repeated the same shows & commercials over and over again. Wireless internet is free at the hotel. The bathroom was very, very nice. It was quite large & the shower was excellent. The location of the hotel was great as well. It was very easy to walk to all of the sights--Sagrada Familia, Las Ramblas...my husband & I were able to walk most of the city from our hotel. Most things were within a 15-20 minute walk, and, as earlier stated, the metro was very close by, so if you didn't want to walk, you could easily take the metro anywhere. The staff at the hotel was also very nice and they spoke English. One thing to note...the \"privacy please\" sign you hang on the door will only work for so long. My husband and I were only staying in the hotel for a few nights so we didn't want anyone in the room since we had electronic devices (iPod, DS, laptop computer) in our room. However, after a day and a half, the maids entered the room anyway. They didn't touch anything of ours, but they did blatantly ignore the do not disturb sign. All in all, I'd say it was a very nice hotel! I would definitely stay here again if I was traveling to Barcelona & I would recommend it to someone else to stay.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Israel", "Title": "\u201cGood value for money\u201d", "Author": "Slavabo", "ReviewID": "UR46642920", "Content": "Hotel is located near Arc Triumph , 15 min walk from Catalonia square.

I absolutely would not recommend this hotel to anyone! It is no more than a 2 star at best, with mean grouchy people working there.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "athens,greece", "Title": "\u201call in all a very good choice\u201d", "Author": "thai_feb", "ReviewID": "UR7479018", "Content": "My wife and and I stayed in the Catalonia Princesa for 4 nights in mid April 2007. The hotel is quite nice and as mentioned before, the higher floor your room is the quieter it gets. Being in walking distance to Rambla is very positive. The rooms are also nice but as far as the buffet , even though you have plenty of choices, the service was not as expected. First day we waited for clean glasses ,second day no croissants third day no coffee for more than 10 min. And a word of warning : if you have heavy baggage I would not recommend the metro . You have to change 2 lines to get to Arc de Triomf and there are a lot of stairs and waking. I think its easier to take the Airport bus to Placa de Catalunya and then bus n. 41,42 55,141 that take you to Arc de Triomf (only 3 or 4 stops away) without sweating up and down the metro stairs.

We arrived in the afternoon by Easyjet and enjoyed the stunning view of the Costa Brava resorts and Barcelona itself whilst coming in to land. We had read on the internet that the metro from the airport was closed for repairs and would not open during our stay so we took the airport bus to Placa de Catalunya instead (journey time 20 mins) and then wheeled our suitcases to the hotel (another 15-20 mins). Later we discovered that the metro was running and we used that on our return to the airport. On arrival, we were allocated a courtyard room on the 5th floor. The room was clean, nicely decorated and quiet and we made use of the minibar on occasion but not the TV as only the news channel was available in English. My only real complaint was the bed which was exceptionally hard. My husband and I both like a firm, orthopaedic mattress but this was ridiculous. After a hard days walking round Barcelona, we wanted to come back and rest before going out for the evening but this proved impossible. After 3 days we were so tired from lack of sleep we were grateful to leave to go to our next hotel up the coast in Calella. The breakfast buffet was lovely, we tried something different every morning and there was plenty of choice from cooked bacon and sausages to pastries, fruit salads etc. There is a bar next to reception which sells a small selection of drinks, however this was never open whilst we were there, possible because of the proximity of the ground floor rooms. There is a bar across the road but we did not visit this, prefering to walk through the street and alleys to the Born area where there are many lively bars and restaurants. We did not find the local area intimidating at all, it was atmospheric and far less touristy than the Ramblas area. We also enjoyed eating in the Barceloneta area, in the seafood restaurants overlooking the marina, and drinking in the beachside bar beside the Torre de San Sebastia. We went to Placa de Catalunya to get the tour bus and decided against the Bus Turistic due to the large queue. We opted instead for the orange Barcelona Tours bus. THIS WAS A MISTAKE - apart from being more expensive, the buses are far less frequent and run round in a giant circle, meaning that to visit the sights, you must follow the order of the bus. It also stops much earlier at night as we discovered, having been stranded outside Poble Espanyol at 8pm, we watched dejected as 4 Bus Turistic's passed by and we ended up walking downhill to catch the metro. This worked out in our favour as we were able to watch the fabulous fountain display, Font Magica de Montjuic. We heard the music and saw the top of the fountain from Poble Espanyol and thought we had missed the show, not realising it goes on for hours. On leaving the hotel return, we took a taxi to Barcelona Sants (8 euros) and caught the local train to Calella. We were surprised when the train stopped at the Arc de Triomf station 5 mins from the hotel, which we thought was a metro station only. All in all, we had an excellent time in Barcelona and I can't recommend it enough. We hope to return next year but we shall try a different hotel where hopefully we will get a better sleep!", "Date": "November 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel for the price\u201d", "Author": "T&BG", "ReviewID": "UR6027151", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights in Oct. 2006 before we went on a cruise.

There is a lobby bar, but there are rooms on the same floor as the bar so you have to be quiet. The breakfast is decent, but if you don't want to pay for it, you're not missing much. Definitely walk around Las Ramblas at night, but don't drink there.
