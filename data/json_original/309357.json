{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Character Plus I stayed at the Tjampuhan with my 9 year old son in early December 2008, and was very impressed. We were very happy with the room and the bathroom, and the view from the balcony was amazing! It is true that there are lots of steps, but since it's built on a hillside over a river, that is hardly surprising. We asked for a room near the top, and it was quickly provided. Our request for an electric jug and a fridge were also quickly dealt with. My only negative feelings were that at a hotel of this calbre, a fridge and jug should be standard in every room. The fridge that was provided was not very clean, and it is important to attend to these small details. The main pool was beautiful, and extra space for sunbathing was provided down a few steps, next to the bar. The banana pancakes are also awesome - my son ate about 6 each day!!I found the staff to be charming and helpful and sincerely interested in us. It is a beautiful, tranquil spot and I would stay there again in a heartbeat, next time with my partner.", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR497024524", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SweetOtter"}, {"Content": "Amazing place to stay We stayed at the Tjampuhan and found the stay absolutely amazing.

My husband and I just returned from a week in Ubud, Bali. We stayed at the Hotel Tjampuhan Spa on the western edge of Ubud central. It is gorgeously situated on a hillside surrounded by a virtual tropical jungle overlooking the confluence of two sacred rivers. Service was graciously attentive and unfailingly polite and solicitous. We had the most delicious breakfasts ever anywhere. The banana crepes are simply scrumptious....I'm craving them right now. And the rice porridge every morning is just what this Chinese girl loves to have in the morning, even in the heat and humidity -- it was very satisfying. And the eggs cooked to order, you haven't had eggs until you taste these. I had a wonderful 2-hr spa treatment for $38 US - an hour whole body massage followed by a body scrub and yogurt treatment capped by a warm bath in fragrant oils and beautiful fresh flower petals. I was served lemon ginger tea as I bathed. It was heavenly. The spa is at river's edge, as you receive your treatment, you are lulled by the sound of falling water, the buzz and chirp of the jungle and the warm sweet fragrance of frangipani blossoms.....you have to pinch yourself to believe that you are really there. It is an unbelievable experience. I highly recommend this hotel with no hesitation, except one warning that there are many steps to traverse up and down because the hotel is built into the hillside; those with impaired mobility would have difficulty going to and fro, I'm afraid to say.", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR419115306", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Lilo888"}, {"Content": "Fantastic hotel right in the jungles!!

The Tjampuhan is lovely - the setting is lush jungle with a river below. A short walk to the town (around 10 minutes), the hotel also offered a shuttle bus and if times weren't convenient, then transport was easy to find outside the hotel - and cheap too! I would recommend requesting a room away from the road as it can get very noisy with motorcycles and trucks. We booked an interconnecting Raja room direct with the hotel months before we arrived and specifically asked for a room off the main road. One was not available when we arrived and we were shown to a room which was almost on the road! We did complain and were shown some other available rooms. The hotel handled our complaint extremely well and they bent over backwards to keep us happy - we were also given free massages and a dinner in the restaurant for the booking confusion.We took another room called River 1 which was even better for us as it was a huge double storey loft room with the kids sleeping upstairs in the loft and us downstairs. The room was lovely - however in need of a little renovation ( the bathroom was out of the 1950's!). It had huge comfy beds, 2 balconies and was very peaceful. It was a distance from the reception but was never a problem for us or the kids - we felt the stairs helped us burn off our meals! We had read some other reviews and requested a fridge for our stay. There was a store almost opposite the entrance to the hotel so we were easily able to stock it with cool drinks. We did love the fact there was no tv, and the kids just watched dvds on our laptop. wi fi was available in the restaurant and reception areas which was handy for my husband.All in all, it was great to stay at an Ubud icon. A lovely setting, nice pools, quiet location, but could do with a little attention.PS - If you are feeling cashed up, have a dinner out at Mosiac restaurant.

The hotel was built in the 60's and is very spread out, consisting of chalets built on different levels, directly above a ravine. There were many steps to reach our room (I did not mind the exercise given that we ate more than usuall and it was the chance to burn off calories!) The room was decorated in an old style and had tasteful furniture and a stunning view of the lush trees and vegetation overlooking the ravine. You sat on your comfortable chairs and could watch squirrels and listen to the birds. However we were a little disapointed at the lack of facilities eg there was no bar fridge (Bali is very hot: you need cold drinks and beer), no hairdryer, kettle and cups etc and no TV or even a radio, which you would expect from this standard of hotel. We thought maybe the management considered it impractical for them have TV's in the rooms, as the walls are thin and you could hear you neighbours talking very clearly and therefore a TV late at night be more of a disturbance. I will give them due credit that we did ask for a fridge and a hairdryer and they were able to provide them. They had a 'musty feeling' TV room and dvd player which we used and no other guests did, however there were not too many English chanels available. Our solution was to buy videos at the supermarket in Ubud for $2. The food was very good and the service excellent,all the staff are so friendly. The pool is nice and the was a spring pool too. The spa was a little pricy (15 American dollars was just for using the pools) but a unique experience as it is a very ornately decorated groto nr the ravine with a hot pool and an icy one side by side.An added bonus was they provided a free shuttle service into Ubud, which is also walking distance.I did enjoy staying at this hotel very much, despite the lack of facilities(dont let this put you off as you can ask for the electrical things if you want them) it's beauty and character did make up for it.", "Date": "Apr 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR763134293", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "suzieH71"}, {"Content": "great place to relax We stayed for 4 nights in the Arie Smit 2 in Hotel Tjampuhan and had a magnificent time.

This idyllic setting truly must be seen to be believed. Leaving a typical Balinese village street scape you are transported into a tranquil fantasy when you walk through the door.Ok, enough of my aspiring Mills and Boon **!!. My fiance and I have just returned from a trip to Bali where we spent the final 2 nights and 3 full days at the Tjampuhan Hotel in Ubud. The hotel is set over several hectares of rainforest / jungle and small clusters of 3 or 4 adjoining villas are spread throughout the grounds. The rooms are clean and comfortable with huge beds and serviced daily. The bathrooms more than adequate and impeccably clean. The resort has two pools (one is naturally spring fed and incredibly refreshing.) The spa is a must, carved stone walls surrounding natural plunge pools and massage beds in the rainforest overlooking the river. Wow !! (see pics attached) The restaurant is great and the food is terrific, as usual with resorts there is no doubt that food is cheaper elsewhere in the town, but hey this is Bali, so whatever is expensive is still ridiculously cheap !! A free shuttle takes you to and from the town at your leisure (pretty long walk otherwise) and taxis are cheap enough (about $3 AUD).Things to be aware of at the hotel, (these were in no way a problem for us and actually added to the feeling of escaping back to nature). There are no fridges, tea / coffee facilities or televisions in the rooms. (At least not the type we stayed in - there are two types and we chose the Raja as it has air con). Apparently fridges can be requested and are literally carried to your room if required. But the simple press of a phone button will have anything you desire brought immediately to you. (i.e. tea in the morning). The service in this regard and every other of the friendly staff was superb.There are a lot of stone steps, so not ideal for the frail or physically impaired. Ubud itself was wonderfull and we wish we had stayed here longer. However, we will most definitely be back and the Hotel Tjampuhan is where we will stay.", "Date": "Apr 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR388979757", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Matt_and_Leisa"}, {"Content": "Stunning This is really a pearl ... in the jungle.Fantastic wooden bungalows, with all comforts in a valley in the middle of the tropical forest.

It was lovely. As others have noted, the scenery is breathtaking. There really are not a lot of hotels with similar views in Ubud that are also convenient to town and reasonably priced. The rooms themselves were quite decent if not super luxurious. Bathroom was a bit 1980's and needs upgrading. If you just care about room (not the setting/view or convenience to town or resort pool, spa and restaurant) you can do better than this hotel. Balcony was big and had a great view. I loved this. Cleaning staff did a very good job and overall staff was super obliging and friendly. As previous writer noted they did seem to very much appreciate any tips but then who doesn't? One negative point was that staff was overly eager to volunteer offers for personal tours, personal art work, referrals to relatives' shops, investment opportunities, etc. Nice touches like flowers on the sheet turn-down every night. The hotel facility was really charming. Built in the 1920's of stone into the side of a hill overlooking a river. If you have any mobility issues though, hotel is not for you. Lots of steep steps. Hotel restaurant is excellent. I chose to eat there many times because food was so good. Service great too. You can also have food sent to either pool or your room. Daily breakfast buffet or you can have breakfast in the room. Try the french toast! Yum. Drivers will take you wherever you want to go pretty much whenever you want to leave (7 am to 11 pm) in a nice air conditioned minivan. They pick you up from town too. You are close enough to town to walk it in maybe 10 minutes but I always seemed to be going to a specific place in town so got a lift. Spa massage was pleasant enough and the setting was really wild. You have to see the grotto. Massage itself was in pavilion overlooking the river gorge. Very nice. I believe they have spa meals too if you want to eat extra healthy or vegetarian.

Just returned from a 5 night stay:The hotel is ideally located in Central Ubud - very convenient to town, restaurants, etc. Setting of hotel is stunning ! Hotel is built on side of ravine, with beautiful river at bottom. Gave us the feel of being in a lush jungle.Hotel offers complimentary shuttle service anywhere in Central Ubud. (they say, shuttle departs hourly; however they were ALWAYS avail to take us at whatever time we needed).We stayed in River 3, gorgeous view right at the river and next to the Natural Spring Swimming Pool. The room had a huge front terrace that overlooked the river! The room's interior and bathroom were just okay. Furniture was a tad dated, but in good condition. Housekeeping was NOT GOOD! It was obvious that room had only been given surface cleanings vs. periodic deep cleanings. There was LOTS of dust and grime (kind of like smoker's grease!) on lamp shades, paneling, telephone, and light switches.Ate in main restaurant for dinner on 2 occasions. Food was good, and fairly priced. Breakfast buffet each morning was fine: Coffee/Tea, choice of 2 juices, 3 fresh fruit offerings, banana crepes, sausage, hash browns, sausage, rice, and omelet station were the norm each day.The overall service at this hotel was fair... the staff really didn't seem that enthusiastic about their jobs...a few smiles and pleasantries here and there; but for the most part -they were quite dower.Supposedly tipping is optional / not necessarily the norm in Bali (per books we had read). On most bills you will be charged plus plus - tax  tip.Being from the West, we typically like to give some extra - to make it 15 - 20% based on service, and did so on Bali.Periodically we'd get so-so service and would just stick with the plus plus. You should have seen the disappointment in the server's eyes! Also, on check out day, ALL come around to say hello, good bye, and come back to see us! (I felt like all had their hands out !)... So, whatever you read in the tour books about how tipping is optional, please note, it is NOT optional (it is expected !)Again, the location of the T'Jampuhan is great, and the scenery just gorgeous.
