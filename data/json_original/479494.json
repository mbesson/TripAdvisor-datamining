{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Location We were in Japan on a business trip and we wanted to spend our last night in the Shibuya area. This hotel is convenient to the Shibuya train station. You can easily walk to the hotel with your luggage. The room was a typical Tokyo hotel room, very small. It was clean and the internet worked great. The room included breakfast which was quite good. The room rate was also quite reasonable for a Tokyo hotel. The best part is the location of the hotel because it is in the heart of Shibuya area with restaurants, shops, clubs and a lot of young people. We travel to Japan often on business and if we need to stay in Shibuya again, we would stay at this hotel.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR425654983", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SBCATraveler"}, {"Content": "Great location This Hotel is located a couple of 200 meters from Center Gai and 100 meters fra Haitcko crossing where you also find Shibuya station. Shibuya is a very Lively neigbourhood with many shops, bars and fine dining.It's a 15 minutes walk to Yoyogi park and Harajuko.I think you get more value for money if you for instance stay in Akasaka (3 stops from Shibuya on the Ginza line) where it's a bit more quiet than Shibuya. But if you want to stay where the fun is stay in Shibuya.The hotel is average. Nice little building and reception. The rooms are very small compared to hotelrooms in US, but i think this is normal for Tokyo. Very small bathroom. The recepionist spoke a little english just enough to get the information we needed. The rooms are a little worn down, and the atmosphere of the room was not nice. But the best part of this hotel is the loaction.We also stayed at Tobu Hotel in Shibuya and that was better value for money. The hotels in Shibuya are quite pricey compared to other parts of Tokyo. Next time we will probably stay in Cerulan Tower (300 meter from Shibuya station) or Excel City (above the Shibuya station).", "Date": "Jul 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR412868781", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "rudilund"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel, I would stay here again I love this hotel. It was easy to find and in an excellent area. It's one block from Shibuya Station. The rooms aren't huge, but were very clean. This is not a luxury hotel, but for the value, I really wouldn't stay anywhere else. It's in the heart of Shibuya and steps away from excellent shopping, bars and restaurants. Everything is literally right outside the hotel. The staff don't speak great english, but they were functional and very friendly.

Very close to Shibuya station, making it easy to catch the subway/taxis for appointments. You can also take the Narita Express to/from Narita Airport (direct in the mornings and evenings). The hotel room was very small but that's normal in Japan. It had free and fast internet access. The breakfast - Western-style and Japanese - varied from day to day and was better than I have had in many, much grander Tokyo hotels.

Half a block from the JR a block from Shibuya Crossing, near shopping, bars and restaurants. Yet, as other reviewers have mentioned the rooms are quiet - no street noise. In addition to a great location the rooms are comfortable and clean. My non smoking room request was granted and the whole floor appeared to be smoke free. Each room has free high speed (wired) internet and pretty slick tv with regular channels as well as pay per view. The bed was comfortable and the kimono and memory-foam pillow were nice touches.I would definitely stay here again.

Loved the classy lobby and the luggage hold service which allowed us to store our luggage in their facilities for free before our 3pm check in to our room.The rooms were comfortable and cosy with spotless linen and the slippers and kimono provided proved of use after a long day exploring the city on our feet!However, I wouldn't reccommend this hotel if you were really tall though- the bathrooms were tiny and were the size of those on cruise ships. That said, it was clean and neat so we didn't mind.The location is only a 3 minutes walk from Shibuya JR station and surrounded by heaps of shops and eateries.Overall it was a pleasant stay and well worth the money.
