My 21 day holiday started in London, then Paris, Venice, Florence and finally ended in Rome. Every hotel we stayed in out did the last and we were enjoying every bit of our holiday and then we went to Rome! When the transfer company struggled to even find the hotel, I started to get a bit concerned. The hotel is literally hidden in a dingy & dodgy dead end. We were greeted with, \" sorry we can't assist with your luggage, there's no porter at this hotel!\" Firstly, the attitude of the hotel manager was appalling. He clearly demonstrated that he was highly frustrated with his job and that he didn't have the owners best interest in mind. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and regretted every second of it. I cannot understand why my travel agent even booked this dreadful hotel compared to the rest of the hotels for this holiday. Secondly, the room had a damp stench in it and the beddings to the carpets on the floor were kept in horrid condition. My daughter compared the bathroom/toilet to that of a hospital. My biggest problem was the blatant attitude towards the hotel guests. Does the management team at this hotel not realize that they need the tourists future business?? Would it hurt them to at least pretend to be friendly??Just based on the hotel managers comment to the couple that was robbed in December, he was not apologetic just defensive!! The owner of this establishment should genuinely look into sending some of his staff on some service and hospitality courses and look into these criticisms constructively.

The room was simple but clean and everything was working except the cooler, but possibly no one uses the cooler in December in Italy but us. The reception staff was helpful and able to help and advise us also on how and where to go in Rome. The breakfast area was characteristic with simple but diverse food also taking in account international travelers. (butter and milk etc.) The old Italian lady providing breakfast and my mom became best friends though they could only talk with hands and feet, but things like that make such a trip more memorable.

The always spoke very rudely and treated his guests and if he is doing and favor to them by letting uthem stay there . On our first night , the hotel put us in a very small corner room which was big enough for monkeys to stay in ; it was only after our persistent requests did they gave us another slightly bigger room . even in that room , the shower was too small for an average size person to use it without hitting walls on all sides. They shut off the A/C in the middle of the night and when we inquired about the same in the morning , we were told that we should help them in saving electricity !!!, i can;t believe that someone would say that as an explanation to let the guests sleep in a room without proper cooling !!!! :( . The breakfast is strictly ok , not too much to eat anyways in what they provide . This hotel is a very very average one , stay in this hotel if you are unable to find anything else .Only the location is its saving grace !! Would not recommend this hotel to anyone", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, CA", "Title": "\u201cDecent No Frills Hotel for a few days\u201d", "Author": "SXA", "ReviewID": "UR68019610", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Corona between June 1st and June 4th. The hotel is within walking distance of the Termini station. I would like to summarize our experience in bullet points: Close to Termini Station Free Wi-Fi . However in the room the signal was very weak and disappeared after midnight. It was puzzling to them as well. Clean Rooms Daily Housekeeping (except the first day when it appears they forgot) Free Breakfast (being from America it seems sparse, but its typical) Good Cappuccinos at Breakfast (We love the older lady who makes the cappuccinos she is wonderful) Very helpful staff. They speak excellent English. They have a street vendor market outside that sets up at 5am or so and it can be disruptive if you are facing the street. The market sells all kinds of things like Fruits, Household items, Clothes etc. This seems quite typical all over Italy where these markets get set up right on the street. They have signs saying no food allowed in the rooms..which seemed rather odd to us, since did that mean we could not even buy fruit or snacks to eat in the room? The stand up shower is small, and they had a shower curtain which did not cover the entire length of the shower so you had to be very careful not to cause flooding of the bathroom. Plenty of hot water. Bed was basic but reasonably comfortable. Pillows were hard (I am used to down pillows so perhaps thats why it felt that way to me). My girlfriend said it had more of a hostel feel to it than a hotel but in this price range I guess its typical. One morning they were playing some music in the hallway speaker which woke her up at 7am. Elevator is very tiny, if you are in the least bit claustrophobic you may want to take the stairs.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cMixed Feelings\u201d", "Author": "scuderia21", "ReviewID": "UR67661183", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel Corona for two nights while holidaying in Rome. Let's start with the good. It is very near Termini station which is the central station in Rome, so if you intend to take the train and metro everywhere in Rome (highly recommended!) it is very convenient. Also I love the lounge area which is very homely with it's big sofas and spacious quiet ambience. Breakfast was pretty good as well. However, it stops there. You had to pay 5 euros for the wi-fi which I couldn't receive any signal in my room, and I had to go to the lobby area everytime I wanted to use the internet. But the thing that really annoyed me was there was no room service. They had indicated that if you place your towels on the floor they would replace it for you. So we did, and went out the entire day to tour the city. When we returned at night, we realised nothing was done and we ended up using towels that had been left on the toilet floor again to dry ourselves. Also, we had already purchased tickets for the Vatican but would like to join a tour offered by the hotel, but we asked if we could pay the tour fee minus the ticket price, but they said no and didn't bother to help or be flexible. They just told me to throw my ticket away and join their tour.

The rooms, which comprised of double, twin and single accommodation, were very clean and serviced daily and although not particularly large, were big enough. Bathrooms had showers, complimentary soap, shower cream and hair dryer. A couple of our rooms found the toilet cistern extremely slow to re-fill after flushing so appeared initially to be in need of repair. Not good if you are rushing to leave the room! Because the hotel was busy, we were asked to give a time when we wanted breakfast. This was a continental breakfast which was buffet style and consisted of the usual fruit juices and hot drinks, and also, rolls and sliced breads, a toaster, cereals, an enormous glass bowl of fruit salad, plain yoghurt, one or two meats, cream cheese, a selection of jams and marmalade, and various cakes. There was never a need to rush this in the mornings. Although the hotel web-site did give details of an evening menu, there was no evidence of it providing any food other than the breakfast. Probably the only minus for the Corona was that there was no hospitality tray in the rooms and no other way to get tea or coffee - no machines in the reception area or room service. We had a meal in the Trattoria next door on our last night and wished we had eaten there earlier. An excellent meal, very good value and probably the best food we had whilst we were there. The hotel is very well placed near the Termini station and the beautiful Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, and central enough to walk to all the city's remarkable sights.

We haven't travelled much, so arriving in Europe for the first time (in the rain) and navigating Rome as our first stop, it was much appreciated that the hotel was four blocks away. We planned on no taxis, no subways (and no bus in Rome), and getting there walking with our (carry-on) luggage was no problem. The hotel is close to Santa Maria Maggiore church. It is a bit of a hike to most other spots. We are young, healthy, and cheap - we walked twenty minutes to Vittorio Emanuel monument, 25 min to the Coliseum, 30 min to the Spanish Steps, and 35 min to the Vatican. If you dread walking on cobblestone and giving your knees and feet a workout, the hotel is a bit far from these sites. I'm not sure if it is a Rome thing, but we got better value at hotels in other cities in Europe. The room was fine, clean enough. The bathroom was small but it did the job. The tiny elevator was neat, and for those that complained about the size I thought it was a good effort on their part - the building was never designed to have an elevator! The breakfast room was cozy, and the breakfast was great -- this was the highlight of the hotel. Enjoyed the variety of fruit, juice, items to toast, and cereal. No complaints about the staff. However, we were puzzled on our last day - we got to Santa Maggiore Church early in the morning for Sunday Mass and it was locked. We asked the front desk, and they had no idea why. We even told them what time we thought it was, but later (after arriving an hour early for our train to leave Rome) we found out that the Europeans had switched their clocks back to standard time. Being tourists, and them being a hotel, I was surprised they never figured that out! Thank God it was not April, or we would have been an hour late and seriously annoyed instead of an hour early with a funny story to tell.

Maria Maggiore Church (for the Catholics-must go to this beautiful church), we even walked to Colosseo, Pantheon, Piazza di Spagna, Fontana di Trevi etc, not too hard as we enjoyed the historic scene all around. Supermarket - we always returned late at night (after 9 to 10pm), we visited the Conad Supermarket at Termini Station every night for supplement of fruit, water, yoghurt etc. It closes at midnight, you can even buy fresh baked pizza and fresh roasted chicken here. Later, we found one local supermaket - Tuodi, very nearby to Corona Hotel. It located at the end of Via Urbana, no big brand identification, buy you can see many local people walk-in and out and carried its plastic bag with its shop name. Its price was much cheaper then Conad (the one in Termini Station). For example, the cheapest water of 1.5L here was just selling Euro 0.19 while Conad was selling Euro 0.65 (of course different brands), for 1 kg of fresh peach, Tuodi was selling Euro 0.49 while Conad was selling Euro 1.99. But Tuodi closes 8:30pm daily and even more earlier on Sunday. Conad's open hour is more convenient for night shoppers. Termini Station - It is a big shopping mall as well, different cafes and restaurants, 2 big bookshops, boutiques etc. We bought EuroStar train tickets here to visit Firenze and Pisa by using the ticketing machines. Daily market near to hotel - Our room were faced to the main entrance located at 4/F, we didn't hear any noise from the market in front of the hotel. It's a lovely market selling cheap local things, like fruit, clothes, shoes etc. Just operating for a few hours from early morning and all stalls close before 11am. The first day when we arrived at around 10 o'clock something in the morning, only the fruit stalls were still operating. Bad-manned host - There was a lady in the hotel lobby when we firstly arrived (may be the wife of the host because it is a family run hotel). She's nice but once she knew that we were travelled together with our 9 years old daughter, she seemed frustrated and called out the host - Mr. Luciano (the father). After she told him our case, Mr. Luciano got mad and lost his temper at once. He yelled to us that we needed to pay extra Euro 40 per night for our daughter. We kept smiling and explained to him peacefully that we bought an airline package in Hong Kong, the package already included air-tickets and hotel charges for three of us, we should not pay any extra in Rome. I even pointed to him that three of our names were shown on our hotel vouchure, I told him that we didn't cover the truth. But he's still keeping angry and shown his order booking form (from their Europe agency) to us. In his order booking form, only my husband and my name were shown, so he insisted we needed to use a Triple room instead of a Twin room. As we booked 4 nights there, so I suggested that I could share bed with our daughter and my husband sleep in another bed. But he kept to yell to us that child over 2 years old is not allowed to share bed with parents in their hotel. I turned a little bit angry up to this moment because of his bad-temper not because of the extra-pay he asked, I didn't want to lose my temper as well, so I use my mobile to dail a long distance call to our travel agency in HK to clarify this case. He promised to verify with their Europe agency and call later. So, my husband told Mr. Luciano that we only pay the extra when we check out. Then Mr. Luciano started to show his first smile to us and promised we could settle the extra payment when check-out later. Our HK agent settled this case with the Europe agent later, we didn't need to make any extra payment. We were luckied to meet both good service HK and Europe agencies, but we were not in luck to meet this bad-manned Mr. Luciano once we arrived Rome. Please pay attention that there may be more then two Mr. Luciano working in this hotel, may be father and son(s). For those young men we met when we returned lately at night (they usually stay in the night shift at Reception lobby) were very nice and good manned. Hotel FREE Gift - In Corona's web site, they wrote : \"GIFTS: for who stays at least 4 days has a free reservation in Villa Borghese gallery and a free Wifi card with un limited connection!\" (you can read this even up-to-date : Sep-09). When we asked the reception lady (the lady we first met when we checked-in) about the FREE Wifi card, she turned her face and replied no FREE Wifi card, customer need to pay (seemed Euro 5 / hour) to use their Wifi at lobby. I explained as we noted a free Wifi card would be provided during our stay, so we brought along with our own notebook PC and wanted to use it in our room, but she insisted no such service. So we gave up to ask anymore. Our Room - the room was small-sized, after placed a double bed (combined 2 single beds) and a single bed, not much area left. A single bed just around 2.5 feet width, may not very comfort for big people. Bath room was OK, 2 pcs of soap and a hanging holder with liquid soap were provided, you need to bring along your own amenities. See photo attached. Housekeeping - promptly and efficiency. But they didn't change any white bed sheets as well as the pillow cases during our 4 days stayed. They just made them good, we found they were all have goffer every night when we returned. See attached photo. Room safe - it's very small only fit for two purses only, the smallest safe I ever seen in the hotels around the places I travalled. Guest need to pay to use it (seemed Euro 5 per night), it's unreasonable. Mini Bar - no Mini Bar was found in the room, as we were visiting during hot summer, we were disappointed for we could not keep any cold drink in the room.

Hotel breakfast - a very elegant and nice breakfast room, very diligent and good-mannered ladies were working there. They were very busy during the breakfast time, not easy to find a seat during peak hour (after 9am) on weekend. My first favourite was their fruit bowl, freshly cutted, many different kinds of fruit were included (I always saw the ladies refilled all other food frequently but not included this fruit bowl). I also loved their pie very much, 3 flavours - blueberry, cheery and caramel. Pies, breads, rolls, ham, corn flakes, juice, coffee, tea were served, a good start for us in a day.

I'd stay here again for a night if I wanted to be near the railway station.", "Date": "September 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cJust okay\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1756061", "Content": "Hotel Corona was okay. It was much farther from town than we expected, but it still was not bad. If I go back to Rome, I would stay somewhere closer to the tourist attractions and not so far away. It is definintely walkable, but it is located on a small, small sidestreet, so it is difficult to find at night or really anytime. The rooms were nice. The breakfast was terrbible, as they didn't have much to choose from. Also, they had no where to store bags all day. That was the main thing I did not like. We had a 7 pm flight and checkout is at 10 am. We wanted to go to the Vatican all day, but large bags are not allowed. He told us to just sit them in the lobby and they will be fine. I didn't really like the idea of that. They could at least have a room where they store it so it is not on display to everyone. There are a lot of pickpockets in Rome, so I did not trust this at all. They are also supposed to provide you with tour info and maps and they did not. It was okay overall, but I would not stay there again. For the price we paid, we could have gone elsewhere.", "Date": "March 30, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Corona Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d264642-Reviews-Corona_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$98 - $231*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Napoli 3</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">00184 Roma</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00184</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "264642", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/64/68/83/exterior-of-hotel-corona.jpg"}}
