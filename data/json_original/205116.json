The room was made up every day while we were out. Breakfast was served between 7:30 and 9:30pm and was standard continental fayre. There was a bit of a squeeze sitting at some tables in the breakfast area. The ancient Roman forum was 15 minutes walk down the Via Nazionale, and Termini Station a similar distance.

The reason this hotel is rated as 'one star' is because no reception is within the hotel block. However, please note that a 24 hr reception is available within 50 metres away from the hotel - no big deal to walk 50m! The hotel is warm and clean. The cleaners make sure you have everything you need. The windows of the hotel do not stop sound from entering the room but its not like you're on a highway! This hotel is located about 100m away from Via Nazzionale. The sound problem did not bug us at all but it might bug some people who are too sensitive to noise. If that's the problem them go to Hawaii not Rome :) Breakfast room is way too small for the hotel and the breakfast is nothing extraordinary....but hey...considering the price you pay for this hotel...its still very good! You get bread, orange juice, cofee, cake, crossaints etc... The bread was a bit dry and I do recommend that the management take note of this. So my advice is: if you are looking for a warm, cheap, clean place to stay in the centre of Rome (walking distance from all attractions!)...and you are not expecting a silver service, then I will highly recommend this hotel. Again, do not worry about the '1 star' rating...in fact, you will wonder why it is a '1 star' at the end of your holiday.

We picked this hotel because we were on a tight budget and were looking for something cheap and cheerful. That is almost what we got. We chose this hotel as we used online reviews and the majority of them claimed this to be a great hotel. We can only say this was an OK hotel. Firstly this is not really a hotel, is appears as if it is overflow rooms for the Hotel Caravaggio across the street, where you check in and out. The room was ok, small, very much a budget room although you are not paying budget prices, and the air conditioning did not work properly. In the heat of Rome city in June the air conditioning did nothing to comfort us, it also let in an awful lot of mosquitoes which didn't make us anymore comfortable. On arrival, we didn't exactly get a warm welcome, even though we were soaked to the skin from rain, we were made wait to check in, although there was no other guests checking in. We were then brought across the street, to the first floor of a separate building, which houses a few rooms, this making up the Hotel Picasso, from what we could see. It came across as if these used to be old staff rooms which they converted to guest rooms although for the price you are charged for them there was not much effort put into them. There is internet access in the lobby of the Hotel Caravaggio across the street, they also held a 'Happy Hour' there in the evenings. The location was ok, just off Via Nazionale, a main street with shops and restaurants, with Piazza della Repubblica at the top. Besides this all of the other attractions were a good walk away. We personally would never stay here again, and I would tell my friends that if they have that much money to spend on a hotel to look elsewhere as this is not worth the money. We stayed in other hotels in Italy and got a much better deal for half the money, although keeping in mind this is Rome.

Order an 'Amaro' (liqor) with your espresso after the home made tiramisu or panna cotta! A lot of Italians there, and a waiting queu after 19.15. (Order the daily specials!) So come in time! There is also a nice patisserie on number 11/13. (next to the restaurant) which totally makes up for the breakfast at the hotel, which is not much. All together, we really had a nice stay!

I only stayed long enough to leave my suitcases and venture out into the neighborhood. It wasn't until I came back in the evening that I realized I had found a gem! Everything has been totally renovated and the room was spotless. New tile floors, headboard, and bathroom fixtures made the atmosphere clean and cozy. The bathroom was small, but nicely designed. The neighborhood is really convenient and safe, and only a few blocks from the train station and shuttle busses to the airport (by the way, you can buy shuttle tickets from the hotel across the street from where the busses line up for quite a discount). There are cafes, stores and everything you need nearby - this is a real Roman neighborhood, NOT a typical tourist area, so I found that a welcome relief after traveling around for a couple of weeks! Having had enough pizza and pasta for a while, I actually ended my stay in Italy by having Chinese food at a little cafe a couple blocks away from my hotel! I had good service and they called a cab for me at 5:30 am so I could get to the airport on time. I really recommend this hotel to anyone who wants an economical, clean and pleasant place to stay while in Rome. Probably not the place to stay if you are planning on spending a lot of time in the room, since it's pretty small, but it was spotless.

It is close to the Colosseum (10 min. walk). Many attractions are geographically clumped together (Trevi, Campodiglio, Spanish Steps), and Picasso is a 10 minute walk from the edge of that \"clump.\" I would've preferred being more central. Rooms/Hotel: Decent sized triple by European standards w/ smallish, rather inconvenient bathroom. Clean, and nicely decorated. Room faced street which was a bit noisy. Italian tv only. Shower curtain was too small so there was a large pool of water after our showers. We asked for extra towels twice to no avail. Etc.: Adequate breakfast for a budget place - bread, fresh coffee, unlimited cereal, juice. Breakfast room is so tiny that at times there are people waiting for a table. Staff was friendly, but I have one complaint - at check-in, we were told we had to pay cash because the credit card machine was broken. I told the front desk that getting this much cash was a problem for us on short notice (I had recently been mugged), but they just smiled and shrugged. After getting the cash (and incurring high fees), I went to the front desk to pay, but expressed displeasure at the inconvenience and asked for a cash discount - something less than what they saved in credit card transaction fees so still more than what they would've gotten if I were paying with a credit card. At that point, the front desk said that they could swipe our credit card at another hotel. The fact that they did not mention this in the first place is not good service. And if I were a more cynical person, I would think that their credit card machine is broken all the time. The Picasso was a decent value for a last minute booking during high season, but the problems I encountered are not the kind that differentiates budget from luxury accommodations, but okay hotels from good hotels. For the problems I encountered, I wondered if I wouldn't have been better off at a true pension or nice hostel and paying less.
