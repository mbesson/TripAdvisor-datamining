There is no way this is a 4 star hotel. At best it is a 2 star. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. There is no elevator and the breakfast is not worth eating even if its free. Examples of all the problems:The entire staff was extremely rude and unprofessional. Our air conditioner never worked and made it impossible to sleep at night since its very hot in Rome during the summer. It was unbearable to stay inside the room. Unless you like sleeping in a sauna, dont expect to get a good nights sleep. We were promised 3 times that they would fix it, but each time they lied and said that it was fixed. No one would take responsibility and would blame the technician or other hotel staff. Also, the dirty shower and bathroom was horrible. Everytime we showered, the entire bathroom would flood within a couple minutes. We would have to use all our towels to keep the water from going into the main room. We called and asked for extra towels since all of ours were being used to stop the flooding into the room, and we were brought up dirty used towels, since they didn't have any clean ones. Like the air conditioner, the staff had promised us 3 times that this problem was corrected, but it was obvious that they didn't even look at it. There were several ants and bugs through out the room. On our first morning we were woken up to pounding construction noises from the building. We asked several times to be moved and the same words of \"Not Possible\" were told to us. The worst part was that we had accidently booked our last night with a separate reservation since we had decided to stay an extra night in Rome several days before our arrival. My wife had accidently made the last nights reservation for one night after our departure. We were called and harrased to pack our bags and to get out. I pleaded our case to them and said that our reservation was incorrectly made for the wrong night and begged them to move it forward one night. Their answer was, \"Not Possible\". He said to leave and come back the following night, even though we already had our flights to leave Rome. It was almost as if the front desk was happy to see us stuck in a bad situation. After a few minutes, we had the front desk person in or room, yelling and pushing us out of our room. My wife was changing clothes and he would not leave the room. They would not work with us to move our reservation and told us that we were left with no choices. I think that this was a huge blessing, because the Expedia rep was on the phone with me and she heard the harrasement over the phone and said no guest should be treated this way and refunded our incorrect reservation immediately. She also, mentioned that she was going to report this hotel to the appropriate Expedia department to have it removed. We moved down the street to an amazing real 4 star hotel, the Valadier, for almost the same price. I highly recommend this hotel. it was perfect and true pleasure. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!! or at any of their sister properties within the Relais Group Hotels. Ironically, we met another couple in Greece that had a similar experience at one of their other hotels. I never participate in sharing experinces online, but this was so bad that i felt obligated to report it and warn other potential visitors. Just read the other peoples reviews for confirmation.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff, clean, big enough and great location.\u201d", "Author": "mrabbs", "ReviewID": "UR73323979", "Content": "After a terrible experience in the Roman ghetto at a \"B&B\" and a horrible flight on Ryanair, this was such a great haven to arrive to. The location can't be beat and the staff was super courteous and helpfull. The rooms aren't huge but they're clean, cute and the shower is nice and hot. The breakfast on the roof was a great way to spend each morning. Considering food prices in Rome, this is a huge saver. It's not just a few muffins and pastries either, it's eggs, sausage, bacon, cheese, ham etc. etc. Just lovely.

When we first came to our room, 303, we found ants on the wall, on the floor and also in our bed. We went down to the reception and asked if we could change to another room because of the ants, but the hotel was fullbooked. The man in the reception was chocked about the ants and said \"No, impossible... someone must have been eating something there!\" We asked if we at least could have some spray that would kill the ants, and all we got was airfreshener. \" The man in the reception said to us that everything would be solved the next day so we could change to another room. We went upstairs, disgusted of the fact that the ants were crawling in our bed. Didn\u00b4t sleep so well that night. In the morning we were about to eat breakfast at the roof terrace and when we came to the buffet no staff was there and a pigeon was standing on the table, in one of the pies eating from it. We soon decided not to eat breakfast at the hotel, disgusted of what we just saw. We went down to the reception and asked for another room and told them about the pigeon upstairs, but there were still no other rooms available. We asked for some compensation for the inconvinience, but this was not possible as we already had paid in advance. \"There\u00b4s nothing we can do!\" they just said. Angry and dissapointed we left the hotel to go out on town, we had been in Italy for almost two weeks and Rome was our final destination before our journey home... so we wanted to book a nice, clean, fresh hotel... we thought that this ****-star hotel would be \"perfect\" but huh, it was everything but perfect.", "Date": "August 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBad Experience...\u201d", "Author": "worldtravellerLDN", "ReviewID": "UR71722500", "Content": "Really bad experience. Positive side: the hotel looks funky (although it is small and has no elevator) and is in a central location. Negative side: when things go wrong or break down, the hotel management gives no service and is unwilling to compensate in any way to make up for the problems. It left us with a really bad experience during what was meant to be a great holiday. We were not impressed. Details: On our first night we came back to the room from a day out, to get changed. When unlocking the door to our room, the key actually broke off in the lock. The hotel staff could not help so we had to wait for a while to get it sorted and access our room. Why not install electronic door keys if their regular keys actually break ? Then the airconditioning broke down over the weekend. We were told it would only be fixed on Monday, as no technicians would be called out on a Sunday... It was unbearably hot in the room. We asked the hotel to arrange alternative accommodation elsewhere, which they refused. We were two couples and some of us decided to stay and suffer the heat, others could not & had to check in to a nearby hotel for the night and pay 300 euros, to be able to get a good night's rest. The following morning we asked that they waive the cost of the room (we had just spent all that money, to resolve the hotel's airco problem!) and what does the hotel manager do ? She calls the police saying we don't want to pay for the room. Great service. We will never go back there !", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cHorrible experience!

While our booking indicated it was in the Piazza di Spagna, where the Spanish Steps are located, the hotel is actually closer to the Piazza del Popolo. Regardless, the hotel is a 2 minute walk to the Piazza del Popolo and a 5 minute walk to the Spanish Steps. Other sights, like the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon are also within a 15 minute walk. The Colosseum and the Roman Forum are a 30 minute walk, as is St. Peter's and the Vatican. Otherwise, we never had a problem finding a line to taxis in the Piazza del Popolo. The hotel itself is very small, and almost blends in with the street. The entrance is a small doorway along Via Babuino, and the lobby consists of a small front desk, two chairs, and a computer. The hotel has 4 floors of rooms, and the breakfast room is on the 4th floor in bad weather, or on the roof deck (another flight of stairs) in good weather. We always ate on the roof deck, which was very nice. There is no elevator. Our room was on the first floor, along a private hallway, which was nice because there was no noise from the stairway or other guests. The maid closet was right outside our room, and while we could hear her working, it was never a problem. We had absolutely NO view; our 3 windows looked into an air shaft. The windows provided enough light during the day, and while we were never promised a view, this was sort of dissapointing. I don't know what the other rooms offer, but I am sure rooms facing the street offer a view. The plus side of this was that our room was very quiet. Via Babuino is a busy street, and we never heard any outside noise. The room was actually very large for european standards. Our bed was two twins pushed together (typical for Europe) and was fairly comfortable. The sheets seemed worn, but always clean. There was also a decent sized closet and desk in the room. The bathroom has a large tub that looks rather old, but otherwise the bathroom was fine and very clean. We also had free wireless in our room, and it was fast and reliable. The staff were very friendly, and I have never met a housekeeper that works so hard! She was so polite, and very pleasant. The front desk staff were also very nice. When you leave the hotel, you give them your key (trust me, it is very heavy!) and they hand it back to you when you return. I think this ensures a little more security. The biggest downside was the breakfast. It was the worst of our trip. The buffet is small, consisting of very runny scrambled eggs, sad, fatty-looking bacon, and some assorted pastries and yogurts. We always found something to eat before heading out, but by the end of our trip we skipped breakfast and found something in one of the many cafes close by. I would stay here again for the neighborhood and location alone, but the hotel overall was very average.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Le Chateau Blanc", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d386898-Reviews-Le_Chateau_Blanc-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$66 - $334*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via del Babuino 35</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "386898", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/5a/1c/c6/le-chateau-blanc.jpg"}}
