I chose it because of it location - nearest metro station is just about 200 m and most of sights can be reached in 10-30 minutes by foot. But I\u2019m afraid that location is the best in this hotel. We stayed in first room, it was rather spacious but bathroom definitely should be renovated. And Wi-Fi didn\u2019t work in our room. You should be prepared to pay your stay one day before check-out - they have that strange rule. Staff was different - the man who met us in hotel was very friendly but I can\u2019t say it about other personnel. And the breakfasts where different too - first day it was rather good with cheese and ham, but the next day there were only croissant and some pastries. The other annoying thing was that they didn\u2019t give us keys from front door and every time when it was closed I had to use intercom. Then I lived in other hotel in the same building several years ago they gave me keys from all doors, and it was really convenient. So I can recommend this hotel only for short stays (2 or 3 nights), because of its location.

Very friendly staff, and hard-working. Nothing seemed to be too much trouble. - breakfast was great for a budget hotel. Negatives: - our room did not have its own AC, but the general AC of the hotel. This might have been fine, if the AC was working. The fact that it was 42c in the day in Rome, and high 30s at night while we were there, made the room very hot and sleep tough. They did provide a fan for us and apologized sincerely. - the power would shut off every hour or so. The desk employee would have to rush to the panel and flip the breaker on again. We got used to it, and even had a laugh or two at it, and would make a guessing game out of when the power would shut off. - the crazy lady on the bottom floor. The hotel shares the building with a few other hotels and businesses, so there is a general use lobby on the main floor. There is an older lady (who I think is some building manager of some sort), who yells at you if you linger for a minute or two.

But upon arrival at the Pichierri, we were told by the man on the front desk reception that we had been \"assigned\" to another hotel. I pointed out to him that we had in fact booked into and had a pre-paid voucher for the Pichierri, but he insisted that there was nothing he could do and that we had to go to their sister hotel, the Hotel Alius. Not an auspicious start. So we schlepped our suitcase from the Via Flavia over to the Via Nazionale to the Alius. Be warned - the hotel reception is on the third floor and to use the elevator you need a key, which you obviously won't have when you arrive. You need to ring the buzzer downstairs on the pavement to ask somebody to come down and fetch you. The elevator looks antedeluvian and bits of it were held together with masking tape - a warm welcome it ain't. And once we got to reception things did not improve. I have to say that I have never had a less friendly reception in my life. The woman on reception angry and surly when we arrived and stayed that way throughout our stay. My husband tried to get an explanation as to why we had been sent away from the hotel we booked but all she did was haul out a map and say \"this metro for the Colosseum, this metro for the Vatican\" as if that solved all problems. And she insisted on taking a photocopy of BOTH our passports - can somebody please explain why this intrusion is necessary when I have prepaid all accommodation costs, particularly when identity fraud is such a problem?? We were taken to room 7 and my first impression was that it was probably the most depressing and charmless hotel room I have ever been in. Granted, the room is large but for the rest you have bare tiled floors, the bare minimum of spartan furnishings (not even two chairs!), a mirror placed in the least convenient space by the door, and not even a picture on the wall. OK, so there was an en-suite bathroom and everything seemed clean - but threadbare: the curtains were no longer attached to all their hooks, there were cracks in the walls and our blanket had at least two cigarette burns in it. All the bulbs were energy saving bulbs that gave the room a blueish and depressing cast (except for the two halogen lights by the bathroom mirror - which didn't work!) The Lastminute.com description talks of a minibar, a safe and complimentary mineral water in each room - hahahaha! Don't hold your breath. No, actually DO hold your breath - especially when opening the bathroom door once it's been closed for a while. Although the bathroom was probably the best part of the room (clean and equipped with limited free soap and shampoo, plus a shower with good pressure), once the door had been closed for an hour or so - like every day after they cleaned it - it smelt overwhelmingly and nauseatingly of ancient drains. And, inexplicably, garlic. When we got home in the afternoons, we would first have to open the window and the bathroom door to get air circulating before it was safe to enter. Although the double glazing kept the traffic noise out, the room door was paper thin and you could hear every time a guest rang the buzzer to get in (door was locked after about 8pm). There was not a single English channel on the TV - not even CNN! And don't get me started on the breakfast. The breakfast room was a windowless cubbyhole on the way from the front desk to the rooms and the food verged on the inedible. There was cheap artficial fruit cordial, yucky coffee from a dispensing machine, yoghurts (the best thing there), crackers with jam and butter, and my personal favourites, \"7 day\" croissants in little individual foil packets (because, of course you want a croissant that's been hanging around for seven days!) made with margarine and coated in a sugary glaze. It was beyond awful and we did not return after the first day, despite breakfast being included in our rate. The only time we asked the receptionist anything (where to catch a no. 44 bus) they panicked, searched the internet for 10 minutes and could not come up with an answer. There was also a constant kerfuffle with the elevator. You needed a key to operate the elevator and you had to manually shut both the inner and outer doors for the car to move. Neither of these were spring-loaded, so if the customer before you had forgotten to pull the inner doors firmly shut when they disembarked, the car would be stranded. On the morning that we left (at 05h45) there was nobody at Reception and somebody had left the elevator doors open on the ground floor - so we had to haul ther27kg suitcase down six flights of stairs. So - what's the good news?! The beds/matresses were brand new and very comfortable (if you like a firm mattress as I do!) The location could not be better at the price. You are two blocks away from Repubblica metro station and a ten minute easy walk from Termini train station. Via Nazionale is a big throughfare for busses, so catching a bus home was never a problem. The area also felt safe at night, even very late (although Termini is to be avoided after dark!). When I opened my window, I looked across the road at the beautiful church of St Paul's Within the Walls which also had a fantastic carillion on Sunday. There is a Spar supermarket about three blocks along Via Nazionale (walking away from Repubblica) which is open until 9pm, even on Sunday. Avoid the Byron Bar on the corner of the block - they were more expensive than the place where we had a drink on the famously touristy Piazza Navona!! (And for bargain drinking, check out the early evening happy hours at the bars on the Campo dei Fiori.) Although I was very uhappy when we were first shown the room (and although I still object to being \"reassigned\" to a hotel I did not choose), by the end of the stay I had made peace with the shortcomings of the place. It's a 2-star hotel, so you need to go in with your eyes open, but let's face it - how much time are you planning to spend in your room - you're in Rome! If you want a romantic or luxury weekend, or if you are the type of traveller who likes to have a helpful concierge to help with bookings and directions and calling cabs, this is not for you. As a base for budget travel, it's OK. Just don't eat the breakfast or try to ask the staff anything!", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Awful\u201d", "Author": "jasminet", "ReviewID": "UR6571840", "Content": "My fiance and I had a terrible time at this hotel. there was a group of us there in two separate rooms - my sister and her husband and my fiance and myself. Along with one other couple, we seemed to be the only guests in the hotel. I know why now! For starters, it is dingy and depressing. Our bedroom had 3 beds in it - one double and two singles. The beds, and a cupboard were the only furniture. And the floors were tiled. So it felt like we were staying in a youth hostel and had no atmosphere, but that was the least of our problems. The toilet ran, constantly, even after we complained. The breakfast was absolutely disgusting. Coffee from an instant machine (so even worse than instant), and pre-packaged old dry toast. There was also jam and yoghurt and fruit cordial (completely undrinkable). It was just awful. The worst part of our stay was the very end. We organised a late checkout with the manager (who seemed very nice), as our flight didn't leave until 9 pm. Then just as we were leaving that morning to do the remainder of our site-seeing, the woman working behind the counter threw a tantrum and insisted the manager should not have let us have a late check-out, and that she didn't believe this had happened, and that there were more guests staying the following day (even though the manager had told us there weren't and we seemed to be the only guests in the hotel while we were there). She insisted we pack up our belongings and check out then and there. It was not a good stay. I don't know how it compares to other places in Rome in a similar price bracket but if that's all you get, I'd much rather save up and stay somewhere decent because staying in this place really put a dampner on our holiday.", "Date": "January 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morris, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "JulieAp", "ReviewID": "UR5906548", "Content": "Hotel Alius was a great deal for central Rome - a few blocks from the train station, and steps from Piazza della Repubblica. Unlike other hotels near the train station, this area was nice, clean and safe. Don't look too hard for the name of the hotel! The address brought us to a big wooden door with no name above it. We were a little confused at first, but we quickly found a buzzer for Hotel Alius. The man at reception came right down and directed us to the third floor. Apparently, different hotels operate on different floors of this building Our room was small, clean, and very simply furnished with new furniture. It was nothing fancy, but we were comfortable here. The staff was very helpful and curteous. Our room was located right off of the breakfast area, so it was noisy in the morning. The continental breakfast was only fair.

Quite scary - felt like prison cell. Asked for another room, they gave us another room - quite good at first sight. But then the problems started: the A/C was at max speed maintaining 16 Celsius degrees constantly. We told them about the problem, they told us will fix it the next day - so we slept in 16 degrees temp (no way to turn it off, could not even unplug it). The next day - the unpleasant surprise to see that nothing was fixed (beside A/C, TV had only one station and two light bulbs were not functional). The indian guy suddenly didn't talk English no more. Talked to the manager who told us it's our travel agency's fault and hung the phone (?!?! - like they could knew they can't have proper A/C). The same promise - will fix it the next day. The third and the last day it was too much - we faced the same ignorance and so we slept 3 nights in a room with practically unstoppable A/C, broken TV and half of the lights in the room working. And of course the breakfast which could hardly be called breakfast. Of course, if you just dump the croissant, yogurt, butter and jam in your stomach, you could feel full up.
