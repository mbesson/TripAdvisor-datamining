The room had blackout curtains, iron/board, and a refrigerator. It also had a safe, but I could not get it to close....not sure if it was only a problem in my room or if they are all nonworking. I did not use the wifi, but the computer in the lobby seemed to have issues. The breakfast was typical (toast/cereal/sausage/coffee/juice) but eating on the roof was very pleasant, especially for those who smoke. The area outside the hotel was occupied by a few homeless/panhandlers, they rarely approached me, as them seemed more interested in the people struck in traffic as the motorists attempted to get on the highway on ramp. The location was three blocks to shopping/restaurtants/beach, and seemed relatively safe as the nearby restaurants were open until after midnight and there was usually people around.

I found the hotel to be clean and good enough for my short stay. I booked a triple room ( 2 adults + child) and found that the full size bed was a bit small for 2 adults. We ended up beeing just two so we had our own bed (full size + single). The room had a TV, coffee maker (coffee + tea bags), iron, ironing board and a small refrigerator. The bathroom was small but clean and there were shampoo, conditioner and soap. The breakfast was on the roof top of the hotel and was very good. They had boiled eggs, sausage, cereals, pastries,bread, juices, coffee and milk. You could eat as much as you wanted so for me that was a good deal as it was complimentary. At most hotels a regular breakfast fare is around $15. We ordered pizza from the restaurant adjacent to the hotel and it was very good. We spent the day at the mall so we had a light dinner there before heading back to the hotel. The lobby has a vending machine where you can purchase sodas and water. All in all we had a good stay at this hotel. The staff was helpful with any questions that we had. We met a lot of people going on cruises so I think this hotel is popular with cruisers.

One big asset in the hotel is the rooftop breakfast bar, where you can eat a good breakfast and get great views of the Condado coast and its various landmark buildings. There is a particularly impressive art-deco style high-rise next door.The staff sometimes work solo or in pairs and may need reminding to wipe tables or replenish coffee at busy times, but they are efficient when they do. The pizza restaurant attached to the hotel on the ground floor gives friendly service in a 'vibrant' atmosphere, which means lots of locals enjoying loud conversation. The hotel is five minutes walk from the west end of Condado beach, along which you can walk in either direction and find somewhere to lie in the sun or swim, tho the power of the waves was rather offputting for the latter during our stay. It is a pleasant walk westwards(anti-clockwise from the hotel) over the causeway and back along the lagoon... the hotel has very good free maps of the area and of Old San Juan. As the hotel has the airport to the east and Old San Juan and the cruise piers to the west, it is a great location for onward travellers.

However, the rooms were smelly/musty and very cold (for a Caribbean location). We turned the a/c off and the place was still too cold. The place seemed to be understaffed as well because the guy who took care of the breakfast was also the porter (on duty). This guy's attitude sucked! Although there was a language difference, there is nothing wrong with a smile and a pleasant outlook (this translates in any language). Check out is also horrible (we were in a large group (26) persons and we were asked to bring luggage to the lobby by 11:30 am our flight was 5:50 pm) Imagine 26 persons by maybe 3 pieces each in a small lobby with no seating arrangement or storage facility. It was horrible. The attitude of some of the staff members was totally disgusting. I would not recommend this hotel to any of my friends. There are nicer, friendlier places to stay in PR. (Because our group was big we did not have much of a choice - we were told).", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cStay Away!

When traveling through Mexico by car, I stayed in $10 per night hotels that were clean, with running water, and had a shower that drained. El Portal is a $100 per night Roach Motel! I made a reservation to stay at El Portal because I thought there was nothing else, but several friends of mine were able to get far better hotels for a much better price. Warning: Do not stay here, even if there is nowhere else to stay. Camp out if necessary. There are hundreds of hotels that are far better and cheaper. The staff was nice, but the hotel is a dump! The shower had no water pressure and the temperature changed from cold to superhot wihtout any warning. The shower did not drain and no amount of complaints can correct that, i'ts a plumbing issue. It was a complete nightmare.
