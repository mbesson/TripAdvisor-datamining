{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hotel Schiphol A4 only 10 Minutes away from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. We picked this Hotel from the reviews we had read on Tripadvisor and the fact that it was so close to Schiphol Airport as my husband is a very keen Aircraft Spotter .The Hotel was excellent with its free shuttle service to and from the Airport which started its first run to the airport at 6.00am .The Hotel is located along the motorway A4 , only 10 minutes away from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, between Amsterdam and The Hague.Aircraft can been seen flying over the Hotel . This makes a great base for any plane spotters who like to be away from the busy built up areas around most airports, as this Hotel is set back in farm land. There is a Motorway service area across the road from the hotel which has a large choice of menu's if you don't wish to eat in the hotel, we had half a Chicken and chips for 8.95 euro's each.We stayed for two nights and had an excellent clean large room , the bathroom had both shower and bath with towels replaced every day. The Breakfast was outstanding, with so much choice , I would find it hard to think that anyone could not find something to eat there. It is worth paying for the Breakfast to be included in your booking. Great Value and you can help yourself to as much as you want.We hope to return to Amsterdam again, as sadly it rained all the three days we had there, which didn't help when my husband wanted to take Aircraft photo's at Schiphol. It was our first time in Amsterdam but we will return and top of our list is to stay at the Schiphol A4 again.", "Date": "Dec 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR849425167", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nzspotter"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1225591-r22789808-Schiphol_A4_Hotel-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "HotelID": "1225591", "Price": "\" id=\"hotel_1225591\">"}}
