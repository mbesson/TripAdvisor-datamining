We absolutely loved it! This was our fourth time in Venice so we decided to try a different hotel and were not disappointed. It is a bit further from the Rialto Bridge than we usually stay but it was an easy walk to the Rialto and then St. Mark's Square. It was really nice to stay in a new area as we explored new streets and canals. There are a lot of great shops in the area as well as several groceries stores. We had a family room for 4 people. It was a good sized room with lots of charm and with a large bathroom. It was very clean and very well kept. I think this hotel had the most comfortable beds of the whole trip...beware that beds in Italy are hard!! The room was very quiet and had good air conditioning which is important in Venice as you don't really get any breezes from the windows. The breakfast in the morning was really good and was served from about 7:30 until 10:00 am. The first morning we were at the hotel, we had flown from Canada to Rome and then driven about 6 hours to get to Venice. I thought we would wake up in the morning with no problems but we all slept in. The lady in the breakfast room called us at 10:00 to see if we were coming. I told her that we had all slept in and not to worry about it but she wouldn't hear of it, and she held breakfast for us until 10:30 so we could eat. The roof balcony was a real treat! It is fairly small so only 1 group at a time can really use it but we always found we could use it with no problem. It is nice to buy a bottle of wine and sit up there enjoying the views of the roof tops which are unique to Venice! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful! We took the vaporetto in and found the directions to the hotel were fairly good and we only had to ask for help 1 time. We walked out as it is an easy 10 minute walk out of Venice. Being that we were in Venice with kids, we didn't eat in any restaurants as they are on the pricey side but a highlight for us was stopping to get pizza and then sitting behind the fish market along the grand canal eating our pizza and watching the boats go by! There is a great little takeout pizza place about halfway between the hotel and the fish market on the left hand side that had some of the best pizza we had in all of Italy!

Booked through booking.com at ~\u00c2\u00a3130/night. Let's get one thing clear, where space comes at a premium, staying on the actual island of Venice is not cheap. We chose this hotel due to reading reviews and was one of the cheaper 3-star hotels we could find available. The hotel is in a great location, about 10-15 minutes walk from Venice Santa Lucia station and 5-10 from the Rialto Bridge; it is well signposted so it's not too hard to find. The staff on the front desk were very friendly, welcoming and spoke decent English. Be warned that the hotel does not have a lift so if you intend to bring lots of heavy bags/suitcases, you will need to be prepared to lug them up a couple of flights of stairs. Our room was clean, of a good size and had lots of character: wooden beams in the ceilings as well as long red curtains. It was a decent size with one double bed and another collapsable double bed. We were not sure if this was meant to be a double or quadruple room. Whilst the standard double was comfortable, the fold-up one was not with a thin mattress, through which you could feel the supporting wooden slats; this allowed for an uncomfortable nights' sleep. The room had a small LCD TV, fridge, air-conditioning (the unit sat on the ground) and a safe. The bathroom was a good size and included a shower, bidet, sink and toilet. The continental breakfast had a disappointing selection of fruit, yogurts and cereal. In addition their conveyor-belt toaster was the slowest I had ever came across (it would take several passes to toast the bread sufficiently) and they supplied rather small pieces of bread to go with it. On the plus side the pastries offered were good.

Simply because we would be leaving before breakfast was set up. The hotel has free wireless, which seems to be a novelty in Europe. The room was wonderful, air-conditioned, and quiet. The neighborhood is conveniently located between Rialto and St. Mary of the Friar's Church, but the hotel is tucked just off a main street so it is quite private and quiet.

I would rate this hotel as the best hotel of our stay!!! First, the location is perfect. The *water\" taxi drops you literally 5 mins *walk* away from the hotel. So to those travelers who maybe traveling with heavy luggage, you won't find urself dragging ur suitcases for a long ride. Secondly, even though Venice is a relatively small island, the location of this hotel is pretty cool. For shoppers, some very interesting stores & boutiques are located just around the hotel. Infact lots of restaurants there too. Didn't matter what hour of the day/night it was, there's constant traffic by the hotel. Never gets too loud but its just nice to see people strolling by at all hours. If you're traveling by urself or if you're only girls traveling, ull feel safe at all times. However, the BEST part of this hotel is the service -- the hotel manager, the gentleman, he's the NICEST guy on Earth, no kidding!! He made our Venice trip thousand times better. Everyday he put a smile on our face. We're the type of travelers who barely spend time in our hotels - for most of the day and night, we would be in the city, we'd only come to the hotel to sleep. And even then he managed to put a smile on our faces!!! The breakfast is superb! 2nd day we barely made it - only 10 mins left and even then, so many pastries and breads and other items were still there on the breakfast table. in fact the lady who was working the kitchen began to load fresh food items as soon as she spotted us in the room even tho we were late! I thought that calls for a brilliant service. Whatever you do, please remember to enjoy the roof of this hotel. On our 2nd night, we picked up some pizza and drinks at a random restaurant and ate our dinner on the roof of this hotel. There are tables and chairs up there even pool benches for you to get your tan (no pool tho!) It was so peaceful and relaxing - you get to see the full view of Venice - roofs of all buildings - if u get lucky, ull catch a glimpse of the locals sitting in their balconies enjoying the evenings of Venice!! Make sure you visit the St. Marks square at night - there are many mini concerts playing there at night and you'll thoroughly enjoy the experience. The gondola rides are pricey - 80 euros but tell the driver you can only afford 20 euros per person. We did that - we were 2 people - the driver was nice enough to find us another couple to split the overall ticket with so we each paid 20 euros for the ride!
