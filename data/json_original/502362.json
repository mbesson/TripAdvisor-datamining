We had a double room with 2 single beds. The room was very dirty you could find hair from serveral people you stayed there before everywhere! The blanket was dirty aswell. It was noisy at night because you could hear airplanes starting/arriving and the air conditioning system was very loud. We could also hear the noise from the street above the hotel. The breakfast was horrible. The bread was already dry and old the the rest of the buffet. Of course it depends on the time when you\u00c2\u00b4re having breakfast we varied from very early to late. One time we were lucky and the breakfast was ok but nothing special. We we\u00c2\u00b4re just in the Hotel to sleep so it was okay but we will definately not come back to this hotel! But Istanbul was fantastic its magical while Ramadan! I wanna go back to Istanbul very soon!", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tehran, Iran", "Title": "\u201cGood, dont expect something special\u201d", "Author": "Eli F", "ReviewID": "UR117724480", "Content": "Great city view on the roof! good for bed and breakfast.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGood Not Great\u201d", "Author": "summerpopsicle", "ReviewID": "UR115611747", "Content": "Breakfast good - some variety, location Great very near Metro, and shops and banks and restaurants.

First experience was not pleasant - shoved 3 beds into average sized room so very crowded! Hotel staff mean and not accomodating! On way back different staff super nice and broke our rooms into 2 for same price.

The room was clean everyday, except the toilette (I don't know why!). Staff was ok, not special as all the turkish people, but ok...there is a promotion: staying there more of 4 days you get the transfer from airport to hotel for free. We payed about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18,00 for persons for a double (triple!) room...but i don't know if it was made by a problem of the website booking.com (also the guy of the reception told us that normally the price is the double!). The hotel is quite far from the center, but there is the tram line just in the street in front of the hotel that goes directily to the center. Findikzade infact is about 5 stops from Sultanhamet. Anyway it's quite far from Taksim (the best place for the life of the night). The good thing is that it's not a turistic place and prices and life is originally turkish!", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreen Anka substandard\u201d", "Author": "Westerner64", "ReviewID": "UR21333041", "Content": "The Green Anka is poorly located in Istanbul requiring a long tram ride to the major tourist attractions in Istanbul.

The tour company booked our tour group here unexpectedly - perhaps to cut corners and keep the company's expenses low. We had been in a 3-4 star hotel in Taksim the previous 2 days. From the outset, the Green Anka Hotel felt like a low-budget joint. Small uninviting lobby, smallish lift, steep spiral staircase. Entrance to hotel opened to a very narrow street. One had to be careful of suddenly emerging traffic.. Location was close to Findikzade tram station - convenient to get to Sultanamet and Eminonu. Room was small and needed a new coat of paint and refurbishing. We were served by waiters at the dining room as part of the deal.
