We were lured to the Days Inn due to the low price (about $60 including tax), free airport shuttle, and included breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The airport shuttle was fast and frequent. The van was aged but clean and the driver very friendly. Check-in took only a few seconds and the staff was very courteous. Upon arrival at the room we were greeted by dated decor but the room, including the bathroom, was cleaner than the last two Hilton's I stayed at. The mattresses were old and springy but comfortable enough for a good night's sleep. The in-room coffee maker was much appreciated. The room had a weird layout where the sink and bathroom counter were in the main part of the room and offered no degree of privacy. The bathroom had a full sized tub and toilet but no place to put anything. With the bathroom door closed there was barely enough room to change clothes. This is not a hotel room where you would want to spend any amount of time in but we were there only to sleep and it worked out perfectly for our needs. Climate control, television, and coffee maker all worked great. The free wi-fi worked well on my daughter's i-touch but it would not work on my PDA. After examining their network I traced it down to having multiple routers with the same broadcast ID which doesn't always work well with older handheld devices. The included breakfast included cereal, muffins, toast, and waffles. There was no protein (eggs, meat etc) or fruit. There was Sunny Delight but no real juice available. If you are into a big hearty breakfast, don't expect to get it here. There is no such thing as a free meal. The included breakfast was on par with the price of the hotel so there were no complaints. This hotel was only a few minutes from the Seattle Airport. There were a lot of restaurants and a small casino within short walking distance of the hotel. Everything from fast food to fine dining was available. A 7-11 was two doors down. The location was very convenient. The business center consisted of one computer in the lobby of the hotel. A teenager was monopolizing it when I wanted to print out my boarding pass and the front desk clerk offered to kick him off for me, but I did it myself. Being that there was only one computer available a policy against wasting time on teen sites would be a good idea since most guests aren't as assertive as I can be and might be inclined to wait politely instead of taking charge of the situation. When we returned to the Days Inn about a week later on the way back from our vacation the hotel staff remembered and welcomed us. This hotel was an excellent value and lived up to all it promised plus more.

We waited about 15 minutes and they were there. The driver loaded all luggage for us and then unloaded onto a luggage cart at the hotel, which was very helpful because I was alone with two small children. Check in was a breeze. The room was very clean and spacious. We had a room with just one queen size bed, but they obviously could have fit another in the room, so it gave the room a very open feel. The continental breakfast in the morning, which is included with room, was very good. They even had a waffle station where you could make your own belgian waffles. No problems checking out. The shuttle back to the airport leaves every half hour, and we were the only ones waiting for the time that we left, so there was plenty of space.

On close inspection things were dated, but it didn't jump out at you. The bathroom was small. The service at this place was absolutely terrible. Our TV didn't work when we arrived, and when we called the front desk they immediately made it clear this was more our problem than theirs. It took numerous phone calls and 6 hours to get the TV fixed. No one would take responsibility for this problem; someone else was always \"on the way up\" to fix it. The breakfast went until 9:30 AM. When we showed up at 9:20 AM everything was gone. We asked them to restock a few things, which they did... but very slowly and very grudgingly. The did not seem concerned about or interested in our plight (9 adults and 3 kids without food). They were also clearly understaffed, which explains why they were so slow. The location is convenient to the airport, but not to downtown, especially with traffic - 45 minutes each way. There is free internet in the lobby, but no printer attached (can't print out boarding passes), which seems inexcusable to me for a hotel at the airport with a free airport shuttle. On the plus side: we paid $51 for a room for 4 adults, there is a free breakfast, and there is a free shuttle. Summary: I might stay here again for a dirt-cheap place to crash before an early morning (or after a late night) flight, but would choose a different place if I were going to stay for more than a few hours.", "Date": "July 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Schiller Park, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cClose to airport reasonably priced GREAT DEAL\u201d", "Author": "drw2112", "ReviewID": "UR2588234", "Content": "We were only staying one night in Seattle and wanted to catch a Mariners game.
