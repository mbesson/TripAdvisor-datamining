I presented him my voucher and he asked me to wait till as it was very early. I agreed. At 10.30 am, I went to him and asked him, how long more I have to wait..... and he told me, \" did u hear the tok, tok noise?\" I said No, why?, oh there is some renovation happening, and no water in the rooms, and dont worry, I have a better hotel for you, it is 4 star, just opposite, and very good breakfast and I will transfer you immediately.... And he transferred me to The Washington Hotel...... It all happened so fast, I had no time to argue.... I was also very tired, and wanted to visit the toilet and hit the bed ! On reaching the Washington, I found out it was 3 star not 4, an old property, musty rooms, small rooms, stained carpets - all black and brown, a very tiny toilet with a faucet that was difficult to use, and the coldest breakfast I every ate..... ice cold omlettes, salads, bread and everything else. We were only there for a night, so didnt want to argue, but I felt this was totally unfair. We spend a lot of time trying to go through reviews, choose a hotel of our liking, and then to finally be dumped in a totally strange place which I am forced to stay in is unwaranted and uncalled for ! Thank god the location was the same, and there were nice places around to eat, but the Barin Hotel should think twice before dumping confirmed guests elsewhere.
