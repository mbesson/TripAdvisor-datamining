The location was great and very convenient. The rooms were a bit small but I only went there to sleep as there is so much to see around. I wish I was there more than 2 nights.... I was treated very well from the staff. The room was very clean. I loved Spain in overall and there was not much to complain. Rather there was nothing to complain at all. I loved my stay for two nights at the hotel. There were lots of places to eat around the hotel. The breakfast place next door was awesome and you could walk out at 2am in the morning and still feel very safe around. Location was great and the atmosphere was awesome. I would definitely go and stay there again and again and again", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "houston", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "HoustonAnthony", "ReviewID": "UR21681529", "Content": "This is the third time we have booked our reservation at this great location hotel! We love the accomodations. The staff is friendly and best of all they do remember frequent visitors. The breakfast is adequate but if you are nice to them they do go out of their way to make a great meal for you, they really will! We have recommended this hotel to all of our friends that have made their way to Madrid and they have loved the accomodations. Great location, the rooms are clean, sure the streets are a little noisy, ask for an inside room. This is a terrific establishment. We highly recommend this Hotel, and we will make reservations here again.", "Date": "November 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "austria", "Title": "\u201cHorrendous!\u201d", "Author": "lorero", "ReviewID": "UR3528281", "Content": "I live in Europe and a friend informed me she would be in Madrid about a week, so I looked for a hotel that would accomodate our budgets. I found the Hotel Paris by the Internet, and got what I believed to be a good deal. The pluses: very central location: in the heart of the city, and within 2 or 4 kilometers of countless atractions. The minuses: The staff is impolite and at times disrecpetful, the room was old, the bed was smelly and the mattress was the worst I have ever seen (and I have stayed, for instance, in small hostals in South America), and since we had the \"discount\" weekly rate, the room was not cleaned the entire time we were there. I would have appreciated it if at least it had been clean when we arrived. It was not. We did get one clean (I hope) small and old towel each, and these towels no longer could even absorb water so we requested extra ones. The included breakfast consisted of 1 type of bread, 2 types of rolls, tea, coffee, and the most acidic orange juice (I still wince when I remember it). My companion requested a single slice of cheese each day to go with the bread, and the waiter did bring this wihtout a fuss. The sound insulation between rooms is nonexistent, to the extent that you can hear not just your neighbors, but also several rooms in each direction. Anytime you were in the room, for instance, for sleep, you could hear the full assortment of sounds a big citiy has to offer: honking, screeching, crashing, shouting, bottles breaking, screaming, etc etc, even it you had the window shut. Upon checking out, we had an extra 63 Euro (plus tax) included with the bill. I asked what was being paid for, and was informed that the \"extra towel\" fee was 5 Euro per day (we had not been informed of that before), and that we had spent 4 Euro each breakfast beyond what was included. When I tried to politely explain that a) we were led to believe that the single (and rather thin) slice of cheese was understood to be free, and b) that even if we did have to pay, that 4 Euro for 5 grams of cheese came out to 800 Euro per kilo, the man at the desk called over the staff and had them surround us to try to intimidate us. I did the math, and offered to split the difference just to get out of that dump. The man accepted and even had the gall to say that as I could see, customer service was the number one priority this hotel and that he expected me to recommend it to all my friends. In all, we had one noisy week with horrendous service, a depressing room, and awful breakfast (complete with the most expensive cheese in Madrid or anywhere), and....oh please, just stay somewhere else! Subsequently, I have been able to find other hotels in Madrid for the same cost or less, so if you are reading this I urge you to keep looking. This hotel is not the one for you!", "Date": "June 4, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cI'm staying there again this June (2005)\u201d", "Author": "Debbie1153", "ReviewID": "UR2998737", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel Paris when I was part of and Elderhostel tour package (I'm 51).

The breakfast was your typical European hotel fare and the lobby is a bit too dark for my taste, but overall this hotel is a charming place for those on a budget.
