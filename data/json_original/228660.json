I paid about 60E/night for a single room. I was given a room on the 4th floor, facing the elevator hall, so I thought I would hear people going in and coming out of the elevators; it turned out the room noise insulation was quite good, also traffic noise from the adjacent road was barely audible. The room itself was spacious, comfortable and well kept, with a nice and clean bathroom. The free WiFi (call reception to get the password) worked just fine. A thing I really appreciated was the free water bottles in the fridge, replenished daily, which I found very handy to bring along with me for the day.

As 4* hotels go, it was fine. The room was nice, comfortable and a decent size. There was free internet in the lobby. The problem we had was that our room was absolutely boiling hot and there seemed to be no way for us to control the heating ourselves. As a result, we were forced to have our windows wide open at all times, which was very noisy as the hotel is situated on a busy road. In terms of location, I wouldn't recommend this hotel for tourists. Although it is only a 5-10 minute walk from a metro station, it is in the north of Madrid and the metro ride to get into the centre is fairly long. The area is quite characterless and there's not much around so you wouldn't want to spend much time there. Overall, we think there are better options, closer to the city centre, within the same price range, and we would recommend these before recommending this hotel.

The basic building is the same- big concrete building with some attempted design elements. The rooms were smaller but they had a great, no phenomenal view of a downtown area. Nearby metro is Pio XII and it is a little walk. The bathroom was decent though smaller than the Alcala Norte but it too has its own remote feeling. What was disappointing was the front desk staff. Here they seemed clueless and not trained in how to work in the service industry. I asked a young lady if she knew where an address was on the same street. She just old me to go outside and keep walking to the right. Dismissive and rude, but worse, she was wrong. The address was actually in the other direction and RIGHT IN FRONT of the hotel. I brought this to her attention and she was not apologetic, she did not even care. This was not the only snafu- I asked for a taxi once and it never came and when I brought it to their attention, they again said, \"well walk and find one\". I stayed here for four days and do not recommend this hotel. Only one tall man works here and he is always taking care of everything. Sadly the female staff is useless and not trained to work in hotels.

The hotel does securely look after you baggage in case you have a late flight home again you can get to the airport direct from the nearest metro about 6 stops or a direct taxi to the hotel about 25-30 euro. all in all a good base for a quick break in Madrid but would probably find a closer downtown hotel next time", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel with value for money, convenient for Chamartin station\u201d", "Author": "KathleenFrances", "ReviewID": "UR78925640", "Content": "The hotel was easy to walk to from the metro station (Duque de Pastrana) which was only ~20 minutes on the metro from Barajas airport.

The reception staff were very friendly, efficient and spoke very good English. There was free Wi-Fi in the hotel and also two computers available in reception to use the internet for free. The decor and furniture in the room was modern and in good condition, and also very clean. There was a little fridge in the room with free bottles of water and was big enough for us to keep our picnic food in. The room was a good size and the bathroom larger than expected.

The only thing that put a dampener on things was that I fell victim to a pick pocketer (make sure you wear your rucksack on your chest rather than your back as that is a dead give away that you are a tourist). The police were excellent in furnishing me with the telephone numbers for my credit cards (apparently this is a common occurance in this part of the city).
