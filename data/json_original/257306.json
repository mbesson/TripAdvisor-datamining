The property had lost the email sent to them by Wotif confirming the booking. Luckily I had called in advance to reserve a parking space and discovered the problem. 2. The actual location of the room was in a different building to that given on the website (about 300 metres away). 3. The parking was in aother different location and was very shoddy to say the least and it was difficult to get a space even though it had been reserved. 4. The room was tiny. 5. No room service, no restaurant, no minibar. Now the good points ... 1. The young staff members were polite and helpful. 2. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. 3. The position, even thought it was on Parramatta Road (rather than the advertised Missenden Road) was in walking distance to King Street, Newtown - which was our reason for selecting this property. There is a lack of good quality accommodation in the Camperdown-Newtown area.

On arrival, we were greeted by a polite young man on the front desk who did his best to make up for the poorly maintained reception area. The next issue I encountered was the one and only lift which was used by both guests and housekeeping. It was not unusual to wait up to 7 minutes for the lift as housekeeping prop the lift doors open to load it up with their rubbish and dirty bedlinen & towels. Once we entered the room, I was revolted by the sight of the lounges which appeared to have been aquired from the 2nd hand furniture store. Secondly, the kitchen was so filthy and housekeeping left us the used and dirty dish sponge from the previous guests. The dishes and cutlery still had food stains visible and I even found hair in the bowls. The oven was filthy and looks like its hasn't been cleaned out in a few years and that also goes for the frying pan. All in all, you wouldn't trust eating with the filthy cutlery & crockery provided. My husband and I took matters into our own hands and purchased a new dish washing sponge, cleaning products & frying pan. When trying to clean the oven, I discovered that it doesn't work! Shouldn't be a surprise, right? Lucky we purchased a frying pan, what we didn't fry, we grilled and when we couldn't be bothered looking at the kitchen, we went out to eat. Housekeeping..... where do I start! It was an effort to get our towels changed for a clean set every second day and it took me two complaints on our 6th day of stay to have our bedlinen changed. When housekeeping finally arrived at our room, the housekeeper asked me \"do you really want it done?\" I couldn't believe she was asking me that question. She then had the ordacity to huff and puff and make a big deal out of having to do her job! Well, it is now day 10 and the bathroom & toilet hasn't been cleaned once, never mind, I did it myself yesterday. Housekeeping is to busy to do the job required because she is too busy gossiping about the other guests! She also complained to me about Australians and how lazy they are & that foreigners had to come to this country to do all the work..... hmmmmm. Unfortunately I didn't make the booking and it had been paid for in advance by my company. I provided my feedback to them only a few days ago to ensure that no future bookings are made with Quest Camperdown & I have also filed a complaint with Quest Head Office but noting the complaints already filed on this website, I highly doubt that any improvements will be made. Ps, my husband hates this place - it has no foxtel!!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cDirty and poorly maintained\u201d", "Author": "Mo0o0o", "ReviewID": "UR121787894", "Content": "Handy location for the RPA hospital, however this accommodation is unfortunately dirty and poorly maintained (windows covered in dust/tar from the road, kitchen floor was sticky and carpets/soft chairs that needed a good clean and part of the bathroom ceiling was hanging off precariously). Beds were comfortable but this accommodation is certainly not worthy of the rates. The larger apartments on higher floors did seem cleaner and brighter. Maintenance requests were not carried out (bedside lights not working and a panel hanging from the ceiling of the bathroom). Unfortunately there is only one lift to take residents to all 5 floors, and this was out of order at times and often in use by cleaning staff/maintenance who don't seem to give a second thought to holding up the visitors whilst they stop the lift to load it full of garbage whilst you wait. Reception desk is often closed. Facilities were practical, if in need of maintenance. Cooking was a potentially expensive: smoke-detectors are positioned over directly over the smokey old stove along with signs saying that $700 fine payable by the guest if alarms sound. Charges were made to my credit card without informing me of this. Receptionists were generally polite but unhelpful. I will not be visiting Quest again.

We reserved a Studio apartment which had everything in it that we wanted. It was very clean, stylishly decorated and very quiet - our apartment faced the laneway to the left of the building as you were facing it from Missendon Road. The staff were very friendly and helpful and check in/check out was easy. We parked our car in the secure underground car park accessed from the laneway - we reserved the car park in advance as there aren't many of them and there is an additional charge for this. Our Studio Apartment had a very comfortable Queen sized bed (very nice quality linens on the bed too), table and chairs, flat screen TV and other techno equipment which we didn't use, good size built in wardrobe and a very spacious bathroom in soothing colours with good quality towels. There was also a balcony which we didn't use but it was great if you like to sleep with fresh air coming into the room. Opposite the bed was a \"kitchenette\" complete with all the cutlery, plates and cooking utensils that you could want particularly for a short term stay, microwave and a minbar. There was no stove or cooktop or kitchen sink, but given that we had a studio, that didn't really surprise us nor bother us as we didn't plan to cook anything. While we could pay extra for an internet connection in our apartment, there is one free internet station in the lobby which is available when staff are on duty (early morning til late at night). Free local newspapers and various tourist brochures are available from the lobby while a daily Sydney paper is delivered to your door in the morning free of charge - a bonus extra which we were didn't expect but were glad to have. The location was great - just a couple of minutes walk to the hospital and other nearby medical facilities. There is a supermarket a minute or two away if you want to buy a few food items - I didn't because like other guests we brought a few of our own food items so we didn't have to spend time shopping. The other thing is that there is a pub which serves great meals for around $10-12 very close by as well as several cafes - all around the $10 price range for Thai for example, and if you really must, Maccas opposite RPA. However there are a ton of cheap eats in King St Newtown if you want to venture a further 5-10 mins up Missendon Road. Transport into the city from The Quest is very easy. Simply head to the left out of The Quest, cross over Parramatta Road, buy a bus ticket from the newsagent and wait for a bus - there is a pretty regular service during weekdays and it takes about 10 mins or so (depending on taffic conditions) to get to Town Hall in the city. I'd definitely stay here again....but my tip would be to book early as this is good quality establishment close to RPA which can be booked out due to its popularity with guests.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cComfortable, nothing special.\u201d", "Author": "rscoro", "ReviewID": "UR67408121", "Content": "Stayed here for an extended period of time (2 weeks) in a 1 bedroom apartment.

The rooms are well sized, and come with Aircon, and a proper kitchen. I didn't really find the noise an issue, but be aware that you are booking on Missenden Rd, which is a pretty busy street. A couple of issues: 1. Internet was expensive. In this day and age, I can't believe anyone can get away with charging AUD$25 for 24 hrs of internet (and it was slow too). 2. Breakfast - there is no restaurant (it's an apartment of course) and they place that they allow chargebacks to doesn't open until 7:30am and not at all on Sundays. This may be fine for some, but be aware. 3. Breakfast packs, containing a small box of cornflakes, UHT milk, Golburn valley fruit pottle and some biscuits are AUD$9!
