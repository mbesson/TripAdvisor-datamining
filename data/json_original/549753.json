The staff is very courtious and polite. The price of the rooms are perfect. Both times I have requested rooms on the bottom floor that ajoin and never had an issue. I like the fact that the pool is seperate from the rooms, it helps keep the noise down. The rooms are clean and well maintained. From now on when we visit this will be our hotel. I have read where some people complain about the breakfast or other little things. There are always negative people who like to grip, and if I have a major issue then I would address it with the hotel staff but I have never found a reason to complain.

We had their continental breakfast the first morning, as we had an early booking for the Titanic Museum. The biscuits were kind of hard, almost like they didn't rise enough. The gravy was on the watery side. The doughnuts were good though. We went to the Titanic, and spent 3 hours there. We went back to the motel to warm up our Famous Dave's leftovers from the night before for lunch. The room had not been made up, but the maid was next door, so we changed into swimsuits and went to the pool to give her time to make up the room. We could see the room from the pool. We stayed in the pool an hour, then sat in the sun to dry off, and she still hadn't done our room. She must've gone to lunch, so we went back to eat. She came while we were eating and just emptied the trash. So we never got the bed made up or clean towels. No biggie, but if we had had friends with us that had stopped by, it would have looked bad. The room was comfortable, with two comfortable chairs to sit in while perusing brochures. When we checked in, there were lots of brochures and maps in the lobby and a list to order by phone from our room. The tickets were delivered to the lobby later that day.

Yes, it was clean (you should expect that any place). Yes, the front desk was cordial. All in all, OK for a night or two. My room was $57 which is an excellent price -- of course, it was early December. So, a good value for a decent room, but certainly doesn't come even close to being the best hotel I've ever stayed at. There is a small, attractive lobby in the front and a tiny breakfast room with 5 small tables and 4 more tables are in the lobby area. Don't count on getting a seat if all the 98 rooms are booked. The breakfast is really basic. The \"baked daily\" donuts were boxed from the grocery store. Two cereals, biscuits/gravy, toast/bagels, so-so orange juice. The fresh fruit was one large bowl with small cubes of pears and mangoes (I think). The small swimming pool was reasonably warm but the building is not heated. If the hotel was fully booked, it could be very crowded. The tub/shower was actually better than in some big-chain hotels --- two grab bars and the floor textured to prevent slipping.

The gentleman at the front desk offered us a coupon for the reasturant just around the corner. $3.99 for a full buffet, so they offered us a great continental breakfast and a great alternative, if we were a little more hungry. It's a lot cheaper than say Mcdonald's or Golden Corral, and it's a local reasturant, not a chain, exactly what we were looking for. They did have a wonderful and clean pool, open late too. I would of thought to pay around $80-$90 for a room like this. But we got all of this for around $60. This place really gives you more \"bang for your buck\", and you don't have to sacrafice quality.

They put us on the other side of the pool and in order to get there I would have to go down the stairs or drive around to the pool. There was not enough parking places for the amount of rooms they have. We stayed there three nights. The breakfast was horrible. We had to eat elsewhere. The owners are rude and blame you for their mistakes. We had asked for their small hospitality room for Friday and Saturday night for our reunion they gave it to some one else to use. We have this booked since March. When our food arrived Saturday night they had another group in there. We asked if we could have some tables to use and eat outside. The lady owner was rude and told us we should have had it written on the calendar, that not our job it is her job. We had a signed contract for this. She told us the other people were going to do the christian thing for us and let us use it for an hour to eat. She was really huffy about it. Her husband then did help us set up the room. She shot daggers at us. The main one in our party also got jumped on to. Then she came back and apologized to her, but not me. Then my cousin who was schedule to catch a plane asked the desk to print out her boarding pass. They told her it was against their policy to do that. Luckily my son had his portable printer there and he did it for her. I have never heard of a place not helping you print out your boarding pass. The air conditioners quit they complained about fixing them. We had three rooms and the toilets had to be flushed several times. All in all our stay was not what we expected.

It enjoys a super location on Green Mountain, which is off 76 a little bit so that traffic is not so bad. The place itself is well-kept and clean. I didn't notice any signs of wear and tear. The decor is definitely \"homestyle\"- lots of mauves, paisleys, and floral. Someone at the front desk made a mistake and we ended up waiting quite a while to get through the check-in process. I was surprised that the person I worked with wasn't overly accomodating; almost blaming us for the mix-up. It ending up being fine and it was taken care of, but it wasn't all the glowing hospitality I'd heard about in previous reviews. The pool was nice and open late. I couldn't hear my neighbors, but I could hear outside noise. Beds were pretty hard, but not awful. I think the worst part was the breakfast. Trust me, I'm NOT a picky eater, but this breakfast was disgusting. Fruit tasted sour, biscuits were hard, gravy was bland. The \"juice\" tasted like it was made with powder packets.

Bob and Linda helped me get it loaded up in the DVD player in the breakfast room and I was able to sit and eat popcorn and relax and watch my DVD. What kind of a motel will let you do this?? Well, the Carriage House Inn, that's where! We went during a busy time period. There were a lot of bus tourists eating breakfast at the same time we were so the breakfast room was busy at times. My dad and I found a little table outside on the beautiful porch to eat and as we were eating, Linda came out to check on us and to tell us they could get some extra tables inside if we wanted. We were okay because it was a beautiful day, but the fact is they took the time to check on us. I like the fact they see their guests as friends. The breakfast is good. The donuts are fresh and made specially for the Carriage House. Linda has started making the biscuits for the sausage gravy. They've added bagels and cream cheese to the spread. The breakfast room is a fun place to go with Bob talking to all the guests. You can see how much he enjoys running this motel. He makes it seems less like a motel and more like a home away from home which is exactly how I feel when I'm there. The location is so convienient. It's not right on the strip in the \"hub-bub\" but just off the busy strip in a cozy area just about 1 min away from all the action. There is a restaurant right across the street if you wanted to walk someplace you easily could. The indoor pool is really nice. I wish you didn't have to walk outside to get to it because it's kinda chilly at night sometimes, but that's nothing!! It's a really nice pool area regardless. But keep in mind there is no whirlpool. Doesn't bother me, but I thought you should know incase that's something that's important to you. Internet works really good...even in our room which was at the other end of the motel. Everything was perfect. Should be at the top of the list. Best place to stay hands down. Has everything you could want in a room. Comfy beds, homey/cozy atmosphere, amazing staff, breakfast, indoor pool...simply the best! One tip...if you want a fridge/micro in your room tell them when you make a reservation. They will put you in a room that arleady has them and you are not charged extra!! I could go on and on all day about The Carriage House...there really aren't enough good things to say about it.

My trip ended and I didn't want to go home. This place is amazing. First of all this place is as clean as you can get. Our room was so nice and clean and spacious. We had a fridge and microwave in our room which was very helpful. The cleaning staff took care of our room on our time, whenever it was convenient for us. The owner of the motel runs the breakfast room. He makes sure everyone knows where everything is, and really makes an effort to get to know all of his guests. By the time we left I felt like we'd been friends with him for a long time. Get ready to have a good time with him...he's one of the friendliest men there is! There are I Love Lucy videos playing in the breakfast room in the afternoon in case you want a break from your room and would like to watch something on TV. He also has movies he'll put in for you. Breakfast was good...he's got a lady that makes the donuts for him, but don't ask for anything specific. She makes what she wants to make and that's that. (I'm sure you'll hear that story) :) He's also got Tropical Fruit, biscuits and gravy, breads of all assortments for toast, juices, coffee, milk...I think I'm missing something, but it was all really good. They also have trays at the breakfast room to make it easier to take coffee back to your room or whatever you want. My dad would go up every morning and get coffee for everyone and there would be Bob meeting him with a tray and a smile at the door. The trays are always washed when they are brought back to the breakfast room. I watched as he made sure everything was clean as it was put back out for the next person. The pool was nice and warm...the only thing is you have to walk outside to get there and we were there in April when it was pretty chilly...so it was a cold walk back to our room. But that's no big deal. Pool is open nice and late so you can go after a show if you want to. 11:30 I think it was. But there is no clock in the pool room...so you better take a watch or something to keep track of time. There were a few pool toys there when we were there if the kids want to play with a ball or something. They were also nice enough to let me print my tickets for the Wax Museum at the desk because it's cheaper when you buy online than when you purchase at the door. They had trouble with their printer, but they got it fixed and were as helpful as could be at getting those tickets printed for me. The whole inn is so well taken care of and landscaped so beautifully. Flowers hanging on the nice white porch. Sitting areas outside. Beautiful. I felt so comfortable there. It really was like a home away from home. I will go back as often as possible. Great job Bob and Linda!!
