We are Disney Vacation Club members and stayed in an efficiency. It was perfect for the two of us. As always, the service was excellent, the room, buildings and grounds spotlessly clean and the food awesome and plentiful. We also bought the refillable mugs (something we haven't done at the other Disney resorts) and definately got our money's worth. They are $18.99 and there are 3 refilling stations; one in the store and 2 by the pool on opposite sides. You can also fill it with coffee available in the store too. We ate at all of the restaurants and found them all to be excellent. One of my favorites, believe it or not, was the hot dog in the soft roll at Mama's snack shop! We are grandparents and kept thinking how much fun our grandchildren would have at this resort! Another nice feature is the paved path that follows along the 3 lagoons there at Ko Olina. We are runners and if you head south on the path starting at Aulani and run to last lagoon, it's about 1.25 miles. If you head inland on the sidewalk next to the park there and back on the sidewalk in front of the resorts, you can run to the security booth and back to Aulani and it's about 3 miles. We saw quite a few people swimming across the lagoons and running the grass between each before swimming the next. We were going to try it, but never had time. It looked like fun :) We rented a car and visited Pearl Harbor, Diamond Head, Waikiki and Haanuma Bay, all between 30 & 60 minutes away.

The Mexican restaurant across the street was not very good. The only con in our experience was aunty's child care. If you just need a baby sitter for a couple hours it works. I personal did not want to bring my child to Hawaii to play video games and watch tv . The kids who work in there do not interact with the kids.

We went with great expectations and for the most part, were not disappointed! We had a two bedroom villa giving everyone enough room to relax and enjoy. My mother-in-law especially liked having her own balcony which allowed her to go out and watch the sun rise in the morning without disturbing anyone else. I liked the balcony for the simple fact that I could enjoy the local evening entertainers in the lounge without leaving the comfort of my room! A large number of rooms are situated so that you have beach view (sometimes partially blocked by the architecture of the hotel) and overlook the pool area. The remaining rooms overlook the mountains inland, The room we stayed in was equipped with the standard kitchen stock as well as extra linens. The employees cannot do enough to help you! They are eager to share their experiences of the Islands as well as the culture. There is always at least 1 if not 2 people at the concierge and during busy times (12-6) it is staffed with 3 or more people. Our concierge, John, even helped us plan the second part of our vacation in Kauai- having grown up there he was able to give us tips for sight seeing and directions to various attractions. There is some much to do at Aulani that you will find yourself short on time to try and do everything. From making native crafts to hula lessons to paddle board rentals to snorkeling- there is something for everyone. Most activities are free however there are fees for the stingray pool adventure as well as the reef/snorkeling but they are nominal and it was definitely worth the money for the experience. Kids of all ages can search for the hidden Menehunes (there are over 300!) during their stay or obtain a hand held gaming device and participate in the Menehune Adventure Trail (Note: to participate in Adventure Trail you will need to leave room key or credit card info with staff member). Also, Disney offers their version of a Luau show which is free to all guests staying at the hotel which is performed weekly. (look for the guests of the nearby Marriott on their balconies watching it too! lol) Nightly \"Cousin\" intrigues all who gather around the fire pit with ancient Hawaiian tales of the Islands. The pools offer swimming for all ages and all activity levels- you can choose to just float among the hibiscus in the lazy river or lounge in the waterfall hot tub overlooking the beach or step it up a notch and ride the slides down the enchanted volcano set as the center piece of the main pool. At night the pools are illuminated from within casting a \"magic spell\" over the whole swimming area. Disney's beach accommodations are sure to please as well as chairs, umbrellas and beach toys are available for use free of charge for guests. Disney offers several different restaurants for all tastes- our only disappointment was that we weren't able to sample all of them due to bookings. Breakfast with Mickey and Minnie was very good if not a bit overpriced as were the other 2 restaurants on property. Given that we had a kitchen, we walked across the street to the small grocery store and made dinner in the room for 3 nights of our 10 night stay. The store on property is well stocked not just with the general Disney lot but with many Aulani specific merchandise and high end items. The grocery section is much like that of the other Disney resorts. This resort in my opinion, is one of Disney's highest achievements and they are continuing to improve it- many changes are coming in the next few years with the completion of rooms, new swimming areas, new dining etc. which will only add to it luster.

We spent about three days in the pool and resort without getting bored and I consider myself a very active person. The only negative I would have to say is the food selection. It is very expensive for what you get, in terms of both quality and portion size. The quick service locations are definitely not worth it right now. I say right now because with the new expansion starting in a few weeks Aulani will be adding more dining options.

Well that certainly can't be said of the Aulani. From the personal welcome you receive as you pull up, to the friendly staff all around the grounds, from the high end quality of the merchandise to the smallest detail of the beautifully themed resort it shouts Deluxe!. Clearly not believing that the usual Disney fare that is found in their theme parks around the world is up to the Aulani standards, the resort shop is stocked with high end resort themed goods handed to you in quality high end bags. The attention to detail of the resort is also unmatched. Not only is it a step up from the likes of the Grand California, Animal Kingdom Lodge or Polynesian but it also works. Its an Hawaiian themed hotel on Hawaii, not a Safari themed Lodge in Orlando. The rooms are a good size, especially the DVC one we had and they have clearly thought out how to use the space in the room with baggage storage under high beds and bathrooms which can handle 3 people at the same time!! A godsend if you have a family of 4. I won't describe all the facilities as you can find many websites which will do a far better job but will say that our two boys, 8 and 12, could easily have spent every waking moment at the pool and beach and not have been bored. My oldest particularly enjoyed Rainbow Reef. He still has his coloured wrist bands on over a week later. If you can afford this resort it is worth every single penny. I cannot recommend it enough. If I have to find a negative to the Aulani it would be the limited and expensive dining but I believe work is already under way to alleviate the problem with an extensive expansion of its facilities due to open summer 2013. Oh and while some reviewing on here say that its Isolated, surely that's a positive? If you've stayed in Waikiki you will know what I mean!

This is a family resort--my 8-year old daughter especially loved it. There are many water activities--lazy river, slides, water park area, pool. It can get crowded in the afternoon, and so as an adult you might miss the tranquility that you came to Hawaii for. But you can find it in the morning at the lagoon beach. Some days I walked to the JW Marriott next door, a quieter, elegant resort and beyond it to a small beach that looks like it could be a set for \"Lost.\" I personally prefer the two neighboring Marriott resorts because they are low-key, spacious, and less crowded. But my daughter preferred Aulani. She enjoyed seeing the Disney characters; we got pictures with a couple of them. We liked the menehune adventure trail --you get a device that directs you to different locations in the resort where magical things happen. (It was good but could be even better if it were less drawn out/chatty.) Aunty's beach house is basically onsite child care. It's a large space and kids can do the same kinds of things they would do at daycare though occasionally they have some Hawaiian activities. There's a separate family room, where we made leis once. I enjoyed the fireside storytelling with uncle --I learned a little about Hawaiian culture, though my daughter wasn't too interested. The resort has a magical feel at night. The shave ice was very good. The people who work there are cheerful and helpful. It feels very safe for kids. We rented a car online a few days before our trip and got a decent rate. I was glad we did because we were able to explore Oahu a few afternoons and eat at other places. But even if you don't rent a car there are still some options for meals beyond the resort. There's a shuttle that goes between the 3 resorts and Roy's restaurant. We took it a couple of times to eat at the Marriott beach club (Fia Fia luau and Longboards-- both recommended).", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stafford, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cVery nice relaxing stay\u201d", "Author": "Coastie16", "ReviewID": "UR139117750", "Content": "If you are seeking a nice relaxing Disney vacation without the rush of going to the various Parks, this is your place. This is in the western side of Oahu, Ko Olina. We arrived here, unfortunately during the Honolulu rush hour and took nearly an hour form the airport. When we drove into the valet area to check-in, Disney in their usual manner took over every aspect of making us feel at home. The lady who checked us in gave us a very nice Hawaiian welcome, a tour of the lobby area, the car was parked by valet (we were just too tire to use self park after nearly 15 hours of travel and up for over 24 hours), the luggage and groceries were unloaded and immediately taken to our room. Since we are DVC members, we had the option of getting an ocean view, pool view, island gardens view, or a standard view. We opted for the island gardens view. However, after staying here and watching the sunset over the ocean, next time, we will book an ocean view. We had a 1 bedroom with a full kitchen, very large living room, bedroom with a king-size bed, a bath area with a full vanity & jacuzzi tub, shower area with another vanity. The shower area was very large with 2 shower heads. Everything about the accommodations had the Polynesian theme... very warm and comforting. Our room was absolutely spotless. Since we did have a 1 bedroom, we also had 2 balconies. As with anything Disney does for its customers, the resort amenities are top notch. The lazy river is really nice, gets to be VERY crowded by mid-morning and good-luck trying to get one of the tubes. Many kids (and adults) tend to \"hog\" them for most of the day. Rainbow Reef allows guests to \"swim\" with tropical fish and the \"non-swimmers\" can view the fish (and swimmers) through observation windows. This is a very small \"reef\" and the number of people swimming is controlled. For those more adventuresome, Disney shares a lagoon with Marriott where you can swim, snorkel, rent small boats... etc. Snorkeling was great near the marker buoys. I was able to observe several tropical fish close-up. Please keep in mind you need to dive about 8 - 10 feet to get the better views. We did not have any bad experience with any employee, accommodations, or facilities. The grounds are perfectly manicured in the typical Disney style. I highly recommend the Luau show, movie nights, story telling by your \"cousin\" on Hawaiian folklore, and of course, just sitting on the beach doing absolutely nothing. I also recommend walking to the quiet beach area on the other side of the Marriott to check out the visiting Monk Seal and on occasion a huge sea turtle or two. We saw the turtle, but we kept missing the seal.

But.....it is so isolated that we had to pay $100 cab fee each way to to go Honolulu to do anything. If you do not plan to leave the resort, then you are good. (factor in $150-$200 round trip from the airport though as the hotel does not provide a shuttle and I think that they should for what you pay to stay there) O.K. the other positives are the amazing water features such as the lazy river and water slides. The kids loved those and the kids club (Aunty's Beach House) which is included in your stay from 12pm-9pm each day. The service through out the hotel was great, as Disney is known for. Now for the negatives.... The food is terrible! Not even good pancakes and they are not tough to make. Ama Ama is the only good meal we had. We went off property as much as possible. Go to Roys' across the street (you can walk there) and Azul at the Marriott right next door. (both were great dinners) Everything is so super over priced at the resort! They also need juice options at the drink stations so that your kids don't drink soda all week. They advertise a \"tween program\" but it was so disappointing. One event a day for an hour or so. And finally the whole pool chair mess of people going early in the morning and reserving chairs that they never return too is B.S! Often if you went to the pool you couldn't find a free chair! Disney needs to figure that one out! And you couldn't reserve a cabana because they were all booked up (there are only a few).

We have been to Disney's other premier properties (Grand Californian, Grand Floridian) and have been looking forward to staying at the Aulani. Disney has done an outstanding job here. You stay at a Disney property for the service and experience. Disney has figured out how to duplicate their customer experience regardless of the locale. I thought tht the Aulani might be a bit to \"fake\" especially being in Hawaii but they make it work! The centerpiece of the hotel are the pools, waterslides (2), and lazy river. Rooms are excellent and we recommend an ocean view if you can. Disney has done a great job acknowledging the 21st century with the most outlets I've ever seen in the room along with excellent wifi throughout the hotel (\"free\" with the mandatory resort fee). Yes the food is expensive but that is part of staying at a Disney property. You can save money by having appetizers at Off The Hook outdoor lounge or ordering at the pool. The other tip is to buy the all you can drink free refill mug when you arrive. It costs 19.00 but will pay for itself quickly. Use it for hot and cold drinks. Valet or self park costs 35/day.

At the Aulani, we had two standard view rooms, both having beautiful views of the sunrise over the mountains. The rooms are what you would expect from a deluxe Disney resort (similar to the Grand Californian or Animal Kingdom lodge). The pool complex compared favorably with other resorts with tremendous pools. The only better complex we have visited is at the Grand Waila in Maui. The lazy river is entertaining, while the slides are fast and fun even for adults. The beach is on a lagoon and lacks surf, which is great for little kids and boring for teens. The snorkling pool and ray pool again are terrific for smaller kids, but not so exciting for older kids who can snorkle in the real thing. My seven year old loved Auntie's Beach House and wanted to attend every night. He paticularly enjoyed the Chip and Dale surf party (which was an extra charge). Compared to Waikiki, nothing much happens in the Ko Olina area (where the Aulani is located). Ko Olina is great for spending time at the pools or the beach, but for restaurants, activities, or anything other than lounging by the water, you will need to travel to other areas of the island. Food at the Aulani is terribly expensive. Thus, if you are staying in the hotel, you will need a car to get to a reasonably priced eating alternative. Roys is a very nice restaurant nearby and not as expensive as the hotel restaurants. A couple of exits toward Waikiki, you will find an Outback Steakhouse, a Chili's, and other reasonably priced eating alternatives. As for activities, Shark's Cove on the North Shore had wonderful snorkling -- calm, shallow, and tons of fish. Kayaking at Kailua Bay is fantastic as is hiking to the top of Diamond Head.

The place has stunning architecture. At first glance the pool and lagoon area look inviting. We had wonderful Bell service as well as a welcoming greeting and mini-tour of the facilities. Since our room was not ready upon arrival, we decided to head to the pool area. No chairs were available. Many were claimed with towels and no one around them. We had some lunch which was the poolside restaurant and it tasted okay but was highly priced. We then thought it would be nice to try the lazy river. I think we finally claimed an innertube to float on in 20-30 minutes. We ended up counting them at night when the pool was closed. 43 single tubes and 11 double tubes!!!! And I wonder how many guests are staying there on a typical day??? I realize perhaps they are trying to make it not as crowded on the river but they need some kind of a system. You may be waiting for 15 minutes to get one, and some random person will get out and hand their tube to someone who just happens to walk up. It is extremely frustrating! Also, because there are not enough tubes, all the little children are swimming beside you splashing, swimming under you and kicking you and there is nothing \"lazy\" about it! I will say that my most relaxing time was at night between 8:30 and 10:00 at one of the jacuzzis when most of the children are down for the night. Don't get me wrong, I have a 10 year old, but he is watched and accounted for, not roaming around and being disruptive or rude! Then, my other complaint is the food. We were not happy with the buffet....43.00 per adult and not near worth it!! Ate at Ama Ama for breakfast. And it was better, a little more woth the money you pay. Unfortunately, even calling 2 weeks in advance, I was unable to book a dinner reservation there! We thought our room was very nice. It was a 2 bedroom villa. Had adorable little wooden Mickey lamps. Beds were very comfortable. But in the evening, we would look at the windows adjacent to our building and so many were dark at 8pm. I had a feeling that the hotel was not full, maybe not even half full and yet dinner reservations were hard to obtain and the pool chairs were full very early. The beach area was nice, plenty of chairs there. Umbrellas and boogie boards are available free of charge at the rental booth.

My kids spent most of every day playing with lots of other kids on a floating mickey raft in it. There was also an incredible pool area with a lazy tubing river, slides, etc. They had a man made saltwater lagoon stocked with fish you could snorkel in. Lots of activities for all ages. My 9 year old loved learning to play the ukelele. We stayed in the dedicated 2 bedroom villa. Most two bedrooms are the combination of a one bedroom and an adjoining studio villa. The dedicated's are very nice in that there is only one door to the hallway and the kitchenette area from the studio type room is replaced with an additional queen bed so there is more sleeping space. These units are also located all the way at the end of the hallways closest to the ocean. The very ends of the hallways which face ocean front are the 3 bedroom grand villas. These dedicated's are on the sides but right next to them and on an angle so you get a very nice ocean view. On one side of the hallway you look out over the pool area to the ocean lagoon and on the other side of the hallway you do have an expansive view of the ocean but you have to look over the Marriott parking garage next door. I much prefer the pool and ocean view. One other item worth noting is that typically in Hawaii you get nickle and dimed for every little thing. At this property the beach chairs and umbrellas were free, as were the bags of beach toys, boogie boards, flippers, most but not all activities and self parking was free if you are a vacation club member.

Just got back 2 days ago from our 8 night stay in Aulani. This place is gorgeous - Disney really did it right. In fact, the resort itself reminds me a little of the Animal Kindom Resort in FL. However, there are some things that they really still need to work on. For instance, the food. Very, very, very overpriced for what you get in terms of portions and especially QUALITY. The poolside fare is less than stellar - for instance, 3 chicken fingers & some fries for $10, wraps for $12 with nothing else; you get the picture. Good luck getting service - it is really sparse. You basically have to go seek the servers out to get any attention. Much better to go across the street to ABC store where they carry the same thing for 1/2 the price - literally. If you have a car, even better!! Just about 8 minutes drive away are a TON of stores and restaurants that are much nicer to eat at and much cheaper. Costco, Target, Outback, Denny's, and a myriad of other small restaurants worked out fine for us. We did eat at the the hotel 3 times -- once for dinner at Ama, Ama - food was delicious and typically priced. Once for the character breakfast which was fun - buffet was OK & once at Maka-something for dinner buffet - food was average. I would highly recommend you LEAVE the resort for food if you are able to. Other items of interest - staff are very friendly; however, when asked specific questions about activities or other things at the resort, they all seemed to have different answers and not very much knowledge of what's going on where they work. In addition, when something did go wrong, there was not much sensitivity shown AT ALL. I also noticed that they seemed to CARE LESS if you are there for any special occasion. We were there for our 10th anniversary and other guests we spoke to also were there for special occasions. Many other resorts give some small complimentary thing for occasions like that -- not here -- not even to DVC members. Kind of sad considering all the money that is being paid to this place. You would think you would at least take care of your DVC members!! Pools, lazy river, slides, water playground are all really nice. However, considering the size of the resort and the amount of rooms it has (and is still building on), I am REALLY surprised at the size of the pool area as it seems way TOO SMALL to accommodate any more people at all. We were able to find chairs every day with a little searching; however, there are not enough shade spots provided to get out of the very strong Hawaiian sun. Get more umbrellas Disney!! Rooms are typical Disney resort rooms - nice, clean, comfortable - no problems at all there. Aunty's Beach House for the kids is one of the best things about the resort.

That's it - I was bothered at times, but never to the extent where I stopped having a good time. The positives were big in my mind. The room - a standard hotel room, not a timeshare room, was good quality and had enough room for the four of us. The service - as good/friendly as I have ever had outside of a four seasons brand hotel. Jordan at the beach was particularly helpful and called us all by name, but everyone really want out of their way to be friendly, from the front desk to the trash can emptier at the pool. Speaking of the pool - if you have small kids, you will not find a more exciting pool experience in Hawaii, period. No swim up bar, but enough servers around to help with that. The lagoon in front of the hotel is one of the only man-made lagoons in the state, but it is connected directly to the ocean and is calm/perfect for little ones or teens who want to snorkel or stand up paddle board.

The staff is really great...Alan, Alohi'i, Sharon, Alex, Theresa (and all the kind people down at the beach) were all so wonderful and the trip would not have been as perfect without them...My 7 year old son loved Aunties Beach House and the premium programs with Chip and Dale and Fish are Friends. We loved hanging out in Cabana 1, tubing and swimming in the lazy river, paddle surfing, watching Hawaii Five 0 being filmed (and meeting one of the stars!). We found the food to be expensive as expected but fine (my 50th birthday dinner at Ama Ama was so delicious and the chocolate Mickey Mouse cake was incredible looking and tasting)..and except maybe for the character breakfast, we were able to get reservations easily. When we weren't renting a Cabana, we were able to get chairs at the pool or the beach without problem. The resort will be undergoing some overhauling....at least one new restaurant and fast food place, additional pools, more seating over the next year to accommodate the other 400 villas that aren't yet open. Watch for special deals while construction is going on. The Starlit Hui was great was is the menehune adventure trail. There was always so much to do and even one week (with some excursions to PCC and Waikiki) didn't give us enough time to do it all. The resort is beautiful and I love how it is not over the top Disney but retains the magic that is Disney. The spa was very beautiful and my sister and I both loved the various outdoor showers! We were so worried that we would feel overwhelmed by the crowds when leaving the tranquility of Kapalua, but Aulani never felt that crazy..just crazy fun! Would love to see the following at Aulani: malasadas (though Leonards Jr isn't too far away), better shave ice (if there is a way to contract with Ululani's that is the best shave ice on earth!), maybe a shrimp truck/shrimp stand, a little more movement to the lazy river..it is a little too lazy!).

The kayak rentals are reasonably priced, though it is hard to stay in the lagoon for a whole hour, maybe a 1/2 hour at most, we got a little bored after a while. With the amount of rooms there and still adding on, the beach is not huge but it did not seem over-crowded at all. I'm sure the lazy river, kids water park, and snorkeling will keep everyone from congregating in one area at once. Ama Ama had great food with a beautiful view. We got the roasted chicken salad sandwich which goes great with the field greens. We also had the burger with sweet potato fries. Bread pudding desert was not cheap but worth it and delicious! We went around 1pm which was a good time, not crowded. They close between 10:30-11am and also from 4:30-5. We actually tried 2 other times to eat there and it happened to be at those exact times. FYI: It seems like dinner requires reservations, we tend to eat early dinners so for us it would not be an issue. There is a gift shop that sells snacks, cold sandwiches, frozen dinners, breakfast items and other things you can bring up to your room. They are open until 11pm. Rooms are nicely designed, as most disney resorts are. My husband asked me \"how soon can we come back\" after being there about 30 minutes, and we don't even have kids yet. It was still fabulous. Check in was great and the staff very helpful and friendly. Not far from Honolulu, in a nice community. There is a hidden lagoon if you walk past the property onto the rocks (towards the Marriott side). This is not Disney property but the little lagoon is charming and they often have wedding photos taken there.

Likewise for the beach. The lazy river was full of people but never jammed and the 12 year old loved the water slides while my 6 year old loved the shallow water park area. Unfortunately we were not able to partake in any beach activities as they closed at 5:00 pm. The dining options were very limited but enough for the kids. Hot dogs and Shaved ice was plenty for them. As mentioned in other reviews this is far from other Disney Theme parks but it is not advertised as one and do not expect the same amenities as a theme park.

The rooms are very quiet, as well. And the maid/turn down service does a wonderful job! The lobby is very large and open. You are greeted by name (the entry gate radios your name and arrival) with flower or kukui leis. The staff makes an effort to remember your name through your visit (I have no idea how they do this!). The people that worked the various pool and beach rental huts knew both of my teenagers' names. You are also surrounded with the Hawaiian culture. The Disney theme is subtle and only displayed at announced events, such as greeting/autograph sessions and the wonderful Hawaiian show!. So you become lost in the true Hawaiian spirit. I loved the Hawaiian prayer song that played each morning at 7 a.m. There was nothing we didn't like about the the resort. It is absolutely beautiful! The gift shops were great, and the ladies that run the gift shops are so personable! If one thing could be improved, I think it would be that the lazy river was a little deeper with a little more current. You have to work a little too hard to float it. The Island Market, across the street from the Aulani, is a great place to obtain breakfast and lunch items at reasonable prices. Loved their bento lunches and spam musubis!

We received citrus water and were escorted inside to be given a brief overview of the resort. We were then given our keys and escorted to our rooms. Amazing service. Never even saw the checkin line. Our room was 2 bedroom and very nice with both a pull out couch and chair. It seemed well insulated and was very quiet. We had a mountain view room that just barely cleared the parking structure. It's what we paid for. :) There was a huge balcony and we used it for a quick stop in the morning but as we thought, we spent almost all our time outside enjoying the resort. We had 7 in the room. Maybe odd to mention but there were tons of elevators and they were quick. That was very nice. The restaurants that we tried had okay menus and hawaii prices but it was good and fresh. We bought the cups and even for just 3 days, definitely paid off plus a great momento. The nice girl at the Olelo room added whipped cream and chocolate syrup to the boys hot chocolate each morning. What a thoughtful thing to do and they loved it. In fact, even Dad got one. The coffee was wonderful too. Try the almond croissant. Yum. The pools were amazing! The kids thought the slide and the tube slide were better than Beach Club and almost as good at the water parks at Disney. I must admit, they were super fun, as was the lazy river. This area is in the middle of the resort (and along with restaurants and the water play area and hot tubs) allows you to feel tucked in and safe for kids. We got to the slides early and had almost zero wait ever. After a couple hours (just like at WDW), the people started coming out and things got much busier. The pool parties were fun and the characters were great and very involved. The kids did the snorkel Reef and loved it. The price can be for the entire day or can do a length of stay. We did it for a day and thought the price was great. We were told to come back during the feeding and the boys really loved that. The nice man would toss food right next to people so the fish would come up close. Aunty's house was great. After a watery morning, the boys went to Aunty's house both days and we couldn't get them to leave. They ate lunch and dinner there both times. The castmates were amazing and so nice. We really missed this part after we switched resorts. We came back for a character breakfast and found the food to be pretty good but the interaction with the characters was great.

We traveled during the peak summer season (mid-July 2012). Some days the resort felt empty, some days it was packed. I am concerned that 30%-40% of the rooms are still under construction. Once these rooms open, the summer crowds could be huge! Disney may have to build another swimming pool next summer to absorb the crowds. This is not a romantic place (think Four Seasons Maui). You will not be waited on like royalty by the swimming pool. You will have to fetch your own food and drinks. Not a big deal. Hard to be romantic when you brought all 4 kids! Pros: 1) Rooms. New and clean! 2) Location. 25-30 minute drive from airport. 45 minutes to Waikiki. 3) Location. 5 minute drive to stores (Target, Wal-Mart, Costco, Safeway, Chili's, etc.) 4) Water Slides.

Several things we did outside of Disney include Hawaiian Fire Surfing lessons, Dolphin Excursions snorkel trip, Arizona Memorial (Pearl Harbor), and the Paradise Cove Luau. All were excellent!

Would be happy to refer him. 2) So, with staying in a member suite, we had a FANTASTIC view, and some perks. Like free self-park and free movie rentals. FOOD - let's get right to it. It's a 5 star DISNEY resort in Hawaii. Not sure what people are expecting, but I thought the food was good and value was great by the pool - OK at AMA AMA. Meaning, AMA AMA was expensive, but the food was still good. And the pool food was also good, but was priced better. Our average pool bill for 2 adult meals and 1 child meal was $20. I mean really - that's good. (I live in Vancouver and I can't get McDonald's for the three of us for much less, and this was way better!) I can see how if you're only ever \"on resort\", and don't use your kitchenette, it could get stale, but we were quite content. Did the character breakfast, again, pricey - but no more so than character meals in Disneyland - and NO WAITS. Grocery store literally across the street, and for those who suggested Ray's across the street as a cheaper option...whoa - you've got to be kidding me. Just as costly, not as good. Shocking. The hotel next door had a nice Italian place that also was pricey and had good food. Between all these options, you should be able to find something to eat. They also have re-fillable mugs. $20 for the mug, all the pop and coffee you want for free. The shaved ice stand was a hit with the kid and their is a coffee shop, but we don't drink coffee, so no review on that one. ROOM Clean - new - fantastic patio and view. Kitchenette was helpful. Overall, very nice. (and I'm picky) They chose wisely on the patio doors. When they were closed we couldn't hear thing. Once open, the water features are loud, but hey, I was staring at the ocean, all was good with the world. GROUNDS Ohhhhh - so pretty. Well maintained and the friendly \"gardener\" guy was always out there, greeting you with a nice hello in the mornings. ACTIVITIES (KID) We were travelling with an 8 year old boy. He could have (literally) stayed all day, everyday, in the lazy river. (he was swimming and pushing us around on inner tubes - ensuring that we got dunked under each and every waterfall) The pool, also fantastic and the waterside (singular as one was out of commission while we were there) was great for those that used it. The kids water park was another amazing feature as well as rainbow reef. OK - Rainbow Reef - it's just a large cold pool with fish, but hey, I took great pictures and still loved it. Oh, and the Menehune Trail - fantastic gizmo - gotta do that one! We did the lei making class, and the turtle necklace. Yup, both cheesy, and both FREE. Again, free activity from a non all-inclusive hotel = job well done in my books. AUNTY'S HOUSE Sorry Disney - you kinda fell down on this one. My kid is 8 and your target market. We have done a Disney Cruise before and he was crying every night when he had to leave. Loved the staff, loved the crafts, science, exploration activities, etc. We had to force him to go to Aunty's - for like an hour. The staff was not \"Disney-rific\". I get that it's included in the price, which is essentially unheard of for Hawaii, but you still gotta make it fun. Even if I had to pay. (which I did for a premium experience) TIP for Disney...when on Castaway Cay, the staff had an island play centre. OUTSIDE, ON SAND, WITH WATER. Now THAT was a HIT! Get 'em outside! I mean really, I didn't take my kid to Hawaii to stare at video games. (hence, he was rarely there) SPA Freakin' amazing. Loved loved loved the Spa my first time. The serenity gardens are having a hard time competing with noise from next door, but that's not Disney's fault, just a shame. The couples massage was amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Now, the 2nd time - just as beautiful, only...I was there for a service with my son. He and I went to get our nails done. For nails (his hands, my hands and feet) our bill was in excess of $300. I had been warned before booking that he would not be allowed in the garden / pool area. Fine. I get it, the grown-ups are relaxing. However, when we got there, we were treated like 2nd class citizens...I mean, I know he's a boy, but he wanted his nails done in tiger stripes and giraffe print. And I was willing to pay for it. Show a little couth and treat him like a client. Would not go back to the spa due to how my son was treated. (ME = fruit water, snacks, story about Hawaii, stone to throw, etc. HIM = nada) BEACH Very clean and organized. Our son wanted to try to climb a coconut tree and Jordan (a young man working there) tried to teach him. Very cute. Then we thought we'd try out paddle boarding. Well, Jordan was again very helpful in getting us organized and showing him what to do. He must have realized we would not be out for long, and he didn't even charge us for the (very short term) rental. That was very classy I thought. CHAIRS (POOL AND BEACH) Easy to get - any time of day. CABANA We did a \"cabana day\" and it was our best day there! If you can afford it - splurge! And try to get Chelsea as your server! She's awesome. OUTDOOR ACTIVITES Movies, Starlit Hui - again, such great FREE features. I can't think of another property that will give you these sorts of entertainment for free. Honestly people.

Having stayed at several of the deluxe, moderate and \"value\" Disney resorts in Florida and Anaheim over the past years, we knew we had to merge our love for our 50th State and Disney once the Aulani development was announced. We weren't disappointed. We don't have children, are not DVC members and had a wonderful time at this resort. The resort property and location is beautiful and immaculately maintained ala' Disney. We had a standard, \"parking garage\" view room, but it was lovely as were the amenities. All our \"cast member\" encounters were impeccable. All staff interactions at any level of responsibility included greetings, \"Are you enjoying your stay at the Aulani?\" \"Is there anything we can do for you?\" \"Thank you for staying with us.\" etc. This kind of interaction was typical and consistent. Pre arrival customer service was also 5 Star. We had arranged for ground transportation and dinner reservations - with excellent results for both. We arrived on the weekend so with light traffic on the H-1 -- an easy quick trip. (If you call the Aulani in advance - they will arrange a private pick up with \"Charely's Taxi\" their vendor of choice. The driver was waiting for us when we deplaned.) Whole resort Ko O'lina area is security gated. So, guard after checking the Aulani list, is the first to say \"Welcome home, Mr. Ms. etc.\" Of course, they tip off the front Aulani entrance staff and you are given the same greeting by valet, greeters, etc. as you leave your vehicle. Soft drink offered and lei greeting. An individual cast member gives you a brief welcome, lobby tour and resort overview and then takes you to a sit down check in process. We arrived around 3 pm and it was very busy with continuous arrivals. They were staffed to the max. And no one had to wait. Jet lagged and tired -- we were in the room, including the bell man bringing the bags in 30 min. or less. We ate and drank at their high end Ama Ama, the moderate buffet venue (which has added an ala' carte menu also), bar areas, poolside service and had good experiences. Yes, it's all expensive.

Upon arrival, we received an amazing welcome - fresh leis, a menehune necklace for my daughter and a little fish made from a palm for my son. We were escorted to the front desk where I couldn't have been more excited. Once we made it to the room which was ready upon check in at 4:30 pm, I was met with sheer disappointment. My $1400 per night rate gave me a great view of the parking structure, next door Marriott hotel, blacktop below, with the ocean way off in the distance. I immediately called and was told that they had no availability BUT I could check out at 11 am the next day, put my bags in storage after interrupting our morning activities at 11 am to meet the bellman, have a hotel room from 11-4 and then check in again at 4 pm. I hesitantly agreed even though the next day was my 2 year olds birthday; I had 9 bags to move and $300 in groceries. That night was wonderful - Lion King under the stars so I thought, maybe I had too high of expectations and cancelled the move for the morning. Then, after 2 hours of trying to sleep and listening to road noise even on the 14th floor, I called the front desk to complain at 11:30 pm. At this point, I was infuriated and exhausted! I demanded a new room with a decent view by 12:30 pm the next day. They couldn't make any promises but would do their best and made notes in my file. The next morning, I visited the front desk with a forced friendly smile and made sure that things were in alignment for a 12:30 pm new room and I told them that I wasn't going anywhere until my new room was ready. I had to feed my 2 toddlers lunch and put them both down for naps at 1 pm. I was not about to have my belongings scattered between 3 rooms and bell service. They still said that they couldn't promise but they would try. I asked for a phone call at 12:30 pm to update the status. At 12:15, I brought my kids up to the room for lunch and called the front desk for an update. I was given a call back within 10 minutes and told my new room was ready.

We decided to do 8 nights of exploring Oahu based out of the Aston Waikiki Circle then do 3 nights of relaxing at the Aulani. We have 2 kids aged 10 and 8. First off, we are not used to fancy hotels where when you pull up, you are greeted by several guys trying to help you. We pulled up and from the car they called the front desk and our room was not ready (we were early so it was no surprise). They took our bags and they took our cell phone number and told us to enjoy the resort and they would txt us when our room was ready. The resort: The resort is amazing. A looooong lazy river, 2 decent sized water slides built into a fake mountain, several pools and a few hot tubs, one of them a 2 leveled infinity tub that looks out on the ocean. Our entire family loved it. For a cost, you can rent a stand up paddle board, snorkel gear, a sting ray experience where you get in with the rays, and a snorkel experience in a giant salt water aquarium that does a really good job of looking like a real reef. They even have an adventure trail for the kids where they can trigger fountains in the resort and other things using a droid phone which is provided by Disney and is free. Lots of things to do. The cost of the food was really expensive. We ate lunch at the resort but walked across the street for dinner (there is a pretty good deli (in a ABC store run market), a Hawaiian food plate lunch style of place, a California style Mexican food restaurant and an ice cream shop. Now, those restaurants are expensive as well (Hawaii expensive) but cheaper than the resort. The room: We had a garden view room reservation but they gave us one with an ocean view (but pushed back a ways). The rooms were really big (especially after being in the Waikiki Circle). The bath/shower was huge and everything was really nice. One thing to be aware of, if you have a choice, AVOID the 3rd floor. The third floor is the lobby floor and there is a ton of foot traffic between the elevators and the lobby and there are rooms between the two. That being said, we could not hear anything inside our room so I think they did a good job of soundproofing the rooms. One thing that was nice is that on check-out day, your room key (which functions as a charge card as well) works 'till midnight so you can use the resort 'till you need to catch your plane. They even have a really nice locker room and shower area (and lounge) where you can get cleaned up prior to the flight. Almost gives you an extra day of swimming (they even have a machine that gets the water out of your bathing suit (not a heated dryer).

The first part of our trip was spent on the Big Island. We are huge Disney fans, so we were very excited about coming here. Here are the pros and cons as we saw them: Cons: The welcoming was too intense. When we pulled up we had people trying to park our car, take our luggage, give us water, give us leis, give us a tour of the lobby and check us in - all within the first 5 minutes. We understand they had the best of intentions trying to show us what great service they had - but it was just too much, too fast! Our partial ocean view was very small part ocean and very big part parking garage. The resort layout was very confusing - which would be fine if there were maps in the room. You had to go to the big map in the lobby or at the pool to figure things out. As it was, we didn't find the 3rd hottub until our 4th day! There was generally no information about the resort available (such as excursions). You got the Daily Iwa with the next day's schedule, but it would have been nice to have information a few days in advance so you could plan. Really no place to eat lunch when you were by the pool. One Paddle Two Paddle was only open for dinner for some reason, so you had to either eat at Mama's (only hot dogs and chicken fingers) or get poolside service. I have to say the poolside service was wonderful - so this would be a pro. The weekends were so packed with people that it was unenjoyable. Pros: It is a beautiful property with so much detail. The activities such as storytelling, Starlit Hui...among others really tried to work Hawaiian culture into your stay. The slides were awesome! There was always a much shorter line for the body slide! The restaurants were all delicious. Yes, they were expensive, but we knew that and planned for it. During the week, the crowds were much lighter. We still needed to put a towel on our chairs by 9:00 to get the ones we wanted, but we at least got chairs! The outrigger canoe ride was great. ($100 per person) This was not really advertised anywhere and we had to go search out information on it - but it was totally worth it. One of our most fun experiences there. Go to Makihiki Joe's at the beach and inquire. Overall we did love our stay at Aulani after we got over the greeting and room view. Once we settled in it was so relaxing and beautiful. We tried to do everything we could - using the paddle boards, kayaks, snorkeling, etc...

So we thought that the \"Disney\" experience would make up for some of the overcharge. The staff is very nice and trained well. Nothing \"Special\" as they are trained to give the impression. Also, if you book... Ask what your room is facing. We got the room facing the parking and alarms were going off in the night... Keep us up, but this tells you to not leave anything in the car at night or is the security enough.

Except it is public, Disney does not tell you this in any of the brochures I have seen. Because they are overbooked and crowded the lines are some times unpredictable.

There are hundreds of reviews all generally/reasonably accurate so rather than re-hash all of it, I thought some core tips may be helpful to make your stay more enjoyable. General Comments. This is a nice property that does a good job of balancing the Disney rah rah with it being a Hawaiian Resort. The staff is good/helpful and if you are used to coming to a DVC location and using the \"welcome home\" aspect, you will not be disappointed. Rooms are well appointed, modern appliances, fully stocked like any other DVC property. In general, it's a nicely done DVC property given the DVC timeshare investment more value. Tip 1 - Food One exit down the highway is a full size, pretty new, Target with the Grocery section. There is a banner hanging off the side of building announcing its arrival so it's new and fully stocked. The prices are aligned with the island. Two exits down you will find an established Safeway. Both cater to locals and those who live in the many condos in the area. It is not like the grocery store across the way in Orlando. In addition, there is a Costco right by the Target. The Bell Desk has little cards with directions. Make your own meals is obviously the way to save money but you end up saving money just by getting a few cases of your favorite drinks and a 3 dollar big plastic cup as the all you can drink soft drink cup is 18 bucks. Tip 2 - Utensils and dishes. Simply put, ask for stuff and they will bring it up. Dishes, pitchers, whatever. Many people complained about it but they have a large stash and you can get pretty much anything on demand. Tip 3 - Pool/towels/chairs There is this rule where if you leave your seat for more than one hour, thy pack up your stuff and you collect it over where you get the towels. This is designed to deal with one and only one situation. People come out at 8a, grab seats, and leave for breakfast (or lunch or whatever). Some people have complained about this impacting the lazy river but in speaking to the workers, that rarely happens. If you have a reservation for breakfast at 8a, you can get towels, stake out chairs, eat and come back in an hour. More to the point the quiet pool is empty every morning so getting a nice spot over there is easy. Plus there is a great bar over there with poolside service. Go there, you'll like it. With kids, grab seats by the play area and you'll be set. This really is not a problem for the more sane of you. Lot's of high strung/high maint. people may get all cranky. On the beach, simple stuff. Umbrellas are free. You go up, ask, they set up, you're done. The cove is public, no lifeguards, but totally calm for the kids. At the height of each day, chairs and umbrellas are no problem. WiFi /Printing TIP It's free. No sign up, no log in, nothing. Just Disney-Guest and you are on. It's spotty on the balconies but down by the pool Disney-Lagoon works fine. Fine means, you can get your Gmail, get CNN, etc, but download/upload, not so much. In the business center, they charge for stuff being printed by the page which blows. Each of the concierge folks will print something for you. Make it a pdf and email it to them. Specifically, Teresa, being super nice since she offered to do this for me when I asked where to get stuff printed. It's a nice touch. Balconies don't have plugs. Ask for an extension cord, bring one, etc, and run it out there. Keep in mind the Air Conditioner goes off if you have the balcony door open for an extended time. TIP/Caution: Room noise. Apart from the main entrance to the condos, the doors inside are all doors with slats. It means that the kid who goes down for the nap, will here everything. It means in the 3 bedroom, big time suite, you can hear the bathroom at one end with every door closed all the way in the other end. Just saying. Light sleepers, etc, you can't really close a bedroom door and get a quiet. It's odd design but there you go. Final thoughts We dropped 1500 points (DVC people know this is a huge chunk) via a combination of saving/borrowing, etc for the two villas we had here. It's very well done. DVC members get free parking, others pay 30 bucks a day which, by the way, is the same for valet. You will really like the place if you are looking for a combination of pool/beach time to relax. You won't like it, if you are looking for a \"Disney\" experience like Orlando or California. The Disney stuff is low key.

We had an unforgettable time! I would like to congratulate and thank the Aulani for Auntie's Beach House. The time my kids spent there was some of the best of our entire 7 night stay in Hawaii. Auntie has outdone herself! The staff was warm and obviously so happy to work there. I could not believe that it was all for free/included in the rate. Which though astronomically high, was worth every cent! The pool area is one of the best I have ever seen. The slide and lazy river pool was so much fun. Do not leave without trying the shave ice! All around, the staff was very friendly and professional. The rooms: Unfortunately, even though this is the one of the most expensive hotels we have ever stay at. There is nothing plush or luxurious about the rooms. We have stayed at other Disney hotels in Orlando and Anaheim. As expected, the Aulani has the same small, clean rooms. Even though I booked what I thought would be higher category DVC ocean view, studio. When I saw how small it was, I asked to be downgraded to a 2 queen, no view room instead. They claim that they are both the same size. Yet somehow, the 2 Q felt roomier. We lost the wet bar and view in the move. But with the money we saved, we did some extra paid activities in the hotel. Like snorkel in the awesome man made coral reef pool. The kids also had dinner with Chip and Dale. Both of these activities turned out to be their favorites at the hotel. Unless you are in a one bedroom DVC villa (we got a glimpse at one), the lowest category room in just fine. You will not be spending any time there. If you are doing the Aulani right. You will be out having fun. The Spa: While the kids were at Auntie's, my husband and I took in the spa. It was the nicest spa ever. Very environmental in their approach. I loved the outdoor pools. The staff was great. They are there to serve! Serve tea, water, blankets, muffins, anything you need. I wish I was there right now. Eating: We spent one amazing afternoon watching the NBA playoffs at Off the Hook restaurant which was right off the pool. Typical yummy, (not so pricey), bar food. Like in all Hawaii, the drinks are too expensive. But the bartender was great. We also had one \"fine\" meal at 'Ama'Ama. The food was tasty. The problem is that for the price, you expect a more refined environment. Or at least have the guests change out of their pool clothes. There should be at least one adults only restaurant on site. I think that they might have missed the mark on that by not building an upscale restaurant in one of the towers. It would have been nice to have a high view of the ocean away from the excitement of the pool area. I wish we had gone next door to the JW for dinner instead. Not overcrowded: One of the reasons I so enjoyed my time at Aulani was that it did not feel crowded. We did not struggle to find pool chairs. Or wait very long for a drink. The reason for this might be because they have only opened one of the 2 room towers. I have no idea where all the guests from the 2nd tower will go when it opens. When it does, I anticipate overcrowding and a change in the chill, happy environment. I would go now, before it opens. Not very Disneyfied: The Aulani is all the buzz with locals and tourist alike. We heard a lot of excitement when we told people we were on our way there. It represents Disney for those that have not been to the theme parks. Those people might come here and be disappointed. It is not a theme park! Sure there are a few characters walking around. But nothing like you would expect if you are looking for a extreme Disney experience. Even the gift shop is understated. We had a hard time finding Disney items to bring home. I get their non-commercial Hawaiian approach. I was not expecting to find the Disney Store.

My wife was working on a Summer vacation and was looking at us all going to California for 10 days or so. Hawaii was a destination we talked about many times, but deciding to spend that much $$ was always tough. When we looked at the price of the California trip, I just thought, if we use our Disney points on a room at Aulani then the money for the plane tickets and spending will balance out...let's just go to Hawaii. Didn't have to tell my wife that twice. She immediately got on the phone with DVC to see what kind of room we could get and how many points. We were thrilled that we would only have to borrow a few points from next year to have enough to stay for 9 nights in a one-bedroom. The place was UNBELIEVABLE. There was so much to do and see. We absolutely loved the resort. It is a bit of a drive from Waikiki and all that night life...which was great for us, but some people may prefer to be in that area. The pools, lazy river, restaurants and beach were fantastic. We were walking distance from Paradise Cove luau which we really enjoyed. Our room had a full kitchen. We made a couple of trips to grocery store and made plenty of breakfasts and lunches in the room. We ate at the resort's restaurants for other meals and had a car and ate around the island for other meals. We ended up spending a lot less than we would have on the California trip as my wife and I had enough skymiles to pay for our flights. 2 kids flights, excursions and meals was all we really had to come out of pocket for. We would have probably never gotten to do as many excursions had we not been able to use our Disney points on our room. The room was, of course, new and very nice. The view from our balcony was just breathtaking. The resort was not yet fully completed and probably 1/4 to 1/3 of the rooms were not open yet so I don't know how crowded things will get when it is fully operational, but we had no problem with crowds or lines at all. I recommend a rental car unless you've been there before and seen all there is around the island. We spent several days driving around the island and seeing some of the other famous beaches and areas such as Sunset Beach, the North Shore, Pipeline Beach, Waimea Valley, Pearl Harbor, Kualoa Ranch, Dole Pineapple Plantation, etc... It was also great to have a car to go to the store, etc.. There is an ABC store across the street from Aulani in a strip that had lots of items at reasonable prices that you could get if you did not have a car. We found the Wal-Mart and Target to be much more reasonable on grocery prices than Safeway. We do not have Safeway where we live so we were not familiar with them, but went there first and thought the groceries in HA were just a lot more expensive, but after going to Target and Wal-Mart we found Safeway was just much higher. This resort is fabulous and you don't have to have kids to enjoy it, though they will love it.

As DVC members it was free but cash guests need to work the parking fee into their budgets if renting a car. Overall I would say the only complaint would be the food. Resort food is often not the best but we felt Aulani was overpriced for the quality of the food served. The exception was Ama Ama, a very good resturant. It is best to get lunch and snacks from the ABC store accross the street. The quality of the food for the price is much better there. The spa was simply amazing!!

We love Disney because of all the little things that they do that you take for granted sometimes till you go somewhere where they don't do them.The theming,friendliness,cleanliness, and overall convience of stuff. We love the Polynesian Resort at WDW but it kinda looks like the ugly sister next to Aulani. Turquoise lagoon, pretty lazy river ladscaped with trees,plants and disney rocks and mountains. We had two connecting rooms facing the waterpark so no view of parking lot for us.Higher floors would possibly see some lagoon but maybe more expensive? Ama Ama for breakfast was delightful and yes it is expensive but it is Disney in Hawaii so plan for it . Also we had reservations for breakfast months in advance but I make dinning reservations at WDW 6 months out as does thousands of people so no big deal to me. Can always cancel. Cabana was nice but when I inquired about which one we would get( reserved 6 months out) front desk said would get assignment on the day of rental. That was at @1:30 PM , by 4:30 font desk called room and said all cabanas had been reserved except near kids play area or back in the side of resort by quiet pool. What?! She said they were assigned by order of when they were made. More than 6 months? I don't think so. Best one is cabana #1 by lagoon, we got #7. Heard that Disney management were there that day and those were reserved for them. Never saw anyone in them all day. Only hiccup in a great stay. We loved the song they play sometimes in lobby that sounds kind of native american with Hawaiian flair, my daughters danced around every time they here it. Our ages were 56,52,23,21,17,15, and this was our 25 wedding anniversary trip with yes , the kids. We all love each other and momma wanted them to come and what momma wants momma usually gets.

Also great hotel in different way Read that review, but Aulani is stunning in its on right . Blends in with the Hawaiian coast like the national park lodges Ahwahnee and Old Fathful Inn blend in with their surroundings. Also Starlit Hui was good show on Thursday .

That it is on the other side of the world, and we that we didn't stay longer. This was without question, one of the most wonderful places my wife and I have ever stayed. And we have stayed in some EXTRAORDINARY places. We are mid-50s and traveled alone. We have been Vacation Club owners for more than 12 years, and used our points for a deluxe ocean view studio for 8 nights June 25th-July 3rd. Pictures just don't do this place justice. Had we any concept of how beautiful it was in real life, we would have stretched our vacation two or three more days. If you have a car during your stay you will find the hotel perfectly situated to everything there is to see on Oahu. As long as you leave after morning rush hour and return before the afternoon rush, you can be almost anywhere in 25 minutes, forty minutes max. During our stay we visited Pearl Harbor, climbed diamond head, drove around the spectacular southeast corner of the Island, crossed the Pali highway, swam in Waimea Falls, saw the Sea Turtles on the north shore, flew to Kauai for a day AND stopped at the famous north shore shrimp trucks. All without hassle. Whatever food problems there were with this place seem to solved. Literally every bar serves some sort hot and cold snack, Mamas Snack Shack sells hot dogs and chicken tenders, and the Makahiki Grill now serves an a la carte lunch which includes build your own sandwiches, personal Pizzas, salads and burgers. Ama Ama is absolutely one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in. We ate there twice for dinner and twice for breakfast. The price is comparable to any top notch restaurant in any city however the location is over the top. Be SURE to make reservations well in advance if you want a sunset seating. Generally after 8PM, reservations for small groups are not needed and you'll be seated within 5 to 10 minutes. All basic food IS a tad on the pricey end but YOU ARE IN FRIGGIN PARADISE, AT A FABULOUS RESORT, A FIVE HOUR PLANE RIDE FROM ANYWHERE!!! It IS going to cost more. In the Safeway market Raisin Bran was almost 8 dollars a box. The food is not out of line for the location. As everyone else has reported, there are more than enough more reasonably priced family restaurants, pizza huts and papa johns all within two miles to help ease the budget. Once again a car is a must. Our most enjoyable lunches were at road side places while exploring, and most under 20 bucks for 2. The pools, lazy river, and beach were sheer heaven. There were more than enough chairs everywhere and at 100 percent occupancy nothing seemed overly crowded. There was live music in two locations nightly, the starlit hui show, storytelling by the fire pit, a real neat Menehune Trail (Following directions on an iphone they give you makes statues move, things appear, and many more surprises) and more than enough activities ranging from Hula lessons to yoga. An excellent footpath spans the waterfront of all the Ko Olina resorts and it makes for a GREAT 3 mile walk or run to start the day off. Buy a refillable mug- even if you don't think you need it. We didn't. On morning coffee alone I spent more, because I always needed more coffee after I had my room brewed cup. Finally there is the staff. I have never enjoyed a staff more. EVER!! They truly welcome you almost as family to their Island. Experiencing the Hawaiian culture and people daily was the high point of our trip. They are warm, friendly, helpful and entertaining. They absolutely are the icing on this wonderful cake that is Aulani. The resort is NOT for everyone. Everything stops at 11, so those in their 20's and 30's may require more nightlife. For families and anyone wanting to not only see Hawaii but experience it daily on their stay, look no further. Aulani has been open less than a year and they seem to be constantly adjusting things for the better. Mark my words, by my next visit I would bet they will have an adults only hot tub. And there absolutely WILL be a next visit. My wife has informed me we WILL be returning for ten days in three years. Happy Wife, Happy Life.

It was nice to have a kitchenette and I used it the first three days to make breakfast before I went on excursions. I rented a car at Aulani and did my own day trips. I visited several musuems, Diamond Head Crater(the walk to the top is not for the faint of heart, but I made it!), 'Iolani Palace and Pearl Harbor. Aulani does offer numerous excursions, but for a lot of them you have to get to Waikiki to pick them up. However, I did do the Aulani excursion to the Polynesian Cultural Center(PCC). It makes for a long day, but is well worth the money to find out about the Polynesian islands and have someone else drive the hour each way to and from the facility. Dining at Aulani has something for everyone. The Character Breakfast was great. They have a program they do with Aunty during the breakfast and kids are encouraged to join in. All the other meals I ate at Ama Ama for breakfast and dinner were fabulous. Yes dinner can be expensive, but do your homework before you go. They also have quick service options(hotdogs, chicken fingers, etc.) by the pool and there are shops and an ABC store across the street that has a small grocery store, some quick service food and a gift shop.

I had read all the reviews so wondered what we would find. Well first I need to say that all three of us loved the Aulani and my youngest daughter cried when we had to leave. When we arrived at the hotel it took our breath away and really felt overwhelmed. The staff immediately welcome you and give you a lot of information and help you check in to your room. We arrived early but were able to immediately check into our room. We were in a DVC studio room on the 15th floor with fantastic views of the ocean and the whole resort. My daughters were beside themselves when they saw the view with all the swimming pools. The room itself was nicely furnished with a nice microwave and refrigerator and shower. I wasn't much of a fan of the high bed and the room didn't feel that large for three people. But I spent most of my time in the room on the large lanai looking at the lights, listening to music, and at the ocean. I also missed not having housekeeping as they only clean your room every fourth day- which means they cleaned the room when we left. The garbage could have been emptied and I would have liked clean towels. ( Although we did get some more) I think in the one bedroom there is a washer and dryer so you can easily do your own laundry. They did tell us they would give us a token to go do laundry but I didn't want to spend my time doing that. I also saw you could pay additional money for extra services. They did have plates, silverware and coffee cups. Also had coffee for every day I was there. There was a dvd player and nice tv. My kids loved the water slides and we all loved the lazy river. Don't know how many times we went around the river. We also enjoyed the swimming pools and the whirpool spa looking over the ocean. We also spent a day at the beach and the sand was very soft and the water very calm. There were many chairs by the beach. You could rent an umbrella and other items if you wanted. The chairs around the pools were busy, but we always found three seats together. I think if you wanted the prime seats you would need to get up and down there around 8:00. We spent most of the time in the water so didn't really care what seats we had just so they were together. My kids were a little too old for the Disney Character activities, but we enjoyed watching the pool parties and dancing - even if my kids wouldn't participate. My daughters loved taking pictures with the characters and we really didn't have long lines to take the pictures. The Disney Characters were rather low key and it was more like you discovered the characters while you were doing something else. They only have Mickey, Minnie, Goofy as the main characters with sightings of Donald Duck, Stitch, and Chip and Dale. There are photographers who take rather good pictures and also will take pictures with your camera. My kids were having so much fun in the water we really didn't participate in the activities like learning to do the hula during the day. We went over to Aunties Beach House and my kids had no interest when they saw how young the kids were at the center. My oldest stated that they all looked hopeful that we were their parents and were going to take them out of the place. I'm not sure that is true. My daughter's loved the Menehune (sp) trail. It is a hand held device that you check out and Auntie gives you clues of places to go around the property and magical transformations happen. There are 5 or 6 trails and my girls loved figuring out the clues and the exciting things that occured. I think it was perfect for their age and they were really good at it. We also enjoyed making our free Disney postcard to send to ourselves and others. There are also DVD's to rent but we didn't. The hula show was enjoyable although I think my girls liked the dance party afterwards better. They were very disappointed the next night when the movie that was supposed to be shown was cancelled and they did the hula show again. There was no apologies about this but I know a lot of kids were disappointed. I'm sure the people who hadn't seen the hula show were happy. However we sat outside and listened to music and went to the gift shop, which is expensive, but we did buy some little trinkets. OK - now for the food. We had just spend 5 days in Waikiki where there was every restaurant you would ever want to go to in walking distance and we stayed at the Embassy Suites were we had full really good breakfasts. So we had eaten at a lot of nice places prior to our arrival so didn't feel the same type of disappointment others who go there and spent their whole time there. Aulani and the other hotels there reminded me more of visiting Maui where all the food is very expensive. It also looked more like Maui. The food we got at the fast food places were all very good. The kids meals were only 6.95 and included a drink which I don't think is bad. I loved their vegetable wrap and my kids liked the chicken fingers. The first night I had some Kobe Beef sliders that were expensive but of quality. They now have a Mama's place that serves hot dogs. My kids also loved the shaved ices. We had those every day. We also bought two 18.00 mugs and filled the cups non stop with lemonade, power aide and coffee. It was a good investment and a rememberance of Aulani. We also never had bad service. We never ate at the two big restaurants at night so have no comment. We went next door to JW Marriot and went to their Italian restaurant one night. It was pretty with horrible service and nasty food. My daughter's simple pasta with sauce was 18.00. Now that is a rip off. The problem is we never wanted to leave the resort because we loved it so much. We never even went across the street to the store or fast food restaurants we read about. We just tried to figure out how to make do. The last night staff at the Aulani suggested the Long Board restaurant at the Beach Club. We finally had the energy to drive down there and they had complimentary valet parking. The place is casual and by the water. Great food - but not cheap. Would definately recommend this place and wish we had made it more than once. Ok - now for our only real disappointment - the Character Breakfast. I would never do it again. The Characters were Micky as you walked in and took a picture. ( Bought the picture so we could pretend we had a good time) The only characters that come around are Goofy and Minnie Mouse. That is it. Auntie leads some activities that are for younger kids. I felt rushed like they wanted us in and out. They charged my 11 year old 32.00 for her breakfast when she ate 5 bites. Both of my girls said the food was nasty and that it hurt their stomachs. It didn't look bad but I think it sits out or something. It felt like a total rip off and I felt kind of like a fool for being conned into spending over 100.00 for it. Maybe if your kids are younger it would be worth it. But really if you are staying there your kids can hug all the characters without going to the breakfast. In fact as we walked out Stitch was taking pictures outside of the breakfast and we got a really cute picture with him. But as I stated he was not part of the breakfast at all. I would highly recommend this place to families with children 12 and under. If you have teenagers and they are fine just sitting by the water or hanging out at a calm beach then great. I don't think I would choose this place if I was on my honeymoon or with out kids. Go to Maui to a quiet more romantic resort. Or maybe off season when there is less children. But if you have kids it is a blast. Many of the activities were for younger kids so maybe they can work on creating things for the tweens and teens. If you want a place that feels like Disneyland you will be very disappointed. This is a Hawaiian resort with understated Disney activities. It is wonderful.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAn Amazing Resort on Oahu\u201d", "Author": "Imhoff603", "ReviewID": "UR133208893", "Content": "We spent a week at Aulani and had a great time with our two kids (11 and 13).

We had a regular room with two double beds. I didn't care about the view since we didn't plan on staying in the room much. We ended up with a view of the mountain, partial garage view. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted and directed to our room. I've read many reviews about the food. I can offer advice here. Buy Disney gift cards before you go. I bought a 50.00 card every paycheck and had almost 500.00 to use for breakfast each morning. We had breakfast at Ama Ama three times. It was great. The view of the ocean is spectacular. I would recommend the crepes which are not listed on the menu. We did the Character breakfast one time and the food was average buffet food. I would recommend it for the kids just once while you're there. As far as dinner, we ate at Roy's down at the golf course, Just Tacos across the street, Chuck's Steakhouse at the Marriot Beach Club, and the Sushi place at Ilhani resort next door. We also drove one exit down and ate at Outback which was excellent. Another day, we took the shopping shuttle to Al Moana and ate at Bubba Gump's Shrimp, yummy. Of all of these restaurants, I would definitely go back to Roy's and Chuck's. The water rides were so much fun for my little guy. He loved the two person tube and even single tube rides. You receive a different colored bracelet for each day you are there. So, he collected about a week's worth of bracelets until we left. Many of the children had on their previous bracelets and it was cute. I am not a person to leave my son with strangers, however I did go to the the Aunty's open house with my son. I decided it was safe since they have electronic bracelets and require both a driver's license and password to pick up your child. He made space goo with Stitch and an exploding volcano among other activities. I would recommend renting a car to go to Pearl Harbor. I wanted to go to the volcano, but it looked like a long drive. You probably can catch a shuttle from Al Moana shopping center. At Al Moana they have shuttles to take you to Waikiki if you are interested. We will probably do that next time.

The buffet is terrible. Lots of people were going over to the Marriott to eat. We vacationed here prior to Disney as well. This use to be a quiet area where you could listen to the ocean at night and take a moonlit walk. Now every night Disney either has an outdoor show which includes lots of screaming through a microphone or blasts movies until ten at night on a huge outdoor screen. Depending on your group this may or may not be your thing. If your thoughts of Hawaii include romantic, tiki torch lit dinners at sunset, you should be aware that this resort has brought the Disney to Hawaii, and not the Hawaii to Disney. It's a shame Disney has ruined the ambiance of the Ko Olina area. It seems like they might try to be more respectful of tourists who might not find the sound of a blasting Disney movie at ten p.m. echoing across the lagoons the ideal Hawaii vacation experience.

After reading the reviews I was a little unsure of the place but when I got there I realized none of these were true. From the time we arrived, the service was prompt! We loved our leis and the fact that valet parking was the same price as self parking! We immediately went down to the pool. It isn't impossible to find chairs if you get down there early enough (we would usually be down there by 8 AM). It's a little harder to find umbrellas, but there are so many trees that shade isn't a huge issue. The grounds were absolutely spotless! One thing that I loved about the pool area was the ice water stations set up around the pools. The slides were amazing, especially the tube slide, and the pool and lazy river were perfect to cool off. I found the infiniti spas to be a little hot, but I was sunburned. We didn't spend as much time on the beach as we were planning to, though it was very nice! We planned to go paddle surfing but instead opted for the 6-man catamaran ride, which is highly recommended! We loved reading the Daily Iwa to find the character meetups, and were suprised to find that the lines to meet them were not long at all! We filled our photopass with fun pictures taken with the characters. We had a standard view room but couldn't complain at all. The parking garage looked nice, and we could still see a little bit of ocean! I really loved how big the bathrooms were and that there was space under the beds to store luggage! Nearly every review I read complained of the food. I am an EXTREMELY picky eater but found the food to be incredible. We were only planning on dining at Ama Ama one night and going off property for other meals, but found it completely unnecessary. We tried every restaurant and lounge at the resort and went back to some places because we thought the food was delicious. We also planned to stop at Costco to pick up food for the daytime and never went because we were completely satisfied with what the resort had. We ended up going to Off the Hook for lunch everyday. I recommend trying the smoothies and turkey wraps! For breakfast in the morning we took the five minute walk to the ABC Store (Island Country Market) and found a decent selection of food and snacks. Obviously it is Disney and Hawaii, so everything is going to be a little more expensive than normal! But the food was definitely worth the price! Many people wouldn't think that this is the first place to come for a family with two older daughters, but I found it to be a ton of fun. I am a huge fan of Disney, but the whole Disney aspect of it was not overdone. The resort emphasized Hawaiian culture first, and Disney second. I got exactly what I wanted from this vacation: to relax and spend some quality time with my family. Tips: If you're not starving for dinner, visit the Olelo Room, a bar and lounge that also serves appetizers. We had dinner here twice, and ordered a bunch of delicious appetizers that managed to make us full. Valet Park! It's the same price as self parking! Get the soda mugs for the pool. One time price for unlimited refills! Get breakfast at the Island Country Market/ABC Store, it's a short walk. Fill up your photopass. We bought a disc at the end of the trip for a $99 flat rate, however many pictures you have. Go down to the beach at sunset, sometimes they have photopass people there that will do a free sunset photoshoot for your family. Walk past the JW Marriott, past the signs that say \"You are now leaving Resort Property\" and onto the rocks for some great sunset views Visit the gift shop! They have tons of cool resort merchandise! Go to the evening storytelling down at the fire pit near Ama Ama. We found Uncle to be highly entertaining Read your Daily Iwa for all the events going on around the resort Overall this was one of the best vacations I have ever taken with my family, and we have been to our fair share of resorts.

First the good points, they really do cater to kids. The pool was my kids favorite. Getting to see the characters several times a day was awesome. The kids program is great, never felt safer dropping my kids off and leaving (however you are not supposed to leave the property). The resort is beautiful and the staff is friendly. Now the not so good. The resort only had two of the three towers open and seemed crowded but we usually could find chairs by the pool and didn't have to wait to long for water activities, however once that other tower opens it is going to get really crowded (like most Disney attractions). Valet parking is not worth the money they charge, they were slow and most were not super helpful with off property directions. We changed to self park since we were not impressed with the valet, and the parking garage is a bear to navigate if you are driving any thing other than a subcompact car (we had an xterra) and fairly full (still only 2 of the 3 towers open). We did the character breakfast and the food was average (not great) but the kids loved it so that is a wash. Only one store to shop in on property. Kids program was great, but several of the things they do are premium experiences ($$$) and they don't tell you that certain experiences have limited space so you should reserve them in advance. My kids were super bummed that they did not get to do Stitches Space Goo because no one told us to reserve it early and it was full. We went on a Menehune hunt instead (my kids found 90 of the little guys). Some of the staff seemed to still be learning their jobs and this was frustrating at times. Also this property is isolated with three other properties so there is not much to do in the area for shopping type activities. It does appear to be building up so this might not be an issue in a year or two? Will I go back, probably not for the price.

We are Disney Vacation Club members and own at Aulani, but this was our first trip. What an amazing time! First, we had a deluxe studio room overlooking the pool and the ocean - what a stunning view. Nothing like waking up to the Waikolohe Valley every day. We found the room perfecly big enough and had a kitchenette we used to store breakfast and lunch items. The bathroom was huge and the toiletries were wonderful - the shampoo left my hair so soft! The hotel itself was stunning. A beautiful open air lobby with details hidden all around - make sure you look for the menehune! We found the pool to be wonderful and spent a lot of time there - we never had a problem finding a lounge chair with an umbrella for shade. We took full advantage of all of the activities offered at the resort - there were so many things for free I couldn't believe it. Well above and beyond other resorts in Hawaii and no resort fee! We did ukulele lessons, lei making, the menehune adventure trail, and more exercise classes than I can count - yoga, boot camp on the beach, core, and many more. The cast members in the fitness center and the Pau Hana room were amazing. They really made you feel at home. I also appreciated some of the special touches Aulani had - ice cold water by the pools and cast members passing out ice pops around the pool. It's little touches like that other hotels overlook and really set Disney apart. Some people complain about the location - I did not find it as remote as everyone says. Sure, you're 40 minutes or so from Waikiki, but I appreciated this. Made it feel more of a vacation and 'resort' than being in the middle of a city. It was also closer to get up to the North Shore from Aulani than it would be from Waikiki, and closer to get to Pearl Harbor as well. Definitely do not hesitate to stay here because of location. The only two complaints I have are the ones that everyone else does - there is not enough food and the food that is there isn't the best quality. Sure, Ama Ama was wonderful for our anniversary dinner, but it is pricey and the menu doesn't change so you really don't want to eat there more than one night. We loved the shave ice stand as well - pricey, but just as good as Matsumoto's up on the North Shore. However, we went to Makahiki for dinner and it was so awful I sent my food back. Breakfast was much better. the Olelo room has EXCELLENT appetizers that you could make a dinner out of - try the clamari and nachoes! My other complaint would be that there's not enough entertainment at night. Twice a week you have the Starlit Hui, but otherwise all activities stop around 4-4:30. Some nights will be star gazing for a fee, and Uncle tells stories around the fire pit, and there will be some mellow Hawaiian music at the Olelo Room, but there is no place to go that has things to do. I wish they'd take a hint from the Disney Cruise Line and have different shows or performers every night - it does get boring after your first night and we usually found ourselves in our villa by 8 watching a DVD. I had a massage at the spa - phenomenal. I don't even have words to describe the entire experience. Just spending an hour in the Kula Wai garden is well worth the price of a treatment. It's complete relaxation. Overall, though, we had a wonderful trip and cannot wait to go back. We were so sad when it was time to leave.

We stayed the first 5 nights of our stay in the North Shore at Turtle Bay, and then ended out trip at Aulani. What a great decision..plenty of time to explore everything in the North Shore area and then settle in for total relaxation and pampering at Aulani. The service here was impeccable...even at the beach there are FREE umbrellas, FREE boogie boards (adult and kid sizes), FREE giant bags of sand toys to check out each day etc, etc. They wouldn't even let us carry the umbrella and other items ..they have guys that go get the stuff for you, find enough chairs for your family, and then they set everything up for you. They will even watch your stuff if you have to run up to your room for a moment. There are sunbeds available everywhere, as well as other small beach chairs they will set up for your kids. All I can say is...WOW! Yes the rooms are very pricey, but we found the food to be MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE than other places on the island. This was especially true for room service, where we could get a kid's breakfast for only $10, and an Adult breakfast of eggs, bread, sausage or bacon, and potatoes for $17 (as opposed to $26 at Turtle Bay with no potatoes and no turkey options for meat, and no discount if you don't want the meat due to pork allergies). There are also FREE water stations with cups throughout the resort, and also by the pool, in the AWESOME and luxurious gym, in the spa, etc. (Compared to about $3 per bottle of water throughout the island, that is a huge money saver in itself). We travel to Disney World often, usually staying at the Yacht and Beach Club or Grand Floridian, so we are spoiled by the friendliness and welcoming nature of the staff at Disney Resorts. This property far surpassed that and we were pleasantly surprised. We were traveling with a 7 yr old and a VERY picky 3 yr old, and on 2 different occasions my 3 yr old decided she didn't like the food we ordered for her and the staff very graciously insisted on bringing her something else FREE of charge. (I was not a fan of her getting special treatment, as we teach out children to be grateful for what they have, but the staff insisted and I was amazed at how kind and generous they were). We did have a rental car because there are so many things to explore on Oahu, but once we got to Aulani we never left. We could have easily stayed there all 8 days without a car and found things to do each day. AUNTY'S BEACH HOUSE: Loved it! We have never trusted our children at a resort daycare in the past 15 vacations we've taken, but this place was amazingly safe, impeccably clean, and so fun they had to kick US out because we would have hung out with our kids there if they let us. Our kids never wanted to leave (and our 3 yr. old is going through separation anxiety, so it was a miraculous turnaround for her). My favorite parts were the GPS trackers they put on each child's arm every time they check in, the secret password you have to create to pick up your own child, the ABUNDANCE of friendly cast members in every room of the facility, the fact that every person has to wash their hands upon entry to the facility (adults and kids alike), and of course that CHIP and DALE stop by many times per day for sing alongs and special activities. And the most AMAZING part of all...it is completely FREE!!! We only left our kids for short amounts of time, but they allow you to leave them all day and you can just pay for lunch and/or dinner that you pick from their menu. They are also very conscious of food allergies, and I even saw kids being dropped off with their epi pens, so those parents obviously felt their kids were safe there as well! The lazy river was warm and a lot of fun for our whole family. And once again..the inner-tubes were FREE. The water park play area has smaller slides that adults can ride with their kids, and the giant volcano had large slides...one that my husband rode with our 7 yr old on a 2 person inner-tube(He was scared at first, but kept saying \"Again, Daddy\" after the first time!) As per other reviews, the grounds are truly beautiful. We stumbled upon the adult pool one day as we were leaving the spa, and it was in a very quiet and romantic area. Lots of things for people to do at this resort, from toddlers, to honeymooners, to grandparents. The water in the lagoon was calm and relaxing, and the beach was smooth and free of rocks. We ate at Makahiki for the character breakfast-around $130 for 4, plus $30 for the picture package we purchased, but the pictures were so good that they were worth the extra cost and the buffet had an awesome variety of foods. We also ate at Ama Ama for lunch and dinner and the food was very good and they were overly accommodating when it came to special requests. This was our favorite restaurant because they offer ocean front dining with the BEST sunset views you could ever hope for.

While staying at Hilton Hawaiian Village, I wore a couple Aulani shirts I'd bought, and I had no less than 10 Hilton employees rave about their visit to see it. The locals, as well, are clearly smitten. Sure, it's expensive. But you get what you pay for, and the new quick service food spot (Mama's) is opening this weekend (June 15), and that'll help a bit. I've stayed at or visited a ton of the large Resorts throughout the Caribbean, Hawaiian Islands, and the South Pacific. And whether you have kids or not, Aulani is right there with the very best of them.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "westchester NY", "Title": "\u201cAmazing, Hawaiian vacation\u201d", "Author": "VinnyG1031", "ReviewID": "UR131791186", "Content": "We are DVC owners so we couldnt wait to visit this resort. The minute you drive up the road and see this place you know it's special. We have stayed at many hotels on Hawaii, all were wonderful but none were as Hawaiian as this one. Yes it's a Disney property but it it's truly a beautiful Hawaiian style hotel and no one does detail like Disney and that makes it special. Yes there are Disney characters and touches of Disney around the hotel but they are very tasteful and if you are not a big Disney fan you may not even notice some of the things, an you too will enjoy this place. If you are a Disney fan then you will notice all the secret touches and have fun doing so. We have been to Hawaii many times so the seeing the sites were not a part of our plans, relaxing was and if you have never been to Hawaii you have to see the sites, but I have to say his resort has plenty to keep you busy. In fact it takes a few days just to find and discover all the things that go on here between the shows, entertainment and just the architecture . The hotel Is about 40 min from wiakiki so I suggest a car and when reading these post someone mentioned discounthawaiiancarrental.com and it was HALF of everywhere else we tried. The beach was wonderful, they don't charge for chairs, umbrellas and assorted beach toys, not something you get often at a Hawaiian resort! There are plenty of place to eat and more being added. The food was very good, we ate at the buffet and it was a little pricy but the food and selection was very enjoyable,as we're the lunch selections. Oh yeah two words.. Shave ice! If you go with your family this place is great fun, kids will have a ball! But like everything Disney does there is something for everyone and I think couples can enjoy this place just as much. As for the staff/cast member.... Everything you expect from a Disney staff/cast member is also here. You can not walk more the 20 feet without seeing a cast member who is ready to help or just wish you aloha. They go out of their way to help. Everyone from the front desk to the people taking care of the landscaping were friendly and helpful. They continue to improve this place and it will only get even better if that's possible.

All the positives written about this hotel is true so I won't elaborate, however, I would like to comment on the two negatives that everybody writes about.

I highly recommend you buy food items to keep in your room, because it is very pricey to eat at Aulani, and if you don't have a car, then you are stuck since there aren't many other dining choices in the area. There is a market, a taco place, a Hawaiian BBQ place, and an ice cream place across from the resort. The hotels in Ko Olina all have restaurants, and there is also Roy's restaurant but they are all very expensive. We did eat at Aulani's Amu Amu restaurant. It was very good, but very expensive. Aulani is on a private lagoon in Ko Olina. There is a beach walk that goes between Aulani and the 3 other lagoons and there is also a marina. Aualani has a lazy river pool, a snorkeling pool, water slide in the family pool, and there is also a quiet pool. We were there as a couple and there were alot of families so don't expect a quiet resort. Paradise Cove Luau is within walking distance and is pretty good (see my review). I recommend Aualni for families. As a couple, we did not enjoy any of the activities Aulani had to offer. I also recommend renting a car. Aulani is about 45 minutes from the airport, and Waikiki beach. Aualni offers excursions, but we did not do any because we rented a car.

The bell men, valet and lei welcome was so refreshing. Checking in was a bit long... but only because we couldn't wait to get out in the pools and ocean. We were in a 2 bdrm/2 1/2 bath room, 1 King with a massive bathroom/jacuzzi tub. Other bedroom was 2 Queens, both rooms very private and extremely comfortable. We each had our own balcony (a little on the small side) , with very comfortable chairs, and a very safe tall railing for little ones. We had a full kitchen, washer/dryer, soap included, with top of the line appliances and dishware. The maid service was top notch, very friendly, thorough and accommodating. One night we ordered their family meals, enough for 5 adults, delivered hot to our room. It was excellent. The grounds are fabulous, lazy river, numerous pools, fantastic pool attendants, and we felt so safe with our little one with a life guard at every turn and corner. Goofy and Mickey play in the pool at various times during the afternoons, with games for all ages of children. The lagoon side was also exceptional, lots of chairs and umbrellas, a sports center right on the beach to rent paddle boards, sand toys, etc. The restaurants served excellent food and drinks, a bit pricey, but it's Hawaii and a Disney Resort. There is a family Luau (no food) on certain nights, very fun and engaging, large grass mats are placed on their huge oceanfront lawn area, with lots of fun activities for the children to get involved in. We never had a hard time finding 5 pool chairs together, there were lots of empty chairs, and with the resort only being 2/3 complete, when full there still should be plenty of pool chairs.

I've stayed at many high end resorts (Polynesia, NY, Miami, Cannes and Paris, FR, Rome etc.)and have no problem paying top dollar for 5 star experiences. This was not one of them. Room was $800 a night for 2 seniors and one adult. My extended family of 2 adults and two kids, ages 2 and 4 were in the adjacent room. Basically what you're paying for is the characters walking through and waving here and there and paying for photos taken with them (bring a decent camera and take your own photos to save money) and a small 'river' where you can raft around in and a water slide..the novelty 'runs dry' after a couple of hours. The hotel grounds are nice and the lagoon is nice, but comparable to other nice hotels in the area that are way less money. The employees were helpful/friendly, but at times not organized..we were sent to 5 places once for a show..2 times to one place, 2 times to another and finally to a 5th location..each location the employees looked confused and were scrambling and making phone calls to see where the show was moved to..really frustrating and not something one should encounter at an expensive hotel. We had 2 lunches at the restaurant by the beach..food was good and nice size portions. The room's air fan which keeps the air circulating in the was really loud..maintenance was up quickly to disconnect it..both guys commented that it was loud. Rooms were of average size..small if you have 2 or more kids.. views were beautiful...like most views in Hawaii. Pool area is really small and cramped..so you'll be sitting/laying right next to someone.. Beach had more space.. All of the flaws would be excusable had the rooms not've been so outrageous.. Our group had two wheel chair bound seniors and 2 small children and they refused to extend our checkout. So we had 7 hours to do basically nothing until our flight left. The kids were tired of the water slide/river after the first day, and had their photos taken with the characters.. so we ate, and hung out in the TV game room until we had to leave.. 2 stars were given because the hotel did provide free wheelchairs. The grounds were nice. Employees were friendly and willing to help. Food was decent. Rooms appeared clean...all of which should be standard at any hotel. You get a typical Hawaii hotel stay for double the price..hence the poor rating. My advice is..book somewhere else for most of your Hawaii stay and if you really need the greedy overpriced Disney 'experience', book a night or two here. My 2 young nieces were bored on the 2nd day..which was fine because that all they stayed.. Our room stayed one night. My family would've extended our stay, had it been worth the money, unfortunately, it's not....

The property is lovely although on Oahu. We traveled to Maui and Kauai also, and they are more \"authentic\" Hawaii than Waikiki. Aulani is a wonderful property for families - lots for kids to do, safe beach for children (breakwaters control the surf even if surf beyond is rough) with supervision - there's no lifeguard here but lots of lifeguards at pool - waterslides, character meet and greets, character breakfasts, interactive toys, etc. Our only complaints were - the \"quiet pool\" is not reserved for adults only - during our stay there were kids there also, so we went to beach - this is NOT a resort for young couples in my opinion - there are a LOT of children understandably and I feel they would not enjoy the noise level. My husband and I are 50+, celebrating an anniversary and looking forward to grandchildren in a few years, so we find children charming again. The spa is a good escape but it is expensive for younger couples. The exception would be if the young couple were both Disney-philes. Then they'd probably love it. Staff is struggling still a little bit with the \"Disney\" way - the rest of Hawaii is very laid-back with regard to service (not as bad as France, but close) and Disney expects better, so you can see they are trying. One even told me they are still trying to \"figure it out\". It is a beautiful resort though with reasonable prices for the quality of food and drink and the resort atmosphere.

I was there with my family and we had a wonderful time. I've been to other Disney resorts and theme parks before. But, the people here were the most helpful and friendly of any Disney property I've ever visited. The resort is new and spotless. I would have given this resort five stars, but I found everything overpriced. Here are a few tips for those of you planing a trip out there: - They aren't kidding when they say you should make reservations for the Character Breakfast. Not only will you have a long wait (like we did) if you don't make reservations, but they don't have the Character Breakfast everyday and you don't want to disappoint the kids. - Luckily the food seems to have gotten a little better since some of the reviews were written. But, it still isn't great. For example, we had lunch at \"Off the Hook\" and found the Panini and Chicken Strips pretty good. But, the Angus burger was dry and a little cardboardy. - The Menehune Adventure Trail was a lot of fun for our pre-teen. But, the older kid and adults found the game a bit tedious. However, if you are looking for something to do when you first get there, it is one way to get acquainted with the resort. - As mentioned in other reviews, the $18.99 refillable mug is worth the price. Buy it once and you can refill it during your entire stay. There are a few beverage stations and the one at the Kalepa's Store has coffee, tea and hot chocolate. - For a resort, the fitness center is pretty good. There are cardio machines, some resistance machines and some dumbells. Also check the daily newsletter for other opportunities like the boot camp on the beach. - There aren't many places to eat. And you'll quickly learn that \"One Paddle, Two Paddle\" and \"Off the Hook\" have identical menus. If you don't have a car, there are a couple of restaurants in easy walking distance. If you have a car, you can drive about three miles to a shopping center which has Pizza Hut, Outback Steakhouse, McDonald's and more. - If you are a sucker for Mickey Mouse ice cream (like me). Go to Kalepa's Store and look at the bottom shelf of the freezer. They are easy to miss, but there you'll find Mickey Mouse popcicles and ice cream sandwiches!

The resort is beautiful!! The vibe is detailed Hawaiian culture and island feel, sprinkled with subtle touches of Disney. Yes, like everything Disney does it is very, very well done. We never felt like we were at a theme park, definitely felt like we were in Hawaii. The Menehue Bridge, Lazy River and pool provided hours of fun for my kids, not to mention the beach lagoon, which is so calm even my little ones could splash around without getting knocked down by big waves. The best Disney touch was Aunty's Beach House. My kids played there each morning and everything was clean, neat, and organized (a mother's dream!). I wish I had an Aunty's Beach House in my hometown! Again, Disney quality and it definitely shows that Disney has a large budget for these things (a dozen computers, top notch flat screens, and touch screen game tables throughout the beach house, plus every Disney dress up costume you can think of at kids height so they can play dress up at will). I also liked that each kid/adult upon entering the beach house had to wash their hands, very nice touch Disney! No one wants to get sick on vacation! My husband and I both got spa treaments at the Laniwai Spa and it was the nicest spa I have ever been to in the country! I travel a lot and spend a lot time in a hotels (a little bit of time in spas) and I was impressed. I felt very relaxed and the staff was great. I highly recommend making the splurge on your vacation. It was worth it. Movie night was good, but my daughter was not thrilled with the movie choice - can't please all 4 year olds, ha! The Starlit Hui was very nice. It was very much like a luau without the food and just the right length of time to keep the kids attention. We did the character breakfast which was good. The food was typical buffet food, but the characters came to each table and my daughter really loved the special attention she got from Minnie and Goofy. We got great pictures that morning of her with each character. I only have a few, very minor negatives - the rooms (standard with two kind beds) was not very child proof. Every outlet was exposed at child height and the beds are raised rather high to allow storage for your lugguage underneath. My kids are little, so of couse within 5 minutes my son found every outlet in the place to try to stick his finger in. Next time I might just pack some plug covers from home. Also, for the beds, if you have little ones ask for them to bring you some bed rails. They will provide them for you free of charge. Finally, the pool side lunch menu is priced okay (think average resort prices) but there are only five items on the menu and after 7 days the choices got old. I hope they add a few more options by the time we go back. The service was great though. Tips for your stay - buy the refillable cup ($18.99), sold at the resort. You get unlimited soft drinks and coffee throughout your stay at filling stations throughout the property, and you can keep the cup. It was worth it after the amount of drinks we would have bought during our stay. We bought one cup and shared it. Also, there are water stations throughout the restort with little disposable cups which is nice even if you don't buy the other cup. We ventured out a few times to eat outside the resort, because we got tired of the food onsite. Costco, Safeway, Target, McDonald's are just about 2 miles up the rode and if you feel really adventurous drive toward North Shore and grab lunch from a shrimp truck (we tried Macky's), we also tried Nico's in the Honolulu marina area which was featured on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\" - it was excellent. The drive either direction wasn't really that far. Also, visited the Dole Pineapple Plantation and Pearl Harbor, neither were a very far drive. Worth seeing, but we could have also very well stayed at the resort the entire time.

Rooms: comfortable, spacious and clean and we appreciated having the microwave and mini-fridge in our studio suite. Plenty of space to store luggage and bags. Food: kids loved the shave ice, but other than that we didn't try any of the onsite dining, we brought groceries instead. Activities: The pool areas were incredible (waterslides, lazy river, water jungle area, many hot tubs), and we were happy they stayed open until 8pm, and the main pool until 10pm. The evening lighting was beautiful and relaxing. It was sometimes difficult to find lounge chairs, but note that the staff do regular checks and will remove items from chairs if they aren't used in an hour. Be sure to attend the free evening show, the performances were beautiful, and the kids enjoyed making the crafts and seeing their Disney friends at the end. The activity that my girls (& I!) absolutely enjoyed was the Menehune game/hunt. If you play it near the beginning of your stay, its a good way to learn your way around the resort. We didn't have the time to experience the snorkel lagoon, or the stingray pool but they were very popular. The beach/lagoon is also nice and showers are available when you re-enter the Aulani. Parking: pricey, $35, but DVC members receive free parking. Staff: Almost everyone was smiling, greeted you with an Aloha, and really made you feel welcomed. Surprisingly, we didn't find this to be the case when we registered our girls in Auntys Beach House. Perhaps the staff can try to be friendlier and make the children feel more welcome. On our past Disney cruises our daughters have always enjoyed the kids club, so this was a disappointment. Other: The day lounge and shower facilities are the best! After checking out, we stayed at the resort for the rest of the day and were able to freshen up before leaving for our flight. Overall, we found this resort pricey but worth it, and we'd love to go back again. If you want to explore the island more, I would suggest you stay for a longer time, or divide your stay with another hotel that isn't as nice. Aulani was so comfortable and relaxing, we didn't want to leave the resort!", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, Ca", "Title": "\u201cMUST READ THIS REVIEW FOR THE REAL SCOOP!\u201d", "Author": "Jason S", "ReviewID": "UR131043022", "Content": "What an amazing place! My wife and 6 year old daughter just spent 6 days there. We had a tremendous time. If you are looking for typical Disney, then this is not the place. If you are looking for a beautiful new resort in Hawaii that has a touch of Disney and great fun for the kids, then this is the place\u2026 Having been to Hawaii many times, I can say that this is one of the most beautiful resorts around. Exceptionally clean, lush grounds, incredible amenities and rooms; all perfect. We stayed in the 1 bedroom villa so we could have privacy at night and not be watching TV in the same area while my daughter tried to sleep. The room was huge, immaculate, and had a full size, completely stocked with essentials kitchen. Two balconies, a sofa sleeper (did not use) and a cute trundle bed, that my daughter loved. Great rain shower head, Jacuzzi bath tub, and nice big TV\u2019s (note here\u2026 There are no PPV channels for renting movies, but movies are available to rent on DVD in the resort store, or bring your own). Let me break down our stay in simple pros and cons for your consideration: PROS: 1. Great pools, slides, and immaculate, lush, beautiful pool area. Many, many lifeguards for all areas so we felt safe to allow our daughter to go into all pools and lazy river with just a newly found friend. 2. 1 bedroom villa was flawless and worth the extra $$ 3. Plenty of activities for kids and most are free! Luau\u2019s, movie\u2019s on the lawn at night, pool parties, dance parties, character visits (with short lines), Auntie\u2019s playhouse, treasure hunts, fireside story and music times, etc\u2026 4. Hotel and lobby are gorgeous 5. People are amazing. They learn your names, ask if you need anything, and constantly offer a warm aloha, quick to help, seem to enjoy their job. 6. Stingray activity is well worth the money. 7. Beach is great for kids (clean and safe with no waves). 8. No problem finding chairs at pool or the beach. 9. Incredible views from hot tubs. 10. Great service (like a Ritz Carlton in terms of service and attention to detail)! CONS: 1. JUST ONE!! Food was expensive and hit or miss. However, it is Hawaii AND Disney AND you are on vacation so don\u2019t be a cheap ***. This was to be expected at the resort. Stick with seafood as much as possible. Ceviche, shellfish, and seafood entr\u00e9e\u2019s at Ama Ama were great. Beef was not good. Had a dry/tough hamburger and an overcooked steak. Pool menu was limited, but decent. Food across the street was also just okay, but there was an ABC market to buy provisions for the room. Also, just down the road was Roy\u2019s (cheaper AND better than Ama Ama, fine dining restaurant in resort). If you rent a car, head to the north shore for Cholla\u2019s (good Mexican) and the shrimp trucks (located just past Turtle Bay Resort and a little sketchy looking, but very good and the FRESHEST shrimp you can find {as they harvest directly from farm ponds right behind the stand}). HINTS: 1. Do rent a car. Restaurants on resort are not easy to get into and food is okay. Within a five minute drive, there is: Costco, Red Brick Pizza very good), MANY other fast food and other shopping (Sports Authority, K Mart, etc\u2026). Plus North Shore is an easy 45 minute drive and beautifully lush compared to drier resort area. 2. Do valet park. EXACT same $35 as self park, but you drop car off at lobby rather than searching for a parking spot and then walking from the parking structure. 3. Bring own DVD\u2019s. 4. Buy the $18 souvenir cup. Yes, not cheap, but you get unlimited refills (including Kona coffee) during your stay. 5. Make any dinner or breakfast reservations you desire at the resort, a few weeks BEFORE you get there. If still getting late times for dinner a few weeks out, check back a few days ahead and they seem to release some more times. That is when I finally got my times. Again, stick with seafood! 6. Do bring a blanket and pillows to sit/lay on when going to movie night as the ground gets hard for the adults!", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "hi", "Title": "\u201cSuperb!\u201d", "Author": "bambaana", "ReviewID": "UR130987018", "Content": "This was our 2nd stay here.

If going to Hawaii and you enjoy Disney, this is the place. 1.) We are DVC members-One bedroom Villa~Amazing and very clean~ If you are thinking about utilizing you points for a trip here-DO IT!! You get great perks: Free parking, check-in online, and a book of perks you receive on arrival. Also, the value of a DVC is outstanding. If you are going to keep going back, think about becoming a member. Worth It~ 2.) Disney Photo Pass~ Disney has photographers all around the resort to take pictures for special events or at different places. You can buy the CD after your visit of all your pictures for $99.00. One guest we were behind, had over 400 pictures on it. Check at the store to find out were they are taking pictures. Try the sunset picture taking. Great memories. 3.) Food~ So many have written about it, thus, I will be short, We made a lot of meals at the resort. There is a Safeway not to far, thus, we were able to get nice fresh food. We like to travel like that, thus, DVC works for us. We did have a killer \"meat lovers\" pizza there. 4.) Spa~ Expensive, but, such a treat~ Would highly recommend booking prior to your arrival. We request to have ours in the Cabanas. We enjoyed it. (ask when booking for that option. Also, they keep the Cabana open unless asked to close it. I opted for the walls to be closed~) 5.) Did the Stingray perserve~ Excellent~ Small group and lots of fun. Would HIGHLY recommend. 6) I recommend a car, thus, you are not limited to just this resort. We went to Honolulu and explored the Island. Was well worth it. (We liked this part of the Island that Disney is located on, relaxing and quiet.) 7.) If you just want to stay here, you will not be bored. You will always find something to do..Maybe even just relax :-). Disney does a wonderful job at providing a lot of options for all. Alittle planning before you go is highly recommend, especially if you have children. We don't have children and we found lots to do there. 8.) Please remember that this is a Disney resort in Hawaii. You are not getting Disneyland or Disneyworld, however, a fun Disney experience with wonderful Disney hospitality, amenities, and Mickey~ Glad we were able to visit this delightful resort~", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cLove the Aulani!\u201d", "Author": "DebB818", "ReviewID": "UR130893431", "Content": "I stayed at the Aulani for 6 nights in December with my family of 5. Me, my husband and our three children, ages 21, 19, and 17. We rented a car, which I recommend if you are interested in seeing the sights on Oahu or going out to eat in Waikiki. There is quite a bit of traffic on the highway from the Aulani to Waikiki but if you time your drive correctly you can make it there in about 30 minutes. The arrival to the hotel was as you would expect from a Disney property. We recieved a very warm welcome and the lobby is spectacular. We were promptly checked-in and taken to our rooms. We were in partial ocean view rooms but from our balcony we had a full view of the ocean with the Mariott and additional views of the ocean off to the side. Beautiful! Overall the service was excellent however, at the time the hotel had only been open for a few months and it was easy to tell which employees had worked for Disney before and which were new. Hopefully everyone has gotten with the program and can interact with the guests with that Disney flair that we have been accustomed to. The beach is wonderful although rentals are a bit pricey. Which brings me to the costs involved at staying at the Aulani. Yes, it is very pricey. Especially for a family dining there for 3 meals a day. Do not go to the hotel and expect a bargain. This is for families wanting a luxury experience in Hawaii which will always be expensive. If you want to save money, make snacks and sandwiches in the room. There is a small market across the street. There are not many choices for eating out of the hotel in the area. I think the Disney experience in Hawaii is worth it. There are plenty of activities especially for families with young children. The pool area alone can keep them busy for hours! The slides are great as is the lazy river. Don't miss the Shave Ice shack near the pool! Mickey and friends make their appearances but it is definitely not all about the characters. The kids will love every moment of their stay! Don't miss the Mehune Trail, which is fun for all ages.

We are DVC members and stayed in a one bedroom unit with an ocean view - worth every point we used. Everything about it was perfect and I can't think of one thing that I would change. I had been reading Aulani reviews for several months prior to our trip and was very concerned about meals since so many people gave less than favorable reviews. My daughter is vegan and also has many food allergies so we headed to Whole Foods and stocked up our kitchen. On our 3rd day there I stopped by Ama Ama out of curiosity. Not only did we just walk in, and did this several times during our stay, but the food and service were amazing. Since my daughter has so many food allergies, Chef Kevin came out and talked to her each time. Even though she initially did not want to try Ama Ama, this became our favorite place to eat lunch. We only ate there for lunch, not dinner, and I found the cost to be very reasonable especially considering the awesome view. My daughter and I loved the veggie sandwich, husband liked the fish tacos and I also had a nice salad with grilled Mahi Mahi. The desserts were wonderful and pieces of art. We also tried Makahiki for dinner and ordered off of their a la carte menu. Once again the chef came out and asked my daughter what she would like. He created an unforgettable meal just for her. It doesn't get any better than that. Again, our meal was well worth the money. I would definitely recommend going off season if at all possible. We never waited for a chair on the beach, for a table at lunch or dinner or to have our picture taken with one of the Disney characters.

First of all, the hotel is in the Ko'olina neighborhood about 30 minutes (depending on traffic) from Honololu on the west side of the island. I mention this, because there's NOTHING to do outside the hotel within walking distance. One grocery store, which I'll talk about later and 2restaurants.

Everything from the kitchen to the livingroom to the bedrooms was top notch. The hotel itself is amazing. Disney made an amazing job in giving you the Hawaiian experience without making it seem fake (like Disney tends to do) From the lobby to the pool area, to the beach, you feel like you're in paradise. The best part of the hotel was the beach. The hotel is in a private cove which they share with the JW Marriott next door. Its perfect for snorkeling as the water is crystal clear. The only restaurant we tried was the Ama Ama which is right on the beach. The breakfasts are amazing and the views to as well. The customer service, as you might expect, is perfect. Everyone is with a constant smile and greeting you Aloha all the time. This is Hawaii, and this is a top notch resort, and MORE IMPORTANTLY, this is Disney, so be ready for high prices. I would recommend crossing the street to the ABC Store and buying stuff for your breakfasts and snacks. This will save you a bundle. They have everything you might need including masks and snorkles so you dont rent the ones at the hotel. Tip: I would totally recommend eating at Roys. Its Hawaiian/Asian fusion and its amazing.

As a group we had two DVC villas and a studio. The trip will forever stay with me and I would go again in a heart beat. It's spendy but it's worth it. Disney knows what they are doing create a truly magical experience. Rooms: My husband and I stayed in the studio with a pool view. I thought the room was very nicely decorated and clean. We had fun spotting little disney touches in the d\u00e9cor. But the best part was the bed. Oh my was it cozy!! I also like that the bed is raised up from the ground. My only complaint was the lighting in the room. It was a bit too dark, even in the bathroom. I found that my family did not have this same problem so it could be only in the studios. Their rooms by the way were wonderfully spacious with a full size kitchen. Both villas had ocean view rooms on the 11th floor. The view was spectacular of both the resort and the ocean! I recommend asking for at minimum a pool view...otherwise you may end up looking at a parking garage or convention area. Food: OK...YES the food is expensive, but that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise considering you are in Hawaii and on a Disney resort. We had dinner at Makahiki. Both my husband and I had the buffet while the rest of the family had an entre. The buffet was just OK. Overpriced for what it was and my family stated that the food was kind of bland. The restaurant itself was beautiful, it just didn't impress us food wise. We actually only ate there the one time and had the remainder of our meals at Ama Ama, off the hook or off site. Now we were REALLY impressed with Ama Ama. The staff there were great, the food was super tasty and the view and open air seating was a refreshing. We had both breakfast and dinner here. It's pricey but we felt our money was well spent there. We had a burger at Off the Hook and it was OK...a bit pricey for what it was. We also ate offsite at the taco and hawaiin BBQ place across the street. Go to Just Tacos! Really yummy stuff there at fair prices. The gem we found was just up the Hwy by Target...a vegetarian and organic food market. We stopped there (as well as Costco) for our breakfast and snack foods. We ate breakfast 5 out of 7 days on our porch. It made for a very relaxing morning. I recommend picking up guava juice and champagne (mimosa) for a yummy morning treat. The only snacks we had on site were rip swirl yogurt cups (good but pricey!) and a mickey premium bar (how can you not!?). We did not take advantage of the $18 refillable cups only because we aren't soda drinkers. But our cousins loved them. Beach & Pools: We loved walking the path along the beach. The beach is great because you aren't fighting large waves and the water is so clear you can see fish with out even snorkeling! We did not rent anything as we thought the fees were a bit steep. The Pools and the slides were so much fun. The place is like a mini water park. We had no problem finding chairs but then again we liked being away from the crowds. Chairs along the pool edge were almost always taken at the height of the day. We had the run of the place in the mornings and evenings when we preferred to swim. The water slides are a must to try even for adults! We do wish they would make edgeless hot tubs adult only. It was such a romantic spot and was almost always filled with kids using them as a mini pool. **If you walk to the end of the beach path (turn right from aulani) you'll find some great tide pools. We had fun exploring those and seeing crabs & fish. It's also a great spot to watch the sunset. **walk all the way to the other end (by the marina) and you'll see a pirate ship! We are pretty sure it's a prop from one of the pirate movies. Spa: If you can afford it, do it!! It's so well worth the money. We spent over three hours in the spa area after our AMAZING couples massage!! If you want to get away from the pool chaos you can spend $45 to only use the hot tubs/garden area for the day. Other: **My husband and I are in our 30's and we still had fun doing the Menehune trail on our own. They had a bit of connectivity issues but promised they were working on those. **The Characters were out every day so we didn't have to go to the character breakfast to see them. They WILL take pictures with your camera if you wish. I still bought a few off of the photopass because they were better than what my camera could have taken. **We wish we knew this earlier..you can do the art walk on your own!! Just visit the community hall. You don't have to do it at the scheduled time. ***Spend some time in the lobby. We read there a couple times on the big comfy couches. The breeze through the lobby is so wonderful and it really is beautiful. **We bought a kite at Target and had a blast flying it in the empty field next to Aulani. Entertainment that cost us quite a bit less than any of the beach rentals. **Go early to the Hui there are tons of activities that the kids will love . If you don't have kids snag a spot before hand at the bar. You get a great view and a drink in hand. Overall GREAT stay. I'd love to visit again. We did go off property quite a bit and were thankful we had the rental car. It is $35 a day to park but free if you are a DVC member. Nearby there is a Target, Costco, Organic Food Market, Starbucks, Ross, Denny's\u2026 We also HAD to see the rest of the beautiful island.

We arrived in early afternoon and decided to rest a bit after we checked in. After I got up, I glanced out the window (without glasses) and saw what I thought was a sailboat suddenly disappear. I grabbed up my glasses and realized I was seeing whales! WHALES! From my room! It was amazing! The rooms are super nice and well appointed (keep looking for Hidden Mickeys - they are there!) We took a DVC tour to see the other room options and were very impressed. The pool areas were amazing as well - I could have spent the whole week just floating around the lazy river! There were life guards all along the river pool - when one was out of your sight the next one was there. Very safe for kids (although we went kidless!) Although this is a Disney resort, it is not character heavy - they just have a few key characters an ample time to see them if you choose. At Disneyland & Disney World, you can't get close to the main characters - Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy- they are always swamped (and as an adult, I feel I should let the kiddies see them first, dang it!), but here there wasn't a huge rush and I didn't feel like I was keeping kids away by having my photo taken with a character. There were a lot of activities for families and just adults - excursions, movies, etc. and it was all fun We particularly enjoyed sitting on the lawn and watching a movie and the Hui was fun, too! We booked an excursion as well - the catamaran whale watching/snorkeling adventure and it was a wonderful trip! It costs extra and you should book in advance if you can. The resort is fairly close to the Honolulu airport - about 30 minutes away - so you have a good jumping off point for other island adventures (and you can rent a car right in the lobby!) My only complaint was the expense of the restaurants. The place that was supposed to be more \"family friendly\" was a flat rate buffet which was very pricey, but I understand they changed that so you can get ala cart items now (yay!) We discovered the ABC store (as first timers, this was new) and bought a lot of our meals there - probably saved $600 on food that way and it is just a couple blocks away - an easy walk. The DVC tour guide told us about it and we were very grateful! Ama Ama was very expensive for dinner, but breakfast was reasonable, so we ate a few times there - excellent waffles with coconut syrup! Pour a little of the syrup in your mocha and that is a bit of heaven! The other eateries were \"bars\" near the pools and the appetizers were substantial enough for a meal when we decided Ama Ama was too expensive for dinner. We also grabbed lunch a few times near the pools and the food was good. One of the best things we did was buy one of the Aulani thermal travel mugs at the resort store - you could get free fountain drinks from any of the drink stations for the duration of your stay. It included sodas, tea (iced or hot), lemonade and coffee - plus ice - so that purchase is well worth it.

Several drawbacks due to the HC accessible room; bed is lower with no under bed storage; counters lower and no microwave; turning radius requirements for wheelchairs mean the bahroom is huge but it comes at the cost of cramping the sleeping/living area.

There's also a quiet pool with bar if you'd like to get away from the kids. The landscaping is drop dead gorgeous. Lots of things to do around the resort. Ko Olena resort area is quiet compared to the craziness of Honolulu area. Food was great although it was a little pricey even by Hawaii standards. Avoid the continental breakfast at the 'Oleo bar; overpriced, stale, dried out begels. Have an Omelet or Eggs Benedict at the 'Ama Ama restaurant overlooking the Ocean instead. Portions are huge. We ate at every restaurant. The buffets at Makahiki were great. The meals at 'Ama 'Ama (two breakfasts and a dinner) were also fantastic. Views from the restaurant are awesome especially the dinner when we watched the sun go down. Staff was friendly...greeted us by name when we pulled up to the resort. Gave us our leis and it was off to the room as we'd checked in on-line. Gardener pointed out hidden sculptures in the volacano at the pool/lazy river area. We accidenty left stuff in our room and they packed it up and shipped it to us...no charge...

Tips: -Ask Aulani for the name of the designated taxi service (for $55 price) to the hotel. Otherwise, you will be charged ~$80-100 for the ride to the hotel. -If you don't want to pay resort prices for food, then go across the street to the Island (ABC) market for fruit, pastries, pizza, paninis, sandwiches, drinks, etc. and stock up your fridge. Everyone does it. -Check schedule for character greetings. In 2 days, we took pics and played in different activities with Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy. No line to be with them like at Dland and the kids LOVED it. -Take advantage of Aunty's house for daycare and activities. Check out schedule and the \"open house\" before 10am to see if your kids like it. Nice break so that adults can go the spa or hang out on their own for dinner or laying out w/o the kids. -Walk around the 2-3 mile strip on the coast. Not on the beach but it's a nice paved walk. -Get the GPS for the different trails for the kids. They'll love seeing the different things inside and outside the resort buildings come to life.

No rain for 7 straight days, sunny to most sunny the entire time. Aulani is a fantastic resort. My review is lengthy so thhe summary up front - rent a car, eat at Highway Inn, Helena's, Ono's, and Max's. Poke is pretty much great at the restaurants and the groceries. Partial view Parlor suite is great, better than ocean view standard room. Use Aunties if you have small kids. Food is good and same price as Disney World. Gym is great but the ocean trail extends beyond the resort and provides a fantastic view. We originally booked an ocean view standard room but had the opportunity to upgrade to a partial ocean view parlor suite. I am glad we did. With 2 little kids (4 and 6), the extra room gave my wife and I privacy and space to relax. The small 4 person table, fridge, sink, and microwave (available on request) allowed us to save a little on food and enjoy left overs from some of the local restaurants. The suite has 1.5 baths. So, the kids had their own room and bathroom at night. The master bath was great. The shower had a rain shower option. The tub had a whirlpool. The icing on the cake was the Toto \"super loo\" with heated seats, adjustable bidet with warm water and dryer. Our partial ocean view was great. We were in the Wai'anae tower, on the north side. True, we overlooked the parking garage, but from the 12th floor, it wasn't an issue. For us, it beat the pool view. Some of the ocean view rooms from this tower looked like they would have views obstructed by the Marriott next story. A note of caution for those that like quiet, we could hear traffic noise from our balcony, but not in the room. Also, be careful of the ocean view rooms in this tower, there is a garden at the end where they do events during the day and some evenings but they all end before 10pm. The pools, hot tubs, lazy river, and slides are great. We slipped into a routine of the beach first thing in the morning and the pools, river, and slides in the early noon, followed by the kids play area and then off to Auntie's House by mid afternoon. The slides and river get \"crowded\" around 1130 to about 2 pm. Then they seemed to empty out. The only issue we had during this time frame was finding double tubs to take the kids down one of the slide with us. In between we'd visit the hot tub by the river and the 2 level infinity hot tub by the beach. Kids are allowed in the hot tubs which was awesome because it allowed the kids to warm up. It was a little windy, so they'd get cold. The tubs were very warm and comfortable (even hotter if you have sunburn) for us and the kids. Aunties House was fantastic. You can check your kids in from 10 am to 10 pm. They can eat lunch/dinner there if you order/pay in advance. Except for a couple nights, our kids ate dinner there. They loved the place. After they had their fill of the water/beach they'd ask us if they could go to Aunties to play and eat supper. We were more than happy to oblige. We were kid free almost every day for 5-6 hours to enjoy ourselves by the water and at dinner. The food at the resort is good, pricey, but not any more so than Disney restaurants. We had the catch of the day for dinner at Ama Ama. It was delicious. We did the buffet (can't remember the name) for dinner. It was good as well. We did the character breakfast at 7 am our second day. Since we were still on East coast time, waking up at 5-6am, it wasn't a problem for the kids. They loved it. It was less crowed than the ones at Disney world so they got more than enough time with Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy. Plus, Auntie was there and lead the typical sing along parade with the kids and character. The only dinning issue we had was at the pool side bar/restaurant Off the Hook. During the peak lunch and evening hours they were understaffed with only 2 waiters/waitresses for about 20 tables. The staff is excellent, but just not enough of them, so we had to be patient. If you are staying long or like to do off resort activities rent a car. It's $55 flat for a cab ride outside the resort and about the same for shuttle service to/from the airport. I read that Alamo had cars available for $35/day. We should have tried to reserve before hand because they were out of cars on first full day. Also, we were looking at rate of ~$60/day. Since we had some off resort activities and dinning planned, we ended up renting a car from Advantage (Nissan Sentra - $325 for 7 days, gas, car seat, taxes) and sucking up the $35/day parking. In the end, the flexibility it added to our vacation and to our dinning options was well worth it. We ate at some delicious local Hawaiian restaurants - Highway Inn in Waipahu and Helena's in Honolulu (Ono's in Waikiki is in the same league as these, but we didn't go there this trip) . We went during the mid afternoon, so there were no lines. If you like Filipino food, Waipahu has a large Filipino population. We went to Max's of Manila. They have some restaurants on the mainland but none in the DC area. I'm not a Filipino food expert, but my wife is Filipino and she loves Max's. So do I. Apparently, so do other folks. We got there 10 minutes after it was open and had to wait. There were other local Filipino restaurants but we didn't try them. Tried to exercise off some of the food. The gym was great. 5-6 each of treadmills, bike machines, ellipticals. Some free weights and machines. What I didn't realize at first is there is about 1.25 of paved trail on the beach that extends past the resort. So, I ditched the treadmill and enjoyed the ocean view. If you start at the Marriott end and run the Marina and back and through a loop in of the resort area rode, you can get a good 5 mile circuit in.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Lyon, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cStunning!!\u201d", "Author": "ShannonB1014", "ReviewID": "UR130133727", "Content": "Ok, first of all, call ahead to Aulani if you need a taxi at the aiport.

He charged us $85 one way to the hotel. Then he argued with my husband b/c he could not get his ccard machine to work. When we arrived, we were greeted by name and given Lei's along with water. It was so nice! They gave us a brief description of hotel (which was stunning) and sent our luggage up to our room. We are Disney Vacation Club members so we had the Emu tower. We had a one bedroom villa with a full kitchen, washer/dryer and a double balcony. Our room was absolutely amazing with granite, stainless steel appliances, a garden tub, plasma's, etc.. I did not enjoy our view much. It said garden view but it was more like, mountain, road and factory view. They were finishing the final wing of the resort right next to our room but the construction mess and noise was minimal. The grounds are absolutely breathtaking and spotless! Every employee was super friendly and always asking if we needed anything. Our favorite spot to grab chairs was near the hot tub in the middle of the lazy river. It was like having our own lagoon. Poolside service was great, a sandwich/fries will run you $10. Ama Ama was very good but very pricey. We decided to skip the other restaurants b/c of price and walked to the Market/ABC Store across the street from the resort and bought groceries/alcohol. Just Taco's across the street was pretty good to eat at. The Spa had some hiccups but nonetheless was beautiful and the manager took care of all my issues. The snorkel lagoon was really cool as was the stingray pool. The nightly entertainment was great for kids but we didn't bring ours so we skipped it. We rented a paddleboard ($30) and a kayak ($20) in the lagoon and that was pretty fun but small area to ride in. One night we even got to watch a free concert by Lifehouse right on the beach.

We did have problems with our room keys several times and a cab back to the airport but the employees are very quick to remedy any situation. They were all very nice and polite.

The resort has alot to experience: a great beach with calm waters, beautiful rooms to stay in, helpful staff, water slides, pools, lazy river to float in, best kids club I've ever seen, snorkeling with tropical fish, and fun disney characters. First of all, we rented a car and that was very nice for us. We went and bought food and were able to go to restaurants outside the resort. The food at the resort is limited and expensive but we did not want that to ruin our vacation. With low expectations and the ability to go anywhere to get food, we were very happy with this decision. We did go to the local markets/stores to get whatever we wanted and there are many stores near by. We got a villa with a kitchen so that also helped us. We made our meals most of the time and stocked drinks and ice cream in the frig. We bought a bunch of snacks to munch on by the beach or by the pools. We even got popcorn to go with the outdoor movie night on the lawn. The kids had a great time at the waterpark, pools, water slides, etc. Resort has free life jacket that you can borrow which is a nice touch. They also provide sand toys free of charge so the kids can build nice big sand castles on the beach. The aunty's beach house is huge with play room, movies room, and game room. There are also fun activities for the kids and dance party for the little ones. The staff there is ever so helpful and the kids really loved it. All the pool areas are clean and nice. I see staff cleaning the pool areas all the time. Life guards are everywhere watching over us and I felt very safe for my kids. There are so many staff members walking around helping guests or just saying hi when you walk by. The water slides are so much fun everyone one should try it at least once. The infinity hot tub gets the best view of the beach and a good hanging out place at the end of the day. The beach is nice with very tranquil waters so the kids have no problems swimming in the ocean. The website said they are charging $20 for an umbrella a day but when I was there, it was free to rent as a promotion until indefinetely. You have to go up to the rental staff and they will dig a hole in the sand next to your chair and place the umbrella for you. There are alot of nonmotorized water craft for rent also. When we were there for 5 days, there were at least two weddings a day and private conferences/functions throughout the resort. The kids club was closed one day for a private party so our kids couldn't be dropped off. (good thing we did not have an adult only excursion booked otherwise we would be lost without a babysiter). The infinity pool was closed one morning for a small wedding. 2/3 of the beach was closed one day for a private concert so we had to move all the way to the left side of the lagoon. It took them three days to build the huge concert stage that the sound of construction was annoying if you are on the beach. There were so many private events happening that the resort is closed off here and there daily which was somewhat inconvenient for the hotel paying guests. We felt like disney should have held these private events in designated areas and not in the public areas. This was the reason for four stars and not five. The vacation would have been \"perfect\" if it is not for the noise and the closed off areas that we couldn't use while there. I did hear from one staff that they do these functions all the time so something to be mindful if you ever decide to go there. We will definetely return to Aulani in the future.

Plenty of poolside lounge chairs available all day long. Prices of just about everything were what I've come to expect in Hawaii from all my previous trips. My negatives have to do with it being too Disney and too child oriented in places. Lots of screaming toddlers. Ama Ama had little kids running and screaming through the restaurant at 8:00 pm. Crying babies all day long poolside plus Disney characters in the afternoons loudly entertaining at the pool. This is a DISNEY RESORT, so this is to be expected. But why anyone would even want to visit Hawaii with toddlers and infants is a question. Hawaii is more than a hotel beach resort. What is the point of flying a minimum of 5 hours from the mainland to spend the time in a hotel? The beach lagoon is perfect-- but too perfect. It's like a sand-bottomed pool. Hardly any waves, absolutely no rocks, turquoise water, no imperfections of a natural beach. I loved it. But I've been to Hawaii countless times. I've hiked and explored and driven all over these islands and I love just being here but I know what is beyond the Disney magic.

It was definitely worth the points and the trip! We'd been looking forward to it for a long time. Aulani is beautifully done, with Hawaii history and lore woven into the architecture and the decor throughout. It is very like the Wilderness Lodge or the Animal Kingdom Lodge at Disneyworld, but much better done. We were greeted with Lei's, and with fruit flavored water -- the staff is very friendly, relaxed, and go out of their way to greet you and make you feel at home. We had an ocean view room on the 9th floor -- a two bedroom with two balconies, and we loved the view. The master bedroom had an incredible shower. The two bedroom has a full kitchen and washer/dryer -- all of which we used. (The oven smoked at pizza temperature, but other than that and wishing for a pizza cutter it had everything you really need!) The pool area is lovely, with a great lazy river. We never did the slide, though it looked like a LOT of fun, our teenagers now being too cool for water features. They enjoyed the ocean lagoon much more, as well as walking along the waterfront. Watching the sunset from the beach is incredible. The snorkeling area is fascinating...great for the younger than teen crowd. I only have two complaints about the Aulani. The first is that new guests, having checked in and needing to move their car to self parking for the first time don't know where they're going. They go blasting through the intersection where other guests are turning into the driveway -- the landscaping hides the turn in from the street from them. It's an accident waiting to happen, and who wants a fender bender (or worse) with a rental car? Stick a yield sign next to that Self-parking sign Disney please! The second is the lack of food choices. The poolside bar has a limited menu -- fine for the chicken finger set, but boring after the first meal.. The buffet is just a little too pricey; those of our party who tried it felt it was okay, but not fabulous. You can order ala carte, but none of us liked our order particularly. There's also the really fancy place on the waterfront, which we did not try. We expected the mini cafeteria typical of Disney hotels...a place where any family can go to find a simple comfort food kind of meal quickly -- hopefully they'll add that next. Luckily for us, Costco was one exit down the highway (if you're not a member and you're going to have a unit with a kitchen, think about joining!) -- we stocked up on pizza, fruit, cheese and crackers, cereal and milk, milk, milk (we have teenagers after all) -- all much less expensive than in the store downstairs. (Costco also a great place to buy gas for the rental car) There's also an Outback and a Target at that exit. There are other restaurants at the other resorts within easy walking distance -- I mostly heard other guests recommending the fish taco place across the street, saying that was good.

When we first arrived, they had a problem with our reservation but they immediately rectified it and upgraded us to a room that was double the price. We were very grateful for this. We ate several times in the restaurant and everyone was very hospitable. While we loved the resort, I was slightly disspointed because I thought there would be more \"Disney\" to the resort. It did not feel that we were in a Disney resort, other than having the characters around 2 times a day for specified times of 10-15 minutes. One suggestion I would make would be to try to have more activities with the characters and also increase the numbers of characters- we only saw Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, and Stitch. While I know we are not in Disney, it would have been nice not to see the same 4 characters. In terms of food, it was very good but very expensive. There needs to be a more \"kid-friendly\" and less expensive restaurant. Otherwise, we had a great trip.

The hotel is undeniably beautiful with woodland feel. From the moment you drive up and see the hotel from a distance to the dazzling lobby you just feel wow'd by the experience. The cast members quickly speak with your family and ensure the kids get extra attention while checking you in. You'll receive a quaint history lesson about the hotel too. The accommodations we stayed in was a three bedroom, three bathroom villa which felt like a palace! Unreal!! The rooms are spacious and you could have fit so many extra sleepers comfortably. Dining area, living room, four or five sliding glass doors to enjoy the ocean views. The kitchen was stylish with a luxe feel, the balcony went on forever with over ten chairs and loungers to enjoy the most amazing views of the grounds and ocean. The pools were creative with slides for children of all ages, the lazy river took us about 13-15 minutes to relax and enjoy, the kiddie park/pool I can hardly describe, had so many things to do my kids ages four and five never wanted to come out. You have to see this one for yourself! The activities are endless and Disney came up with a unique way to explore the grounds in an interactive way, the kids will enjoy a volcano to watching the most colorful tropical fish swim in a tank that they can view through a tank glass or go in with them!! Either way it's fantastic! The poolside service was excellent and the show for the guests is precious. The kids can make crafts prior to watching it, learn to hula, and play the hand crafted instruments taught by a cast member. Oh by the way the character breakfast is a must!! The kids will catch some fish with Goofy, dance with Minnie, and conga with Auntie during breakfast! It's all there!

I had an absolutely wonderful time at the Aulani. Every last detail is thought of as you would expect from Disney. However, I have outlined some things that could be improved. Keep in mind, this resort is not even a year old yet so they are still ironing out some kinks. The rooms are beautifully designed, and even the chocolate they leave you is top notch. (which I found out is Ewald Notter http://nakedchocolat.com/about/the-notter-school/) The lazy river is wonderful, the pools and infinity whirlpools were fantastic. The spa. I can't say anything other than you MUST go to the spa. We paid $150 for a massage. However, that gives you access to the entire spa for the rest of the day. They had two soaking pools, rain showers, a 45 degree plunge and a whirlpool. In addition, it is all outside so you can lay out in the sun and relax or have lunch. Then you can finish off the day with a shower and they have everything you need so no need to bring anything if you don't want to. (they provide, brushes, flat irons, hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, razors, etc.) The robes are to die for. I actually bought one. My one criticism of the spa was I went in to get a Lomi Lomi massage because I wanted to try something different. Unfortunately, my massage therapist did not do that. He basically just gave me a Swedish massage and by the time I realized there was nothing more to it, it was too late. That being said it was a really good Swedish massage. We stayed there for about 6 hours. We ate there 3 times. We went to the character breakfast buffet at Makahiki as well as the dinner buffet. Both were phenomenal, and as expected Ama Ama was fantastic as well. Yes they are really expensive. However, it was worth it to splurge given the fact that we had gone grocery shopping and took advantage of the kitchen and made a lot of our other meals. I took advantage of the beach workouts. There are not enough positive words in the world to express how wonderful the trainers are. Chasen, IkaIka and Nita not only pushed me hard (sprints in the sand, squats and pushups) but they genuinely care about the people they are training and helping them achieve their goals. Even if it's only to work out during vacation. They were all encouraging and very sharp to recognize everyone's potential and made modifications where they were needed. I'm going to miss them. Keep in mind even if you workout every day like I do, working out in the sand is a whole different animal and it will kick your butt. We did two excursions with Adventures by Disney. The first was Kualoa Ranch Experience: Private Beach & Horseback Riding. This was a great tour. We first went to Secret Island where we had lunch and had time to try out paddleboarding or kayaking. Then we went on a Catamaran followed by a quick bus trip to Kualoa Ranch for some horseback riding. This tour was absolutely worth it. The second tour was Pearl Harbor. I would say this, don't do this tour. Go on your own. It was really really rushed. We had almost no time to spend at each attraction, and we had no time to go to gift shops or to even see the rest of the museum or submarine. If you have a rental car, go on your own. The only advantage this tour gives is it gets you the tickets ahead of time so you don't have to wait in line. If you are there during the high season then it may be worth it. When we were there there were no lines whatsoever. My last criticism would be the beach. It is beautiful but don't expect to see much in the way of fish or turtles. To me this wasn't a huge negative at all because there are plenty of fantastic places on Oahu to snorkel and see turtles. (sharkes cove (don't let the name scare you) and turtle beach) I really don't have the need to have everything at my resort being that I am there to see a new state and culture. I never planned on spending every waking moment at the resort. My advice is this, if you want a resort away from the craziness of Honolulu and Waikiki then this is a gem. Do you want to be pampered? This is your place. Do you want to go where everyone is helpful, and wants to share their experiences and expertise of the island.

The pools were incredible and so much fun - even for adults. Everyone we ran into at the resort was super friendly. Staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful. Made you feel very welcome. Restaurants were way overpriced, but that was to be expected in a resort like this. We rented a car as we had other stuff to do and went into Kapolei for a lot of our meals (enjoyed Thai Lao, Assiaggo's, and Koa Pancake House a lot), and across the street to Just Tacos and Roy's as well. The resort is right in Ko Olina which has 4 beautiful lagoons. Aulani and the JW Marriott (right next door) share this lagoon. It was never crowded during our visit, although we visited the week before Japan's Golden Week which I would imagine being incredibly crowded then. The Marriott Beach Club is a couple of lagoons down. Enjoyed walking/running along the lagoons in the a.m. and evening. Thought about trying the Spa, but opted not too - not enough time during our visit and it was outrageously priced. All in all a wonderful visit and can't wait to go back. A car is a must and use it to eat off property in Kapolei which has a lot of restaurants to choose from, a Target, and other discount stores.

Traffic can be quite heavy on any and all of the three main highways during the hours surrounding typical rush hours. Planning ahead, checking traffic reports and use of your GPS will reduce stress! That being said, Aulani is on a quieter side of the island-- one that is currently being developed and might become busier in the coming years. The resort shares a man-made lagoon with J Marriott and is surrounded by planned community style housing. There are a couple of restaurants and shops, a nice golf course, and several quiet lagoons nearby. The ocean is much calmer and easier to swim in these lagoons, than at other beaches on this island. I was a guest of family, who are DVC members and frequent Disney flyers. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa facing the pool and ocean. The resort officially opened last August, and they are still working towards a fully functional resort when we stayed in April...not to the point of disruption, but occasional distraction. If we had spent more time at the resort, it could have been annoying (jack hammers running for hours at a time, reconstruction of some features creating noise and inability to use certain spaces for part of our visit, etc.) but certainly not a deal breaker for us. The villa was large, comfortable, and well equipped to support our adventures. A few tips: unless you plan to spend the entire week at the resort, rent a car at the airport. If you are not a DVC member, you should budget $30/day to park each car. Stop along the way to the resort for essentials in the kitchen. You will find Safeway, Foodland, Walmart, Costco, Target, etc. at exits along the highway. The food at the resort is not very good, expensive, and service is a challenge-- it was often unclear which venues were open, what was available to order, and the staff was often overwhelmed. If you ask, they will substitute salad for the fries in any of the poolside or to-go meals. Until management can sort through the dining options, I would recommend planning to use your own kitchen or dining off-site. There is a small convenience store in the resort, and one nearby, but both options are limited and expensive. The main feature is the aquatic center of the resort, with: a beach, several pools, hot tub/spas, lazy river, water slide, snorkeling pool, and even a sanctuary for Stingrays. The beach is supported by a rental company for everything from umbrellas to kayaks and paddle boards, but you will not be able to order food or drinks from the resort here...not a big deal, it is close enough. There are also several activity centers: small children, teen/tween, full families, spas, and gym to support all sorts of family vacation goals. I enjoyed spa treatments and used the gym every day. The pool beside the gym tends to be less populated and could become a respite when the construction is finished. We also used the lounge as home base (locker room/showers with bathing suit spinners, TV and computer access, games and comfy sofas and chairs, etc.) for the last day, while waiting for our red-eye flights, but there are all sorts of activities hosted in this space throughout the week. We chose to create our own adventures, so never booked a tour, but the folks in the tour service area were most helpful while planning our adventures. We spent a day and a half exploring the North Shore, visited the USS Arizona/Pearl Harbor site, hiked Diamond Head, and hung out at Waikiki beach for a day. We also hopped a flight to the Big Island and rented a car from Hilo to Volcanos National Park for a spectacular day. We booked the flight and rental car the night before and found plenty of affordable options. I would even recommend perhaps staying overnight in the Volcano area and catching a flight back the next day, if the lava is flowing.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ponte vedra beach, fl", "Title": "\u201cgreat resort for family of tweeners, a few tweaks would make even better\u201d", "Author": "tednugent_10", "ReviewID": "UR129138466", "Content": "We spent 8 nights at the Aulani and marveled at the diversity of activities, especially for kids.

We had a car for the week to explore other beaches and grab an occasional dinner in Waikiki. This is a must if you get cabin fever.

This says a lot considering we live close to Orlando, frequently visit the parks, and have stayed at many of the Disney hotels. It's been 3 weeks since our stay, and we are still talking about how much fun we had. We would suggest trying some of the restaurants off the resort for a change of pace. The Thai Village III is recently opened in Pearl City. It has wonderful, authentic thai food and a very friendly owner. Check out the macadamia nut chocolate chip pancakes at the Koa Pancake House. Stop at Costco to stock up on Hawaiian treats to take home.

We (myself, husband, 3 1/2 yo son) have had an amazing time and can't wait to come back. I am not one to write reviews normally but I think this resort deserves an excellent one. From the moment we arrived and were greeted with yummy water, leis/necklaces, and smiling faces, this has been a wonderful vacation. We checked in online prior to arriving and were immediately greeted and given our goodies then shown around the lobby and taken to our room. We arrived a bit before check-in time and were still given our room right away. We stayed in a studio with DVC points and it was great for the 3 of us. Our son slept on the pull-out couch with no problem although they do have a pack n play in the closet. We had an \"island\" view and while it does overlook a parking garage, from the 14th floor where we were the view of the island is quite lovely. We didn't spend much time in our room so for us an upgrade would not have been worth it for us. The room itself was great. As other reviewers said, the bed is high but it makes for a great place to store luggage so it isn't taking up floor space. The bed was comfy (even the pull-out was pretty good) and I am very picky when it comes to beds. The bathroom is great, nice to have the toilet closed off from the shower and sink. The bath products smelled awesome. Our unit came with a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster and a few kitchen items which we made good use of for making light breakfasts as well as snacks and sandwiches. We rented a car and though we only left the resort a few times it was well worth it. For $160 for the week we were able to leave the property when we wanted to and do a little sightseeing as well as stock up on some food from Safeway. There is an ABC store across the street from the resort as well as a couple of causal places to eat (we didn't try them). Since we were staying with DVC points we didn't have to pay for parking and at $35/night it was a huge savings. The resort itself is amazing. The grounds are beautiful and the water areas were such a hit with my son we almost never left. Auntie's is so well thought out and fun for the kids, my son had a good time there the couple of times we left him. The fact that it is included in the price is a tremendous value. There is so much attention to detail everywhere you turn, it is really evident Disney put a lot of thought into making this a wonderful resort. As others have said, it is not overtly \"Disney\" but focuses much more on the Hawaiian culture. Sure, you see Disney characters from time to time but it is just the perfect amount. I would have enjoyed it even if we weren't here with our son. The week we stayed was definitely not busy and I can understand the concern of some who are worried what it will be like when it is at full capacity. I overheard a cast member telling another guest that it is about 2/3rds open but that they are in the process of building another pool and restaurant. Not sure if this is true but hopefully so. We never had a problem finding a front row lounge chair in the section we wanted and there were plenty of chairs available throughout the day. We also didn't have trouble getting into restaurants even at dinner time. I have to assume it was not near capacity while we were here based on the other reviews. The food is somewhat lacking. We expected that coming in and were actually somewhat pleasantly surprised. The food we had was pretty decent but the selection is limited, especially with the quick serve items. We also found that there wasn't much of a difference in portion size between the keiki menu and the adults - one extra chicken strip for the adults. They don't seem to care if you have kids or not so I would try ordering off the kids menu while around the pool or from the walk-up places to save a little money. They are in the process of building another quick serve place near the pool and that will be helpful - hopefully it has a different menu. We purchased the refillable drink cups right away and they were well worth the price. I visited the spa twice and all I can say is \"WOW\". The price of the treatments are outrageous but if you plan accordingly and spend time before and after taking advantage of the outdoor water areas then it makes it worthwhile. I would definitely recommend this. Yes, this resort is very pricey but I think all of the things it has to offer provide a lot of value and make it worth the price. If you are not planning on spending a lot of time at the resort then it probably isn't worth it but if you take advantage of all the included things it is well worth the high price.

Overall, the trip was very nice and met our (somewhat) low expectations. We weren't expecting 5-star opulence or service. The resort has wonderful facilities for children, from the pool area to the lovely man-made beach lagoon. Here's a comprehensive list of our stay's highs and lows. The bad first. When I initially called to make the reservation, I was told that there was a non-refundable one night deposit, so I didn't make the reservation right then. I did, however, make a note of this in my travel notebook. When I called back a few weeks later, I was told that there is no deposit and no way that I could have received that information from one of their staff. Of course, I was looking at the information in my notes at that time. By this time, the ocean-front rooms were taken. The reservation staff assured me that the partial-ocean-view rooms did NOT overlook the parking garage. They only overlook the pool. Upon check-in, however, they wanted to give us a room looking directly at the parking garage. I hadn't flown 14 hours with three small children to Hawaii to look at a parking garage, so of course I protested. Luckily it was early in the day and the manager on duty was able to scramble our rooms to give us rooms overlooking the pool instead. The spa is beautiful, and the massage I had was fabulous. However, it is egregiously expensive, by any standards. Again, I had some issues with the spa that the manager was able to work out. First they lost my initial booking but were able to fit me in the next day. The massage itself was wonderful, but the therapist shorted me 10 minutes of the 80-minute massage. At $220++, you can bet I complained to the staff on my way out. The manager kindly offered to charge me for only a 50-minute treatment instead, and I was certainly fine with that. Perhaps the biggest problem with the hotel is that there aren't enough food choices for such a large hotel. There are really only 2 restaurants. When the hotel is at full capacity, as it was during our stay, you must have reservations for almost any meal, aside from the poolside lunch service. The room service menu is also somewhat limited. For a hotel of its size, I would expect more like 4 restaurants. The food options are more on par with a resort under 100 rooms. Our food was uniformly good, but between the limited choice and the cost of the food, we ended up going off-site on several occasions. Our kids are used to Asia, so they were actually thrilled to go to the Denny's a 10-minute drive away and eat pancakes for dinner, but I can see how many people wouldn't find that very exciting. It also requires a car. There are a lot of good things about the hotel, of course. The facilities are fabulous, very clean and well-maintained. Our kids loved the children's club, which is a great value relative to other hotels that charge upwards of $80/day/child. Between the pool, water slides, kids club, and the beautiful beach, there's more than enough to keep the kids occupied for days without leaving the resort. The nice thing about the pool, as well, is that it is suited to children from infancy to teenagers. We quite liked our actual rooms. They have some nice extra amenities, like ceiling fans and nice balconies with screen doors. Each room also has an empty mini-fridge, which we really appreciated. I hate going into hotels where the minibars are stocked at floor level with tempting but ridiculously priced treats. (You step into the bathroom for 5 minutes and the next thing you know you're toddler has consumed $20 worth of M&Ms.) We made a Target run and filled the fridge with juice, yoghurt, and the like. We also like that the actual toilet has a separate space in the bathroom with its own door. The only downsides of the rooms are that the furniture seems to be a bit oversized for a resort that caters to families. As other reviewers have noted, the beds and the sink are ridiculously high. I brought an inflatable bed rail for my toddler, which was a lifesaver. They should stock the bathrooms with foot stools for little ones. Of course, the elevated beds gives you plenty of space to store your luggage, which is a plus. The service that we received was uniformly nice and accommodating. Everybody on site worked hard to rectify any problems we encountered, so I think they are doing a good job with their onsite service training. We found it very useful to have a car, but the surrounding area and the road between Honolulu and the resort are less than inspiring. In fact, they're rather depressing. Once you're on the Kapolei resort grounds, it feels more like a holiday spot. Overall, I can definitely recommend this resort if you're traveling with young children and want a holiday with minimal work, but the resort is not inspiring enough that we will be returning.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redding, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cWhat a difference a week makes...\u201d", "Author": "LoveBoatDream", "ReviewID": "UR128675783", "Content": "One adult, one child (age 12.5) April 14-22 En route to the hotel, I read a bunch of reviews from people who had just stayed the week before we got there and I was concerned reading about the crowds and long waits to eat. Well, apparently, that was Spring Break for the West Coast and Hawaii is a big destination for folks on that side of the country! I'm from the East Coast and most folks here go to Florida for Spring Break. So, the crowds were gone and we were able to enjoy the beauty and serenity of Aulani and not have to fight over a lounge chair! The Disney touch was apparent the moment we arrived. We have stayed in many Disney hotels from the budget (Pop Century) to the Deluxe (Animal Kingdom Lodge and Wilderness Lodge) As traveled Disneyites know, all Disney employees are called \"Cast Members\" and they are playing roles. They are taught to be extra nice and helpful. Well, the employees at Aulani went above and beyond. The spirit of Aloha enveloped everything and I felt that all of the people we were met were honestly glad we were there and were truly interested in us and wanted to share their stories and culture with us. We were greeted at the entrance by a host who presented me with a tuberose lei (heavenly smell!) and my son with a \"Menehune\" necklace. Menehune are mythical and mischevious creatures who enhabit the resort. Men receive a kukui nut necklace for enlightenment (I think women don't get them because we are already enlightened!) We were given a tour of the lobby and brought out to the balcony to view the grounds and given an overview. Then we were escorted to the reception desk. After we were checked in, I liked that the receptionist stepped from behind the desk to give us our keys and welcome us. We are DVC members. We stayed in a Deluxe Studio with an ocean view. It was a lovely room. Perfect for 2. Although 4 can sleep there, I think it would be a little tight. We had a small fridge, microwave and sink. There was a coffee maker and a toaster.I asked for a sharp knife and a cutting board and they arrived promptly. I highly recommending paying the upcharge for the better view because otherwise you could be looking at the parking lot. The bathrobes in the room were so cozy. We loved the beds! It was almost like a Westin Heavenly Bed. We didn't feel like venturing out too far the first night so we just went to the ABC market across the road for a few supplies. It is an upscale ABC market. There is also an ice cream shop and a couple of small restaurants there. Aulani is in a private enclave along with a Marriott time share and a golf course/ time share. Paradise Cove luau is also walking distance from the hotel. There is a Roy's restaurant at the Golf Club. There is a gatehouse at the entrance and you give your name when you arrive to receive a parking pass. I recommend renting a car at the airport. I paid $141 for the entire time I was there from Alamo. We were chatting with a family who paid that for a car they rented from the Alamo desk at the hotel for just 2 days! Five minutes drive from the hotel is the town of Kapolei. They have Costco, Target, KMart, Walmart, Home Depot, many fast food places, Safeway and Longwood drugs. We ate a few times at the Hapa Grill which is a local restaurant. We also enjoyed the Kapolei Chinese restaurant. It was more of a \"chinatown\" style place rather than a local Chinese restaurant. We bought supplies at Costco and I also found nice Hawaiian shorts, macadamia nut chocolates and other souvenirs there. I also bought Hawaiian pinepapple for $2.99 Parkling at the hotel is $35/ day unless you are DVC. Then it is free. Aulani was just lovely. We didn't want to leave! The lazy river was never crowded and my son enjoyed the slide many times without long lines. The body slide was unfortunately closed. The other pools were never crowded and we could always find a chair in the area of our choosing. The infinity hot tub was just opened on our last day. It was lovely, but I wish they didn't allow kids in there. They were all crowded in and were using it like a swimming pool. I was concerned about the jackhammering I read about but it was mostly over. There was construction but it didn't bother us at all. The beach was a man made lagoon. No waves, but perfect for swimming and paddle boarding. Paddleboards are $30/ hour. There is a charge for umbrellas on the beach, but not for chairs. If you walk past the end of the path past the Marriott, there are interesting tidal pools with fish and turtles and crabs. It is a beautiful spot. My son didn't use Painted Sky, the tween/ teen area that often but he did enjoy all of the ukelele lessons. We ended up buying a ukelele! The Pau Hana Community room was a nice area. Here you can make a video postcard to send to friends. We participated in many of the craft classes, both complementary and paid. They also offered hula lessons. They have a \"Menehune Adventure\" that is similar to the KimPossible activity at Disney World. You can take out an iPad like device and \"Aunty\" sends you on explorations and adventures around the resort. It is fn for all ages! The spa was heavenly! Service and treatments were wonderful. The relaxation area was unique. Several soaking pools and a garden of showers made it so interesting and yes, relaxing! I didn't want to leave! The only sour note was the food! We had heard from past reviews and people we spoke to on our trip that the buffet was horrible. And, for $43/ person it was way overpriced. The pool menu was uninspired and overpriced. Tuna sandwich on taro roll, chicken strips, burger, grilled veggie sandwich. No salads. And, the kids tuna was exactly the same as the adult version for half the price! A middle type restaurant is needed. We did eat at Ama Ama. The view is just lovely. Our dinners were very nice, but overpriced. I had the paella and my son had the Striploin. We had no drinks and shared a dessert (the Hawaiian chocolate cake is delicious!) and it was $120! After that, we had lunch there twice and for 2 entrees (Fish Tacos were very good and my son enjoyed the pork buns) and a shared chocolate cake and the bill was $60! So glad we had a car and could eat out! Hapa Grill was $25 for both of us! Shaved ice was a nice treat but we usually went to Costco for $1.35 frozen yogurt!!! My son took 2 surf lessons with Hawaiian Fire (arranged through hotel) That was a big hit! We drove up to the north shore one day and had shrimp at Giovanni's shrimp truck and dessert at Teds. Parking in Waikiki was very expensive!! It is very built up with all of the \"chic\" stores. We brought home cookies from Honolulu Cookie Company and they were delicious! Don't miss the swap meet at Aloha Stadium for all of your souvenirs. Best prices anywhere! And, you can bargain. Overall, we had a wonderful and relaxing time and look forward to coming back to Aulani again! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was for the food. I'm glad we had a car. I think next time we might go for a bigger room with a full kitchen so we can avoid the hotel restaurants totally.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cFamily Fun\u201d", "Author": "polaris4", "ReviewID": "UR128626072", "Content": "The hotel rooms are big and comfortable.

We \u201crented\u201d DVC points from a DVC member and had a 2 bedroom 2.5 bath \u201cvilla,\u201d which came with a kitchen, plus living area and stackable washer/dryer in the unit, which was great. This also entitled us to free parking and 10% off certain activities. Despite the fact that we paid for an ocean view and requested an even numbered room (i.e., interior), they didn\u2019t have any available and ended up with the dreaded \u201cMarriott view,\u201d which is really ocean view obstructed and not a pure ocean view. But we could still see the ocean and mountains and didn\u2019t worry too much about it. Because of the time change, our kids were up early and it was never a problem getting a couple of chairs in an area we wanted. We did leave personal items (such as a scarf or hat) on the chairs so people didn\u2019t move them and tried to be considerate if we weren\u2019t going to be using the chairs. One day we rented a cabana, which was nice but $$$. They bring you fresh fruit and the service is great, but it was expensive and we didn\u2019t do it again. Plus, the best cabanas were reserved months ago and so we were left with options further away from the main pool. In your list of things to reserve early: character breakfast, cabana, Makai preserve, and Ama Ama (on the weekends). The pools were great. As was the little lagoon, perfect for young kids and adults. The water is cool, but when it\u2019s warm they feel great. There also are three hot tubs if you need to warm up. Aunties Beachouse was great. My daughter did the extra cost \u201cpremium\u201d programs, Surf\u2019s Up with Chip and Dale (she loved), Fish are Friends (she loved) and Making Magic, which sounds like a treasure hunt, but isn\u2019t and she didn\u2019t like. The Makai reserve was very neat for her, but I felt bad for the small ray enclosure (and knowing one ray was wild caught). We did the length of stay pass for Rainbow Reef, which was a good value if you have a young child whole is getting used to snorkeling. If not--its a small area--and the ocean offers much better snorkeling. The food: not great but not horrible (with the exception of the dinner buffet which was horrible and overpriced\u2014avoid it). The character breakfast was typical buffet fare. Ama Ama was good. The poolside food was pretty good in my opinion (for pool food, good turkey wrap) and the room service was pretty good (except the pasta marinara which was tasteless). Because we had a villa with a kitchen we stocked up at the ABC store (which is really a little high end market across the street), Costco and Target\u2014both of which are a 5-minute drive away. Make sure you rent a car or you will be pretty land locked. Across the street, we ate at Just Tacos (pretty good, get a reservation on the weekend), and the Hawaiian BBQ\u2014which was bad. Food is expensive in Hawaii and we knew that going in. The snow cones poolside are great and the little resort market has enough to get you by for a few days. We did surf lessons (with my six year old), through Girls Who Surf, which is just about a 15-minute drive and had a great experience (Susie was awesome!). Drove to the North Shore (good tide pools at Sharks Cove, but generally a better trip for older kids or adults). The beds are very comfortable, but the pillows were really think. We ended up buying a cheap pillow at target for our youngest child who otherwise really couldn't use the hotel pillows. The room was very nice and well appointed. Not a Four Seasons, but one of the nicer \"family\" hotels we have stayed at. One of the other things I found good was the room noise insulation--very quiet. It was magical having Mickey, Minnie and the Disney gang at the hotel and we would go back (we just might need to save a few years to do it). Every single \u201ccast member\u201d was cheery and helpful\u2014consistently, I was very impressed with that.

The staff was very helpful and accomadating. For people with children be prepare for the food Disney Aulani Hotel want's to keep the hawaiin culture alive, so the food is very local and they do not cater to American food. They have 4 restaraunts on site one off them is a buffet they serve hawaiin food and japanese also like sushi, they have some pizza and chicken finger for the kids at night. In the morning for breakfast again hawaiin food like sausages bacon, eggs, rice, also sushi, and for the children mickey pancakes and bacon. The 2 other quick service restaurants called of the hook and 2 paddle one paddle is burger, chicken finger and fries. The last restaurant AMA is only local hawaiin food. The restaurants in the resort are very expensive they cheapest thing starts from 14 up to 56 dollars drinks start about 9 dollars. If u are just staying at the resort highly recomment the meal plan. The resort is located outside Honolulu like 30min its very remote area the resort is in Ko Alina. If you want to go around to see hawaii recommend to rent a car, but parking cost 35 dollars a day. They are some little restaurants located outside the resort but they are not that good one is called taco loco and the other was hawaiin food not that great. they have a little grocery store outside the resort which is super expensive, we rented a car and went to a grocery store called saver and we saved a lot money. If you it at the resorts restaurants make sure u arrive 20 min early because they get packed really fast it doesnt matter if you have a reservation. The staff was very nice and friendly they are a brand new hotel so the staff was a little new they looked like they were adjusting. they didn't know to much information about some of the places, like good restaurants to eat outside the hotel. I highly recommend Roys restaurant located at the golf course near the hotel, is very expensive but the food was amazing the chef is very famous in hawaii and the golf course near the hotel is were they have the famous competitions that tiger woods goes to and michell wii was there when we went to have dinner. If you decide to go there dinner is around 100 bucks per person. also if you want to avoid the parking fee, rent a car for the day and return it each day. we rented the car from monday to friday and it was 300 dollars also if they ask you the option of returning the vehicle empty for 65 dollars more take it, we didnt and the day we reuturn the vehicle we had to go look for a gas station and it was 15 min away and then we got lost, and when we filled it up it was like 75 bucks. We used a whole tank of gas and we got to see the whole island on that so u wont need to fill it up. When you rent a car you must go to the north shore, going into the north shore there is the Dole plantation for pineapple,you must also go to benzai beach and the botanicle gardens. Also go to sharks cove you can snorkle for free. Also go all the way from honolulu to Kailua its very beautiful for seightseing an beautiful beaches.

This hotel was a dream come true. Their service is outstanding. You feel welcome as soon as you arrive, water was offered with lemon, lime and pineapple, it was wonderful. Our previous hotel had been lackluster and we mentioned it to the front desk, they proceeded to upgrade our room to an ocean view. The room was amazing. It had all the small details and comforts I would expect from Disney. The beds were made perfectly, the furniture was in excellents shape, the carpet was textured with leaves. It was just amazing in there. It was the relaxing room you would want in Hawaii and the private balcony was perfect. My husband is visually impaired and they did a great job of accomodating our request to be near an elevator. Concering the crowds others had mentioned, I was there on a day when the entire hotel was booked up. My husband and I went in the pool after we checked out and he couldn't use his cane. He held onto my arm and we had no difficulty navigating the crowds. The lines for the slides aren't bad. The only challenge was near the pools the lounge chairs were full, but a little further back there were plenty and more on the beach. They truly have great service. That is the mark of a great hotel more than anything else. Everyone was polite and courteous. Lisa at Ama Ama for example was wonderful, I've never had a waitress as good. I've stayed at five star hotels before and this hotel has every inch of that service. I really enjoyed watching the night entertainment and the hotel staff entertaining the kids even if they had other jobs. Watching the hotel guys get up front and helping the little kids hula was priceless. A great perk they offer is their lounge area for people without a room either because of early arrival or checking out before a flight. It had showers, tvs, lockers, towels, computers, everything! It made the last few hours much better and is immensely appreciated. Take the chance if you can to take the art tours and the like that they offer. They're free and give you so much insight to Aulani and it's history. So much of the Hawaiian culture was taken into account. I wish I could remember the names of the two women who led the tours because they were wonderful. After a hectic few days at Waikiki this was amazing. I chance to just relax and enjoy the beauty of the resort. I have recommonded this hotel to everyone I know. It is pricey, but I would pay it again.

The hotel was at full occupancy, which we expected so we had booked all our spa and dining reservations many months prior. The hotel was easy to find and a short drive from the airport. Tip: rent a car as there is not enough to do at Aulani to keep you busy for more than a couple days and the car rental (Enterprise) is cheaper than the taxi to and from. However, be aware that there is a $35 overnight parking charge. Feeling adventrous? you can park right between the Marriot and Aulani for free and there didn't seem to be any problem with overnight parking... this is at the lot for public beach access. This is only a few more steps away then the self-service parking deck. Or, for the same price as self-parking you can have valet parking (of course you need to tip). The resort itself was very nice and reminded me a bit of the wilderness lodge at disney world of course with a hawaiin theme instead. I guess we were all expecting more of a \"disney destination\" more so than a hotel. This is a nice family hotel but it isn't another Atlantis (Paradise Island). There are two slides and a slow lazy river. One of the two slides was shut down for maintenance during our week long stay. There are three hot-tubs - one is big and has a beautiful view of the ocean, however that one was also shut down for a week so only the two small hot tubs were available. They put out a program schedule with the day's events, but that we found it was not too reliable. We attended one event that never happened and then we went to another and the same happened so we went to the front desk to ask what was going on. They then called someone and it started about 30 minutes late. The evening show was listed as a two hour event, but the show only turned out to be 30 minutes. The show itself was good; however, we wished we had planned another activity as it did not consume our entire evening. According to teh day's program they had no activities planned for Easter Sunday. We double-checked this at the front desk as they always do something at the Grand Floridian in Florida, so we expected they might have something here too. We were told there was nothing, but then found out after the fact that they had some \"unadvertised\" events and easter egg hunts. This seemed to be the \"theme\" at the resort. No one is quite clear on what is happening or when. We also had the power at the entire resort go out a couple time and then an emergency announcement and alarm seemed to be on the fritz one day. Tip: if renting a paddle board, don't rent for more than the hour minimum, there is not much cover to paddle around and it gets a bit boring after about 30 minutes. Now, onto the food and drinks. We had read so many reviews about the bad drinks at the lounges that we opted to mix our own. We stopped at the local Walmart and picked up everything we needed. We tried all the restaurants on site and would have to say \"it was just okay\" not great. The character breakfast buffet and dinner buffet did not have as many options as we expected when compared to what is at the Disney resorts in Florida. The quick service restaurant was reasonable in price but only had a few items to choose from. All we tried were good, but after a few days we were feeling the lack of variety. Both teenagers voted and said the frozen yogurt bar Rip Curl was a rip off and not at all good. They loved the shaved ice stand though. Other food options: We found a nice breakfast buffet with a great ocean front view about 3 blocks down the boardwalk at one of the Marriot resorts. It was $17 for the hot breakfast and $13 for the cold buffet (fruit, muffins, juices, coffee, etc.). Mainly the view was the best for an early morning breakfast. We also ate at Just Tacos across the street from the hotel several times. The food was good but the service was slower when they were busy. Try going for an early or late dinner and it seemed just fine. And the prices were very reasonable. The little ABC store in the strip mall across from the hotel had the best and most reasonably priced meals and breakfast plates. Just a few little tables outside to eat at, but they package it to go and it is just a few minutes back to the hotel. The food quality seemed to be the best at the market/ABC store. We also checked out Roy's which was a bit more of a walk, but the options seemed good there (it is an Outback restaurant).", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cNicest Hotel I've ever been too\u201d", "Author": "dcpign87", "ReviewID": "UR128440357", "Content": "I just got back from Aulani yesterday.

We we're getting a 2 bedroom pool view which we used more points to secure. We left and went to Safeway (Highly reccomment that you get a grocery card) We saved a ton of money and received a $10.00 gift card for our next visit. Safeway is 2 exits back toward Honolulu. There are many nationally known restaurants in the are of the grocery store. After picking up our groceries, went back to the resort and our room was ready. We walked in and our wonderful view was on the ground floor and we looked into a Bush. That was it. After a nine hour flight I was too tired to fight. The staff said the place was full which I doubt. Some staff told me that if you express your disatisfaction they will move you. The room itself was beautiful, functional and extremely clean. Food at the resort is a mixed bag. The buffet at the character breakfasts was delicious. Very expensive, but delicious. The sandwiches at the pool bar are OK. With your typical Disney Fries. (Blah). The Gift shop offers some cold items but they seemed to be understocked. The whole food situation at this resort needs to be worked on. The pool area is very nice and the slides are wilder than i thought they would be. The lagoon is a fun area and the nearby Marriott Resort and Hotel are nice to grab a bite of food at. There are nice walking paths to get from resort to resort. The activities for the kids were well received by my kids and they took advantage of the programs and met some kids from all over the world. The Hawaiann show that the resort puts on is fairly good albeit cheesy at times. The resort is really geared towards young families with moms and dads and grandparents. We had a nice time, made it into Honolulu for shopping and the Peaqrl Harbor tour. Overall staff are very friendly and mean well but some of them are lacking in resort knowledge. When things don't go the way they planned, they shrink in their duties.

I'm sorry to give a mixed review of the resort, but they have some essential improvements to make before this resort is worth the cost. Positives: Oahu is a beautiful island with a rich culture. Get out and explore the north shore and the valley. Gorgeous. Aunties beach house was a hit for the kids ( We were there with 4 families for a total of 8 kids. All but one kid loved the child care.) The lazy river, water slides, and pool area were non stop fun. The beach is a perfect place for little kids to play safely. Everyone at the resort is amazingly friendly. They tried their best to be helpful. The lifeguards were everywhere and vigilant. Anytime one of my kids fell or was crying, they asked if we needed help! I got great recommendations from the concierge. The entertainment was fantastic. Starlit hui was very well done! Lots of fun features on property: scavenger hunt, sting rays, rainbow reef, outdoor movies. They keep,the kids moving and entertained. Well done! Areas of improvement: Somehow, this resort misses the mark. We jokingly called it the \"compound\". It felt incredibly caged in and busy. The elevators were full, pool areas full, restaurants booked, beach overrun, etc. I couldn't walk a straight line without feeling like I was in someone's way. It will be a nightmare when the second tower opens. It was not relaxing. I was exhausted from watching my kids run from water feature to water feature, apologizing for being in the way, and looking for a place to eat, The food here is amusement park food. It. Was. Awful. This is not an understatement. Everything is served in to go containers with plastic silverware. There is no place you can have a nice meal with your family and look out at the ocean. The exception is Ama Ama. It looks gorgeous, but our friends ate there and refused to return. It cost them over $200 to eat amusement park food (albeit on regular plates) on a sticky table. The buffet was disgusting. Similar to old country buffet restaurant. We wanted drinks and appetizers on our last night and ended up with plastic dishes and cups again with no view of the ocean. Sad. We left the property for dinner and lunch on every opportunity we could get. The rooms are nothing special. Single sink. Regular tub. 14th floor partial ocean view overlooked the lit parking lot. While sitting on the lanai, I had a view of the ocean and mountains that was overshadowed by a huge, brightly lit, white parking lot. Cover it up and add a rooftop garden, Disney! There were no special amenities in the room. Cleaning was average. Turndown was timely with a little flower or chocolate treat that the kids loved. They had a hot tub closed, a waterside closed, a new food area being built, and construction to the main dining area happening while we were there. Really? On spring break? These are much needed improvements, but no one wants to see and hear construction on their $500 a night vacation. Three of these construction areas were at the main pool. Overall, this is a fantastic resort for kids. Mine complained the entire day we were off property. But it misses the mark for adults. I'm fine with Disneyland in Disneyland, but when I go to Hawaii, I want to be pampered too. They need to cater to the grown ups more if this resort is going to fly. Huge kudos to the staff for maintaining the aloha spirit despite all that they are working against. Mahalo for a fun trip, Disney.

Staying on the westside of Oahu is a totally different experience than Waikiki/southside. First off, it's not as built up out west so for the most part you'll be eating at the resort or the Ko Olina Marriott resort next door unless you want to rent a car. 1.) Let's seque into parking---it costs $35/day regardless of whether you valet or self-park. 2.) Food is expensive here but if you stick to eating poolside at the One Paddle Two Paddle or Off the Hook you can save a bunch. The food at both is the typical poolside fare--burgers, chicken strips, wraps--and the food is surprisingly good, portion sizes are just about right as well. 3.) The pools and slides are great for everyone-kids of all ages will be happy. Be forewarned---if you try to sneak a pal into the pools you WILL get caught. They've got a million lifeguards and one of their jobs is to scope out people who don't have bracelets. 4.) The gift shop-aside from being overpriced ($75 for a polo shirt-really?) they don't offer much either. Order from the Disney Store online, this place is a joke. 5.) Character breakfast-you can make a reservation like we did but you still need to be prepared to wait. We were reserved for 9:30 and had to wait in line to check in, they handed us a buzzer saying it would be 15-20 minutes and then an hour later they paged us. At that point they took us over to have our picture taken with Mickey. We were next in line, of course at that time Mickey went on break. We had to wait--couldn't go to our table, no one knew how long Mickey would take so we left. We complained first--nicely--but the hostess and her Manager both said \"A reservation only guarantees your seat for this day, there's no time reservation\" which makes no sense because they issue certain times for their reservations. Nice to know they aren't willing to make things right nor are they willing to apologize for their obvious disorganization. 6.) Child care-if you have a child under the age of 3 don't come here. They provide child care for free for children 3 and up. We live here and have a regular sitter, but we weren't allowed to bring her on the property to use the pools with him and then we'd also have to pay for her parking too. The hotel refused to work with us despite our dinner reservations at their fancy restaurant. 7.) Teens-if you have a tween or teen, they will really enjoy the teen group at Painted Sky. We sent our 13 y/o and he had a blast. 8.) Overall Ambience-eh. It's Hawaii, it's gorgeous here. But the hotel itself, I've seen better. IMO nothing beats the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Aulani is very pretty but I had to giggle when we went in the lobby. Some of the Hawaiian stuff is ridiculously overdone to the point that it's funny. But they take all the cultural stuff very seriously. Bottom line is... You can get a better deal in Waikiki on a hotel. Do it, and get a rental car so you can drive your kids out to meet the Disney characters. It's free to go to their meet and greets.

Typical Disney. Meticulous attention to every detail in the resort from the design and architecture of the buildings to the smallest details of the landscaping and art work. The two bedroom two and a half bath \"vacation home\" was more than adequate with a full kitchen, large LR, washer/dryer, two balconies. In order to have a view over the pool area which has a \"volcano water slide\" in the middle, you need to be on the 6th floor or above. Rooms offering a \"mountain view\" actually look out to a parking garage and the back of the JW Marriott next door. All of the pools and water activities will keep any age kid happy and busy all day(including 60 something's). Our kids loved the lazy river and tube slide. The water slide is steep, fast and in the dark. After one slide, only our son in law went back. Lifeguards were EVERYWHERE and standing, patrolling all water features around the pools. The ocean lagoon and beach are beautiful and allowed the kids to snorkel and swim safely. Lots of rental equipment. Expensive. We brought our own snorkel equipment. All beaches in Hawaii are public and there were no lifeguards but the cabana staff was there if there had been a problem. My husband and I rented two person cabanas facing the beach($35 1/2 day and $45 full day). Our grandchildren are great swimmers and enjoyed the lagoon for swimming and the pool areas for water activities. We tried \"Aunty's Beach House\" one day. They did not stay and we felt it was for very small children and parents needing babysitting services. The kids did take the interactive hand held computers ( like an iPad) on a tour of the pool area called The Waikolohe Valley hunting for hidden Hawaiian Menehunes. They loved this and it was a good break from the water. Interacting with the sting rays and going into the fish tank was expensive and not a great experience. The ladies learned how to make fresh flower leis at the Hawaiian Crafts Class. Movie night under the stars and evening fire pit story telling were great endings to busy days in the sun. Now for the NEGATIVES: when all the rooms are completed there will be over 3000 guests and they have 800 lounge chairs by the pools. They have staff patrolling the chairs and if you are away from your chair for more than an hour, they remove ALL of your belongings. When you have kids off in the pool areas, beach etc , it is difficult to time your absence from your chair! Very poor planning by \"the Mouse\" and stressful for hotel guests. ...DINING: Very Expensive for mediocre quality. The Makahiki Buffet Restaurant was the worst. There were flies and swarms of small bugs all over the food stations. I complained about this and they admitted they were having a problem and had not been able to find a solution. They also said they had spoken to the JW Marriott next door which did not have this issue. The food selection was poor. At $43.00 per person, not worth it. The AMA AMA Restaurant overlooking the Ocean had a good menu and no bugs. Better for adults and older kids. There is a pool side casual cafe and another \"Shrimp Shack\" under construction. Be prepared for pricey meals. We enjoyed Roy's and the Marriott restaurants more than the Disney property restaurants. Walk down the beach pathway to the Marriott Time Share Resort for a great restaurant on the water with a terrific kid's menu, decent prices, no reservations. If you have a car, there is a Costco on your way to the resort from the airport. Better than shopping for breakfast/lunch items in the resort area. If you are interested in attending a Luau, there is a very good one within walking distance called Paradise Cove. Go early to get a good table seating. There is an intra resort shuttle connecting all the properties and golf communities along KoOlina. Unless you want to visit other Oahu attractions, you do not need a car. There is a car rental agency on the Disney property. Our kids spent one day climbing Diamond Head and snorkeling on the North Shore. It was an $80.00 cab ride from the airport to the resort. We did not use any of the Spa facilities. Walking the 2 1/2 mile paved walkway connecting all of the resort lagoons was a great morning walk. We had a wonderful vacation with our children and grand kids. My husband has one opinion when it comes to any Disney Resort Experience. You can always expect three things from \"The Mouse\": spectacular attention to everything about the resort; masterful entertainment for kids of all ages ; superior ability to separate parents and grandparents from their money. It is a long way to travel from the East Coast of the USA but we like taking Hawaiian vacations, and it was worth the travel to have our family together in such a beautiful spot.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cA good place to take a break\u201d", "Author": "gut73raf", "ReviewID": "UR128005226", "Content": "Well, I finally got there. After several months of reading reviews (Good and Bad), I finally got to see it for myself. This is the first hotel I stayed at where the option of visitors can reach both side of extreme. From very good to very bad. So I was very intrigue to experience it for myself. All in all, I LIKE IT and I would go back again if given the chance. My kids (two girls) loved the place and at the end that is what I wanted, and what I got. It is not perfect but it was close to it. This is my personal experience and yes, it is different from other visitors. Parking: $35.00 a day, cost more to park the car then the rental of the car :) I think all hotels in HI charge a parking fee of about $10.00 a day so I am not sure why Aulani needed to charge more. (about the only negative point) The room I had a room in the 9th floor with two queen size bed, it was a standard room with an ocean view. We only use the room to take showers and sleep. We would leave around 8:00 am and not get back until 6 or 7 PM so for a place to crash at night, it was not bad at all. There was a cafe maker in the room and the cafe was not bad at all. There is a small refrigerator that we used to store food we bought across the street. Internet access was free :) about the only thing that was free. The pool area (The towels & chair wars) Every hotel now suffers from the same symptom, no chair available to sit if you show up around 12:00 PM, so most people will get up early to reserve all the chair they need and then some. Aulani had the same problem, however, each section is patrol by a towel person checking to see if anyone had reserve chairs and did not used them. If after 1 hour you were not back at your chair, they would remove the towels, store your personal belonging and give the chair to some else. Not sure how I feel about this policy. I think is good and bad, if you get up early to get a good spot while others sleep in and then get your stuff remove because you were too busy enjoying yourself, I am sure you will not be a happy camper. At the same time, if you are going on a tour and will not be there for several hours, it is not fair to others. I did not have a problem as I got to know the towel person and let them know I was there. Most people did the same thing however I did see her remove towels from chairs and people showing up wondering where their stuff was, they were not too happy about it. There were a lot of people on Sunday, yet, I never felt crowed as there are lot of pools and of course the wonderful beach area. As many have mention, 1/3 of the hotel area still not open so I wonder how crowed is going to get once it is open. Can't wait to get a report, once they open. We did get the letter about the closing of a pool and water slide yet, they were open while we were still there. I am sure eventually they closed them and I agree they should have waited until spring break was over to do any work. The Food & Restaurant. I still wonder, if you are a member of this site and read all the reviews and know that if you want to dine or have breakfast at any of their restaurants, you need to make reservation before you leave for your trip, why there still people who complain when they can't get a table when they try to make a last minute reservation? Tip: Go to their website and make reservations if you want to eat there before you leave. You can make as many reservations as you like. Yet, as others have stated, it is extremely expensive to eat there. A party of 4, two adult, two children for dinner at any of their restaurant is more than $120.00 easily. I had dinner at both restaurant and the food was okay for me but at that price, I would expect more. There are other choice near by and if you have a car, which you need just to get to the hotel, you can drive a few miles (about 3) to the near town. You will have many choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner as well at much lower prices. We ate at an the Italian restaurant, good food, cost $70.00, not bad. Costco runs, you will probably hear this term a lot. It is a common thing for people to go to Costco to load up on anything they may need, including alcoholic drink, The hotel has no problems or restriction on bringing food into their property, so take the time to make a \"Costco run\". If you don't want to drive, there a grocery store called \"ABC\" across the street. It has everything you may need, from personal stuff, food and gifts to bring home :) The place is expensive, even for HI prices, but it is Disney resort after all. Once they attached the name to the place, you can expect to pay more but is it worth it.... Many people, including me, think so. All in all, I am just glad I had a great time, my kids had a super great time and at the end that is all the matter :) tour tip: If you plan a trip to Pearl Harbor, you can drive yourself there. There is plenty of parking space and you can spend as much time as you need. If you want to see all, you will probably need about 8 hours. Also reserve your tickets in advance by going to their website. http://www.recreation.gov You need to create an account but I think it will save you a lot of time.

Misses: Restaurant Service, Food and Options. Disney does a great job entertaining all guests. There's a little something for everyone. This is certainly a great place for families (as it is geared toward such) since parents can check in young ones into Auntie's Beach House for as much as is wanted (included in resort price) where children may be fed lunch and/or dinner for an additional fee. My son loved the place and if you spend a few minutes witnessing the staff interacting with the children as well as all of the options available to them you would understand why. The Pool area is like a mini waterpark. Now the bad news: we had very poor experiences with the waitstaff at the restaurants, which as a Disney Vacation Member I found shocking. Disney is known for their excellent service. Also, the restaurant options are slim: Buffet or Fancy sit down. Recently, Disney announced they will open another restaurant serving quick food near the pool. Perhaps this will help. Also, I'm sure that as I type this, they are trying to improve the customer service of the waitstaff. Essentially, you pay very expensive food prices to be somewhat ignored. In each of the three meals we had at the resort, we had a hard time finding our server. We aren't picky people...but at least two times it felt like our server left for the day or went on break.

Let me qualify this review by saying that each family surely has its own opinion based on their travel preferences, taste in food, etc. The good: the greeting at the door upon arrival...top notch, getting a text when room was ready...great, having a place to shower and change before leaving for the airport...also wonderful. Some concerns: the Aunty's Beach House activities are overly FULL (and the hotel is not at complete occupancy yet). My kids were told about a volcano experiment happening one evening. The gal told us to be there a little early to get seated- didn't mention to come an hour early or not get a seat. So, off we went to the experiment only to be told that there were no more seats. Another morning, we ate in the continental breakfast area (adjacent and connected to the buffet). We saw Mickey outside so we walked up to him to say \"Hello\" and get a picture. Mickey was rushed off away from us as if we had the plague. When asked if we had eaten in the buffet and we said no, we were quickly told that visiting Mickey at this time was for that crowd only. I guess it takes a $40+ breakfast per person premium to see Mickey! Wow- I would have been REALLY mad if my kids were a tad younger and if I didn't live a stone's throw from D-land. My kids went to a \"Surfs Up\" with Chip and Dale beach party at price of $69 per child. My youngest told me that Chip and Dale only came at the very end to dance because \"they had been on the North Shore surfing all day\"...what??? I paid so that they could actually hang out with the characters!!! Anyway... Now onto the food...no choices really except $$$ entrees and $$$$ buffet or fast food. And, okay, serve me a burger, but make it a good one at least!! Food was unacceptable in terms of options, quality, and price. I don't mind paying a lot of money, but I need to be able to consider the food amazing if I am. Reservations at Ama Ama were impossible. They have an entire patio not in use, but turned us away twice. My husband got us in by going to the front desk and pointing out that our kids were at Surf's up for $140 and we had no where to eat because we couldn't get a reservation in advance at Ama Ama. That got us in...they must save tables for the really upset folks. Our studio \"villa\" consisted of one queen sized bed and a pull out sofa. No extra pillows in the closet nor extra blanket. Very small room for $524+ tax a night. Anyway, the kids enjoyed the aspects of the resort you would assume they would: the slides, the lazy river, the Beach House...but it is an overly crowded \"high end\" resort that doesn't feel very high end... And, yes, I am happy a lot of places I go. It actually doesn't take much to make me feel I am in paradise. The Aulani just didn't do it for me, and yes, my expectations were high. Total cost of 2 nights there (hotel, tax, fee, valet, activity, dinner, continental breakfast, 2 lunches...) @$2000, so I feel I can expect a lot!

We were there for spring break March 24-31. The hotel is so beautiful. Whom ever designed it did a fabulous job. NO arguments there! Absolutely stunning. The waterpark area was just as nice. I have three kids 13, 9 and 6 and everyone was entertained and never bored. Here were some of the complaints from our family...my 13 yr.old didn't really like the beach area as it's in a cove which is nice for little kids but there are no waves at all. As a matter a fact my 6 yr. old kept referring to it as the \"lake\". It did have that feel but that's not Disney's fault just something to be aware of and also a personal preference. One trip to North Shore took care of that. My husband thought the food was terrible and the choices were limited. We would talk to other guests and they agreed. I felt bad that here we were in paradise and everyone was walking around complaining of the food. It was very expensive. I wish they had a quick service restaurant like they do in many of the WDW hotels. They had a little place in the morning with coffee, juice, $6 pastries, etc. but it would have been nice to see a \"quick service\" type restaurant. Disney definately needs to fix this. The reviews about that topic are TRUE!!!! My kids also felt like it wasn't too Disneyish. That can be a good thing or bad thing depending on your family. We didn't care but then agreed there is no reason for a return visit to that hotel since we weren't getting the \"Disney\" treatment. Why pay that type of money? Auntie's Beach house was amazing and the scavenger hunt was great. The welcome lei's and necklace for the children was such a classy touch. Overall we had such a nice time. But I have to agree that at times I felt like things still needed to be \"ironed out\" and I was a $10,000 guinie pig (that was my bill for a family of five) My hard earned money was spent on a vacation with quite alot of kinks to be still worked out. If Disney asked what the problem was I would say.......\"Ya know that magic you created with Castaway Cay?? Can you make it work here? That's what I was looking for in this hotel and didn't get it.

The show was great but realize you will only get enough time for pictures with 2 characters so hustle. I wish the characters stayed on site a few minutes longer.

Although, they are building a new restaurant in the pool area, it really doesn't impact most of the resort, in fact we were sent a letter prior to our arrival of the construction that would be taking place. Our daughter's favorite activity is the Aunties Beach House. Both kids enjoyed doing the Menehune Adventure Trail and the slides at the lazy river. We have stayed at other resorts in Hawaii and I have would say the kids enjoyed this resort the most. The rooms are spacious and we had a great view of the ocean and the lazy river, we were on the tenth floor. Although we paid for partial ocean view, we had a full view of the ocean. We were familiar with the area, because we use to stay at the JW Marriott next door. Food prices are comparable to other resorts, as is the quality. You can walk across the street to the ABC store and pick up snacks or sandwiches or even reasonably priced adult beverages. Instead of paying $35 a day for parking we rented an Alamo Rental car at the airport and turned it in at the hotel, since they have a Alamo counter. On the way we picked up snacks and water to save on buying them through the resort. There is a Costco, Target, Safeway and Walmart not too far from the resort. If you decide to eat outside the resort, there is a Roy's within walking distance, and there will be a new sushi restaurant going in sometime this summer, across the street.

Disney's attention to detail blew me away. It was not kiddie-like, it was sophisticated. The grounds, lobby, kids lobby, common rooms, lazy river, slides, hot tubs, and pool were wonderful. The interactive game the kids play was totally cool. The staff was always friendly, from the valet, to housekeeping, to the front desk. There was so much to do and see on the property and the beach, we found ourselves hurrying around Oahu to get back to Aulani. We were in room 1528, 15th floor, corner view. I was worried because I wanted a view of the pool and ocean (booked partial ocean view). I am also notorious for changing rooms (I go see the room and typically demand another one to choose from \u2013 traveling with me is pretty rough). Nonetheless, the room was wonderfully clean (helps that it\u2019s new) and the view of the lagoon, quiet pool, and spa was fantastic\u2026then because they gave us a corner room, we looked towards the west and the entire ocean opened up before us, with the beautiful Oahu landscape to the side. We were awestruck! See our sunset picture below, it\u2019s from our room! The spa was spectacular. I suggest you go 2-3 hours ahead of your appointment. I only went 50 minutes ahead and after the tour and changing, I only had about 20 minutes to use everything. So I returned another day (an extra $45) to use the spa at night. I was the only one there and it was AMAZING to be in the outside area with the evening lights. We never had trouble finding some quiet pool chairs to call our own, and we liked that they clean up chairs if people leave their towels/things for too long. It keeps the area nice and clean. All the other guests were friendly and non-invasive to our space. It was not crowded in the least and we went on my children\u2019s spring break. The little construction that was going on was not an issue, the contractor makes every effort to be quiet (lining wheel-barrows to prevent noise, and putting up green boards so it doesn\u2019t look unsightly). The food, while delicious, was costly. And most days we had to ask staff to have waiters sent to our pool chairs. Whenever we asked for that help though, everyone was very responsive. I think some people like to complain \u201cafter the fact\" but if you just ask for a little attention, they are happy to assist you. We also opted for the refill mugs, which I didn\u2019t want to splurge on, but it was well worth it. We\u2019d fill our cups up before our off-property outings, which helped keep less trash in the car too! For what it\u2019s worth to you, we LOVED Aulani. I would go back in a heartbeat. I pity the next place I stay to have to live up to my new standards. It was the trip of a lifetime. If you want our itinerary of what we did on the Island and where we ate, e-mail me. We hit a lot of local spots that we asked staff for (we always ask where they eat, not where we should go!), some Man vs. Food restaurants, and great Oahu sites to see.

Our stay was 5 days and the magic began from the moment we arrived. And since its Spring Break, i dont see the resort as overly crowded. As we pulled up we were greeted with Hawaiian hospitality like no other disney property i have visted in the states. The bell staff and front desk met us, we didnt have to go to them. We checked in online and said our arrival would be at 10am. We figured we would have our bags stored until our room was ready at the traditional 3pm, much to our surprise our room was ready. They welcomed us with a leis, water flavored with sliced fruit with a familiar hidden mouse shape, and a \"E Komo Mai\" (Welcome Home). Our bell staff gave us a tour as we walked to our room and pointed out many of the features to the resort. As a Disney Vacation Club (DVC) member we booked the studio room wtih pool view. We were put into a ground floor room, which i thought was going to be horrible. I thought to myself, what kind of view am i going to get, set back from the walk way AND being on the ground level we will never sleep, it will be so loud. But, i was quickly set corrected when i saw how close we were to the pool. How nice it was to walk out the slider and walk to the pool without the hassle of going thru the hotel and elevator in our swimwear and wet towels. The noise level was zero!!! Not sure what kind of doors they have but once they are shut, its soooo quiet. Im hooked on these rooms when i book in the future. Many interactive activites for everyone. Similar to the Disney Cruise Navigator, the Aulani features The Daily 'IWA. The 'IWA outlines activities daily for Family, Children, Youth. More then enough activities to keep you going all day, if the beach, pools, lazy river, and 2 water slides arent enough. There are a few drawbacks thar our family found. The \"counter\" style food, for a simple burger and frys, hot dogs and frys or similar for a snack are lacking. They do have food services similar to that, but we found it needed to be brought by the Poolside Serivce, but of course at a Resort Price - lol. There is however, across from Aulani, a small area with the ABC store and some eating places, that are not as high as Aulani but probably higher then it would be in town due to location. If you do happen to have a rental car you are using, you can get back onto the freeway heading back to Honolulu and about 10 min or so from the resort is Kapolei Commons. There you will find Target, Subway, Ross, Sports Authrotiry and other stores. Just a stones throw from that is Costco, and a variety of other restaurants such as McDonalds, Zippys (the Custard Long Johns are a must !!!!), Burger King, Safeway, Longs Drugs, and WalMart. (The Target had a much needed Starbucks for me) So there are many options other then the resort restaurants. If you are looking for the Aulani SWAG, there is plenty, however, unlike the Theme Parks, i found the items to be very pricey. The cheapest shirt for kids and adults range from $25-$30. I dont remember the Parks shirts being that high. As one review i saw, unless you are DVC member, you will have to pay for parking which is im told $35 a day by hotel staff. Aulani is currently going through some construction near the pool area, which im told is to have more of a counter style snack option. I didnt grade this as Excellent, because i think the property still has some room for improvement, but dont get me wrong, we are having a fantastic time and the resort is amazing.

I cannot believe people are giving poor reviews to this place. We stayed in a Grand Villa with 11 family members including a baby to teens to adults. I think the funniest reviews are from people who didn't stay there, but stayed at the Marriot and think Aulani is a bad place to stay. I wonder if these are the same people that watching the shows from their balcony or trying to sneak into Aulani because their children wanted to be there.

As the week progressed, they remembered our names and talked to us every time we went in and out of the resort. Bell staff = EXCELLENT We went to Ama Ama for dinner and again our service was amazing and the food and drink was also amazing. Ama Ama = EXCELLENT There were small lines for the water slide, but we never waited for a tube for the lazy river nor was it ever overcrowded and we went EVERY day we were there. The life guards were more than friendly and interacted with us every time around the lazy river. The muliple hot tubs were more than sufficient and were always enjoyable. We had a cabana and the service was great. The food we ordered were brought promptly by Travis and was hot and good. The bamboo containers (which someone complained about) are genius and keep the food fresh and hot.The beach was amazing and had a lot of fun activities. Chad at the outside bar made the best coconut smoothie my daughter had ever had. She returned every day! Pool, Beach and Grounds = EXCELLENT The activities staff helped me get a surfing lesson for the three teens in our group. Fire school was full, so they helped me get a reservation with Girls Who Surf. Each of my teens must have rode 25 waves They had the time of their lives.

We were pretty excited and looked forward to a nice weekend. Check in on Friday was great, awesome valet, bell hop and front desk staff. The building and grounds are very nice as well. I thought I was upgrading when I reserved an ocean view studio villa vice a standard room with 2 queens. Our room was pretty small and that's tough on 'family' vacations as you're bringing the whole gang vice a solo business trip. We had a local discount of like 20% but for 500/night I expect a little luxury. Plus 65/night in taxes and 35/day for parking. Disney messed up on a few major details. 1) too many rooms; the place has way too much volume for the amount of space and ammenities. When you look out your balcony you literally see another 300 balconies. There are lines and waits everywhere; even with reservations. What is going to happen when they open the Ewa Wing? The pool deck is completely crowded with rows of lounge chairs packed 3+ deep without enough space inbetween the rows. You feel like you are on a cruise ship and not a beachfront resort. Oh, and the A/C is connected to a motion detector so the rooms get quite warm in the middle of the night making for an unpleasant sleep. 2) the food; for 500 to 1500/night I expect a lot more than a glorified, overpriced cafeteria as my main dining option. The optional breakfast bar is poorly laid out and overpriced for a muffin and a cup of coffee causing long, slow lines. 3) Where are the disney characters? Our first morning I catch a glimpse of mickey and take my little one to go get a picture but their is a line and the pictures are reserved for families dining at the breakfast buffett. We're going to eat in an hour or so but don't tell me my 3 year old can't go hug mickey at 7am at a DISNEY resort. The character breakfast was OK, both minny and goofy came around after an hour but I just expect more. Goofy did a thing at the pool which was cool and stich was seen a few times. Here's the summary, if I want to go to a beach resort, we go. I expect a great pool, laid back vacationing and some ocean activities. If I want a disney vacation I expect to be tripping over donald and the seven dwarves. Aulani misses both. The value is just not there. The crowded halls and hotubs, the average food and poor tables and the general lack of luxury make this a 'did it' and can't say we'll do it again. We'll spend our money at the Kahala, Turtle Bay or the Sheraton or one of our sister islands for a stay-cation, I just feel bad for those who fly across the ocean with children to stay here.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver", "Title": "\u201cBest Family Vacation\u201d", "Author": "4Fixs", "ReviewID": "UR127534968", "Content": "We just returned from Aulani after a 7 day vacation. Loved every moment of it. The service is excellent, every employee goes out of their way to help you and even have a conversation with you and your family. From the moment that you arrive to the moment that you leave, the customer service is excellent. We did rent a car and had to pay the $35.00 a day. Valet is included in that cost, we would just pull up and they would greet us and park the car. We never even had to walk into the parking garage. I would call down to the valet desk and we would walk down and there was our car ready for us. Our justification for this was we were able to save more money by going into town buying food at Costco or eating offsite. If you rent a car plan accordingly to the crazy traffic there. We even went out on a Saturday morning, the traffic was awful. Go to Pearl Harbor first thing in the morning, we left hotel at 6:30 (we were still on main land time). We missed the morning traffic and hit a little bit of the noon traffic on the way back. Guests at the hotel were saying they sat in traffic for hours. We were so lucky because of the times we choose to venture out. Diamond Head is a great site to visit, easy to walk up and beautiful views. Again, leave early, set your alarm clock. The food on the resort is expensive, but any resort or upscale hotel you stay in Hawaii is expensive with limited choices. We are a well traveled family, so I feel pretty confident stating this. The Disney is very subtle the magic is still there. We were there for 7 days and every day we discovered so many things, we loved it. Our kids begged us to go to Aunty's Beach House. We would have to just take them for an hour a day and wait so we could get them to stop asking. The Menehunes were a great addition to the resort. Kids loved looking for them and tell everyone at home about them. Ama Ama is good but not over the top. The view and sunset is worth having a nice family dinner there. The Character Breakfast was very good, we really enjoyed it. Make reservations way ahead of time so you are able to get in, you can always cancel them. It was windy while we were there, but it is a warm wind so we didn't mind at all. It is always windy in March in Hawaii. The beach was perfect for families, our kids loved it. The hotel rooms were awesome, we loved everything about it. We also had a small refrigerator that was pretty good size. We had a whole gallon of milk and a bunch of food in it. The spa is expensive, but it was so nice and relaxing. The staff there is also awesome. I am glad we experienced it, but I don't think I would pay the price a second time around. We purchased the drink mug for $18.00, well worth it. You can fill it up with coffee, soda anytime. Disney also provides water throughout the resort, which I thought was wonderful. I paid the hotel room rate for two double beds. For us it was expensive, but worth every penny. We usually stay at 5 star hotels, I thought the Disney Aulani was definitely a 5 star resort for FAMILIES. There is always activities going on that are free and they are a lot of fun. There are a lot of complaints about the expense, but you are paying for what you get. I think Disney includes a lot more for their price than any other hotel we have been in that price range. Also, the Kapolei area is beautiful. There is an ABC store right across the street that has great burger and fries specials for $8.99. They have a little market in there where you can buy items to eat and gifts to bring home. It is one of the nicest ABC stores I have ever been in. My kids cried when we got home and begged us to take them back. They just wanted two more days. :) Thank you Aulani for making my kids feel so special.

However, we felt the Aulani to be a more closed in feel, and we felt stressed out with all the chaos and activity. More open spaces at the Marriott and seemed slower pace. If I come back to Hawai'i I have no intention of going back to the Aulani. I am especially worried about what will be massive crowding at the pool area once the whole resort is completed and being used. Back to the Ama Ama... was busy and many people were turned away when they didn't have advanced plans. Get reservations people, and you won't be so disappointed! We were seated on time for our reservation but the service from our waiter was spotty. I had to beg to get my coffee refilled. That is a big deal for me when we go to expensive restaurants. My wife had macadamia nut pancakes and I had the Haupia French Toast. My kids had the Mickey Waffles. The best part of our meal was the papaya. Very well prepared and presented. The rest was impressive in presentation, but the taste just wasn't there. The pancakes were dry. The POG juice was good. My French Toast thing was just weird. Coffee was good when I was able to get some. Bottom line, as with the Disney Dream cruise ship, Disney yet again under emphasized their pool areas and as a result, the experience will suffer. I feel strongly that people ought never buy into a timeshare like DVC unless they have seen the property. This place is huge, busy and loud, out in the boonies without adequate airport shuttle service. Why does Disney do this so well in Florida but dropped the ball so badly in Hawai'i? Would it be so difficult for them to run shuttle service from the airport to the resort at a reasonable fee? Why make people rent cars that likely will mostly just sit in their parking facility?

I have never been to a resort where you pay for an umbrella. I can understand renting a cabana, but not an unmbrella. Rainbow reef seemed comparable to swimming in a fish tank, so we did not do that activity. Waterslides were fun for both our 7 year old and 3 year old. Rooms were quiet which was nice. Overall Aulani was nice, but it is Disney and you will pay for the \"Disney\" experience. Also, it was very windy, so be prepared when going to the pool and beach. Maybe it was just the time of the year, but it did get chilly when we were out of the water.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAulani is off the hook \"Brudda\"\u201d", "Author": "Boatlesspirate", "ReviewID": "UR127261610", "Content": "We just returned from an 8 day stay at Aulani. All I keep telling people is the place is off the hook. We have been DVC members for 5 years, and this by FAR is the best Disney vacation we have been on. Our twin 5 year olds, our 11 year old daughter, my wife and myself all cannot wait to go back. Yes, this is a new hotel, and yes there are a few growing pains (see below), but the staff went out of there way to make this an incredible trip. I always love reading trip advisor for the complainers, but I\u2019ll comment on them below. Travel from HNL is a breeze! Yes you do need a car, or expect to pay for an expensive cab ride. To the poster who said they got lost, really? Um, you take H1 West, and get off at the Ko\u2019 Olina exit-it\u2019s that easy. The trip with 5 pm traffic took 35 minutes. If this is your first trip to Hawaii, or you have been to other islands like Maui or Kauai, this is O\u2019ahu and Honolulu, it\u2019s an urbanized city. The island is beautiful, but it is more industrialized. Aulani is on the west side, once you enter the Ko\u2019Olina grounds, it\u2019s gorgeous and very secure. Check in. What can I say? After you pick your jaw up off the floor, we were immediately greeted with fresh drinks and lei\u2019s. Our personal greeter was waiting for us as we did advanced check in (highly recommended) and gave us a brief, but stunning introduction to the hotel lobby, and the unbelievable view of the Waikolohe Valley. In typical Disney fashion, this is off the hook beautiful. We were handed our keys, and our bags were at our room in mintues. We had a two bedroom DVC room, with an Ocean View. As others have mentioned, what Disney calls an Ocean view means you can SEE the ocean from your room. The only Ocean FRONT rooms our the end grand villas. Mind you, our view was stunning as it overlooked the valley pool area and the ocean/bay from the 11th floor (be aware of this and ask before you get there). The view during the day and night will take your breath away. The suite was as large as the rooms at DVC Kidani Village, but much much brighter. Our kitchen came well stocked, and the layout is huge! My wife is a bed SNOB and said it was uber comfortable. As the rooms are fairly new, they were spotless and flawless. The showers include both a rain head, as well as what I call, a power washer. The two bedrooms include a lanai, and a private lanai off the master. Nice touch Disney!! The grounds are immaculate. Disney did an incredible job with foliage and flowers, and we saw someone maintaining every area of it daily. Your kids will have a blast finding all the hidden menehune everywhere and the animals secretly carved in the rocks. Aulani shares the lagoon with the JW Marriot, and a little wedding chapel. The sand is perfect with almost no stones. As the waves break through the lagoon entrance, there is very little wake and the water does not get deep for several feet out. We saw toddlers playing effortlessly in the ocean water. Here you can rent boogie boards, stand up paddle boards (my daughter loved), and snorkel gear. For those that don\u2019t want to pay for rainbow reef (see below), there are many fish along the lagoon entrance, and we saw a few turtles eating there daily. Um, personal tip, don\u2019t swim through the rip tide area (roped off). Trust me on that one. Otherwise the lagoon is perfectly safe for everyone. *** Secret tip- walk past the JW Marriot and there is a secret beach. The kids will love the tidal pools and all the little crabs. We were told at dusk the turtles actually come up to shore. Also, the kids can rent a Menehune trail little iPhone doo-dad that is really neat. It is wi-fi and \u201cAunty\u201d takes you on adventures all over Aulani, with lot\u2019s of special effects. There are 4-5 indoor and outdoor tours using this, and after two hours I made the twins stop as Daddy was pooped!! The pool, the lazy river, the slides, and the Menehune Bridge are wonderful. Saturday and Sunday get packed, but otherwise I never felt the pool itself to be over crowded. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a slide. It took all week to get the 5 year olds on the body slide, and then we could not get them off (go figure). The lazy river is great and very LAZY, be prepared for a few surprises. Ok, let\u2019s discuss the chair situation. Yes, if you do not get a chair by 10 a.m., you will not get one by the pool. There are several away from the pool, and MANY at the beach (as in no problem), but poolside, forget it. To the complainers, I have a few comments 1) get your lazy butt to the pool early 2) don\u2019t assume if a chair is empty it\u2019s not being used. We weren\u2019t chair hogs. We used two chairs for 5 of us, but mind you we were all over the pool area doing things. For those that have never been to a Disney pool, the life guards are the best in the world. The pool water was a little cool, but was a relief when the hot sun was at it\u2019s peak. Aunty\u2019s Beach House, to quote my kids is \u201cthe best place in the world!!\u201d As a parent, I couldn\u2019t agree more. It\u2019s a full size mock up of a ranch house, and each room has a theme (tv room, garage, kitchen, living room). It\u2019s open 10-10 which not only give the adults a break (yes they will feed them too), but allows you to sneak away if need be. The twins were there for 5 hours while my wife and daughter took surf lessons, and when we went to get them, they didn\u2019t want to leave. They begged to go there everyday. Although it\u2019s free, they do have paid activities like Chip and Dales Party, which the kids love. Also, the security is stellar. They have adults posted everywhere, your kids are tagged and they monitor their whereabouts constantly. You cannot remove your kids without a room key, an alpha and numeric pass code. Top Notch Disney!! Bottom line, the food and drinks are expensive. Our first night, we got two fish tacos boxes, a pulled pork sandwich, and a hamburger. $67 and the food was \u201ceh.\u201d So, what to do? Well, first, many off the appetizers which you can order poolside are big and reasonable. Sushi heads can order fresh sashimi for $15, not bad at all! We did eat at Ama\u2019 Ama\u2019 our last night. Yes, it was pricey, but the view and the food were amazing. We did the character buffet for breakfast, and the food was VERY good and very plentiful. There is a plaza across the street with a taco joint (good drinks, crappy food), a cute ice-cream shop that serves some food, and an ABC store where you can get deli food (sandwiches, hot and cold food, etc.) pretty reasonable. Best bet is Kapolei 5 minutes up the road. There is a Safeway, Target, and a Costco (good poke!!) and many fast food and Cheap sushi places. We went to Genke which is a sushi conveyor place and ate like PIGS for $60. My daughter and I drove down the road one day and found a shrimp truck and a roadside chicken grill, very very good (thanks again Mama!!). Honolulu is 35 min away. Sansei sushi (best in the world!!) is a must as well as breakfast at Eggs-n-things (macadamia pancakes & Moco Loco mmmmm). Also, you must get malasadas from Leonard\u2019s and must must must go to Puka (now Hula) Dog in Waikiki. We never made it to the North Shore because the kids didn\u2019t want to leave. We did the Paradise Luau walking distance down the street. Good show, food was so so. Don\u2019t buy tickets from them, you can find them cheaper on-line. Oh, don\u2019t forget the shaved iced on property. YUM! Although we did not do any of the Disney excursions, there is a lot to do on the island. For snorkeling/scuba (besides the lagoon), there is \u201cElectric Beach\u201d 5 minutes up the road. Millions of fish and turtles, and sometimes dolphins. We also did Pearl Harbor and Diamond Head (tough hike, but well worth the view, and then you can go to Puka Dog 5 min away). We would have done more, but we really found so much to do. If you want to surf, I recommend Girls Who Surf (10 minutes away). They were awesome!!! My 11 year old was up by the 3rd run! We did buy the Rainbow Reef pass for the week for my wife, daughter, and me. If you go twice it\u2019s worth it. The twins both did it one day, and although they only went around once, they had a blast. Get an underwater camera. Even non-snorkelers can do it. The wife and I never made it to the spa, but it looked incredible. My daughter loved the teen spa, and made many friends. The twins loved the outdoor movie, and the menehune trail. Uncle Ito and his fireside story telling was really neat. He is so funny and a wealth of information (now I know that some poi is good). Everyone was very kind, very helpful, and very proud of their home. Only complaint. Aulani did send a note saying there would be construction by the pool for a new food area. They did not mention they would be jack hammering for 3 days. Was more of a nuisance as we went to the beach when that occurred, but just poor timing on Disney\u2019s part. But Disney did make up for it (polite comments and concerns get you everywhere with Disney). All in all, Aulani FAR exceeded our expectations. My wife and kids actually cried when we left. Yes it\u2019s expensive, it is Hawaii folks. But you get what you pay for. If you just want Hawaii paradise, go to Maui. If you want to have a week of beauty and have lots of fun too, Aulani is a perfect vacation!", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vestavia Hills, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cAlmost Paradise\u201d", "Author": "hammerangel", "ReviewID": "UR127248313", "Content": "The Challenge. Spring Break as a family of 4 with a High School Senior and Freshman. The Experience. Steps before passing through the main entrance, each of us were individually greeted with gift, and a beautiful smile. A few more steps, the doors to the lobby opened and we are enveloped by a wonderful tropical breeze and an awe inspiring view. The pools, slides, lazy river and beach area are world class. The sunsets from our balcony were breathtaking. In the evening, the sounds of Hawaiian music being ushered through our open balcony door will be remembered for a lifetime. In my opinion, the room with the right view made our stay exceptional. The spa was nothing I have ever experienced - something that you must experience. Our family spa treatment will be remembered forever. Like many of you, I read a lot of reviews on tripadvisor and agree with some complaints. The food at the resort is extremely expensive. The only walk up food service-One Paddle Two Paddle-was only available from 5-8 p.m. I hope Disney reads these reviews and address this issue. It is mentioned in most reviews. To overcome this obstacle, I would highly suggest having a rental car and stocking up at Target or Costco just a few miles away. Also, the ABC store just across the street is a great place for groceries, sandwiches and hot meals. They have a wide selection at reasonable prices. If I had a do-over, which I hope to do soon, I would have stayed at the Aulani for 4 days and spent the rest of our time in Maui. Most people I have talked with suggest island hopping.

We had planned on spending a lot of time away ffrom the resort doing other activities, but we ended up spending the majority of our time at the resort because it was so comfortable and relaxing. We traveled to a couple of other beaches during our trip and only stayed for short periods of time because the beach at the resort was so nice. This was our most relaxing trip. Some people have complained about the number of chairs on the beach, but our second day there they received another shipment of chairs and once those arrived there were always a lot of empty chairs. We were told that the week we were there the resort was at capacity, but it never felt crowded. The beach is very large and the resort has its own lagoon. They have ropes for swimmers and when we swan out past the ropes we saw lots of colorful fish snorkeling. We had planned on snorkeling elsewhere, but after we saw the number of fish in the ocean right in front of the resort we didn't need to go anywhere else. Also, they have an enormous infinity hot tub that we sat in every night and looked out over the ocean. This staff was the friendliest staff we have encountered at a resort from the front desk clerks, to the servers and the housekeepers. They were constantly cleaning eveything. I couldn't believe how comforatable and clean the resort was. They had music outside every night by the pool and bars which were local musicians.

It was just the right amount of Disney. I LOVED the Starlit Hui, which is their version of a luau without the food. The music and performances were wonderful. We went to a luau next door at the Paradise Cove and I much preferred the Starlit Hui. It was more intimate and kid friendly. The service was wonderful and I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I know there are plans to complete more dining options which is needed. Aside from that, our trip was perfect.

You can tell its \"new\", but has lots of potential\u201d", "Author": "tpappy", "ReviewID": "UR127144256", "Content": "I looked forward to this trip for months. In fact, the week leading up to the trip, I had nothing else on my mind. I traveled here with my 2-yr old daughter and my husband a few weeks ago for 5 nights. We were joined by a friend of mine, her husband, and two boys (1.5 year old and 3.5 year old). We had a wonderful time, but the hotel definitely fell short on some of our expectations. Essentially, you are paying 5-star hotel prices, but are getting 3-star delivery on service and food. I am idealistic that the primary reason for this is because the hotel is still new and is still getting its bearings. I read so many reviews about this hotel, but you are never really prepared or fully trusting of others until you arrive and experience it on your own. I have broken out my review in various categories\u2026 GROUNDS: The grounds are stunning; the architecture is beautiful. You can see the two worlds meet (Hawaii & Disney). Just as I read beforehand, the \u201cDisney-ness\u201d is so subtle, except for the few Disney characters you see from time to time, it\u2019s just like any other beach resort. When you look at the property at night from your balcony, it is almost looks magical. The lobby area (main building) is probably the nicest I have seen in a beach resort, especially when it is lit up. As you approach the hotel from the highway, you only see two other dated properties on either. It\u2019s either that those properties are under-whelming or Disney has done a great job of standing out next two these 2 Marriott properties. When I walked in, I felt like a kid walking into Disneyland for the 1st time. And not because of anything \u201cDisney\u201d, it was just captivating. We were greeted by someone carrying leis and calling us by our last name (which was the first and last time they remembered our name). I was so excited about what awaited me, just from getting the first glimpse at the lobby. I saw that same reaction on many of the guests\u2019 faces throughout my visit whenever I walked through the lobby entrance. POOLS: The place is huge, but not Vegas huge. The pools, lazy river, rainbow reef, slides, etc are all orchestrated perfectly. Although, sometimes, I felt like I was in a maze. Now, for the bad news, the pool water was too cold and the poolside service was average at the best. You would think they would heat the pools (especially when it's cold and windy) since it is full of kids. My daughter caught a cold on the 2nd day of our trip. Poolside service does not start till 11:00 am. There is no food or snacks available till 11:00 am. You have to walk to the bar to get a drink. Sure, it\u2019s a bit early for drinking, but I am from L.A. and there is a 3 hour time difference so I was ready at 10:00 am to get my drink on. When you walk to the bar, you can only order 1 alcoholic drink at a time if you are alone. Their answer - \"Hawaii state law\". So, if I wanted to order a drink for my husband and myself and he was busy with my daughter in the pool, I had to walk back and forth twice. Not very fun to do on vacation when trying to catch some sun. The bar also had no snacks. Finally at 11:00 am, the \u201cfew\u201d waitresses start appearing. The pools had 10 times more lifeguards than they did service staff. I know the hotel prides itself on safety, but come on; they need to add more service staff. Another lame rule I had never heard of before, was that if you were not using your lounge chair for over 60 minutes, they would remove your belongings so that others can use the chair. In reality, I never saw them enforce this, but I thought it was a funny rule. FOOD: The food was average at best and choices were limited. We pretty much tried everything on the menu during our stay and none of it was memorable. The only item that was tasty was the \"catch of the day\" tacos. My daughter ate chicken fingers everyday. I am not even going to complain about the price here, because all hotels \"get you\" on the poolside food and drinks. I accepted that a long time ago. The buffet Character Breakfast was fun and entertaining for the kids, but again, the food was sub par given the prices we were paying. We also ate at Ama Ama. Not impressed at all. The kids\u2019 food was better than the adult food. Just as other reviews suggested, I recommend visiting Target or the nearby ABC store to grab some groceries. The lobby of the hotel does have a little souveneir/convenient store, but again very expensive. BEACH: The beach was beautiful, clean, and waters were calmer than most oceans I have been too. I read about that beforehand and was excited to take my toddler in. However, they had no beachside service. You had to find your own lounge chairs and grab them from a stack. They had maybe 4 permanent umbrellas. If those were taken, you could rent one for $15.00 (half day price). If you wanted food or drinks, you had to walk up to the pool. When I asked some of the employees why there was no beachside service, they said they tried it in the beginning and it didn't work well. Hopefully, they will figure it out and bring it back. AUNTIE\u2019S BEACH HOUSE: One of the coolest children\u2019s\u2019 play areas I have seen. It\u2019s a good size too; huge outdoor play area with playground type toys. The one personal drawback for me was that I could only utilize this place from 8:00 am to 10:00 am daily. After that, kids under 3 year olds were not allowed. They should add another time slot for toddlers in the afternoon. It was nice to have a safe, contained area for kids to play. ACTIVITIES: You have to give credit where credit is due. The hotel does a great job of organizing various activities. Every evening, they drop off a newsletter in your room, which contains general information, weather, and the next day\u2019s activities (color coordinated for different ages, times, etc). I was impressed by the information provided and actually used it to plan our day/nights. Unfortunately, our kids were too young for most of the activities. ROOM: We stayed in the \u201cbest\u201d accommodation the resort has, which was a 2-bedroom ocean view villa. It was nice, but not as nice as advertised. Smaller than expected and it should not be called a villa, more like a 2-bedroom suite. The word \u201cvilla\u201d gives you the impression that it is a stand alone property. It had more of a pool view although you can clearly see the ocean too. That being said, the room was spotless with a very nice kitchen. We made breakfast almost every morning in the room. The dining was banquette seating so perfect for young children. Added perks that you typically do not see (but we didn\u2019t really use) were the highchair, laundry machines and basket, and a pack n play. I requested that they clean our rooms before noon every day so that we can go back up for nap time (and it was done). The villa had two balconies; 1 in the main living area and another in the master (which is my family stayed in). The one other little issue I had with the room was the shampoo, conditioner, etc bottles, were so hard to squeeze anything out. When we requested more or towels, etc, it took forever to get it brought up. If you are checking out on a Sunday like us, make sure to call 30 minutes ahead of time for a bell boy, otherwise, you are out of luck. Would I come back here? Would I recommend this hotel to others? Will I come back here? Absolutely, but in a few years. I would especially recommend this hotel to those with kids in the age range of 5-13. If any kid in that age range was asked to right a review, they would sing praises all day long. It appears that the hotel perceives their customer to be this child and not the parent (who plans and pays for the trip). That being said, I get the feeling that the hotel is only going to get better. Impossible for them to \u201cget worse\u201d with a name like Disney attached to it. The items that need improvement are staffing, service, and food. Just witnessing my daughter\u2019s excitement in the water park or at the beach or running into Mickey Mouse was worth the trip and the money we paid for it.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pearl City, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGreat Fun for the Whole Family!\u201d", "Author": "kharada46", "ReviewID": "UR127113228", "Content": "Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa is a resort hotel and Disney Vacation Club location in the Ko'olina Resort on the Leeward (West) Coast of Oahu, Hawaii. It is located right next to the JW Marriott Ihilani Resort & Spa, but unlike it's neighbor, Aulani focuses on families. This can be a good thing, but can also be a bad thing, as there's something for everyone, but it also means there are a lot of noisy kids! Anyhow, my fiancee and I had our first official stay at Aulani this past February. We are DVC members, so my review will be for DVC type rooms rather than the standard hotel room. That being said, Aulani is a family luxury resort by Disney that aims to present the culture of Hawaii to visitors. When you first arrive, you will be greeted with a kukui nut lei for men and flower lei for women, as well as some waters. You will then be lead into the lobby where you are given a brief tour. You will then be lead to the front desk to check in. Despite being 3 hours early (because we had an appointment at Laniwai), our room was already ready and we headed on up. When we got there, we called the bellmen and our bags were delivered to us shortly after that. Our room for this stay was a DVC Ocean View studio. Ocean view here denotes \"partial view of the ocean,\" which is basically what we got. We were on the 6th floor of the tower immediately adjacent (to the east) of the lobby. So the view off our balcony was of the entire resort with the ocean just beyond the \"volcano\" and the trees. The room itself is a little on the smallish side, with a queen size bed, a sofa, a small table with two chairs, and a LCD HDTV. The balcony was also pretty small and had a small table with two small chairs. Like the rest of the room, the bathroom was a little small, with a very shallow tub, a rain shower head, a single vanity, and a separate toilet. Toiletries provided were excellent H2O+ brand, which they also sell in Kalepa's and at Laniwai. Our room also contained a small wet bar, utensils (including wine key & chopsticks), an electric kettle, a toaster, a half size fridge, a microwave, and dishes. This is the primary difference between a DVC studio and a standard hotel room. The property itself is very nice, with the mountains representing mountains and the pool system, the Waikolohe Valley, representing a tract of land from the mountain to the sea known as an ahapua'a. The pool system consists of a large main pool, a lazy river, and two slides. There's also an adult only pool by Laniwai (even though there were still kids in it), a saltwater pool stocked with reef fish for snorkeling, a stingray interaction pool (Makai Preserve), and the Makaloa wedding lawn. Aulani also has a bunch of dinning options, including: Ama Ama (fine dining), Makahiki (buffet), Off the Hook (poolside), Olelo Room (bar), One Paddle Two Paddle (quick service), Lava Shack (gifts & cold quick service), a shaved ice stand, and a frozen yogurt bar. We've tried virtually all of the eateries here, however, I will reserve my comments on them for their own reviews. We also tried out Laniwai (spa) during our stay, which I will write a separate review for as well. As you might expect, the resort is pretty noisy. However, the glass doors for the room are quite substantial and blocked out virtually all the noise coming from the building exterior. The interiors of the rooms are insulated as great and we could often here people in the hallways and in the room next-door quite clearly. The bed was also a little more still than I'm used to and the linens were a little scratchy as well. My biggest complaint, though, is that the water pressure from the shower doesn't seem to be ample in my opinion. Overall, though, the room is nice and well kept. Not the best I've been in, but definitely nowhere near the worst either. The staff at Aulani were all quite friendly from our experience, though there were some hiccups. The worst was the lifeguards at Rainbow Reef (snorkeling) that were complaining about working and saying how stupid it was that people actually paid money for the experience (partially true, as $20 is a bit much to snorkel around a small man-made saltwater pool).

I'd recommend the rainbow reef for one visit, as the snorkeling is novel, with lots of colourful fish; but you do get the sense that it's a bit artificial (and expensive, $20 for adults and $15 for kids; there's also the option to get a whole stay pass, but one visit was enough for us). The lagoon doesn't have the same amount of fish or variety, but a beautiful sand beach makes it a great place. A better beach is the public beach in Ko Olina just off the parking lot of the Paradise cove luau, where several turles swim with you. We did the Makai preserve to visit the sting rays. A great program, where you learn about the rays, touch them and feed them. It's not cheap (I think $45-50/person), but a worthwhile charitable cause and experience. The food is okay. The character breakfast is worthwhile to do, but typical breakfast food. The dinner buffet was good too. We avoided AMA AMA only because of mediocre reviews. While using the water facilities, it was very convenient to get a drink, snacks and food from the various bars, snack shops, and shave ice stall. Aunty's beach house was an impressive building with lots of things for kids of all ages to keep them occupied. We didn't do any of the premium experiences for the kids only because we had so much else to do. There is also a tween/teen room called Painted Sky for that age group too, which got great reviews from two tweens travelling with us. The spa is outstanding (but that is for another review) and worth a visit to access it's full facilities. One concern is that we learned that only 2/3 of the resort rooms are open, and an entire wing of the hotel is not yet open! Already, the water facilities (which are all located in the centre of the resort surrounded by the towers) felt fairly crowded, as you'd be challenged to find an open pool chair in the afternoon. All in all, we will definitely return to Aulani, although likely break it up to maybe stay somewhere with a kitchen, as we're not DVC members and did not have access to the villas. Having a kitchen would have changed our stay, as we would have done a convenient Costco/Safeway/Target run that's a five minute drive away in Kapolei.

We belong to a couple of time-share resorts and the Disney Vacation Club (DVC) in Hawaii was the latest on our list of places we \u201cneeded\u201d to visit. Disney's Aulani in Kapolei, Oahu is sandwiched between the Marriot Beach Club and the JW Marriott about 30 minutes outside of Honolulu. All three of these resorts have their own man-made private lagoons that are absolutely beautiful and immaculately maintained at the level you would expect, for the price you are paying. We had the pleasure of staying at the Marriot Beach Club in 2010 and now the Disney property in Kapolei this past 2011 and we can't wait to plan our next trip back to either of these places since we are members at both of these properties. Are we spoiled or what? Our most recent trip to Disney\u2019s Aulani was almost perfect. I say almost since we did go just after this property opened in September of 2011 and they weren't quite ready to give you the 100% pampered and restful experience you would expect of the more mature time-share property; as they had only been opened for 2 months at that point. I also have to say I was a little concerned prior to our trip with regard to visiting a \u201cDisney\u201d type property; after all we were all mature adults that were going (ages 29-58). I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if we would get to have any kind of peaceful stay. I am happy to report that my concern was unfounded and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the kids were indeed seen everywhere, but they were not an issue with regard to noise or annoyance. We arrived mid-day on Sunday, checked into our 2 bedroom suite, unpacked and headed off to Costco and the local Safeway to shop for the weeks provisions. When learned on our visit in 2010, in order to help control costs and truly enjoy other entertainment available to you during your stay, you were going to have to cook for yourself in the full kitchens that both these time-share properties have to offer you. This was a sacrifice well worth the effort. So after purchasing our provisions we headed back to our room, put everything away and sat on our balcony enjoying a cocktail and watching the sun set. Sunsets here were phenomenal! The next morning we opened our lanai doors to an awesome view of the Disney lazy river and lagoon only to have to listen to jackhammers pounding away. It was like this the entire stay. My husband finally called the front desk on Wednesday to find out how long we were going to have to endure this nuisance and was told this was planned for the duration of our stay (8AM-5PM, but they had weekends off) and by the way, barbeques would be installed sometime in February. The rooms were beautiful and had all the items you come to expect from a timeshare. We had a full kitchen and dining room as well as an in-unit stackable washer/dryer. The one and only downfall for us was we had nowhere on the property to barbeque like we did when we went to the Beach Club back in 2010. So our steaks were broiled in the oven; and essentially ruined by my standards. Despite the noise nuisance as well as the lacking barbeque features, our stay was well worth the money and is something we will be planning again for sometime in 2013.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westampton, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cParadise on earth....\u201d", "Author": "JerseyBrown", "ReviewID": "UR127017567", "Content": "This resort is beautiful.

It's gorgeous! Disney really went all out and built a stunning resort. One thing to note is more than half the rooms are DVC and not the actual hotel, also the hotel tower is actually in the back of the property and has the worst views of the rooms available. This resort definitely caters more toward the Disney Vacation Club than the hotel portion. That shouldn't deter anyone, but it's something to keep in mind. Aulani is located in Ko Olina, a beautiful area about 30 minutes outside Waikiki, and I really like the area. It feels very upscale, safe and beautifully manicured. Ko Olina could use some more restaurants, but other than that it's really nice. I noticed that when it rained on other parts of the island, it didn't rain in Ko Olina, it was perfect weather the entire time we were there, even though portions of Oahu were having poor weather. Seems like Ko Olina is in a protected area with amazing weather! The cove Aulani sits on is perfect for swimming and for kids, soft sand beach, water is calm, no big waves, and if you swim out to the center, there's some pretty decent snorkeling opportunities too, with the rocks and colorful fish. Plenty of beach chairs available, and the hotel has a gorgeous sunset view, something a lot of places in Hawaii don't have. The pools are gorgeous, there is one small infinity pool designed to have the perfect sunset view, perfect design. There is another pool that's off to the side that is much quieter and peaceful, I would almost call it the \"adult\" pool, but kids are welcome, but it needs to be quiet here. The main pool is huge and connects with the lazy river and slides and has zero entry which is perfect for kids. There are TONS of pool chairs, but I noticed row after row after row of pool chairs that were \"claimed\" by towels and other items, but nobody was actually using those chairs. It seemed a bit unfair that so many guests were claiming so many pool chairs they were not using and it was hard to find an open pool chair during certain portions of the day. There were plenty of chairs, but so many people had claimed chairs they weren't using and it was annoying. The lazy river is beautiful and 3' deep, and winds around the pool and property. Oh and you have to have a bracelet to use the pools, and be a guest at Disney to use them. You CAN NOT come to Aulani and buy a guest pass to use them, the pools and lazy river are for Aulani guests ONLY. The restaurants and shop are open to the public, but not the pools. Service. . .is interesting. Every single person I met who worked at Disney was an absolute pleasure, Disney has hired some truly nice and personable people who embody the Hawaiian hospitality and spirit. That said, there is a feeling of \"island time\", nobody is in a rush, there is no fire to light under anyone, you are on their time line not yours, and that is very different from every other Disney hotels and theme park. Restaurants are also interesting. Ama Ama has the most wonderful view of the cove, truly beautiful, and I really enjoyed the plate lunch special I got, it was a mixed bag of lots of Hawaiian specialties. Cost is typical disney, higher than you would pay for equivalent food elsewhere. If you know Disney, you should expect this. Brittany our waitress was one of our favorites, really nice and personable. But it did seem like at peak times the restaurants were understaffed and unable to handle the capacity. Also, getting a reservation to any restaurant on property is difficult, especially the character breakfast (book way in advance). I've been to the Vero Beach Disney Vacation Club which has two restaurants, and the Hilton Head DVC which has I think 1 restaurant, and getting food was never a problem at those resorts, but it is here at Aulani which has FOUR restaurants! I think part of the issue, is we as guests are not leaving the resort to dine or do other activities, like we do at other DVC locations. I didn't want to leave Aulani, where as in Hilton Head or Vero beach DVC, we couldn't wait to explore and check out the surrounding areas. It's a testament to how beautiful the property and resort are, but also it creates a food shortage for guests which is not awesome. And I think another tower of DVC units has yet to open yet, which could present an even deeper problem for the restaurants. I did notice they are building a new restaurant to try to alleviate the back up, but it's not finished yet. Again, it's interesting! The rooms themselves are standard Disney, nice but nothing to write home about, and well, expensive. But you are paying to stay at a gorgeous resort property, not in the room. Husband really enjoyed the golf course across the street, said it was one of the prettiest golf courses he's ever played.

As we all know, any evaluation is in the eye of the beholder. In the case of the Aulani, this is definitely the case. So for anyone going to stay there they should think about what their expectations are before they book this resort. Some background information: I have traveled all over the world and stayed in 5 star plus places and some rat holes so I have a wide range of experience in resorts and hotels. Also I have been a Disney Vacation Club (DVC) member for 10 years and have stayed at a lot of Disney Resorts and my daughter worked at Disney World and I spent a lot of time visiting her and gaining a perspective regarding Disney properties. So if you expect Aulani to be on the same level as a Disney World property you will need to scale down your expectations. Perhaps my Aulani experience might be of help to you: * Quality of: ** Resort Rooms: stayed in a room on the 5th floor overlooking the parking area (5th floor is actually only two floors above the 1st parking level). View does look out toward the hills which was a decent view. Bottom line the quality of the room was very good and very quiet even looking out over the parking garage. I did not stay in the DVC timeshare rooms during this trip because this was a business trip as well as a vacation opportunity. ***Managing Expectations: The room was of very good quaility and the maid service was very good. So if you don't plan to spend much time in your room then it really doesn't matter where the room is. If you plan to spend most of the time at the resort then the room takes on more importantance. Then you should consider the DVC rooms because of the space and kitchens or request a room with a better view than the parking area. ** Resort Staff: This can vary widely if you want help prior to arriving or you talk with the staff when you are on site. It is virtually impossible to call the Aulani Resort prior to your trip and get any timely response. I had called them many times before I arrived and I never got through to anyone without waiting and waiting and waiting. Also you can get different responses depending on whom you talk with since their staff may not have much experience. For example, after reading a number of posts it was not clear about the parking costs at the Aulani if you were a DVC member. I called the resort and after an extensvie wait was told that you could park free if you were a DVC member. Well that is not the case.....you must have rented your room under your DVC membership which I had not done. Once you get to the resort the quaility of the staff increases signicantly and is more like the Disney quality you expect. ***Managing expecations: Like it or not until they add more staff to answer phones and ensure their staff know what they are doing you will be frustrated. Couple of suggestions: first call early in the morning (Hawaii time) when they are not so busy and if you don't get a satisficatory answer ask to speak to a supervisor. Also if you are going to use a travel agent to book your trip make sure you ask them the questions and let them get frustrated by the slow response. At least you will shift the time burden to the travel agent and they will earn their money this way and perhaps let Disney know they are not providing a decent response to their custormers. **Restaurants: Some food was very good and some was just OK but in all cases expensive. However, there are several places across the main road to the East that are within walking distance of the resort where you can go for sandwiches, ice cream, and things to bring back to the room. Also the \"drink cups\" at the resort can save you some money depending how long you are there....they are around$19 or so but they can be continuously refilled with coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and soft drinks. As noted by others, if you have a car you can go to the town of Kapolei which is about a 15 minute drive and they have a Target, Denny's , McDonalds, etc. which can offset the costs at the Aulani restaurants. ***Managing expectations: For the most part it is very expensive in Hawaii. So for upper scale and some mid range restaurants be prepared for high costs no matter the quality of the restaurants. You can find decent restaurants that charge reasonable costs if you look hard enough but you have to look however do you want to spend your time searching for them ......probably not so be prepared to pay a higher cost for food such as you might in New York, London, etc. If cost is a concern then plan on buying some snacks offsite to reduce your costs. ** Things to do at the Aulani: Relax: Aulani is a very good place to just lay back and relax and enjoy some of the entertainment (ranges from OK to very good) that they have. Pools and beaches: Very good water activities (especially the lazy river, and an excellent beach and bay area) and other things for kids. So the kids will really be entertained and adults somewhat. Bars: Drinks were better than the J W Marriott next door and cost about the same. I have read just the opposite in other postings so maybe the Aulani has gotten the message or we just had a better bartender that knew how to make the drinks. ***Managing expectations: Does not compare to Disney Resorts in the US, Japan, or France however it was not intended to. So when you go to the Aulani think about it strictly as a hotel where you can relax and has upscale water activites which is a great thing for kids and of course some adults. ** Location: Anyone that does not know much about Oahu should spend some time thinking about what they want to do prior to making reservations. The Aulani is on the West side of the island and is great for making excursions to the West Side (Wai'anae, Malli, Makaha areas), Center of the Island (Schofield Barracks, Wheeler Field, Dole Plantation), North Side (Hale'wa, Kawailoa Beach, Waimea Bay, Banzai Pipeline, Kawela Bay, and the Polynesian Cultural Center - it is on the North East side but you don't have to go through Honolulu to get there). However from the Aulani it can be a very time consuming drive to get to the Honolulu area. The rush hour traffic can be a real pain since the H1 is the main road from the Aulani to Honolulu. We drove to the Honolulu area 6 days out of 7 and tried to plan the drives early in the morning or late in the evening but it didn't make a lot of difference. It seems out of 800,000 people most of them are always on the roads from 6 am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm. ***Managing expectations: Expect lots of traffic if you are going to be on the road to any of the attractions in Honolulu, going on whale watching trips, or island hopping. Also you may run into some delay because of accidents....people seem to drive pretty erratically. A suggestion would be to organize your hotel around what you plan to do and see. If a lot of your focus is on the Honolulu area it might be worth staying in Honolulu. On the other hand, if you want to just relax with a few excursions which take you to Honolulu then the Aulani would be a reasonable choice. Also if you have kids and don't plan on going to Honolulu the Alulani makes a good choice. TIP ON GOING TO PEARL HARBOUR: In March of this year, the US Parks & Recreation sevice establishied a new online reservation system for Pearl Harbor. We took advantage of that and therefore eliminated the long wait and also having to arrive really early to get tickets.

We rented a car at the airport and the resort was difficult to find because there were no signs along the freeway saying the resort was up ahead or which exit to use. We're members of the Disney Vacation Club and used a premium number of points for an \"Ocean View\" room with two bedrooms for five nights, making reservations a good five months before we arrived. We checked in after dark, and when we woke up, we could see the ocean, but first we had look beyond the parking garage and hotel of the resort next door, a very dissapointing non-premium room. When I went to the desk to ask for a different room, I was told that the room did have an ocean view. After I did not respond to that comment, the desk person chuckled and said he understood. He said they were going to try and get the rooms on that side of the hotel re-classified as non-premium. He offered two other rooms, one on a floor below our original floor, and one a floor above. When I asked for his opinion, he suggested the floor above, but both rooms had a great view of the ocean and pool area. I accepted his recommendation, but should have asked to see the room. I was told that we would have to wait an additional night before the room would be ready. We checked out the next morning, checked our luggage and went touring on the island, returning in the afternoon to our room. Something about the room seemed out of the ordinary when we walked in and when we looked at the master bath we realized that it was a handicap accessible room, meaning everything in the kitchen area, master bedroom and bathroom were built much lower to make it more accessible. We didn't think it would be a problem, until we showered the next day. The water ran out the shower even though we had placed a couple of towels to try and prevent that from happening. This produced a small river that went through the sink area and eventually ended up as a small pond in the toilet area. Because of the limitations on the number of towels we could use without having to pay for more, we did the best we could, but my wife couldn't use the sink area to blow dry her hair because of all the water. My point is that if the desk clerk had told me about these issues with the room, I would have taken the other room. I feel that the number of points used for the first two nights was excessive for what I received and expected, and the desk clerk should have mentioned that it was a handicap accessible room. We expected prices to be higher in general while on the island, but also felt that the buffet on site was not a good value for what we paid, very expensive for mediocre food. My wife and I enjoyed a couples massage at the spa which we enjoyed very much and would do that again. The beach was good, and the pool complex was also good. Location of the resort itself was fine with us, about one half hour away from the shopping area in Honolulu, we didn't need to be right downtown.

I don't think people understand how valuable this service is. Disney adopted the idea from its Disney Cruise Line. We have stayed at the Marriott next door and we paid $27 per hour for on-site baby sitting. Aunty's is included in the price of your room. The kids were able to eat at Aunty's for around $7. The provided many activities for the children to do and this kids never wanted to leave. I read a lot of feedback about the food at Aulani. Most are true. The food is not that great but I believe they are working on this. Island Country Store is right across the street as well as a Hawaiian BBQ, Just Tacos and a Sushi joint. You should buy the refillable mug for $20. It might seem steeply priced at first but you really do get your money's worth. You get unlimited soda, tea, hot chocolate and coffee for the length of your stay with this purchase. All I can say is rent a car. We were able to rent a full size car for ten days for $220. This is very reasonable. DVC members get two free parking spots per reservation so we did not pay for parking. There are many, many stores within five minutes of the resort so people should not be complaining about how there is nothing around. Overall, this is place is great! You have to remember that this is not Waikiki. That's why we like it and we chose to come here. You just have to have realistic expectations.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kapolei, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cLove the Aulani!\u201d", "Author": "Cpalyo", "ReviewID": "UR126574409", "Content": "My family absolutely loved the Aulani!

We thankfully missed the torrential rains by one day. The property is beautiful with breathtaking views of the beach. Ko Olina itself is gorgeous. In terms of outside food and amenities, there is a Target, Pizza Hut, and McDonalds two exits down (less than ten minute drive). Much cheaper than the resort restaurants and market across the street. FYI for those with food allergies, the market and smaller restaurants across the street from the resort aren't well versed with what ingredients/oils are used in their food. Aulani hotel rooms are clean, well equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, and electric water kettle. The rooms are standard in size. The pools are fantastic - deepest area is approx 4 ft. Love how the resort has complimentary life vests and tubes for guests to use. Aunty's Beach House is a wonderful, safe place for kids (age 3-12) to enjoy. They have a daily open house from 8-10 am for all ages - which was great for my two year old. My 9 year old loved the video game/media room. The staff was also well versed with food allergies and seemed knowledgeable about epi pens. Front desk staff, pool staff, and restaurant staff are very friendly and polite. Truly appreciated one male staff member who was primarily stationed at the sting ray pool during our stay. He was very engaging and seemed to enjoy teaching my older boy about sting rays. Enjoyed the character breakfast (Goofy, Minnie, Mickey)- great entertainment for a two year old (Stitch is out and about the resort only at certain times). Chef actually met us and told us what was safe (essentially everything except pastries). I made online reservations for the Aulani restaurants (which were expensive but not outrageously so) and made note of my son's nut allergies. Every single waiter we met had already seen that we had a food allergy and made the appropriate accommodations. At Ama Ama, they even made a special loaf of taro bread which was wonderful. Aulani is very \"disneyesque\" where customer service and safety seem to be paramount. Unfortunately, we had two very negative experiences at Rainbow Reef and with the valet - hence the 4/5 rating instead of 5/5. At Rainbow Reef, the pool attendant didn't seem to care that my son's life vest wasn't properly fastened. I pointed this out to the male attendant, and he didn't do anything - not a thing. From outside the gate (while holding a squirmy 2 year old), I wound up having to scream at my husband and son to NOT enter the water until the vest was properly on. Furthermore, my son was snorkeling for the first time, and he wound up struggling with the equipment. This attendant was oblivious. I politely asked if he would give my son some advice, and he completely, rudely ignored me. For a company that prides itself on safety, I was appalled that this employee actually worked there. As for the second encounter - we called for valet service one afternoon. When we made it downstairs, we checked in with the female attendant at the valet podium. We then sat on a bench - in plain view of this attendant, and waited. We waited for over ten minutes. Finally, we went back to her, and she said, \"Oops. I couldn't find your name.\" So, instead of approaching us when she couldn't find our name, she chose to ignore us and hope that we would forget about needing a car. All in all, our Aulani experience was positive.

The property itself is beautiful. Very similar to the Grand Californian Hotel or Animal Kingdom Lodge except Hawaii-ized. Online check-in is a fun new service they are offering, which allowed us to pick up our keys outside of the hotel and head straight up to our rooms. The property itself is fantastic. The pools, waterslides, lazy river, beaches, activities and experiences are above and beyond even what you would expect from Disney. The hotel rooms are very nice. I was hoping for a separate tub and shower (pretty standard at resorts of this caliber in Hawaii), which you don't get at Disney, but beyond that the rooms are done very nicely. We had two major problems with the trip. The first was room service. For a five day stay, we were at the pool and beach every day from 9am-4pm. But our rooms only got cleaned once. This is shoddy by any hotel's standards. The second was food. We made some dinner reservations, expecting that it would be straightforward to get meals for breakfast and lunch somewhere on the property. It is not. The first morning we were there they were having a character breakfast at the buffet restaurant. These breakfasts take a relatively small number of people, which leaves everybody else in the hotel to either get room service (75 minute wait) or stand in a 20 minute line at the shoddy 'continental' breakfast next door where there is zero seating. The pool service was nice, but if you want something to eat right away for lunch, there is nowhere to get it, as the bars don't serve food and One Paddle, Two Paddle doesn't open until 5pm. All in all, we were extremely disappointed with the availability of food and the room service issues we experienced. Disney really needs to iron this out because it turns an otherwise awesome experience into a huge inconvenience when you're spending hours trying to find something to eat. We also had one of our dinner reservations screwed up by the resort. We made a reservation at Ama Ama only to find that they lost it and we were unable to eat there. Yay! Back to the rooms to order room service which takes 90 minutes to arrive. If Disney could repair this - maybe open One Paddle Two Paddle all day so there's always a quick counter service option - the resort would be infinitely better. My recommendation is to have a reservation for every single meal, with the possible exception of lunch where pool service works pretty well.

Clean, comfy and just down right awesome 3. Facilities - Pool area and beach were exceptional. 4. Entertainment - night time entertainment that even adults could enjoy 5. Daily activities - Disney puts out a daily activities sheet that allows you to choose from several fun and interesting things to do that don't cost you any extra and provide a break from the normal pool/beach routine (we went on a 45 minute walking tour to view the artistic and cultural detals that Disney incorporated into the Aulani...who knew?) The not so good.... 1. I would have to agree with others: Their food options are somewhat limited. I can''t imagine taking kids there. Where are the chicken fingers? Mac-n-cheese? Hey, kids are on vacationa and they don't really want to eat a \"buffet\". If Disney could do anything I would say to increase the food and beverage options as it would benefit both kids and adults. 2. Airport shuttle - You should figure this out. You are a distance from the airport as well as Waikiki and you do not provide any reasonable options except to rent a car and then let it sit there in the parking lot (of course you can use the car the head over to the Safeway, Pizza Hut, etc to bring food back for the family:-) and be charged $35 per day for the parking 3. Adult pool area - Disney claims in their materials that there is an adult pool area. In fact that is not true. They do a have a \"relaxation/leisure\" pool area but it does not prohibit families from bringing their kids. We ended up not hanging out at this pool which was fine, but in high season I could imagine you would need to get away and have the adult area availabe to you. As someone mentioned in their reviews, the pool areas were crowded and the hotel is only half open. Yikes, what happens when the fill all those rooms?

The last time i looked at my son who is in 5th grade he did not look like an adult. That was totally unacceptable. We sat at the bar next to the buffet and we were able to order appetizers. How nice after an 8 Hour flight. They have a Tween /Teen lounge that is completely a joke of a room and a experience. The space might be 800 square feet with nothing to do. Within the small confines is a nail salon and yogurt bar which now reduces the space to maybe 400 sf. There is a x box / 4-5 chairs and two computers. Come on Disney i know you can do better. At the beach we asked for a soccer ball which they had but told us that they were not allowed to hand over any balls to guests any longer as it was a liability issue. What a joke of a resort. The food at Aulani was a complete joke of an experience and i would not recommend this hotel to anybody traveling with children. The best experience was the ABC store across from the hotel along with the Just Taco's restaurant.

This resort allows anyone to come and dine, and if you are paying $650 a night for a room, this doesn't give you priority at all. We have 2 small kids and all we had to eat were french fries and chicken fingers for the majority of our stay. Reservations at the restaurants always had a 2 hour wait, and you couldn't even book ahead because they weren't accepting reservations. Luckily there was a take out stand, but they ended up running out of \"macaroni and cheese\" so you were left with burgers, chicken fingers and hot dogs. This stand did not have much of a menu either. There is nowhere to buy fresh fruit for the kids, you can't pick up a banana or apple anywhere and this resort is situated in a pretty remote area...there are some developments underway but for the most part you don't have many options.

Everyone had a smile and a kind comment or question about your day.

As you would expect the place is incredibly clean and tidy, with unused sunbeds tidied and towels removed every 30 minutes or so, in the usual Disney fashion workers moved around cleaning areas without you even really noticing. A great feature is the fact that the pools and slides are open really late, and life guards stay on duty. Many hotels in Hawaii close their pools and no lifeguards are working after 5pm.

However, after having 2 young kids we have changed our tune and love Disney properties and their care for families. This is what continues to draw us to Disney resorts. My inlaws own at the Marriott Beach Club which is a timeshare 3 coves down, and we have stayed at the Marriott Ihilani- the hotel next door, a few years ago. This Disney resort puts those in a lower class and makes thems seem dated, although they are beautiful properties. The architects and designers really did a fantastic job with the asthetics, really trying to keep Hawaiian culture in mind. There was so much to do and we stayed 7 nights, we didn't even leave the area and still could not take it all in. Of course, we are beach lovers with a 4 and 5 year old from a cold midwestern climate so we wanted our vitamin D fix. With 2 young kids we also didn't need to do the Northshore experience which is a whole day trip and a lot of time in the car. First the room, we had a king-sofabed with an oceanview on the 15th floor. Gorgeous and breath taking. The bathroom was well designed-cubbies to keep all your stuff off the surface, private room for the toilet, wonderful tub, luxurious robes for you to use, 2 different showerheads, a large rain type and a detachable sprayer which gave lots of pressure. The toilets had amazing flush power. The bed had storage for your luggage-super space design! Also made it easy to access your luggage. The fridge was tucked into the TV armoire which also made it asthetically pleasing. You could ask for a microwave but we found we didn't need it. Basic coffee pot and a bonus hot water pot! Excellent tea in a hideaway drawer. Again, made the room classy without clutter. Free wifi internet with excellent reception. 4-5 bars. A great lobby to sit in the mornings or another quiet time and enjoy the outside. Super water fun. A nice quiet beach cove, honestly, the hotel was full at one point and their was still plenty of room at the beach, and only one point in our stay did we have difficulty locating tubes for the lazy river or slides. The beach is the calmest of the 4 for kids, they built a man made surf break but it was still beautiful. Disney even put in a nice raft for kids to swim to and jump off. Water was a beautiful blue-green and you could see fish in it without snorkelling. We had no problems with reservations, if you are going to plan such a splendid stay, it pays to plan ahead so when you make your trip plans to go ahead and book your restaurants, you can always cancel. We found Disney reservations are booked everywhere you go. We did the character breakfast at which my daughter got sick and threw up all over, but Disney accommodated that mishap well. We also had the Mahiki dinner buffet which was also excellent, I think people who complain are wanting something to complain about. The food was hot, and also very good. We saved our budget by going to the ABC store, the Hawaiian b-que, and Mexican restaurant which was within walking distance for my 2 kids. We also bought the all you can drink mugs for 18.99. There is laundry on the first floor, 3 dollars a pop for the washer and the dryer, but it did the job well and the dryers worked in one cycle unlike other laundry facilities I have been to. Kids loved Aunty's Beach House, and there are great programs for the littles. Loved the rainbow reef, a concentrated area of the most colorful fish you would ever see snorkelling without the anxiety of current, other sea creatures for a fraidy cat like me. We about the all you can swim package, 39 for adults, 29 for keiki. otherwise it is 20 daily adults, 15 for kiddos. On a 7 night stay it made it well worth it. Very friendly and accommodating staff. At one point their dvd player froze up on our Cars2 dvd, warning, for some reason the LG model they have has frozen up on Cars2, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 and Transformers movie. They have been in contact with them regarding this issue. Minor issue which you would have at home if you have that LG blu-ray player. I loved it, my kids loved it, my husband who has stayed all over the world says this was the best hotel he has stayed at in terms of asthetics, quality, and service. Would come again in a heartbeat! oh yes, if you don't want to rent a shuttle we took a lovely ride from Hawaiian shuttle, super service, 50 dollars, he will even stop at Kapolei for an extra 10 dollars! You might want to contact me for the exact phone number. You can always rent a car for one day at the 2 car rental spots at the Ihilani or Disney. Just make your reservation early.

You're wondering \"Should I stay here?\" and \"Why is it so expensive compared to other similar properties?\" I'm gonna make similar comments to what I said after taking a Disney cruise a few years ago. I hated it. But gave it five out of five stars. Why? My family had a great time, but I'm definitely not a \"Disney Dad.\" If you've got kids, they've probably seen the ads on Disney channel and have been bugging you to stay here. Why else would you be traveling all that way to stay at a hotel where you know you're going to see kids everywhere? Property is excellent. Beach is perfect. Pools are wonderful and the lazy river is a delight. Toss in a couple of fun tube rides and a mini water park for the little ones and you've got a great experience. That said, it's an extremely pricey experience. We paid just over $1100 for two nights. That's a lot of money. Add to that parking ($35 a day, if I recall) and meals ($120 for a dinner buffet for a family of 3.) We found ourselves walking next door to the Marriott for breakfast where there were less expensive dining options (but still expensive.) There's a very small shopping area just across the street from the Aulani resort that features the ubiquitous ABC shops. Those stores provide everything a tourist would want. Think of it as an upscale 7-11 combined with a classy T-shirt/souvenir shop. Prices were exceedingly reasonable. I was able to pick up a bottle of beer for about $2.00 which would have cost at least $7.50 at Aulani. The rooms were excellent. The property was amazing, full of Disney surprises and detail. My kid loved the electronic scavenger hunt and did it several times over the 2 days we were there. We had a garden/mountain view room that also had a view of the ocean. I was also pleasantly surprised at how un-Disney the experience was. Yes, they had Disney characters out for photos. And yes they had ESPN and other Disney-owned networks on the TV. And yes they had Disney movies outside under the stars. But they didn't have Supercalifragelisticexpalidious playing in the hallways along with other Disney tunes, nor did they have every Disney souvenir for sale like they do in Orlando and Anaheim. This is a resort, not a theme park! I'm not a Disney fan but find it impossible to give these guys negative marks on anything, apart from the cost. One added bonus for Dads is that you'll see plenty of hot, young moms running around. We could only afford 2 nights there and did four nights at the Hilton Waikiki Village which was okay. Maybe next time we'll stay at the Marriott next door and do a few more nights at Aulini. My wife and 9-year-old loved the place and can't wait to return. We all had a great time making Disney hard to resist. One tip. If you're renting a car through Thrifty just make sure they don't ding you for a $12 additional driver charge for your spouse, a complete ripoff. They said they had to charge me that because I'd gotten such a great rate on the reservation. Just make sure you're not hit for an additional driver charge when you reserve your car ahead of time.

The property is large and the kids go nuts there, they love it. The pool area is a kids dream come true and my daughter said 'it was the best day of her life'.A little pool for snorkeling, you can sign up to feed the manta rays, great slides. Really, that is why we went. One of the greatest features and I tip my cap to the place: Pool Safety. OMG! There was a life guard every 6 feet along the the perimeter of the entire pool area ready to jump in. Which I saw them do for the slightest things. Outstanding!!!! The place was only half open, an entire tower of rooms were not open yet, and the place still felt way too crowded. There was an annoying need for reservations at their restaurants every night, you could NOT just walk in, hated that. the food was mediocre. But, I will say, we did the character breakfast and the buffet was a surprise. Nothing like the other resorts. It was HUGE and and very good. There are characters out all the time, and every night something to do like a 'luau' style show (big production), movie on the lawn by ocean (really nice), songs by camp fire. It really is so fabulous for kids. I did at times feel trapped in a manufactured polynesian ride, especially because they have this 'signature' song playing in their lobby CONSTANTLY (really beyond annoying by the third day, fifth you want to throw yourself over the lobby railing), but the lagoon and beach area with the gorgeous swaying palm trees helped save me. Look, it's Disney, but the kids love it and there really truly is a ton for them to do. The rooms were very brown and lacked brightness, but were clean and all had balcony's. Hint: go to the JW Marriot for breakfast buffet, killer! Especially when Aulani's room service time is an hour and a half, and the breakfast restaurant requires reservations months in advance: beyond belief.

The waterslide, lazy river and water parks are great for kids.

Ever get one of those \u201ccustomer satisfaction\u201d surveys? They always ask, \u201cDid we make you feel like a valued customer?\u201d And I find they seldom have. But not at Aulani. I was constantly greeted by name by Cast Members. If I mentioned to one my plans for the day, the next day they would ask me about it! Courtesy is only part of the story, though. Everybody goes the extra step to make your stay enjoyable and memorable. Now on to the amenities: My \u201cDeluxe Studio\u201d was on the small side, but big enough for two people. Pull out the sleeper sofa, and I\u2019m sure it would be tight. The bed was very comfortable, the pillows less so. It was also very quiet in the room, with excellent soundproofing. My only complaint about my stay would be that I had an \u201cIsland View\u201d room, but the view was of the hotel next door. The toilet is in its own room, so the sink and shower are not tied up. The shower had a \u201crain forest\u201d showerhead, hand-held nozzle, and bathtub. That area was quite spacious. Two plush bathrobes are in the room, as well as an iron, ironing board, hair dryer, and small safe. There is a mini-fridge with freezer section, two types of coffee pots, toaster, and because I had a DVC room, a large microwave oven. Wi-Fi is free. There is a 37 inch flat screen with several Aulani information channels. Disney has recently expanded the previously very limited number of channels they carry. There is also a DVD player, with a selection of discs available at the Community Hall. One bedrooms and larger have their own washer and dryer; studios must use the laundry on the first floor (also free to DVC owners). The resort itself is magnificent. Every day you can pick up a four page schedule of activities. Be sure to catch the Starlit Hui. The lazy river is a lot of fun, with surprises every time I went around. There are 3 hot tubs\u2014they count the infinity/bi-level as two, for their count of four. (Tip: if the whirlpool isn\u2019t active in the hot tub, look for a plastic cover over a timer knob. Turn on to activate whirlpool.) Try to set aside some time for the other activities, such as the cultural tours of the resort, or the make your own lei session. Also, Uncle\u2019s fire pit story telling is very entertaining. I know others have written that they\u2019ve found the resort crowded. On Saturday I went down early to \u201cgrab\u201d a lounge in the shade, with a view of both the pool and the beach. That entire block of lounges was mostly empty the whole day, with plenty of space elsewhere, too. Returning from sightseeing Sunday afternoon, I also had no trouble finding a lounge just where I wanted. This is the first time I have given 5 stars to a resort. I can\u2019t say enough good things about Aulani. From the design details connecting it to Hawaiian culture, to the activities, to the facility allowing you to stay after check out on your last day (locker room and showers, computer to print out boarding pass, etc.), to the friendliness of the Cast Members, my stay was a delight. I would be remiss in not mentioning some of the people who were so wonderful: Karli, Marcus, and Mikey at Community Hall, Uncle Aito, all the concierges, Hannah at towels and wristbands, Corey at the front desk, and Chrissy putting everything back in place.

The front desk doesn't appear to know the rooms very well yet as they seemed to be surprised it was only a 3 person room. The room was OK - a standard hotel room and bath - felt very much like a room at the Grand Californian with Hawaiian accents. In my opinion, it is overpriced - we paid over $500 for a non-ocean view. But then, there was the pool.... The pool area was great. Our kids loved the water slides (especially the tube slide), the lazy river and the kids play area. Dined at Ama Ama - food good, albeit again, pricey. Service still rough and very slow. Had lunch at the casual restaurant near the pool as Ama-Ama wouldn't take us as a walk-up for 45 minutes. I enjoyed my fish tacos, but my wife felt her meat was too dry. We had booked dinners a week ahead of time, but when booking, they were already limited in seating times. However, we noticed when we were there that neither restaurant was very full. Not sure why they are limiting bookings - but recommend booking as far in advance as possible - including lunch if you want a sit-down meal. If I could review the room and facilities separately, I would give the room an average (for the price), and the property as excellent. I only wish they had put in bunk bed rooms like they have at the Grand Californian - or that they had more King/Sofabed rooms (the front desk told us most of those were accessible rooms and they couldn't give them to us). We were very disappointed they couldn't provide us with our requested room type as we sleep terribly in a shared queen. Bottom line, we won't be returning to this hotel. We just weren't comfortable in the room, and I just can't see paying $1,200+ for two rooms or a suite.

We were a young couple travelling Oahu and at Aulani we met up with some family including parents, grandparents and young children. There is something for EVERYONE at this hotel.

There are lots of options for day tours, night shows, luaus etc... We rented a car for two separate days but didn't keep it overnight because parking is $35! However to get around the island to do some sightseeing you definitely need a car because there is next to nothing within walking distance and there is no public transit around. The biggest downside was definitely the food options. Hopefully Aulani improves this aspect of the hotel because most reviews comment on how disppointing the food is. The buffet at Makahiki wasn't very good and they seemed to keep running out of items so that you'd have to wait. It ended up being $42/pp. + tax + 18% automatic gratuity (even though all they serve you is drinks). The quick service meals were tasty but about $13 for a fairly small fish taco serving. We went to the market across from the hotel. It's a short walk but worth it. They have nice hot breakfast options as well as a whole grocery store with decent prices. We also ate at \"Just Tacos\" - the Mexican Restaurant across from Aulani and it was delicious! This hotel really provides an authentic Hawaiian experience. Receiving the lei and beaded necklace upon arrival made us so excited to start our stay at Aulani. The snorkelling was great! We saw some sea turtles which we didn't see at Hanauma Bay. A couple of our highlights were the 4 hot tubs which we hit up every night as well as Uncle's stories around the cozy fire pit - Enjoyable for adults and kids! The rooms are beautiful! We stayed in a parlour sweet and had a partial ocean view as well as a view of mountains and the golf course. The beds were very comfy EXCEPT for the PULL OUT COUCHES.

We have no complaints although based on most reviews, we did not eat at any of the restaurants. We bought supplies at the nearby Costco and Safeway and we also did take out from the ABC across the street. Their fresh salad bar was great. We tried to eat our main meals when we were away from the resort. The nearby town of Kapolei has all you need including Starbucks, Costco, Target, etc. We had some great inexpensive breakfasts at KOA Pancake restaurant in Kapolei. We drove to the North Shore twice and ate and shopped in Haliewa, a funky surfing town. We also drove to Honolulu twice and parked the car for free at Ala Moana shopping center. One day we did the Hole in the Wall Food Tour which was the best experience of our vacation. Back at Aulani, we avoided the family/kid events and mostly looked for quiet places to relax. That was available near the beach but not so much by the pools. My only suggestions to Disney would be better, less expensive food, an adult only pool area, and a better selection of souvenirs in the gift shop.

Very expensive, yet not worth the money. Food selection is very poor and not good at that! Kids meals are tiny!! We ordered a kids meal burger for our 9 year old son, it was one burger the size of a silver dollar! Seriously Disney! Shame on you! The rooms are average and no way near worth the money. We stayed in a waterfront room, and it was really a pretty distant view of the ocean, the rate was over $500/night and that was with a local resident discount! The beds were uncomfortable, but it was the pillows that were killer!! They were sooooo hard and soooo uncomfortable that we didn't get any sleep!!! The pool water was too cold, the pools to shallow, (not over 3 feet), hot tubs too cold, services was the worst we have ever had on the islands, very unknowledgeable and they were all like FBI agents watching and policing the use of the pools like little Hitlers, very unfriendly!!! Everything about this place was just so very average, and so very expensive for what you got, or should I say didn't get. I am not a cheap vacationer but this place was soooo not worth it!!! I don't mind spending a lot on vacations, but I expect it to be worth it and I expect good service! Save your money!!! This place was awful. What a HUGE disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We got there at 11:30pm, so we just headed to our room and went to bed. We did rent a car for the duration because I like to explore, but if you don't mind just enjoying a casual, enjoyable resort, you wouldn't need to rent a car. We did the shopping trip to Costco and Safeway and stocked up our kitchen. We did eat a few things on the resort at One Paddle, Two Paddle, but otherwise it was either made in our kitchen or went out somewhere. We did just about everything that was available for free at the resort. We did the movie's under the stars, the evening show, firepit story telling, lei making, plus so much more. A few things did get cancelled because of the rain (yes we got a good amount of rain), but who cares, you are on vacation. We loved the pools, hot tubs and I loved the water slide. The whole water slide was done in the dark so you didn't know when a turn was coming. The lazy river tube ride was just that... lazy. Just about every cast member was friendly and it felt like being on a cruise with everyone saying hello. The beach was fantastic and the location of the resort was great. My parents loved the fact that it was in a quiet area. They have been to Maui and love that atmosphere, so this was perfect for them. The resort isn't fully open yet, so I can't imagine how busy the place will be during peak season. I would never want to go to Hawaii anyway during the summer.

The hotel is a towering Polynesian themed Disney additon to Hawaii, without the theme park. Uniquely decorated with sweeping murals and large sculptural icons of Hawaii and Polynesia, the hotel lobby overlooks the restaurant below with a tropical forest canopy, a volcanic hilltop and a floating river circling around it all. A heavy wood staircase leads down to the restaurant and gardens, and the dining area has both inside and outdoor dining. A long buffet area with stations for ham and omelettes plus an extensive menu of pastries, eggs benedict, meats and seafood are featured. While we were dining, Minnie Mouse and Goofy were visiting guests for photo opportunities and a happy hula hostess was entertaining the kids with a parade, music and singing throughout. The facilities were spotless and the service impeccable with all needs attended to without request, a feature rarely seen in Waikiki today. Beverages were tended to, extras offered without asking. The fare: $32 for adults and $15 for kids. After breakfast is done, the family strolled through the gardens, with waterfalls, lilyponds, fish and covered seating areas. A walk along the floating river took us to the pool/recreation area which includes a private salt water pool stocked with 1400 native reef fish which guests of the hotel can snorkel in. There is a seated viewing area of the underwater reefs and fish which our grandkids enjoyed. Guests of the hotel can float lazily along the freshwater \"river\" in large inflatable tubes... The public beach can also be accessed nearby, although we did not go there, at no charge. It is a protected cove which was built for both public and hotel use. Restrooms were ample and clean; there are sundry shops upstairs near the porte cochere featuring Hawaiian made items and clothing. It was one of the aims of the Disney Corp. to keep the authenticity of Hawaii and Polynesia in every aspect of the hotel's decor and character.

While there are some limitations, we were very happy with the resort. We had rented a car and arrived around 5pm after a long flight and drive from the airport. We had our room keys before we even got into the building, and were unpacking our bags in less than 20 minutes after pulling into the resort. We had a 1BR Ocean View, and we were extremely pleased with the location, because we were able to also see the mountains from the other side of the verandah. The pool area looks huge from the room, but when you're in the middle of it, it's designed in such a way that you can only see a few dozen yards either way, so it feels more intimate. The store has a decent selection of souvenirs, but not much in the way of food. If you're staying in a Villa with the kitchen, just run across the street to the ABC store for groceries. The lobby and common areas are fantastic, well-designed, and easy to find your way around. The spaces in the garage are narrow, but you can make do if you're careful and don't get surrounded by selfish folks in giant SUVs. The beach area is fantastic, and the folks running the rental area are fun to talk to. Less than $20 for a beach umbrella for the whole day, and they set it up for you wherever you want it. One note, the ocean water in February is COLD. The one downside that we encountered is the food. While dinner at Ama Ama was fantastic, the selections for lunch are pretty limited. One Paddle Two Paddle only has about five entree selections, and those are repeated at Off The Hook. The buffet is expensive and time consuming. Not that I'm looking for fast food, but something a little more accessible (chicken fingers, chicken caesar salad, pizza, etc) would have been great to grab and go on the beach or at the pool.

Tip #1: Active Duty Military should ask about military discounts when they call to make a reservation. We were able to get a 25% discount off the room rate. We also got an upgrade from a standard room to a partial ocean view, which was nice, and unexpected. You'll need to show your military ID at check in. Tip #2 Go to the Starlit Hui!!! They had crafts for the kids (and adults) and hula lessons before the entertainment started. Everyone sat on big woven mats to enjoy the show. The Hawaiian music and dancing was absolutely fantastic! The female lead has an amazing voice. Even my husband, who doesn't like \"touristy stuff\" was into it. They let the kids bang coconut shells together during one song. Unfortunately, it was our first night there and my daughter was too tired to stay for the entire show. Several Disney staff members asked if everything was OK and were ready to help when we got up to leave. We didn't realize that this was the only Starlit Hui of the week (Monday night) and were disappointed when we returned the next night hoping to catch the whole performance. I agree with the other reviewers about the price (Wow, it's expensive!) and that's the only reason I gave Aulani four stars instead of five. We spent the rest of our vacation in Oahu at a more reasonably priced locale. But, figure that the price of the room includes the leis at check-in, all the free activities, entertainment and Auntie's Beach House. I also agree with other reviewers that... ...staff are very friendly, helpful, and welcoming, ...Disney themes are very understated, ...the beds are too high for kids. I also agree with others about the food. We had breakfast at Ama Ama, which was very good and offers a fabulous view, but totaled $60 for an omelette, Belgian waffle, Mickey pancake, and two coffees. Had lunch and dinner at One Paddle, Two Paddle and Off the Hook, respectively, (same menu both places). The fish tacos ($16) were good, Kalua pork sandwich ($15) OK and kid's burger ($6) not so great. Service was very slow both times, unlike the very good service we had at Ama Ama. We took the advice from other reviewers and had dinner across the street at a noodle place and lunch at the Island Country Market (ABC Store). The Country Market has lots of grocery items, including organic, a nice deli, and good selection of souvenirs and t-shirts. You can also stock your in-room fridge with beverages and snacks. We all loved the pools and lazy river and spent most of our time in the water. There are small waterslides for little ones at the Menehune Bridge and you can go down in pairs, unlike the waterslides in the pool. The infinity spas were a little cooler (more comfortable) than the other hot tubs that are hidden throughout the \"valley.\" The beach is protected, so it is perfect for swimming. We successfully tried paddle boarding ($32/hour) and they let your child sit on the front of the board (life jackets provided for everyone). There are big fish swimming near shore, which is pretty cool, too. We checked out Auntie's Beach House. I was told it was for kids, aged 3 - 12, but parents can accompany younger ones (this is not clear on their web site). Unfortunately, the outdoor play area with climbing structures was closed (it closed at 5 PM even though the sun doesn't set until 6:30) and the area for young kids was closed off for Keiki Hula, which they wouldn't let my daughter attend since she was not yet 3, when we visited. I went to the lei making class (free) and would have liked to do some of the other craft classes and attend the cultural lectures, but didn't have time. I also didn't get to visit the spa...

The views from the Lanai are amazing the Waikolohe Valley is filled with mature trees (many are native plants); bridges, adventure trails, themed water slides, floating canal, family fun pool and splash party zone on the menehune bridge, a 2,200 square foot interactive play zone with three slides. Perfect for those 48 and under inches. Do not miss the Starlit Hui, it's a casual gathering where you will be entertained with hula, live music and even a family dance party afterwards. Ready to enjoy an intimate Character breakfast? Yes, Mickey is there to greet you as you arrive, you are then let to your table for a delicious brunch. Mickey and Minnie will spend quality time at your table for great pictures, so bring your camera! During the week, you can gather for a special magic -- Join Uncle and his helpers in a sunset gathering where he will change Aulani's welcome of the night. An experience you will not forget. The Pau Hana Room features movie rentals, board games and the Aulani Video Booth. The Video booth was one of the many highlights of our trip. My sister-in-law and I sat down in the booth and created a silly video to send home to family and friends. Through the system there, you are prompted to record a greeting, talk about your favorite thinks and most memorable experiences during your stay. You will also come to the Pau Hana Room to make hawaiian crafts (lei making, bracelet making and more). A must do -- Sign up for the Makai Preserve. Enjoy encounters with Hawaiian stringrays in this conservation pool. You can even feed them. If you are new to snorkeling or your children are at the right age to start snorkeling. The Rainbow Reef is an incredible opportunity for your children to gain experience in a safe environment. Everyone will get up close to hawaiian tropical fish (Angel, Butterfly and Tangs). Enroll the little ones in Aunty's Beach House. Hours range each day, but typically from 9:00 a.m. to 11 p.m. Your children will be immersed in educational and fun projects, character appearances and shore style parties. We enjoyed the 2-tiered sunset pool. It was a great spot to enjoy an early morning treat or during sunset time. Enjoyed a 50 minute LomiLomi massage in Laniwai. The facilities are first rate and enjoyed the hypdrotheraly garden, reflexology path and rain showers. The rain showers operate via sensor -- so it would turn on automatically when you were standing in front of the rain shower. For my bucket list, I took surf lessons. It was great to learn how to stand up on the board and an incredible experience to have a nice wave bring us in. The cast members throughout the property were very attentive to our needs and were always making eye contact with a warm greeting or offering assistance.

My husband, daughter who is 4, and I like to take family vacations in the Winter to get some sun, spend time together as a family, relax, and go somewhere with child entertainment so she can can have a good time and my husband and I can also enjoy some adult time. Pros: The resort itself is very nice, its beautifully landscaped and decorated fully Hawaiian,which was nice. You actually would not know you are at a Disney hotel until you see the characters. The rooms are nice, but no microwave. The pools are nice and not too deep for children. There is a pool sort of tuck away called Wailana Pool. Its very nice and relaxing, my daughter and I spent most of our swim time there. Also all the pools are pretty well shaded.The characters come out for fun and games at the main pool, Waikolohe and Rainbow Reef which is the snorkeling area. Rainbow Reef is salt water and cold. Any age can snorkle, but it does cost extra money. My daughter is only four so she wouldn't do it. She didn't like the mask and thought the water was too cold. I only saw older kids maybe 7 plus snorkeling. I didn't have any problem getting a refund. The splash park area is nice and only for children. Adults are not allowed to go on the slides or mesh area. The characters come out several times a day at a designated area. You can take pictures with your own camera and there is always a staff member with a photopass. Characters you will see, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, Stitch, Chip, and Dale. Throughout the resort there are these statues called Menehune. I've heard there's around 300. We were only able to find about 70. It was fun though, my daughter loved searching for them. The spa was very nice. I'd say a must. Do not however, book on a weekend. I booked mine on a Monday and it was perfect, only a few other guests were there. I was told the weekend was super busy. The spa is big, but not big enough to hold more than 20 people comfortably. You can buy a day pass if it isn't busy otherwise you have to book a treatment. The massages are totally worth it. I had a 90 min Hawaiian massage and it was fantastic. The thermal pools, sauna, and steam rooms were also very nice. Once you are in the spa you can spend as much time there, but once you leave you cannot come back in without purchasing another treatment. The staff at the spa was great! The beach is very nice. Negs: This is the topper. When we arrived the Bell man was very helpful and welcoming. The registration staff was another story. We didn't have a problem getting our room, but we had a problem with our room. When we first got to our room around 11pm our room key worked. We then left to explore the hotel, upon return one key card worked out of three and then it stopped working. We called down for help and someone came, but almost 2 hours later he still wasn't done fixing it at this point it was almost 2am. They never offered to move us or even apologized. We also booked a garden view room which was more money and our view was of the entire parking lot again no apologies. They were terrible! Character Breakfast- I would skip it. The food is the same as the regular buffet, There are only 3 characters, I was very surprised by that because all character breakfast I've been to have at least 4 characters and the kids always get some type of prize. The food: It was good, but not not enough places to choose from or variety. They need A LOT more. One good thing is the staff will come up to you at your lounge chair and take your order so you can be as lazy as you want. If you are looking for a nice dinner at 'Ama 'Ama get there EARLY. We went for dinner after hours around 8:30pm and had a 20 min wait. They have a Hawaiian Shaved Ice station, but its not a real hawaiian shaved ice, no cream, I was SUPER sad about that. I spoke to the staff though and they did say they have been \"approved' for the cream so its coming. Apparently \"Disney\" people didn't think mainland people would want \"Hawaiian\" type of stuff. People are visiting Hawaii they should and probably want \"Hawaiian\" stuff. Same goes with the food, they don't really have Hawaiian food. BIG dissappointment- No Luau. They do have a night actually two with Luau type of entertainment, but no food. Now the Resort is not all inclusive so I expected to pay for the Luau with food and all, but it wasn't offered. Not enough entertainemnt at Auntie's Beach house. So the Children's Program is included in your hotel stay, but they only have 1 or 2 organized activities each day and usually 1 you have to pay for. Again I was expecting to pay for actvities, but barley any were offered. Only 3 paid activities and 3 nonpaid. We have been to Beaches resorts so maybe we've been spoiled, but their program is awesome. they have an activtity every hour. Since this is Disney, a place for children I assumed there would be a bunch of activities! Sadly, there was not. Maybe as the resort gets older they will start to add more. Activities repeated on the second day we were there. I do think this resort is very nice, but I cannot imagine being there when it is full. There just isn't enough lounge chairs, pool area, or restaurants. I would avoid peak times. I did hear they are thinking about building another restaurant and getting a shrimp truck. Not sure if that's just a rumor. So the resort is above average, but not very good. Just good. TripAdvisor needs a \"good\" star rating. Reviews I read complained a lot about the prices. I actually did not think they were that high. Hawaii is expensive that's just that and its a Disney Hotel so its what I expected. There's a super market across the street so you can always go there to buy snacks, but the price isn't that different than the hotel's prices. However, the local store does have a lot more to choose from. Also across the street is a GREAT ice cream shop do stop by! Finally, the hotel should offer a shuttle. I think its only right. You are paying a lot for the stay and the hotel is a bit far from the airport so a shuttle would be a nice accommodation.

We didn't feel comfortable buying into this DVC resort site unseen. We are a family of three - child of three years. So in Jan 2012 we made a trip to Oahu to check out the resort - went for several hours on two different days and tried two restaurants: Ambiance - fun, family, saw several Disney characters, not too busy and quiet areas if you wanted. Beautiful spa. Very nice fitness room - no windows in fitness room which was a little disappointing. Rooms - we visited all the DVC rooms not hotel rooms. Studio had Good size mini fridge, microwave...enough to get buy on but not a full kitchen. Full kitchen and washer/dryer in one, two and three bedroom villas. The three bedroom villa is spectacular!!! The balcony runs the whole length of the unit so every room and living room has access to the balcony - all with ocean views. So if you want to really cook, you need a one bedroom minimum. They have dedicated two bedrooms or lock-off two bedrooms (ie has two entrances). Recreation - lazy river, pool, snorkel pool, lagoon - lots to do. Only real complaint - you have to wear a life vest while snorkeling in their snorkel pool. As a diver and avid snorkeler, I find this ridiculous especially since you do not have to wear a vest in the lagoon which is much more dangerous. I know - liability... Sign a waiver, I say. They have ample life guards on staff - it seems like they are at every corner of every pool. No surfable waves in this specific area - have to drive to another beach for that. Food - Ama Ama, their high end restaurant, was terrible. We had lunch there. The ravioli was cold - sent it back. It came back luke warm on a hot plate??? The steak was the WORST piece of meat I ever had in my life - and I have had a lot of steaks all over the world. We were plain hungry so we ate it. The service was really slow. The view was obstructed by screens that hung down. The place was nearly empty but tables hadn't been cleared off. Not what I expect of Disney. We returned for a second look and ate at the poolside bar - awesome fish tacos! Dirty cushions though. I'd be careful of what you order! It's really hit or miss. I don't mind paying for food as long as it is good. Location - 30 min from airport. It's out in a gated resort area - no real shopping in the resort district other than hotel stores/restaurants. Outlet mall just 15 min away but much better shopping at Ala Moana mall if you want great selection. It's the largest outdoor mall in the world with 390 stores. Golf course right across the street from resort. Aunty's beach house - drop off your kids while you go to spa, golf, nice evening.... The one thing Disney has always done well - looking after the little ones. For that you can't beat Disney! Toddler size sinks, kids activities, photo ops with favorite characters... Recommendations - rent a car and shop at Costco unless you want to eat at the resort all day. The Costco is 5 min from the airport in the other direction (toward Waikiki). Well worth it. We went to costco twice during our two week stay in Waikiki. We did buy into the resort in the end because it's a good fit for our family. But we will likely spend a week in Waikiki as well. Being able to walk out onto Waikiki, grab a bite, people watch, shop till you drop, surf...all at your fingertips is pretty great.

We couldnt be more pleased with this Resort. We went as two adults (no kids this time - but cannot wait to take them next time!!) and we had a blast. We did our due-dilligence before we left and took the best advice from others before going and had no issues while we were there. Here is a summary of things you must know/do to avoid any surprises: 1. Realize that this is NOT an all inclusive resort so don't go expecting everything to be FREE/included or some-how cheap just because you spent $400 a night to go. The food was fine and the drinks were GREAT! Their menu choices were limited but it was fine considering we left the hotel to eat true local cuisine on several occasions.. which leads me to #2... 2. Rent a Car - we rented a vehicle for 5 days for less than $200 and made many trips away from the Hotel to eat authentic Hawaiin cuisine at half the price of the resort food. (you'll pay $110 for a round trip taxi to/from the airport anyways so do youself a favor and just drive yourself) - and p.s. we didnt pay any parking fee bc we were DVC which was great!! 3. Pack extra showering toiletries if your DVC and they arent serviceing your room (as is standard for a DVC stay). This will keep you supplied between stock ups. 4. Go to the SPA! Its AMAZING and relaxing and quiet and perfect... best money spent all trip!! We didnt feel that the resort was crowded at all (there is still a tower of rooms empty at this point however) - we always found open chairs to lounge in and the staff were always kind and accomidating. Even with kids around we didnt feel like it we couldnt relax because they were too distracting or noisy... its a FAMILY resort - we expected families. The resort is about 15 min away from a bunch of outlets for those who like to shop. And if you want another fine dining choice that you dont have to drive to, Roy's is right across the street and offers a great dining experience. The thing about Aulani is the detail - every little thing was meticulously designed to make you feel immersed in Hawaii without it being cheesy or too disney. They hit a home run!

I have no criticism. Yes, they need more food options but if you have a car, you can go anywhere for food. The Country Market is across the street and walkable. You can order a variety of hot foods there grilled to order inlcuding omelettes in the morning. I had a a cheeseburger with fries for $7.99 and it was delicious. I will not list all the things to do because so many others have done that. There is so much to do in or out of the water. Talk to the staff.

One thing about Disney properties that you can count on is a standard of high quality and attention to details, and Aulani does not disappoint. Rooms were lovely, well stocked, convenient and quiet. An ocean-view room really does give you a full ocean view( as opposed to others we've had in HI where, if you twist your neck around the side of a balcony, you can catch a glimpse of blue.) While we were there during a \"slow\" time in Jan., there was always room at the beach and never had a problem finding chairs at the pool either. LOVED the lazy river and water slides. Too much fun for even us old folks! Didn't use the pool areas (why sit by the pool when you have a lovely, quiet beach on a lagoon?) but do agree with other reviewers that an adults only pool area and hot tub would be great. Meals prices at Aulani are much too high. We only ate at AmaAma for a beautiful sunset special dinner with terrific food, but their other restaurants are crazy even for HI standards. Seriously $9 for a Kona coffee? Luckily there's a Costco, Target, Outback and more just three miles down the road. Since the rooms are suites with microwaves, refrigerators, coffee pots, etc, you can buy everything you need for eating in, or have lots of restaurant choices to eat out. I do think Disney is losing a lot of $ by having such high meal prices, and from the amount of food being carried in, others must agree. Staff was very helpful and friendly, concierges were informative and art work and surroundings are beautiful. We felt that the \"Mickey\" influence was very discrete. Characters were available for photos during the buffet and there was a subtle wood toned Mickey lamp in the room, but the decor is definitely Hawaiian art and culture rather than Disney.

But for other adults you can find better places to stay and really enjoy Hawaii. Many who love Disney are probably giving higher ratings out of habit because you are use to the other Disney properties and the cruise ships. To me it appeared that they tried to cram something into every inch of the pool area resulting in a less than relaxing time for adults. There were four hot tubs but none were adult only and were full of unsupervised small children even though the sign states that adults were required for those under 12. There is a quiet pool but it is not adult only. Disney does not police the hot tub policy even when you complain. The hot tubs are also luke warm - they don't want to harm any of the one or two year old children that parents foolishly take into the hot tubs. I did love the lazy river feature because it was relaxing and hid the crowded chair areas. Disney needs an adult only area just like the cruise ships for those of us who love Disney but occasionally like to get away from the children for a few hours. We will go back if we have grandchildren. Other comments about the lack of restaurants is true. Fortunately we had a car and explored much of the island. I highly recommend the Marriott vacation club Longboard restaurant on the walkway by the beach for it's sunset dinners and entertainment. Prices were reasonable for Hawaii and half the price of Disney. The hotel was very beautiful and staff very attentive.

The hotel and rooms are immaculate. We ate at Ama Ama for breakfast(corned beef hash is great) and dinner(make a reservation for sunset and it will be a highlight of your stay.) Both meals were very good and worth the price. We had the fish tacos, pulled BBQ and lettuce wraps throughout our stay for lunch at the outside bar which were all delicious. For some cheaper meals head over to the ABC where they have wraps and sandwhiches that are good and reasonably priced( also pick up some liquor to cut down on the bar bill( Try the local Kona longboard beer which I thought was great) Other restaurants: We ate at Chuck's which was very good, Azul at the Marriot was OK( I would try another Italian place when we go back as the menu was very limited) Just Taco's accross the street of hotel (decent Mexican but they charge you for the chips so if you don't want them don't take them). We ate Ola at Turtle Bay resort at the North shore and had some good burgers and garlic fries and at Romy's shrimp shack at the north share which the concierge tolds us about and were happy with the quality of the shrimp. We had room service 1 night which is my only negative ( don't get the pizza as its really really bad) Excursion: We did the Adventure by Disney Cataraman.

The lounge has secure lockers, impressive showers, and a TV lounge area, allowing you to freshen up before your flight. You can even print your boarding pass! Aunties Beach House is worth the cost of the accommodation by itself. Our 3 children (10,8,6) wanted to stay at Aunties most of the day, and the House itself has to be seen to be believed. It must be one of the most well thought out and secure children's facilities I have seen. The children are issued with a locator bracelet which allows the staff to know exactly where they are in the house at all times. They need to be scanned in and out each time and you need to provide a special password on the first day which you will use each time to be able to take them out. Even the resort itself reeks of safety everywhere. It is one of the first times I have ever been happy to let my 6 year old boy go swimming and play by himself. There are lifegurds everywhere, and there even seems to be cleaners and other staff that appear from nowhere to deal with problems. The waterslides were a lot of fun for all of our family and maintained interest for a whole week. The lines varied. There was an occasional wait, but most of the time during our trip it was a handful of people at the most. There is just so much to do that a week was not long enough for us. Some of the things we enjoyed; 1) rainbow reef exp-erience, swimming with the fish at feeding time was fantastic. The water was suprisingly cold but you get used to it. 2) not having to carry money around. Charging things to our room key, even a shaved ice, was so convenient. 3) we had a DVC room so had a kitchen, with full sized fridge. It made breakfast easy and we often made sandwiches for lunch, which allowed us to eat out for dinner. I think the criticism of the food is partly justified, in that they could definitely use a basic diner of some sort, especially for families. But if you come prepared, and utilise the ABC store's deli across the road it doesnt have to be extravagant. 4) regarding it getting too crowded when they open phase 3, I am sure it will get a lot busier. But we were there on Pro Bowl weekend and the resort did get inundated as a result of families of players and spectators staying and visiting from the Marriott(apparently they book the Marriott out). 5) they are almost non-smoking, with smokers restricted to 2 small areas.

The room was on the smaller side, but who stays in their room when at aulani? we loved the balcony and used it in the mornings, and loved the bathroom which felt luxurious. the beds were extremely comfortable. The entire place is just beautiful and smelled so good as well, especially by the elevators. the pool area and lagoons were not overly busy and were not overcrowded and we could always find a pool or beachside chair. we had a nice surprise to see the nfl pro bowl players on the grounds during our stay. we thought the water in the pools was nice and warm and and although the hot tubs did not have jets, (at least the ones we were in) they were still nice to sit in. we noticed the quiet pool closer to the spa area was always empty. not sure why. I loved auntys beach house. i could have moved right in it was so cozy and awesome. my daughter also tried the menehune adventure trail, and although we only had time to do half of it, it was alot of fun seeing the surprises and cook things that happened. i wished it went a little quicker though. too much talking. i should not judge by the bad reviews, bit because of them, we did not eat at any of the restaurants. we didnt want to spend that much money on food anyway. we did try one paddle two paddle however and thought the burgers were really good and we ate there at least 3 times. it was 14 dollars for a large burger and a healthy portion of fries. my husband tried the pork sandwich one night and did not care for it and i tried the lettuce wraps and did not care for that either and could not even figure out how i was supposed to eat it as it was so messy. the kids meals were a good value for 6.95. ours had the cheeseburgers and they got 2 mini cheeseburgers and fruit, veggies or fries and a beverage even though the fries and beverage are not listed on the menu as included for them. we went across the street to the restaurants and abc store. Even though rainbow reef was a little chilly, the family loved it alot. the fish would swim right up to you and you could feel them on your body and feet. we got a lot of good video here. there was an employee there named Terry that was super super nice and helpful. an awesome employee like that helps make your stay memorable. i scheduled a lomilomi signature massage and it was wonderful. i have never had 80 minutes go by so fast in my life. the spa is absolutely amazing. when you come in, you choose a stone with a word on it, and that is your word of the day. then you return it in this really cook area. they have the hydrotherapy pools in the back outside with the different showers and whirlpool. you get to choose a scent for your custom body scrub which you can take home with you. the spa has a scented steam room, sauna, relaxation rooms etc where they serve you tea, offer you muffins and chocolate covered blueberries and organic gummy worms and give you the most luxurious robes to wear. you are free to use the facilities all day, but once you leave, you cant return. after you are done and ready to leave, they have amazing showers with the best smelling shampoo, a beautiful sink and vanity area where they have everything you can think of..razors, hair dryers, cotton swabs, feminine products, sunscreen, and even mouthwash. when you leave, they give you bath salts in the scent you had chosen for your massage or body scrub and with the word on the rock you had chosen. with tax and gratuity included in the total bill, it came to around $270 which is quite alot, and probably worth it if you can stay a long time in the spa areas, for me, i felt kind of guitly leaving, having spent that kind of money. it was worth it for a once in a lifetime experience to say i had a hawaiian massage at Aulani. They also have a massage you can choose where you get a body scrub first and then a massage under rainwater which sounded kind of neat. all in all, we would go back to Aulani. i doubt we ever will, but given the chance we would. it is absolutely beautiful, all the workers we encountered were friendly, and if you dont like the food you can just go across the street, or go 2 miles in kapolei and eat at mcdonalds or kfc. I dont understand about people complaining there is nothing to do. there is more to do there than there is at any regular hotel. if you want to go shopping then stay at waikiki. you have the beaches, the walk around the 4 lagoons and hotels, the activities in the daily iwa, a spa, aunties beach house for the kids, uncles storytelling,the menehune adventure trail, restaurants at aulani and the other hotels, next door they have the shark pool and neat grounds to tour etc.. the only thing i didnt like about hawaii was the early sunsets. i live where there is four seasons and when the weather is warm, it stays light out until 9-10 at night, so darkness at 6:15 was strange for us, and its like everything just shut down at sunset, there were hardly any people around, so made the days short. the main pools and jacuzzies are open until 10 however, but not many people used them. we liked to sit by the pool at night with a beer ($6.00)and margarita ($8.50.) shave ice was $3.75. They have some things you can buy in the lava shack that you can put your room cards and other things in and wear around your neck so you can go in the pools without leaving your stuff on chairs. beautiful place. awesome and memorable stay. hopefully in the future they will get the food issues fixed and people will be happy in that aspect.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas cIty", "Title": "\u201cWonderful, Beauitiful but seriously lacking\u201d", "Author": "Larry R", "ReviewID": "UR123794880", "Content": "Just returned from 8 days at the Auilani Disney resort in Ko Olina, Hawaii. The resort itself is amazing and beautiful with all of the outdooramenities necessary for any family to have a great time. The big problem comes with the, as usual, lack of Disney planning when it somes to casual dining. There is no one place to go to eat Breakfast, lunch and dinner without it being an expensive extravaganza. My biggest complaint is with breakfast where, except for room service with charges, ther is no place to eat a full breakfast for less than $27/person. We me to be forced to drive my family to Dennys and the next doot Marriott every day for breakfast is simply not acceptible. And yet you also find this same situation at other Disney resorts like the Animal Kingdom Lodge in Orlando. I admit that all dining in Hawaii is quite a but more expensive than the mainland, but a $100 breakfast every day is ridiculous. Continental breakfast is available, but only offering a greasy breakfast samdwich as anything close to full breakfast.My other issue is not the fault of Disney, but Ko Olina needs more restaurants to support the amount of guests beginning to come into the resort. They have little to no casual dinig alternatives except for glorifies fast dinig establishments and to travel into Waikiki is anightmare with traffic. Once again, this is not to say that we didn't enjoy most of our stay at Aulani, but it is to say that assukming your guests are all extravagantly wealthy is a serious mistake.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Gatos, CA - Northern California - Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cAwesome! Great for children! Excellent location on the beach\u201d", "Author": "afgam", "ReviewID": "UR123677119", "Content": "For those who are wondering what to expect, here's a very detailed review of the resort. Dates: January 1st to 6th Reception: What a reception! There were so many people welcoming us with Leis, fresh cold water with a slice of lemon and oranges. Then, we were escorted by To'oloni, a Disney Aulani employee who explained to us the entrance, the lobby, and the view, etc. Wow! Then, he escorted us to the front desk. Bell service: Always available. A Disney Aulani employee was there to help us with our luggage. Since they were so busy, we did not get our luggage until 4 p.m. Checking in: It was simple. The experience was so relaxing! Front Desk staff: All nice personnel and would go out of their way to answer the questions. Layout of the Lobby: Wow! We loved the story behind the lobby, the openness of the lobby, and simpleness of the resort. Elevators: Be careful! They are so quick to close. I thought it was the other guests closing the elevator doors by pressing the close button. However, after two days, just remember to hold the elevator door for others especially your family and friend members. Windows on each hallway floor: so nice to see the pool and ocean. Room: We had the fortunate luck to have an ocean view. It was so nice to wake up every morning to the beautiful calming ocean. Our room had two queen beds and there was a spot underneath the foot of the bed to store your luggage. What a nice feature! There's a flat screen TV, mini fridge, and a hot pot (be careful with little ones). Bathroom: It was huge! The shower head was located on the ceiling and then there's an option to take a shower with the mobile shower handle. Basically, two shower heads at the same time. The tub is huge. You can take a nice long hot bath. We had two cotton robes, but only used it once. There's so many towels. Lots of storage, but look very carefully in the cubbies when you check-out. They are deep. I would recommend getting a collapsible plastic bench for the little ones to wash their hands, because the sink was high. The toilet is in a separate little room. The lighting was a little weak, but it was ok. There's a makeup mirror and a hair-dryer. The floor is granite so it can be slippery when walking around wet from the pool to rinse off. Oh! I forgot to mention that the lip of the bathtub is high. So, I recommend to watch your little ones when they try to enter and exit the tub. Lights in the room: minimal... I think it is suppose to be set a relaxing atmosphere. Balcony: Love the balcony... we used it once in the morning and at night. Two seats and a little table. Outlets: lots of them to charge any electronic device. Closet: Has lots of hangars, robe, iron, ironing board, safe. Neat feature: when you open the door, a light comes on. Microwave: I found out that you can request one for your room when you check in. Unfortunately, I found out half way through our vacation. Too late for us! Pools: Wow! We lived in every pool and lazy river experience. Chairs: Not enough... there are some poolchair horders. They will appear at 8 a.m. and lay out one article on more than 5 or 6 chairs - Then, no-one uses them for hours. I finally asked a Disney employee to help eliminate the poolchair horders. They were happy to enforce this. Stores: There's a mug to purchase that allowed endless fountain drinks, coffee, and tea. Activities: The menehune trail was great! I really recommend the Aunty's beach house for little ones who like arts and crafts. Restaurants: We really liked the sit down restaurant not the buffet. Many people complained that it was too expensive, but it was comparable to what we have dinner at our local bar & grill. It was actually cheaper. We had a great service from both our servers in the restaurant. We liked the food and enjoyed the uniqueness especially the dessert. We were there to enjoy the food and company. Beach front property: A must for the entire family even the boot camp available beginning at 7 a.m. Rent a cabana for half a day, made it nice for us to have shade and watch the children. Overall, we will be back again!

It was one of the best experiences we have ever had. We had never been to hawaii and wanted somewhere where our 8 yr old son woul dhave things to do as well. Disney's Aulani fit the bill to a tee. We actually got a good rate, under $300/night for a non ocean view room. Who cares if we dont wake up with the ocean, we were there everyday anyway. We ate at the buffet restaurant 2xs, once Xmas day morning and once for Dinner. Breakfast was a def a better experience. This is one area where Disney needs to step up their game. The food as a whole was tatsy and varied but was not presented in a nice way and cooking and food area upkeep staff seemed lacking both times. Wait staff was wonderful and the character breakfast Christmas morning was enjoyed by all the children and most adults. Our last night we ate at Ama Ama and it wqas wonderful! The service, view, food, all top notch. During our stay we ate at the quick serve bare areas or went across the street to the ABC store and bought some quick serve items. I can see where some may think the food prices on property were high but coming from the NYC area, the prices were reasonable for the food quality and service. Drinks prices were also fairly good! The resort is spotless and staff very friendly; a Disney Hallmark. we encountered two minor snafus during our stay, one accounting in nature and one staff related but all were dealt with quickly and efficiently. Aunites Beach House was a blessing. My son wanted to go every night and the staff seemed very caring and knowledgeable. Our evenings were free to enjoy ourselves knowing our son was well taken care of, and its free! you must pay a small fee for any meal he may receive but thats expected. The beach and water oin ou cove was clean, renting a beach cabana easy and price worthy although do it early, they do go quickly. The family did a catamaran tour thru the resort on Xmas day that was wonderful and my wife and I enjoyed the spa while our son was at Aunty's. definitely recommended! Getting to the resort from Honolulu airpoirt is a snap. we rented a car and drove into Honolulu one day and up the North Shore. Both fairly easy to navigate to/from the resort which provides good driection cards if you dont have a GPS. There is a large Target and Safeway 15 minutes down the road and the aforementioned ABS store across the street along with some quick serve restaurant as well. We looked at many other Hawaiian options but none were as kid-friendly as the Aulani. from what I heard its cxome very far since its opening in Sept/2011 and may still need a little more time to work out all the kinks but our experience was wonderful and we would def go again and again.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cAulani\u201d", "Author": "Gerry H", "ReviewID": "UR123626443", "Content": "Guests are given a flower lei upon arrival.

We stayed for a week at Aulani and had a great time. Quite, calm beach and lagoon. Lots of activities on the resort are offered, some included and some for extra cost. You can definitely keep busy all day just doing resort activities. Our kids LOVED the pool, water slides, and lazy river. There is a tour desk to book extra offsite activities and a great lounge and locker room to stay if you have a late flight home (ours left at 2330). Aunty's Beach House is a great way to entertain the kids and is included in the cost. My only negative comments are the beach/pool chairs and the food. We were told that 1 whole tower was not open yet and we still had a hard time finding chairs by the pool during the day. Part of that problem was people placing towels on 3 or 4 chairs and never actually using them so they sat empty for hours untill a cast member finally removed the towels. We are a family of 5 and we definitely don't use/need 5 chairs, 2 maybe 3 is more than enough. As for the food it was waay over priced and the Makahiki buffet did seem more Japanese inspired. Not much selection for the kids (pizza, pasta, hamburgers basically). The service at One Paddle, Two Paddle was horribly slow and they didn't get the order right 2 out of 3 times we got food from there. AMA AMA was the best but it was expensive. As for location, I can see/guess that Ko Olina will grow into a nice resort area with restaurants and shops in the future but right now there isn't much within walking distance.

We live in HI and decided to do a 1 day Staycation here. We had walked around the property when it had just opened months ago and thought: this is nice. However, when Tutu said, \"Let's stay over night\" last week, we jumped at the chance. A day trip does not do this place justice. There are so many layers of details at every turn. The lazy river was my favorite, since they didn't allow adults on the water jungle gym (currently have a letter to Disney to fix this issue). The pool water always seemed warm to us. The lazy river reminded me of Animal Kingdom (my favorite park). There were images of animals in the stones, volcano noises, smoke, rumbling bubbles and water slides. The Aunties House is huge and free. The pau hana room is genius for guests waiting to leave for the airport. We were locals, didn't have a plane to catch but hung out anyway. Enjoyed the scavenger hunt - Disney kicks it up a notch on these. Staff was very nice. Wasn't a fan of the high beds and Tutu had trouble with the deep tubs. Agree with the food issues. Suggest bringing healthy snacks and possibly going out to eat. We had no choice but to do take away for dinner and it was kinda ick. Breakfast was room service: good and hot but average portions and high fat/sugar. Lunch took 40 minutes at the pool eatery, the kalua pork came on a fried bun, with french dressing, no cabbage- never again. The hotel needs a quick, take away, food station with healthy choices by the pools and movie area. But otherwise, we will be back to stay and play.

My husband and I came to Oahu 8 years ago and I thought this would be our last trip. But now we can't wait to go back to enjoy the resort. Here are some thoughts: The only downside was that the oceanview was on the side and not overlooking the pool. We saw lots of ocean, but also the Marriott's parking garage and traffic below. It was a nice view, but I wouldn't spend the points on it again in the future. I did ask at the front desk and they offered to move us in 2 days (no rooms available on the weekend), but we didn't want to unpack twice. There is a great kids club that is free (shocking!). This is a fabulous option for parents who'd like a couple of date nights. We took advantage of the kitchen and ate most dinners in the room, or ate before we came back from sightseeing. I know the restaurants are pricey, but it didn't seem out of line with other resorts. The fish tacos from the fast food restaurant were delicious! Also, Papa John's and Pizza Hut deliver to the resort. The front desk will give you their numbers. I liked the resort location better than Waikiki because the beach area was so much nicer and more laid back. But it would've been nice to have the shopping and dining options in Waikiki too. For our next trip, we'll do 2 or 3 nights on Waikiki and then stay at Aulani for the remainder. If you plan on lots of sightseeing, get the \"Go Oahu\" card. It's $135 on Costco's website and it's a great deal (I think you can purchase even if you're not a Costco member). My son loved Wet N Wild (although it probably wouldn't have been worth the $45 admission). We all really liked the Movie Sites tour at Kualoa Ranch, hiking at Waimea Valley (bring swimsuits to swim near the waterfall), and touring the USS Missouri and Bowfin. Go to the swap meet at Aloha Stadium for your souvenir purchases. It's on Sat, Sun, & Weds. Plan on 2 to 3 hours. Bring a water because they had very limited beverages for sale. My husband enjoys getting massages but balked at the price here. He went and said it was totally worth the splurge. We also splurged on a cabana for our checkout day, since we had an evening flight. Again, totally worth it. We ate a couple dinners in to help justify the cost. Book early and request cabana #1 - it has a beautiful ocean view. The resort is definitely more crowded on Sat & Sun due to a lot of locals staying there. Also, traffice into Honolulu is much lighter on the weekend. So I'd plan resort days for weekdays and go into the city on the weekend. This is a great resort for couples.

We rented paddle baords on several days and by the end of our trip our kids mastered the art of Paddle Boarding.

The slide was fun & lifeguards attentive although zero instructions on how to go down slide (like crossing ankles, arms, etc.). Clean grounds & pools. The ocean is steps away but too close to neighboring Marriott. Nightly large-screened movies or live shows are ok.

Upon arrival we rented a vehicle from Enterprise, something I highly recommend, so you have the ability to really explore the island of Oahu. Honolulu, to my surprise, is much like any other metro city, so i was enjoyed the drive out to Ko'Olina, a more secluded part of the island. Our group consisting of all adults, my partner and I, his mother, and a friend were greeted warmly at the door by Lori, who introduced us to the resort telling us about the art in lobby and the features of Aulani. Check was quick and the resort had made note of our birthdays, they gave us birthday buttons, and pics from Mickey also wishing us both a happy birthday, that was a nice touch. Were DVC members staying in the nine person villa's, the room came equipped with a full kitchen, living room, washer dryer, there bathrooms, two queen beds in one room, and a king size bed in the master bedroom. Two of the bathrooms had rain style shower heads and the master bath had its own whirl pool tub. Also, because we're DVC members you do not get daily room service, something we are aware of when we purchased, but the room came well equipped with loads of towels that we managed with for six nights and seven days. We did do laundry to maximize our luggage space and cleaned up after ourselves as we would normally do at home. The resort did provide us with one box of dishwasher soap and laundry soap, but thats it, so you may want to bring your own. We ate in a lot and it saved a lot of money because, not only are the restaurants at Aulani pricey, so is all of Hawaii, so get used to spending money on food. The grounds of the Aulani are spectacular, I could spend years being lazy in the lazy river. The slide is awesome and I recommend more adults to give in to their child side and start using it! Especially the double person tubes, put two adults in that and you'll be sliding faster then a greased pig on slip and slide! The pool was shallow at only four feet, but its nice and warm and don't forget if you want something deeper they have a little thing called the ocean only a few feet away. Speaking of which, the ocean is only feet away and a great lagoon to relax in. The water is warm enough and there's plenty of chairs, between Aulani and the neighboring Marriott hotel. We had a ton of excursions planned so everyday we either came back to the hotel exhausted or jumped in the lazy river or the ocean, especially at night you get it all to yourself! One thing I wish we started sooner was the scavenger hunt, its much more involved and the system is slow, so better to start it sooner rather then later, you can always come back to where you left off. Overall, Aulani was a great mix of Hawaiian culture and entertainment, I went knowing I wasn't going to a theme park, but a resort, so our group planned excursions and trips to Honolulu, the Dole plantation, swimming with dolphins, Germaine's Luau, parasailing, whale watching, Waimea Valley, and a helicopter ride, so we kept fairly busy.

They are huge Disney fans and wanted to go badly. We've been to several Disney resorts in the past and always had great experiences there. The place is beautiful and there are tons of great activities for families. We received a warm welcome and was impressed with the entrance to the resort. We had a so-so meal at the Makahiki Buffet and really enjoyed watching a movie under the stars at night. Disney even handed out mats to sit on (a really nice touch). The character breakfast in the morning was better and the kids loved seeing the characters. But a disturbing thing happened our second day. My 7 year old daughter was going down one of the tube watersides and got stuck on the slide. Disney has sensors in place that tell the life guards when they can send down another rider. Either they didn't follow protocol (they say they did) or the sensors were broken ... but a few minutes later my daughter and a 300 lb man were tumbling down the slide together. They slammed into the water. I went in to get her. We made it to the side of the pool where she was throwing up water and hysterical. Her hands and legs were skinned up, but after checking her out, she was fine. It took several minutes for a lifeguard to actually walk over and ask if she was OK. They got a supervisor and he came and just said he didn't understand how that happened but he would check with the life guard on duty at the top and would get back to me. I didn't hear back while, in the meantime they kept running the slide with lots of kids on it. I finally went to the manager several hours later to get an explanation, and the manager said they'd check into it. Finally I got a call from the supervisor who told me the life guard followed protocol and that they were having issues with the sensors and it was malfunctioning. However, they kept running the slides without any warnings. The supervisor said a manager would call us later to see what Disney could do to make a our stay better and offered us a free shaved ice. Meanwhile my daughter was traumatized and just kept saying she wanted to go home. After staying several hours trying to convince her to go back in, we packed up and left. I never got the call from the manager and the only thing my two daughters really can talk about is the dangerous slide. I've got to say I was shocked at the lack of safety/communication/concern that Disney showed. She could've been seriously injured and was seriously traumatized. We won't be going back.

The buildings are so grand and of course, Disney thought of everything. We were there just prior to Christmas and everything was decked out. It wasn't overly \"Disney\" with the exception of a few characters in the pool area. We found all the staff to be very helpful and friendly. We are DVC members, so had a 2 bedroom villa. We were two families of four and were very comfortable in the spacious and very well-stocked unit. Costco and Safeway were a quick 5-10 mins away and we were able to get everything we needed there for breakfasts, lunches, snacks, beverages, etc. We ate most of our evening meals out but not at Aulani as we had read unimpressive reviews. Likely should have given them a try to form our own impression, but enjoyed two different restaurants at the neighbouring JW Marriott (Azul - Italian and the informal poolside restaurant Naupaka Terrace) and also the Marriott Beach Club's Chuck's Restaurant. All three were excellent. The beach at Aulani is outstanding although chairs can be difficult to obtain mid-day unless you are not shy to go around to unused chairs and see if any belongings were left on them. The beach staff were really good at making sure people didn't abuse using chairs. If chairs were not occupied or had personal items on them, they were quickly moved for other hotel guests to use. Some people thought they could disappear for hours and just leave their resort towel to reserve...no way. The beach was really clean, and not packed at all which was really pleasant. Our kids rented paddle boards one afternoon and loved it. We were with older teens, so they didn't partake in the sting ray area, etc. The slides and lazy river were great fun though. The infinity hot tub was a favorite toward the end of the day for our kids, but too busy for the adults' liking. There were other quieter hot tubs tucked here and there which were nice touches on Disney's part. We checked the spa out, but found it kind of pricey and didn't want to be inside anyhow because the weather was fantastic and we preferred to be out on the beach or by the pool. Both of our families rented cars at the airport and parking at Aulani was free for DVC members which was really nice as I've heard the fees can be steep. Reviewers must remember though that this is a 5 star hotel and parking at any 5 star hotel, in such a desirable location, can be expensive, so I don't think that it is fair to criticize Aulani for expensive parking as some have. We took day trips to Honolulu's Waikiki Beach for the surf and Hanauma Bay for snorkeling. Both were great fun. It was quite rough the day we hit the bay for snorkeling, so things were churned up a bit and we were limited on where we could safely go. The drive takes about 40 mins from Aulani but is in a gorgeous location. Well worth the trip. Surfing on Waikiki Beach was great! Kids loved it. The adults sat under rented umbrellas (the sun was hot) while the four teens surfed for about an hour. Make a deal with the surf companies...there are so many of them and they definitely want your business. After being on the beach, we hit some shops one street in from the beach (great high end shops mixed with middle of the road shops) and then went to eat at PF Chang's. Pearl Harbour is not to be missed and a trip to Oahu would be incomplete without visiting it. Try to get there early too! Lots of see there and it takes quite a while to see even one small portion. We only managed to see the Arizona Memorial and the Battleship Missouri and we were there for about 4 hours. We'll go back next time we're in Oahu to see the other sites there. Our vacation flew by and we were all sad to leave. We're already planning our return to Aulani as I write this!

Off the Hook has some standard fare but also some weird combinations that don't necessarily work. Nice dining options outside the hotel appeared to be limited to a couple other hotels; Roy's in Kapolei was closed when we were there due to a kitchen fire and didn't know when they'd reopen. Note that the hotel is fairly removed (especially if you consider the common gridlock traffic on the highway) from Honolulu, which can be good and bad, depending on what you want to do on the island. The Ohana massage at Laniwai is a great way to include kids in relaxation--we had a great time with that.

Not even an arrangement with a shuttle van service. To and from the Airport, the concierge will \"try\" to book a cab for you which will cost $100 each way. (20 minute journey) We didn't want to, but hired a car and drove, (parking fees $30.00 a day). All in all, not a very 'green' or convenient transport policy. Why worry about reusing towels ? Get a grip disney, buy a mini van ! Given the price of the rooms at this resort, it is only spoiled by the penny pinching and over pricing, which gives feeling of poor value for money. Other resorts in this price range include much more at the same price point. The dinner buffet is massively over priced for what is on offer.

There's also a lounge for early check-out-er's to use for showers and watching a game. The resort has a large freeform pool. Separate is a small water park for younger children with the usual fountains, spraying water and a water canoe that dumps water every X mins. There are two water slides - one a body and the other with a tube. And a huge lazy river. There were enough tubes for the lazy river but the slide lines would get long at certain times. Beach access is just past the pools and is in a cove, so there's no danger of waves. One suggestion - buy the souveneir mug for $20 and all fountain drinks, coffee and hot chocolate are free for your entire stay. A definite value considering soft drinks are otherwise $4.

If your are traveling with younger children and want a very relaxing experience, this resort is a great option. It provided most of the advantages of a Disney resort without most of the negatives. We were welcomed and given a brief tour and overview of the resort with a focus on activities for our 6 and 8 year old in a fun Hawaiian style. Our room was a partial ocean view which was beautiful (and sufficient considering the difference in price for a full ocean view). The room was small, but nice, clean and comfortable. The room service was great, there was always a flower, treat, or something nice left on my children's pillow. I would recommend on asking for a room as high as possible (better views). The pools and beach were fantastic. My children loved the watersides, hot tubs, many swimming pools and aunty's beach house (the kids club house where they could check in and participate in activities, games, arts and crafts, etc.), all of which are open late. The beach was nice (and not crowded when we were there). We saw jelly fish, turtles, and by walking up the shore, saw crabs, fish and other sea creatures. We also payed to have access to the Rainbow Reef (a salt water snorkeling pool with tons of tropical fish). My children loved it and went there every day. Don't underestimate the value of Aunty's beach house (my kids never wanted to leave); it gave my wife and I time to be together and know my children were having fun also. The restaurants were a bit expensive with average food, but not bad. The options were a little limited, so we walked just outside the resort to a small group of restaurants across the street and the ABC store for a change of menu and some snacks, which was nice. The employees were always friendly (in usual Disney style), and would help any way possible (especially in aunty's beach house). The resort had several times to meet and take photos with the disney characters, had great Hawaiian performers dance and play music (involving the audience) almost every night. One of the nights they had a big event with a performance worth adjusting your schedule to attend (lots of dancing, singing, disney characters, etc.) Overall, the resort was a nice mix of pools, beach, Disney, Hawaiian culture, relaxation and fun for a family with younger children.

That said, if you have small kids who want to meet the characters, they won't be disappointed. The service was wonderful. My husband and I had requested to upgrade to a room with a king bed. Upon arrival, we were told that one was not available the first night, but that there would be one available starting the second night. They took my husband's cell number and said they'd call when it was ready the next day. Sure enough, around 11:00 the following day they said the new room was ready, and they had our luggage delivered there. No fuss! Later on the trip, my husband lost his room key while snorkeling. They replaced it immediately - again, not even the slightest inconvenience from the staff. The beds are very soft and comfy, and the windows and doors in the rooms are excellent at keeping sound out. Disney has gotten very good at keeping kids and teens out of the way. There's a special hangout place for kids as well as one for teens, plus a teen spa, so the \"grown-up\" spa wasn't swarming with giggling teenyboppers (which was a concern for me!). The pool is probably the BEST hotel pool I have ever seen - two water slides, a looong lazy river, a quiet pool (with its own bar), a family pool, four hot tubs, a saltwater snorkel lagoon (stocked with fish), a stingray pool, a gigantic kids play area, a shave ice stand, sundries shop, a couple of bars and snack shops, and lots of seating and umbrellas. There are lifeguards everywhere, too -- safety is clearly a priority. You can really see the Disney magic touches all over the place. The Volcano in the middle of the pool area has all kinds of subtly-carved animals hidden in the rocks, the lights at the bottom of the family pool make the shapes of Hawaiian constellations, the shadow of the hula girl on the lamp in front of Aunty's Beach House dances occasionally... the surprises never end for those who look. I highly recommend that kids OR adults try the Menehune adventure game - you get a little smartphone that gives you clues to go to different sites around the pool area, and when you find them, things ... happen. Rocks move, lava begins to flow - it's actually really cool even for adults. I only wish they had a few more dining options. Disney probably assumes you'll be spending time in Waikiki or Honolulu, but I wish they had more than the two restaurants. Both restaurants were fantastic, but still. I'd also like to see a few more quick-service menu items, or at least a different menu at the different quick service food establishments.

Overall it was a fun and relaxing vacation. The hotel met our expectations since we researched other reviews before we left so we were aware of some of the limited and expensive dining choices, the need for reservations and other issues voiced by reviewers here. The things I liked: -The rooms are beautiful and spacious, the beds are comfortable. We had a standard hotel room and not a timeshare unit. We did not pay extra for a pool or ocean view and I do not regret it. One of the people we met while there said they asked to be moved out of their pool view room due to the noise. - The pool area is really fun. My daughter and I loved the lazy river and she liked the water play area also. But for swimming we went to the smaller, quieter Wailana pool which always had less people, a lot more shade and also had its own bar and table service so we weren't missing anything. - The service was good. There were hiccups but for the most part the staff is very friendly, helpful and efficient. Check-in was very smooth and overall we were pleased with how attentive the staff was. - The spa is AMAZING and not to be missed. It is beautifully designed and the relaxation garden is really nice. - Dinner and Breakfast at the Ama Ama restaurant. Dinner can be pricey but the food is good. Breakfast was not unreasonable and you cannot beat the view since the restaurant is right above the beach. - The hula show. Aulani puts on a nice hula show on the garden lawn two nights a week. It's a really nice show and we all enjoyed it. The two guys who play the Ukelele are amazing. The things I found disappointing: - The first two days at the resort felt crowded. The hotel is only 60% in use and already there were no chairs available by the pool by mid-morning. The hotel claims to have a policy that they will clear your chair if you leave for more than an hour but when the three of us finally found one chair to share for the afternoon, we noticed that our neighbors were gone for well over three hours and no one came or remove their things and free-up the chair for another guest. I cannot imagine how they will accommodate all the guests at the pool when the resort is at full capacity. - The dinner buffet at Makahiki was extremely disappointing. The food was below average and it is very expensive for what you get. Twice we went to buffets at the restaurant at the J.W. Marriott Ihilani (next door to the Aulani and just a quick walk down the beach path). The food was better, the price was less and kids under five eat free with a paying adult so I recommend that if you want a buffet. The restaurant menu is also good. The Japanese restaurant there also has a nice buffet. - As others mentioned, reservations are recommended for the restaurants so we made them in advance. However each time we got to a restaurant we noticed that there were lots of empty tables and people were still waiting and being turned away. I am not sure why they cannot accomodate everyone who wants to have dinner and why people have to wait if there are so many empty tables. We inquired about why this was the case and were told it was due to the fact that they had limited servers. It seems like they should have realized by now that they need more servers. Again, I am not sure how they will manage the situation with the restaurants when the hotel is at full capacity. - After three days the pool bar menu got very old. It would be nice if they switched the menu certain days of the week since there aren't any other options for casual/quick lunch at the property right now. (The quick service restaurant was not open while we were there). - Aunty's Beach House was not what I expected. The staff is really great and professional and the facility is really nice but there aren't enough engaging activities for the kids. It feels more like a babysitting service than a kids' camp. We went to another family resort in the Caribbean during the same week last year and the kids activities there were much more exciting for our daughter, now 6. She could not wait to go to the kids program there and was not at all excited about Aunty's Beach House. She attended one \"premium\" activity that cost $79 dollars for three hours and she did not seem that excited about it when we picked her up. This is a very nice resort. We had a great vacation and are glad we went. The DIsney aspect of it is understated and we were pleasantly surprised that we were not bombarded with characters and gift shops at every corner. I am not sure we would go back due to our concern about how crowded the resort will feel when they open the second building completely.

We expected the food to be expensive and it was. We expected the food to be disappointing, so we tried to avoid eating at Aulani. Honestly our best three dinners were all at Aulani so there really are not a lot of better or cheaper options. We rented DVC points (154 points for $1,540) and stayed for 7 nights in December. This was a great deal compared to the listed rack rates. We rented a car and were offered free self-park (because we booked with DVC points). We conveniently drove a few miles south to Kapolei and purchased groceries so we didn't need to eat breakfast or lunch out. Our biggest disappointment was Auntie's Beach House. I had read a review stating \"their 7 year old never wanted to leave Auntie's\". Going in with that hope and expectation was a mistake. Our 7 year old son wanted nothing to do with Auntie's. To his credit, although beautiful and nicely appointed, Auntie's felt like a glorified daycare center with a prison gate and tracking bracelets. Most of the kids seemed younger (3-5) and there was not a lot to entertain a second grader (except for video games). We had to seriously bribe and force our son to go there. In total he spent about 6 hours at Auntie's. To end on a positive note, while our son was locked-up at Auntie's we tried the Laniwai Spa. I went in a skeptic... not sure I could justify $160 plus tax and tip for a 50 minute massage. The spa was delightful and exceeded my expectations. You must, MUST make the time for a treatment.

There were lots of neat little touches, from the lights in the pools being Hawaiian constellations, to the beautiful lobby with the photos taken by Hawaiian grade school kids. We had an island view, but you saw a good portion of the parking lot. I wouldn't pay extra for it over the standard view. I liked the studio, but next time I think I will get the one bedroom. It would have been handy for eating in, especially since there are so few restaurants within walking distance. The grounds were beautifully landscaped, unfortunately when we were there they were moving a lot of stuff around (they moved the towel/pool bracelet tent) and were doing a lot of replacement work on the concrete. The water slides were a lot of fun; especially the dark tunnel. One of our favorite things though was the lazy river. We probably spent at least 1 hour a day floating around the river. The nighttime stories were really good, but the fire wasn't working a lot of the time. The pools and the infinity hot-tubs were amazing. We also bought length of stay passes for the snorkelling. My daughter was too timid to go to the ocean and loved seeing the fish up close. They also had a paid \"Fish are Friends\" activity at Aunty's Beach house. It was expensive ($50) but it included a movie, lunch, feeding the fish, a copy of Disney Oceans and a lot of information from the biologists. It was really well done and worth the money. She ended up being the only kid, so all of the castmembers ended up calling her the VIP princess for the rest of the trip. Another thing that was really educational was the sting ray excursion. I thought it was really neat how well trained they were. They would swim up ramps and do loops for food; I had no idea how intelligent they were. One of the big disappointments for me was the food; I thought it was pretty limited and expensive. I also thought Ama Ama wasn't very good, we all thought the food was so-so and my daughter hated her pizza. Makahiki had better food, but it was way overpriced, especially for dinner. The breakfast was a lot of fun and not quite as overpriced in my opinion (comparible to the Disney character breakfasts at Disneyworld and Disneyland). We ate quite a bit at the store across the street, especially for breakfast (which was cheap and OK). The mexican restaurant was pretty good, especially the mocajete. We also ate twice at Roy's. It was cheaper than the resort and way better. My daughter (8) loved Aunty's beach house, but there wasn't so much for my 12 year old boy to do. Aunty's beach house is for kids up to 12, he would go to help entertain his sister, but it was really too little for him. There were some limited tween activities, but not very many. Most were for 14+ that he would have liked, for example beach games and fitness challenges. We ended up spending a lot of time in the family room. I have to say all of the staff, especially the family and kid councellers were wonderful. They were really friendly and learned your name pretty quickly. At the end, they said my son could participate in some of the teen activities since he was so well behaved, but by then it was a too late. We really enjoyed the crafts, especially the ones that you had to pay for. The person who did the featherworking was extremely knowledgeable. The lady who did the plaiting was good, but it didn't take very long (30-45 minutes). It was a little pricey at $30 a person. My daughter did the stingray adventure which was well worth the money. They had some good tours like the Art tour and the wildlife tour. There were a lot of free activities to do. We really liked the Starlit Hui show that was on Monday and Thursdays. The crafts ahead of time were a lot of fun. The other thing that we really liked was the stargazing. There are 2 versions, the free one, which was very interesting and we went on. I would have liked to go on the one you paid for, they actually had telescopes out and an astronomer. Another big disapointment was that we booked 3 of the disney tours before we left, Mahoa falls, Wakaimea falls and the cooking with Sam Choy. All were cancelled because not enough people signed up (you needed 10 and we were the only ons for all 3). We had planned to do Wakaimea falls ourselves, but by the time we found it was cancelled there was the first surfing competition on the North Shore so it would have been very difficult to get there. All in all, we loved it enought to buy an Aulani timeshare. We were all really sad to leave. If they did something for the tweens, especially active boys, and the food, the resort would be perfect. It is certainly worth going on DVC points for a week; I don't know that I would stay at the rack rates; especially for a whole week.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cNot perfect.. but very close\u201d", "Author": "kmi_28", "ReviewID": "UR122690988", "Content": "My sister\u2019s job was offering discounted rates at Aulani for a few weeks in December. So we set out for a \u201csisters-only\u201d 9-day vacation mid-month. We both live in NYC and I travel often for work. So, I\u2019ve stayed in many 5-star hotels all across the U.S. [Translation: I\u2019ve got pretty high standards!] But I was excited and optimistic (even though I had read some not-great reviews of the place) for my first trip to Hawaii. We arrived at Aulani just after sunset and were really blown away by the beauty of the lobby. Check-in was a breeze and everyone was really friendly and helpful (this is something that impressed me daily during our entire stay.) The property is stunning. The layout of the pool and restaurants is really something to see, especially at night. It\u2019s so \u201cHawaiian!\u201d (I was pleased it didn\u2019t feel so \u201cDisney.\u201d Personally, that was not the experience I was looking for.) Our room had a partial ocean view (partial ocean also meant partial parking structure\u2013 but considering my NYC apartment overlooks the back of other apartments buildings, I was thrilled. And we saw rainbows almost daily!) The room was a bit smaller than I expected, but very clean and that\u2019s what matters most. Plus, the beds were outstanding. In fact, I pulled back the sheets to see what kind of mattress I was sleeping so soundly on every night \u2013 it was THAT dreamy. Housekeeping kept the room extremely tidy during our stay \u2013 plenty of towels, prompt cleaning and turndown service. All good there. Since we scheduled our trip pre-Christmas break, I was surprised at how many families were actually vacationing that week. The hotel seemed to be fully booked and the pool area was jam-packed with excited kids enjoying the lazy river, pools and hot tubs. I was a little disappointed there was no \u201cadults only\u201d area (especially for the hot tubs,). So, during our stay, I never even dipped my toe. That\u2019s a strike against the place, I suppose. But, the beach really made up for it. We rented our umbrella and lounges before 10am every day, and then relaxed an enjoyed til at least 5pm. $20 for a full day umbrella was worth every penny. Everyone at Makiki Joe\u2019s was so helpful and accommodating. After just 2 days, they were addressing us by name and could not have been more pleasant. (Same goes for the valets. They always greeted us with an \u201cAloha, miss ___.\u201d) We originally planned to indulge in a few spa treatments during our stay, but once we arrived, we knew we wanted to make the most of the outdoors and warm sun before returning to another grey, NYC winter. We also took advantage of the Hawaiian Ocean Adventures canoe adventure and paddleboard lessons. Don\u2019t pass this up during your stay. It cost extra, but was so worth it. Our canoe/catamaran ride was a highlight for sure. It was a peaceful (and fun) one hour ride on the blue, blue water of Hawaii. The guys that run HOA are just the BEST. So friendly and nice and really excited to share what they love about the ocean and Hawaii with Aulani guests. I learned even more during my one-hour paddleboard lesson with them. They were happy to recommend some great places for us to visit, and things to do beyond the confines of the hotel property. We took their advice and they absolutely did not steer us wrong. I can\u2019t say enough nice things about them and we really enjoyed chatting with them every day. As some of these other reviews have mentioned, food options at Aulani are limited. During our stay we ate at Ama Ama (breakfast, lunch, dinner), the Makahiki buffet (breakfast, dinner), the Oleo room (breakfast) and Off the Hook (drinks and snacks). Yes, the service was a bit slow in spots but the servers were all so friendly it was hard to really get worked up about it. While the menu at Ama Ama is limited (come on people, you can\u2019t expect any hotel restaurant to have the offerings of a larger chain eatery), all three meals we ate there were good. Not the best I\u2019d ever eaten, but not as horrible as some have reported here. And honestly, the view and atmosphere was incredible. (Maybe that made the food taste better?) During dinner at Ama Ama, the live music and Hawaiian dancer really enhanced the ambience. It was just lovely. (We made reservations for all meals there.) The breakfast buffet at Makahiki, was good (we did not attend on the mornings of the character breakfast) and we had no problem getting a table without a reservation. The buffet dinner wasn\u2019t our favorite, but we just chalked it up to one so-so meal. The prices at the restaurants are standard to what you\u2019d find in any nice hotel. This is NOT an all-inclusive resort \u2013 you pay for your meals. So reviews of everyone\u2019s surprise and outrage at the prices are confusing to me. Why would anyone expect fast food prices at this resort?? And what\u2019s with all the praise everyone is heaping on the ABC store? Yes, it was convenient for snacks and stuff like that. But the sandwiches I purchased one day for lunch were not good. At all. And not cheap, either. We actually ended up tossing them. Unless you are buying food there to prepare yourself, get ready to be ripped off and unsatisfied. Since my sister and I were really looking for a relaxing getaway, we did not plan to rent a car during our stay. We knew the hotel offered excursions and we planned to take advantage. However, once we got more info at the Holoholo desk, we ended up only booking one day trip to the Big Island and decided it actually did make sense for us to rent a car for a few days to do some exploring on our own. (One caveat \u2013 the excursion met at the Honolulu airport \u2013 and Aulani did not provide transport to and from. That was a bit of a disappointment, I\u2019ll admit. Those cab rides add up.) As for renting a car, we were thrilled that we were able to do so right on the property. We rented it for 3 days and did not have to deal with any airport rental location hassles \u2013 you pickup and return right at Aulani. (Yes, parking was an extra $35-day \u2013a cost we didn\u2019t expect \u2013 but, what can you do.) We ventured out to Waikiki and Kapolei for drinks and dinner and it was nice to have that option. The food prices everywhere else were comparable to Aulani. (Starbucks was even more than what I pay here in NYC.) It\u2019s no big secret, people - Hawaii\u2019s not cheap. So save your money and enjoy yourself \u2013 if money\u2019s an issue \u2013 this might not be the vacation spot for you. Granted, I know that as two adults with essentially no budget concerns, our experience was quite different from that of larger families traveling with several small children. But it\u2019s unfair to knock the Aulani for NOT being a theme park with round-the-clock entertainment and fast-food vendors every five feet (Let\u2019s leave that to Disneyworld.) That\u2019s not what it professes to be. I will admit, I am curious how the prospect of more rooms opening in February will affect the resort. I\u2019m not quite sure the space can handle more people. The pool area seemed so full every day we were there. Multiply that with an entire tower of more rooms opening next month and well, I just don\u2019t know how that\u2019s gonna work out. Based on some other reviews I\u2019ve read here, Aulani\u2019s location seems to be one of the biggest points of contention. Aulani is located in Ko\u2019Olina. And no, it doesn\u2019t have the food and entertainment options of Waikiki. But, it does offer serenity and just sheer beauty that the more citified areas of Hawaii don\u2019t. Ironically, I thought the location was the real star of the show, and renting a car for even just a few days really was the way to go. Overall, I\u2019d say our experience at the hotel was really great and I would absolutely (and am already planning to) return there later this year.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201cMostly Good, but they need to make some adjustments\u201d", "Author": "flashbridgewater", "ReviewID": "UR122659649", "Content": "The Good/great part: We are Disney Vac Club members and used our points for an 11 day stay at Aulani. The place is brand new, opened Aug 2011, and smells like a new car(thats a good thing). The rooms are nice, we had a 1 bedroom unit, with washer/dryer, full kitchen and sleeps up to 5 comfortably. The pool, lazy river and slides were fun and enjoyable for my entire family. The beach was nice and relaxing, we snorkled in the lagoon and saw plenty of beautiful fish and sea life, rented a SUP (stand up surf/paddle board) and enjoyed ourselves. We will some day return. The not so good: The restaurants were EXPENSIVE, there are 4 restaurants, and while some are cheaper than others, they were all pricey and not worth the money. I recommend driving 15 minutes to Costco or Safeway and buying food...we did and saved a bundle. We also looked at the restaurants in walking distance, and while they were nice, they were also pricey. The beach didn't have enough chairs and the resort is only 2/3 open. Recommend they put 2 sand chairs in every DVC room so at least the DVC members have at least 2 chairs for their family. The beach is public, so if there are people on the Disney chairs without a wristband or Disney towel, tell the beach guards and they'll give them the boot from those chairs. There are only 3 free umbrellas on the Disney side of lagoon, and others are available for rent, really? The last day we were there they guards were finally monitoring the chairs around the pool for people that reserved them and then didn't come back for several hours, thats a good thing. Wife wanted a Spa experience, but the Spa is way too expensive, and always seemed empty, so I am not the only one who must think so.

We are Disney Vacation Club members and spent 7 nights in a studio at the resort on the 7th floor. Our room was beautifully appointed with a queen size bed as well as a sofa sleeper. The bathroom was very large and across the hallway from a small sink, refridgerator and microwave. The ocean and resort grounds view from our balcony was stunning with gorgeous sunsets. Being Disney as well as being in Hawaii - food was extremely expensive. We had rented a car at the airport (which I feel is a necessity!) thus allowing us to shop at a Super Target 2 - 3 miles away that had decent food prices (for Hawaii). There were several other super markets in the Kapolei area as well as many restaurants. Thus breakfast as well as lunch we would eat in our room somedays helping to keep food costs down. Otherwise expect to pay up to $100 plus eating at a resort restaurant. After purchasing the Aulani refillable drink cup for $18 - we enjoyed unlimited coffee, soft drinks, cocoa as well as tea throughout our entire visit - a bargain by any means. The grounds are beautifully landscaped having many different areas to enjoy the pools, the lazy river as well as the ocean. I especially enjoyed the several miles of wide walkways that ran alongside the ocean by the four man- made coves (very large coves). The beaches in Hawaii are public and there was a gate requiring your room key to open onto the Disney property. Every day there were at least 3 or 4 weddings on the beach as there were several wedding chapels down from the resort as well as many buildings of condo's. There were a lot of resort rooms that hadn't been furnished yet thus the resort was not completely open. My main concern was that it would be far less enjoyable to use the pool, lounges, and lazy river when 100% occupied as could become very crowded. The resort itself is architecturally beautiful with a predominance of beautiful wood panels, carvings, staircases, Hawaain art etc. - very Hawaiin and understated and not what you would think of when you think Disney. We would enjoy staying here again bringing our children and granchildren sometime in the future. One thing that we did NOT enjoy was the 6 lanes of traffic bumper to bumper for at least 15 miles getting from the airport to the resort between 4 and 7 p.m. Oh how we wished for disney transportation as driving a strange car in the dark in all this traffic gave us a headache! The traffic going into Honolulu in the morning can be just as bad. I took an excursion to Waikiki Beach one day where you are dropped off for the day and thoroughly enjoyed that - no driving! We had been to Oahu several times befor so did not take any other excursions. The week we spent there was wonderful - but you need to take a lot of money with you!

As we first walked into the lobby, a cast member gave us kukui nut leis, which was nice. As we walked into our \u201cdeluxe ocean view studio\u201d we couldn\u2019t help but notice the wonderful view of our neighboring Marriott\u2019s parking structure. Of course, we requested a different room, which they were able to accommodate, but not until the next day. The small inconvenience was definitely worth it; our new room had a wonderful view of the resort\u2019s pool and beach areas. So here is TIP #1: if you\u2019re expecting an ocean view, request an EVEN NUMBERED ROOM. The resort excels in children entertainment, let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s Disney. Auntie\u2019s Beach House is a must for any parent. This part of the resort is best suited for children ages 3 and up who are potty trained. If they meet the age requirement, you can leave your children with them and enjoy the adult accommodations like the spa or the fitness center. For additional fees, they offer \u201cpremier entertainment\u201d. We have a 5 and a 2 year old, so we couldn\u2019t take full advantage of this. TIP #2: Auntie\u2019s beach house and the resort for that matter are really worth it if your kids are 3 years or older and potty trained. Visit the Kalepa\u2019s store located near the lobby, the merchandise there is extremely expensive, but if you\u2019re a coffee or soft drink lover you can\u2026 TIP #3: purchase an $18 tumbler and get free refills throughout your stay. If you are renting a car, expect to pay $35 a day for parking UNLESS you are a DVC member, they waive that fee if you\u2019re ever-so-lucky. Also if you have transportation, the neighboring town Kapolei has everything you need. Any kind of restaurant you can think of, supermarkets, a movie theatre, even a Costco can be found in this town. TIP #4: if you\u2019re looking to save money on food, visit Kapolei. The character breakfast is fun for kids and a must since you\u2019re staying at a Disney resort. TIP #5: book this as early as possible. This experience is available for anyone, not just guests, so it sells out. I suggest, as soon as you book your room, inquire about reserving your character breakfast. Every day the resort has character meet and greets, special events for kids both during the day and at night, complimentary trams to shopping areas (this isn\u2019t every day), so TIP #6 is: make it a habit to every morning or the evening before, pick up a bulletin at the lobby which has the days schedule. Upon an early check in or a late check out, the resort has a very nice visitor\u2019s center which has computers, printer, showers, lockers which means you can still enjoy the resort even if you don\u2019t have a room.

Research before you book. For all who are complaining of little to do at this resort, who did not rent a car, who are complaining of the lack of choices in dining and the outrageous cost, it is Hawaii. You go to Hawaii to see Hawaii, not to sit at a hotel all day long and be entertained by cartoon characters. Hawaii is a vacation destination. One of the main sources of income for the state is tourism. Disney built a star rated hotel to capture some of that revenue. If you want to see Disney characters and be entertained, then go to Disney World instead. And for those \"older\" guests complaining about screaming children--- the name \"Disney\" should have given you a big clue that this is what you would see and hear. I admit the dining experience leaves much to be desired, but why would you expect to eat all your meals at this resort when you are in Hawaii? Disney dining anywhere is mediocre, at best. The pleasure of being in Hawaii is to experience all that Hawaii has to offer. We have been to Hawaii too many times to even count but each time we visit Oahu, I have to go to the Arizona Memorial. I have to visit the North Shore. I have to visit Waikiki. The scenery of Hawaii is gorgeous. Why would you spend all your time at a resort to see artificial lagoons and fake volcanoes when you can experience the real thing that makes Hawaii the paradise it is? Just driving around, with the top down, is an experience to savor. Ko'Olina is far removed from the bustle of Waikiki. Did you not see this before you traveled? Hawaii traffic is ridiculous. On one visit, we were stuck in traffic that took us 90 minutes to travel 5 miles. Its Hawaii. That is just how it is. We booked Aulani because it is a new resort, away from Waikiki and we wanted to see how Disney does Hawaii. You need a rental car. But you need a rental car at every resort on every island if you plan to actually visit Hawaii. The Aulani is a resort, it is not a destination.

I then found out about Aulani in July and being such a Disney fan, changed our flights (at some cost) to reroute and spend the first 5 days of the trip at Aulani. My son developed strep throat 9 days prior to our flight out. He was put on antibiotics right away and showed immediate improvement. The doctor said it was no problem for him to continue his trip as he had no symptons within 2 days of the antibiotics. He took the entire 10 day prescription, the last pills on day 3 of Aulani. The next day, however, the symptoms came back. By dinnertime it was clear he needed more antibiotics. We left dinner and went back to the room, I told my husband to finish his dinner and I would have front desk phone the on call physician to come and see my son. When I called front desk, I was told that there is no doctor on call. Aulani is a 45 minute drive from the airport in Honolulu in the opposite direction of Waikiki. It is in a rather isolated location. I was told I could not go to the medical clinic as it is closed for the day at 5 pm. (It was 6:00 at the time of my conversation). I said what do we do? She said do you want me to call 911? No, I don't need an ambulance, he just needed to see a Dr for a new antiobiotic prescription. He needed to start the pills right away as he was getting worse and if we waited until morning he would be so ill he wouldn't be able to move.....we were to check out the next morning to fly to Maui. Front desk then said well you can leave a voice message at the clinic! How is that going to help? I did leave the voice message but then sent my husband to the front dest to talk with a manager. He came back with the same information....no Dr on call ....they gave him a print out of a map with directions to the nearest emergency room. In Honololu! 45 min drive away.

As many people who have attended Disney resorts know, you have to set you standards pretty low due to their lack of professionalism and cheapskate attitude. However, during our week at Aulani, even our already low standards were challenged. After a long flight from Detroit to Honolulu, we arrived at Aulani around 3:30 in the morning Detroit time. Tired and worn out, my family and I looked forward to a quick check in and go straight to bed, however when checking in, it was brought to our attention that Disney had only reserved us as a party of five rather than six (we called Disney prior to our trip several times to confirm that we had a party of six). Without an explanation or apology we were forced to wait an extra hour for Disney to correct their outrageous screw up. The following day, despite the beautiful grounds and enormous pool area, we were once again shocked by Disney. No one informed us that the breakfast buffet required a reservation beforehand or that they charge more per person when the Disney characters are present. We were forced to wait an hour for a table to open and once finished with an average at best buffet line, we were greeted with a $130 bill for only three as the rest of our group didn't want to eat breakfast. We never ate at the resort again. You would probably think that there is nothing left to complain about but there is. During a week long stay at the resort you would think that the maids would clean out your room or change your towels at least once, not the case. After several calls to the front office, we were never once attended to. We finally had to physically find a maid on our floor and force her to just change our dirty towels, but still no cleaning of the room or removal of trash ever occurred. I also must add that the grounds of Aulani do not provide many fun excursions. While the pool grounds are nice, if you are an older person or just don't enjoy swimming, you don't have much to do. For example, we enjoy playing tennis when on vacation, upon arrival there were tennis courts all over the grounds. However, when we tried to use them we were sent back every time. This is because Disney doesn't own any of the tennis courts themselves. One set belongs to the golf club across the street which only allows club members, while the other tennis courts at the Marriott are exclusively used by only Marriott guests. When we talked to the front desk about it, they told that they had no rental agreements for either site and basically that we were screwed. All in all, our trip outside of the resort was quite nice, I highly suggest that you spent as much time away from Aulani as possible as well as avoiding eating there at all costs. However, if left with the choice of Aulani, I would recommend the Marriott across the street which is cheaper, more organized and has far more things to do for those who don't rent a car during their stay. I must also add that unless you are a Disney Vacation Club member, you have to pay $35 dollars a day for parking. I believe that they only charge $15 dollars a day at the Marriott.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cNew Resort.

Marriott right in the middle of our ocean view. There were several questions I asked at the time of the sale that the 20+ year veteran sales person was deceptive about. After some hemming and hawing, I was able to get him to admit that it was another resort but he claimed he didn't know the name. I asked how many stories tall it was because it was certain to block the view of half of the Aulani Resort unless it was low rise. He claimed he didn't know how tall it was. I asked if the vacation club rooms were in the tower behind the unknown and mysterious \"existing building\" and he claimed he didn't know. The answer is that the Disney Vacation Club rooms are in a 16 story tower directly behind a 20 story J.W. Marriott. Yes you can see ocean from the ocean room's balcony if you look to the side of the Marriott. No, you cannot see the ocean from many areas of the guest rooms. No, there not a place in our room where you do not see the Marriott. Do not spend the extra dollars (or points) on an ocean view room. Mountain view or pool view may actually be more appealing and cheaper. Now on to the big issue, the Food and Beverage operation. They are very deep in the weeds. Food quality is poor. Service is poor. Selection is poor. There are not enough outlets to serve the guests. You literally cannot eat here unless you book \"months in advance\" according to the hostess at 'Ami 'Ami. The hotel is set off in a sparsely populated area of the island so there are not a lot of options near the resort either. The Marriott adjacent has several restaurants that are well managed albeit a bit old and worn. Disney probably needs to create at least one additional outlet. Come up with some new menus. Convert the existing buffet dinner restaurant into one with a menu with broad appeal. Get their act together on room service. We actually had similar issues with dinner at the Grand Californian. You have only two choices for dinner either very expensive gourmet dining or very expensive dinner buffet. The difference in California is that there are numerous other options in Downtown Disney. The outside options are few at Aulani. On the positive side, the beach is fantastic, the spa is amazing, the resort is brand new and therefore in excellent condition. The landscaping is awesome. The pool is great. You can see elements of a top notch Disney resort in the works here. Resorts are a big, complicated business to run.

The resort grounds are beautiful but confined to a small area. For a Disney resort, we were disappointed not only with the size but the service mostly in the food area. There are only 2 resorts on the resort that only take reservations and no walk up service. We actually saw people turned away at Ana Ana because they had no reservation even though there were empty tables. As for the quality of food, it was horrible. I am shocked at Disney allowing this type of service for hotel guests along with vacation club members. Mistakes were made at every meal we had. Food on the buffet was luck warm and by the time our reservation rolled around, they were out of foods of our choice. On a brighter note, we had a flood in our room with the clothes washer. We called down to have someone come immediately. The engineer staff was excellent not only in their answering our call but without question, replacing the washer within an hour with a brand new one. They also left us a note of thanks for letting them serve us and asked if we needed anything else not to hesitate and call. Bravo for the electrical and maintenance staff. We enjoyed Aulani's out of the way spot on the island of Oahu. We found this side of the island to be the sunniest and quiet. Since all we wanted to do was to chill out, this was perfect for our family. Overall, there are some things to be worked out with Aulani especially when they get 250 more vacation club units available. We would like to see the Disney quality and service prevail at this resort. Hopefully, next year we will be back to see if improvements have been made.

The ABC store has most of your grocery needs and has a deli with a reasonably llarge menu. I would definitely recommend getting a refillable mug for the length of your stay; it will save you a ton of money on drinks, especially poolside. The resort itself is absolutely amazing. Aulani shares a cove with the Mariott next door. For $99 per person for the length of your stay, you can get unlimited use snorkeling (even in the reef), paddleboarding, kayaking, and umbrella chairs. The staff is always there to help and more than happy to help. There is a community center with an activities staff and we are still missing them. Look at the daily newsletter for their schedule; they have everything from hula dancing lessons to making bracelets. If you have young kids, they host pool games, surfing lessons, and fishing games, all with the Disney characters. At some point during your stay, make sure to take part in scavenger hunt or Menahune trail. Parts of he resort actually \"come to life.\" There is a lifeguard at every corner of the pool and lazy river, so safety is never a concern for the little ones. If you have a chance to take advantage of a spa service, be sure to use the hydrotherapy area. Jungle themed, the shower walls are truly amazing.

The suite was a one bedroom and had a practical layout, with the tub in a separate but connected room to the toilet and shower area.

We had a confirmed reservation in writing but were told upon going down to the restaurant that they did not do character breakfasts on that day. Even though this was their mistake and not ours, they apologized perfunctorily and said they could try to fit us in at 7 am for the next breakfast and that was all. They seemed like they didn't care even though they acknowledged it was their mistake. The food is not up to par. It is average at best, inedible at worst and very expensive.

Everything you would expect from a Disneyland or Disney World resort is here - theming, atmospheric lighting, music, cleanliness, and friendly service. The rooms with 2 queen sized beds were large and for us, luxurious. The beds were soft and very comfortable, towels very thick. The whole family loved the water activities provided. The water slides were fun, and the lazy river was long and beautiful, with gorgeous trees and nicely themed rocks, waterfalls, and lighting abound. The whole resort is even better at night, with beautiful floodlights on the hotel towers, nicely lit sidewalks, and wonderful little fountain bowls everywhere that have a red light in them to make the water appear to be a flame. Family also loved the resorts beach and lagoon. The breakwaters keep the surf to a minimum, which makes it a great place to swim or learn how to snorkel. We also got to see a turtle or two. Meals at the resort are a challenge, because the restaurants are very expensive, but we were expecting this. What worked for us is eating breakfast at Aulani's Ama Ama, an open air place right by the beach, and having dinner at the inexpensive Just Tacos across the street. Ama Ama is very expensive for dinner, like $35 a meal on up, but their newly offered breakfast is only $8 to $20 and very good. Just Tacos is a flavorful Tex-Mex place across the street from the resort. Another good option for budget travelers is Aulani's One Paddle-Two Paddle. They had good burgers and pork sandwiches in the $15 range, but are a counter eatery and you must take your food to a table. Airport transportation to Aulani is limited. We didn't want a rental because we were taking a cruise afterwards, plus Disney charges $30 a day to park, so we found a decent taxi service on line that charged $50 for a family of four.

The Resort is located on the South-Western side of Oahu, so you are about 1 to 1 1/2 hours away from Waikiki and any real \"hawaiian shopping\" as well as the hustle and bustle and about 45 minutes to the North Shore. I have listed below the positives and negatives: Positives: The resort is in the middle of paradise and Disney has done a beautilful job in creating a Hawaiian feeling, the beach, which you share with the Marriott, is perfect for children and great for snorkeling (turtles and plenty of fish), the staff is very attentive in every way. Being DVC members, we stayed in a studio - perfect size kitchen area with good sized refridgerator, the bathroom is very nice and the robes are wonderful. The highlight for our 8 year old son was Aunty's Beach House, in all of the Disney Resorts that we have been to, including the Ships, our son thinks this is the best - he made tons of friends, they have the latest video games, activities for children inside and outside, movies, experiments and the Cast Members are truly amazing, they do everything they can to make sure your child is having a great time. If you child wants to attend one of the \"free\" classes, be sure to arrive 30-45 minutes to guarantee a spot or drop them off at Aunty's beforehand, the children in \"camp\" get first choice. If you have a room with the kitchen, we would highly recommend going to the market across the street and loading up on breakfast and lunch foods (the deli at the market is very good) - this will cut down on the costly food at the Resort. Also be sure to get the ABC card at the market, if you keep all of your receipts, on the day when you leave they will total your receipts and give you a gift - we chose two children's t-shirts, mugs and beach towels were other options. With regards to the cars, as we are DVC members, you don't pay for parking; however, to avoid what appears to be pricey parking charges, I would recommend only renting a car when you need it, we rented a car for a day, drove around the island to see some sites, took a day or two off, rented a car again when we found something else that you wanted to see. Negatives: If you have traveled with Disney in Florida you are familiar with the Magical Express, unfortunately Hawaii doesn't offer this service, Charley's Taxi has the best price - should be about $55 (cars are not fancy but they arrive on time) (other companies were charging in excess of $100), food is very pricey and just okay and really doesn't have a lot of options for children, other than exercise classes, the beach and pool (which is very cold), there is really not a lot for adults to do - would have been fun to have beach volleyball, some ping pong, foosball tables, etc. The dinner buffet is very pricey ($40+ per person), not enough selection and only had one worker in the back so you have to wait for new food to come out when they run out, the childen's buffet table only offers pizza, macaroni and cheese and one other item for children - I don't believe that I have ever eaten a pizza or mac n cheese worth $40.00. All in all, this was a very nice trip at a beautiful Resort.

The beds are very high, which isn't ideal for kids that still might fall out. It would nice to see rooms that are a little bigger and more geared for kids. Not sure why Disney doesn't build hotels hat have family friendly rooms. The Disney resort in Japan has really nice family rooms. Like all of the reviews mentioned food is scarce and very expensive. Buffet is quite expensive $44 for adults and has fairly limited selection. The other restaurants have fairly limited menus, especially for kids or picky eaters, and are expensive. Across the street is an abc store to get basic supplies and to restaurants. We went to the Mexican restaurant and the food was good and prices fair. Not sure why they haven't built a family restaurant in the strip mall with such a big captive audience.

When we heard that Disney was opening a hotel in Honolulu, we thought it would be fun to try it. It is in an area far from Waikiki that is just being developed. The hotel has almost no Disney theme experiences, which i consider a good thing. In no way is it a theme place, just a very nice time share/apartment type hotel. The rooms are similar to the rooms at a Disney resort--we had the two bedroom, two bath with LR/DR kitchen in the middle. This is so convenient when you have little kids with you and you can eat breakfast or lunch in the room. This hotel was not luxurious, but the rooms were very nice and user friendly and the public spaces were very creative and attractive. The pool area was exceptionally nice because it was divided into many different areas, such as water slide, adult pool, kids pool, hot tubs scattered around---and mostly you cannot see one area when you are at another--which gives a feeling of privacy---rather than one big pool with chairs wedged around. The beach was a spectacular cove, with lots of chairs and lounges --a beautiful view and a terrific place to swim or play in the water. There was also a view of this beach from some of the hots tubs and sitting areas around the pool, which was another nice touch. So I give this hotel an A. BUT (!) I have to give the food a D!!! It is disgraceful that they could not have better food there. For example, the poolside lunch place had a kids' menu with \"macaroni, cheese and peas\" !!! Give me a break! We went to a $$$ dinner buffet and the children's section consisted of a few pieces of dried out pizza and some mac and cheese under some heat lights. The adults food wasn't really anything too good, either. I cant figure out why they cant have good food though. We ate at some other restaurants in the area and I admit they weren't any good either. Since this is a newly developing area--even within driving distance there wasn't anywhere good to eat. Our choice on a few nights, which was suggested to us by other guests, was to walk to a very nice market (i think it was an ABC store) across the street and get some food to bring back to the apartment. If you care anything at all about dining well on a trip, this is not the place for you.

I will mention a few minor issues with the restaurants at the end. The most concerning and surprising compaint I have is due to their rather shocking lack of support when a child has a medical concern. My son was diagnosed with strep throat 9 days prior to departure. He was started on antibiotics immediately and responded quickly. Symptoms gone by day 3 but he took the entire 10 day prescription. Yesterday,2 days after the medication ended he started to feel unwell in the am. By dinner it was clear the strep throat was back. We left dinner early, and I brought him back to the room to have front desk call the Dr on call. To my surprise, Aulani, a five star family focused resort, does not have a Dr on call. Front desk asked if I wanted 911 called. I told them that was not necessary, he just needed to see a Dr for a new antibiotic. She said we could have gone to the medical clinic but it closed at 500, half an hour ago. She gave me the clinic phone number and I left a message....no one answered directly. So the next option given was for us to bundle him up and drive 40 min into Honololu to the emergency room. Thank goodness we had GPS or we would never have found it. I am most displeased.

From the amazing welcoming (take some lessons Moana Surfrider!) to check in to browsing in the stores to the life guards, everyone seemed to genuinely care about how we were doing and that we were having a great stay. I loved, loved, loved the aloha spirit and what felt like true ohana. I hope this hotel keeps up this attitude and doesn't lose it like Disney World has. Special kuddos go out to Wendy! She worked at one of the stores...the one by the pool...and was so awesome. Super friendly. She told me about the story behind the store and was just a pleasure to talk to.

Really hated the pillows. Not cumfty at all. Those and the prices were probably the worst things about the hotel. The prices for some things, well for most things, we're outrageous. The snorkel experience was waaaaayyyy expensive...around $40 I think. Same with the sting ray experience. Overall though it was a great hotel.

Overall we had a nice time and would bring our children back here in the future. If you are looking for a Disney experience with Mickey everywhere, this is NOT the place to be. If you have been to any of the other high-end Disney hotels before (i.e. the Grand Californian or Animal Kingdom Lodge), Aulani feels just like those hotels, except that it is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It is luxurious, nicely Hawaiian themed, clean, spacious, and the staff are super friendly. The lobby has a wonderful connection with the outdoors because of the high ceilings and fold away glass doors; you really get a sense of being outside, and the views are magnificant. Our 1 bedroom villa was nicely laid out and very clean. The slanted balconies are a bit awkward and not very large at all, but the we never felt closed in. We had been \"upgraded\" from a standard view to an island view, and that gave us a 5th floor location with an upclose view of the parking structure of the JW Marriott next door. I was quite disappointed with the island view. We later moved to an ocean view room, which was exactly the same but on the 10th floor. Still not particularly appealing, but we were able to see the ocean from that floor. The Grand Villas and the pool view side rooms have the best views, so be sure to request one of those if view is important to you. The pool area is not well shaded, so the seats under the few umbrellas filled up quickly. Even though part of the hotel was not yet finished, we arrived at the pool right when it opened in order to secure the spots we wanted, and we did hear about folks getting their seats taken when they left, even if they had beach towels saving them. So be aware that prime pool seats are going to be a premium in the hotter summer months (we were there in November after all) and when the hotel is at full capacity. There are two sets of cabanas, one by the main pool, and one by the little kid water park area. If you rent one of these, you may want to consider requesting a specific location since you may be expecting an ocean view only to be stuck next to screaming little ones. The hotel is quite far from EVERYTHING to do on Oahu, and the only outside food within walking distance was the ABC store across the street, or the restaurants at the nearby hotels. These retaurants included Roy's, so budget friendly food is really nowhere to be found within walking distance. One \"poor\" family I spoke with had taken a cab from the airport to the resort in order to avoid the $35/night parking fee (this is waived for villa guests), but breakfast for their family of 4 was close to $200, for ONE DAY. If you don't have a kitchen, you definitely need a car unless you plan on only eating Disney food the whole time, because even the little sundry store had little chose from. If you do have a car, there is a Target and a Costco, and also a small organic grocery store, about 1.5 miles away. My husband and I went to Costco on the first night and picked up prime steaks, lobster, bread, passion fruit juice, pork jerky, seaweed salad, a big bottle of rum, and a few other snackies and such for food for the week, and it cost us about $350. We only ate out 3 times the rest of the trip, one was a shrimp truck, one was sushi on the way to the airport, and one was a luau that was part of a tour we had booked. We did not buy any food at any of the restaurants at the hotel. I heard from other guests that the food was good, but overpriced. So those of you who chose to stay in the hotel, I hope you like eating out alot and don't mind paying for it. I had originally booked a spa pass for one day, but was told that there were no in-out priviledges...once you leave, that's it. So I cancelled that. The spa pass would have been $45. May be worth it in the future if you want privacy and to get away from the crowds at the resort, but now the trip we were there. The resort was very relaxing, but it was quite far from Honolulu, Waikiki, and the North Shore. Traffic is HORRIBLE. Even though it is approx. 17 miles away, it took us nearly 1.5 hours to get from the resort to Waikiki for the catamaran tour we had booked. It will also take you 1.5 hours to get back to the resort after 5pm. By the 3rd day, we decided to just stay at the resort, drink rum and passion fruit, and lay out by the pool so we could avoid the traffic. But if you want to do any activities outside the resort, be mentally prepared for a long commute even if the distance is short. All in all, I enjoyed the resort, but found it remote and highly inconvenient (and expensive!) if you don't have a car. Since we didn't go very many places and had a car, this didn't bother us too much, but did discourage us from exploring more of the island. The Ko 'Olina area shuts down after dark, so if you want night life, you'll have to brave going into Waikiki, and the only things really open there are bars and restaurants.

We experienced the Menehune interactive Trail, met all of the characters Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy and Stitch, meandered down the lazy river, raced down the water slides (the Volcano Vertical is a completely enclosed, dark, super fast slide!) - loads of picture taking opportunities and (mostly) handsome young lifeguards! The rooms were spacious and very well appointed, housekeeping brought me a microwave with serving utensils and plates (we brought food in, the reason why in a bit), and turn down service included a washcloth folded in the shape of an orchid, my house slippers and robe laid out for me. All rooms have an ocean view on some level. The details down to a consciousness for energy sustainability (eg ADA accessibility and Electric Vehicle parking stalls and charging stations), original Kealii Reichel music for Aulani greeting you upon entry, orchid or Kukui nut lei, are all noticed and appreciated.

I had 3 meals - a breakfast, lunch, and dinner - none in my opinion were satisfactory. Service was exemplary, food was tasteless and forgettable. I have to review the Spa...Yesterday (12/10/11) I had the pleasure of indulging in the state's only outdoor hydrotherapy garden at Laniwai Spa at Aulani, A Disney Resort. \u00a0As a guest of the hotel my cost was $45 to enjoy the facility without a treatment (for non-hotel guests I believe the day pass is more than $100). I was told I could spend as long as I wanted there for the day, but I could not have in and out privileges. I stayed for about four hours. I was shown a tour of this amazing facility by Becka. She described the essence of Laniwai and its central theme of water and the importance of water in our bodies and of our land. I selected a rock with the word \"Listen\" which was my word for the day. Throughout my journey of the day, Listening proved to me the best advice to help me savor and appreciate the sounds that surrounded me.\u00a0 The hydrotherapy garden consisted of a cool bubble tub that can double as an aromatherapy bath, and it had adjustable temperatures that cold be warmed to almost a room temperature so I could relax in there for a long time. The eucalyptus tub contained warm water (102 degrees) with herbs beneficial for relaxing sore muscles or relieving jet lag. \u00a0The herbs in another warm tub contained herbs for detoxification. \u00a0Drink lots of water, Becka advised, or I would wonder in three days why I am so thirsty...There was a reflexology foot path, a cold plunge pool set to a bone chilling 52 degrees, and jacuzzi that was about 104 degrees, and six experience showers that were sensitive to motion. There was one shower that try as I might, despite numerous gyrations, could not be activated. I'm sure the woman lounging on a nearby chair witnessed some bonus entertainment while I danced around trying to get the one defective shower to start its cycle. While outside I was offered cold water by Margo and a cold towel by a gentleman.\u00a0 Inside, I warmed up in the dry cedar sauna, grabbed a cold cloth from the chiller, and sat in the wet eucalyptus steam room. \u00a0The temperature here was perfect.\u00a0 Then on to the co-ed relaxation room which was most impressive and proved to enhance the peaceful end to my journey. I refreshed with some pineapple iced water, fruits, chocolates and gummi bears, then settled in under a soft downy comforter blanket, booster pillow for me knees, and my snacks. \u00a0The staff is top notch and very attentive, always inviting me to let them know if there is anything I need. \u00a0Becka and Margo were especially attentive during my visit, offering three kinds of teas and - this is the best part - a heated neck cushion and heated eye pillow. \u00a0After putting those on, I drifted in to a deep state of relaxation and nirvana.... They do a tour every morning and another at 6pm at night that includes a tour of the relaxation room I was in, but Margo let me know ahead of time and I was about to leave. \u00a0Also, the relaxation room can get a bit noisy as therapists come in and out calling out last names of clients waiting for their appointment. The doors kind of slam and people from the hydrotherapy garden also use a different entrance that can create another source of disruption.\u00a0 With a cleansing shower I felt so renewed and rejuvenated. \u00a0It was a wondrous experience.\u00a0 Next time, I will have a treatment too, as the hydrotherapy garden and other amenities are all included with a treatment! The prices for the treatments are on the high side, and there are no Kamaaina discounts, but Disney Vacation Club members I believe are entitled to receive a free service upgrade.\u00a0 All in all a nice experience at Aulani.

It feels a bit crowded in the courtyard and is totally dominated by the theme park type pool, lazy river and volcano water slides. Just not enough garden space. The lobby seems overwhelmed by the hotel wings. The Hyatts, Four Seasons, etc have expansive ocean views when you walk into their entries, this is totally blocked out by the pool and volcano.

Our room looked out onto the day spa area and the adult quiet pool, so it was definietly peacful. No loud noises from bigger pool area. Here are the postitives of the hotel. 1. Very friendly staff. Everywhere we went, the staff said hello, and went out of their way to serve us. 2.Hotel is brand new. There is still one part of a tower not open yet (at least not during Thanksgiving week). No signs of wear and tear. Very clean. 3. Beautifully decorated. stunning, in fact. 4. There is something for every age of child. Water playground (think \"Pirates Cove at Legoland)., 2 water slides (one you use a inner tube), waterfalls, giant swimming pool etc. There is also a teen spa and teen room. We used Aunty's Shack for the kids. Dropped them off at night so that we could have a nice dinner one nite. Kids loved making volcanos. Aunty's Shack services are included in the price (except for special excursions). 5. there's a private beach/lagoon that is shared with the Marriott. You can snorkel, rent paddle boards or just swim out to the rafts and spend the afternoon perfecting your cannonballs like my son did. 6. There's a private \"giant aquarium\" you can snorkel in. Good for the little kids who might be afraid of the real ocean at first. 7. My kids (8 and 10) also loved the manta ray feeding and petting experience. This was extra costs throught the Reef Shop. Negatives: 1. Pricey. the hotel isn't cheap. About the same price as a Ritz Carlton. Better value though, due to the Aunty's Shack included in price and the pool design. 2.

We have annual passes to Disneyland and can see the characters pretty much anytime we want and didn't think Turkey was worth $80. Many guests we talked to were going off property for Thanksgiving dinner. All in all, worth the trip. We'll be back.

We were warmly greeted by Guest Services and our first impression was that we couldn\u2019t believe we were actually seeing what we were seeing. Our rooms were beautiful and comfortable and overlooked the pools and the lagoon. My favourite thing to do every day was to go in the infinity pool and watch the sunset, unfortunately due to safety reasons around the pool area, there was tremendously noisy improvements being done and cement would fly up into the air as they were drilling into the cement from 9-5 each day (except the Weekend). After it was done though it went back to being like being in paradise, you could finally enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the place and enjoy the Hawaiian Music playing around the pool areas, you could hear the birds chirping and just completely relax, but while it was being done it really took away from the magic of the place, it just went on and on relentlessly of a day and it wasn\u2019t fair to paying guests who came from so far and really wanted to enjoy their stay in peace and quiet. My other huge disappointment was that on the day of my birthday it came and went and was completely overlooked by the Resort. I didn\u2019t expect a big song and dance but they knew I was celebrating my birthday there and just a card or a call to say Happy Birthday would have really made my stay. Also my cousin had a lot of trouble getting from Honolulu to the Resort and a taxi going back worked out at over $100 as it proved to be quite hard getting back and forth from Honolulu. I did not ever imagine that my birthday would go overlooked when they knew that was the whole reason for our stay was to celebrate my birthday there. Admittedly, they were very busy with the Apec Summit but it was quite disappointing at the time and they did ensure that on every other day that we were having a good time. The staff are outstanding, especially the VIP Guest Services staff. I cannot recommend this Hotel highly enough to everyone, I just don\u2019t recommend staying for a special occasion because it may be overlooked. It\u2019s so lovely spending your birthday somewhere special and being acknowledged by the Hotel, you then always remember forever your special day fondly when you look back. My parents only requests were that the resort have a nice little coffee shop as they had to keep walking to the nearby Marriott, which was fine, but if it wasnt for that they would never have left as they were so happy where they were and that the beds not be so high from the ground, it was quite hard for them to get up into the bed each night, it was apparantly designed to put the suitcases under the beds but it is too hard for the elderly to get in and out of. The Disney show at the Resort with all the characters was outstanding, it was actually even better than being in Disneyland, because it was more up close and personal with all the favourite Disney characters. I loved staying at the Resort and was actually quite sad to leave, the 8 days went by so fast after looking forward for so long to arriving. I look forward to many more visits to this outstanding Resort in the years to come.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, CA", "Title": "\u201cAwesome time at Aulani!!!\u201d", "Author": "Shuweb", "ReviewID": "UR121206405", "Content": "This is a babymoon. In other words, there won't be a big trip for the next couple of years, and this was a good enough reason to visit Aulani, a new Disney resort that opened in August 2011. This trip report is written as of the Thanksgiving week in which we were at Aulani. You can see the photos from our trip at www.shuweb.com. Aulani is located on the southwestern side of Oahu, in a little \"community\" called Ko Olina. It's a little ways from Waikiki, so for most people, this little gem has remained unknown. But now with Aulani, the main attraction in Oahu has just shifted to Ko Olina. Please note, the resort was still experimenting with schedules, activities, etc., so please check on your own to make sure things don't change when you're there. Day 1 As we arrived in Ko Olina, we passed through a gate with security. I'm not sure whether non-guests of the restaurants/hotels are not allowed, but the security guard had our name on a roster, and we were allowed to proceed. There are two primary hotels here - the JW Marriott Ihilani and Aulani, both of which share a beach in a small lagoon like area. there is also Roy's, which is a very well known restaurant (see also our Oahu trip from the year before), Paradise Cove, which I hear is a very good luau. Upon arrival at Aulani, we were presented our lei (our daughter received a necklace) and were whisked away to be checked in - we were taken to a concierge desk where Teresa took care of our check in, restaurant reservations, gave us the Daily Iwa, and showed us the map of the property. The welcome was very nice - she took all the time we needed to start our stay. We went up to our room 1531, where our luggage arrived. there is free wi-fi here throughout the resort - this would become useful for the occasional iPhone photos. The room was very nicely done - it highlighted Hawaiian culture and crafts as opposed to Disney itself. In fact, the only hint of Disney was a lamp of Mickey. They designed the room well - it was very tastefully done. The only comment I would make is that a partial ocean view could also be a parking structure view - you may be better off getting the pool view on a higher floor. We walked back into the lobby floor, which was beautifully decorated in every direction. There were staff (I mean, cast members) everywhere, all of them very willing to help and share their own wonderful experiences at Aulani. As soon as we walked out to the pool area, we saw Stitch - he was greeting the kids in a Hawaiian shirt. The wait to take pictures with took less than five minutes, which is unheard of at Disneyland. We knew about the nearby grocery store - it is an ABC store - so we walked down the hill and across the street - and found everything from salads made to order, quick take out food and fruits. In the immediate area, there were also an ice cream store, Mexican restaurant, Hawaiian BBQ, etc. Our daughter went to Aunty's Beach House, a kids only club for hotel guests, where she dressed up as Cinderella and did arts and crafts and had a tea party. There are a ton of staff - they were very nice and attentive; on that day, it was 2 staff for every kid when I picked up Cinderella (yes, she was in the costume). I inquired about the cleanliness of the dress - and based on the answer, I was satisfied (let's just say that they go through A LOT of dresses). I then went on to explore the resort - and my wife was happily enjoying the nice hotel room. We had dinner at Makahiki - a buffet. This is one of two restaurants that require reservations, even for breakfast. It's not cheap either - $43 for adults for dinner (and around $25 for adult breakfast). The buffet was not bad, but I didn't feel like I ate my money's worth. After dinner, our daughter went back to the beach house where she apparently dressed up as Snow White and had a blast hanging out. Day 2 On Monday, we had breakfast at Olelo Room, which basically serves a la carte pastries and other carbs and sugar, as well as coffee and tea. The food was OK, but it was not a filling breakfast. By this time, we had resigned to forking out the money for our morning meals. At 9am, we saw fish feeding in the Rainbow Reef, where something like 70 species of fish reside. Our daughter had a terrific time watching the fish (from a window). This \"reef\" is a glorified pool - don't assume that his is a section of the beach where fish come and go. We followed up the morning with photos with Minnie, and an hour later with Mickey. By this time, we had become accustomed to seeing adults (mostly Japanese - I can say that because I am one too) going absolutely nuts for these characters. What's great here is that the wait time is so short, and they take their time with each person. We went into the infinity hot tubs until we were well cooked, because quite frankly, the pool water was way too cold for me (though apparently not too cold for our daughter). The hot tub was therapy - there are two levels of the hot tub, and the hot water overflows from one to the other - so if you sit just beneath the upper tub, you can have the hot water drench you from above - it was like a massage. We had our lunch at poolside (burgers, lettuce wraps), and our daughter went into the Aunty's Beach House, which by at this time was her favorite place to be. Then, my wife and daughter did the sting ray experience (there are up to 3 sessions per day - ours was 2pm). This was a one of a kind experience. I didn't join in the fun, but I took photos and listened to the instructors. We learned about sting rays - and in case you're curious, they remove the barbs, which are like finger nails and they grow right back. The participants got to touch them and feed them, all while the professional photographer took pictures (they have Photo Pass here too). After the experience, my wife and daughter went into a quieter, smaller pool as I looked on a wedding in which Mickey and Minnie were the hosts. On this night, we decided to have prepared dinner from the grocery store -we had to be there early for Starlit Hui (7pm, Mondays and Thursdays only, so book your trip accordingly!). We quickly grabbed our seat on the mat floor (no chairs) and secured our spot, and looked around the several Hawaiian crafts activities which they made available to people to participate. The dancers also gave ad hoc dance lessons to the little kids. The official show started way past 7pm - maybe it was closer to 7:30. The show itself was wonderful - there were beautiful hula dances to some great singing, fast paced ukelele by the duo Heart & Soul, some traditional Hawaiian music, and lots of kid participation. This part of the show must have only lasted maybe 45 minutes, but it was terrific - dare I say better than Ha at the Polynesian Cultural Center? But the real fun started when the characters came - Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Stitch, Chip & Dale - in a big dance party where kids and grown ups alike were shaking their booty and line dancing. The show ended with more character photo ops, and it was all done by around 8:30. Day 3 On early Tuesday morning, we had breakfast at Ama Ama (yes, reservation required - you can book it online) - it was a wonderful buffet, including Mickey Mouse waffles. This was apparently a trial period - they will go a la carte in December, but I hope they go back to buffet again. They had very nice service - food is $25 per head adults, $12 kids - and very worth it. They were extremely attentive and the food was very good - all with the beach as our background. The activity for the morning was the Hoku Nai'a dolphin watch. Basically, a bus took us out to the marina, and from there we traveled north by large boat along the west coast, all the way to where the road ended. There, along the beach, the dolphins were spotted spinning and jumping - in fact, they came up to our boat and swam with us. By law, we were only allowed to stay there for half an hour, as dolphins hunt at night and we were to not keep them up past their \"bed time.\" This was a great way to see dolphins up close in their natural habitat. We also learned a few miscellaneous things - the wet season starts in November and ends in April - we had caught the early wet season, which may explain the strong breezes in the afternoon (strong enough to wear a light jacket or at least long pants), but the west side of the island remained dry, at least for now. We spent the afternoon taking photos back at the resort with Donald and Goofy, playing in the pool and hot tub (how do kids do it - our daughter went into the cold pool, jumped in the hot tub and back into the cold pool again, only to repeat this over and over), and having shaved ice on the pool side (note: to keep unwanted guests, you must check in to receive your wrist band for the day. They check your name off using your card key, and make sure that you have not already checked in. And if you want your badge of honor, you keep those wrist bands on day after day, and by the end of the trip, you'll have a rainbow of wrist bands. But why people, why? Anyway, the check in is conveniently located next to the fresh towels. Also - the free water stations are a great idea). Our daughter went running back to Aunty's Beach House once more until dinner, where she (now Snow White), Sleeping Beauty (another little girl), and other princesses learned the hula. We as parents went back to the room to watch TV and play Angry Birds because we were already tired... how pathetic. Our night ended with a nice dinner at Ama Ama. The dinner was very nice - but frankly, it didn't quite seem special. The service was great, the food came fast and it was all delicious, but as we compared it to Roy's (see Day 4), it wasn't the same. Nonetheless, we had a good dinner. Day 4 On this day, we had the character breakfast. An important thing to note is that they only have this event on Wednesdays and weekends, and reservations are required way ahead of time (we booked our breakfast a month ahead). Of course, by this time, we had greeted just about all the characters (I'm sorry to report, no princesses in swimsuits). We first checked in at the Makahiki, and were taken to an outside spot where Mickey greeted us for a group photo. Once that was done, we were seated for our breakfast. Only Minnie and Goofy were making their rounds, but it seemed just fine - Aunty kept the crowd going with lots of songs, interaction with the kids, etc., including Aunty and Minnie parading around the restaurant with kids marching in unison (our daughter was proudly hopping around right behind Minnie). Needless to say, our daughter spent more time with the characters or sitting restlessly waiting for the characters to come than she did eating. By the time Minnie and Goofy came to our table, it was nearly an hour into breakfast, but it didn't matter - she had lots of quality time with the gang. With breakfast done, our daughter went back to the Beach House to make Stitch's space goo, and we the parents had some quiet time until lunch. When we picked her up, she was Ariel (apparently a new costume for the house). I spent the early part of the afternoon on the beach with our daughter - so much for making sand castles, we were swimming in the waveless, clear water, as sand colored fish swam at our feet. We finished off with another soaking in the hot tub. Our daughter sprinted back to Aunty's Beach House, and we took our walk to Roy's across the street in the country club. For an adults only dinner. As with our previous experiences, Roy's was fantastic. Day 5 By this time, we felt like we did all that there was. The Rainbow Reef would have been great, but the water is so cold that I could not justify paying money to swim with fish - I've snorkeled in the open waters enough times. Plus, our daughter was more interested in playing with other kids. And so our daughter went to Aunty's again and we signed up for a premium event for her - some kind of magic show party - which lasted a few hours. My wife and I hung out on the pool just outside the frozen yogurt place and had our lunch there, and later I went on the lazy river and then onto the water slides. The slides are pretty fun - I've noticed that smaller, lighter people tend to wipe out at the end of the tube slide, but the life guards will be there to jump right in for you. Our dinner on this Thanksgiving night was at the adjacent Ihilani (a JW Marriott hotel). We ended up here because the two restaurants in Aulani were fully booked and we really didn't have much choice. We walked over to eat at Naupaka Terrace, a casual buffet dining place. The hotel itself did not compare - they had a small pool with hammerhead sharks in it, but that was about it. The guests at Aulani have it real good. It didn't take long to figure that Naupaka Terrace was an out of control zoo - crowded, loud, lousy service and not so exciting food. At least we were back in our hotel room early enough for our return to Starlit Hui. The show was again very good (different Uncle this time), but the fun was all the same. Our daughter participated in all the Keiki dances, and when the characters came out, she was out in front dancing away with them. This was a great way to spend our last evening at Aulani. Day 6 We had our last breakfast at Ama Ama; we'll have had our Mickey Mouse waffles for a while. Our daughter went to Aunty's Beach House for a final morning of fun, and with one last photo op with Donald Duck, we were off to the airport.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cupertino, CA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful, fun hotel \u2014\u00a0food needs work\u201d", "Author": "kateapple", "ReviewID": "UR121184398", "Content": "Our family stayed at the Aulani over Thanksgiving vacation for a week.

The hotel had only been open for one month at that point, so we were prepared for some hiccups during our stay. First off, the hotel is very impressive looking and the view from our room was absolutely gorgeous. The rooms looked like they had never been used before, and I'd be willing to bet they hadn't. There were so many activities to choose from everyday including water slides, a lazy river, toddler play area, day spa, snorkel reef, and more. Our 4 and 6 year old daughters loved the daily pool party with the characters, where they played water games with Mickey and Goofy. The hotel runs much like the Disney Cruise with a schedule of events everyday. It lists the times and locations that you can meet and take pictures with the characters and also the family activities that are available that day. Some of the nightly events we experienced were movies under the stars, and a very entertaining hula show that ended with a character dance party. Despite all the activities available, our daughters begged to spend time everyday at Aunty's Beach House, the kid's club. It was such a cool place for kids. I don't normally leave my children in kid clubs, but Disney always puts a lot of forethought into keeping kids are safe and entertained. As for adult entertainment, I feel that this resort comes up short. In the evening when the kids were in the kids club we actually got bored with nothing to do. On two occasions we went to the day spa, which was very relaxing, but it was co-ed and outdoors with hotel rooms overlooking it. It just didn't have the same atmosphere as other spas I've been to, so we weren't very impressed. The service there was amazing and helped us overlook the shortcomings. The biggest problem that we faced during our stay was dining. There are only 2 restaurants, a take out place, and poolside dining. The restaurants require reservations and were always booked up, so it left us with nowhere to eat on several occasions. When we did eat at the restaurants, the food left a lot to be desired. The menu choices were very limited, especially for children, which is crazy considering we were at a Disney resort. We finally discovered a restaurant across the street and a little market where we could get breakfast. We definitely enjoyed our stay, but I doubt we'll go back anytime soon.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deltona Fllorida, USA", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort, with a few caveats\u201d", "Author": "bruehlt", "ReviewID": "UR120940364", "Content": "We used DVC points to book this resort for our honeymoon. This is essentially a brand new resort on Oahu, and it shows. The resort itself is amazing! The pool / spa area is beautiful, the rooms are clean, and up to date with the latest technology. The service is to be expected at Disney - first class. There are a few things to be aware of (not show stoppers). Signage to this location is severely lacking. The GPS we used didn't have the location listed since it was so new, so we drove to where we saw it (you can't miss it, its huge). We had a very difficult time finding the entrance to the place, the sign is small, and very easy to miss. Signs appear to be lacking in quite a few areas of the resort as well. They were not very clear as to where to go for a quick breakfast (versus the seated meal), as well as the froyo shop (its located right next to the day spa, but there aren't any signs telling you that its there). Disney really needs to fix the signs. As for the rooms - one other thing that should have been designed better were the water closet rooms. The bathroom is divided into the toilet (water closet), and shower / sink via a sliding pocket door. The door offers no privacy to anyone that is using the water closet since it has angled slats in the door (similar to a changing room door). This is not a good design by any means, especially considering the confined quarters of the rooms... Finally, in regards to the service. When we first arrived, I'm not sure if it was a slow day or what, but we were swarmed by valet and bell services. They didn't really give us the option of allowing us to just check in and unload our luggage ourselves. They immediately wrote up valet / bell services slips and told us to come back once we were checked in. They took our car to valet parking, which really didn't make any sense since it only took 10-15 min to check in. We came back, and our car was gone, they had to go get it.

We had a small refrigerator, microwave and sink with bar area. Table for 4 came in handy. One and a half bathrooms. The bathroom suite had walk in shower with full handicap accessibility, double sink, bidet and whirlpool tub. The robes in the room were the most comfortable, in fact the room came with two but we asked for two more so all of us could wear one. The hotel is new but housekeeping did a great job keeping everything clean while we were there. Each evening housekeeping turned down the beds and left a brochure of events for the next day (like a cruise ship). The hospitality by most employees were top notch.

The hotel is dark (need more sunlight, but that is not going to happen). I guess with all the times I go to Hawaii and different hotels I stay, I've gotten so I like the Bright/happy feeling and experience of most hotels there. The room is not large and also dark. The deck was ok for 2 people to sit and relax. I was in room 621, this overlooked the parking garage. Go for a higher floor and you may see the golf course and mountain better. If you are wanting to pay for the ocean view, you will see the river pool and lagoon/ocean. Here again you'll need higher floor to see over \"their\" man made mountain. Stitch was Disney character walking around the grounds for pic ops. they will take pic where you take their card to gift shop to view and buy them. They also will take a pic with your camera/cell phone. If we had our grandkids we would have probably done the character buffet breakfast, but instead drove the 10 minutes into Kapolei to Zippy's (If Denny's Restaurant is a 5 on scale to 10, Zippy's would be a 7 - good food/price/family friendly). This hotel area (and there are a few) is a short walk to Paradise Cove Luau, which is one of the better luaus and it's a plus to be close to your room when the show is over at night (no long drive); you are 10 minutes from Kapolei (the 2nd city) with theatre,fast food/restaurants,safeway,target,etc. 30 minutes from the airport and hour from Waikiki. Close to lots of golf courses. If you're going to Polenisia (sp?) Culteral center - you'll have a long drive from just about anywhere, but it is worth it (you'll spend the whole day until end of show (9pm? can't remember but you'll get back late).

I do realize the hotel has only partially opened at this point and they are still working out the kinks. The good things...the hotel was not full and they upgraded us for our entire visit to a poolside room! ALL the staff were fully engaged and very friendly to us. My favorite part...the jacuzzi facing the Ko'Olina lagoon- great place to watch the sunsets. The rooms were great...we had 2 queens. The room does contain a refrigerator but not microwave. I did call and ask if a microwave was available somewhere on site and they offered to bring one to the room for FREE. It was delivered in 5 minutes and we were able to keep it until we checked out. The studios do contain a microwave but our room was a standard room. The other wonderful thing was that they approved a late check out for us since our flight didn't leave until 11pm that night. We also took advantage of the lounge that is available for this specific situation. We put a change of clothes in a locker in the lounge was able to enjoy the pool the entire day. We then were able to take showers and get ready for our flight later on that day after we had already checked out of our room. Now for the bumps...the food service needs lots of improvements: Ama Ama- expensive, menu hard to decifer (had to ask the waiter lots of questions about the menu items before ordering) and my entree (Island Seafood Stew) was not cooked well enough). When I brought this to the waiters attention he credited our bill and apologized. The waiter was exceptional as our son fell asleep during dinner. He found a blanket for him as we pushed two chairs together so he could sleep while we finished dinner. The other suggestion is that I was really wanting more quick service meal options, especially entree type salads. The only substantial salad you can get at this point is at Ama Ama. The other thing is that there is only a buffet option for breakfast at this point. The cast members stated that Ama Ama would be opening up for breakfast in the next couple of days. Still I wonder if there is going to be a economical option for breakfast (maybe open One Paddle Two Paddle earlier with breakfast items- ie: yogurt parfaits, muffins, grab and go breakfast like Starbucks has). The other bump which is minor is the armbands for the pool...I can't tell you how many times we scratched our son (on mistake) by picking him up and the armband scratching him. Other than that the hotel was great and we hopefully will be returning in we can save enough for another stay.", "Date": "November 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMagical Disney Resort\u201d", "Author": "3keikis", "ReviewID": "UR120553791", "Content": "My family of 5 stayed at Aulani for 3 nights and we were impressed with the friendly ohana feel all the staff provides the guests.

To place my review of Disney\u2019s Aulani in perspective, let me first say that over the years, we have been to every island and many resorts, including the Hyatt Resort Poipu and Westin Princeville on Kauai; Four Seasons (both properties) on Lanai; Grand Wailea, Ritz Carlton Kapalua, Four Seasons, Honua Kai and Hyatt Kanapali on Maui; Hilton Hawaiian Village, The Orchid and Mauna Lani on Hawaii (Big Island); Hyatt Waikiki and Outrigger on Oahu. The Aulani is probably the resort we will keep coming back to over the next several years \u2013 and not because we bought a timeshare, but because we just had one of the best vacations ever, thanks to an amazing, unique Disney resort! One caveat \u2013 we visited while Aulani had only been open for about 2 \u00bd months and while the service and facilities were reminiscent of an established resort open for years, the crowds were not, which is one reason we enjoyed our stay so much! Visiting during the peak season or once the hotel/timeshares are 100% open may render a different experience. For now, enjoy this well kept secret gem. When we visited the last week of October 2011, the resort was only 30% \u201copen\u201d with hotel/timeshare rooms and of the 30%, they were only 80% occupancy. Not a ghost town, just perfect, so I caution about the experience once the resort is fully open. This is very much a family resort, and probably best with younger kids. While they have a teen program, I\u2019m not sure teens will enjoy as much as the younger crowd. We saw a few couples without kids and I\u2019m not sure why they were here with so many other wonderful choices for adults in Hawaii. Disney is definitely trying to appeal to all ages, but I am still convinced Aulani is best for families with kids. There is a \"tween\" spa and plenty of \"tween\" offerings, but I can't speak first-hand on this age group. When we arrived at the gated entrance to Ko Olina, we were cheerfully greeted and the guard even acknowledged it was my son\u2019s birthday. Upon entering the beautiful Aulani entrance a minute later, there were several Disney staff people who welcomed us by name and with fresh leis, chilled pineapple infused water and unloaded our car. Note: in hindsight, a car is unnecessary unless you\u2019ve never been to Oahu before and you intend to explore. Aulani is 20 min from the airport and at $35/day for parking, a car is not necessary. There is an onsite rental for daytrips. Our room was ready and we were allowed to check in early, about 10am! The first half of our week stay was in a standard \u201cpool\u201d view hotel room then we stayed in a 1 BR timeshare villa. We are not DVC owners, but based on availability, the villas can be booked by anyone, but the villa was only available for part of our stay. The standard room was beautiful, modern and very well appointed \u2013 up there with any 5 star hotel. Bathrooms were nicer than our recent stays at Four Seasons! The balcony was spacious and had a great pool view. With 2 small kids, I don\u2019t love staying in a standard room, but it was all we could book at the time. Later, when we checked into the 1BR, we were in heaven. If they\u2019re available, and you can afford the extra expense, it is well worth the price! Regular kitchen, washer/dryer, huge living room, balconies, bedroom, absolutely perfect! The timeshares and hotel rooms are well mixed, so no one feels isolated for being in one versus the other like some mixed-use resorts. The common areas are immaculate and beautiful \u2013 much better than any picture I saw on the Aulani website. 100% better in person. Even if you are not staying here, if you are in the area, the hotel is worth touring. The pool and water areas are awesome with many choices and things to explore. There is a lazy river that is very \u201cDisney\u201d in terms of setting and surprises \u2013 enjoyable for all ages and only 3\u2019 deep, so safe for elementary kids to explore. There is also a large water structure area that is a fun play area for the younger kids offering mini water slides and lots of splashing & play opportunities in shallow 6\u201d water. Two water slides (one with tubes and one without) are the focal point of the water area. Kudos to Disney for not restricting heights on these slides when every other resort would! Even babies can go when accompanied by an adult! The slides were a blast and while not as long as ones you will find at exclusive water parks, they are fun and better than other resorts we\u2019ve visited. We never experienced a wait once during our stay, but when the hotel gets busy, it will be very annoying to wait in long lines for the slides. Slides and lazy river are open late \u2013 until 8pm with staffed lifeguards everywhere. The main pool, adult pool and several jacuzzi\u2019s are also enjoyable, especially the 2 vanishing edge jacuzzi\u2019s overlooking the beautiful beach. Onsite there is also a beautiful manmade snorkeling lagoon that feels very natural \u2013 you can rent gear and snorkel in a protected environment that has a TON of beautiful color fish. There is also a viewing area for non-participants. In addition, there is a Stingray experience that is quite reasonably priced for Hawaii. For about $50, you get 30 min to get in the water with the rays, feed them, etc \u2013 it\u2019s amazing and my 5 year old loved it. The pool area requires a wristband \u2013 I found this a little obnoxious, but I understand why it\u2019s necessary. I had my kids wear one and I didn\u2019t and as long as I was with them, there was no problem. It was nice to see security escort some \u201ccrashers\u201d away from the pool area on several occasions. Throughout the day, there are a ton of activities, more than a family could possibly do in a day. Activities are organized by age groups: family, family with little kids, couples, and teens. Don\u2019t miss the \u201cShaka Shaka Pool Party\u201d with the Disney characters who get into the water and facilitate games and a mini show. Speaking of characters, meet & greets are offered with 8 different Disney friends throughout the week with at least 2-3 each day. The characters allow enough time for plenty of pictures and \u201cface\u201d time \u2013 we were very impressed, so much better than theme park opportunities! No more than a 2-3 minute wait for us, but could change as resort becomes busier. Don\u2019t miss the evening show \u201cStarlit Hui\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s offered twice a week and free for resort guests \u2013 go here for free instead of expensive luau\u2019s \u2013 you won\u2019t be disappointed! Aunty\u2019s House is amazing and for kids 3+ (and toilet trained), its unlimited access from appx 9am-9pm. You can drop off your kids (FREE!) and they are entertained with amazing structured activities \u2013 games, crafts, etc by energetic, happy Disney childcare staff. There is also a game room for every video game imaginable. I had to drag my 5 yr old away from Aunty\u2019s. Throughout the day there are also special activities offered, but 90% of them are free and fabulous. No reservations were necessary, entirely drop-in. Don\u2019t miss the secret Menehune Trail. Guests can leave a room key in exchange for an iPhone type transponder to tour the property and discover secret interactive attractions. It takes close to an hour and will amaze you \u2013 much thought and planning went into this one-of-a-kind attraction. Fun for all ages and absolutely amazing. The resort is a mix of hotel and timeshares, but it feels like only a hotel. We were never pressured or contacted to visit the timeshare. The timeshare rooms and hotel rooms are mixed together so everyone is close to all facilities. We loved our timeshare room \u2013 much larger, but I assume these will be harder to rent for non-DVC members as Aulani becomes more popular. I only have 2 complaints about Aulani: 1) lack of restaurant and food options and 2) photographers. Regarding the restaurants, yes, the prices are high, but no different than other resort prices in the islands, so this is not my complaint as much as the lack of options and variety. There are only 2 main restaurants and a couple quick serve options. For lunch especially, the menu options poolside and all 3 quick-serve options are identical. There is a mini market in the hotel, but it offers more Disney merchandise than food options. Very surprisingly, you can\u2019t get anything that is not pre-made and the pre-made items are the exact same things available at the \u201cLava Shack\u201d by the pool - seems like Aulani should at least have a make-to-order deli, or better grocery options. There is a convenience ABC market across the street but it\u2019s a mini-mart \u2013 not a grocery store by any stretch, however, it offers more variety compared to what you will find at Aulani. Surprisingly, Ko Olina does not offer many options either. There is a Roy\u2019s across the street and a couple quick options (Hawaiian and Mexican), but nothing we considered great by Hawaii fine dining standards. Even Azul next door at the JW Marriott was a step above average (but great compared to \u2018Ama \u2018Ama at Aulani). As for \u2018Ama \u2018Ama, it was pricey and the food was average. For good food, the prices are fine, but $40/entr\u00e9e and the food should be great, and it wasn\u2019t for our dinner. One exception - if you are into characters, don\u2019t miss the character breakfast at Makahiki \u2013 it\u2019s worth the cost. I thought the food was good, a bit cultural and gourmet, but nice quality. Book an early reservation (before 8am) because you will have better seating options \u2013 highly recommend outside. The entertainment is constant and fabulous all morning, but it gets very crowded with the locals coming for the special brunch. The Disney photographers were my only other issue. The free candid photos with the photo pass people were Ok if you were willing to buy their expensive photos later on-line. Separately, we booked and paid for a private photo session with a professional Disney photographer which was a disaster. Photographer showed up late, had broken equipment, wasn\u2019t good with kids, pictures were too dark, not enough beach shots and the list goes on. They did refund our money, but we don\u2019t have photos for our Christmas cards because Disney had so many issues with the private photo session. Hopefully they\u2019ll get this fixed because it would have been nice to have pro photos on the beach! In summary, Aulani is our new favorite Hawaii vacation spot. We would normally never visit the \u201cmain\u201d island (Maui or Kauai instead), but Aulani is a reason for us to go to Oahu \u2013 at least until the place becomes too busy like Disneyworld or Disneyland! So easy (and cheaper) to get to Honolulu than other Hawaiian islands and Aulani is a very special place to visit with family!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gales Ferry, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cHeaven can wait.\u201d", "Author": "scorpiondiver62", "ReviewID": "UR120440133", "Content": "When you visit Aulani, Heaven can wait awhile.

My wife and I were traveling with our two young children (Girl and Boy ages 3 1/2 and 21 months). After touching down in Honolulu, we picked up our rental car and drove to Aulani. It took us maybe 25-30 minutes to get there from Honolulu. When we arrived, we were greeted by a handful of friendly staff and presented with Leis and fruit-infused water. Parking is $35/night whether you choose valet or self-park (self parking is free for DVC members). The bellman took all our luggage while a cast member walked us into the BEAUTIFUL lobby and gave us a little history of Hawaii and reasoning behind some of the different areas and images in the lobby. The people at the check-in desk couldn't have been nicer either. Each member of your party including kids gets a room card with your name on it. You have the option of linking one of your credit cards to the room card, which is very nice as any charges you make at the resort (dinner, gift shop, snacks, etc) you only need to have your room card and ID with. No need to carry around your credit card. You can choose whether or not you want your kids' cards to be able to have the ability to charge to your card or not. We had a room on the 5th floor of the West tower. Our room we booked was a Poolside Gardens View Room, which I highly recommend. The room had a very nice bathroom, two beds, mini-fridge, table and chairs, and balcony overlooking the pool and gardens. You could even see the ocean from the balcony as well. It was pretty late so we gave ourselves a quick mini-tour of the pool and gardens area. There is a lazy river (tubes are provided free of charge - both single and double), two waterslides (one tube slide and one enclosed body slide), a kids play area with bridge, slides, water dropping all over the place, etc, two pools (one of them adults only), and I believe 3 hot tubs. The best hot tub is an infinity hot tub just behind the main pool - we watched at least 4 or 5 sunsets from this one. There also is the beach/lagoon area which is just down the stairs from the infinity hot tub. Lounge chairs are free for Disney guests, but you'll pay about $30-$40/day for a covered double chair/lounge. Each morning began around 8 or 9am and breakfast was the first thing on everyone's mind, obviously. So let's talk about food options. Inside the resort, for breakfast you can choose Private Dining (AKA room service), The Olelo Room (Continental buffet with rolls, yogurt parfaits, etc), or Makahiki (Character breakfasts are by reservation only and are only on Sat, Sun, and Wed). We tried each one, and here are our thoughts: 1. Room service was insanely expensive, as expected. We had two kids portions of 3 pancakes and 2 stuffed french toast, and an adult variety platter of roll, muffins, parfait, milk and juice. With the delivery charge and automatic gratuity, it was about $50. We did this only one morning. 2. The Olelo room we visited twice. This is on Level 1 (pool floor), just next to Makahiki. Parfaits are $6.50, Muffins and Croissants around $4, etc. We spent maybe $20-$30 here each of the two mornings we ate there. 3. Makahiki had buffet style dining most days and the Disney Character Breakfast on Saturdays, Sundays and Wednesdays. We did not try the normal breakfast buffet. When we arrived, after checking in, we asked Concierge about the possibility of them getting us a reservation for the Character Breakfast (I had tried online unsuccessfully a week before - it said all times were booked). They were able to get us a reservation for Saturday morning. They start by taking your picture with Mickey which the waiter will offer you for $32. The buffet was very good, and not counting the picture, we paid about $80-$90 for our family of four. Other characters there included Minnie Mouse and Goofy, who stopped by our table at least once or twice. Auntie leads the kids in songs which was fun. The other mornings we ate food that was purchased from the nearby ABC store/market, which is a quick walk (5 min max) just outside the resort. In the shopping center they have the ABC store, an ice cream/panini shop, a Hawaiian BBQ joint, Mexican cantina/bar, and more. When we go back next time, we'll probably do the majority of our breakfasts (and probably some lunches and dinners) in our room with food purchased from ABC store. An even cheaper alternative would be to drive 10 min into Kapolei and pick up items from the Target or Kmart there. Kmart also has a Little Caesars just inside the entrance where Large cheese or pepperoni pizzas are $7. Lunch and dinner options included One Paddle/Two Paddle, Ama Ama, and the poolside dining option right next door, which I believe was called Off the Hook. One Paddle/Two Paddle had a walk up window where you ordered. Kids meals were $6.95 and adult meals around $13. Kids meals include a drink and fruit or fries. Off the Hook has a better selection of kids meals for the same price. Ama Ama is their formal restaurant with great sunset views. It is an open-air restaurant and we paid around $85 for our dinner the one night we ate there. The waitress was extremely nice and took a couple photos of us just as the sun was setting. You can also order food or drinks poolside from a waiter/waitress. Beverages: I highly recommend going into The Surf Shack (small store just by the pool) or Kalepas (gift shop in the lobby hallway) as soon as you arrive and buying refillable soda/hot chocolate mug for $18.99. You can get free refills for the length of your stay. There is a beverage station in Kalepas and just outside the Surf Shack. One Paddle/Two Paddle is where we got the hot chocolate filled up, but they also have a beverage station there as well. There are a few places to grab an alcoholic drink. One Paddle/Two Paddle serves beer, as well as the walk up bar by Off the Hook. The Olelo room is a cool joint open for drinks from 5pm-11pm and features a lot of Hawaiian artifacts/pieces on shelves on the wall. There is also a walk up bar outside the main adult pool, but we did not check this one out. Treats: There is a Shave Ice stand just next to the pool where you can get a variety of flavors for $3.75. There is also a yogurt stand inside the spa in the teen area. We did not go here so I can't review it Back to the trip and details of the resort: Each day you'll need to stop by the towel shack (next to the main pool) and show your room cards to get a bracelet for the day. Each day the color of bracelet changes. Disney does this to prevent all the people who aren't staying there, but rather just perusing the grounds and resort, from using the pools, hot tub, slides, etc. The main pool is really neat as one of the entrances begins with 1 inch of water and slowly progresses deeper - maybe 3 1/2 feet max. Great spot where the kids loved hanging out. They have lifejackets for kids available at no charge in a big plastic box by the main pool. They do require younger children who aren't potty trained to wear Little Swimmers. If you forget to bring some with you like we did, I'd recommend buying a pack of them at Target or you'll pay $3/each at Surf Shack. The slides were cool - our daughter loved the tube slide - I took the double tube to ride with her. The slide finished with us ending up in the lazy river. The other slide is a body slide and enclosed, so it is very dark and younger kids may not care for it. It, however, is much faster. Usually there was hardly any wait for the tube slide, but we maybe waited at most 10 minutes one afternoon. We only went in the infinity hot tub, which has two levels. It was amazing and never too crowded which I was surprised by. The beach area was very nice. The resort backs up to one of the 5 lagoons in the area, so it is safe swimming and snorkeling as it is protected for the most part from the ocean. Visitors have access to the beach, but it never seemed very crowded. I watched a beautiful sunrise here one morning. Definitely worth waking up early for. You can also rent various beach equipment at a shack by the beach. Snorkeling. There are two spots to snorkel at the resort. Snorkeling gear can be rented for $20 for one day or $40 for length-of-stay. I chose the latter option and first snorkeled in Rainbow Reef, which is the man made reef to the west of the main pool. Some great fish and there is a cool viewing window where my kids were able to watch the fish and wave hi to me as I snorkeled. You can also snorkel out in the lagoon. I definitely didn't see as pretty of fish, but if you stay close to the rocks, you'll see a gorgeous one from time to time. If you buy the snorkeling pass for the length of your stay, they punch your bracelet and you can just show them this to get your gear down at the beach if you wish to snorkel in the lagoon. Characters: How could I forget? This is a Disney Resort, after all! Each day you'll get a copy of the agenda for the following day - it is a 4 page packet/brochure called the Daily 'Ewa, I believe. On the front cover it will list what characters are appearing and at what times they will be out. They always meet at the same spot - outside on the pool level just as you exit the doors near the Makahiki/Olelo Room. You can bring your camera, and of course Disney staff has a photographer there as well taking photos and they'll give you a Photo Pass card where you can order pictures online if you choose. While we were there, they had the following characters appear at meet and greet: Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald Duck, Chip and Dale, and Stitch. Spa: Supposedly the Laniwai Spa is amazing, but we didn't have any services performed here. We stopped in - it is located on Level 1 of the West tower just before you go outside. 50 min massages are around $150-$160 and they have a plethora of other things to choose from. Also a 5,000 square foot outdoor aromatherapy garden area seemed enticing, but we decided to spend our money elsewhere. Daycare/Activity area: This is called Aunty's Beach House and is free (meals are provided for an additional charge if you wish to leave your kids here and be gone for the whole day, say at Pearl Harbor or something). It is free and open to kids ages 3 and up who are potty trained. Hours typically are 8 or 9am until 9pm, and I think they stayed open till 11pm on weekend nights. Inside they have a cool play area with all the Disney Princess dresses for girls, video games for older kids, and more. If you wish your child to stay without you, you'll need to fill out an application. Otherwise you can accompany them in there at any time. We went one morning for an activity called \"Stitch's Space Goo\" and this was really fun - kids got to see Stitch and make Space Goo. Aunty's also has a cool backyard area with two playsets. One afternoon we went there as an activity was listed in the Daily 'Ewa and it turned out there was only one other child there, and Chip and Dale showed up to have a surfing party. That was pretty fun for our kids. Other activities for kids: They have a pool party in the main pool I think twice a week where Mickey, Minnie, and Goofy show up to and then take pictures afterwards. There is also an Aloha Beach Party on the deck area outside the Rainbow Reef where Chip and Dale showed up. These were at 1:30 and 4:30 in the afternoons. They also have a neat interactive game you can borrow from the Pau Hana Room (sp?) where they give you a phone and you have a video interaction with Aunty and she directs you certain places in the resort where hidden images will pop up, photo frames come to life, etc. Our little guy made it through about 10 minutes before he was ready to move, so I may only recommend it if you don't have the kids or have older kids. Other family activities: There is a cool firepit to the east of the main pool just below Ama Ama where they have storytelling every night. A man named \"Uncle\" tells stories by the fire. They usually had this at 7, 9, and 9:45pm. Our little guy wasn't too keen on staying still for a long period of time, so we didn't check this out. They have an amazing show called the Starlit Hui twice or three times each week at 7pm on the garden area to the west of the main pool, just behind the adult pool. For the first half hour or so they have a lot of activities for kids and hula dancers walk around and offer to teach your kids the hula if they want. They give you a big mat for your family to sit and watch the show of singing and dancing which starts around 7:30 or 7:45. The characters come and take pictures afterwards with everyone. We only left the resort for the day two days, and other than grabbing food if you wish at ABC store or someplace similar, you really don't need to. One day we drove north to the Dole Plantation which had a cool train ride for the kids and some amazing pineapple ice cream! We also went into Honolulu to Hilo Hattie to get matching Hawaiian outfits for a family picture. The other day we drove to Pali lookout for amazing views of the city and ocean, and followed it up with lunch at a local burger joint recommended by the valet guys. The last night we were there we walked 10 min down the road to Paradise Cove for their Luau. We purchased tickets at the Disney resort and there were different packages ranging from $70 to $130 depending on how close you wanted to sit, how many drinks you wanted, etc. The top tiered package included table service as well, which was nice to not have to drag the kids in the buffet line. Prior to the Luau, they had a variety of activities - canoe ride in the lagoon, posing for pictures with exotic parrots (we paid $20 for 5 or 6 photos), etc. Staff: Everyone was SO friendly, helpful, and nice. After all, you are paying at least $400 a night to stay here, so you'd expect it, but they went above and beyond. From the room service ladies, to the lifeguards and people they just have stationed in the lobby as you walk by, you really felt at home. Lobby: Beautiful open air lobby with hallways with arched super-high ceilings and amazing artwork. They have plenty of places to sit. On our last day, our flight wasn't till 9pm so they let us have a late checkout of 1pm. We then proceeded to drive around the North Shore of the island for some great ocean views and sights. I am probably forgetting some things, but I hope this gives you the info you need to definitely book your vacation here! We will be back for sure next year, most likely to renew our vows for our 10th anniversary. They have wedding services available - we probably saw 2-3 weddings. The only thing I am slightly concerned about is the amount of traffic the resort may see when all the towers and rooms are opened. They are scheduled to open the next phase in November this year, and another phase in March 2012. When we were there, it never seemed too busy or crowded, just am not sure how it will be when we go next year. Sure food was expensive at the resort, but that is to be expected and really wasn't a big deal. It was the first vacation where we didn't have an agenda any day - we just kind of did what we wanted. It was truly relaxing and the best vacation we have ever taken. Thank you Disney for opening this resort. We will be back soon, maybe as DVC members next time.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAmazing\u201d", "Author": "matty3471", "ReviewID": "UR120139707", "Content": "Went here for our honeymoon.

When we arrived, we were immediately greeted with Hawaiian leis and were told about some of the meaning behind the images and decor of the lobby. Check in was quick. We were pleased that the entire hotel, pool and beach had free wi-fi, unlike the Disney World resorts which we frequent with our DVC member parents. Our Room We chose a 'standard' view studio room with 2 queen beds. We were on the 4th floor facing the mountains and parking garage. We didn't even notice the parking garage since it was so well disguised by the lush green vegetation. The higher up you go, I'm sure the garage is more noticeable. The beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean. The glass sliding door is very thick, so we couldn't hear any outside noise when it was closed. Facing North provided us with a nice breeze. Activities: There is something for everyone, adults through small children. We took our 2 1/2 year old and he loved going to Auntie's Beach House. We had to literally drag him out of there each time we went! He did fun activities like making 'Stitch's Space Goo', playing with toys, watching movies, singing, dancing, playing instruments....they have so much to list. The only down side is that we couldn't drop him off since children need to be at least 3 years old. Otherwise parents have to accompany the child. There were a couple high energy kid activities in and by the pool each day and evening fire pit story telling. Again our 2 1/2 year old loved the high energy stuff since he's a high energy kind of kid! We enjoyed the quick Character Meet & Greets, but were disappointed that we only got to see Donald Duck once. Chip & Dale and Stitch seem to be the popular ones at Aulani. Amazing pools, hot tubs, lazy river, minihuni splash area and water slides. Nicely done Disney! I don't think it could have been done any better to suit such a wide age range. Aulani is situated on a lovely crescent shaped beach that is shared with the Marriott. It never got crowded and we were always able to find a lounge chair. If you want an umbrella, it's $15 for 4 hours. Totally worth it. Snorkeling was nice. The water was warm and crystal clear so you can see some beautiful fish but don't expect a magnificent reef. There aren't a lot of fish, so you have to be patient to find them, but I was able to find convict tang, reef triggerfish, a school of large beautiful blue and yellow fish and some other smaller colorful fish. You can rent a paddle board or kayak if that's your thing. Food For quick dining and poolside dining, the food is good, but there isn't a wide selection. By the third day, I was ready for something new. Shaved ice. Yummy snack. There was frozen yogurt somewhere inside, but we never ventured in to get it. The character breakfast at Makahiki was good, but again, not a huge selection if you are used to the character breakfasts at Cape May in Disney World. They had the basics: french toast, pancakes, Mickey waffles, several kinds of eggs, bacon, sausage, fried rice, fish, meat carver, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, rice, and a few other things I can't remember off the top of my head. We got a picture with Mickey before we were seated and then Goofy came to our table while we were dining. Minnie never made it to our table. Regardless, the breakfast as a whole was totally worth it (our 2 1/2 year old ate for free). Events: Aulani Starlit Hui was very enjoyable. We were pleased to stumble upon this event on our first night as it was like a short luau (1 hour max) without the food. Before the show that consisted of music and dancing, there were crafts and music for the kids. Get there early to get a front row seat. I can't say enough good things about the friendly staff. Everyone seemed so genuinely happy for us to be there. Aulani is so very subtly Disney and tastefully done. Even if you aren't a fan of the whole Disney thing, you will be surprised by this world class resort. We will definitely be making a trip back!", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Snohomish, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort, but some surprises\u201d", "Author": "illustris", "ReviewID": "UR120039699", "Content": "My family spent 6 nights at the resort. We don't travel a lot and this was the first vacation we've done in a few years. First off, The vacation was great and the gripes I have are minor. Overall the resort, in my opinion, is very nice. The room was very comfortable and roomy. Having the resort outside of Honolulu (about 15 minutes away) creates a very quiet, relaxing atmosphere. The staff was really fantastic, enthusiastic, and engaging. They did their best to accommodate us except for a room glitch when we arrived - see below. The kids had a great time at all parts of the \"waterpark\" at the resort: The two water slides, the \"lazy river\", and the pool kept them busy for hours while we were there. The \"daycare\" service at Aunties Beachhouse was really great, with great staff and lots of activities to keep the kids occupied and having fun including a row of computers, XBOX 360, WII, and I think a Playstation but not sure. There are also games on Microsoft's Surface machines which are pretty fun to play or even watch kids interact with them. There's a dress-up area, blocks for building, various toys, a kitchen that is used for group activities, and more. Snacks are provided every two hours. Expect to pay about $125 to feed dinner to a family of four (at just about any venue on the resort). This includes two alcoholic beverages. Expect to pay minimum of $50 for any breakfast or lunch for a family of four. We really enjoyed the buffet breakfast and dinner as the other venues had a narrow selection of food choices. It was difficult to get our kids to eat anything other than kid sized cheeseburgers (not offered at the buffet) and fruit. The dinner buffet offers a small selection of Sushi and Sashimi, Dim Sum, native cuisine, along with a variety of other dishes and all was quite good. There's really nowhere to walk to if you want to do any shopping. At the time of writing this, there was a small shopping area a short walk from the resort, but all the properties were vacant except for a couple of restaurants and an ABC Store (a big plus here -- save big on snacks and drinks while at the resort). I recommend attending the Starlight Hui: \"This evening celebration blends traditional Polynesian and modern entertainment, including hula performers, cherished Disney Characters and delightful surprises\u2014all in a beautiful beachfront setting!\" Take advantage of the Makai Preserve: \"In this conservation pool, encounter stingrays with the guidance of marine biologists. Reservations are required, and group sizes are small, ensuring a personal experience. All proceeds support Hawaiian research and conservation efforts.\" This was a neat experience for my seven-year-old son. I recommend the Rainbow Reef: NOTE: This is not a natural reef as I was expecting. This is a man-made pool, with artificial coral - a giant open aquarium for lack of a better term. There are tons of beautiful reef fish native to the Hawaiian Islands. It's a lot of fun to snorkel here but it's pretty cold. I recommend only buying the one-time visit as opposed to the unlimited visit package. I thought we'd be going back again and again but after the first time, nobody wanted to go back in that cold water. It was more fun walking 100 feet to the beach and lagoon where you can snorkel and see fish in their natural surroundings. It was really great! My son and I even saw a sea turtle the first day we were there! Tip: stay around the perimeter of the lagoon near the rocks to see the most wildlife. There are resort photographers at every event. If you want a picture taken the photographer will give you a \"photo pass\"card linking the photos with the card. The photos are stored digitally and can be purchased in the little store near the lobby in a variety of formats including DVD. Lastly, I was expecting the resort to be pushing us to buy into the Disney Vacation Club (DVC) but I was completely surprised that not one staff person even mentioned it. There is one channel on the room TV dedicated to promoting it, but that was it. Nice! Gripe 1: The room we reserved was not what we got -- we requested two queen beds and we received a king and a pull-out bed. We were not able to switch to the correct room and we were not compensated. Gripe 2: The information on the Web site lacks important details. We couldn't find the below facts on their website: -- If you take advantage of Aunties Beachhouse, your kids should be potty-trained or you will need to check on them every 45 minutes. -- The parking costs $35/day -- valet or self-park. -- If you want to leave your child at Aunties Beachhouse during a regular meal-time, you need to schedule a meal to be provided ahead of time. In other words, don't just show up expecting them to feed your kids a full meal. Gripe 3: We expected to see a binder in our room detailing all the features and amenities of the resort but couldn't find one. We called the front desk and they told us they don't provide that. It wasn't until we turned on the TV that we realized all the information is right there, in well organized menus on screen. I guess we're just too \"old school\", but really -- why didn't the front-desk tell us this in the first place?", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waukesha, WI", "Title": "\u201cIt's a Disney Experience\u201d", "Author": "Fuzz227", "ReviewID": "UR120001827", "Content": "So this is what I remember about staying at and with Disney.

I had very high expectations...I watched online as the hotel was built..I told my husband that we would go there when it opened and we would buy a Disney Vacation Club membership.. Unfortunately, the real estate market left us without the ability to buy in, but we loved this hotel. I don't understand the people who say it is not \"Disney\" enough...we saw hidden Mickey's, the characters were always about, and the cast members were true Disney........much more so than those I found in Florida. I loved every minute of my vacation there. It is very Hawaiian...you can learn so much about the Hawaiian culture without leaving the hotel. It is very Disney...perfect service and Mickey, MInnie and Goofy are around frequently. Chip and Dale make many appearances...Donald Duck is not around as often, but we did see him! (I am a DD fan!) Here is my list of pros and cons: PROS: It is beautiful, the hotel, the rooms, the lobby The service is excellent It's not Waikiki...that's a pro if you like a non urban setting The cast members...extraordinary The activities...so much to do, and many things are free! You could never leave the resort and still have things you didn't have time to do The lagoon...so clean and peaceful and just Hawaii as you wish it to be Very comfortable beds and linens The entertainment! It's just about non stop...we loved the Hawaiian music played everywhere The decor is fabulous Other than the food, we didn't find things too expensive, example, covered chaise lounge chairs for two were $40 for a full day...that is a bargain for beach life in Hawaii imo We loved it, just loved it CONS: It is expensive...the food is really high priced...but there are places across the street that aren't nearly as expensive Not enough food options for children The hot water seemed a little too hot for a hotel that expects many children...just my opinion. The cast members, while overall excellent still seem confused at times... example...we were at the buffet breakfast and a manager came up with three glasses of champagne and said it was on the house, for an anniversary...we were quite surprised, but happy. My daughter and I had orange juice and spooned that into the champagne to make mimosas...Next, a waiter came up and said that the three mimosas we had ordered were waiting...we had not ordered any mimosas and said so...they insisted that our table had ordered mimosas. We declined these drinks and asked for our check...and we were charged for three mimosas. When we told our server that we had been told the champagne was \"on the house\" and never ordered mimosas they took the charge off...but then the manager came up with three mimosas and insisted we had ordered them. We again said we didn't want them...and he said, just take them on the house, so we did. It turned out that our daughter's boyfriend had sent them as a surprise...and his one expressed wish was that we would not be charged. It ended up being a fun story to tell...but an example of the glitches that need to be worked out. They were great mimosas...and so kindly served. While we were at the Aulani maybe half of the hotel was dark. We had the best vacation trip ever, it was nearly perfect...but I worry about going back when it is full. Maybe we are just spoiled; it didn't seem like there was enough pool for 2 or 3 times the people. Oh, one other thing...I am sure it was just my stupidity, but the last thing we did at Aulani before we left was buy the Aulani Christmas snowglobe. I loved our stay so much I wanted to remember it forever...but probably I am the only person in the United States that did not know that snow globes are not allowed through security screening at the Honolulu Airport. I didn't pack it as it was the very last thing we did before we left the resort and I didn't want to repack my suitcase...but my beloved $40 snowglobe would have been $35 to check...plus the TSA stated they would have to accompany me to the Delta Airlines desk to make sure I checked it and then walk me back, and then search me. I decided to abandon it, my other option. The Aulani should tell snowglobe purchasers such as myself that snow globes must be packed in checked bags, as many of their guests are from out of state. A simple little sign would suffice. A slightly sad ending to a GREAT stay at the Aulani.

My 4 year old son, 2 year old son and 5 month old daughter had a blast! We are DVC members and stayed with a pool view. It was our 6th 2 week trip to Hawaii, but first to Aulani. Overall, the new Disney resort is 5 star throughout with only a few exceptions. The pool is great. A splash park for kids under 48\". a tube slide and a scary tunnel slide for older kids (though my 2 year old loved the tube slide). You can ride the tube slide with your child in a double tube. The tubes are free to use for the lazy river and the slide. They also have life jackets for the kids and adults also. There are plenty of pool chairs. We had to hunt for pool chairs on the busier weekends, but during the week there was plenty of room. We hit the pool at 7am when it opened. the river opens at 8am. Even at 11am, we were the only one in the huge, zero entry pool, on weekdays. They have hot tubs throughout, one with an incredible view of the ocean. The beach is fantastic with tons of space. The water is very kid friendly. My 2 and 4 year old were able to spend hours in the ocean. Beach chairs are free. They only charge if you'd like an umbrella or cabana. The charge for pool side cabanas is $275! I saw them being popular choices for the football fans on Saturday and Sunday though as they come with 32\" TVs. Some interesting tips: 1. book your character breakfast now! Very hard to get a reservation and very popular. The food is 2.5/5, but Aunty and the characters are great for the kids and they loved it. The dinner buffet is 4/5. Very good food, exceeded our expectations compared to other buffets. Quite pricey for our 4 year old ($22 for ages 4-9), but kids 3 and under are free for both breakfast and dinner buffets. AMA AMA, their signature restaurant, has an excellent setting and food is 5 star. they do the catch of the day 2 different ways and my wife and I each tried the different options. Both were excellent. The kids meals were great also. The rooms: The decor is beautiful. Again, 5 star. Not a ton of space though. The elevators - never had to wait for more than 10 seconds for an elevator the entire 7 nights there. The service: Excellent. Staff are very helpful. A huge perk is Aunty`s house. For kids ages 3-9 as long as they are toilet trained. My 4 year old wanted to go there all the time. We took our two year old and did some activities with him there, but the 3-9s can be left under their supervision between the hours of 8am-9pm (til 11pm on Fri, Sun and Wed) and they have so much to do there and the supervision (excellent staff) is included with your stay. Overall, Disney takes a backseat approach to ``Disney`` stuff with an emphasis on Hawaii and the culture. They do a great job of embracing the Hawaian experience. A tip if you arrive at night as the dim lighting makes it difficult to see the entrance. If you do drive, be ready for $35 a day for parking, but DVC members can park 2 cars free during their stay.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "st charles, mo", "Title": "\u201cHigh expectations and they were exceeded!\u201d", "Author": "mcavStCharles_Mo", "ReviewID": "UR119372872", "Content": "Just returned from a 5 night stay at Aulani. Wow, what a resort! The amount of thought and detail that went into the design of this resort is truly unbelievable. The beach is beautiful and the pool area is incredible. Our 6 year old son and 9 year old daughter would have been happy spending every day at the pool. On our last day my son and I did the snorkeling in Rainbow Reef while my wife and daughter went to the spa. Both experiences were great. The kids loved Auntie's Beach House which allowed my wife and I to have an extraordinary dinner at AMA AMA and visit Pearl Harbor on our own time. We also did the character breakfast...which was good...a little light on characters if you are used to Chef Mickey's but we still enjoyed it. The dinner buffet was incredible...so many different foods and they were all terrific. We had high expectations for Aulani and they were exceeded. Our only \"complaints\" were the lack of kids meal choices, especially at dinner and the lack of poolside bar service. Other than that our stay was exceptional. The best part about Aulani? The cast members. Disney cast members are always helpful but most of these people were extraordinary. One of our favorite parts of the trip was talking to the cast members and listening to their stories about Hawaii. Everyone was so friendly and eager to help...truly an incredible staff. We also liked the location of Aulani, especially after visiting Waikiki and seeing how busy and touristy that area was.

From the moment we arrived to the time of departure, we felt like we were part of the Aulani family and I cannot wait to go back. We were greeted at valet, bellman got our luggage, greeter gave us leis and fruit infused water and escorted us though the lobby to the registration desk. The minute they knew our name, each cast member handed us off as the Ryan Family. Nice touch to start. Teona checked us and and she was a delight. She made sure she had each girls names spelled correctly with their ages and I gave each girl a charging limit on their room key. It allows for them to have charging privileges without going broke. Very friendly and accommodating. We headed up to the room and the bellman met us there with our bags. Francis was our bellman and he quickly became part of our Ohana. He explained certain features of our room, then my girls showed him a feature even he didn't know. We saw Francis multiple times during our stay, passing in elevators, hallways and lobby. He always greeted us and asked how we were enjoying our stay. We were fortunate enough to be accomodated in a 1 bedroom ocean view parlor suite. It was wonderful. Great view, we could see the entire Waikolohe Valley and out to the lagoons and ocean. There was a king bed, Queen sleeper sofa and a single murphy bed that pulled out from under the TV. Great idea. Though all beds were a bit to firm for us. The master bathroom was wonderful, with a full shower with rainfall showerhead and handheld, separate jacuzzi tub, and the special feature? A Toto toilet with all the features. We had just watched a comedy show with this toilet in it, so the humor was definitely there. Features, front wash, back wash, back was soft, blow dry, oscillating, pulsating and a heated seat! It was all I could do to get the girls out of the bathroom. LOL Only complain here was that the bathroom was too dark with no makeup mirror. Definitely need one of those or better lighting. Make sure to get a copy of the daily 'Iwa so you know what is going on each day. Plenty of activities for all ages. My girls are 16, 15, 12 and 10 so we had all age ranges covered and they all had so much fun! Aunty's Beach House is like a kids camp, that you would pay about $100 for a day at other Hawaii hotels. This is included in the room rate. At first my youngest peeked in the window and didn't want to go in. She didn't want to be the oldest. Though once we went on a tour of all the rooms, I couldn't get her out of there. Large iPad tables to play on, dress up for the little ones, computers, arts and crafts, movie room, kinect dance off. So much for them to do. Some daily activities have a fee, though only if these are special things you want to do. My daughter signed up to do Fish are Friends and really had a great time learning about Fish, making food and feeding them. We didn't mind the additional cost. The older girls participated in teen and tween activities based out of the Painted Sky teen spa. Definitely more geared to the girls, though they have Xbox and computers for the boys too. They did a really fun scavenger hut with Flip cameras and went running all over the resort. I had cast members telling me how much fun the girls were having from so many different areas. They definitely covered some ground. One cast member who my girls loved was Aukai. He is like a pied piper there and the kids follow him anywhere. He also led the dance party at the Starlit Hui. What a fun evening. We swam in the pool, went down both slides, played pool games, floated down the lazy river. Discovered menehune along the trail, played on teh Mickey Mats in the lagoon, Stand up paddle board. And one of my favorite activities was the Sting Ray Experince where you get to touch and feed the stingrays. Pretty darn cool, about $50 per person. Hannah who worked in the towels, wristband booth, is a beautiful girl with a beautiful personality. Definitely a pleasure to have met her. Dining options, yes a bit limited. I think having a casual sit down place without the buffet would be good. We did the One Paddle, 2 Paddle for lunch and dinner one night. The food was fine, service was quick. And they were nice. My kids laugh as I talk to all the cast members, find out where they are from, met a few who were from Maui or went to school at Lahainaluna. I can honestly say that we didn't come across and rude or uninterested cast members. Each one had time to interact if just for a brief moment. I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to visit Aulani early, I believe about 1/3 of the hotel rooms are open. I am trying to figure how to get back over before the end of the year.

So far, we're not off to a good welcoming reception. Day 2, we decided to try the Makahiki for breakfast. When we got there, no one to greet us. So we walked in & hear someone calling out, \"do you have reservations?\" Not, \"Aloha, may I help you?\" I said, no, I didn't think we needed it, we're hotel guest & it doesn't look busy. Wrong! Dining reservations are a must or they will turn you away! Why wasn't I told this during the 15 minute check-in. They had 3 chances, but no one did! The host did mention the continental breakfast. We wanted a hearty breakfast, so we decided to go back to our room & order room service. Now, we've stayed in many hotels throughout the country & I expect room service to be \"fine dining\". Not true for Aulani! I asked for 3 glasses of water when I ordered our meals & it didn't come up with our meals. I asked for the water again & I guess he forgot, again! Maybe they were conserving water. No one ever told us why or apologzed for not getting it. Word to the wise, bring your own water! After our mediocre meal we went walking through the grounds. As we are walking by the lazy pool we noticed 2 pool attendants in deep conversation with each other, I'm expecting them to notice us, smile & hear \"Aloha\", but not at Aulani. Right as we pass in front of them, one says,\"no [--]!\" Still oblivious to me, my family & my child who is learning to talk & mimics everything he hears. Unbelieveable! His first \"4-letter word\" @ 2 yrs. I guess our expectations were too high for Aulani. Disney needs big improvements on customer service. Especially, here in beautiful Hawaii! They are after all, in the \"HOSPITALITY\" business! #1 on the list should be, \"The Aloha Spirit\". Where's the smiles, the greetings of \"Aloha\" as we pass by several employees who are too caught up in their own personal world. We felt out of place. No one ever called to ask if we were enjoying our stay after that 15 minute check-in. Just to get a call of concern that they truly cared about us. I would have addressed my feelings to any one of those first 3 people I came into contact with at the front desk. Overall, we didn't feel like we were welcomed from the get-go! More like outcasts & unwelcomed aliens on foreign grounds. Unfortunately, our first visit made quite an impact on deciding whether we were going to buy a time-share or visit Aulani again. Alas, Aulani and the people that represent it, at least the ones we had contact with, made it all too simple, NO!

We are not DVC members, and despite spending a small fortune our experience was mixed. On the positive side, the resort grounds are beautiful and our kids absolutely loved swimming and playing in the pools. Auntie's Beach House is a real treat for the kids, and the staff everywhere were friendly and helpful. The beach is very nice and the rooms were clean and safe, just like the whole resort. The first thing you need to know is that you must make reservations for the character breakfast and dinner in the Ama Ama restaraunt at least a week before you arrive. It seems that the breakfast and the early (sunset) seating for dinner are booked far in advance by locals (non-hotel guests). If you are at this resort for more than one morning, I don't know what you can do for breakfast unless you reserve in advance and pay extra for the character breakfast every morning, or order room service. Our second morning we were left sitting in a bar (yes, staring at the bottles of liquor) eating a $4 bagle, wishing I could have the continental breakfast experience at a Motel 6 instead. This experience was not a good start to an otherwise fine day. For dinner, you can eat at the Ama Ama (if you make reservations), where you can easily spend $100 a person, or you can go to the buffet which is somewhat less expensive. Neither option is ideal for young children, and you literally have no other options - you simply must leave the resort, especially if you want something for your kids. There is a taco place across the street and you'll have to drive quite a ways for anything else. (There is no casual dinner option for adults either. They do have a take-out counter where you can get a burger, which was not very good, and eat it on a bench or at your chair by the pool.) Despite the awesome appearance of the resort, the friendly staff, the excellent Auntie's Beach House and the photo opportunities with Mickey and other characters, we found this Disney resort to be child-unfriendly in other ways (limited to no food options for young children, beds that are very high). Finally, we did eat dinner in our room one night because that was the only way to get something for our children to eat. The childrens' mac 'n cheese came with adult-sized silverware and the kind of dishes you would never give to a 4yr old...

Even Disney is going to have some opening day jitters, missteps and problems. They were minor. I think we went through four sets of card keys the first day; a cabinet door fell off a cabinet in the kitchen, and the television wasn't working quite right. Really, for no doubt the first person to stay in the room, I think acceptable hiccups. Things that were wrong, but I'm sure fixed now --- they reserved out the main restaurant to locals the first weekend, leaving the hotel guests in the cold. Wooops. Generally they will need at least another restaurant. Only 1/3 of the resort is actually open (but you'd never know). So, what's right? EVERYTHING ELSE! My family loved it. My wife and I discovered that at 10 and 11 our boys can now be on their own. The mouse will take care of them! Our boys were out the door before us to get to the pools, and one night came home after us. They swam, they snorkeled with fish, they learned about stingrays, they learned to paddle board, they went out on a long boat to see dolphins, they sat around the fire ring to be told stories and entertained; they were shown Hawaiian culture by their new \"Auntie\", they went out to study stars with an astronomer through a telescope. And they could have done much more! We loved the character breakfast. To see my boys getting up to dance with their Hawaiian Auntie was priceless. For me, riding the lazy river with my boys, and tossing them around a pool was a memory that will not be forgotten. The price seemed reasonable. The nighttime buffet was we felt terribly overpriced, and more Japanese than Hawaiian. Mistakes we made: we went off property for a luau. Shouldn't have. There is so much to do and see in the resort, you don't need to leave. We didn't find out until the last days that you can allow very selective charging privileges on your children's cards. The Spa. It's amazing. Simply amazing. The treatments were great, but the facilities are second to none --- and my wife and I are spa dogs. There is an entire secluded relaxation area that was worth the visit to the spa. You can also gain entrance to this area for $40.00 if you don't want a treatment. This is nice because the supposed \"quite adult pool\" is not. The staff cannot do enough for you; typical Disney. Friendly, engaging, and very proud of their new resort. We will be back for Spring break in 2012! So, for a few gripes. The Marriott resort next door is a poor neighbor. The quite pool is next door to the Marriott employee parking lot. Loud radios, talking, etc. Then there is the problem of how to get to Aulani. Renting a car is expensive and a waste. There is no hotel shuttles, etc. Disney needs to introduce its Florida resort \"Magical Express\" to Aulani. Last one, Disney think about renaming the \u201cTeen Spa\u201d in fact it\u2019s a teenage hangout complete with a yoghurt stand.

The resort itself requires patient exploring in order to find all of its hidden secrets (which are literally all over the place.) The Disney elements normally associated with the brand are fairly low key at the Aulani, but this shouldn't be surprising since Disney has been saying from the very beginning their approach. Please note this review while long, barely scratches the surface because this was just a brief weekend stay. FIrst of all, there are naturally some growing pain issues to be expected which come about from any new opening of something this size. However, considering this is Disney (which is probably second to none when it comes to protecting their brand image), I was actually surprised by the number of glitches that I encountered during my short stay. Note that I didn't make a big deal out of this since I understand the logistics involved. Yet, I also have to say it was uncharacteristically un-Disney like as far as the overall experience goes. Cast members (CM) were overall friendly though some were getting noticably frazzled on this first holiday weekend since the resort opened. The Disney level expectations run high from those who have years of actual Disney work experience which includes being able to constantly have that happy face on even though you are stressing out behind the scenes; and there were clearly a few very green cast members who probably are getting their first real taste of working for a very brand aware corporation. As others had experienced, some cast members were not well informed (or their superiors did not do a good job of communicating changes.) I managed to talk candidly with some CM's who said they underwent several weeks of intensive training including having to role play and service executives from corporate who came to the resort to act as guests. Still, nothing can replicate having actual paying customers (some of the initial ones being hardcore Disney fanatics) who have an equal high level of expectation when it comes to Disney's legendary service and attention to detail. I'm not a Disney Vacation Club (DVC) member but I did manage to rent some points from someone I know who is a DVC member and thus was able to secure a reservation for one of the garden side villas. When me and the SO walked in, our jaws literally dropped at how gorgeous the room looked. Unfortunately, there seems to be a few workmanship issues inside the room itself as the water did not drain well in the shower (which was why there was already dark mold in some places of the grouting between the tiles.) Then the remote receiver for the LG HDTV actually fell off (must be those menehunes). It surprised me the room was turned over with the shower looking the way it did as Disney normally has a very strict room check at their resorts. The villa itself has a washer/dryer, full sized kitchen with full size refrigerator, microwave oven, drip cofee maker, dishes, utensils. For those staying long term, they will make use of these facilities since Ko'Olina is not Waikiki in terms of plenty of eating places. Since they anticipated both larger numbers of local Hawaii residents (who are purchasing time sharing units) as well as visitors from Asia, there is a Tiger rice cooker as well as chopsticks. Complimentary coffee is from Honolulu Coffee Company (the resort sources quite a number of materials including food products from Hawaii based company's). Wifi is free. The room can actually accommodate up to 5 people. The main bedroom has a large queen size bed which can fit 3, the sofa converts into a sleeper, and there is a drop down bed hidden below the television (the bedding is hidden in the coffee table). The bed was rather high and was also really hard (I like my bed firm but this was really a bit too firm for my liking.) Finally, the ambient lighting of the room is on the dark side (even if you open the curtains.) Some folks like their rooms bright and airy but the darkness lends a certain atmosphere to the room where it didn't really bother us. For those who aren't familiar, the resort is on the west side of the island at the foot of the Waianae Mountain range. The mountain blocks off the tradewinds so this area tends to be really hot and dry. The good thing is there usually is a mild sea breeze. Still, just standing 3 minutes outside on the lanai of the room to video and take photos of the resort was like being slow roasted in an oven. When the sea breeze is blowing though, relaxing on the chairs outside is nice. The labor day weekend of course added to the foot traffic as there were a lot of people (not sure if they were all guests) wandering around the Waikolohe Valley. Once the entire resort opens (two more phases; the next one opens in November and the last opens sometime in 2012) and occupancy further increases, it is going to get rather crowded down there. The resort ammenities are of course reserved for those who are staying at the hotel. Access to the Mikimiki fitness center is via your keycard. But how is the entrance to the water slide, hot tubs, pools and Waikolohe Stream enforced? Well, you have to show your room keycard at a kiosk near the pool in order to get a colored wrist strap. The color changes each day so you need to repeat this procedure daily. Note that enforcement of each person in a party actually having to show their room keycard seemed to be rather lax while I was there; something which they'll need to look at in the future especially as the rest of the resort comes online when there may be more paying resort guests. There are all sorts of activities like movies on the lawn in the evening, story telling by a firepit, scavenger hunts, trying to find all the little menehunes scattered throughout the resort (some of them are under the bridges which you'll only find if by floating through the lazy stream), the fiber optic petroglyphs on the ground, the taro patch, the sting ray pool, salt water tank, the Laniwai spa, and for the kids, Aunty's Beach House. Lighting (depending on the time of day) also changes the way the resort looks, and at night, it is even more dramatic. As far as resort dining goes, it is no secret that you'll be spending some money (details of pricing is all on the Aulani website as menus are downloadable). So I'm going to cut to the chase regarding quality, service, and variety. One of the nice things is a relaxed dress code (casual attire is perfectly fine.) As mentioned, there are some growing pains which need to be dealt with. 'AMA'AMA and its next door quick serve take out joint, One Paddle, Two Paddle had some teething pains in terms of quality of the food (the cooks prepare the food for both sides.) Initially, the angus burgers were sort of on the small side and weren't cooked as ordered. Also, some dishes in terms of its preparation and presentation at 'AMA'AMA also weren't of the quality you would expect from what is supposed to be fine dining. Note that we went once for lunch and once for dinner on separate days. We did this knowingly taking a hit to the pocketbook just to see how things were As far as service goes, the two waiters that we had for each occasion were excellent. They were very friendly, engaging, personable and attentive. Ask for Kevin or Frank as they are both great. Some of the hostesses out front while nice seemed to be a bit too reserved and soft spoken though. The dining experience starts there and it is what makes a huge difference as far as that extra atmosphere goes; more so when you are talking about what is supposed to be the signature restaurant representing the resort. Note that 'AMA'AMA will begin serving breakfast some time in November 2011. For dessert lovers, the Hawaiian Chocolate Cake with K'au Coffee Cream is to die for but it costs $10 for a very small piece (still, the cast members said this is a popular mover.) One Paddle, Two Paddle sells a less fancy version for over half the cost. Taking another hit to the wallet, we also tried the breakfast buffet at the Makahiki (character breakfast was unfortunately all booked) and to be honest, it didn't leave a \"wow\" impression on me. The food and selection were good but for the price, it also didn't blow us away. I've had some excellent tabehoudai (all you can eat buffets) in Japan for maybe half the price. One of the best brunch buffets on Oahu was the one that they used to have at the Sheraton Moana Surfrider (and for anyone who remembers, the buffet at the defunct Shogun Restaurant at the Pacific Beach Hotel used to be really good back during the heydays when the Japanese tourists were flocking to the islands before the bubble economy crashed.) The point is that we didn't find it extraordinarily special which is what surprised us. With that said, the variety of food (reasonably priced) is glaringly lacking as Ko'Olina in general does not have the sort of density that Waikiki has (this is by design) where you have at your disposal, fine dining down to inexpensive hole in the wall sort of places with cuisine from all over the world. And that is one of the great things about Hawaii, a wide variety of ethnic cuisine. As mentioned, 'AMA'AMA and One Paddle, Two Paddle essentially share chefs and so some items served are almost identical with just a few variations (plus a lower cost for the latter) which further reduces the choices. While the PR consistently mentions how Disney did their homework with the Aulani, it clearly does not come across with regards to the food. Furthermore, the Ihilani resort next door went through the same issue when they first started and provided the template and how not to do things. IMO, Disney will need to make some changes in this area. Fortunately, the Ihilani is a quick walk and provides alternative dining (though at similar resort prices) including a Japanese restaurant. Across the street from the Aulani is Ko'Olina Station which houses an upscale ABC convenience store called Island Country Market (there is a full service deli as well as a small selection of food which you can take back and prepare in the room.) There is also a Mexican eatery, an ice cream parlor, and a Hawaiian BBQ where you can get some reasonably priced plate lunches (two people can share one.) Kapolei is around 5-7 miles to the east and is your best bet for a larger selection of eating places as well as groceries. Obviously, having a rental car will be a must for longer term stays. The Ko'Olina resort does have a service called the Holoholo Shuttle which provides transportation to DFS Galleria in Waikiki, Ala Moana Shopping Center, and Waikele Outlet. A single day pass is $35 per person (5 day pass is $140.) So yes, factor transportation costs into your budget when staying at Aulani. FYI, hotel parking (self service or valet) for those who aren't staying at the resort is $35 a day (free 4 hour validation provided if you spend $35 on anything from food or souvenirs - very easy to do). For DVC members, parking is free. We also hit Kalepa's Store (which is the main gift shop) and the Lava Shack which is a smaller shop that is built into the side of Pu'u Kilo (the volcanic mountain where the two waterslides start). Prices of most items are resort friendly (meaning expensive) but there's some interesting stuff there. The Lava Shack also sells some food like sandwiches and ice cream. One of the interesting items I found at Kalepa's was the Ko'a wood postcards (3 types - Mickey, Minnie, and the Aulani Resort) which looked really classy. At $5 though, I wouldn't send one of these via postal mail since they'll probably end up getting \"lost\". Cast members here were knowledgeable and friendly; there was always one walking around at Kalepa's with a hand basket asking if you needed one for shopping. All I can say, it is easy to rack up $100 or more buying Aulani branded merchandise. There are quite a bit of hidden stories built into the resort which requires extensive exploring including talking to cast members (though as alluded to, it will take many of them time to gain experience in being able to really tell the stories behind the resort.) Considering there is no theme park associated with the Aulani, they did manage to find a way to keep families quite busy beyond the waterslides and pool so long as visitors ask questions of the cast members (else that aspect of the Aulani gets lost.) And unlike Disney's theme park resorts where the objective is to keep guests on the property and spending their money there, this isn't the case with Aulani where taking excursions out around the island is meant to compliment the story behind the resort. What remains to be seen is whether the relatively high price of the resort will be able to continually bring back both the local non-DVC guests as well as visitors from around the world. Hawaii as a destination can be quite expensive and Aulani pushes the budget even further. I can see Disney fans being the primary clientele but even a good portion of that demographic will find budgeting for repeat visits an issue. For Hawaii residents, the eating places at Aulani may not offer enough of a draw for them to make the resort a common destination for that purpose (that is unless the variety and value increases.) To be honest, there are better values in Waikiki so I can see the local clientele continuing to make Waikiki establishments their primary destination for special occasions. Overall, Disney did a fairly good job with Aulani where it doesn't look like a white elephant stuck out in the middle of nowhere. Even the Disney elements are understated where the focus is mainly on the Hawaiian culture and heritage (though it would be nice to actually have just a tad bit more Disney sprinkled throughout the resort including a few more characters) since it is something the kids really look forward to seeing. Finally, while the cast members were overall great, there were still some rough edges which need to be smoothed out, but that should naturally come with experience. The actual grand opening (with all the bigwigs and celebs) is the last week of September so the cast members will have had several weeks worth of servicing actual guests to draw upon as far as finetuning goes. We did revisit a week later on a weekday just to see what the resort looked like on a non-weekend (that also was not a holiday) and the guest traffic was noticably lower. Some tweaks were also already being made such as reducing the refillable mug price from $32.99 to $18 and the $99 length of stay beach rentals being removed (only the hourly, half day, and full day rental charges remain.) Overall, I rated the property as very good but that 4 circles should be more like 3.5 as it was better than average but had some un-Disney like flaws. The same applies to some of my other ratings when it came to rating a very good (as those were also more like 3.5's.) If you were to ask me today would I stay there again within the next few years, my honest answer would be no; as there really isn't anything compelling. If there was far more to do around the Ko'Olina area including a larger selecting of dining within walking distance, then that might change things. Maybe if there was a bit more Disney (and by that, I mean maybe just only a tad bit more), then that too might change things. Again, I know from the PR that this was intentional but still, we personally felt something was missing. It cold just possibly be opening issues which will get ironed out over time so I plan to read other reviews and see how things go as time passes.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange, California", "Title": "\u201cOpening Week\u201d", "Author": "em p", "ReviewID": "UR118343017", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at Aulani, we were one of the first families who paid to enjoy the resort and I don't regret our decision.

The staff of the club is friendly and they use the same tracking wristband system as the cruise. They need more food options, the ones they have are tasty but pricey.

Since I am a Vacation club member, we had a 2 bedroom villa and a studio. The rooms were spacious, and accomodated my large family perfectly. We had a full kitchen in the 2 bedroom so we cut down on how much we ate out by cooking some meals in the room. The beds were a little high, but were incredibly comfortable. The kids all had fun trying to find \"hidden mickey's\" in the room and around the resort. There were lots of activities, not just for adults, but for kids and families too. The kids loved the pool area. The lazy river and the 2 slides quickly became their faves. Every once in awhile, they took a break to participate in one or two of many kiddie participation activities where characters like chip & dale and even goofy would show up to help them. The \"daily Iwa\" that we got every day listed all the activities going on. The kids were able to pick what they wanted to do and it helped us plan our day. We even took the kids to \"aunty's beach house\". As long as the activity isn't a premium one, it's free.. you just have to register your child/children and they get a wristband that has a chip in it. They use it to check the child in and out of the beach house. It was a great way for the kids to do things on their own, like play games, do activities, play dress up, and let the adults have some time to themselves. We went to the firepit storytelling one evening and it was so much fun. \"Uncle\" tells stories about hawaiian myths and legends around a huge firepit. Most of the time, there are short song verses for the audience to sing in response to certain parts of the story. \"Uncle\" was very engaging, and kept everyone entertained. we even got to ask questions about other things afterwards. He even told us about certain things to look out for around the resort in the evenings ( i.e. items that light up, shadows of hula dancers that move on occasion, etc). We even did the menehune adventure trail. It's a lot like the Kim Possible game at walt disney world. you get a little interactive device, and are sent on your way to help Aunty find menehune. There were lots of things that you pass in the resort all the time, thinking that they're just decoration, when in reality, they're part of the game and \"come to life\". They said we could cycle through the adventure as many times as we wanted and that there were over 20 things to do. Each game is random, so they said we would never really get bored. The kids were having so much fun that we cycled through the story twice.. it felt like we were only doing it for a little while. When we finished, we realized that it had been over 2 hours! The kids had a blast finding everything. All in all, my family had a great time. Everyone had fun meeting Mickey, Stitch, Goofy, Minnie, and the rest of the disney crew. The many pools, water play areas, menehune adventure trail, and wide variety of activities kept the kids busy and completely entertained from early in the morning to late at night. Everyone insists that we go back and we hope to make this a yearly adventure. So, if you're coming to Hawaii, I would definitely say you need to at least experience Aulani for a few days.. it's a must do.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Beautiful\u201d", "Author": "hicat", "ReviewID": "UR118006383", "Content": "The new Aulani Disney Resort is a must see and experience for everyone.

Awesome SERVICE\u201d", "Author": "Shawn S", "ReviewID": "UR117841251", "Content": "Trip consisted of my husband and I (for our anniversary) and our cousin family (mom,dad and 3 kids). We are all from Hawaii but since I can't speak for them I'll write this from my experience. What stood out the most about this experience was the service. Id say their level of service was equal to that of a Four Seasons. But of course that is the Disney way. As we drove to the Ko Olina gate they asked for our name on the reservation, checked us off, gave us directions and waved us through. We drove up the driveway and were greeting by the Pat the bellman by name. We decided to valet park so they took our bags, taged them and introduced us to another guy (Sorry I forget his name) He gave the ladies leis (orchid and tubberose) and the men got a kukui nut lei. The kids each got a tiki necklace. After offering us some fruit infused water he took us inside gave us a brief tour and explaination about the hotel and where things are. He then checked us in and answered any additional questions. Our room was ready and since cousins room was not we all went to our room and Pat (the bellman) brought our bags. He showed us around the room and explained about the tv, how they have all the adapters to plug in your wii or ipad, showed us where the bedding was for for the hideabed (bedding is hidden in the ottoman/table), and even refilled ice into our cooler. After checking out our room and huge bathroom we noticed a message on our phone. We had a message from Mickey and Minnie singing us a song for our anniversary and welcoming us to Aulani. I'd suggest that if you celebrating anything to let the hotel know as Disney will try to do special things such as this. Now it was time to play... we changed, went to the pool area and enjoyed. The kids water feature was lots of fun for the boys with the waterslides and surprises. They have towels down at the pool as well as life vests for kids. We played in the kiddy area for a while then went to the big pool and slide. The body slide was faster then any I've been in at a hotel and was FUN!!! The tube slide also seemed fast and we all enjoyed that alot. Oh before going into the pool stop by to get a wrist band. The really good thing is they allow kids of all ages to go down the slide even with their life vest on. Their are other hotels that donm't allow kids with any flotation devices on the slide. Of course in true Disney style they have life guards all over the pool area. I think they are positioned so that each lifeguard can see each other and their scan area overlaps with the other person. That is something that is enforced strongly. No playing on the slides without a band. If you like to snorkel you can pay extra to snorkel in their man made lagoon stocked with fish and hidden creatures. I bought a length of stay pass for this. If you like to play on kayaks, stand of surf boards and other things you can buy a length of stay pass that includes everything. The big plus I noticed in the pool area is the water dispensers. They are located throughout the area and it was always filled with ice water so you could stay hydrated while enjoying the pool. We were there for 2nights and 3days so I'm not going to write everything as they happened but if anybody has questions please message me and I'd be happy to assist. After the pool we checked out aunty's beach house for the kids. We all took a tour and the kids loved it so they decided to stay. The way it's handled there is very secure. You register (of course), put emergency contacts and anybody who is authorized to pick up the kids, the kids are given a wrist band with a gps tracker like thing so they know where in aunty's house they are at all times. Then to pick them up you have to show your id and give them the special password that you registered them with. Inside Aunty's house they have a dress up area (princess, buzz, woody, pirates and others), large touch screen table games, computers, wii, play station, xbox kintec, board games, play kitchen area, arts and crafts room and a tv room with comfy chairs (at night they put out blankets incase kids want to sleep before parents get back). They also have organized activites that happen in there. They also offer snacks every few hours for the kids. The kids loved it so much they couldn't wait to go back and were a little bummed when parents came to pick them up. For me it's a good feeling to know the kids enjoy themselves there so it's not as if they are being \"dropped off\". It helps the parents be able to enjoy adult time and not worry about the kids. The kids enjoyed it so much that at dinner one night the kids wanted to go to Auntys so their parents left dinner, dropped them off and came back to enjoy dinner and the bar. My husband and I did the menehune trail adventure which was lots of fun. It's similar to the Kim Possible adventure at Epcot. It's a phone like device that you talk to Aunty who sends you on different quests. Each quest will make something happen. Rocks move, things come up from places you never knew they were, lava flows and erupts, plants shoot water, etc. There is about 5 different adventures. I'd say this is something for older kids to do since you have to find the spot on a map or younger kids with parents help. Seeing the special effects will definately be enjoyed by all. We swam in the snorkel lagoon which I enjoyed but my husband thought it was just okay. Being from Hawaii it's not really a big deal since we often swim in the ocean with fishes. I liked it because I was searching for those hidden rock creatures. They do require you to wear a life vest while snorkeling. The blow up one that they give out felt like it was choking my neck so they let me use one of the childrens vest and that worked great. They really don't care what type of vest you use as long as you have something. During certain times of the day they have fish feeding and if you are in the pool at this time you can watch them feed the fish which you swim around. If snorkeling is not for you then you can view the fishes from an underwater viewing window. We did the Kula Wai treatment which is an hour of soaking in their different baths, showers and tubs. It was an awesome experience and they didn't rush us out even if we were over time. Our cousin did the couples massage and enjoyed that very much. I talked to others who said that the Disney Spa and experience topped any others they have been to except one in Brazil which was actual hotsprings. Prices were comparable to other spa prices but even in there the Disney Service was exceptional. We did the Makahiki Character breakfast which was fun. I would have liked to see more characters but it was still nice. While at breakfast Goofy and Minnie came by our table at least 3x. Mickey is at the front greeting people and taking pictures. Aunty comes out and sings songs and they lead the kids on a parade around the restaurant. No complaints about food or service. We also did the Makahiki dinner buffet which was also great. My husband especially love the beef brisket. The kids buffet area had a good choice of items and the kids loved it. The fastest way to get food around the pool area is to go to the take out counter, and bring it back to your chair. Hopefully later they will have more pool attendants for drinks and food. Check out was fast and easy. They do have a lounge area where you can store your things, shower and change before your flight. Or for us after we checked out they kids could swim, and then shower before heading home. When we went got our car Pat was our bell guy again and talked to us about our experience and how we enjoyed it. Then as we got into our car the nice guy who greeted us and checked us in came out to see us and thank us for staying and asked us about our visit. I thought it was a nice touch that they remembered us and took the time to say thank you. If traveling with kids this is a must. The price maybe higher then other resorts but they do have many free inclusions like Aunty's beach house, pool parties, star gazing, talk story time at the fireplace, etc. With the service and activities I think the hotel is priced very reasonably. For adults only.. if you are like us and love Disney and want exceptional service then this is great place to stay. If you want a quiet pool area there is an adult pool and the of course you can enjoy the spa. In the beginning I compared Aulani to staying at a four seasons well it's very similar with the service aspect but what I enjoyed is it's very casual with no dress code. Most high end resorts require you to wear cover ups when not at the pool or have a dress code for the restaurants well not at Aulani. People were at dinner in shorts, t-shirt and rubber slippers (typical attire for Hawaii). Sorry it's this is a long review but there is so much to say I wanted to make sure that people knew how great this resort is. We had a great time and can't wait to go back.

We had a king room with a sleeper sofa which is made just for Disney. It had a particularly thick mattress and seemed like it would be perfectly comfortable even for an adult. I love that they keep a Pack-n-Play in the closet of every room so you don't have to ask for a crib to be sent up. Unfortunately when you have the sleeper sofa and Pack-n-Play assembled there's not much room to walk around. We liked the rain shower head and the handheld one (makes rinsing kids after their bath much easier). It's nice that the hotel has recycle bins in the rooms and all around the property, but I wish they were labeled to let you know what items are recyclable there. Our kids loved the Menehune Bridge water playground. The lazy river was neat and this is usually a favorite attraction of mine, but this one is unbearably slow. I noticed that not many people used it, and those who did could be seen swimming or if riding on tubes constantly pushing themselves along. There were always a ridiculous amount of leaves in the river. Hopefully once the newly-planted trees get settled in they will stop dropping so many leaves. It's cool that the two water slides don't have a height restriction and the tube one accepts double tubes so you can go down with your child. I was surprised that the Menehune Bridge had a 48\" height restriction (for my tall kids that means they can only use it until they turn 6) although I never saw anyone around to enforce the rule. We were surprised to see so many lifeguards watching every inch of the lazy river and the main pool. FYI none of the pools there are over four feet deep so it's more of a wading pool than actual swimming. Our favorite thing was the dual level waterfall spa overlooking the beach. You're supposed to get a wristband every day when you pick up your towels for the pool. This allows you to use the water slides and if you pay for their man-made lagoon snorkeling ($15-20) they will punch the wristband so you can come back and snorkel again later in the day. The way the hotel is shaped makes the pool area like the bottom of a canyon and the wind really whips through there. We noticed a lot of plastic cups, napkins, lettuce, etc. strewn all around from the wind when people were eating poolside. The poolside dining staff never seemed to be around when we needed them. Once they offered my son a refill of lemonade and just never came back with it. After that I gave up on the service and just went over to the bar anytime I wanted to order something. We were a little annoyed that the buffet restaurant didn't open until 7 AM. Coming from California that felt like 10 AM and we were starving. On our last day there we had an early flight and had to leave before the restaurant opened. The only other place that serves food in the morning is at the bar outside the buffet restaurant. They call it \"continental breakfast\" but you actually pay for each item (e.g. yogurt parfait, croissant). We found the food at the buffet to be pretty good but the price was outrageous. It is $43 per adult for dinner and $27 for breakfast. The portions are tiny, which is good in a way because it enables you to try a lot of things without getting stuffed or wasting food, but also annoying if you just want a regular sized serving of one thing. We really wished we could just go to a regular restaurant and get an egg white omelet or pancakes for our kids without spending over $100. One morning we walked over to the JW Marriott Ihilani next door and did just that. Their buffet, which has a much larger selection than Aulani, was much cheaper (can't remember adult price but kids were $9 and they charged only $3 for my picky son who only wanted scrambled eggs). At the Aulani sit-down restaurant 'Ama-'Ama, we enjoyed the gazpacho soup and grilled veggie sandwich on ciabatta bread (although some would say they were both a little oily). I wanted to try the goat cheese ravioli but couldn't get a reservation to come back. My husband was annoyed that his red wine was served too cold. The waiter explained that they keep all of their wine refrigerated since it's too hot there to leave it out at room temperature. We've never encountered this elsewhere in Hawaii and didn't see why they couldn't have taken it out of the fridge for a couple of hours before serving it. Aulani's restaurants seemed great for people who enjoy local, organic, gourmet food but they didn't have much regular American food. We heard a lot of people complain that they couldn't get their kid a hot dog or a turkey sandwich. We had an issue with the kids club when they wouldn't allow my son who is allergic to dairy products to bring in his own food. They insisted that the only food that can be served there is from the \"private dining\" room service menu. There was nothing on that menu that my son could eat so we had to order a turkey wrap asking for no cheese. We found out later from my son that it was served to him with cheese and he had to try to pick it off by himself. The shave ice stand charges $5 and doesn't offer ice cream. The poolside menu is very limited and the items are great for dieters but not filling enough for a normal person who is swimming and working up an appetite all day. People couldn't believe that there weren't more restaurants. It was hard to get reservations at the two restaurants and we all wondered how they would feed people when the hotel is fully open (I believe only 2-3 of the 7 towers were open the first week). We were quite relieved to find that the hotel gift shop had a decent select of grocery items and the prices weren't much higher than local markets. We bought bread, sliced turkey, mayo, mustard, bagels and peanut butter. They also had a lot of frozen dinners but we weren't sure where to find a microwave since our room didn't have one. There's also an Island Market ABC Store just across the street from the entrance of the resort which sells groceries and produce (don't miss the yummy apple bananas!). There is a mexican grill and an ice cream shop over there, too. The best thing about this hotel is that the kids club \"Aunty's Beach House\" provides free childcare for kids age 3-12. I could not find any other hotel in Hawaii that offers childcare for 3-4 year olds. It opens at 8 or 9 AM and closes between 8 and 11 PM. It is enormous and very clean. They require everyone (including parents coming to pick up kids) to wash their hands before entering. Upon their first visit, the kids are issued a wristband to wear for the duration of your stay. This is used to check them in and out of the computer system. My only complaint is that my kids ages 3 and 7 played video games the entire time. I wish there was a way to set a time limit for that or have that room separate so parents could decide whether or not to allow their kids in. I enjoyed the beautiful 1.5 mile walk on the paved path along the four lagoons of Ko Olina. There is also a magnificent beach if you walk north just past the JW Marriott. The lagoons are roped off so that you cannot exit them to get to the waves. There doesn't seem to be a beach with waves within walking distance, so don't plan on boogie boarding or surfing here. You can rent kayaks (a double was $30/hr) or stand-up paddle boards but the lagoon is pretty small and we got bored after the first 10 minutes. We were quite surprised that the property was not \"more Disney.\" If we hadn't noticed the name Disney on the sign we probably wouldn't have known it was a Disney property. You will not see Disney characters in the decor (except for a brown wooden lamp base shaped like Mickey in the room) and only a few times a day are their character visits down by the buffet restaurant. The only time we saw Mickey was at the very end of the nightly entertainment (it was hula and ukelele the night we went) but unfortunately by 8 PM Hawaii time our kids were so tired they didn't care to stay up and see the characters so we took them up to bed instead. There is a wooden statue of Stitch over by the kids club that could be easily missed. They did a wonderful job designing the decor of the hotel and the landscaping outside in keeping with the vintage Hawaiiana theme.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Pool, Facilities but staff needs more training & need more characters\u201d", "Author": "penguinorama1", "ReviewID": "UR117591701", "Content": "I am writing this review on day 2 of our stay at Disney's newly opened Aulani. Overall the stay has been great, but could've been out-of-the-world if it weren't for the kinks of a newly opened hotel. We are traveling with 2 adults, 2 kids 6 and 4 years old. The first day we spent all day at the pool. The pool is amazing. We have stayed at many Hawaii resorts with great pools, but the Aulani pools are the best by far. They are also super-family friendly. They provide life vests for free for all kids, and there are life guards at almost every 20 yards. They are also always standing, and ready to help, and always smiling. They have 2 incredible slides built into the mountain structure in the middle, and they don't have a height or age restriction - which is very rare in this litigious times - so our 37 inch tall 4 yr old daughter was able to enjoy the slides like her brother. There is a body slide and a tube slide, and both are fun, even for adults. There is a life guard at the bottom to help, but the life vests keep the little ones afloat even if they cannot swim. There is also a lazy river all around the property and an adult pool. There are swim tanks (for extra fee) where you can swim and snorkel with tropical fishes in super clear water, although there is a perfect natural lagoon right outside the property as well. The room - which literally are brand new - are also great. Good size and if you get a king + sofa sleeper, perfect for a family of 4. The sofa sleeper is better for the kids if they roll around and may fall. The regular beds are raised quite a bit off the ground, so its a good 3 feet if you fall. The showers have rain shower heads and the tub is big enough for a good soak. Decor throughout the property is understated elegance in a tropical style with a touch of Disney. It really is well thought out, and full of surprises for the kids - like hidden wooden statues throughout the property. As wonderful as this stay has been so far, I have also never had to complain so many times during a resort stay. The service and overall operation still needs a lot of kinks worked out. The staff have apologized numerous times with the excuse that they are still new at this. But its not like the customers get a discount for it being \"new\", so I am really sick of hearing that excuse. First negative experience was at the famed Character Breakfast - when you pay over $100 for breakfast, you expect \"Characters\" like Mickey and Minnie to make a round to talk to your kids at the table. There were only 2 characters Minnie and Goofy, making the rounds for approx 40 tables, and with the staff being \"new\" they kept of missing our table. After 45 min I finally went up to ask them to come to our table, but got brushed off by the staff. Then after 90 min, I had to call the manager of the restaurant, who then said it was not the restaurant, but the DPI Manager who was in charge of the characters. Finally after the righteous parent with 2 disappointed kids act, I got Minnie & Goofy to come to the table, but we could not enjoy the breakfast given that we were stressed out about the characters the whole time. Then they charged $32 for the photos with Mickey at the entrance, and you had to decide while the photographer was standing over your shoulder. Overall, I feel that given that there are all these kids who are here because of the Disney magic, it would be better if they hired more characters and rotated them in the facility more often. Right now to get a picture with the characters, you have to line up for 30 min on the walkway at specific times of the day with other harried parents. And there is a handler who is always hurrying things along because the characters are on a tight schedule! There are a lot of teenagers in Oahu, who I'm sure will want to work in a costume. Hire them. It would truly be magical if Minnie and Stitch were casually strolling along in the lobby, or if they were floating in the lazy river next to the guests. The property has done a great job of not pushing Disney in your face, but the characters really need to make more of a showing here. The second negative experience was poolside dining service. The staff seems to be a mixture of great employees who go out of their way to help, and newly hired people who are a little clueless. I had to walk over to the bar numerous times because our waiter would just disappear and not be around for a long time. But the guy at the bar was very nice, and offered me a complimentary beverage for my troubles. Getting a room was also a problem. We arrived early so it was expected that we did not get our rooms right away, but even after the regular checkin time our rooms were still \"not prepared\". When I went to ask the front desk, they had to send someone to housekeeping to see if they had finished. Then the guy came back to say that he couldn't find the housekeeping staff. Do they not have phones? Or is this a whole ancient Hawaii theme of having \"runners\" and smoke signals for communication between floors in the buildings? Finally, we tried to get reservations at the 2 restaurants on the property, and both of them had no available tables until late in the night. Then when we went there at 6pm, about half of the tables were free and we were seated right away. I understand they have to keep some tables open for walk-ins, but I think they can do a little better with managing that since we were about to leave the property for dinner given that there aren't other dining options. Overall - we've had an incredible time here, and the facilities are among the best in Hawaii, especially for the kids. And once the kinks are worked out, I'm sure the service would be top notch as well.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA-Mazing!!!\u201d", "Author": "Mommyto3girls", "ReviewID": "UR117514374", "Content": "We attended a character breakfast here on the first day it was offered.

The hotel has 3 of 7 towers open right now and scheduled to be fully open by next March \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of hotel and vacation club. I did not stay the night at the property and it was the grand opening so staff was probably 120% of normal, but here are my observations. The lobby is very nice and very well done in wood throughout, with a nice open air view of the ocean and pool complex. They had musicians and bands thoughout, although I think the only standard one will be at the bar on the ground floor. The one thing that will stand out is the pool complex \u2013 amazing. They have slides, many pools / hot tubs, a huge kids water area, lazy river, shade, and tons or chairs (we will see if they have enough come March). I know that the Hawaii purest are not going to like the pool being the focal point and not the ocean / beach, but it is very nice. They share a lagoon with the JW Marriott next door \u2013 it was pretty calm and nice, but all the Disney folks were at the pool. I counted 4 restaurants on my walk \u2013 all of the prices were \u201cresort\u201d prices and nothing seemed too crazy high given all the factors (Hawaii+ Ko Olina + Disney + Resort). There were only a few maintenance crews out doing repairs which I thought was pretty low given opening day. The biggest surprise was that I didn\u2019t see many Mickey\u2019s everywhere \u2013 now that I am writing this I will have to go look again because I can\u2019t believe it \u2013 maybe they really stuck to the Hawaiian theme.
