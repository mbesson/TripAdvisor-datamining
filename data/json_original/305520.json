I had a warm welcome from the front desk upon arrival. Our room may have been recently renovated as it looked brand new.

They have a nice pool and I enjoyed sitting outside watching my kids play and swim while I drink my pina coladas and mojitos (thanks Donalde)! Breakfast was of good quality and I enjoyed the Indian food in the morning. Don't worry: there are Western and Chinese options as well! I got an excellent rate at an excellent hotel. For $22 Sing you can arrange a child's check-in: it includes ice cream, a teddy from Hamley's (a British FAO Schwarz-like toy store) and lots of little extras.

We were a group of about 25 people and had booked the hotel well in advance. It all started when I was told upon arrival that my reservation could not be found. Instead I was offered a room rate that was considerably higher than the pre-booked one. Throughout my stay I had various managers attend to my problem and a day before my departure I was assured that everything had been clarified and that I would be billed according to my confirmed booking. The next day when we tried to check out: pandemonium. The front office had no clue who should be paying which rate and who was part of the group booking and not. As a result, people were asked to pay higher rates for their room and internet. When I complained to the manager, the mistakes were corrected.

The first impression you got as you enter the spacious but busy lobby was that it was a 3 star South East Asian Hotel. To the left was the reception and cafe and to the right was the bar. There was a 3 piece outfit belting out some tired old numbers accompanied by synthetic third rate music. Not a good introduction but the room was a game changer. It was newly renovated. A hotel with timber flooring will score well in my review, it does not matter that it was laminated timber. The study table and the big flat screen were welcoming although its relative position will allow watching while you are in bed. The bed and linen was so comfy. I slept soundly.

One for those who have and one for those who haven't. I think we came into the latter but as my title says you get what you pay for. This hotel is situated right at the top of Orchard Road very close to all of the shopping malls and only a 5-10 minute walk to the nearest MRT station but quite a distance from most of the attractions, The Singapore Flyer, Clark Quay, Marina Bay etc We arrived early in the morning well before check in and the receptionist could not have been more welcoming or more helpful. She explained that the room was not ready yet but checked us in and told us where we could get changed and have a shower if we wished (towels were provided) and what time the room would be ready. We used this facility then left our cases and went out for a coffee and a snack. When we returned the receptionist smiled and said she had been looking for us as our room was ready. How is that for service. We were disappointed with our room as it did look a little \"tired\" and in need of a make over but it was clean, the bed appeared to be King size and the sheets were soft and clean, but the bathroom like the bedroom was in need of renovation. Once you look around you can see how the hotel is split, even the lifts take you to different floors. I didn't realise this until I took the lift from the pool area (on the 4th floor) and realised it did not take me to my floor. Like a lot of people there appears to be a problem with the key cards as ours failed to open the room door and we had to have it re-programmed, and yes it may have been with my mobile phone but I have never had this problem before so maybe the hotel should look into this problem. We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the food, but yes the alcoholic drinks in the bar are expensive but if you come to Singapore you have to expect that. One big minus as far as we were concerned was the \"ladies of the night\" on Claymore Street which is on one side the hotel leading off Orchard Road right where the pedestrian crossing is. I doubt if the hotel can do anything about this as it is a governmental problem (it would be interesting to hear what the hotel has to say about it as it is not the image any hotel would want to portray) (By the way we are not prudes, we lived in Singapore when there were more brothels than hotels) Did we enjoy our stay at the Orchard Hotel, yes, but it would have been much better if all the rooms in the hotel had been renovated not just those in the Cleworth wing.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wairarapa NZ", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "GolfersWairarapaNZ", "ReviewID": "UR125423037", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel for 6 nights in Feb, location is perfect, for restaurants bars, shopping!

But, it is also close to the MRT station and taxis are right outside (and relatively very cheap), so it is easy to escape to more interesting parts of town if desired. The hotel staff were very welcoming, and while they couldn't solve every problem, they certainly didn't skimp on trying. Some staff shone even above the others with the friendliness of their greetings each morning at breakfast. Rooms... Fine, just about every hotel room I've stayed in has something to quibble about, so I never expect perfection. In this case the most obvious thing was that the shower temperature varied from cold to boiling in response to a handle movement of approx 0.00001\" (or 0.0000067cm in new money). The bathroom sink was also curious, as at times I got hot water from both taps, which was a novelty when teeth brushing. Air con also seemed to have no in-room override, so one was stuck with the temperature set centrally or perhaps by the cleaner. The hotel is next to the Orchard Towers, which has a sleazy reputation. When out and about with my partner I didn't notice anything, but one evening briefly ventured out on my own. Now, I may well be a more than averagely sexy babe magnet (or,er, not), but getting propositioned by beautiful young Asian women 5 times in about 50 feet right outside the hotel was good going even for me with my lived-in-but-still-got-it looks. Ahem. The place is ex-pat central, and seeing the dismal taxi queues of elderly white blokes, beerguts-a-hanging, holding hands and avoiding eye contact with wee Asian women the age of their daughters, was saddening. Cooling off was possible in the 4th floor open air pool, where you may also have to jockey for a lounger with the vast numbers of overlaying Lufthansa staff (the hotel seems to have a contract deal with das airline). Food and drink not cheap, but then little is for the visitor to Singapore.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oldham", "Title": "\u201cGood location, tatty room\u201d", "Author": "kaspiraitus11", "ReviewID": "UR124708564", "Content": "Spent 3 nights in this hotel Feb '12 whilst visiting our Singapore plant for 2 days.

A pianist is featured in the evenings in the main area while a live band played in the bar.

So, despite the fact that many business people and international airline crews use the hotel, and that it cannot police it's surroundings, I would give it a poor rating, especially if you are on vacation.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cAlways a good stay\u201d", "Author": "william820", "ReviewID": "UR121384343", "Content": "The Orchard is a very good hotel located right in the centre of Singapore at the end of the main street, Orchard Road.

The room rate was reasonable compared with other similar hotels during this period but we felt ripped off by the end of our stay. The room was very small and dark, didn't have a fresh feel and looked onto the side of another building. There was an overwhelming feeling of disappointment as we walked in. The porter that brought the case in did not lift it onto the rack for me, even though it is obvious that I am pregnant, then hung around for a tip - needless to say he didn't get one. The cot requested for our toddler was in the room, however this left no room down one side of the bed due to the cramped size of the room. There was also no blanket provided for the cot or additional towels for the baby. When I requested these things from room service there was a long delay before they were brought, and the staff who spoke virtually no English brought wrong items before they understood what I was asking for (and I consider myself as a good communicator with non-English speakers as a teacher of ESL). The location is a 20-minute walk away from the station past a building on a notorious street corner full of prostitutes and I felt uncomfortable although not totally unsafe as a woman walking home alone at 10pm. The swimming pool was dull and was not suitable for families. The children's room advertised on the website was a bare room with the shell of some sort of wendy house and no toys or facilities for children. Also, be warned that taxi drivers know this as the Orchard Hotel, NOT the Millenium Orchard, which is what our emailed booking form called it.

When I complained about this to the manager he was not interested saying that they send the dresses out to a local company and it was not their responsibility if the dress was damaged! He offered some compensation in the form of knocking the use of the business room faculities off our bill, a total of \u00a360, but this was not even half what I had paid for this dress!!!

The reception very kindly changed our room, only she did not hesitate to mention that i had booked a superior room only and that was their superior room. I found that very odd because it did not look like any of the superior room photos i had seen and superior should not mean dirty! We chose to forgo our booking the next time I went to Singapore I chose a different hotel and it was lovely. It is my sons birthday in November and he really wants to stay at the orchard hotel because he only came the first time and loved it. I have booked to go back there due to the first time the room being clean and nice. However i do have very mixed feelings as i was so very disappointed the last time I was there in April. But in all fairness the reception staff were very nice and changed my room immediately. The area is great for shopping and its easy to get around as there are plenty of taxis and the MRT and buses are not far. You can easily get to the Bugis st markets and the zoo quite reasonably price wise. The breakfast at this hotel was lovely and I felt safe in the hotel. Its hard to rate as i was so very disappointed the last time i stayed there but the first time was good and my son and I were very happy.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201c4 stars hotel, but worth 5 stars\u201d", "Author": "Jeffon2011", "ReviewID": "UR118547628", "Content": "I staied there for 18 days.

Let's concentrate on the hotel experience: Check-in was smooth, quick and effective. The room was spacious, well furnished and well lit. One thing I do not understand is why hotels do not equip bed side tables with power outlets! We all carry phones that require charging at night!!! I used the Lobby restaurant buffet both for dinner and for breakfast. Breakfast was fine, plenty of choices, a cooking station and quite a selection. The problem (totally unexpected and unacceptable given the quality of the property; Orchard Hotel) arrived at dinner, at the cooking station: I wanted some fried Noodles and I asked the \"chef\" to please prepare me some. He points me in the direction of a hot station where (in fact) there were some Noodles. I asked if they were spicy and he confirmed that they were. When I said I could not tolerate spicy food and that I wanted NOT SPICY Noodles he kept pushing me towards the hot station (they were spicy Noodles!) I said I wanted NOT SPICY Noodles and he kept insisting on the spicy ones. I had to raise my voice and get the support from another very dissapointed guest and finally His Highness agreed to cook my Noodles. Needless to say he did not put a lot of effort into it and cooked a basic dish. I asked for chicken or shrimp and he waved me away. I honestly felt bad, very unconfortable and totally bothered. I was not expecting such a behaviour at the Orchard Hotel. I would go back to the Orchard Hotel because I am sure this problem I had happened because and only because, the chef that was at the dinner buffet when I got there was very unprofessional, lazy and obvisouly had a very bad day. Nevertheless, the Orchard Hotel should keep such employees controlled and monitored. Nowadays most customers you loose is because of small details.

But years pass by without any upgrade and you note the wear and tear on the furnitures. Same goes for the TV system! You get 3 TV's in the room but only one has clear picture! And when it comes to choice of channels, well far below standards! The controls are all worn out and you just get frustruated to even bother! Location of this hotel is great, close to shopping and nightlife, the neighbouring tower can be disturbing for families to pass by though! The rooms are not very quite as the dooropening are far to high and sound slips through. Not that there are much traffic but avoid having your room close to cleaners lockers etc. I have most of the time been very pleased with the staff except my last two trips! The Signature club staff were new faces to me and I have not seen anything even close to rudness they showed me and my business partners time after time. First of all the breakfast; no attendance at all, food is finished quickly and you need to get the coffe yourself! Nobody bothers to even ask! We had a meeting 1 hour after the breakfast time was over, but none of the tables were cleaned, and when I asked somebody to wipe one table so me and my collegue could seat! The young mans (Mgr) face looks chocked at me stating yeah yeah! coming! After 15 minutes and another reminder he comes with a over wet towel and make one wipe where all the dirst ends up on our knees and walks away! The table was so wet so I had to wipe it off myself! Again the next and next breakfast so I ended up eating at the office instead! But the check out takes the price, where I had to reschedule and get back early morning! So I go to the reception for the signature club which was unmanned (06:45 AM) and knock on teh door to see if somebody would help me! At 06:55 the same rude young man opens the door and says we are preparing the breakfast, dont have time and shuts the door again!!!!

Unfortunately during our stay- the hotel has undergone some renovation, and loud noises permeated to our floor were beyond description.

It is very unfortunate taht the hotel should sell these rooms affected by the noises to Conference participants whereas the conference had been planneda year ahead or so. Breakfast at the lobby adequate with western, and Asian food- however; with this level of hotel- one would expect a little bit more varieties and quality and attention to details- such as labels of Chinese dishes remain the same every morning while the food inside was different. The egg station chef was not that patience when one requesting an extra minute frying. The fruit remains similar for three consecutive mornings.

In retrospect, I regret not choosing a better hotel nearby. The rate is expensive, even when we had negotiated a package rate. Otherwise, it's totally not worth it to pay the rates indicated in the hotel website. The bad impression starts right from the time we arrived at the hotel. No door men were present and guests arriving in have to help themselves with the luggage. On entry, a long queue was formed at the check-in desk and the long waiting left me fuming. Despite the queue, only two staff were available to assist on the check-in. What? The others having tea-break? I took 20 mins to wait for my turn and another 10 mins for the reception staff to check us in, despite already having our bookings in record. The bad impression continue into the room. The so called Deluxe room is shoe-box size. Standard furniture and basically standard 3-star hotel decor. The bathroom light gave out a buzzing sound every time it is switched on. There are visible stains in the bathtub. The hotel must be practicing cost cutting because it doesn't even provide dental kit in the bathroom. Why must I waste time to call for this simple and very basic amenity? Breakfast is included but all the sub-standard stuff and when glasses and food frequently running out. Check out thankfully was faster but that's because I can't wait to depart from this crappy hotel. By the way, there is also a long queue to wait for taxi in the morning. And about service, what service? The whole stay is like checking into a dormitory, queue for check-in, queue for breakfast, queue for taxi. The staff are just indifferent and make no effort whatsoever. Perhaps they are just doing their job according to what they are paid and nothing more. Overall, the hotel location is good since it's in Orchard Road but that's the only redeeming attribute.

Came back at 10pm, asked if the room change was ready, and we were given an upgrade to the clubfloor, which was a nice gesture. However, during the entire stay and as a hotelier myself, there is a serious lack of initiative and courtesy from the front desk staff, both lobby and clubfloor. I asked to replenish the bath gel, they replenished the moisturiser instead ( they should have the initiative to see that it was the bath gel container thats empty, while the moisturiser bottle is untouched!) At the front desk, the Front Desk Assistant who checked me in never smiled. And when I came back to the reception to lodge a complaint, he saw me and he whispered something to his colleague, right in front of me, which was very rude. He should have the courtesy to ask if anything is wrong with my room. He doesn;t understand what it means by TO OWN THE PROBLEM. I chose to have breakfast at the coffee house, and I requested to have a look at the buffet before deciding to dine there. One of the lady supervisors bumped into me and asked if I would like to pay with cash or credit card !!. I dont expect the staff to know every guests, but have the courtesy to ask for room numbers first ! Besides the location of the hotel, I see no reasons to return.

The hotel is located at Orchard Road which is the \"main street\" for all the shops, malls, various restaurants. It is a nice 10 minute-walk to department store such as Takashimaya, ION, etc, so if you have no access with transportation, I would highly recommend this place. The hotel is bit worn out, hence the price for this hotel is probably the most reasonable compared to other \"high-end\" hotels on Orchard Road. The room I stayed in was cozy, not too big but not too small where you cannot move around. The amenities weren't that great -- mediocre shampoo/conditioner/body shampoo. Oh and yes, bring your own toothbrush/shaving kits as there weren't any -- and we weren't going to pay for the service (tip) to bring them up to our room. We ran out of hot water in the evening but with the hot and humid weather of Singapore, this wasn't an issue in the morning :) Morning buffet was good in terms of selections (Asian, Western, and some mixes) - but we had to wait a long time for our cup of coffee to be served, and this, mind you, was the case for all three days we stayed... But if you are patient and not in a hurry (like us), that wasn't a big issue. Concierge and bell service people were all so nice - helpful, kind and also friendly! The only regret we have is that we didn't even know that there was a shopping arcade right next to the hotel until the day we were leaving! Yes, they even have Tony Roma's! So if you stay at this hotel, be sure to check it out, including the famous Chinese Restaurant, \"Hua Ting Restaurant\" which conveniently located inside this hotel (we also didn't get to go - so definitely next time!).

Since our company booked and paid for the hotel, I cannot comment on the cost/price. When I was younger and used to travel to Singapore for sports competitions, we would also stay at this hotel so I already knew what to expect when I was told that Orchard Hotel would be where we would be staying. Location: The location is great because it is right on Orchard Road. Extra plus for me since our regional office is right across the street so no hassle in having to take a cab/MRT in the morning for our meeting. It is next to Orchard Towers though, which is famous for you-know-what, but I didn't have a problem walking to the hotel from Scott's Road at 3am. In general though, Singapore is a pretty safe city so not much to worry about there. Rooms: My room was very clean and very quiet. Didn't have much of a view though. I can't remember what the name of the wing of the hotel was called but it's not on the Orchard Road side. The bathroom was nice and clean (I'm really picky and OC when it comes to this). It had a window from the shower that looked into the room, which is great for honeymooners I guess? There's a shade you can pull down though so no need to worry! Shower was really nice - you had your regular shower head coming off the wall then another rain-type shower. Water pressure was extremely strong so no problem there and the hot water was great because I love taking hot showers! The amenities are the usual - shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower cap, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. Complimentary water (not sure if this is daily or just upon arrival). Not sure about the mini bar either since I didn't take anything from it. Food: Didn't get to try the breakfast but I don't remember anything bad from when I used to stay at Orchard Hotel when I was a kid. Didn't order room service either so I can't comment. Your on Orchard Road though so there are a lot of places to go and check out instead of holing yourself up in the hotel. Check-in/Check-out: No problems checking and checking out. We arrived in SG around 9am and got to the hotel around 10 and we were checked in and brought to our rooms right away. Flight out of SG wasn't til 8pm - tried to get a late check out but they were fully booked so didn't allow for it. They did have a holding room for our luggage which was great so we could still go out before heading to the airport. Overall, I would say this hotel is pretty good.

I am writing this to describe one of the most horrendous stays we have ever had at a five star hotel in our entire lives. We had come for the Chinese Golden Week holidays AND my own birthday. We walked into the hotel upon which we were told the hotel was overbooked, and the room we had booked was not available. We had booked a Superior Smoking Queen Room in the new wing. We were then told we would be \"upgraded\" to a Deluxe room in the old wing and so waited accordingly. After an hour the room still wasn't ready until we had to stand at the front desk for another 20 minutes until it was. We then were taken to our room which not only had filthy carpets but also had a stench from the bathroom. We asked for the room to be changed which then took another 30 minutes! We then went out to take care of a little shopping before meeting our friends for dinner and upon coming back we moved the sheets on the bed and found a large BLOOD stain on the bed and the covers! This was 100% from the previous woman who had stayed in the room and it was during \"that time of the month\" for her obviously. We complained about this and we were simply threatened by the staff that we would be downgraded, upon which I yelled at the staff telling them we just wanted the room we booked in the first place which the hotel couldn't provide because it was overbooked. This whole process took about 45 minutes and at this point a new room was still not ready and in this time our dinner plans had to be cancelled and we were forced to eat FAST FOOD because all other restaurants had their kitchen's closed and we could only meet our friends for a short 1 hour instead of the several that we had planned. We were forced to leave the hotel to come back at 2 AM to change rooms in the middle of the morning! All we heard from staff was \"sorry and the manager has more important guests to attend to\". This was absolutely ridiculous. They finally were able to give us a superior room in the new wing but a NON-SMOKING room which is not what we booked. Finally we were approached by the Assistant Manager from House Keeping and offered a plate of fruit for our troubles! This is how a five star hotel treats a guest staying during China's golden week in the hotel and who is paying an average of 220 SGD per night?? After talking to what we were told was the \"Duty Manager\" who was actually some assistant he simply told us that they didn't care about us, and that they were authorized to only give us a free breakfast as compensation when the people at the checkin desk already knew that we did not want breakfast as my wife and I prefer to eat later in the day. We were then approached on the 4th (My Birthday) and asked whether we had in fact smoked in the non-smoking room wherein we truthfully told the manager that we had as we had booked a smoking room and the hotel couldn't provide for us. He then in a threatening tone told us there would be a 100 SGD extra charge per night but because he was a nice guy he wouldn't charge us for it. Really? I came to Singapore to stay in a 5 star hotel for my birthday and holiday to be threatened by some random Asian assistant? This whole time we were not able to see the Front Office Manager which we demanded to speak to because apparently we were not important enough for his time. On the final day, the front office manager finally actually came into work and after seeing all the different things his staff had done was obviously very shooken up as he should have been considering the ridiculous service that was being provided. He was extremely apologetic but this is just several hours before we were checking out and obviously he had spoken to his staff sharply about their behavior as they seem to at least have a little respect for the guests that day. The manager then proceeded to offer us a 20 SGD taxi transport to the airport, which actually costs the hotel practically nothing in petrol. We are very strongly considering contacting the Singapore Ministry of Health, any other government organization involved in inspecting hotel facilities for cleanliness, the straits times, the China Daily, and various other chinese tourism agencies, telling them about everything that we have experienced. I know for a fact that the blood on the bed was in fact a very serious health violation according to Singapore law under which the hotel will be investigated and shut down temporarily until the situation is solved. The staff at the Orchard Hotel is the most unprofessional and unfriendly workers at a five star hotel that I have ever seen.

We found our stay very enjoyable. It took 5 minutes to walk out to the main strip from our room. We initially lined up at reception in the main lobby room and waited close to 30 minutes to be served. We were third in line as well. When another staff member approached us at that point and helped us with our booking. It turned out that check in for signature club members is located elsewhere upstairs so we were shown up to the club lounge. A very friendly staff member organised our check in and told us we could sit in the lounge and help ourselves to the drinks and snacks available whilst she did this. This check in was very efficient (as was the check out when we left). We pitied the people who had standard rooms and had to brave the downstairs front counter. We were very pleased with the standard of the room. It was new and the furnishings and decorations were tasteful and of good quality. One of us noted with delight that the decorative pillows on the bed were silk as was the backdrop behind the bed. The main room and bathroom were very clean. The size of the room is not too squishy for two people but would be too crowded for three. The view was not something you'd want to stare at long, just a construction site. As per other views from any other hotel along orchard road, which is probably why it has a really small window. The room came with a king size bed which was very soft and comfortable (so were the pillows). There was also an evening turn down service. There was a couch and coffee table, a flat screen TV, desk with stationery set, free broadband Internet connection for laptops. The bathroom was most appreciated by us as it came with a separate bath and shower and the toilet was partitioned by a door. The shower came with a rain shower function which is now a feature I'd like in the home of my future. Water pressure was good. The bathtub was roomy and came with bath salts. It also came with a cushion so that you can sit back comfortably in the tub whilst you watch TV in the bathroom (yes, there was another TV, this one in the bathroom). We also liked that all the lights in the main room and bathroom were able to be dimmed.The main room had BOSE speakers that were meant to be able to play mp3s but no cable was supplied (but we didn't ask for one as this was not of importance to us). Room service was average. We ordered a club sandwich which was nice but was a little small for the price at $25 SGD, which is quite expensive for the price of food in Singapore! However we were pleased to note that room service was available 24hours. It took half an hour to come. We also had initially placed orders for brownies but the kitchen had run out. The purchase of the type of room we had allowed us access to the signature lounge, which was beautifully decorated and well maintained. It was also lovely that whenever we went there it was never overcrowded. Throughout the day we were able to help ourselves to small cakes and snacks, soft drinks, bottled water or coffee (a very good coffee maker was available). These were all free. The lounge also included free broadband internet access (one computer only) Canap\u00e9s were served at night which were of lovely quality and wine was also available (however we cannot comment on the quality of the wine they had on offer as neither of us drink).

Yes, the hotel has been around for some time now, and the interior is aging a bit, but it's still a nice, comfortable, and very convenient (location wise). Best of all, it's not too busy and crowded like most of the other more expensive hotels deeper into the main part of Orchard Road. Nevertheless, I was very satisified as I could sleep in peace on a nice and comfortable bed. Yes, the standard rooms are a bit small, but not as bad as some pigeon hole rooms I've stayed at other nearby hotels. The only complaint I may have is that even though you get two small complimentary bottles of water, the larger bottles are a bit of a rip off as they cost $16 for two medium sized ones. Not really a problem though as there are markets and 7-11s where you can buy them for $2 for a large bottle. The gym was small to medium in size, but well equipped and pleasant to work out in. The pool is pleasant, but most of the deck chairs are usually taken whether the sun's out or not. Great to be able to just sit by the pool and relax by ordering snacks and drinks at the poolside bar. My rate didn't come with breakfast or internet, but I was offered the two for an extra $30 per night, which isn't too bad a deal, so I took it. The breakfast buffet was well worth it. Nice spread of different varieties, usually fresh as the turn over is high, and of very good quality. There must be something good about this cafe as it always seems crowded at breakfast time, lunch time, tea time, and dinner time. I'd actually been going to the Chinese restaurant at this Hotel (Hua Ting) for many years now as it has the reputation of being one of the best in Singapore, for regular meals and dim sum. They've run out of room the actual restaurant itself and has now expanded out into the common are outside the restaurant. However, I'm not sure if they can cope with the volume as service (although excellent) was a bit slow. I enjoyed the lobby lounge even though there was no longer a live band there, as I was told their contract had run out. Nevertheless, nice ambiance to sit there and chat with friends over a drink and snacks, or just watch \"interesting\" people walking through the lobby. Oh yea, there are no longer massage therapy rooms at the fitness center, so it's all done in your room now. If you're uncomfortable about letting strangers in your room, then there are plenty of other massage joints in town.....depending on the type of massage you're looking for..... *wink* *wink* :) If you're looking for a good regular massage, then it's best you ask the concierge or receptionists to direct you. Otherwise, you may get something more than what you're expecting ;) I'm not a bar hopping type person, but there are plenty near by that are quite popular hot spots.....and pick up joints. aka Orchard Towers.

The primary purpose of our stay was business-related. For majority of the time I was placed in a room that looked like the one pictured as their \"Deluxe Room,\" but with Executive Club access. I had the Red-colored \"Deluxe Room.\" It was tight on space, but adequate for one person on a long stay. It may be too small for a couple who plan on staying longer. The bathroom is tiled black and a little dark, but I think it's because some of the lights were burnt out. Of this room, the shower was the best feature. Towards the end of my stay, my spouse joined me in Singapore and we were moved to the \"Signature Deluxe Club,\" also with Executive Club access. We had the Green-colored\" room as currently pictured on the hotel's website. Together we stayed in the \"Signature Deluxe Club\" for a little over a week. Had we not moved from the \"Deluxe Room,\" it would have been difficult to keep the peace. The \"Signature Deluxe Club\" was perhaps twice the size of the \"Deluxe Room\" and included a larger bathroom with a soaking tub, a seating area and simply more space to place luggage and to walk. Our room was directly below the Executive Club area and noise seemed to travel very easily. Without trying hard, we heard a lot of walking around going on upstairs which made it difficult for us to sleep in. Having stayed only in the Executive Club, we unanimously recommend it. The service in the Club is outstanding. It made the stay from good to great. They helped me navigate around the city and even recommended a top notch floral shop. I wanted to pickup some flowers for my wife when I met her at the airport. The breakfast selection is smaller than the one downstairs, but the service sets it apart. We preferred the smaller selection in the Club. We had breakfast around 7:00AM, so we did not encounter many crowds. The small snacks throughout the day and cocktail hour were a nice touch. You may encounter more crowds during cocktail hour. There is one laptop and access to a printer in the Executive Club, as many patron are primarily on business. Our stay included internet access and two (2) pieces of dry cleaning service per day. With that said, when you stay at the Orchard Hotel, we recommend you stay in the Executive Club levels. The service downstairs is good, but not the same as that in the Executive Club. The front desk is helpful, but face many more guests so the personal handling is like most other hotels of this caliber. The breakfast buffet downstairs is hectic, loud and fast-paced. We wouldn't say it's necessarily a great deal, as there are other breakfast joints down the street for half the cost. The breakfast buffet downstairs is convenient. The bell service is a little slow, but we didn't problems getting a cab. The fitness club is older, but okay. We did not use the pool or the mini golf area.

Please, Orchard management, the carpets are UNACCEPTABLE and should be replaced immediately. It created a very negative first impression. The decor was bland, and was actually depressing, with no splashes of colour whatsoever. The bathroom was very dated. After 2 nights, I was so unhappy with my room that I asked for, and was shown a room on the Signature Club floor (i.e. the equivalent Executive Club floor, but in the Orchard Wing; the hotel's 600-odd rooms are distributed over 2 wings). What a revelation! The Signature Club rooms are exquisitely done by a famous French designer, Jacques Grange, in a very tasteful Chinese theme, but with all the comforts and technology expected of a 5-star hotel, even though the Orchard is rated 4-star. The drapes are electric, with a superb Bose Wave radio/CD player, and large plasma TV. Bathrooms are done in black granite, with an LCD television recessed into the wall in front of the bath. It was like I was in an entirely different hotel, not just a different wing! I immediately arranged to be moved to a Signature Club room, and thoroughly enjoyed the rest of my stay. The standard rooms (i.e. non-Signature Club) of the Orchard Wing) are still better than those of the Claymore Wing, but it is undoubtedly worth paying extra for the Signature Club. In all my travels, nowhere have I seen such beautifully-decorated rooms, and the pictures on the hotel's website do not do them justice. The breakfast buffet in both the Executive Club and Signature Club lounges are identical, with cold and hot items, and a dedicated chef for a la carte eggs, up to international standards. I was happy with the large outdoor pool, as well as the gym, whose range of equipment was better than many 5-star hotels. For a 4-star hotel, the Orchard isn't cheap, but I would recommend paying a little more for the Signature Club, whose benefits include (apart from breakfast and all-day refreshments in the Club lounge) in-room Internet access and laundry/dry-cleaning of 2 items daily, as well as unlimited consumption of the mini-bar drinks (but not snacks), whose range is admittedly limited. The Orchard is situated at the Orange Grove Road end of Orchard Road, which means a 10-minute walk to the main part of Orchard Road with the department stores. If you enjoy heat and humidity, then this can be pleasant, but it wasn't exactly fun for me. The lobby is large, and is perpetually busy, not just because the Orchard is a large hotel (and it is, with over 600 rooms), but the main restaurant occupies a part of the lobby, and its patrons create a lot of noise, which makes for a nice \"buzz\". I am undecided as to whether I would stay at the Orchard again.

Pool is great to cool down, but the pool side service could definitely be improved, as could the breakfast offer in the Club lounge and the computer access in same ( a laptop and tiny printer do not cut it for business travellers). The Business Centre on the Ground Floor is not very much better. Service was excellent but it did take over 30 minutes to get my room key, and laundry that was due back before 2pm returned at 5pm (on the day I was leaving) so I recommend you tell them you need things faster than you actually do!

The hotel lobby is classy and spacious and was decorated elaborately for Christmas. The staff were very professional and friendly. We ate breakfast each morning at the hotel's breakfast buffet as it was inlcuded in our room price. The buffet offered a wide variety of western and local favourites. Most days this was not a problem, but one morning the main dining area was too busy so they had additional seating on the upper level with it's own tiny buffet. The food choices on the upper level were not as elaborate and only had the \"main\" items from the buffet down below. The staff frowned upon getting food from downstairs and carrying it upstairs. I do think this was only a problem due to the busy holiday season, nonetheless it was a minor problem. We reserved a table in the dining room for the Christmas buffet which offered many different selections of meats, cheeses, salads, potatoes, desserts, etc. The price was reasonable for the wide selection that was offered. The room we stayed in was quite spacious and very clean. We may have been upgraded upon arrival, but was not made aware of this if we were. There is chargeable internet in the room. You can charge per day or per hour ( I think). I would choose the per hour option if I were to stay there again. When you charge per day you actually get 24 hours of time, it's not really \"per day\". So I was charged two days, but only used a few hours of time. The concierge was helpful in getting taxis, stamps, and keeping our bags after we checked out, but still had the day to spend in Singapore. However, to learn about tours and sight seeing in Singapore, they send you to an outside vendor that is located within the mall directly attached to the hotel.

I stayed here in March 2006 during my stopover on my return journey from New Zealand, spending nearly 3 days in the balmy 33\u00baC of Singapore before returning to a cold (4\u00baC), wet London. My room was lovely, well designed, with a spacious marble lined ensuite. The hotel is huge and the vast lobby of the hotel hosted live music in the evening. I arrived at 9.00pm in the evening and by the time I had sorted myself out the hotel restaurant was closed (more about the restaurant below). Hungry, at 1.00am I ventured downstairs to the reception to find out what kind of food was available through room service or locally. I was asked if a dish of fried rice was acceptable, brilliant I thought, not the usual fare of congealed potato wedges and dips. Less than 15 minutes later a steaming plate of food arrived with not just fried rice, but chicken, singapore noodles, spring rolls and other goodies. The service at the hotel was the best I have ever experienced. The Orchard's restaurant offered an \u00e0 la carte or buffet selection, both of which were of the highest standard. I was in my element at breakfast time with a wide selection of breakfast fare, a choice of eggs (scrambled, poached, boiled, fried or omeletted to order). I chose to return to the hotel for most of my meals during my short stay in Singapore, as the food was so good. The hotel is situated close to the shopping area on Orchard Road, where you can visit the designer shops, or buy electronic goods and jewllery for far less than you would in the UK.

However, on my last stay they seem to have dropped the ball. I stayed in an Executive room in the Ochard Wing which is the room grade I normally choose but based on my last stay, I think I'll explore other accommodation options. Firstly, the room tariff has increased to SIN$400 per night + 10% service fee + 7% GST. I think the Orchard is becoming a little expensive. Secondly, the executive checkout wasn't functioning (so I was told) when I tried to check out and I was told to go downstairs to the main desk. This didn't worry me unduly but one of the things I like about the Executive Club is that you don't have to wait in line to checkin or checkout. After waiting for 10 minutes to reach the front of the queue, I was told by the staff member that I could have checked out upstairs. When I stated that the staff member upstairs told me to come to the main checkout because of a problem, he didn't look very impressed and neither was I. Lastly, on each occasion that I've previously stayed @ the Orchard, I've sometimes tipped for excellent service and sometimes not if I thought it wasn't warranted. This last visit was the first time that I've seen staff on 2 seperate occasions obviously stand there waiting for a tip and not being at all backward about it. On a previous visit I had asked about the service charge on the room and had been told that tipping was not necessary as the service charge covered this aspect, and besides \"this is Singapore and it's not considered to be polite\". If you consider that the service charge on my room was SIN$40 per night, that's a lot of tipping value that's supposed to be distributed amongst the hotel staff.

Service: Average, not impressed. From check-in to check-out, I don't think I saw one smile from the front desk staff and barely heard any Hello's or Good Morning's. Bell staff were the friendliest and always offered to help when concierge were busy. Housekeeping barely speak English but always friendly. Rooms: At first, we were placed in the Orchard Wing. room was a bit small, bathroom sink space was small, and shower was open with no curtains or door, but i loved the rainshower. amenities are decent. Beds in Orchard wing were small and our safe did not work, even after we asked Housekeeping to come and fix it while we were out. The second day there, we tried taking a short nap but the corridor was extremely noisy with the staff door opening and banging shut at least once every 15 minutes. So we complained to front desk and they upgraded us to a Superior room in another wing. This room was more spacious, bathroom was a lot bigger and there was a bath and separate shower staff. We stayed in room 750 with a view of the pool. beds were bigger, but my mattress was uncomfortable and i could feel the springs on my back! at least the safe worked and closet was bigger. Facilities: We used the gym and swimming pool everyday. fitness center can be quite crowded with guests and their personal trainers. swimming pool size was very decent and it never got too crowded, but i think the pool needs to be cleaned as i saw some green algae growing in cracks on the side. Food: We had breakfast every morning for S$20 (special hotel rate). good breakfast buffet with fresh fruit, Swiss yogurt, pastries, congee, eggs, sausages, etc. Singapore Overall: We spent 4 nights in Singapore and did pretty much everything that one tourist could possibly do. Weather was quite warm and humid. Visited Little India (nothing to see), Chinatown (loved Ann Siang/Erskine roads and The Scarlett Hotel with the rooftop restaurant), City Hall areas, hotel hopping, Singapore Art Gallery (neat colonial-style building), Sentosa (nothing to do and barges disrupt the view!), Orchard Rd (some great malls like Takashimaya, Wisma Atria, The Heeren), Tanglin Rd (nice new St Regis hotel and some neat shops in Tanglin Centre), food courts and Lau Pa Sat (great food!), Clarke Quay...

We had two rooms one double and one double with extra bed, on both visits we had to request the extra bed on arrival as it wasn't already set up. A little frustrating as we arrived late with jet lag and the kids were desperate to get to bed. It also meant that we had to split the family up, one adult in one room with a child and one adult with the other two in a different room. The food at the hotel was ok.

A couple of things which did impress us, my husband left a jacket at the hotel on our way out and 5 weeks later it was waiting at reception for him on our return trip. The pool was quiet and plenty of loungers and towels. Drinks very expensive though.

I found the bathroom especially interesting as there is large round window between the bath/shower and the living area of the room. The only complaints about the room are that you can not adjust the temperature even though there is a thermostat in each room. They keep the air conditioning in the rooms set very cold! The other issue was that the carpet in the room was very dirty and didn't look like it had been cleaned in years.

We stayed at the Orchard Hotel for a total of two nights, three days. We chose this hotel because of its central location, and because it was hosting a conference we were attending in Singapore. We booked a room online with the triple B package. We were given a Superior Deluxe room with Internet access. It turned out the room had wireless broadband access, which was a plus. We drove into Singapore in a rented Malaysian car. As we drove into the front drive to drop off our luggage, we were completely ignored by the doorman. We stood and waited for five minutes until we were able to flag someone down to help us. In front was a van of European tourists, who were immediately attended to. As it was Christmas season, the check-in desk was understandably busy. However, the check-in desk was understaffed and disorganized. There was no sense of queue, and we had to fend for our place in line. Our room appeared hastily cleaned, and the floors were unvacuumed. The room was quite noisy at night. The breakfast spread was large, though once again, the service was questionable. Although we had booked for two people, the hotel made a mistake in the number of breakfasts allotted to our room (i.e. one breakfast for two people). The server was disagreeable, and didn't even think to give us the benefit of the doubt. She went to find the manager, and then halfway there, she realized she had made a mistake and quickly led us to a table beside the kitchen. Upon requesting to be seated in a quieter location, she snapped back and said that all the tables were full, though in reality, the entire cafe was probably half full. The final straw came at check-out, when I went to ask the concierge for driving directions back to Malaysia. Behind me were three young girls from Thailand, and I felt that the concierge was more interested in picking up these girls than helping me with my directions. Upon asking for the directions, the concierge then went on to say that \"he didn't know.\" And when asked if he had a map, he said that the hotel didn't have any, when in fact the previous day they had given me a map. Afterwards, I overheard the concierge attempting to pick up these girls, asking them for their name cards and phone numbers. I was disgusted. When I brought up the issue with front desk, they quickly found someone else to give directions, and indeed, they did have a map. The customer service at Orchard Hotel is spotty, and at the very best, second rate. It appeared to me that customer service was conditional on your appearance, and secondly, your country of origin. Coming from Malaysia, I felt that we were treated less favourably than if I had waved around my Canadian passport (which I didn't). I am extremely dissapointed with Orchard Hotel, and I don't think I would ever stay there again. I do not recommend this hotel if staying in Singapore. I believe one can get much better service, and much better quality of accomodation for less.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Provo, UT", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Orchard\u201d", "Author": "maddmax", "ReviewID": "UR6353139", "Content": "The Orchard was booked for us by a local government ministry.

Once in September 2006 for 12 nights, the other in October 2006 for 5 nights. In the first stay, I stayed in a 'Signature Club Deluxe' Room in the Orchard Wing. These rooms are very well decorated (though almost to the point of almost being over the top). The bathroom is great (including a TV over the separate bath), and the bedroom has a couch and LCD TV. In addition, the room has many conveniences including push button lighting and automatic curtains. All in all it was a pleasant stay, though I must say that colleagues who stayed in the 'ordinary' rooms were not as impressed with hotel. While I didn't see their rooms I suspect there is large degree of difference between their Signature rooms and their standard rooms. For the second stay, I was upgraded to a suite, which was comparable to the Signature Club Deluxe room, though with a separate bedroom from living room, a walk-in closet (first I have seen in a hotel) and much larger windows. All in all, the Signature Club Rooms are very nice and you are unlikely to be disappointed. However the hotel does have room for improvement\u2026My critiques are: -In both rooms there were problems with the 'Do Not Disturb' button (one wouldn't turn off, the other would turn off randomly). -In one stay the hotel room regularly lost power one day (this may have been a one-day occurrence) -In room movie options are very limited and TV picture quality is quite low (despite having an LCD TV\u2019s) -The decor may not be to everyone\u2019s liking -Location is great (on Orchard Road) though at an end of the street that is known for prostitution in the evenings which may make some visitors uneasy", "Date": "November 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "kylied", "ReviewID": "UR6051240", "Content": "This was the first stop on our round the world honeymoon and we found this hotel to be great.

The staff were unfriendly when we checked in, which was a disappointment given how luxurious the lobby is. The person who helped us was new and in training, however she failed to smile or look at us while searching for our reservation. When she couldn't find the reservation, the person she called over to help her also did not smile or look at us, and they spoke only to each other (and not in English, which was a little frustrating since I kept asking what the problem was). Fortunately, this seemed to be a fluke because all other staff members were more than friendly during our stay. We were in a standard room, which was clean, beautiful, and nicely furnished (with the exception of the bed). The beds are very hard, which made for a bad night's sleep after walking around all day touring the city. The rooms are quite small, but we were hardly there so it did not make a difference. The mini bar is nicely stocked, but expensive of course. The breakfast buffet included in the room price was large with a variety of foods to choose from. We ate breakfast there every morning and usually were not hungry for lunch. We did not try any of the other restaurants in the hotel as there is a wide selection of restaurants in the area. The location of the hotel is great! It is only a short walk to a metro station, which we found to be the easiest way to get around. Taxis are cheap (and clean and safe) as well, and the hotel is well known so it was not difficult to find a taxi driver who knew their way to it. I would not recommend booking any tours at the desk in the lobby. We were disappointed when we booked a Night Safari tour only to find we'd paid a lot more just to have a bus take us there. We could have saved about 30-40 singapore dollars if we had taken a taxi or the metro. We also did a city tour which was fun for the river boat ride part of it, but the tour mostly took us to places we had already found on our own, so again it was not worth the money. Take a taxi and ask what places they recommend seeing, or buy a travel guide and take the metro around instead. Our overall experience at the hotel was pleasurable and we would stay there again.", "Date": "October 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cClean, Comfortable, w/ wonderful Exec Lounge\u201d", "Author": "Leebot", "ReviewID": "UR5789603", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay in Singapore and this hotel was a pleasure. Yes the rooms are on the small side, but ours was attractively furnished and decorated with an Asian theme, very clean and comfortable, and most importantly -- quiet! We were in the Executive Suites though, so I can't describe the regular rooms. One of the best parts is the Executive Lounge on the top floor. It is well-staffed and the friendly attendants are helpful without being obtrusive. There is a selection of newspapers for the taking. The buffet is glorious, with all kinds of wonderful pastries, fruits, meats and smoked salmon, yogurt, cereal and even a short-order cook standing by to make your eggs however you like. One can also partake of Asian dishes here too. We ate far too much for breakfast, and in the afternoon a snack buffet is set out, and in the evening, more hors d'oueveres and snacks. The hotel itself is full of fun shops and restaurants. There is even a tailor, and one should get some custom-made clothes when visiting Singapore. There is also a pool and fitness center but we did not have a chance to visit as we were too busy sightseeing. There was also a tour coordinator located in the lobby who booked us on a sightseeing expedition to the nocturnal zoo -- transportation included and made everything so easy. My one complaint is that an open lounge area is located in the hotel lobby, with smoking permitted, so the entire lobby and adjoining cafe smells of cigarette smoke which is a real bugaboo with me; consequently we didn't spend any time there at all.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cFirst class service\u201d", "Author": "Erik2", "ReviewID": "UR5694150", "Content": "Stayed just one night as part of Singapore Airlines Stopover Program, with my wife, son, daughter in law and 2 grandchildren.
