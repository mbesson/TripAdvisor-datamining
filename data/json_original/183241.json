In fact, I look forward to it. Mine friends and I stayed for 4 nights over New Years weekend. The front desk staff was very friendly throughout our stay. The rooms are beautiful and look exactly as advertised. Breakfast is included with the stay, but we didn't make it down for breakfast. On the day we checked out, the hotel was nice enough to prepare breakfast for us to go. The location is great. The hotel is part of the tourism institute and the building sits above the Sherbrooke Metro stop. You don't need a car during your stay. Taxis are always available right in front of the hotel, and you can walk to a variety of restaurants, bars, live music spots and other attractions. If you do drive, they have onsite parking. The front desk will also exchange currency for you, but only in small amounts at a time. We arrived too late to go to a bank or exchange location, so the $50 they exchanged for us was very much appreciated. The negatives: 1) No room service. This was only an issue for us on one night. We were out late or brought back leftovers on the other nights. 2) No bell service (I don't usually use this, but I thought I'd note it.) 3) Housekeeping forgot to replace bathroom tissue 2 days in a row. We called down to the front desk when we arrived one evening and the desk clerk brought some up. 4) Although the rooms have been remodeled, the bathrooms still have old subway tile which really takes away from the \"new\" feel of the room. Overall, I recommend this hotel. The negatives were minor and would not deter me from staying again.

To give a comparison, we stayed at the Fairmont Chateau Laurier in Ottawa prior to taking a train to Montreal, and the hotel room was just as comfortable and spacious as my room in Ottawa.

Apparently a few weeks prior to our stay, Prince William and Kate took a cooking class there. http://omg.yahoo.com/news/pics-prince-william-kate-don-chef-jackets-to-take-cooking-class/66415. I guess it's a very famous cooking school as well as a hotel school. We enjoyed it because it was so quiet and intimate. They only have 40 rooms, so there's never any hustle & bustle. The staff was extremely attentive and friendly. The rooms were very well appointed -- even had an iPhone/iPod charging station. They are decorated in a modern/tech look but not over the top. The beds were extremely comfortable -- probably the best of the 5 or 7 hotels we've stayed at in the past six months. Our room (#707), like most, had a small balcony (from which we saw some of the International fireworks competition). While not cramped, it was a smaller room than most American hotel rooms. The hot & cold buffet breakfast was excellent. A good selection of pastries, cereals and fruits and juices. The croissants were really tasty and they had crepes one day and french toast another. The dining room was light & airy and the service very attentive. A couple knocks would be... a) the heavy curtains didn't block out all the light, so the sun came in from the sides, etc., in the morning. b) the flat panel TV did not carry HD channels (or none that I noticed). c) the hotel only had one elevator for guests, but since it only serviced 40 rooms on only 2 floors, it never was a problem. d) price was good but not a bargain ($225/night) In our last visit to Montreal we had stayed in the old town, which was in close walking distance to the tourist sites. This visit we did fewer tourist attractions, so the location of Hotel de l'Institut worked out well for us. It's in the heart of the so many fantastic restaurants up and down rue St Denis. It's just a few block away from a park (\u00c3\u2030tangs du Parc La Fontaine) with playgrounds, ball fields and tennis courts and pretty close to Park Mont Royal.

Cool, modern, edgy, minimalist but still welcoming.

The room was outstanding - huge bed, excellent bathroom, a balcony looking over trendy rue St-Denis and a lovely park, with distant views of church spires and Mont-Royal. Great sunset. There were a couple of odd things: the lights over the bed simply didn't respond to any attempts to make them work. They were expensive and really very attractive - but I never did work out how to turn them on. Similarly, just call me old-fashioned, but a coffee machine that has FOUR PAGES of instructions seems to be over the top! The Nespresso thing seems to be complicated just for the sake of appearing sophisticated. Breakfast is included in the price and is served by yet more trainees. The first morning we had lovely service and excellent food but the second morning really let the side down. We arrived in the dining room and stood about waiting for someone to even acknowledge our presence. There was a great deal of bustling about, people clearing tables, laying new places, taking orders, entering stuff into the computer - but no-one even made eye contact with us. Eventually after about 7 minutes, we were taken to a table by a young woman - who then proceeded to completely ignore us again. I noticed that by now there were perhaps 5 or 6 people queueing at the entrance, being similarly ignored. I managed to grab the attention of one young man and asked if we could please have some service as we had been waiting for well over 5 minutes just to be acknowledged. He mockingly asked me, 'What? Not 6 minutes? Not 7 minutes?' I wasn't impressed frankly. He then arrived with coffee, took our order and bustled off to the kitchen - or somewhere. All up, it took over half an hour from the time we arrived at the restaurant to the time when our food arrived. Something wrong with the curriculum here - it's not a good idea to teach people to completely ignore the guests and then to mock them! But this long whinge aside, this is a great little hotel, really well situated above a metro station and very close to a vast range of restaurants (although beware - a lot of them I would classify as 'strictly tourist': lovely setting, outside tables, poor service and indifferent and expensive food). I would recommend the hotel, with the proviso that the service may be patchy.", "Date": "June 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel\u201d", "Author": "moishe613", "ReviewID": "UR111010207", "Content": "The hotel was nice.

The attached restaurant is also a school and that was the most pleasant surprise. They have a daily menu for dinner that was (for us) a six course meal for what we considered an absolute bargain.
