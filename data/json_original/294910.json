Our room was on the fourth floor and was definitely one of the most depressing rooms I have stayed in my life. The only window looked out into a narrow shaft which made the air in the room extremely stuffy and ventilation almost non-existant. Furniture was old, dark and would certainly need replacing. Breakfast was quite okay though sometimes the breakfast lobby was overrun during busy times in the morning so that it was hard to find a free table. As other reviewers have remarked fresh fruit juice is an extra sold at a hefty surcharge. Location is good though - 15 to 20 minutes leisurely walk to the main attractions like Hagia Sophia or the Blue Mosque, and the tram is just a couple of minutes down the road if you don't like to walk. The worst happened when we checked out. When we had arrived from the airport we took an airport taxi which dropped us at the hotel after a twenty minute ride at a reasonable price. For our return to the airport we asked the hotel reception to organize a taxi. Although the price they gave us was way above what we had paid for the airport taxi we accepted as it was the convenient option. It turned out that the \"taxi\" was a shuttle bus which was supposed to take six other people as well. To our amazement the driver drove us round the hotel only to stop in front of it after ten minutes declaring that he wouldn't drive us to the hotel. After our complaints the people at the reception promised to call another driver who finally drove eight people to the airport in his minibus, dropping some of his buddies on the way. From what we know from friends you will get much better value elsewhere in Istanbul - and if you insist on this place make sure you're not put into a dump like our room.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYou can find much better for the price.

The plants in the Lobby are plastic and not clean, the concierge is a desk in the lobby. Gym is a very small room as part of the \"spa\" and has 3 machines from the 70s, it is not open most of the day and costs about 10 dollars a day if you choose to work out/ injure yourself in it. There were cracks in the rooms wall, the tv had about 10 channels to choose from and it was probably the first edition of the flat screens. The view of our suit was a brunt down building on one side and a small park surranded by run down buildings ( as bad as shanghai's residentials) on the other Side.The bar was very small and very poor selection of drinks and very overpriced! There is only two elevators in the hotel and they are very small, only two people can fit in them, one if you have luggage. The furniture is very old and the decores are very tacky and cheap. Food quality is terrible and the breakfast buffet is limited and not fresh. If you want fresh juice you need to pay for it extras and it is called the vitamin bar, what a joke. Front desk staff were not very friendly, the manager told us he had to hold our passport because their computer system is down? Now I travel about two to three times a year internationally and I know some hotels hold passports to make sure they get paid especially in third world countries but I had already pre paid for our room and breakfast, and their computer didn't have a problem checking us in!!! The only good thing about the hotel is its distance to old town tourist sites but so are 100s of other hotels. For an American chain of hotel this was a complete disaster on all accounts, I am very disappointed and will never stay at a best western hotel, senator or not. Here is another hint, if the four stars is part of the name banner outside, it does not make a four star hotel... The irony to the situation is that I paid the same amount of money for the first part of the trip in a hotel at taqsim square and it was an amazing experience!!", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, RJ", "Title": "\u201cBye Bye Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "JOAO S", "ReviewID": "UR122405436", "Content": "I went to Turkey for a tour for some cities.

After enquiring about the airport shuttle before departure I was told it would be 20\u00e2\u201a\u00ac to get to the hotel (roughly the same price as a normal taxi). The hotel is well situated but it is not in the best location as it's on a side street. The staff are on the whole very helpful and polite. They are very helpful with local knowledge and information - which was greatly appreciated. The bar was quite highly priced (31lira for a small bottle of white wine) but it was one of the only places where you could find alcohol easily. Room was \"OK\". We had a triple room and it turned out to be 3 single beds. Our view was nothing spectacular (the back of the hotel) but it was quiet. One of the sheets had a rip in it - something that i wouldnt expect from a 4* hotel - but when i spoke to the cleaner - it was replaced immediately - again an example of the fantastic staff that they have here. The biggest \"issue\" for me was the lack of a free gym. You had to pay 10\u00e2\u201a\u00ac each time you wanted to use it. This again was something that amazed me a little bit (especially as they advised against running outside). The Hammam looked lovely and the lady on the reception there was very helpful about what they offered and the availability. Breakfast was ok -but the eggs were substandard on two of the three days (hard boiled eggs that were running, or you could not crack off the shells). The potatoes were often cold but the bread and pastries were lovely and fresh.

In my experience, this hotel was perfectly acceptable. The location is quite good. It is a longish walk to Grand Bazaar (about 15 minutes) but it is entirely doable and a straight shot down the main road. If you are not up for walking, you can take the tram, which is conveniently located close to the hotel. I can see how the walk might be an issue for less fit/older guests/kids, but if you are in good shape, the walk is not bad at all. The rooms are clean and our room, which faced the back, didn't have a great view but we were not in Istanbul to appreciate the view out of our hotel room! We were there during Ramadan and could hear the call to prayer, but it was not loud or bothersome. The breakfast buffet is quite nice too. It doesn't change, but there is a wide variety of breads, cheeses, olives, tomatoes, cucumber, yogurts, granola, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages etc in addition to tea/coffee and juices. If you go in expecting some fantastic culinary experience then you are sure to be disappointed. But as far as buffet breakfasts go, this one was just fine. The one unexpected and pleasant find was a small restaurant across the street--can't remember the exact name but it is Laleli Kebap or something similar. We had dinner there two nights; they are open late (we sat down to eat at 11 PM one night) so it is a convenient option if you have a flight that arrives late.
