It's fairly clean, although there was a wee bit of an unusual fragrance in the bathroom area on arrival (sorted by the cleaners the next morning), the room is average-sized for a hotel in Paris, and the amenities are very modern, with an iPod dock, a mobile-style room phone, and a wall-mounted flat-screen tv with a myriad of channels. What makes the Sezz different to any hotel we've stayed at before is the rather open-plan bathroom layout. Simply, there is clear glass the length of the divide between the sleeping area and the bathroom area. Translated, that means that you shower/bath in full view of whoever else you share a room with... Now, if that's your girlfriend, that's no big problem at all, but if you're with another relative or a friend who's a bit shy about their body, then it could be a real issue... As regards the room, it was done in a grey brick (mock brick?) design that carried through into the bathroom. There was a sofa built in beneath the tv, which acted as the spot to leave bags, and a desk occupied the space behind the headboard, complete with a few glossy magazines/books, and the usual pen and writing pad. The rest of the decor wasn't too hard on the eyes, and looked in a reasonable state, although the lighting in the room is a little on the dark side. We didn't bother to eat in the hotel, as breakfast was 28 euros per person, and there were perfectly good (cheaper and tasty!) alternatives in the Trocadero area, which is a five-minute walk from Rue Fremiet, where the Sezz is located. There is a spa in the hotel, which is free, but again we didn't avail as we were only in Paris for 6 days, so we were on the move for most of the day. Concerning the staff, they were friendly enough, the cases brought to the room, no problems with the check-in or check-out, and were for the most part unobtrusive, with the odd \"bonjour\" thrown in. The main plus point about the Sezz is the location. It is very close to the Eiffel Tower/Trocadero area, and the Passy metro station is just a minute away (out of the hotel, turn left, and left onto the main road, and look for the steps up and the metro sign). Passy is on one of the main metro lines that takes you directly to the Champs Elysees... Overall, we would recommend the Sezz, however there could be better deals pricewise for what you get, as for a few of the in-room amenities, you do have to pay, for example, a designer candle... In addition, there are a few surprise items lurking in a drawer attached to the bed... One of them being a double-ended lollypop...

I called the hotel directly to book and asked them if I need to book for a previous night as well, as I would be arriving at 8 am. They checked their bookings and assured me that they would do their best to accomodate my early check in request. The personal assitant e-mailed me a couple of times to ask if needed any help with restaurant reservations and also arranged for a pick up car at the airport. So I was already impressed with the service, before I even stepped foot into the hotel. The check in process was the most welcoming experience I have ever had. Yann, my incredible personal assistant bounded out the door and minute my car arrived, and asked me to make myself confortable in their lounge, while he collected my passport. Within minutes, I was served a complimentary expresso, a crossaint and a madeline! Yann then proceded to deposit my bags in my room, and check it out before he invited me to follow him. Despite my 9 am arrival, I was shown to my room immediately. I had a suite on the 2nd floor - a living room with a separate bed room. It had ample closet space, a very nice desk area, and a sunny sitting area with huge windows. The bed was super comfortable and along one wall was the big, big bathroom. And yes, its see through. Though the loo is very private. So you need to be prepared for that. I was taken care of superbly by Yann and the rest of the staff. They really made me feel that \"no request was too much\" and proceded to accomodate me with such enthusiasm that I was ready with my next request in no time :) The restaurants recommended by Yann were just spot on, I had some incredible meals thanks to the hotel. The morning breakfast spread is fresh and ample. Room service was extremely quick and efficient. Treat yourself to a morning expresso everyday! One of the best things I liked about the hotel was its location. Its steps away from the Siene and the Eiffel Tower, so you get to see her at all hours of the day. And just behind the hotel, is a real Paris neighbourhood, with its cafes and little shops giving you an immediate respite from anything remotely touristy. If you are a young at heart couple and like your decor modern, your service invisible but efficient, the Sezz is modern luxury at its best. My only regret is that I was too busy to try the hamam!

We got a half price deal, but it was still quite pricey, so I was expecting something pretty exciting. On the positive side, the location is quiet, the hotel newly fitted out in the trendy way you'd expect from a 'boutique' hotel, even if the overall effect was a bit 'cold' for my taste. A bit of effort and the place could really merit a five out of five. Areas where improvement is needed - My main complaint is that the bathroom in our room offered no privacy. Although you can't actually see the person who's sitting on the toilet, you can see their legs, see them getting up, etc. You are also in full view when in the shower or at the washbasin. This seems idiotic to me - I don't want to have to hide under the duvet or consciously turn away while my other half is in the bathroom. Perhaps this set up appeals to some people - it didn't appeal to me. The AC in the room was noisy at times and you couldn't adjust the temperature. We found the room too cold at times. To be fair, we didn't complain about this at the time, so maybe it could have been fixed. Breakfast was a shambles. Tables next to ours weren't cleared up, so we sat there having breakfast next to someone else's half-eaten croissants. The scrambled eggs and omelettes we ordered really weren't very nice at all. The hotel seems to pride itself on assigning you a 'Personal Assistant' rather than having someone at reception. The PAs are dressed in a strange uniform that makes them look like they are wearing pyjama tops - not very stylish or professional looking. The PAs are all very nice and speak ok English, but they came across more like students than people who were particularly knowledgeable or confident. One PA recommended we take the RER to a particular destination, only for us to find out, too late, that it wasn't actually running The jacuzzi and steam room downstairs were good when you consider the location. We were a bit surprised to see one of the PAs coming in for a shower though. I don't want to sound pretentious, but it's unusual to be sharing washing facilities with the staff.

The hotel street is really quiet and from the window we can see the river Seine and from the street see the Eiffel Tower and reach it within 10min walk! There is also a metro station just 2 min walk from the hotel which is very convenient. Hotel is small which makes it very personal, so the breakfast area is small and the breakfast itself is lovely! The fact that the hotel is pretty new(only 5yrs) makes it a little unknown to the taxi drivers, they never know where it is, or where is that street. The only thing that at first disappointed a little was that me and my fianc\u00e9, who were celebrating our anniversary, had massages booked, but unfortunately we couldnt have it together, and when we got to the room we understood why: it was too small!!

I asked for a discount (which I was not given when I checked out) and I didn't follow up on that because, to be honest, I didn't want to end up having the argument that would inevitably have followed. Not having the rooms ready is unaccceptable in any hotel (it is part of the contract after all) and in a hotel charging this much?

The bed itself was very comfortable. Storage overall wasn't great. There was a limited amount of space to store things if they weren't on hangers, and there was nowhere to hide the suitcases.

Also the decoration of the hotel, design for sure, is a bit cold. Something is missing to get a real 4star service level, but It's just a strange feeling, nothing concret as a hair drier missing. It's a kind of experience for people found of design and grey colour.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWhat a lovely hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Julia032", "ReviewID": "UR56374783", "Content": "My fiance and I have just come back from a three day stay at the Sezz Hotel and are absolutely delighted.

Your comfort is the utmost of importance at hotel Sezz, from the moment you enter the hotel. You are greeted at the entrance by your personal assistant (who is the person you call on for whatever you need during your stay) and led to a comfy seating area (no formal reception desk in sight) where you are offered a glass of champagne and a chance to relax before being given your check in form to check and sign. You are then left to finish your drink in peace and take in your surroundings before being escorted to your room. The hotel is contemporary and modern without being cold and unwelcoming. Yes it is small but they have used the space well and it makes everything that much more intimate. THE ROOM ----------------- What can I say - it was amazing. Like I mentioned before the hotel is small - so the only thing anyone can complain about is the size of the room - but in our case we loved it - so small and intimate, how much space does a couple need? You walk into your room, all very modern and contemporary, ipod dock on the desk, a flat screen TV buried in an alcove across from your bed, a gorgeous large bed in the middle of the room, a love seat in the alcove opposite the bed, French window doors that open out onto the tiny Parisian street the hotel is located on. You're so taken in by the beauty of the room that it takes you a while to realise you can\u2019t see the ensuite bathroom. It is then that your personal assistant flicks a light switch and you see that what you thought was a mirrored wall was actually the glass wall of your bathroom (which had been in complete darkness before). That's when you take in the sight of the amazing Japanese style stone bath and the rest of the gorgeous bathroom. We loved it - especially the long soaks in the bath that was more than big enough for two :o) STAFF ---------- Like I mentioned before there is no reception desk per se like they have in other hotels. Instead the staff are tucked away in a small room but they seem to magically appear the moment you enter the hotel lobby :o) The thing that really sets Hotel Sezz apart from the rest is it's fantastic staff. My fianc\u00e9 and I have stayed in many 5* hotels in our time and have found that some staff tend to be too formal and cold and can even sometimes look down their noses at you (I don't know if this has anything to do with our age and casual style or just something about us - LOL). The staff at Hotel Sezz could not be more different - they are all welcoming, friendly and professional without any airs and graces about them. They actually all seem to enjoy working there and are truly happy to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. My fianc\u00e9 proposed to me in our hotel room and the staff had been more than accommodating and helpful - at my fianc\u00e9's request they had arranged to get fresh rose petals laid out in a heart shape on the bed and champagne in our room before we returned from a perfect day in Paris and my fianc\u00e9 popped the question :o) FOOD --------- Breakfast is served in a small room with about 4/5 tables and a wonderful glass ceiling. It is a buffet continental breakfast service with lovely little pastry's, croissants, pain au chocolats, cheeses, hams, yoghurts, fresh fruit and cereals. It's quiet and intimate with no one rushing you along - you are free to sit there and enjoy a leisurely breakfast reading the newspapers (if you so wish).. On our first night we were tired and asked the hotel if they could recommend a good restaurant nearby. They pointed us towards a little French restaurant which was a 5 minute walk away \u2013 it was lovely. One night we didn't fancy going out for dinner and were craving a lazy night in with some Pizza (I know what you are thinking - all that fine French cuisine around us and we wanted Pizza) snuggled in our gorgeous room with some DVDs (borrowed from the selection at the front desk). There didn't seem to be any pizza on the room service menu so we spoke to the man on duty at the front desk and he offered to order us a Pizza from the local Domino's and have it delivered to our room. Room service choice was good (it even had sushi), all the food was well presented and tasty. Also for all you chocolate lovers out there - there is a Lenotre store a 5 minute walk from the hotel down avenue au president Kennedy - their cakes and pastries are to die for :o) LOCATION ---------------- For us the location was great as it was out of the way in a quiet part of Paris, which for others may not be ideal. It is located a short walk away from the Eiffel Tower and the Passy metro station is literally around the corner from the hotel so we had no problems getting around and seeing the sites :o) We are the kind of couple who like small boutique hotels - small (in number of rooms) and intimate being the most important to us. In Paris there are many large luxury hotels that would suit others better. However, if you are after small, contemporary, boutique, intimate and friendly then this is definitely the place for you.

I loved the location of Hotel Sezz in a quiet corner of the 16eme arr. in Paris, but conveniently located near a Metro stop and a short walk across the river from the Tour Eiffel. We felt that we were retreating to our quiet home after a long day of wandering, shopping, and whatever else we got up to. The hotel itself was clean and the room very \"design\", but comfortable. I enjoyed the \"fireplace\" as we entered, which added warmth to an otherwise fairly stark atmosphere. We took advantage of the HUGE two-person tub in our room on the 7th floor and enjoyed the provided robes and slippers afterwards. The Kiehl's toiletries were wonderful. The bed was comfortable, but a bit hard for my taste, and the springs squeaked loudly from time to time. The curtains were a gorgeous heavy fabric that helped us sleep in by blocking out all light. One thing I did notice was a lot of noise from our neighbors, both as they entered their room (noise from the door) and as they talked (at seemingly normal levels) in their room. As we didn't spend a lot of time in our room, the bother was minimal. Everything in the ground floor Veuve Cliquot bar is overpriced, and we only once saw anyone sitting there sipping champange (they were hotel guests), but breakfast was served in the same room and we enjoyed the large skylights and comfortable booths. Breakfast was good, though twice my request for a cooked egg was ignored or forgotten until we had already finished eating. The basement hammam was lovely, peaceful, and quiet, though the water temperature of the small pool was too cool. We had massages arranged by the hotel with the best masseuse I've ever had. And the entire hammam area was reserved for us privately while we had our massages. This was luxurious. My impression of the hotel was marred by the hit-or-miss service provided by the hotel's concierges. There was one gentleman who provided excellent, timely responses to our requests, and yet with all the others we were left waiting, sometimes for over an hour, for a response to our requests. By email in advance of our trip we made several requests, only to have the people on duty when we arrived to claim no knowledge of what we had already discussed (plans for dinner, etc). They claim to provide one-on-one concierge services for guests throughout their stay, but we must have spoken with at least five different people throughout our stay - and had to fill in the new person with what had already been requested or discussed.

I personally love hotels that are smaller, stylish and a little different from the usual. Hotel Sezz certainly fits all three. Unfortunately, what it doesn't fit are any criteria regarding convenient location, knowlegeable staff, and nearby good places for breakfast. The room we stayed in (42) was fabulous. The bathroom took up one whole side of the room separated from the bed area by a floor to ceiling glass wall - toilet was around the corner, hidden from view if you were wondering. The shower was incredible. It was a limestone-lined square japanese-style tub (that we used as such) with a rain shower head. The sink, although very stylish, was not very practical. Bed was comfortable. Room decor, like the hotel, was of high quality. However, the problems. 1. As previously stated by many other guests, the location is very inconvenient for anyone wanting to see more than the 16th. The hotel has only one metro stop nearby that is actually not very well connected to the other lines (a rarity in Paris). Yes, it is only a 10-15 min walk to the Eiffel Tower but, really, who wants to go there to be smothered by tourists and gizmo salesmen when there are so many other beautiful sights to be seen? 2. The staff. Every one was extremely nice and personable. However, their helpfulness and success in filling the 'concierge' role (something you should expect for this type and cost of hotel) have a lot of room for improvement. For example, they could not think of any good restaurants we could go to (even with our suggestion of where we wanted to go - the Joel Robuchon restaurants), did not ask to help with reservations, their suggestion of a breakfast place lead us to a restaurant only open for lunch etc etc. In the end, we ended up going back to our 'tried and true' places we knew from previous trips (booked by us) - a diasppointment from such a nice, hip boutique hotel. Small, hip places tend to attract a clientele that likes similar things in restaurants and bars. Cater to your demographic! 3. The 'champagne bar', comprising a few tables and chairs that, when you could actually flag down someone working there, you could sit at and drink your 15euro glass of champagne. No thanks. We could buy ourselves a bottle and stare at each other drinking in our fabulous room instead. In the end, in a city like Paris, where there are so many fabulous small boutique hotels in more active parts of the city for similar cost, I kicked myself for booking in at the Sezz. I'm not usually one to obsess or be concerned about spending money on nice hotels but I found myself thinking about what I could have gotten elsewhere (d'Aubusson for example) for the same price.

We were there a total of 6 nights and were primarily focused on seeing a few museums, doing a little shopping, and mainly enjoying the fabulous Parisian restaurants and cafes. We travel extensively for both pleasure and business, and tend to prefer stylish boutique hotels like Sezz over \"grand dames\" like Crillon or Meurice. Some of our favorites over the years have been the Morrison Hotel in Dublin, the Mandarin Oriental in both San Francisco and New York, Luxe11 in Berlin, and the Metropolitan in Bangkok. Regarding Hotel Sezz, I would concur with everything the previous reviewer wrote, so I won't reiterate those points, but rather add a few pluses and minuses of my own: 1. Location. The 16th is definitely off the radar for most tourists, which is a blessing and a curse. We quickly found our breakfast spot at the Cafe Passy on the intersection of rue Passy and av B. Franklin, about 5 minutes' walk above the hotel. In fact, this area had all the services one might require, including a dry cleaners, pharmacy, several restaurants, etc. The only issue is that you must climb a fairly steep flight of stairs at the head of ave Fremiet to get to that part of Passy. There is also a fun cafe/bar just under the bridge on ave Kennedy below the Passy metro stop on ave Kennedy that was just minutes from the hotel. In addition, it's an easy 20-30 minute walk from the hotel to the Trocadero via ave Franklin, and then on to ave Montaigne for shopping in one of Paris's finest areas. So, though the 16th is maybe a little far afield for some, it is still a fine neighborhood and a good choice if you want to be away from the tourist ghettos on the left bank or around the Louvre. For most people, I suspect the biggest downside to the 16th is that you must take the metro to get to most of the main tourist attractions in the city. I happen to love trains and subways, so this isn't a downside for me. My wife and I invested in a 7 day metro/bus pass (cost: 16E/person) at the RTF kiosk across from the Tourist Information kiosk at Gare du Nord and we were set for the week. After a couple of days spent getting to know the various lines, we were navigating the metro like old pros. One last caveat about the location, though. It is a tough trip from Gare du Nord to the Passy metro stop if you have large bags. There are lots of steps and not many escalators in the metro, so seriously consider the 20E taxi ride from the train station as a back-saving alternative. 2. The hotel \"amenities.\" We loved the concierges and found them extremely helpful, but some of the marketing materials are really misleading. Since I'd read about the champagne bar/breakfast nook, I wasn't terribly disappointed in the Grand Dame. However, I did think that a few people might be around the \"bar\" for New Years, since it is supposedly a Veuve Clicquoit-sponsored establishment. They should really try a little harder to do something with the bar, since it would be a nice addition to the hotel. Both my wife and I are gym people, so we were really disappointed that the nearest gym facility was 3 metro stops away and costs 30 E per day per person! Yikes!! I made due with running the stairs a couple of times, doing situps and pushups, and skipping rope. On the other hand, we used the hotel's DVD library several times and found it a lifesaver on the one night that we came in early after an exhausting day of tramping around the Marais in cold, overcast weather. 3. The bed and the bath. I found the bed to be particularly comfortable. So much so that I had trouble getting up on the colder mornings of our stay! The bath, a huge circular double tub, was used by one or the other (or both) of us 4 nights out of 6. It was the perfect thing for relaxing after a long winters' day of touring, shopping and dining. 4. The \"Look.\" As I'd mentioned earlier, we tend to prefer boutique hotels like Sezz for our travels, so the high design aspect really worked for us. I can easily see how some would find it a little cold or too spare. However, the staff seems to really go out of their way to make you comfortable and welcome. All in all, I'd definitely stay at Sezz on my next trip to Paris.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Global Traveller", "Title": "\u201cSezz Who\u201d", "Author": "CharlieLondon", "ReviewID": "UR6320292", "Content": "I was really disappointed with my stay here. When I booked I had booked a rate including breakfast and when I checked in the girl said it was NOT included. When I checked out several days later the bill showed it was included. As it was already a discounted rate there wasn't anything they were willing to do. As far as butler service??? That's just a ridiculas statement! The girl who checked me in was new and didn't know how anything worked (ex booking the spa, how to turn on the lights to show me the spa, the wireless internet.... on and and on. She also didn't know the immediate area for ATM, bakery, market etc.... For this type of hotel and price they really should have had her accompanied by someone who knew what they were doing. I eventually asked her to go get someone because I was sick of hearing \"I don't know\". They didn't say sorry, quite the opposite. They acted like how dare I disturb them. The hotel is definately stylish, but dark and when looking closer it's very tired. The \"spa\" however was amazing. It's not really a spa in the traditional way. If you want massage you need to book 3 days in advance because no one is actually on staff that does it. If your only staying 3 days guess your out of luck! lol When you book the 'spa area' you get it all to yourself and there is a beautiful stone jacuzzi, showers with huge shower heads and a steam room. Just incredible. I've been to Paris many times and every neighborhood is different and like I said it was a huge disappointment to stay somewhere where they didn't seem to know much about where and how to go... And like the other reviewer said the standard room was so TINY. (Fair enough, it' s Paris, but it was not like the pictures at all). Yes I know the website is to entice, but this one is totally misleading. Location was good because it's 2 minutes walk to the metro, so I didn't understand why people wrote it wasn't good. There are also lots of nice shops/bakeries very close by. The bar they mentioned makes the place sound hip, but it was always empty and the time I did decide to have a glass of champage I had to track someone down to order it.

Don't be fooled by the pictures on the hotel website however as it gives the impression that all rooms have the glass fronted bathroom and the bed artisticly placed in the midlle of the room etc. Our room was a standard double which although the cheapest of the rates - was substantially expensive! The room is well designed, very modern but a lot smaller than I was led to believe from any of the photos on the website. The bed however was huge and the wall-mounted LCD television and dvd player were great touches. The bathroom also was smaller than any of the website photos but still beautifully designed with some very unique finishes. The bathrobes however, god knows what happened there! they look as if someone had put them in the tumble dryer for 5 hours, both of them were so small. We stayed for 3 nights and we treated ourselves to continental breakfast on the final day hoping to keep hunger at bay for our travel home! Seriously not worth the money - 50 euros for 2!!! we got 2 boiled eggs, a small basket of very small pastries and a bruised apple and a bruised orange, oh and tea with hot milk! not exactly a lot to keep the hunger pangs at bay. I would defnitely save your money and go and find a nice cafe! we also ordered room service one night as we were going on a tour to the moulin rouge (definitely worth a vist) we booked through a link on the Eurostar website which is then booked through Paris Vision) Anway the room service is pretty mediocre. Warmed up microwave meals, which is fair enough seeing as the hotel doesn't have a restaurant, but at 15 euros a plate is a little inflated for what you get! All in all, definitely a hotel worth visiting, it's one of the most uniquely designed hotels I've ever visited and it's in a great location just round the corner from the Passy Metro which is handy for getting everywhere in Paris.

This Hotel is absolutely phenomenal. However if you are not into Contemporary design or small boutique hotels then it is probably not the right choice for yourself. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff who showed us into the sleek champagne bar and gave us our complimentary champagne. We were then given a phone which we could use 24 hours if we needed any help what so ever. Our room was exceptional, A double bed in the middle of the room, plasma TV with a bathroom divided by a glass window and door (don't worry the toilet is tucked away to keep privacy). The bath is a double bath as well. Each room in the hotel is different. Our room was room 22. If you call the hotel you can request them to keep a room of your choice available. We asked to have a tour of the other rooms. We saw the Eiffel tower suite, but the room was not a lot different from ours other than the view of the tower. If you are wanting a view of the Tower then this room is superb, but if you are looking for a larger room for the extra money then do not book the suite as it is near enough the same size. The room below 65 was a standard double and had a view of the tower through the roofs which would be a better option. This Hotel is tucked down a side street. It is a stones throw from the Eiffel Tower and really conveniently located. We spent one evening in the hotel. The staff bent over backwards to help us. They ordered us take away as we were far to tired to sit in a restaurant, were giving us souvenirs to take home, they really bent over backwards to make us feel welcome. This Hotel is ideal if you are looking for a quiet hotel to escape to after a busy day sightseeing in London. This Hotel is an excellent Boutique hotel.

We had booked a suite at some considerable cost for both a Friday and Saturday night expecting to have a room with a semi roof top view as described on the website and booking form, this was unfortunately not the case. All we had was an enclosed courtyard to look out on, which would have been fine if we had been expecting that. We arrived at around 10pm and were looking forward to relaxing and ordering some room service. There was only one member of staff on call for the whole hotel that night, and for such an expensive boutique hotel this seemed rather inadequate. We tried to order room service from the menu provided but were told at 1015 that half the menu was unavailable as it was too late to order (the cut off time stated was 1030pm). We were forced to order from the 24hr menu, which on the whole looked fine.

He eventually brought our food up after explaining that it would take some time for him to prepare?! When the food arrived it was still in the cardboard microwave containers!!! This was totally unacceptable presentation and 3 microwave pasta dishes for 45 euros was bordering on ridiculous. The robes in the room were totally below standard also. They didn\u2019t match and one was so small it was like a child\u2019s. The dvd player was stored in a separate room to the TV and could only be accessed via opening the wardrobe. The bath wasn\u2019t big enuff for two people as stated on the website, and those are not marble sinks you see in the pictures, they are plastic. Having said all that, the shower was extremely good and was easily the best feature in the bathroom. Over all this experience has put me off going back to Sezz.
