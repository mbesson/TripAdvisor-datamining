Tucked away in a side street but only two minutes walk from San Marco, this is a quiet hotel. Warm, friendly welcome and very helpful people. The room was large and spotlessly clean - good, crisp bed linen which which was changed daily. The bathroom was newly refurbished, spotlessly clean with a good shower. The breakfast area is small, only 3 tables, and a bit of a tight squeeze, however, the breakfast choices were good. All in all a very positive experience.

The room and bathroom were nice and clean and the bed was reasonably comfortable, and they have a nice coffee machine at breakfast. The amount paid for the room I think is a little high concidering this time of the year, and there supposed to be a central AC unit but I dont think it was running even though the weather was a bit warm during the day, but thats ok. Also, the bread selection and cheese at breakfast can be better. I do recommend this hotel and I would not mind staying there again.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "wilmington", "Title": "\u201cNice room, nice location\u201d", "Author": "mjacobs", "ReviewID": "UR119006005", "Content": "We were happy with the room and the location. They now offer to bring breakfast to your room if you feel crowded in the breakfast room which I thought was a nice touch. The owner is only there part of the time so if you want someone there to ask questions- make sure you catch her when you see her.

The owner Esther is very helpful and efficient and the morning breakfast is helpful to the budget (although the breakfast room is ridiculously small and serving breakfast only from 8 not useful for tourists who want to get out there early). My one big warning with this place though is that if, as I did, you book a quad room do not expect to get two double beds or even a double and two full singles- instead what you get is a double and two roll-aways not acceptable at all for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac220 per night I felt.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Fl", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location; Nice rooms and service\u201d", "Author": "gabz323", "ReviewID": "UR35255224", "Content": "Locanda Cavanella is about 5 min from the San Marco water taxi stop. The location in regards to the tourist sightseeing is amazing! We had a quadruple room which was very spacious. The owners were nice and helpful. The breakfast was a buffet- ham, cheese, yogurt, bread, cereals, etc. which was very good. They also make you cappuccinos, lattes, etc. The breakfast area is not very large though, so depending on how many people are staying at the hotel, you might have to wait for a table to sit at to eat. It is a little pricey though (we went during high season), but I am not sure what it compares to other hotels. We booked it on www.booking.com and paid 315 Euros for two nights (for 4 people, with breakfast and private bath).", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cToo hard to find Casa Cavanella\u201d", "Author": "cheryllow", "ReviewID": "UR6766566", "Content": "I had reserved 1 night at Casa Cavanella in Venice on the 28/01/07, that was booked through LateRooms.com. However my hotel confirmation does not state that check in is NOT at Casa Cavanella itself but at Hotel Al Leon - this is only written in Italian (although the rest of the confirmation is in English and I cannot read Italian) - this made it extremely frustrating when I turned up at Casa Cavanella just after 12:30pm at night (the map provided on LateRooms.com is simply too general considering the maze of alleyways in Venice, and even the 5 locals we approached, including a policeman, had never heard of the street Calle Cavanella) to find a notice on the front door with a poorly drawn map indicating directions to Hotel Al Leon. I tried to contact Casa Cavanella twice on the phone number provided around 11pm at 0412770393 but the calls went unanswered. As it had already taken me 1.5 hours to locate Casa Cavanella , I was not prepared to try to find Hotel Al Leon as well in the middle of the night. Therefore I ended up having to pay for another room at nearby Hotel Ca' Del Campo but so much more worth it as reception was open 24 hours and staff was extremely professional and helpful. My advice for potential guests is to get a detailed map and directions from the hotel showing every little alleyway and also directions on how to get to Hotel Al Leon for check in!", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Locanda Cavanella", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d564338-Reviews-Locanda_Cavanella-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$125 - $237*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Cavanella 4483</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "564338", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9d/e8/9de86baa1da5ac26eab45b7ff58b78bc6large.jpg"}}
