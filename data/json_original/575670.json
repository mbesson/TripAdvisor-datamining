There are better hotels in Mayaguez but none so close to midtown. The other two better hotels are located just off the highway near nothing of importance. I've read the other reviews which are a bit dated. The main difference is there no manhole or reconstruction taking place anywhere nearby nor is there any complimentary breakfast nearby. Here are the Pros and Cons: Pros: Just a block away from the Town Plaza, Not noisy at all, Helpful staff, Best Value for your money Cons: You get what you pay for, Complimentary breakfast is weak, Pool only 3'6\" deep. Apx., 20' X 20' wide. very small Restaurant and dining area very weak. [Breakfast should still be obtained at bakery across the street to the right at your expense. (in my opinion)] Parking is available; A small block away but its also a public parking as well. (The cost of parking will added on to your bill at check out.) Night life is dull in the immediate area. The Bar is \"OK\", the restaurant is not worth even mentioning. Occasional panhandling surounds the exterior area of the hotel and parking. Parking is not so expensive but is usually at or above capacity during business hours. Despite the cons mentioned above it is worth the value. Recommendations: (A) You'll want the parking. You have to give them a card when you leave and obtain a card when you park (a bit backwards). Its worth it so accept all the dilemma and it will make it easier. (B) Most anywhere you travel you'll have panhandling. Its an international vacationing fact. Most Panhandlers aren't threatening Anything no more than 25 - 50 cents is usually enough. Pre-count your change at the hotel. Always have some in hand and make sure you keep your quarters in one pocket and the rest in another. You choose which pocket to pick from. (C) unless you enjoy a simple meal for one, avoid eating at the hotel. it is a clean area but not made for family dining. Dining area is by the lobby and front desk so you decide. My advice, enjoy the bakery nearby and/or any restaurant in town. Vicinity locations to be aware (as you step out of hotel): Ricomini bakery. -to the right of Hotel Corner shop, bikinis taylor made fit -to the left Rex Cream. Chinese churned ice cream (try Maiz flavor with cinnamon) -front of parking. Marine World, Local surf and beach clothing store. -across street from Rex cream, past parking (Same street) Cathedral, Town Plaza & City Hall. Behind and to the right of Hotel. Free Trolley Ride - To the right of City Hall Finally- for a real shopping experience try -Mayaguez Mall (Mayaguez South), -Mayaguez Shopping Center [2nd floor (Near Town University)], -Mayaguez North Mall (Near local airport off Hwy Rt. # 2) all shopping areas mentioned above have ample parking and less than a 20 min. drive. Mayaguez Mall has the most to offer but if you want to enjoy a movie try any of the other two. [For NEW movie releases at $6.50 a pop that's quite a bargain (in english for the most part)] None of the other better hotels can say they have so much, so close. If staying in Mayaguez and not planning to leave the hotel much stay at the better ones.

We paid $85 a night. The television was resting on the desk in front of the bed so there is not a lot of space to put items you would normally leave on a desk at your hotel. The furniture is cedarwood (I think) and creates a nice smell. Mayaguez is a great jumping off point for the western part of the island. We stayed here and made day trips to Cabo Rojo, Boqueron, La Parguera and Rincon. I wish we had more than a couple of days. The building itself is very nice, the rooms all sit inside of an open walkway. They do offer a continental breakfast with the bakery across the street which is sparse but we still got a good breakfast there under $5. Be advised, the breakfast tortilla on the menu is actually an omelet. The restaurant also serves lunch and dinner dishes a la carte and is very busy with locals througout the day. Ladies if you have the chance and the time, there is shop up the block owned by a designer who makes custom bathing suits starting at about $70. The pool and pool area are very small. We did experience more panhandling than in San Juan. If you're concerned about theft there is a security guard posted at the hotel 24 hrs and they do have secure fencing around the building gates. There is a guest laundry but the dryer doesn't work very well.
