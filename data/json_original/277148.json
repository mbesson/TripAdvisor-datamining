The room was clean, spacious, fully carpeted. The bathroom had a nice size, and was equipped with hairdryer, augmentation mirror (which my wife loved), bathtub, and plenty of towels, which was good. The hotel staff was always helpful and helped a lot with directions and tips. the breakfast was good, but with a buffet composed with 90% of sweets, wich obliged us to do some shopping in the grocery store around the corner in order to eat something salty on the breakfast, but this was not a big deal. the property is placed a few blocks away from subway, and have a nice cantina and a gelatteria (for ice cream) next to it, at the street corner.

The rooms are comfortable and very functional - my only complaint with the appearance is the unattractive bedspreads. I can see how they're easier to keep clean, but the fabric is really ugly and almost feels like vinyl. Not a big deal, but an eyesore. The bed was surprisingly comfortable, the thermostat worked and noise was not a problem overlooking the street on the first floor. The entire hotel seemed clean and well-maintained. I found the staff to be VERY helpful and friendly. The breakfast is okay as long as your idea of breakfast is breads/sweets, cereal, yogurt, fruit, juice and coffee. Any kind of meat or cheese is extra and expensive. My only hesitation about saying I'd definitely stay here again is the location. It is a short, safe 10 minute walk to the metro, and lots of great places to eat and shop are therefore easily accessible. However, I found the neighborhood restaurants to be very unaccommodating. I wanted to have dinner at the local place they recommended, but no one seemed to speak English and I don't speak enough Italian to function. I ended up going to more touristy areas for meals even though I would have happily eaten near the hotel. It's a very residential area of the city, which can be a good thing, but if you want to eat dinner at 7pm and you don't speak Italian, you may find it challenging. Overall, it's a really good value and if you're spending very little time at the hotel I'd highly recommend it. If you aren't comfortable with depending on the subway to get to places you want to go, you might want to spend more for a hotel closer to the attractions - the neighborhood businesses will be in a much better position to cater to foreigners. If you're not sure what the subway entails... it's very easy to figure out, each trip on it is one euro (or four euros for use all day), and your visit to Rome will be much more manageable if you invest 10 minutes in learning how to do it.

The hotel experience was not as nice. This poor review is mainly due to the checkin process. I had sent a few emails back and forth before coming to Rome. I was assured to a single large bed. Upon arrival I was told there were no large beds. I assured him of the many emails stating the contrary. In fact I had the date of the last email that had confirmed this. He looked back and found it. I did end up getting the single large bed, but at the expense of being told I was mistaken and blown off. In addition, there was a leak in the shower that was getting the entire floor wet.

The front desk should be able to direct you to it; we found those at the front desk extremely helpful. The rooms are standard for a European hotel - two single beds attached as a double, with a medium sized room and bathroom.

If you don't mind walking to the train station then this hotel will be fine, it was clean and the reception staff were particularly friendly and helpful. The breadkfast was the ususal when abroad, bread cheese and ham really. We loved Spagna and the surrounding area for meals and drinks.. they say you will never walk as much as you will in Rome and that is so true.. Take your trainers and bath salts as if anything like us (and we are only young), you will get alot of exercise with all the walking to the different attractions.

The room was very clean, with nice furnitures, air condition, TV and minibar. The breakfast was very good. The hotel is at a quiet road near Piazza Mancini(north of Vatican city). The metro station is about 10min by foot, so you can go to any place of historical centre of Rome easily. Also has a bus stop next to hotel, where you can catch a bus to Trastevere.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4984126", "Content": "We can truthfully say the hotel is better than most 4 star hotels we have been to never mind 3 star. The Hotel was immaculately clean, staff couldn't be more helpful (we even had little Easter Eggs on our cups and saucers on Easter Sunday morning) and their European breakfast was nice especially for someone with a sweet tooth like me. The staff recommended a great restaurant around the corner where the manager was very welcoming (he sat down at the table with you for a few minutes!), the food was excellent, prices were fair and the atmosphere was great too. It isn't the most central, however The Vatican is a 20 Min walk away, Castel Sant' Angelo is a 15 minute walk, and it is very easy to get to most other places with the Metro.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Delle Vittorie", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d277148-Reviews-Hotel_Delle_Vittorie-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$80 - $197*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Col di Lana 24</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Prati</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00195</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "277148", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/47/3d/ac/getlstd-property-photo.jpg"}}
