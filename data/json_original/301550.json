This is an amazing hotel. Its located right opposite Deira city Centre opposite the Splash store enterance.

The hotel is connected to the Dubai metro directly as the metro station entry is next to the hotel restaurant. the exit of the station connects City Centre! If u love Dubai metro and wana explore the city by metro this is a great place to stay. The in room dining was great. the room facilities included : full serviced italian style kitchen and bar counter Tea coffee making facility dedicated iron and board LCD 42\" screen Washing machine Refrigerator Microwave Oven Electric Stoves Large wash room with shower cubical free use of GYM & pool.

The room was clean and in very good upkeep. Service in the hotel was also excellent and plenty of shops in the area. I really can't find any real faults.

Overall the hotel itself is ok. I feel calling this hotel \"top-value\" is over-rating... but most importantly, they do have serious problems in their service attitude: I'll try to keep the story not too long. We were first in the morning promised to have early check-in at 11:30 am., but when we came back at 1:00 pm. ready to check-in, they said \"room is not available, should be soon\". This \"soon\" eventually took 1,5 hours before I asked for the manager-on-duty. He was arrogant and didn't seem to take the issue too seriously. We finally got the room at 2:55 pm - 3,5 hours later than promised and the official check-in time was anyway at 3:00 pm...

I had to laugh at this event though, very funny if you think about it. Another point, and I find this a common issue at many hotels in Asia and the Middle East, is the 'hotel taxi'.

My family and I had booked two adjoining rooms, one deluxe and the other executive, each were tastefully decorated, spacious, and had modern amenities. The kitchenette facility in each room was well eqquipped and was really helpful to us as we were also travelling with a young child. We ordered room service the first evening we checked in after a very long flight and it was reasonably priced. The hotel was literally on the door step of Deira Metro Station which we utilised to go Jumierah beach, the Burj and the Mall of the Emirates - the train system was reliable and way cheaper (and faster) as Dubai traffic is a nigthmare. Deira City Centre is also a hop, skip and jump from the hotel, a good place for shopping and it also has a supermarket - I suggest going through the Deira Metro Station to reach the Centre as J-Walking is not for the faint hearted. While we were there, we also made use of the business centre (free PC, internet and printing). We were not impressed with the pool as it was quite small and in a very shady position.

The Big Bus tour departs from near Carrefour which was also handy. We were able to print off flight boarding cards easily in the business centre and there was free wifi in the lounge. The apartment was smart, clean and comfortable but some utensils were missing or tired. Staff very helpful - concierges in particular- except reception which was frosty every time we approached them. Starwood membership was recognised at this Le Meridien but there was no special welcome from the reception! It was too hot to venture out far anyway so we did not miss a creek or beach location. We went on the tour bus with a 2 day ticket, used the metro and went in 2 shopping malls. We saw other great hotels but at an enormous room rate. Breakfast was incuded but after check-in, a pre printed letter was put through the door saying we had only paid for 1 breakfast in our rate. I think this is easy to get wrong on the website.

We were looking for a convenient location for a mix of beach, relaxation, shopping and sight seeing. Were upgraded to a one bedroom apartment at no extra cost which was beautifully appointed and very comfortable. The recently opened City Centre metro stop is literally 1 minute walk from the hotel and there is a direct train to Terminal 3 at the airport, also used the metro to get to the Emirates Mall. It costs 5 dirham per trip per person (around 80 pence) and is much cheaper and faster than taxis. The metro station also serves as a subway across to the Mall and is a safeter way to cross the busy street. The hotel reception staff were friendly and tried to be helpful but are unknowlegable about the area. They assured us that the Gold Souk was easily walkable from the hotel but it took over 20 minutes by taxi. There is a leisure desk which was never manned and only were interested in selling tours from a brochure which were at hugely inflated prices. The pool is TINY (the photographer must have used a very wide angled lens on their website) and largely in the shade so not a place to catch some sun. Had some great days out which were all easily reachable from the hotel. The desert safari (booked from a tourist brochure picked up at the airport) is a must - paid 150 dirhams per person - the hotel wanted 220. Al Mamza Park is about 10 minutes by taxi in the opposite direction to Jumeirah Beach. 5 dirhams per person entry to a beautiful park and 3 beaches which were virtually empty, cafes, showers and taxis readily accessible. Spent a day at Wild Wadi water park, was given a 2 for 1 entry by a stranger in the queue (thank you!) which was fun but the new water park at Atlantis is supposed to be much bigger and better although did not go there. Ate at Al Bustan Hotel and had some of the best Lebansese food ever tasted and not at all expensive.

There was a fruit basket on the first day and the newspaper was delivered every morning. The staff was very nice, the hotel was beautiful, and free internet. There was a small pool, and the gym was always empty. Parking was always available underground, and a friend that lives in Dubai was able to drive in and park with no problems. LOCATION: The hotel was located in Deira, across the street from City Centre mall, which is a huge mall. Also close to the Gold Souk and the dinner boat cruises on the river. We were able to walk over to the mall and hop onto the Big Bus tour, also able to walk along the river. The hotel was a good location for us, but still quite far from the Jumeira Beach area. The Big Bus tour was awesome because we were able to make it around Dubai and get off and on the bus no problem. Make sure you start first thing in the morning because there is a lot to see. TRANSPORTATION: Dubais public transportation system is really bad, most tourists do not take the bus, but take cabs instead. Cabs are quite cheap, but traffic can be very bad and because of the layout of the city, it can become quite expensive to drive from point A to point B so make sure to plan out your trips. When we were visiting, they were in the process of building a sky train. SIGHTS: Desert Safari - awesome Big Bus tour - awesome Global Village - horrible, total culture shock, full of crap Mall of the Emirates - awesome Burj Al Arab - amazing Jumeria Beach - beautiful, but not much to it Palm Island, Atlantis Hotel - Awesome Dinner Boat cruise - really nice We went during the shopping festival, and it was great because all the stores have something on sale - better sales then i get at home. The dates for the shopping festival change every year so check online but its ususally mid January to mid February.

When I arrived the hotel on the first day 7 am, the staff told me that the room is not ready until 9 am, so we said we will wait until 9 am (otherwise charge 50% of room rate if check in early). The staff led us to a sofa to rest and gave us 2 bottle mineral water. When we starting to open the cover, the receptionist told us that the room is ready, I quite wonder their responsiveness!!! When I go inside the room, it quite impresses. The room is a 'Studio' type, (bed room, kitchen and bath room). The room is clean, tiny, and the facility is quite complete. The bed is twin bed, it\u2019s tiny and clean. However, the bed is quite old, because when you lie down and get out on the bed, there was a concave on the bed. Beside, I think the size of bed is quite small for Asia People nor western, as you make a turn u might on the floor. For the kitchen, I think is can be consider full equipment, it include 2 hot stove, pans, utensils for cooking & dinner, fridge, kitchen ventilator, toaster, kittle, washing machine, microwave. We make our breakfast everyday, it\u2019s convenience and saving in term of time and money. The utensil includes fork, shovel, a Tefal Pan, and so on but except spoon for dining. The fridge temperature is normal, but the door could not close properly, you have to \u2018kick\u2019 it then only can be close \u2018tightly. When you finish cooking, just leave the plate or utensil on the sink, the room services will be clean on you. The bath room is ok. The temperature of water is hot and strong enough. The room is complete with soup, shampoo, condition and body lotion However; their only prepare 1 bathrobe for 2 guests. The hotel is also not providing slipper, comb and shaver. The Air-con is central control type. I found it\u2019s is a bit \u2018dry\u2019 in mid night. The room cleaning service is normal. Their just clean what ever they \u2018see\u2019 and neglect a very detail matter. Like we go for sand surfing at night, when we come back we wash in the bath room, so there are a plenty of sand on the bath room, at next day we went out and came back at night, we found the sand still there. The location of this hotel is strategy located opposite the Diera Mall. Unfortunate, there constructions between both building, so we have to take a long distance to reach the mall. If not, the location is convenience. Beside, if you have better budget, you should take hotel\u2019s taxi rather then public one. The cost for hotel is 3 \u2013 4 times higher then public taxi. The main point to choose the hotel taxi are there driving attitude is much better and will let you have dizzied. Overall, I satisfied with the hotel.
