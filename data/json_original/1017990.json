{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Awful awful awful Place smells, ceiling has large cracks and holes, caving wallboard, rust spots, moldy stains. Bathroom toilet hadn't been cleaned for years, had black stripes in it, I asked for sheets to be changed, they were dirty. I was afraid to get under the covers the first night. We had items stolen from our room, lizards were crawling in the room because the doors didn't really close properly. Entire facility had large holes in ceilings, dirt everywhere. Our room was carpeted, someone came in with a handmade broom and made some cursory sweeps with it; I don't they they have vacuums, you can imagine what's living in those carpets. Bathroom mirror is clouded and impossible to see (which may be a blessing). Large crack in outside bathroom floor running across the tile on the floor. all bathrooms are outside. Has a nice size pool; tiles are loose, some missing. Chairs by pool have nails sticking out, in complete disrepair, two cushions for 4 chairs with heavy staining. I will never forgive my travel agent for putting me in this dump when there are so many options available.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR665429580", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "drckw"}, {"Content": "It Used to be so Nice, but... My dissapointment started few weeks prior to my arrival, whenthey refused to take my reservation, but told me to just come to the hotel. I even tried to offer pre-payment to secure my room, but they still did not want to confirm it.But anyway, I stayed there just last year (April, 2008) and it was nice so by the time I arrived at Kuta, I just came to the hotel. Apparently they still have 1 room available.When I arrived to my room, I was very surprised to find the room was very dirty.The bed cover and the curtain was full of stain and some part even torn.I went to the bath room and quite satisfied to see the toilet bowl was clean.Then I turned the shower on to wash my feet and left the bathroom.But I was very shocked when I came back 5 minutes later to find worms everywhere. I guess it must have come out from the shower.So I went to the reception (who was having a nap at the reception desk!!) and told him about the incident. But he only stared at me, without even saying sorry and asked some other guy to look at my room.Then I left for few hours and when I got back, I was very mad to find out that, they might have cleaned some of the worms, but they left 1 dead worm on the floor.It was very disgusting. And they did not even took the garbage from the trash bin!So I packed and left. When I checked out, the people at the receprion desk did not even ask why I checked out so early, (not even staying for a night) but just asked me to sign the bill.That was the worst experience I've ever had.It was too bad because the room used to be so nice. It was pretty spaacious, and they do have nice garden and pool, too.But I will never come back there again.", "Date": "Mar 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR681290043", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "unbelievayble"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d1017990-r21437722-Kuta_Bungalow-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1017990", "Price": "$35"}}
