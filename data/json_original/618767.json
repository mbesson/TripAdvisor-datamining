A bottle of water set us back 4 euro 50 on the first night when we arrived as it was late and there was no other choice. The lift was slow to arrive and they even said they would charge an extra 15 euro for checking out a couple of hours later than 11am (as we had a night time flight home). It all just felt very impersonal and like they charged for any little extra they could which is very different from the attitude I have found in other hotels. In addition, the plumbing was noisy and the only English TV channel was BBC World News. Not that we were away to watch TV but still, it just added to the list of things we didn't like.

Everything is lovely and clean and the staff are very friendly. If you are returning after 11pm in the evening you can let yourself in with the same key as your room key no problem at all. Breakfast is lovely and is served on the 7th floor with an inside area and a terrace which was great as we were lucky to have very sunny weather. Good selection of breads, pastries, cheese, fruit, cereals etc and set us up nicely for the day.", "Date": "May 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chevy Chase, MD", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Value\u201d", "Author": "whystayhome", "ReviewID": "UR15494597", "Content": "Three of us stayed in the hotel's Everest triple for 3 nights. It cost only $427 [without breakfast] for the entire stay and we more than got our money's worth. As others have said, the room was spotlessly clean and the comfort level was more than adequate. We were in a wing where there was ventilation on 3 sides, so when it got a little warm, it was easy to cool down the place. I am not sure if there is air conditioning - check that for a summer stay. The location is convenient for many attrations and the bus is quite close. We were initially a little confused about finding the hotel, as the street was not on the map of Berlin in our guidebook, but it is right off Potsdamerstrasse just south of the Potsdamer Bridge. The M48 drops you half a block away or you can take the 200 bus [which connects with the airport bus at the Zoo] to Philharmonie and walk 10 minutes. The only concern I had is that if I were returning late at night by myself, the hotel's street is a quiet, not very well lit residential one and I might be a little nervous as a woman walking alone the few hundred meters off a major thouroughfare to a hotel where you need to fumble with your key to get in after 11PM. Otherwise, I can think of no drawbacks to staying here, given the price that for 3 people was more like hostel rates than a hotel tariff.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ayr", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value hotel\u201d", "Author": "alan1952", "ReviewID": "UR14519338", "Content": "Together with friends, my wife and I stayed at the Lindemann Hotel Fjord for three nights over the Easter weekend.

The hotel was very clean and reasonably priced but be careful if you have a drink in the bar as we thought that the bar prices were quite high (6 euros for a standard Gin and Tonic). A good choice of buffet breakfast in a very nice and airy roof restaurant for 11 euros. All in all a very good and reasonably priced hotel that served as a very good base for touring Berlin.

It was perfect for us, just a short walk to the Potsdamer Platz and tube station. We had originally booked 3 twin rooms but one of our friends was unable to travel so switched to a triple and a twin. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and so was the bathroom. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment but would highly recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive hotel in Berlin.

A very peaceful road very close to Potsdamer Platz , with a bus station right in the next corner!!The rooms are no luxurious but very spacious and very very clean.Breakfast was adequate enough(they even baked bread right in front of you),just what you need gain streangth!! The staff were very kind and helpful.They gave us maps of the city and information and even sell tickets for the means of transport. TIP: you don't have to use the metro since the bus routes of the city and the location of the hotel is so close to every major sight e.g.Potsdamer platz, Reihstag, Bradeburg tor , parizen platz, unter der linden,the spree river and so many more are 10 minutes on foot from the hotel.If you want to explore the city from the east to the west use the doubledeck buses 100 and 200 they practicaly take you everywhere!!And after a long day when you return to the hotel try the hotel's pub that offers you a very cosy enviroment.Berlin is such a wonderful city and when i go back I WILL DEFINATELY STAY AT HOTEL FJORD AGAIN!!!!", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location and great hotel\u201d", "Author": "thisismyreview", "ReviewID": "UR7393140", "Content": "Very cheap (quarduple room for about \u00a360 per night).

The hotel is very clean, resonably priced (triple incl. bkfst: 110 euro) and family run. The real pluses, however, are its location and the breakfast. Fjord stands at the end of a winding cul-de-sac, off the busy Potsdamer Strasse, right against a green playground. It is the first time that I enjoy such silence and secluded accommodation in a big city. It is a 5minutes walk from the main road, Potsdamer Bridge, the Mies Van Der Hohe gallery, the Staats Bilbliothek, Kulturforum and Philarmonia. Walk for 5 minutes more (or take the bus for one stop) and get to the buzzy Potsdamer Platz and the underground station that can take you anywhere.
