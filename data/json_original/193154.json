Although there were two double beds it was too small and I could hardly walk around the bed, especially because there was a low roof. The staff was friendly though and tried to help where possible. It seems it is more like a hostel. There is for example no fridge in the room but drinks can be bought at reception. Your suitcases can be stored on your day of arrival/leaving but you get the key and bring them yourself downstairs and everybody else can then get to them. Normally in a decent hotel not a problem but when you are in a budget hotel with tourists I doubt it is safe. Also the room is mouldy so be careful where you put your suitcase and I think the cleaners have access to the room all day.

The photos of the hotel looked lovely, but the rooms we had were not like the photos. We were in two twin rooms, and they were tiny - it was hard passing one bed to reach the other. My bed was right against the window, which had an unexpected advantage, as it was baking hot in London, so I ended up with my feet hanging out the window catching a slight breeze! Luckily we were just staying one night as there is barely any storage room. There is a small amount of open hanging space, and a tiny open bedside thing between the beds, and a very small counter top with a chair underneath, which had the kettle, cups and coffee stuff on it, but that is all. Nowhere for even our small hand luggage to go, the base of the hanging space being taken up by the safe. The bathroom is in a cupboard that you have to step up into and I reckon it, and possibly all the furniture in the room, was bought from a caravan supplier. It was all very reminiscent of a caravan we stayed in in France, though the shower was unexpectedly pleasant, with a good spray. However, my clothes were in the sink, there was nowhere to put them, as it was pretty obvious that the floor was going to get wet, which it did. There is no space for toiletries apart from on the small cistern. A big tub of Dove handwash is fixed above the sink, and another of bodywash in the shower. The beds and furniture were clean, but the bathroom was scruffy - more from age and repair than actuall dirt though. The windows were filthy, they are those many paned sash windows, and are in need of a paint. The duvet was very thin, and though it was baking, I would be concerned about visiting on a chilly night. Continental breakfast was included in the price, and seemed to be a self service bar with those mini cartons of cerial, bread next to a toaster, a machine dispensing juice, and another of milk, a bowl of chopped or tinned fruit, mini muffins, croissant, hard boiled eggs and a hot drinks machine. None of it was any use to me except the juice, black coffee (yuk) and possibly eating jam on toast without butter (yuk) as I am lactose intollerant. The receptionist in the very modern and air conditioned reception was a darling. He pointed me out the newsagent accross the road for supplies, and told me not to order a taxi as there is a minimum charge, and loads drive past all the time (this is true, traffic is constantly passing except int he wee hours, and loads of empty taxis returning to Victoria head past the hotel). The hotel is a quick walk to the Appollo Theatre, which was great as we went to see Wicked, and Victoria station is only a tiny bit further along.

We were going to Wimbledon to watch the tennis, so wanted somewhere approximately halfway between central London/St Pancras train station and the tennis....which this was. We arrived late on Thursday night, but were greeted warmly and the receptionist/night porter was friendly and gave us some help and tips regarding our stay. We'd specifically picked the hotel for its location and the fact it had a lift and the lift was well sized and working, which was handy as were on the 3rd floor. The only slight negatives we had with the hotel was the size of the en-suite bathroom and the hotness of the room. The bathroom was on the small side, but worked fine for us, but if you like a big shower, this might not be the best shower cubicle for you! I should say we were in room 304, and it was a nice sizeed bedroom which seems to have been relatvively recently painted. Obviously to an extent the heat in the room isn't the fault of the hotel, but maybe leaving the windows open would be a good idea (for the future, if the management are reading this). We opened the windows and then went to a pub round the corner for an hour or so...incidentally there are plenty of bars, shops and restaurants in this area, which was handy and a nice bonus. The room was slightly cooler when we returned, but still very warm and muggy. It cooled a bit during the night, but then the traffic and general everyday noise started about 6am. Not a massive problem, but just something for light sleepers to be aware of. It was a little frustrating to come back on the second night and find the windows closed again and the room very warm. There is a continental breakfast included in the price, but we never tried it. I should also add I have to use a wheelchair to travel longer distances. There are only a few shallow steps upto the front door, which my partner helped me with and then inside the hotel it was all flat, or obviously there was the lift. Overall, we had a good stay and I'd definitely stay there again if I needed to stay in that part of London.

The room was tiny and definitely needed to be renovated. The walls and ceilings were cracked. The paint was peeling off the walls. The bathroom was full of mold and mildew. The tiles were cracked and loose. The shower curtain had blood stains and mildew on the bottom of it. The trash hadn't been emptied and there was a used female hygiene pad behind the toilet wrapped in tissue that somehow got overlooked. The cherry on top was the pubic hair that was located in the bed when I pulled the sheets down to go to bed. I complained but nothing was done.

From Victoria TRain Station was a good 10-15 minutes walk with luggages and on the way I saw many other hotels, passsed some grtocery store , restaruant and KFc. The outside of the hotel is nice in order to attract custmers to a prison. Anyway got in it was warm and the reception guy was okay. Booked family room expecting a room like on their website but no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \"Here you go room 52 in the basement\" said the staff After opening many fire door and many turns (like a maze) i found it asnd expecting a nice room but no. okay the key rarely fits as its old fashioned and some room keys werte attcually cards and the room using cards to open were attcually cheaper or the same price as this room! Okay got in super small with little amennty like a prison. Family room is one samll sofa bed smaller than doubke bed and one real double bed. The floor wasnt carpet it was atucally fake wood that squeeks when ever you go on it. The TV wsas on the roof and small and not walking. There were water pipes and a stinky smell as sewage go on top of the room. okay bathroom small and poorly mainted and shampoo was running low. THere was a small desk with a chair and the desrk was filled weith junks like instant cofee with dirty mugs and feedback forms. THe gunranteed wifi signal in my room was not avalible. Okay later on i go and complain and this indian staff with a bad atictiude hears our consverstion \"May I help you\" \"Yes I want to know complasin about the room 52 and thw wifi signal\" \"I understand room 52 is poor and all the other basement rooms so I change your room\" regarding wifi signal who said it was avialbe in your room\" \"Your website and your collegue\" \"Okay you may be right but i need to see your proof\" anyway after arguing they agreed to switch room the next day to a diffrent family room. The breakfast = horrible. not wholly cooked egg , toast,yougurt,milk,creal,juice,butter, packaked muffin,cofee. Okay so I can bear with it When i got my room changed i found out it was much better and was atucally the same rate as room 52. I had room 17 on the ground floor with wifi signal. SO I unlock the door with a CARD then the floor was carpet and this time real beds not it looks a bit like the websites picture. The toilet shower however was a flaw it was about 2cm lower than the toiolet floor with just a curtain blocking so it floods easliy. Nextg day I deciede to complain for a compesation about my first night and there I was with the bad attitude indian manager. When I told her everything she said \"What do you expect this isnt 5 star its only a budget hotel\" after listing out the things she relieved her dtress on me she said \"I have other things to worry about too like my daughters school .. any other things please tell me in writing\" The story is way to long on all the bad things remeber JUST DONT BOOK THIS HOTEL THE BASEMENT ROOMNS ARE LIKE A PRISON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So it's never going to be the Ritz, is it? But I'm fairly sure even the waste disposal area at the Ritz is going to be a step up compared to this. I thought I'd list the hotel's 'features' and you can decide for yourself whether to book yourself in or perhaps look elsewhere. Reception area - Has obviously been wittily refitted in a retro 1970's style (surely?) Bus station meets youth hostel. Service was swift but I suspect mainly to keep people moving and not give anyone the chance to complain anymore than they were already. Corridor areas - In a sheer stroke of luck Room 52 is in the basement allowing a fully exploration of the hotel's corridor system. It turns out those carpets weren't actually patterned. It was stains. And handles on doors are so last year. I can fully see their point. And what's this? An outside corridor? How exciting. It's raining but in a corridor? Look on the bright side though you'd be perfectly safe in a fire. Something this damp is never going to burn. The Room - Obviously the card swipe system wasn't working. And obviously all hotels need a healthy gap between the door and the floor allowing clear conversations between you and any other lucky guests who are walking by. What's this? A laminate floor? A patterned laminate flo .... Oh no ... My mistake more stains. Thrill at the creaks as the floor shifts as you move across it. Be amazed at how anyone could fit a floor this badly. Watch out for the rotten bit by the radiator. Again - on the more positive side - no one is going to creep up on you in the middle of the night. The bed is comfy and clean - which is just as well as it's just about the only part of the hotel that is. The furniture has seen better days and there's an odd bit just above the bed with a badly nailed on (it fell off) hardboard cover. A little later on that evening it became clear what that was ... Anyway onto the bathroom which possibly is the only one I've been in where you have a serious risk of being dirtier coming out than when you went in. Rot on the door frame, mould on the walls. But the shower .... It was amazing. Rather than risk giving the staff something extra to clean the hotel has decided just to use a shower tray. Someone perhaps needs to point out that it's quite hard to keep water in the shower tray using fresh air alone. Mind you, to be fair, there was a lot of hot water. Sadly mainly on the floor. So back to the bedroom and the mysterious box above the bed. Turns out it's the soil pipe from the room above. Some people prefer the sounds of whales singing, some people count sheep and others think of little fluffy rabbits as they drift off to sleep. And me?

I can assure you there was nothing super about it and it wasn't the setting for the romantic break I'd envisaged. It was \u00c2\u00a394 for one double room with continental breakfast. Despite requesting a room on an upper floor when we booked, we were assigned to room 52 which was in the basement - accessed by a dirty corridor and several sets of stairs. There was a window on one side - through which you could see and hear people walking past on the street. The blind was wonky and didn't fit all the way across the window. The floor was laminated wood effect, with dirty marks all over and creaked where ever you trod. The room was at the beginning of the corridor to the other rooms in the basement area so there was a lot of noise and shutting of doors from people going to their rooms beyond ours. The room was cold - the radiator didn't work but there was a plug in electric heater. The bathroom was tiny and frankly the worst I have ever seen (and I've stayed in some skanky places) - there was mould, flaking paint, rust, a cracked basin, dirty taps. There was no bath, but a shower tray that was so shallow you could only have a quick shower or else the tray would have overflowed as the water didn't drain away very quickly. On the plus side I have to say the shower was powerful and there was plenty of hot water. There was a tiny tv on a wall bracket - binoculars would have been helpful - and a small 'wardrobe' without sides - so basically just a front and a back and a rail with one coat hanger. We did complain twice (immediately once we saw the room and again before we went out for dinner) but were told there were no other rooms available. The man on reception said he'd speak to the manager later (apparently he wasn't there at that time) and get back to us but never did (and we stayed out as late as we could). We took some photos of the most offending bits of the room on our mobile phone and showed them to him - he said he was sorry but reiterated there was no other room to give us and they were very busy , there had been a mix-up with some rooms earlier and it was his first day back off holiday and he couldn't do anything about it. The worst part of the whole experience was the 'box on the wall above the bed' that we discovered later, after getting into bed (and the bed itself was actually very comfortable), turned out to house the waste pipe from a room above. I won't go into detail but suffice to say we went to bed and were greeted in the morning by sounds that no-one should have to endure. They may as well have been going to the toilet at the end of our bed. I am not overly fussed by many things but I had to put the pillow over my head to stop myself gagging.

The blinds on the windows were scummy to say the least, my partner had to climb on the bed and roll them down from the roof because the cords were broken. The TV was a portable thing on a bracket in the corner and the wardrobe was 4 pieces of wood screwed together, a rail running across and no doors. There was no number to telephone reception, probably to avoid the compaint calls. The only saving grace was the bed which was comfortable. The bathroom was the worst I've ever seen and I've seen some real[-]. The floor wasn't tiled and if you took 1 step forward from the toilet you would be in the shower basin. I have seen better bathrooms on camp sites. Would I stay here again? Maybe if I was homeless, pennyless, saturated from 40 days and 40 nights of relentless rain and it was free. Until then not until hell becomes incredibly cold.

When we first arrived it was before check-in and we just wanted to leave our luggage. The receptionist simply gave me the key to the luggage room and sent me to the basement without even checking who I was. The location of the hotel is good (between Victoria and Pimlico stations) and the price was reasonable for London - we paid \u00c2\u00a372 a night for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However...... - Size of the room: the room my boyfriend and I were given could not be called a double. There was hardly any room around the bed and we had to take it in turns to unpack and get changed. See the attached photo and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see how little room there was around the bed, and I took the photo with my back to the wall. I did mention to a member of staff that really we were paying double room rates for what could only be describe as a single, and she just smiled at me and walked away. My parents and my brother and sister in law had better sized rooms, however all of them had the smallest bathrooms I've ever seen. As my Dad said, the bathrooms are bigger on North Sea Ferries..... - Cleanliness: the room wasn't all that clean; the shower curtain and bathroom door were dirty, and there were big cobwebs on the ceiling. I don't think the carpet was very well hoovered either, but in all fairness to the cleaners they probably couldn't fit the hoover in the room anyway. - Electrics: looked a bit dodgy - Service: I asked the hotel to chill a bottle of champagne for me to celebrate my parents' anniversary and they were unable to help. We also asked to borrow an iron only to be told the only one they had had been borrowed and they couldn't remember by who so were unable to get it back for us. Having said that, we would probably have had to do the ironing in the corridor as a board wouldn't have fit in our room (seriously). Breakfast: this was ok and there was plenty of it, just not the freshest food or the best quality (tinned fruit, croissants were a bit chewy). The kitchen area was tiny and people were falling over each other to get to the fridge or get cups of coffee. Other: there we no hooks anywhere in our room, so nowhere to hang our coats, and no hooks or towel rails to hang up our wet towels. Also, the safe in the room was \u00c2\u00a32 a day - I've never had to pay for a hotel safe before. So all in all we were unimpressed. I know you can't expect a 5* hotel for that money in London, but I still feel the service and cleanliness could have been better, plus a few additions to the rooms (a towel rail, for example) could make a real difference.

The hotel is also near a range a nice restaurants and shops (the mexican was rather good and welcoming). So no faults with the location at all. The hotel is basic and budget and definately no frills but hey thats what we paid for and lets be honest we were out of the hotel at 9.30am each day returning at 11pm. Check in was fine and we were on the top floor. We had an attic room that consisted of two single beds and a double bed (You can see it on the website). The beds were realy comfy or we were realy tired - we decided to have a bed each! The room was not huge but was big enough for us. The bathroom was quite small - I have been in bigger ones in caravans! The bathroom was like a sealed unit with shower, sink and toilet all at the same level (a little like a wet room). I was surprised the tiny room did not flood during showers but it didnt. The only strange thing we found was that it felt like the bathroom was swaying when you were in it and that was without any drink! Now for the moan: When we got to the room there was a very strong smell of paint and the bathroom door was a bit tacky, so just had been done. Also the room window was open and would not close. This was not a problem as it was small and we needed the air due tot he paint fumes! The room lock had a lot to be desired Im sure a hard kick would have sufficiently opened the door. Breakfast was ok a bit of a tight squeeze as everyone was lined up around the single toaster but there was plenty of other stuff to eat such as serials coissants etc. Dont be late though everything gets put away on the dot! We went down about 9.15 and there was no bread for the toaster but as they were about to close up (9.30) they would not put any more out. Radiators in the corridors seemed to be on full pelt (It was like Dantes furnace) but hey if they hadnt been on I would probibly be complaining it was too cold! In some things hotels cant win :) All in all it was a budget hotel, a budget price, comfy beds and a fantastic location.
