Yes, it is 'an airport hotel', and sort of does what it says on the tin but firstly the transfer form the airport took an absolute age as they didn't seem to know who they were picking up from which terminal or when, Secondly felt like the check-in was a real chore for the people behind the desk. Third did not really enjoy walking around in the dark to find the room, and when we did I thought we'd been transported to a Pontins camp. Fourth, we had to leave early the next morning and the only thing on offer was a coffee making machine and a doughnut for breakfast, OK if you're Homer Simpson I guess. And the guy on the desk was really grumpy again. Positives - clean and quite close to the airport.

Free shuttle service is provided - transfer takes about 20 minutes. This hotel has a feel of highway motel, with majority of room having no indoor hallways. Location and the layout of the hotel contributed to a lot of outside noise at all times of the night. Room is simple - no AC in mine - but clean. Bathroom and shower are clean and on a large side. Breakfast was basic and costs extra - not a good value. This is a budget hotel - and good for one night stay - yet, there are many similar hotels near the airport and I will try a new one on my next pass through Madrid.

The facts- there is really a free bus that picks you up (and returns) to the airport, thats efficefficient.; the hotel is about 10 minutes from the airport and there\u00b4s a parking lot if you are flying and dryving. The hotel is located next to a free-way, so expect allot of noise during the night!. It is composed by too building. We stayed in the main one, the the reception and bar is. The room and general hotel style are simple, and practical. Despite the furniture were dated and used, the rooms were clean and spacious.

I have never experienced anywhere so noisy in my life! all the rooms have wooden floors so you can hear everyone clacking about but it must be due to the construction of the building that it sounds like the people in the adjoining rooms are in your room with you, so much so that you can even hear what people next/above/below you are saying (and doing!!) in their rooms! worst night ive ever had in a hotel...youll only get to sleep here if you're a VERY heavy sleeper!", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBooked at airport hotel reservations...\u201d", "Author": "jerrikamison", "ReviewID": "UR64751330", "Content": "Booked at airport hotel reservations desk.

The taxi driver could not find it and although we could see it from the highway, it was set in a very convoluted traffic maze surrounded by what appeared to be car lots. The place is sandwiched between industrial type buildings overlooking a busy highway, very seedy. Upon arrival we were told that our room was on the first floor...first floor being up about 20 stairs...no elevator or ramp for luggage. The room was spacious and clean. Two single beds, but we didn't mind since it was only for one night.....we were hungry and tired and looked at the room service menu....the first thing that popped out was 30 euro for a ham plate....Chicken brochette was 21 euro...so, we decided to check the restaurant...the restaurant menu showed chicken brochette for 18 euro........so, we decided to eat in the restaurant to save 3 euro....upon sitting the waiter brought a dish of olives and basket of bread to the table...I told him I don't eat olives or bread and he said that there is a 3 euro \"table\" charge and they would be included in that price....so, I ended up paying 21 euro for the entree that I could have better enjoyed in the room.... coffee was additional 4 euro... Free WIFI only.... wired internet was 5.25 euro for an hour....not impressed...I only wanted to check flight, but did not want to pay 5.25 euro for a 2 min session The end result, I would not recommend this hotel since although the room was very cheap and clean...the $ you save on the room will be spent on food and drink.

Internet connection is very slow but if you push them for it they will give it you for free. there are better, cheaper hotels locally we just did not know it at the time! express breakfast was served in hotel reception was \u20ac3 for a coffee and sticky bun. it does have a free shuttle bus to the airport", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cAVOID!!!\u201d", "Author": "piupolino", "ReviewID": "UR46934594", "Content": "Horrible.

Though they adverstise having wireless access, only the main building gets it, and when we asked to be moved to one of those rooms the concierge told us that even though there was in fact a room available in that building, it was being held for any return guests who had learned on their previous stay that the other buildings don't pick up the wireless signal. As if anyone would ever return to this place! The hotel interiors are sad and depressing, located in long brick buildings that resemble prisons or military baracks. We had to be moved from our first room because the bathroom window's lock was broken and the place is crawling with unsavory men. There is no information in the rooms about how to do simple things like get an outside line or locate the resteraunt. The resteraunt, however, should be avoided at all costs. The food seemed to have time traveled from 1970. The asparagus that seemd vaguely promising were plucked from jars and heaped with mayonnaise. It cost 11 Euros to eat a not particulalry tasty tomato heaped with not particulalry fresh parmesan cheese. The tiny plate of bread and cheese that the waiter brought, unasked, was not complimentary and was also overpriced. The meal was super expensive and we wound up using the bulk of it to feed the stray cats that prowl the hotel grounds. Thank god for the stray cats! They are the only nice thing about this place.
