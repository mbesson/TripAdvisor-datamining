Plus they offer me a breakfast on the arrival date! Usually breakfast is for the next morning. I stayed at the Arena hotel for 8 nights and enjoy every bit of traditional Turkish hospitality from all of the hotel member. The hotel is small but cozy and tidy. All amenities are provided, from bath robe, slippers, towel set, coffee/tea pot and replenished coffee and tea stock everyday, minibar, and safe box. Free wifi is also available from my room. Full buffet breakfast with egg, coffee, cappucino, hot chocolate, milk, tea, juices, yoghurt, cheeses, all sort of meat, bread and pastry, nuts, etc. What more you would expect? They even have the Turkish bath. All staff are friendly and very helpful. Special thanks to Faruk who accompanied me to shop at Spice Bazaar and Grand Bazaar, help me in bargaining so that I spent less money, explained how to brew Turkish's coffee using Ibrik, and boiled Turkish's tea, lend me a proper camera, allow me to use his Istanbulkart to get on the public transportation cheaper (sometimes 50% less than normal fares) on tram, furnikuler, metro subway and ferry. Location wise, it's perfect. Less than 30 minutes by taxi from the Ataturk International airport. My suggestion is that you ask an airport pick up from the hotel. For only 20 euros you are free from worrying to find the hotel location. The hotel is located in Sultanahmet area where most of the tourist interests are: the marvelous Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, Hippodrome, Tohkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar, Spice Bazaar. And if you want to go to Taksim, tram station is in this location as well. I walked in the beautiful area everyday and never get enough. Sultanahmet area is good for walk, but you need to wear a comfortable shoes, high heels are a no no. There are 3 kofte restaurants near the Sultanahmet (Blue Mosque) tram station. Choose the one in the middle for the most delicious kofte. Kofte is a grilled minced beef, one among many Turkish's great culinaries. For coffee lovers, try Turk's coffee at Kahve Dunyasi which are available throughout Istanbul, and there is one in the Sultanahmet area. The coffee is served with chocolate covered cofee bean which is crunchy. The cafe itself, Kahve Dunyasi, is a unique blend of coffee and chocolatiers. I am glad I can came across this hotel.

This right sized boutique hotel, located in Sultanahment, minutes from all major attractions, was the proverbial oasis in a desert of unknown residences and hotels. It's quaint in a good way, spotless and professional. The staff (Onur, Hasan, Farouk and Selcok) catered to our every whim and advised us when ever asked. The morning breakfast is presented well, always with fresh food and enabled us to start the day knowing we had a good nutritional base. This hotel, located on a quiet street, was perfect for the two of us. It was cozy in an old world sense, with sitting and reading rooms, and an outdoor terrace (where meals are served in the \"Delight\" restaurant). We walk alot on vacation and it was such a joy to \"come home\" to our hotel and relax. Our first stay in Istanbul was much enhanced by our accommodation and the people who work there.

The hotel has a lot of character and its own set of quirks and charms. This isn't a big, inpersonal chain hotel. This is a 19th Century house that has been converted into a hotel and gives you a feeling of place and time. You're not going to forget that you're in Turkey, in Sultanahmet while you're staying there. It's an experience, one with charm and unique features that are going to create memories. If you're looking for a large room with five-star comfort, you're likely better in Taksim at the Grand Hayatt or the Conrad. But if you want a stay that is going to leave you with memories of Istanbul, you're going to love the Arena. Having read some of the recent reviews, I was worried that the staff or management had changed. I found them to be the same helpful, courteous, and service-oriented people I first met five years ago. They were always willing to assist and make suggestions. I really think they go out of their way to try and make each guests' stay as enjoyable as possible. Both my friend and I had rooms up on the 4th floor, under the roof. Given the slanted nature of the roof, these were quirky, funky spaces. You had to duck to get to some parts of the room. Again, I don't see this as a disadvantage but part of the character of the place, reminding me that this was an old ottoman house and the view out across the Sea of Mamara from my rooftop window was absolutely spectacular. I understand these quirky spaces aren't for everyone and would recommend that if you're looking for something larger, book one of the Sultan's Corner rooms. Personally, I was extremely happy and would come back again in a heart beat.

It was no problem for them and sure enough our transfer waited for us outside the terminal on arrival. This was to be the lasting impression of our stay at the Arena over the next 8 days! The team of Vedat, Faruk, Hassan, Mehmet and Doghan were always obliging and ever-helpful to make our stay a most pleasing experience. Their listing at #188 of Istanbul hotels is most undeserving as they should be rated in the TOP TEN! Although the hotel had their own recommended places to eat and visit, they would even take note of any recommendations that we made to them from our own experiences. We had 2 fantastic nights dining in the Kumkapi restaurant area, part of the Emin\u00c3\u00b6n\u00c3\u00bc district and famous for their fish restaurants and very lively entertainment. They even arranged free shuttle transfers for us from the hotel to the restaurants. Our large room (the Sultan Corner) was worth choosing and spotlessly clean. Although we were situated right next to the mosque, the early morning call to prayer just added to the 'flavour' of the place - Incidentally, the Sokullu Mehmet mosque is a must-visit as I found the tilework even more beautiful than the bigger and more famous Blue mosque! When visiting Istanbul, the normal visitor wants to see all the famous landmarks and fit in as much as possible without the hassles of travelling between places. The Arena hotel is so well situated for this purpose, that you can take a stroll after a hearty breakfast just up the small hill and take everything in without getting lost. Speaking of breakfast, the Arena lays on a sumptuous spread every morning, and I can recommend the chef's special omlette, which could easily have fed 2 of us. I believe there is a turkish spa in the basement, unfortunately we never tried it as it was the middle of summer and we did not feel the need for this treatment. If the hotel had a swimming pool this would have given the Arena a 6-Star status! The free wi-fi was very welcome and the reception was excellent in all parts of the hotel. As I mentioned already, the hotel staff were extremely friendly and made my daughter feel really special during her stay. I wanted to smoke a cigar watching the sun set over the Marmara bay, but the hotel does not have a rooftop. However, they arranged for us to go to the hotel next door and sit on their rooftop and brought us long cooldrinks to enjoy as well. I made sure the cigar lasted long enough for us to savour every moment of this magical destination! The area is extremely safe and we would walk the narrow streets well after midnight to get back to our rooms without feeling insecure.

Onor became an instant hero by sorting out our online check-in with Turkish Airlines which required a phonecal! The hotel is located within a few minutes pleasant walk of all the major sights and only a very efficient tram ride away from the rest . We booked our stay directly with the hotel and were offered a package which included; a personal guide for a day, a boat trip on the Bosphorus which stopped off in Asia for Anatolian yoghurt!, a folk dancing concert. a dinner in the hotel and airport pick up and drop off (modern Mercedes people carrier). Every part of the package was thoroughly enjoyable and highly reccommended. The hotel is next door to one Mosque and a few yards away from another. The call to prayers early in the morning and in the evening, echoing throughout the city, only added to the magic of the stay. To make this appraisal honest I have to include one slight criticism; though the food is good, the restaurant prices are a little high, being priced in Euros and not Turkish Lira, but you don't have to eat there!

The personal service of the concierges was the fact that pleased me the most. The night we were to have our free dinner the cook was ill. The concierge walked us over to a reasonably priced restaurant that he often went to. I was totally impressed. When Omar did recover the next day, his breakfast omelets were great! They booked everything we asked for and gave us reliable information. We even wound up with small discounts on some of the tours we booked! I was touched on the last day of our visit. My husband had wanted to visit an aquarium but, of course, we had little idea of just how to get there. It so happened that one of the concierges in the front lobby had the day off and was headed in that direction. He took us in tow (all six of us) and guided us out to the aquarium.

Hotel is actually something of a misnomer as a name for this wonderful place since the feel of it is more that of the private home that it once was. One feels that one is being welcomed by the most hospitable family to enjoy their house. The staff here make the experience what it is--their helpfulness, their friendliness, their knowledgeability. They are all well versed in the ways of Istanbul and its transportation, they answer every question about how to get to some place with detailed information and often with helpful computer print outs of maps. The highest level of service is available from this personnel 24/7 as my wife and I found when we were leaving for the airport at 5 AM and were taken care of with a full breakfast as though we had been coming down to the lobby at more regular hours. Which brings me to the subject of the breakfast and of the restaurant in general. The breakfast buffet is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen and partaken of--it is lavish in the choices which it offers. It is the work of Murat Ozdemir and his wonderful assistants, but it is only the beginning of what they offer. The restaurant is available 24/7--this is no idle claim--we tested it at various odd hours when we wanted food and got the same kind of elegant meals no matter what the time of day or night was. Fantastic cuisine, great cooking, but the availability of it at any time of day or night increased the feeling that we had somehow been invited into someone's house and given access to the family cook. Great food imaginatively prepared and superb Turkish wines the existence of which I had not even suspected. We were during our stay here upgraded to a beautiful corner room with a view of the Sea of Marmara. We used to come home early from our rounds of touring just to be in place for the sunsets which we could view from our room--nothing in Istanbul surpassed them.

As detailed by my partner (English being her 3rd language) we did experience being robbed while staying at this so called hotel. My chronological account of the events is as follows: The safe provided in each room are a Turkish made safe constructed by : Truva ,-- , -- The safe I self requires the user to use a 4 digit pin number , I used the same 4 digit number I use for all 3 of my credit cards , I phone and the same number I use for my telephone banking. On returning back to the hotel one evening I realised the safe no longer accepted my 4 digit number, attempting 3 times I engaged the time delay which ment I had to wait 15 mins to try again, again I tried with no success, my immediate suspicion was that someone had accessed our room safe. I called one of the staff who came in all smiling and said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry this happens all the time, the safe forgot your number \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 he used his master code to unlock our safe after which I did confront him and asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 how could a computer chip forget my 4 digit number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he could not give no answer. I was not impressed the least hence why I immediately took the details of the safe and used Google to get the manufactures details as I refused to believe that a computer could so easily forget our pin number. It was not until the following morning that we realised that 500 Euros were missing ( be it from the dressing table ) upset and angry my partner confronted the receptionist , his response was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I am not bothered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 and then obscene language was used by him while other guests were watching , (Photos of this staff member were taken by me at this point) He finally after 20 mins agreed to call his manger (as he refused to call the police) the manger spoke to my partner and to myself and assured me that each safe would remember how many times the master code was used to access it, This was Sunday morning and as a result no technician could be called out until the next working day (Monday). Monday the tall manger ( who is the only one who can really speak English or who possess any kind of people skills ) assured us the technician would come and when he did he would call us , no technician turned up and our check out was the following day. Tuesday the manger did not turn up and neither did the mystery safe technician. Upon my check out I asked for the bill and the reply was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153your bill has already been paid \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was shocked as I knew my credit cards had not been taken out of my wallet in more than 5 days (I have since learnt they used my Lloyds tsb visa card without my permission, and a fraud report had been filled with my bank I am still to this day at a total loss of who they could have got my card details) I was even made to pay the 30 Euros transfer fee to the airport. We did approach the police the very next day after the robbery, the police station was just 500meters at the bottom of the road only being able to communication with them by speaking Arabic we learnt that any report could only be made with the help of a Turkish translator, we spoke to two officers one being a very tall gentleman called Ahmed. We showed them our passports and were advised that they may come and visit the hotel (as far as I am aware nothing came of it) 500 Euros was not worth wasting a full day or more chasing a police report, acquiring a translator etc. Mr DEREA\u00c4\u017eZI accuses us of make a false claim from our insurance company BUT at the same time also says we refused to make a police report, The manager also added the abusive staff memeber no longer works within the company, ( Mr DEREA\u00c4\u017eZI AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW ANY SORT OF INSURANCE CLAIM MADE WOULD HAVE TO BE SUPPORTED BY A POLICE CRIME REFFERENCE NUMBER , YOU CAN NOT ACCUSE US OF MAKING A FALSE INSURANCE CLAIM AND THEN AT THE SAME TIME SAY WE REFUSED POLICE HELP IT MAKES ZERO SENSE. Any way I dont want to spend too long dwelling on how some little petty thief stole some money , but one thing which I did notice this hotel does to many customers is that one first arriving you are given the BASEMENT room which has two single beds and very very loud pipes , IF THIS ROOM IS GIVEN TOO U SAY NO WAY! OR BETTER STILL LOOK ELSE WERE! I have tried to be as factual as I can in this review and have kept any venom I had for this place locked away as life is too short to dwell on thief.

My advice would be to ignore the good reviews on this site, but let me start with the positives. There is just one really: location is brilliant (5 mins from Blue Mosqua and Ayia Sofia) though the penalty for staying in this part of Istanbul is being woken by the call for prayer, although I personally think this adds to the atmosphere. The street the hotel is on is, however, rather down at heel. As for the rest: do not even consider a standard room, they are like cells: just wide enough for two 3ft single beds shoved aagainst each wall and one bedside table between. Our room was under the eaves and very hot. The air conditioning was broken for half our stay (to be fair staff did provide fans on request). When it worked, it was not sufficient to cool the room in May so would be woefully inadequate in summer. The sulatn corner rooms are quite spacious and the only ones you should consider at all. The shower was good,except when the hot water ran out, but the ceiling was peeling. The rooms are not 100% clean, the bed linen is horrid and has nylon frills on it and the pillows are polyester bricks. Also there is an odd habit of leaving dusty plastic flowers on the bed. The minibar was fridge in the corner of the room which had to be switched off as it made the room even hotter. There was no curtain on the window so if the Muezzin didn't wake you the sun did. Breakfast is quite extensive and there is some nice food, but the hot food was never above tepid. Whilst I wouldn't personally choose the dead granny style of decoration the hotel has adopted, from the website it looked very nicely maintained and that's why we chose it. In reality it's just a rather depressing gloomy place that needs a serious makeover. I'd be amazed if you couldn't find better for your money.

Breakfast itself was pretty good - fairly typical for Istanbul with plenty of cheeses to choose from. One problem you will likely encounter if you stay at this hotel is that taxis cannot find it.

He is so very helpful, He is what made our stay there perfect. ok lets go to rooms I mean their charming,well designed in other word tastefully,large and the most important thing for all of us it\u00c2\u00b4scleanliness can not be discussed and other thing during our stay I never heard any noise neither inside the hotel nor outside the hotel so probably they have sound proof rooms or well blocked, honestly I was gonna ask it but obviously I forget it . the restaurant it is perfect actually I have no words in my dictionary to describe it is excellence,every kind of dishes can be found especially turkish meal is delicious. seriously there are so many things I wanna talk about this hotel but as you see this message gonna be endless if I keep writting like this so before I finish my review I am sure you wonder know what about their position it is situated centre of the istanbul just a few steps out from the hotel you will have found yourself centre of wonderfull city with ancient and modern life will be waiting for you just around where you stay .

The location is convenient and it is on a quieter street in the Sultanahmet and, upon check-in, the staff was very welcoming and we were able to converse in English easily. However, that's where the good points ended for us. The room was tiny and was not as well appointed as a 4* hotel room should have been. Unfortunately, the air conditioning was broken when we checked in and there were no screens on the windows. The only thing the hotel staff said they could do at the time was to give us a fan, there was no discussion of changing rooms or switching us to another hotel. We found out that the hotel had been lying to other guests who's air condition wasn't working either that week, continuing to tell them that it would be fixed soon. Luckily our travel agency was able to accommodate us at another hotel. However, the staff at the Arena hotel blatantly lied to our travel agency in discussions regarding our situation and told them that the air conditioning was working just fine and that they had delivered a special honeymoon present to us from the travel agency (which they hadn't given us). The travel agency also sent a time-sensitive fax to the hotel for us, which the hotel handed to us too late. I wish the Arena hotel had lived up to it's description and (assuming) previous experiences of the travel agency. We were expecting a wonderful stay and instead got a frustrating, disappointing experience.

It was lovely and bright, with lots of windows, a flat-screen TV hooked up to sattelite channels and even a small balcony looking out over the sea... A perfect escape when Istanbul all gets a bit too much! We had a very pleasing stay. Unlike many other reviewers, my earplugs remain unused as I didn't find the call to prayer disturbing at all. On only one occasion did I fail to sleep soundly and in that instance, I'd actually been woken by a dream rather than any noise! The hotel was perfect for our needs, our room was made more relaxing with the addition of complimentary slippers and bathrobes and the location is wonderful, just a stone's throw from the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine cistern, Grand Bazaar and a multitude of other fabulous historic sites. The Arena\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breakfast buffet is fairly standard and did not differ in content from day to day. It was lacking fresh fruit, but there was plenty of bread, yogurt, cereals, preserves, and er, small biscuits, to choose from! Slightly baffling, but I ate them anyway, justifying this with the sound reasoning that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly traditional and a Turkish breakfast staple. (My tongue is firmly in cheek) If you are planning to stay here I offer the following advice: If you *can* book a transfer from the airport, do so! The Sultanahmet streets are badly signposted and ALL of the cab drivers we encountered were unable to find the Arena Hotel, even with a map. The transfer companies on the other hand, know exactly where they're going. From Sabiha, it's worth shopping around. Backpackerstravel.net were offering 20 Euros PP each way when I booked - cheaper than anywhere else. Would I recommend it? Oh, yes, definitely.

We noticed three improvements over 2006. Breakfast is much better, taxi drivers now know where the Arena is, and the area looks less run-down as more buildings are renovated. I feel safe to walk at night. The only real noise I noticed was the daily dawn call to prayers. Having traveled enough in Muslim areas I have no problem sleeping through the call to prayers, but I admit the first time can be a shock. Calls are taped and played over loud speakers; several can be heard each beginning at a slightly different time and in a different key. Result: cacophony.

(My friend had a room on the other side of the hotel and also was awakened, so you can't escape this--the whole neighborhood is invited to pray 5 times a day from the loud speakers on the minarets of the mosque; management acknowledges this, but can't do anything about it). Breakfast (included in price) is very good and eating on the outdoor patio on a summer morning was a treat. Staff able to recommend restaurants and was good on delivering messages.

For one, we were on the bottom floor at street level, so we not only had to endure noise of pedestrians and yelling children, but also the 5 AM call to prayer. The hotel wasn't full as far as we could tell, so our room assignment was a mystery. The air conditioning system was VERY hard to control and it was miserably hot most of the time even with the thermostat set to 5 degrees. We finally figured out that for the air conditioning to blow ANY cold air, you couldn't have the bathroom light/fan on. That makes a LOT of sense. Thanks for the heads up, staff. On top of this, whenever we left the room, they would turn our air off! The hotel has a hamam (15 euro) but if you go out for a few hours, the hamam comes to you for free! One consequence of this heat and humidity is that it made the room STINK. The bathroom was equally horrible. As already mentioned, the toilet seat is very thin and uncomfortable. The toilet flushing mechanism was a complete mystery. It usually took about 15 flushes before any paper would go down. And the bathroom door would not stay open on its own. The breakfast was very mediocre. We weren't always in the best mood when we had breakfast because we'd been up all night with the heat and noise, so we wanted to strangle whoever had it on Istanbul's TECHNO station at 8 AM. Furthermore, don't choose this hotel because it has wireless internet. Think of dialup speeds, but half the time it doesn't work at all. If you absolutely need to get online, the reception only seems good in the lobby. There were also little details which were annoying. For stationery, we had no pen, and one crinkled piece of paper. There were two nice silk flower arrangements on the bed upon our arrival, which we thought was nice, but upon closer inspection, noticed that they could be our very own for only 5 Euros. The beds were mediocre (asked for a double, got two beds pushed together), and we both woke up with mysterious bites on our arms and chest. One of its saving graces is the dinner. The service wasn't good, but the food was not bad. We recommend the Turkish soup. As you can tell, we would not recommend this hotel. The location is great and the staff is fairly friendly, but it's a small trade off for somewhere nicer and a bit further away.
