Once we found our location we shook off the disappointment of the pictures we saw versus the location of hotel entrance in a walking alley. The lobby pictures are very accurate. Old world style the General Manager and staff were eager to help. There was always an English speaking person at the desk 24 hours a day.Rooms were small but typical European style. Most people forget the room is just for sleeping as you are supposed to be out seeing the sites of Venice. The desk sells the ACTV Cards which you use for the bus to and water buses in Venice. The bus stop is just a short walk from hotel. Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance of hotel along with more shopping where it appears the locals shop. Across the street is a multistory store within a super market in the basement level. the prices are very good and a great place to purchase bottled water. Locals also shop here and it is open on Sundays. If you have to have a large room I would request to see one before you book. This is a great value for location if you looking to balance costs against location.

Hotel Venezia is apparently a family-run establishment, and I found its location, proximity to transportation, decor, and level of professional service to be well worth the 75 EUR per night. They offer a very adequate breakfast buffet with a lot of choices including coffee, tea, orange juice, yogurt, ham, cheeses, fresh breads, cereal, and so on. They also have a very elegant restaurant. Although I did not eat dinner there, I did look at the menu, and their selection was very good, and the prices were especially good. Our room was very nicely decorated, and I loved the small details, like the heated towel rack and ample space to store our luggage. Of course the foyer downstairs is absolutely beautiful, and no, the rooms do not maintain this frivolity, but are still clean, decorated, and relaxing.

It was close to Mestre station and close to transport to Venice. The bus to Venice was a street away and it was a 15-20 minute bus trip to Venice. This we were happy about. The hotel advertisement showed a glitzy, expensive looking foyer which it does have but unfortunately that's where it ended. We had booked for 2 nights with a group of friends. We all paid similar internet prices but received varying standards of rooms. Our room was a reasonable sized room on the third floor, comfortable bed, comfortable room, tiny bathroom with shower that wet everything in the room (shower curtain no shower cubicle) even though our voucher said bath. On our return to Venice 10 days later just as a couple we were given a room on the 6th floor. It was tiny, not very appealing, very dated and uninviting. Even tinier bathroom. Paid same price per night as our first visit. The air conditioning was not effective so we kept the window and shutters open all night to get some air. The curtains were sheer so the lights from the busy Mestre streets kept the room very bright all night. The rooms on this floor also allowed noise from the hallway and other rooms into our room to the point that I was woken throughout the night thinking that someone was tryin g to get into our room - it was the next door guests going into their rooms. The bed was 2 single beds pushed together, with separate mattresses, sagging in the middle of each single bed. When we looked under the bed we found what looked like camp stretchers - not great for a romantic getaway in Venice. Breakfast initially had the appearance of being great but was very basic and just OK. The staff, while helpful when asked about directions etc, gave the appearance that we were a nuisance and were stopping them from getting on with other more important jobs. We were just being tolerated. Not a warm, friendly welcome, no service with a smile.

They said they have to keep them till the evening... So we had to risk traveling to Venice, the islands, without passport as we were staying for one night.

Ou room was cosy and comfortable, the hotel staff were very helpful and it was very well-placed both for Treviso airport and Venice itself. You need the XXVI Ottobre (Mestre) stop using the Ryanair Eurobus from Treviso airport (do just make it clear to the driver you want to go there as it is not used by many people and some might ignore it). The Hotel is 50m from the busstop and clearly signposted. We paid just 82Euro per night for our room which is much cheaper than any of the options in Venice itself. Our room was comfortable and breakfast (continental style) was nice enough. The trip to Venice takes about 20mins on the bus from the same bustop 50m from the Hotel (take the number 4 or 4/ to Piazalle Roma bus station in Venice which is at the top of the Grand Canal nr the train station). A Venice travel card (10.5Euro for 24hours or 22Euro for 72hours) is valid for the bus, so you can go back and forward from Venice to the hotel as many times as you want without extra cost (we tended to travel in during the day, come back to get changed and then go back into Venice at night). We never waited any more than 15mins for a bus to/from Mestre. The buses back from Venice run all night and are always very busy and safe as they transport the musicians, waiters, shop assistants etc who work in Venice, but live in Mestre. Before we went everything we heard about Mestre was bad, but we had absolutely no problem. There is a shopping centre (BarChe) with a supermarket right opposite the Hotel and a lovely town square with shops and restaurants 5mins walk away. To get back to Treviso airport we took the bus into Venice just to make sure the Ryanair transfer did not ignore us, but that was no real inconvenience.
