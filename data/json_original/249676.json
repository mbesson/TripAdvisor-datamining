It's off the main strip and across the river so every time you went anywhere it was a several miles to reach the main drag. But it provided a quiet atmosphere. We learned they offer four types of condos here. Our friends stayed in the Lodge condos. They were cramped and you could hear noises from the other condos. We stayed in the President condos and they were large and bright. We never heard anyone else except when they moved in and the door slammed. Our condo had washer and dryer and a fireplace, theirs did not. The other two levels of condos were larger than ours. The main pool was very nice, but the hot tub wasn't hot. Oddly, the sign said not to get in it if the temp was over 104 degrees but we never saw a thermometer to tell you want the temp was in the first place. The food at the Grille was moderate price and good quality. I agree with others that the condos could use a good cleaning. We had them come and mop the kitchen floor because we wiped them down once and they were filthy. We asked for them to clean the dust hanging down from the vents but housekeeping said that was the job of maintaince so we told them to wait until we checked out. The air was hard to control in the unit. We froze in the living room, were comfortable in the master bedroom and the second lock out bedroom was warm. Maintaince said it happens in those units and they had told management about it. When we remarked on it upon check out they knew about the situation but I guess they don't plan on fixing the problem. If you needed any kitchen equipment they were very quick to supply it.

When she called the Monday before we left, she was told they did not have any handicapped units and could not give her a room on the first level. She was told their policy is that handicapped people must be in a handicapped room. There are no elevators here either. She had to cancel her reservation and find lodging elsewhere. This occurred, but at a much greater expense due to the late booking and it being a holiday/special event week.

We stayed in a Presidential unit with a Friday check in. We had reserved a 2 bedroom unit, but actually had a 1 bedroom with a lockout unit. It was perfect for our teenage daughters, who enjoyed their own space. This unit slept 6.....2 bedrooms and a sofa bed in the living room. It was very spacious and had everything we needed. The kitchen was fully stocked and there was a washer & dryer as well. We had 2 big bathrooms with jacuzzi tubs in both. Our only complaint was that there was no shower! The tubs had hand held shower nozzles, but they were awkward to use. Elderly people or people with limited mobility would have difficulty getting in & out of the tubs and it would be difficult to bathe young children in these tubs as well. The condo was nicely decorated, with kind of a rustic cabin feel. The resort has several pools, one which was right by our building. It was pretty small and often crowded. The larger pool is by the golf course and was very nice, though it could get pretty full, too. There were signs posted saying no smoking or alcoholic beverages allowed. I didn't notice any rule breakers in the big pool, but lots of smoking & drinking in our small pool. I wish management would patrol that a little closer. The smoking was annoying! This is a very large resort and you do need to drive to get to most areas. The golf course looked beautiful and was very reasonably priced. We didn't pack our clubs....no room since we traveled with teenage daughters :-) The resort is a little off the beaten path, but we enjoyed that! We didn't hear the hustle & bustle of Branson.

We count on the pool and hot tub as a major part of our vacation experience so that was a huge, huge downer. OLD TELEVISIONS, AND NO DVD PLAYER OR VCR We're used to flat screens at timeshares; the TV in our second unit [we moved] was good enough; however, the charge to rent a DVD player was $6 plus tax per day! So much for Netflix movies we'd taken with us. This is more of a small town than a resort; from many units, you'd have to drive to get over to the main office and activity center. It was easy to get lost trying to find either your unit or the exit to the main highway. No free internet in rooms [although most timeshares charge for in-room internet]; access in registration/activity building which closed at 8 p.m., so people sat in the laundry room until wee small hours of the morning. No free printing or free computer to use; you could borrow a laptop from the activity center to use on site for 15 minutes to print out boarding passes, coupons, etc., but at 50 cents per page, it wasn't worth it for cheapo discount coupons like you get in Branson. Most timeshares have at least a couple of computers you can use and print from without cost in the main building. Small short-order restaurant on site; convenient, but it turned out to not be poorer quality than fast-food restaurants, and overpriced. No laundry facilities in unit. [Many timeshares provide in-unit facilities and detergent.] Our first unit was in the lodge, I think they were accommodating our request for a ground floor unit if possible. The apt. was nicely decorated, but very dark, cramped; tiny kitchen, and hard for four of us to fit in the two-bedroom unit without tripping on each other. In our bedroom, there was little storage space. The TV cabinet was devoid of its original content, leaving a huge ugly gaping hole staring at you whenever you went in the bedroom, with a tiny television perched high on top of it. The coathangers were so high that even my six-foot husband couldn't deal easily with the devices you had to connect the hangers to; I could not use it at all, and there was no footstool available [I asked for one.] TV in other rooms was also old, and bathroom in master suite was tiny. The next day, since some of our party were leaving, we sought to switch to just a one-bedroom unit, if it had bigger living space and were nicer. The management very kindly and with no grief let us move to a much newer and larger unit near the Activity Center. It was on the third floor and a bit difficult for my husband and me to haul everything up to, but it was so much nicer as to be worth the knee pain to go up and down. It had very nice decor and much more light. The resort is a few miles out of town, yet not in a particularly attractive spot; inconvenient since one had to drive around Lake Taneycomo since there wasn't a bridge over it to get to most places. There are no recycling bins on site and no info about recycling, yet a great emphasis on careful use of towels. No replacement for shampoo, soap, etc. without buying it. If you wanted midweek cleaning, you had to call to have it scheduled. In all, it seemed like the resort was trying to milk everything it could out of those who stay there.

They should have brought them to us! We got into the room and there were silverfish in the dishes on the counter. They gave us another condo and there was a real funky smell in it. We changed again (all this in the rain, mind you) and the 3rd condo seemed OK--until we returned from seeing shows. There was a guy below us smoking cigars until 1 a.m. or so and blasting loud music. I didn't bring my clean clothes to go there and have them smell like stinky cigar smoke. Then he would say, Oh, are you back? I think someone at the resort put him up to it. He talked on the phone out there until 1 a.m. also. There is a \"lights out\" policy at the resort. I can't understand why security doesn't take any action. I was going to take things into my own hands and drop water balloons on him, but he checked out. He's sure lucky. I am the water balloon queen. LOL. I will NEVER spend my money in this town again unless we stay at the other resort. Here's the other problem, although, not the fault of the resort: a cement truck drove by every 20 minutes because they were repairing the bridge. I didn't get a wink of sleep. The weather was great and we could have opened windows, but had to run the air conditioning. I was very upset about this as it drives up OUR maintenance costs. I contacted the chamber of commerce about it. They are running the trucks at night to avoid the daytime traffic. Well bull-oney! What about tourism. What about our gas money to go there for a wasted stay? That wrecked it for us. Never, never again!!! I never took a vacation all these years, maybe I was wise.

Rolling hills, a little brook, security guarded, and some nice presidential units. They have a public golf course with a grille that is convenient.

It was away from the strip and the traffic that comes with it, but close enough that it wasn't out of the way. Branson Landing was very close with a good Bass Pro Shop there. In regards to the hotel itself - I agree with previous reviews that there really isn't much insulation between floors. We listened to the people above us go back and forth until about 11pm each night. The only other negative is the shower. The shower in the master bath is a jacuzzi tub with mirrors all around....not a pretty sight at times! LOL But the temperature knobs and the shut on/off is located OUTSIDE the curtain which makes it very akward. We only made it to the smaller pool, but some other people in our party went to the larger one and said it was nice as well. The decorations were cute, and I liked the tile floor a lot.

We stayed here from Dec 22nd \u2013 Dec 29th and had a very nice stay. We were in building P in the presidential suites and stayed on the 3rd floor (A&B). The rooms were very comfortable with king sized beds, HUGE Jacuzzi spa tubs, full kitchen with a few cooking utensils and a lovely fireplace that starts the fire at the flip of a switch. The views were amazing as were most of the people that worked here. As with any place you stay at for a week, you\u2019re bound to run into a few problems. Our first problem was with the carbon monoxide and fire alarms. When we first arrived in our condo, the pressure from opening the door made one of the windows in the kitchen come open because the wind was blowing SO hard outside. So it made the room FREEZING cold when we finally got in. No big deal, we fixed it the best we could until maintenance got there to make sure it wouldn\u2019t pop open again. And why did we need maintenance other than the window? Because my parents\u2019 room in the condo next door had a broken phone and their carbon monoxide alarm was going off. Supposedly they just popped in a new battery to fix the alarm. However, the VERY last day we were there, their alarm went off again\u2026this time at TWO IN THE MORNING! The maintenance guy said that the previous guy must have put in a battery that wasn\u2019t even new. Nice, huh? Well, we had the same situation in our room too. We came back on Christmas Eve (was out getting groceries) to our alarm going off like crazy. Maintenance just popped in another battery and it took them almost 20 minutes to get there too. So, I would suggest asking ahead of time that the resorts make sure that the alarms are working properly because waking up in the middle of the night to this horrid alarm is not fun. Oh\u2026and one morning at around 9ish, the building across the way from us (building N) got a wake-up call from the FIRE ALARM! Everyone was standing outside in their PJ\u2019s wrapped in blankets. Oh\u2026I\u2019m sure they just had to change the battery on that one too. It was finally fixed about 30 minutes later. You would think that they would check all these out before they have any guests. I have never experienced such a place with so many alarms going off\u2026and all of them being FALSE!! My next complaint is the fact that all the dishes that were in the washer in my parents\u2019 unit were STILL DIRTY!! EW!!! So my parents had to do a load before they had some clean dishes. You also have to provide your own laundry detergent and dryer sheets because there aren\u2019t ANY complimentary ones. Another complaint is the smoker down the stairs from us. We were good the first couple of days and then somebody moved in downstairs and their cigarette smoke somehow flowed into our BATHROOM and for the last few days of our stay, our bathroom REEKED of smoke. GAG!!! It nearly made me sick it was so heavy. They shouldn\u2019t put smokers below non-smokers because the smoke has to go somewhere. My last complaint is with the lady who was supposed to offer you the \u201cdeals\u201d of the city. We went down there on the afternoon of Dec 23rd specifically to talk to whomever about Silver Dollar City and this lady was downright RUDE to us! She really acted like she didn\u2019t want to be there and was so snippy with us it really got to me. I was trying to be very friendly with her and chit-chat about the offers and I guess I \u201cinterrupted\u201d her in one of her \u201ctalks\u201d and she held up her finger at me to hush me up. WHAT THE???? I have NEVER been treated this way by someone who is supposed to be HELPFUL to the guests. I took my brochures and decided to go elsewhere for information. I didn\u2019t want ANY of her deals. I was going to complain to the resorts about this HORRIBLE lady, but my husband didn\u2019t want to make a big deal about it since it was the beginning of our holiday. So I decided I was just going to inform everybody about her here. I didn\u2019t catch her name, but like I said before, she was working in the afternoon on Sunday, the 23rd. This resort should really find somebody who is more PEOPLE FRIENDLY!! Everybody else we dealt with on this trip was super-nice and made the whole trip wonderful. BOO to this lady!! Other than Miss. Grinch there and the icky smoker, we had a very nice stay. I would definitely recommend it and would definitely stay there again. I would just check with the office and make sure there are ALL new batteries in all of the alarm systems. AND make sure that I\u2019m not next to any smokers. Also, if you are looking for good deals for any shows and attractions, just find a place in the city itself. There are helpful people at almost ANY place.

The unit was well appointed with dishes/pots pans, dishwasher, soap, scrubbies, garbage bags, and all small appliances (so bring your coffee/filters). It also had a small washer/dryer, and even a whirlpool tub! Outside it had patio furniture and a charcoal grill. We took advantage of most they had to offer. We did the crafts, bingo, gameroom, used the playground and the pools. We also golfed at the course. They gave us a great rate of $25 for 18 holes since we were staying there which included a cart. The normal public rate is $65. They do have junior rates available. We also noticed they moved the holes so that no 2 days golfing would be exactly the same. On a side note, they do require a collared shirt to golf there. We did have a few small issues upon check in, which were taken care of within a 1/2 hr and followed up by a courtesy call to see if everything else was ok. We thought we might be treated differently since we were not timeshare owners at this resort, but everyone was friendly and helpful and treated everyone the same. We also used the Branson concierge in the lobby for our attraction tickets to save some time and $$. We did experience some noise from the people walking around in the unit above ours, but most nights we were so tired we fell asleep anyway.

You had to use the hand held shower in the jacuzzi, and since my wife and I are both tall, we had to sit down to shower. There was a small playground and pool nearby, but the main pool up by the golf clubhouse is much larger. There are plenty of charcoal grills available if you are inclined to grill outside.

They even supplied teh dishwashing liquid, extra garbage bags and coffee. I don't know how much these units run on a nightly basis, but if competitive with others in the area I highly reccommend them.
