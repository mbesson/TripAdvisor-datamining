I found the hotel's website when I was looking for accommodation in Dubai. This is my first time in Dubai. I tried to book my dates but was told that there was no room available. I called the reservations number and was put on hold and the operator finally came back and told me that the reservations department was very busy and that if I left my name and number, they would call me back. They never did, and I should have taken this as a sign and not booked my stay. 2. I finally managed to get a booking for the night after I had initially planned on staying, for a 3 night stay. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30PM (after a 7.5 hour flight) and waited in line to check in. When I finally got to the front of the line, the person at the front office, couldn't find my reservation. I waited while I she checked the confirmation email I showed her and she told me to have a sit and wait (again). After a while, someone from reservations came to inform me that they were working on it and that they would get back to me soon. I asked for a wifi login code/password and was given one - but it didn't work. 3. Finally, this reservations person came back and told me it was all sorted and that I could proceed to check in. I made my way to the reception and it was full with 3 lines of at least 5 people in each line. Not wanting to wait as I had things to do, I gave word to the conceirge that I would leave my bags and come back for check in. 4, A few hours later, I came back to the hotel to find that the reception was even more crowded with lines of people and all the seats taken. I tried to get the attention of the different people behind the front desk but to no avail. I had to walk out to the concierge and ask them if they culd help me, but they told me to speak to the front office manager. I went to the front desk and interupted the lady I spoke to earlier and she pointed to a lady next to her. 5. The lady then told me to wait (again) and I went out to speak to the concierge again. This time someone came to help me, but he disappeared again after telling me to wait. After several minutes, he finally came out to tell me that it was all sorted, at the same time the front office manager also came over to talk to me. Then they both left me and I stood there wondering if I was ever going to get into my room. 6. I go up to the counter to ask the manager what was going on and she tells me to wait for what must be the 7th time I was told to wait. Then the person she was dealing with started complaining that he had been waiting for 2 hours. 7. I am finally brought to my room and I quickly get online to check my emails and try to get a bit of work done, and the internet doesn't work. The front office manager finally comes up to check me in and I ask her about the internet. She told me that she would go down to speak with her IT manager and fix the problem. I told her that the earlier code didn't work either and she said she would send up a new code for me. I go to have a shower and having received the new code, I try to get online - Surprise, Suprise, it doesn't work. 8. I call down and ask to speak to her and the operator tells me she's very busy with a guest. Then I ask him if I could speak to someone who can help me with the internet and he said that he would have the manager call me back. Half and hour later, I call again and the operator said that he will call me back in 15 min as they're trying to reach the IT manager. An hour later, I called again and this time the operator told me that the IT manager is out of the hotel, it's a Friday and that he can't say if the internet will get fixed, and told me to go down to the busines centre if I needed the internet. So, here I am, writing this review, online, and ironically in a hotel that has no internet because it's a Friday and the IT manager has left the hotel. You know a hotel is terrible when you start thinking about cutting your trip short cos it started out so badly. I got a one bedroom suite and it's pretty ordinary. ALL the windows face construction sites, around 3 or 4 sites, so I've had to keep the curtains drawn the whole time for privacy. . Like the Night Hotel in NY that I reviewed before, the condition of the room is not great - The dressing \"table\" is screwed into the wall and falling off, and has a black burn mark on it, dirty covers on the couch, bed is soft, none of the usual bathroom amenities, blinds that don't work, hangers in the wardrobe have hairs stuck on them (sic), wardrobe doors that don't close properly, etc. This is the 2nd time that I'm staying at a Wyndham property and I hope it's the last.

This is not a hotel, but an apartment building. The website is not giving an accurate description of the place. There is a reception and a restaurant (Orchid) which is not nice and quite small, and a swimmingpool. The breakfast is arabic, and we found the overall standard to be very poor. We had pre-payed breakfast (90 Dirham pr person pr day), but ate there only the first two days. The coffee was thin, the pastry really bad, the cheese sweaty, and the list goes on. You will be much better of going to the supermarket next door and buy what you want to eat there. Then make it in your apartment. We stayed in apt. nr 1005. The toilet clogged up, and we tried several times to get them to fix it. evetually we grabbed hold of the maid who came to clean the apt. daily, and then she called maintenance. The equipment in the kitchen lacks many things. There are two cups for coffe, two knifes, two wineglasses etc. There is a washing machine, a toaster and a micro-wave, refrigerator and water boiler. No kitchen towels. There is room service, but no menu in the rooms. We asked for it, but they didn't have it. We were told to just call room service and ask. The staff in the restaurant speak porly english, with an indian accent. The pool is heated (30 degrees? Too warm when there are 30 degrees in the shadow). There is no pool-bar. No smoking by the pool area. The pool lies in shadow until noon. At the moment there is heavy constructionwork going on, and this will continue for at least a couple of years. The staff is friendly, but this is by no means a 4-5 star place! Three elevators and 31 floors makes for waiting-time. There are mainly arabians here (at least while we were there), I would say 90% were wearing the traditional arabian clothes. We felt very out of place. The sea is quite far away, so you can hardly see it. There is a vague sight of it over the other buildings. You can see a strip of it if you consentrate. They do not answer the phone in the reception. They are nice and forthcoming, but they do not really act on our request. Even though the rooms look nice on the web-site, they do not feel luxurious. The colours aren't nice in reality. It is close to the mall, but not with direct access to it. I would give this place max. three stars, and would not return. One is probably better off renting a cheaper apartment and get what one is paying for, not expecting a whole lot. There is an excellent pizzeria near by, \"PIZZERO\". They also deliver. Their pizzas are probably among the best italian pizzas I've ever eaten.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amman, Jordan", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location.

My first experiences with this particular Ramada were good ones. Back then it was a no hassle deal for the hotel staff to provide a complementary ride to and from the airport, free use of the business office with free internet for this business traveler to use at my leisure and the counter staff was friendly and were eager to accommodate me with extra water for the room. When I arrived without a reservation the front desk did their best to find me the better room price for my stay. I came and went and could have guests without question. However, my last three stays at this Ramada have gone from awkward to very uncomfortable and now to downright unwelcoming. On one occasion I was unexpectedly charged after I had reserved complementary hotel transportation to the airport as I surprisingly found out upon arriving at the airport destination. During my next stay I brought this transportation matter to the attention of the hotel manager who was eager to make my transportation requirement to and from the airport a cost free reality after I threatened to cancel my upcoming reservations. Most recently, the counter staff told me that because I made my reservation via the internet that I would no longer be afforded hotel transportation to and from the airport and that I would need to take a taxi. Remember, I have been a regular customer at this particular hotel for awhile now. During my past three or four stays, I have had to repeatedly ask for replenished drinking water when during my early stays water and fresh fruit was always to be found in my room without having to ask. A couple of stays ago, I was informed by the desk staff that I would be charged to utilize the business office internet which would be priced at fifteen minute intervals. The final straw came when I had invited guests come to see me off while I finished packing an hour before my checkout. I was stopped by security who would not allow my guests into the hotel. Embarrassed, I confronted the desk staff and threaten to not stay there anymore. They then put their rude security guy back on his chain. I didn\u2019t even know that they had a security guy, so I am guessing that he would be a new hotel hire which will only increase the cost of staying there. This hotel\u2019s rates have gone up quite a bit over the past couple of years but the quality of customer care and service has also gone down quite a bit, I know I have been paying more for less. Now I will be staying in another hotel in Bur Dubai, one that offers good customer service and wants my business.

In general the furniture, floors, doors, amenities etc. all are tired of bad quality that could meet a 2 star to 3 star standard at best. It was advertised as burj dubai / fountain view however the view was limited somewhat. e.g. in the balcony i could see the burj from one angle only and have to look to the left of the balcony normal sitting orientation to see the fountain. The glass of the windows was not clean all over the flat. That included the glass on the balcony which obstructed visibility when sitting. The bathrooms were not clean. The towels were not very clean and of bad quality. Most importantly the water pressure in the bathroom and shower was very weak and added to the feeling that it was 2 to 3 stars service. The AC fans were noisy. Not sure about AC cooling because it was December. liked best: walking distance to Dubai mall - it is nice walk with the nice weather in December. liked least: room not ready at 3:00 PM for 2 hours and service and quality do not meet high price charged for it. overall i regretted staying in this hotel which charged me premium for a less than average service.
