The weather was a lovely 25-26 degrees around this time of year. Our train arrived into Venice at 11pm, so we arrived at the hotel quiet late. We emailed ahead and the reception stayed open for our arrival. Check in was efficient and professional. We stayed in a room on the top floor with a balcony area off it. The room had a double bed and a single. It was very quiet and comfortable. The bathroom was well maintained and clean. We loved having the balcony area. We would sit out there into the late evenings listening to the sounds of the locals play their Italian operatic music into the open air from their houses. The breakfasts were very nice, with plenty of choices. We enjoyed sitting in the outdoor dining area, eating and relaxing as the first stream of bus tours made their way into the old city. The outdoor breakfast area is set up on level 1 under a canopy of trees, so you feel very private as you watch the world wake up and start moving. The hotel location is fantastic. It is about a 10 min walk to St Marks square. This resort has a very strong family run feel, which adds to the warm feel of the place. We thought this hotel was fantastic value and highly recommend it. We have recommended it to friends who have also stayed here. They just loved it too. We will definitely return. **Attend a baroque concert held in one of their churches in the evening. It was divine. Definitely a highlight of out trip.

We stayed in the outside apartment. Technically it is still part of the building but it can only be accessed from outside the gate.

Although the apartment was next to a small street, we weren't bothered by noise nor people walking past. There was not a lot of traffic and the road was not a main thoroughfare.

It was so relaxing sitting there each morning, with those awesome cappuccino in hand, listening to someone in a nearby apartment practicing on the piano. I was a little miffed at checkout when I was told I needed to pay an extra 18 euros (approximate) in new taxes.

The bedroom and bathroom were very large by European standards and there was a kitchenette with mini fridge as well. The breakfast was good and the outdoor seating area was fantastic. We got a very good dinner suggestion from the front desk (Au Crevete I believe). I would definitely recommend this B&B to other travellers who are willing to stay a bit off the main tourist route.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cA quiet little hidden gem\u201d", "Author": "y_su58", "ReviewID": "UR64863348", "Content": "We stayed in Ca'San Rocco for three nights in May, 2010 and really liked it. It was a 5-10 minutes walk from the train station, with only two bridge crossings. It is located on a very quiet side street overlooking a nice yard (not sure if it belongs to the B&B though). Our room was really clean, spacious, with modern bathroom but the room itself has an antique look which makes it quite charming -- look luck figuring out how to open the windows! Our room even has a small balcony. The staffs were friendly but on the polite and quiet side. I kind of feel bad for the girls sitting at the tiny reception desk down the stair all day long. Our breakfasts were OK. The two days it rained in the morning, all the guests cramped into the tiny dinning area which made it uncomfortable. On the nice day though, the outdoor sitting was lovely. Overall, if you'd like to have a quiet place for the night in Venice away from San Marco, Ca'San Rocco is a nice choice. Our fond memory of staying there, other than the quietness of this little B&B, came from a great restaurant a couple of blocks away, Osteria ae Cravate.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cNo complaints!\u201d", "Author": "WhiteTara", "ReviewID": "UR56536492", "Content": "I have been going to Venice for 25 years now, but usually in the summer. This year I decided to attend Carnivale for the first time. It was enormous fun to see the costumed Venetians and enjoy the spirit of the event.... but what made it perfect, was returning each night to this quiet, slightly out of the way, bed and breakfast. Absolutely no problems here. The most wonderful thing about it was the quiet ... after all that frantic activity outside to return to a room that was large, clean, well appointed and utterly quiet was wonderful. The two sisters who run the B&B speak English and were very helpful to me when my flight was cancelled ... I went right back from the airport and they took me in again. My room was overlooking a lovely garden area, that was green even in February, but the little street outside the wall of the garden was seldom traveled. They give a good directional map, and it is close to both the rail station and Piazzale Roma, a big boon if you are a single traveler like myself with bags to schlepp. Bravo.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cLovely, friendly, clean and quiet!\u201d", "Author": "seabreeze1053", "ReviewID": "UR47632125", "Content": "We spent three nights here in October 2009 and made our decision to reserve a room here largely on the comments from the past year of Trip Advisor reviews for this hotel. The positive reviews of Ca' San Rocco were spot on. We took the airport bus to the Venice bus station, and then walked 10-15 minutes with our luggage in tow to the hotel. It was an easy walk - just two bridges. A good map is a must for navigating Venice. (We recommend the Rough Guide map) The hotel is located in a very quiet neighborhood, well lit and safe. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was very clean. The windows have an automated retractable metal shutter that not only serves to block out light when recovering from jetlag, but also does a good job of muffling the many church bells that go off everywhere throughout Venice every hour. The hotel is ten minute's walk from the closest vaporetto station. We found that we used the vaporettos (water bus/taxi) frequently and took a 72-hour pass for our three day stay. There are several small cafes and casual restaurants within five or so minutes of the hotel. The more lively areas are a bit farther walk, but not too far. Breakfast is included in your stay. Some reviewers have commented that breakfast wasn't enough - but we found they provided plenty of food. Breakfast consisted of your choice of coffee made just for you (prepared espresso, cafe latte, machiatto, cafe americano, etc) and juices. There was a selection of canned fruit, yogurts, cereals, croissants, pastries, cheeses, sliced meats, and breads. It was pretty good, if slightly repetitive after three days. Although three night's stay cost $717 (US), it was comparable to other hotels we considered, and we feel got very good value at Ca' San Rocco. We enjoyed our stay and would certainly recommend it to others!", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NewYork, NY", "Title": "\u201cDon't miss out\u201d", "Author": "tanant", "ReviewID": "UR47318304", "Content": "I agree with all of the posted reviews.

The B&B seemed recently renovated and was very clean with great amenities. Breakfast was also very good - you can either eat inside or on their terrace. I loved this B&B because it really felt as though you're staying in someone's house in a quiet neighborhood.
