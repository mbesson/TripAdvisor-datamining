We were very pleased with our stay. It's really more of a B&B than a hotel, so do not go expecting anything fancy. There are steep stairs leading to the rooms, as in many European hotels, so keep this in mind. Henk helped us with our bags. All the staff we encountered seemed to genuinely enjoy making their guests' stay as pleasurable as possible. Henk was ever present, speaking to each guest at breakfast in their native language, offering tips and suggestions and making sure everyone's coffee was topped up. Breakfast was plentiful, with cereals, fruit, hard boiled eggs, ham, cheese and a selection of breads, including very tasty, warm croissants. We stayed in Room 5 which had an expansive balcony overlooking a lovely garden - it's a shame the weather did not permit us to enjoy it much. There were a few kinks - a burn-out bulb on one side of the bed and a some towels missing on days 2 and 3, but to be fair, we did not point these things out to staff and have no doubt they would have been rectified quickly had we done so. We would not hesitate to stay here again and would recommend it highly to our friends. It was within easy walking to the Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum, especially if you cut through the Vondelpark (which is a destination in itself), and a short tram ride to Old Amsterdam, with a tram stop just steps from the hotel.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield", "Title": "\u201cLovely B&B, best smelling breakfast\u201d", "Author": "uratargetmarket", "ReviewID": "UR128014532", "Content": "I stayed in a small, single room in September 2011 for a brief, solo visit to Amsterdam whilst between jobs. As covered before, Hank is just so lovely and friendly. I was quite lazy getting out of bed and missed breakfast both days but he still brought me over some whilst I sat his computer about 11am. When I checked out, he also waived any charges for what I'd drunk out of the minibar. The B&B is in a nice, neighbourhood location. I wouldn't say it is an amazing location if you are older or don't like walking. The tram stop isn't that far away at all, but unfortunately for me that tram stop was closed when I stayed at Hotel Zandbergen. My only one small criticism of the B&B is that when I booked with them I asked for directions from the airport (using the trams) and they never did think to tell me that tram line was shut- which meant I got quite lost for an hour or so on my way to check-in. Other than that though- you can't really fault the place. My room was small but perfectly pleasant and well kept. Comfy bed and good TV. Well stocked mini bar. You're not staying at a top hotel, this is a family run B&B. But in terms of \"you get what you pay for\" you absolutely get value for money here.

We were really impressed by the professionalism and friendliness of the manager Henk, and his staff , Anita, Elena and Tessa. Their local knowledge, advice and overall willingness to assist was extremely helpful.Breakfast was well presented and more than adequate with a section of ham, cheese, bread, croissants, billed eggs , fruit and cereals. Coffee and tea were always available free of charge. We also appreciated free wifi access. There is no lift and the stairs are extremely steep so if this presents a problem maybe request a first floor room.Having said this Henk kindly carried one of our bags upstairs. The exceptional service tends to override the few shortcomings of the rooms. Our room although extremely clean did look tired and needed an 'update' . The bed was very large and positioned against the wall with no room for a bedside table, making it necessary to climb out of the bottom of the bed.Many of the wall lights did not work nor did the hairdryer- however we did not in fairness comment about this to management as this was not a problem for us.Overall a very pleasant stay as the hotel is in a very good centrallylocated area with lots of great eating places and easy access to major attractions. Simply could not fault the professionalism and generosity of the staff. Tip: the hotel ordered us a taxi to the wharf which turned out to be a private transfer service. The cost of the trip was more than expected at 23 euros. This was not an issue but when the driver was offered 30 euros in two notes he said he had no change. When we offered to round it up to 25 euro and for him to provide us a 5 euro note he still insisted he had no change. Luckily we found some small change otherwise we would have had no choice but to offer him a exorbitant 7 euro tip, which may have been his preferred option.

Otherwise out the front door turn right down to the first interstection turn right and 50m up on your left is a great Italian resturant on a corner.

At the end of your stay give the card back to 'Henk' at the hotel and he will reimburse you 10E for each card!).

We were able to catch the train from the airport to Central Station and then take the #2 tram, basically to the hotel's front door. It was very easy to get to and just minutes from the center of town. We rented the penthouse which was lovely and had an amazing view. There was plenty of space for the 4 of us. The entire staff's customer service was top notch. Henk also knows the city extremely well. His recommendations were spot on. 2 of the highlights of our trips were recommendations from Henk: 1. The Public Library - literally the best library we've ever seen. We hung out in the library twice. Trust me, you've gotta visit. 2. The Blue boat canal tour was excellent!. We were well taken care of. We were only actually supposed to stay at the Hotel Zandbergen for 2 days (3/24-3/36), and then fly out to Abu Dhabi on the 26th. However, when we arrived at the airport on Monday, March 26th to fly to Abu Dhabi on Lufthansa airlines, my wife and I were told that although our passports were sons' passports weren't valid \"enough\". We were told that although our passports were valid, our boys' passports weren't. Their passports are valid until April 23, 2012, and we return to the states on April 12th and were told that all of our passports were fine for travel. That's besides the point. Back to why we LOVE Hotel Zandbergen. When Lufthansa refused to make an exception on the passport issue and refused to change our flight to the next day, we immediately called Henk and explained the situation. Henk, knew exactly what to do. He told us to take a cab back to the hotel and where he'd be waiting outside to grab all of our luggage so that we could continue on to the Consulate. Henk said that we needed to drop off all of our luggage because the consulate wouldn't allow you to have anything but your ID. He was right. We were able to get emergency passports for our boys and booked another flight on another airline to reach Dubai/Abu Dhabi. We were able to stay an additional day at the wonderful Hotel Zandbergen and in lovely Amsterdam, where the weather was simply beautiful. If it were not for ALL of Henk's assistance with the advice on how to navigate the consulate and rebooking us in his hotel To top it off, the accommodations were spacious with the great views, the breakfast was healthy, plentiful and coffee was delicious.

It was my wife's birthday and they also provided her with some flowers and a nice bottle of drink which made the stay even more homely. The hotel itself was good - we had opted for the larger apartment, and the rooms were comfortable, well serviced and clean with daily maid service. The decor is a little dated so if you like your surroundings a touch modernistic you may be disappointed, bit there is free wireless available, and Henk also tells me that an extensive re-furb will be carried out soon. There are some steep stairs to negotiate, that are typical of the city - something to bear in mind. Breakfast was of the basic cereal/croissant/ham and cheese variety, but all perfectly adequate and with the staff's personal service in evidence. Location is just south of the main city, but very near the main museums and walkable. There is a tram stop just by the hotel that is very convenient and will take you into the city if you forget your walking shoes!

The hotel is located in a nice neighbourhood, with a few cafes and bars, within walking distance of the Van Gogh museum and a tram ride away from the centre.

Perfect when you are out sightseeing all day and need somewhere comfortable and clean to sleep at night. The hotel is in an old house and the room was on the top floor, so this involved climbing some steep stairs. We didn't mind the exercise and felt that this added to the charm, but I could see that this would not be everyone's cup of tea. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and there was plently to eat at the breakfast. The fresh croisants were a definite bonus. The only minor glitch we had was with the booking. We had booked and paid by telephone and confirmed a late arrive (between 22:00 and 23:00). We were told that this was OK and received an email from the hotel confirming the reservation. On arrival we were told by the reception staff that they had no record of our booking. The staff were very helpful and thankfully there was a room available.

The location for me was ideal as i could choose to have a picnic in the park across the street, dine at any one of the fabulous cafes in the neighborhood, or go around the corner to the wine shop and grocery store and prepare my own meal back at the hotel. A quick tram ride and i was right in the center of town. I cant say enough good things about this place. I have already booked in for my next vacation and i am bringing my sisters with me so they can enjoy the same hospitality i did.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gulf Coast", "Title": "\u201cPersonal Touch\u201d", "Author": "dfwstrider", "ReviewID": "UR110149504", "Content": "As has been mentioned, accomodations are clean, tram stop is steps away, museum district is a short walk from the hotel.

Concert hall, the most popular museums, Leidseplein and Museumplein are within walking distance. As are restaurants serving fresh and healthy foods (Amsterdam is packed with fast-food outlets).

We had the quad room which was exceptionally clean. There was a large flat-screen tv which showed BBC2 (handy when we got in at night to wind down to) and patio doors leading to a terrace with table and chairs. The only slight negative is that two of the four beds were very soft; this was fine for me but woudln't be much fun if you need a firm mattress. Breakfast was an excellent continental selection - delicious ham and cheeses, pastries, cereal and hot boiled eggs. Great coffee too and a huge range of teas. The hotel has two tram stops within a couple of minutes walk (both for the No 2 tram). This will take you right the way up to Central Station. If you don't have too much luggage, I'd advise getting the train from the airport to Central Station (3.60 Euro) then buying a public transport pass from there for the duration of your stay (these work out really good value) then hop on the Number 2 tram to Cornelis Schuytstraat - get off and you'll see the 'Hotel' sign outside Zandbergen 30 secs walk ahead of you. We used the trams constantly throughout our stay - for a group of Brits used to expensive, unreliable public transport they were a breath of fresh air! Just another point, before our trip I checked the (very rare) negative reviews of this hotel. One of them stated that the Zandbergen was not close to the Vondelpark - I think the reviewer must have taken a wrong turn!

The bath was so small that I could get my shoulders, knees or feet in, but not all 3 together! The stairs to the bedrooms are very steep and older guests would certinly struggle. The breakfast room at the Zandbergen is bright but also small - it would not hold all guests at once! Breakfast is laid out on a 'sideboard' where space is limited. There is a reasonable choice of juice, fruit, cereals, bread and rolls, with ham and a couple of cheeses. It was perfectly acceptable but nothing special. The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful, quickly sorting out any problems. There are some good, expensive, local restaurants and a lovely brown cafe/pub. It is 10 mins walk to the museums and the canal stop but too far to walk to the centre. The tram is close but at 2 euros 60 for a single journey, this is not cheap.

Service: Breakfast was great. The usual drinks, bread&toast, eggs, cheese, cold cuts and salmon were available. They gave us excellent directions for sightseeing. They also did one basket of laundry for us for 7.5 Euros. I especially appreciated that they promise to finish the laundry on the same day before we leave for Prague. So we just dropped off the laundry with them around breakfast time, then checked out of the hotel, left the luggage with them, and come back later to pick up the luggage and laundry before heading to the train station. Couple minor things ... 1) The hotel was not in the main drag of Amsterdam but still very accessible. It is very close to the museums. But if you are interested in the train station + red light district area, then it is a bit out. I, personally, love the location. 2) The bedroom of the penthouse is facing the main street. I had no problem with street noise but one night some people were out in a nearby pub and were a bit noisy. Overall, we really liked the hotel, its service and its location.

We had the quad room, which is on the first level of the hotel (below the lobby). Our room was much bigger than we expected and contained 4 single, comfortable beds. It was very spacious by European standards and had a nice flat screen TV, which actually had some chanels in English the kids could watch at night. There was a sliding door and patio off the room, which was shared with the room next door. The breakfast was nice, however the assortment was not good as some of the other hotels we stayed at during the trip. The hotel was very close to the tram stop and we were able to walk easily to Van Gogh and Vondlepark. The owner was also genuinely friendly and very helpful with planning the day and recommending places to eat with the kids. He also did not charge us for the mini bar items we used (which were very reasonably priced) and said \"they were on the house\". Never heard that before! The lobby had a computer with free internet access. This was great for quick look ups, checking email and ticket purchasing. These are the pros. The only negatives I would have are that this room (and 2 others) are directly below the lobby. Which means that in the morning, you hear footsteps from 7 am onward (breakfast area above) and also on a few nights where we turned in before 9 pm with the kids, we could hear everyone coming home for the night. Most of this was resolved by asking for a fan to block out some of the sound. The only other con was the bathroom. It was beautiful and looked to be completely re-done very recently.....but for some reason had black mold on the ceiling and wall tiles in some places. I couldn't figure why they would have a nice brand new bathroom and not bother to clean this? Also the white cloth shower curtain was too long for the tub and hence was soaking wet after each shower. The bottom 12 inches was yellow and smelled very musty from not drying properly. I didn't want to touch it. Again, very easily resolved if given the time. The towels seemed old/thin. Bathroom items, such as soap/shampoo/faceclothes, were not replaced when empty on several occassions. I think the price we paid was a little steep, but overall I would recommend it as a good place to stay for a few nights.

Henk has a good eye for detail and makes sure everything is spot on. The hotel is near an entrance to vondelpark, a few minutes walk to the museumplein or ledseplein, a 15 minute tram journey to central station. My only gripe : although the hotel is on a quiet street with little traffic, if you have a room facing the street then any traffic noise from the street seems to be accoustically amplified and in the room it's much noisier than it should be, even with the windows closed. I believe it's only the single rooms which are affected as the other rooms overlook the quiet little garden at the back, but you might want to check with the hotel before reserving a room (to make sure it's not facing the street) if this noise is likely to bother you.

The Hotel Zandbergen does that at every turn. Yes it's spotless, yes the rooms are bigger than expected. The bathrooms are well equipped, the towels big and plentiful. The breakfast is terrific and the staff fantastic. But it's not the sum of its parts that makes the Zandbergen so great. It's the total experience. At breakfast when Henk (the owner) makes your coffee and asks you about your plans for the day, he's not being polite, he's looking for ways to help. Ways to avoid the lines at the Van Gogh? Henk's got it covered. Children visiting the Nemo? Henk tells you to have lunch next door at the terrace on the top floor of the Amsterdam Library (incredible food, views and value). My wife thought he may have had Swiss hotel training and bought this after a decade or so with a top flight organization. I never remembered to ask him. Yes the hotel is great but what makes it special is that Henk and his staff makes it the very core of an Amsterdam visit. It's comfortable, quiet and clean but it's also effortless. I'd much rather stay here than the more prestigious hotels in town (I refuse to call them better). I've stayed in some of them. They're fine but none of the warmth and uniqueness of the Zandbergen.

There are fine restaurants and services within a block or two but it's easy to get to the center for more. The only issue for older folks are the stairs. Amsterdam stairs are always steep and narrow. And there's no elevator here but the staff will help you and there are ground floor rooms. We actually stayed in two places while there, both the penthouse (a real treat and very big by any standard) and the basement family room. We also got a look at a small double next door. They're all great and all a bit bigger than what you get in most of Amsterdam. Oh and the price for doing your laundry is a great value.

As far as my fellow travelers commenting on the size of European hotels rooms, I have to say what do you expect??? First of all, you are in Europe on vacation. How much time are you really spending in your room? I want a room to sleep and take a shower, period. I don't spend thousands of Euros to spend alot of time in my hotel room. Secondly, you are in Europe. Buildings are much older and usually smaller. Third, Hotel Zandbergen is located in a narrow canal house--what exactly were you expecting? I have travelled several times to Europe and it simply amazes me how many people complain about the size of their hotel rooms. If you are judging a hotel by the size of the rooms, perhaps you should book at the dreary, uninspiring large chain hotels next time. Oh well, off of my soapbox.

We were very nervous because it seemed so out of the way from the Centraal area. The tram went through the center of town for a good 15-20 mins and we walked out to a completely quiet, pleasant, seemingly deserted part of town next to Vondelpark.

The room was fairly open and large with a couch, a desk, two twin beds, a 27\" flatscreen TV mounted in front of the beds, mini-bar and two closets. The bathroom was small but well appointed. The window was large and when we opened it the next day, it opened to the view of a small, quaint garden in the back with a small terrace and beautiful flowering trees and evergreens.

During breakfast, Henk gave us advice on the museums (which are walking distance) and a free concert during lunch time. He was knowledgeable and offered many good local tips. The hotel has tickets to the nearby museums so you don't have to reserve ahead and would be able to skip the lines. (Please confirm this with Henk ahead of time since this may change.) My friend and I already bought the IAMsterdam card so we had access to the museums and free transport already. We still had to wait on a fairly long line at the Van Gogh Museum with the IAMsterdam card. Since Centraal area hotels/b&b/hostels are either too expensive or dirty, I would highly recommend Hotel Zandbergen. The location is not bad at all--especially since couple of trams and buses go there. We could have taken a bus directly to Hotel Zandbergen from the airport instead of taking the train to Centraal station since the hotel is located half way between the airport and Centraal station. This is cheaper and may be a good option.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery pleasant place with a great proprietor\u201d", "Author": "francine_r", "ReviewID": "UR61342139", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights with my partner on a short break to Amsterdam.

A small room refrigerator was also stocked with wine, water, beer and a few snacks. The room was well thought out with regards to space, there was not an over abundance of unusable space. Everything one would need was right there perfectly placed. Downstairs in the public area was a delight with Henk my host graciously offering coffee and suggestions as to how to handle the jet-lag. They all worked!! Breakfast the next morning was delicious with something for every taste. The computer was put to good use as was the free Wi- Fi. Henk helped with directions and suggestions for the best use of my time in seeing what I wanted to see. There are some wonderful little restaurants and cafes in that area of Amsterdam. Just walk down the street in any direction. Look out for the people on bicycles.....they aren't looking out for you!!! When plans necessitated a one night stay back in Amsterdam before flying home a week later, I again booked the Zandbergen and was upgraded to a larger room with no stairs for my, by then, battered knee. Such a kind gesture from my new friend Henk and the rest of the staff at this hidden gem of a B+B. Dutch Hospitality at it's best!! There are people of all nationalities staying at this B+B. One does not feel surrounded by americans, instead the opportunity exists to meet many interesting people and learn something new.

We had a back bedroom and although small, the room was fabulously clean and a good sized bathroom. We had two beds pushed together, a good sized dressing table, a T.V. and huge wardrobe. The room was up two flights of extremely steep stairs as this is a canal house, which added to its charm but we just managed with two carry on cases. The tram is 50 meters down the road and a good tip is to buy the I AMsterdam card (EURO 58 or EURO 52 per person for 3 days, if you buy on line). We deliberated about this, but worked out we saved about EURO 250 altogether, expecially if you need a tram to your hotel every day. This price included every museum, tram and bus and also a free 1.5 hour canal cruise. The only two things we paid for, was Anne Franks house and the hop on hop off bus. The breakfast at the hotel was plentiful for a continental breakfast and replenished all the time. You can buy a bottle of wine for EURO 9.95 from the reception (with free Pringles!!) which was less than half the price we were paying in restaurants and pubs. There are two local Tapas bars but one is extrememely expensive and one excellent. The excellent one from the hotel - turn right , take the first right (past a restaurant called Spring), cross over the road and take the first left. The Tapas bar is on your right. We found it much cheaper to eat in the centre of town. A good restaraunt is on Spui and called Rancho (an Argentinian). They do a tourist menu for EURO 8.85 (when you are there, you will realise how cheap this is!!) with steak to die for. We went a few times. If you get the I AMsterdam card, they give you a voucher for a EURO 22.99 meal for EURO 16.95 but the tourist menu is as good. Nothing is too much trouble for the hotel staff. They will advise you where to go and when, sell cheaper tickets for the attractions and make fabulous coffee when you return freezing cold. (Dropped to minus 6 last week). We had a fabulous 4 days and can't wait to do it again. The only negative points for us personally were - Hermitage Museum is shut until 5th March 2010, The Rijks Museum is being renovated and only showing a small amount of art (1 hour to get around) and there are two rooms in the Anne Frank House being renovated at the moment. Check with all these on line before you go. Another lovely idea is the Candlelight cruise in the evening. Cheese and wine and a courier pointing out the sights.

I have stayed in Amsterdam a few dozen times and have experienced a range of hotels from one star to four stars, so I have a pretty good reference point for this city. I think this property has many different rooms and your experience would be directly proportionate to the nature of your room. Unfortunately, my experience is not reflective of the other reviews and like drslamb I really question the methodology that puts this hotel in the top ten in Amsterdam. The first mistake was mine -- I should have noticed how far the hotel is from the center. While the hotel is just on the #2 tram line, the trams stop at 00.30 (12.30am) so if you stay out late plan to take a taxi or a long walk (I'd say 30 minutes from the Leidseplein). In addition, there is something nice about staying in the canal rings in Amsterdam and this is far from the canal rings. Second, I got an unbelievably small room (and I am used to small rooms) that was facing onto the main road (Willemsparkweg) so I could hear all the traffic and trams. The bathroom was such that the shower was integrated into the bathroom itself so that once you showered the entire floor was covered in water. The toiletries were basically nonexistent except for some shower gel in the wall dispenser. The towels and linens were fine and the bed was comfortable. I had no trouble sleeping -- I kept the window closed to keep out the noise. There was sufficient closet space so I got my luggage out of the way to make more room. The TV was set uncomfortably above the bed and I did not watch much TV. And the wireless internet service worked intermittently and could not be relied upon for business purposes. Now on the positive side, the staff are incredibly helpful and the manager Henk is as charming and courteous as the earlier reviewers have said. The breakfast was typical Dutch breakfast -- meats, cheeses, hard-boiled eggs, breads, rolls + croissant, cereals, coffee, tea, milk, juices -- and Henk made sure the newspaper was sitting on your table. The service was very good. But unfortunately, the location away from the center and the small room could not be corrected by Henk's genuine service. As indicated earlier, it looks like there was some very nice larger rooms (including ones with terraces or gardens that faced away from the road) that are probably worth the extra cost.

I think that's because the manager (owner?) and the people who work there are all so nice. They bend over backwards to make your stay comfortable and to help you plan your day. The hotel is very pleasant and there was nothing wrong with it... but I find it's rating of 7 out of all hotels in Amsterdam an exaggeration. I would certainly go back and know what I was getting, but I might try something else too. In fact, 12 years ago I stayed at Seven Bridges and I think it was in a lovelier location (near the canals). So here goes with this review -- the room I stayed in was very pleasant and very clean. It was large enough and it had a nice terrace outside. The breakfast in the morning is fine, with hardboiled eggs, cheeses, ham, croissants, cereals, and fruit -- coffee of course. There are phones and TVs in the room. I thought the bathroom was quite large for a small hotel. There is also internet service in the room (free) as well as on the computer in the lobby. The only reason I might stay elsewhere is to be closer to the canals. This hotel is in a safe and lovely neighborhood near Vondelpark. and the museums. The park is great but it's nicer to walk around the canals. This can be done easily enough but you need to take a 15 minute walk first through the park to get to that area. The tram stops right outside of this hotel and it's easy to get anywhere in Amsterdam... so you can take the tram to nicer places to walk. It's also nice to rent a bike, but once again, you have to walk through the park to Leidseplein to rent a bike. You do get the feeling you're a little bit on the outskirts of the city even though it's in the city. All in all, I might stay here again...but I also might go back to Seven Bridges. I think they're comparable but the location makes a different. If you do stay at Hotel Zandbergen, go to the nice tapas restaurant a few blocks away. We thought that was exceptional!... go South to the end of the block, and then take a left and walk 2 or 3 blocks and it's on your left. And if you look for a Reizstafel (rice table) at an INdonesian restaurant -- I think it's better to order separate small dishes than to let them figure out what 12 dishes go together... That's all.

No stairs to be negociated, apart from the entry set. I recommend asking for this room - room 19 if you have mobility issues and can manage the 6 or 7 steps into the hotel.

What you will get at a decent 3 star hotel is a clean, comfortable room with en-suite bath, a daily breakfast, and (in the case of the Zandbergen) a pleasant getaway in the genteel neighborhood adjacent to Vondelpark. We chose the hotel based on its consistently high ratings and reasonable nightly tariff. February is off-season, but Amsterdam is popular year-round for tourists, so rates are not as discounted as in other more seasonal destinations. We got a double room with breakfast for 125 Euro/night. Our flight from North America arrived at Schiphol Airport in the early morning, and we caught the popular Connexxion hotel shuttle service to the hotel, arriving shortly after 9 AM. We'd contacted the hotel previously about our early arrival, and although they couldn't promise us a room, we were encouraged to check in and at least drop off our bags. As it turned out, a room was available for us when we arrived. We enjoyed a fresh croissant and some coffee, after which we took a sorely-needed shower to freshen up after our overnight flight. The Zandbergen occupies two adjacent three-storey buildings, but as is typical of Amsterdam architecture, the buildings are quite narrow. The hotel does not include an elevator and the stairs to the second and third floors are exceptionally steep. Visitors with mobility problems will be challenged to schlep bags from street level to the guest rooms. Once upstairs, don't expect a lot of extra room in your room. Space is at a premium and our hotel room, although adequate in every way, was quite small. The very comfortable double bed took up most of the floor space, with a tiny desk and closet occupying most of the remaining area. The bath was similarly cozy, and included a miniature tub/shower combination, a toilet, sink, and a long shelf on which we could perch our toiletries. Although our room was among the smallest I've ever occupied, the space was well-utilized and everything was of good quality and in fine working order. From our third floor window we gazed across the hotel's rear courtyard area to the yards and windows of adjacent homes. The Zandbergen is located in the Oud Zuid / Museumplein area of Amsterdam. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the Concertgebouw, Rijksmuseum, and Van Gogh museum, and perhaps 15-20 minutes to the Leidseplein area. Vondelpark is just two blocks from the hotel. The neighborhood is a tree-lined mix of shops, upscale restaurants, and gentrified homes. Not nearly as lively as the area closer to the center of town, it is nevertheless a vibrant, non-touristy part of town and a pleasant break from the omnipresent crowds of tourists in the center. Our return flight left very early in the morning and we were unable to use the shuttle service, so we arranged for a cab to pick us up. The fixed fare from the hotel to Schiphol is 30 Euros - significantly less than the 50+ Euros you'll spend to get from the airport to the center of town. Staff at the hotel were unfailingly pleasant and helpful. They put out a pretty decent breakfast of cereal, croissants and bread, fruit, juice, and coffee or tea, all of which can be enjoyed in the hotel's cheerful breakfast room. In addition, we got some good advice regarding day trips from Amsterdam, as well as recommendations for restaurants in the area. All in all, the staff were a real asset to the hotel.

My wife and I recently stayed there the weekend before driving to Germany for business meetings. We were looking for someplace reasonably priced, clean, well run and convenient to a tram line. The Hotel Zandbergen easily met those requirements. The hotel is located on Willensparkweg in a residential neighborhood. This is a high rent district of Amsterdam where very expensive automobiles are commonplace. Neither my wife nor I found this neighborhood to be nearly as busy as some previous reviewers have indicated. The hotel is a two-minute walk from either the Emmastraat or Cornelis Schuytstraat tram stops on Line 2. A tram comes by every 10 minutes and will quickly take you to any place in Amsterdam in 10- 15 minutes. If you were so inclined to walk to Central Station, it would take about 35 minutes. The appeal of the Zandbergen is that it is NOT in the middle of Amsterdam where hoards of noisy tourists and traffic rob the city of its charm. (TIP: If arriving from Schipol, take the train to Station Amsterdam South [World Trade Center], get on Tram 5 towards Amsterdam and get off at the Van Baerlestraat stop. Get on Tram 2 toward Sloten [away from Amsterdam] and go three stops to Emmastraat). The Zandbergen is in a typical Amsterdam dwelling with steep, narrow staircases and no elevator. Older or less fit folks with heavy suitcases could have some issues if no one is around to help. Our very clean, moderately sized room had a nice double bed with comfortable linens. The spotless bathroom was medium sized with modern fixtures and bright, clean tile. There was plenty of closet space. The TV had BBC1 and BBC2 and several other channels in English subtitled in Dutch. Our room even had a large balcony measuring about 16 square meters that looked upon a quiet courtyard. Breakfast was always fresh and ample, and the coffee was fabulous. The owner of the hotel, Henk, is one of the more pleasant people you will encounter anywhere. He is the consummate professional and a wealth of knowledge. And he truly understands service. As an example, one morning I came down right at 0700 for breakfast. Henk was still in the process of setting up. He stopped everything just to make me a cup of coffee without me having to ask. I even received an email from Henk a few days after we departed thanking us for our stay. The Hotel Zandbergen is not a luxury hotel. There are plenty of those in Amsterdam if that is what you are looking for. It is, however, a clean, comfortable and quiet place to stay just a few minutes removed from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam. I found it to be a good value and would not hesitate to return on my next visit to Amsterdam. (p.s. If you are looking for a true culinary delight, then do NOT miss Spring Restaurant. It is a two-minute walk from the Zandbergen on the corner of Willensparkweg and Cornelis Schuytstraat.

My husband and I stayed there for 2 days mid-October and again one day the end of October. We had met in Amsterdam for a 2 week vacation, and returned there to go our separate ways. He works abroad. Prior to departing the US, I had contacted the hotel on a few occasions to make and later to firm up our reservations. Each time, my faxes and/or emails were answered almost immediately with an always pleasant response. Upon arrival, we were instantly impressed by the friendly owner, Henk, who welcomed us with a smile. I had a huge and heavy bag, he grabbed it and took it up the stairs before we knew it! That was the beginning of a warm and wonderful experience for us at this lovely hotel on a beautiful tree-lined cobblestoned street. Our room was clean, bright, cheerful and comfortable. The double size bed was great, no lumps or bumps. We rested well. The view from our window was a lovely garden with a pathway winding thru it. The room temp. was just right. Plenty of towels, soap, shampoo, etc. A blow dryer was also furnished. The electric fan in the room wasn't really needed by us. The breakfast, which was included at no charge, was **delicious**. There was a nice array of fruits, muffins, fresh bread for toasting, boiled eggs, cereals, juices, coffee....you name it! And all served in a cheerful and clean dining area, with freshly pressed linens, near a window that looked out upon the quaint street, Willemsparkweg. Everyone was so accomodating, and we were reminded of the good old days when the customer always came first. They still do at this hotel. When we mentioned the problem of communication we'd had with the hotel in Paris because we don't speak French, Henk immediately called and confirmed our reservations for us...in French! It was as if he and his staff could not do enough for us. The location of the hotel is really great. It is exactly 175 steps (I counted) to the tram pick-up point. Just hop on the number 2 to go a few stops to the Rijks museum and a few more to the Van Gogh museum. Or take a 10 minute ride to the Centraal Railway Station where you can get a tram to almost anywhere in Amsterdam, or a train to almost anywhere in Europe. Very convenient for tourists and it's easy to understand the schedules too. On our return trip a few weeks later, we'd gotten caught up in the Rome air traffic controllers strike and our flight was cancelled, so we were a day late arriving. Before we left Rome, I was sick and was SO comforted in knowing that we would be returning to the Zandbergen, where I knew good people would get help for us if we needed it. It is a little frightening being in a foreign country and getting sick. Henk and staff were very gracious about our delayed arrival and were able to accomodate us when we did arrive a day late. It was late in the evening when we arrived, and I was feverish. The desk clerk was an angel. She fixed me a pot of hot tea, put my husband in touch with a physician within minutes, got a cab for him right away to go and pick up medication and translated the instructions for the meds to him. All in all, what could have been a frightful experience was really not much of a problem at all because of the compassion and kindness of Henk and the wonderful staff at the Zandbergen. After all, employees handle situations as they are trained to do, and the night clerk was very well prepared help us, and for that we thank her and her employer. Everyone there went far beyond the call of duty, and I'm sure we are not in the minority. If you stay at Hotel Zandbergen, I am confident that your experience with be just as phenomenal as ours was. We told them if we ever have another chance to visit Amsterdam, we would not want to stay anywhere but the Zandbergen. And that is a sincere sentiment for us. I have to tell you, I have mixed feelings about leaving this review. I know it will improve Hotel Zandbergen's score, and it would not surprise me to see that this hotel has become the #1 top rated hotel in Amsterdam very soon. But if that happens....they'll be so booked that we won't be able to get reservations there in the future! All I can say is, you will not regret it if you decide to stay at this hotel. We send our warmest regards to **all** of the folks there, and we thank them for taking such good care of us. P.S....

Hotel location was pretty good, in a pleasant up-scale neighborhood a bit away from the center of town. The tram goes right by the hotel, and the Van Gogh and Rijks museums are a 10 minute walk away. It was nice to be away from the crowds in the city center. I must say that I am surprised at the very high ranking the hotel received (#6 in Amsterdam as of middle of 2007). While the hotel was fine, I would be surprised if it was the 6th best hotel in all of Amsterdam. Maybe this says something about the other Amsterdam hotels. I think one reason for the high rating is that no one had anything particularly bad to say about the hotel. No one said it was fantastic, but no one had any major complaints. (There is the possibilty that the owners wrote positive reviews to increase their rating, but I doubt this. What I read in the other reviews sounds honest, and I would agree with what they wrote).

It's close to the art museums, but from the \"fun stuff\" it's a distance. Normally not a big deal because the tram stop is close to the hotel, but the trams stop running at midnight and bus service after that time is spotty.

The B&B lies between Museumplein and Vondelpark. The neighborhood is residential and very very quiet. There are two tram stops on the #2 line within about 100 feet of the front door. The #2 runs to Centraal Station and just about anywhere else you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to want to go in the city center. The longest it took us to get to Centraal Station was about 18 minutes.

Booking: I searched the internet for a reasonable deal. Some hotels I used to stay became too expensive like Golden Tulip or the experience was terrible like Eden Best Western. I found good reviews about Zandbergen Hotel and I called them by phone. I realized later that if for me was a comfortable time to call in Amsterdam was 7AM. Nevertheless, a feminine voice answered promptly. I explained what I wanted, a single room, quiet, higher floor, no smoking, no pets. And, that I would rather not put my credit card on their Internet site. To my surprise, the front desk kindly agreed. The next day, I called again and sent all the information by fax. They promptly confirmed my reservation by e-mail. So far, so good. The airport arrival: I went directly to the Tourist Information Center in Amsterdam Airport. I asked for a shuttle bus return ticket for Zandbergen Hotel. The lady at the desk had no clue where the hotel was. I told her to call (I had the phone no.) and she answered that a local call is too expensive. (Stunning answer !). Finally, she looked on the Internet and found the exact address. Travel by minibus OK. Hotel arrival: on the right hand side of the door is an interphone. You have to call the front desk in order to open the door. (for this reason, is good to inform them in advance your estimated arrival time). In the lobby, surveillance cameras. Very good security. At the entrance hall and near the front desk plenty of leaflets with Amsterdam attractions. (I stayed in Hilton Amsterdam a few days ago and they did not have such a collection). Front desk: at the front desk a fair hair lady was working: the Owner. Very polite she confirmed the reservation and checked the credit card. My room was on the third floor and in no time to my embarrassment she took my hand luggage and carried it to the room. My \"hand luggage\", I think, was weighing more than 12 kilos ! In the reception room is a computer with Internet access. The keyboard is clean. But no antivirus or anti-spyware programs present. A bit unsafe. I told the owner about that, the answer was not convincing. The steps to my room: were steep and rather narrow especially with my 25 kg. suitcase. Some reviewers complained about that and I can confirm. If you are in a wheelchair or pregnant in the last month is not for you. But, if you ask help probably they woud provide. The room: I had a room facing backyard that is an immense garden between the buildings. The room was very quiet. Size: On the smaller side. Some paint peeling, but very discrete. A very large bed (double - at reception I was told that I was upgraded). Very good ! Closet rather old. The carpet very clean, I could walk bare foot. What a relief\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6The window very large looked directly into the bathroom's door. Beware young couples ! In the closet a blanket that did not smell of dump (very nice surprise) and I used during the chilly night. The lighting above the desk strange and ugly. The TV set (rather old) somewhere at over 2 meters on the wall ! Above the bed and practically under your pillow, the light switches and an electric socket (200 V). Dangerous and bizarre position. Do not go in bed with wet hair, metal clips or allow kids with metallic toys. Some electric short may happen earlier than in 1000000 years. The room has a dial-up connection that is obsolete and it seems that has a wireless also. I did not check the wireless though. The bathroom: rather large given the room's size. With a huge mirror. In the bathtub a rubber carpet to protect against losing your footing. Very good for elderly. No mold even on the shower curtain. Very clean everywhere. The bathroom's amenities kit correct and very nice arranged. I got an electronic key for the door and that should be also be used for the street door. I had the laptop with me with a lot of data but I left it in my room. I felt I was in a very safe environment. ( keep the key with you at all times). Dinner: the owner explained a bit about the area and I went out. At the right at the first street corner I found a Brasserie that served a nice chicken salad and a good beer for a good price and friendly service. The Italian restaurant that I found in the neighborhood was empty and did not appeal to me. Searching for a dinner place I could see the area bit. It seems that is not mixed, only a single minority is living there (I won't mention which, in order not to offend anyone). The area has a lot of character even is rather far from the center), with lots of small shops. I have to say that I felt safe even after sun set. Returning, I passed the hotel and stopped at the other corner (left of the hotel). There is a lively bar there with a lot of conversations going on. On the front street, a tram that takes you directly to the Central Station. Breakfast: correct and good. The breakfast room is practically connected with the reception room. On the wall real pictures and drawings by local artists. One drawing inappropriate by my taste, shows a chair thrown through the kitchen's window. Criticism is rather difficult in this hotel: do not forget that the owners live also in this house ! On the tables, real flowers. I was touched. What wasn't functional: the coffee machine. Something huge, like an industrial one with lots of push buttons. You had to call the receptionist to operate it ! Cut all the appetite. A small hot plate with easy operation could have more charm and use. Also no decaffeinated available. I met the Owner (the male). I explained my opinion concerning the switches and the socket under the pillow. His is not very patient in listening clients' opinions as one reviewer pointed out and also his explanation was poor, about expensive investment etc. That talk was a kind of disappointing for me. Telephones: I had to make some international calls using the hotel's phone. The program that is charging the calls is rather slow and I was about to leave the hotel without paying some of my calls. Very embarrassing. Make your calls at least a few hours before leaving. The hotel has 2 penthouse apartments that can be a choice for longer stays and also a kind of 2 bedroom family apartments on the first floor. What is special about the latter is their access to the back garden from which the kids can not venture into the street. Interesting option, but I could not see any of them because they were taken. To summarize: is a very good family hotel, very secure and quiet. Room and bathroom very clean, breakfast good, service very good. At least strange, and also with potential danger the socket and the switch into the room. For this reason is a 4 star- (4*-) hotel.", "Date": "March 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle, US & munich, germany", "Title": "\u201cThe perfect Amsterdam hotel!\u201d", "Author": "seattle\u03bcnich", "ReviewID": "UR6841589", "Content": "We called and booked this hotel while on the road, and we were so happy with it!! I had written a few hotels and numbers down after reviewing tripadvisor comments and hotel recommendations. FYI- Hotel Brouwer was another one we liked, but they ONLY take email reservations. Hotel Zandbergen is not directly in the downtown area, but in more of a neighborhood. It is next to all the musuems ('museum district') and has a tram running into town right at the doorstep (maybe 5 min to the dom?). There are cute restaurants on the block and a little grocery store. The hotel: One of the best nights sleep and beds we've had in a hotel! FREE breakfast, and not stale muffins and bad coffee. The owners serve you good coffee/tea, and you have a great little breakfast buffet to choose from. Free internet and computer in the lobby, and plenty of good recommendations and tips by the staff. They have street parking, and are a block away from the technical city limit, so your nights are free. However, we parked in the stadium garage they recommended for 5euros a day, and was perfect for our 3 day stay (just a tram ride away, maybe 10 min). Our room was #4 (105 euros/night + tax) and pictures are attached. You'll see the beds are apart, which isnt the case in all the rooms, but we booked late. My husband and I are used to pushing european singles together though, so it was no big deal. And the best surprise in the world, we had no problems with the 'crack'! Usually one of us is slipping into it or the covers are a pain, but these beds stuck together and was like sleeping on a regular double bed. The frame was pretty heavy and they weren't on rollers. Truly, I was amazed. Since their Saturday was booked, we changed on our last night to the only room available- the penthouse! : ) Was 165 euros + tax, and I've also attached pics. We cant recommend this hotel enough for a great trip to Amsterdam! Enjoy. (Great restaurants we found: Casa Peru, Los Pilones, Soup Enzo-lunch, Oriental City. Am sure you can look them up online for addresses. All have vegetarian and meat lover options!)", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "acstewart25", "ReviewID": "UR6840410", "Content": "Arrived in Amsterdam for a 2 day stay and booked the Hotel a few weeks in advance.

Its about 10 mins on the no.2 tram to the centre and about 18mins to the station. Its just down the road from the van gogh museum and Leidseplein (pubs, comedy club, hard rock cafe, Casino etc). I got a 3 day tram pass from the GVA office directly across from the Central Station for about 13 euros which is very handy. Just stamp it the first time you get on a tram then you just have to flash it to the ticket inspector/driver every time you get on a tram after that. If you've never been before, you're only meant to get onto a tram through some doors (front and second from back) and get off through the others.

As a couple visiting Amsterdam we were bewildered with how many hotel options there are around, especially on this site.

We both have very high standards when it comes to where we choose to stay and believe me the Zandbergen meets and exceeds those high standards. Its in the most beautiful area of Amsterdam, the museum quarter which in itself should be a visitor attraction - but it isn't, making it a peaceful location right next to Vondelpark and 15 mins walk to the centre. The hotel service was great. From the minute you arrive you can see how the owners cherish their hotel and keep it working, clean and friendly from the start of your stay until the very end.
