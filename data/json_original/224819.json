I knew I would pay too much. But I hoped it would be clean and decent. I am a many year member of choice hotels and have earned well over 1,000,000 points. With that said. Tried to check in and staff says. Internet should have not let you book your rooms so cheap. We may not be able to give you those rooms at that price. I'm like what? 300 a night for a normally a 70 dollar a night room. So after 30 min we get room. Get in room. Room is tired, wore out. And needs cleaning bad and paint and rehab. Besides Budweiser has made it one of there hotels and the place is decorated beyond tacky. Also hotel has contract with trucking company. Nothing but lines at the counter at all times. And always maid carts. Even though. It doesn't seem clean. Then. Besides fights in hallways. Prostitutes getting beaten up and cops. Still room still dirty. Hallway dirty.

The room was fairly clean, but outdated, which means it had some old stains and marks on the walls, nothing major but clearly needed some updating. The bathtub leaked water so everytime I showered I had to dry up the pretty much 3/4s of the bathroom floor, and the tap didn't really produce hot water. If you tried to hard to push the faucet to the left to get hot water, water sprayed everywhere. The worst problem for us was the phone system- it was impossible for us to make a call back to Canada. We tried every option on the system, spoke to a couple people at the desk, and there was absolutely no way to make a call, we couldn't even reach an operator, and there are no payphones in the vicinity(are there any payphones anwhere anymore?). But these were really the only issues with the room I had, as well as the soundproofing, we could hear a fair bit from other rooms. Nothing major that would make me avoid the place. The wi-fi, if you're interested in that, is available in the hallways and lobby, but not the rooms for some reason, doesn't bother me but I know other guests were a little put off by it. As for the positives- staff was very friendly and helpful, everyone I talked to at the front desk through the duration of our stay always did their best to help us out. The beds were clean and comfortable, although they had these tiny pillows that were about 1/2 the size of a regular pillow, comfortable enough but you needed 2 of them to sleep on. There was plenty on tv for the rare times we were in the room, the temperature control worked great, and I think the biggest upside to this hotel is the location. It is only a short drive into Indy. There was a waffle house right out front and a convenience store beside it for snacks and other necessities. Overall, the hotel isn't a 5 star or anywhere close, but for a hotel with a great location relative to both the city and the airport, that will get the job done for a couple nights, I would say this hotel would fit the bill.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNot a Bad place, but poorly managed and staffed\u201d", "Author": "JnR2", "ReviewID": "UR122377786", "Content": "We made reservations 1 day in advance (Friday evening, after 7:00pm), for two nights, for Saturday and Sunday. When we arrived Saturday, the desk clerk told us we were listed as a \"no show\", because we were suppose to be there on the previous day and she couldn't tell us whether or not we were charged. We then were told we were quoted the wrong rate and rates were going up the next day. When we gave her our confirmation number she replied \"I can't do anything about that and there is no manager here.\" We were later told we were not charged the \"no-show\" night. She gave us the original rate for one night, but quoted a higher rate for the next night. We stayed only one night, went somewhere else for the second night. When we asked if she could correct the no-show, we were told again \"I can't do that, only a upper manager can correct that.\" The room was OK , a large king, with the small pillows, appeared clean, not a problem. The indoor pool and hot tub were sufficient, however the water had a dirty tint, and the floor was filthy as evidenced by the dirt from our feet when we dried off. Breakfast was biscuits and canned gravy, waffles, and the usual cereal and pastries, orange and apple juice. No fruit, yogurt, or breakfast meats. There is a fee for internet use in the lobby. The motel is located in the airport area, with easy access, parking, 3-story w/elevator. Overall, the facility is average, but we feel the desk clerk was somewhat \"cold\" and had multiple excuses for not being able to correct the no-show error, and the fact she had no authority to correct the rate problem was not acceptable. This would make our second stay at this facility, but we will not stay here again.

I didnt use either one but they look very nice and big.

(might cost extra) . The cleaning lady done a very nice job. I was amazed at the price because the value you get and cleanliness and very nice staff was well worth 52 $ per night. they have vending machines and pop machines, A nice tv in the room w- remote that actually worked, the room had a heater/ ac and it worked very well. Not to mention the little fridge they had in the room was a very good thing to have ,so i didnt even have to use the ice bucket at all.

So, in reference to the review that states there were bed bugs here, I can positively state that was most certainly NOT our finding. (We didn't find a label either. :( ) Rooms include a small refrigerator and a microwave which is unusual for a hotel in this price range. The breakfast buffet is well attended and includes a hot entree, a waffle maker. Hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt and bran cereal are availble for those like me who are trying to make healthier choices. This hotel is set back far from the road, so I don't get the people complaining about road noise, either. We have never had it be a problem And, with the relocation of the Indy airport farther south, the Sam Jones expressway probably is not now getting the traffic it formerly did. You can also park you car here for a small feel. Shuttle service is provided to/from the airport. Beats airport parking rates. Bottom line: I don't think you will be disappointed.

At check in, the clerk was friendly, not super outgoing or extra helpful but it only took about 30 sec for her to ask my name and give me my key. We were on the second floor, close to the elevator. The room was clean, and although not fancy or spectacular it was more then expected. The bedspreads were not super attractive to me (gold damask) but they looked brand new. There were 4 pillows on each bed. The room had a microwave and mini-fridge. Everything seemed well maintained, the only flaw I saw in the room was an area above the shower that had a few spots of peeling paint that could be repainted (I was looking for a flaw to mention or I would not have found/noticed this). The bed was a bit firm for my liking but my husband said it was more comfortable then our bed at home. The pool had a bit too much chlorine but it was very nice. Plenty of towels and chairs and the water was a very nice temperature. I am a cold water baby and usually skip swimming with the kids and husband to sit in the hot tub but the pool here was warm without being so warm it felt like bathwater. The continental breakfast was great. Waffles, cereal, eggs, yougurt, bagels, biscuits and sausage gravy, fresh fruit, 3 types of juice and multiple types of muffins/danishes. Very good value there as it would have cost our family nearly $15-20 to go get coffee, juice and waffles elsewhere for breakfast. I had only 2 complaints- the first one can not hardly be helped when in that close proximity to the airport and major hwy. It was a bit loud at nigh. The fan covered most of the noise but I am a light sleeper and next time I will bring ear plugs if we stay here again. (The rest of the family had no problem with this but if you are a light sleeper too you might want to take it in to consideration) The other is the floor in the bathroom. It is clean and in good condion but instead of tile or a textured linoleum it is a smooth surface. Both of my children slipped and fell even though I had the bathmat down. (the mat obviously doesnt cover the whole floor). Acutally they both slipped and fell twice and I was even in there with them. The surface is just the type with no texture that when even a little bit wet is very slick- not a good choice for a bathroom.
