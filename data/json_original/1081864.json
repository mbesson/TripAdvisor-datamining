It was in my price range, a 4 star hotel, the pictures looked good and it said it was close to the city center reachable by a 20 min bus ride. The reality is, it is about a 45 min bus ride to the main bus station and then from there you can hop on another bus to take you anywhere in the city center in 20 minutes. The hotel itself in my book would be about 2.5 maybe 3 stars, without seeing others to compare. The single room was small, twin bed, the walls needed to be painted, ugly orange blanket and the shades did not work properly. Now, the breakfast they provided (granted it was free) was pitiful. I had the only thing that looked good which was a bowl of corn flakes with warm milk, if you got there quick enough cold milk. There were hard pastries, warm yogurt, a fruit basket, watery scrambled eggs and what looked like a meat soup passing for a bacon product maybe. This hotel is not located in a good place. No resturants near by, only little pastry places where to shop workers maybe spoke a little english. I would not recommend this hotel because after spending 7 days in Rome as a solo traveler the bus got tired, the breakfast sucked and the hotel not in a good spot to go back to your room to put your tired feet up. I did alot, let me tell you alot, of walkig. It would have been nice to go back to your room and put your feet up. Once your back, your back.

To go into the city we used the buses, bus stop is about 200m from hotel, basically a short walk, and the bus ride to main station takes about 15-20 minutes which is pretty good. Bus ticket costs about \u20ac1, pretty good price too. We had a ensuite double room, the bed was 2 singles put together, but we didn't feel the gap at all. The bed was really comfortable, the size of super-king size, which was very spacious. It was quiet. It has air-condition, which is a must-have in Rome. Bathroom is clean, the best thing is the power shower in a good size cubicle, best shower I ever had! We both enjoyed the powerful shower inmensely. Facilities in the room include a safe, which is very handy. A mini fridge. A phone on a desk and a TV that we could only find 1 english channel - BBC world news, but it didn't bothered us so much. What is missing is tea/coffee making facilities. And no slippers were provided. There are night stands with lamps on each side of the bed. Very clean, modern room. The room was made up everyday, though they didn't vacuum the floor during our stay. The complimentary breakfast was limited but decent enough. There were scramble eggs, boil eggs, bacon, ham and salami, yogurt, horrible bread, but 3 different types of croissants, butter and jam, and cereals. Americano coffee and tea were also available. We found out on our last day that you can request the waiter to make proper coffee such as cuppocino and lattes for you :( I would say the breakfast was alright. Now come to the helpfulness of stuff, overall they were friendly and helpful, I had called reception for extra pillows and they were brought up to us. On my last day, I had asked the reception to call my transfer company for confirmation, and it was done for me. The only problem I had was on my first day there, I came down to the reception as I had some questions, to find her chatting away outside on her cellphone for at least 20 minutes even though there were 2 people sitting there who obviously wanted her help. May be she was on her break but there was no other stuff there at that moment. There is also free internet access in the lobby (1pc). I could also use my iphone with the free WIFI in the room, just ask the reception for the password. All in all, it was a very pleasant experience with the hotel.

The claim that the hotel is a 4* is laughable; I would not give them even 3*. First of all, it is FAR! Realistically, it takes about an hour to get from here to anywhere in the center of the city. I usually don\u2019t mind using public transport if it saves me money, but buses in Rome get packed to the gills even on weekends and you will have to make at least one transfer on your way, so using public transportation here is not a good option, especially if you spend the whole day walking around and don't need strain and stress of riding in a packed bus for an hour. It is not feasible to return to the hotel in the afternoon, relax and go out to eat in the evening. Secondly, you can not call out, both internationally and within Italy, even using a calling card! They blocked phone lines, and I was not able to get an explanation as to why. This is unacceptable, and is a failure to provide a basic service. Also, midway through my stay something happened and I could not get connected even with the front desk, and had to come downstairs whenever I needed something. Third, you can not set a thermostat to your liking. The default setting was full blast heating for some reason, and I had to sleep with open windows, which let in mosquitoes. Also, sound insulation is insufficient, and I was getting woken up by people walking in the hallway. Fourth, the room and bed are tiny. Sheets are well worn and have holes. They give only one towel, but it is changed daily and was nice and clean. The shower is OK, also. However, they do not provide shampoo. Some rooms are even tinier than the one that I got! Fifth, the rooms are not clean. There is a lot of dust, and they don\u2019t get vacuumed regularly. Also, the hotel is very far from the airport. You will have to pay E65-70 to get there.

If you jump on the 84 bus, you can get very close to the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum, or the Piazza Venezia. Buses are very cheap too - \u20ac1.00 for a single trip, but we opted for a 7-day unlimited bus pass which cost just \u20ac16.00, particularly handy as tickets cannot be bought on the bus! The room was very comfortable, and whilst not huge there was plenty of space for the two of us. Had it not been for the air conditioning in the room, I don't think either of us would have survived the trip! It was WONDERFULLY cold in the room - we came back to the Hotel most days during the hottest part to cool down and take a rest. The service we received cannot be faulted in any way. All the staff were friendly and smiling, all spoke English (a great relief to us both!) and were always very happy to help. When the cleaning service forgot to leave us bath towels, fresh ones appeared within minutes of asking, despite the fact the cleaners had long since left! When it comes to the morning, breakfast was served between 7 and 11, and consisted of a large range of continental pastries, meats, cheese, cereals, yoghurts and fruit. For those that wanted it, bacon and eggs were also on offer. Let's also not forget to mention the coffee, which although great in the hotel, was fantastic wherever you went. And very cheap! Near the hotel are plenty of pasticcieria, supermarkets and bars, and a few restaurants just up the road which were recommended by reception staff - La Taverna dei Brigante is well worth a visit - just arrive with a large appetite!

The other problem is that if you plan on staying out after midnight you have to find another form of transportation to get back to the hotel as the Metro stops at midnight but there are night buses just they are a little trickier to figure out and don't run all the frequently. The breakfast was great, not a lot of stuff but tasty, scrambled eggs, bacon, yogurt, fruit, cereal, toast and such. They did have free internet which is always a plus.

She had been studying abroad in Spain, so we met up with her at the end of the trip and visited Rome and Paris. We were on a budget and the price of Hotel Aniene was very reasonable compared to stories I had heard and prices I had seen. I guess that's why it is so far away from the ancient ruins, the Vatican, etc. The morning breakfasts which were included in our price were adequate. The bathroom was large but lacked any counter space, towel racks, or hooks. (Maybe this is a European thing. The same was true in Seville.) Bring your own washcloths as no one knows what they are. The only room for 3 was room 501. When we got to the hotel at 10:30 pm, a hotel staff member took us up to our room. To our amazement, we went up to the 5th floor on the elevator, got off, had to walk onto the roof to the door of our room. There was no working light, and we could not see where to insert a key card. The staff member opened the door for us. We asked about replacing the light the first 2 days we were there and were told it would be done the following week. That did not help us at all. As luck would have it, the temps got into the 90's in Rome the 5 days we were there. I got a horrible migraine from it. I could hardly wait to get back to the hotel the first day so I could relax in an air-conditioned room. Too bad. The A/C was not working, and did not work for 3 days, all in stifling heat. A fan was provided, but my headache did not improve inspite of taking my meds. We did a practice run from our hotel to the Vatican the day before our actual 10:00 am tour. It took 90 minutes to get from the hotel by bus to the Vatican museum. We allotted 2 hours 30 minutes the next morning. We asked for a discount because of the lack of A/C and the missing light.

The room was clean and it had the basics. The only channels in English were the MTV and BBC news. Very basic breakfast and we didn\u2019t find any menu of what we could have ordered e.g. if you ask them, they can make you fresh orange juice or a toast. We didn\u2019t find it out until the last day we left! There is wireless internet (you have to ask at the reception for a code) and PC with internet access at the reception, \u20ac3 for 15 mins. The walls are very thin and if you have noisy neighbours, you might suffer. There isn\u2019t a mirror in the main room e.g. if you want to blow dry your hair. Also if you want to blow dry your hair in the bathroom, you have to use the hotel\u2019s blow dryer because there isn\u2019t a proper socket there. Also, there isn\u2019t any shelf that you could put your stuff e.g. your toothbrush. I enjoyed the pressure of the water in the shower and the temperature of the room (it was quite warm). Also the beds were very comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful although they didn\u2019t know basic things e.g. we asked for restaurants around the hotel\u2019s area and they gave us only one which is 100 meters from there (you will pass in front of it in order to go to the hotel-you can\u2019t miss it). We ate one night at this restaurant and the food was okay, nothing exciting. The area is very quiet and it has very few shops. This can be an issue if you want to buy something from a supermarket or pharmacy. Although we didn\u2019t have any problem, we didn\u2019t feel very safe in that neighbourhood after 10 o\u2019clock (two females, early thirties). Buses: Yes, there are buses to the city centre but it takes at least 20 mins to get there and you have to wait for another 15 mins for the bus to come. So, each journey takes an average 30-45mins. When we read the other travellers\u2019 reviews, we thought that this would be okay. However, we found out that this was the bigger issue of all. Rome is quite big with lots of attractions. If you want to spend a few hours in the centre in the morning, have lunch, then go to hotel to have a shower/relax and go out again for the afternoon/evening, this means that you have to commute for at least 2.5-3 hrs per day. We were exhausted doing that after the second day and we preferred to spend the whole day in the centre and have early nights. I assume that if you are going to spend a week in Rome or you are willing to take taxis, that might be okay. We had only five days and we wanted to see as much as possible. Taxis charge around \u20ac30-\u20ac40 from the hotel to Termini. We bought Rome Pass for 3 days. This is a good value for money if you commute to hotel twice a day. Otherwise, the cost is almost the same as the bus ticket is only \u20ac1. Rome Pass gives you free access to the first two monuments and half price to the rest of them. However, you will find out that it is hard to visit more than one per day due to the queues and lack of time. Regarding your luggage, you can leave at Termini. They charge \u20ac4 for 5 hrs. Again, that\u2019s a good idea if you want to visit a place the last day and you don\u2019t want to spend your time commuting between the hotel and the Termini. We were in Rome at Easter and we had an excellent time. The city is beautiful and there are so many places to explore. Make sure that you have a good street map and ask policemen for directions if you are lost (most of them speak English and are quite helpful). The hotel didn\u2019t have to provide us with a map but they told us that they had placed an order. So, you could ask the receptionist for a map of the area. Overall, we would have preferred to have spend some extra money and have stayed a little bit closer to the city centre. It would have made our lives easier.

You are certainly living with the locals in the surrounding area and there isn't a big lot to do locally. The neighbourhood felt safe though it isn't the poshest.

If we were staying 1/2 nights we might consider the city centre but would definitely stay here again for any longer stay.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "MsCharners", "ReviewID": "UR19965272", "Content": "I have just come back from a weeks stay with my mum and brother at the Hotel Aniene. Though the room was quite small and simple it was uncluttered and very clean and given that we stayed in a triple room it is understandable that there was not much room in the main sleeping area for anything else other than the beds, bedside tables and dressing table. The only thing that was missing from the room was a full lenth mirror though there was a wall mirror in the bathroom. The rooms were cleaned every day, the bed linen was changed, and the toiletries and the towels were replaced. The only complaint here (if you can call it a complaint) is that this was done even when we left a \"do not disturb sign\" on the door when we went out. The breakfast buffet choice was more than sufficient for us consisting of a choice of two cereals, yogurts, fruit, cakes, croissants, bread with jams and cheese, ham, bacon, scrambled egg and a selection of teas and juices as well as coffee. The front of house staff were very friendly and efficient and were willing to help out whenever required for example booking our excursion, booking us a taxi to the airport. The only issue that we had was that it was further from the city than we expected and you definitely need to either catch a bus or get a taxi in order to reach the city centre. The buses however were very cheap (just one euro per trip or four euros for a day ticket). Overall a vey pleasant stay, just would have been nicer if it had been closer to the city centre.", "Date": "September 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cThe bus ride is worthwhile.\u201d", "Author": "shangyung", "ReviewID": "UR19955903", "Content": "I stayed at Hotel Aniene for two nights in late August.
