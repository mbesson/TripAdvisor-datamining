Hence, I know it by experience, that finding an affordable hotel in Bur Dubai where one can stay with parents could be a bit tricky if you know what i mean. Its a hotel apartment, which means that its best suited for long stays. And I have stayed for around 90 days altogether in this hotel over a period of time. Apparently, the management is from Pakistan. Hence, the food at the restaurant is mostly Pakistani cuisine. And what Yummm!!! food they serve. I just love the biryani there. The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms clean. Unlike most of the hotel apartments in Dubai (in this price range), the rooms are cleaned daily. In most of the other hotel apartments, the rooms are cleaned at max thrice a week. The location is superb. Its right on the bank street (upmarket heart of Bur Dubai), opposite Bur Juman Mall, and right next to the Metro Station. Taxis are available 24x7. Since its a mix of commercial and residential hub, most of the amenities are at stone's throw distance away. Overall, a nice, elegant, economical, family hotel. The staff is courteous. Room service is just about ok. I do not really understand one thing about most of the hotels in Dubai - their fascination with darkness, or rather lack of light. There are hardly any lights in the rooms of most of the hotels. If one is planning to read a book, its a killer.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cexcellent value in hot & pricey Dubai\u201d", "Author": "ked999", "ReviewID": "UR124280545", "Content": "great studio apartment 70USD on wotif.com (time of year).

In three words: \u201cAdequate, but dated\u201d. But yes, I would stay here again. The reasons I booked this room is as a one-night stayover on my way to Bangkok; I wanted a place that was by the Metro, and affordable. The place delivered with both of these qualities. After basking the blue light of the Khalid Bin Al-Waleed metro station, and surfacing from Exit 4, you see the hotel almost right away. At the time I was there, I needed to cross a sandy, vacant lot. The lobby was quaint, but empty. It did not seem like the type of hotel you would spend time in the lobby, just hanging out. That said though, it was very quiet. Check in was quick and efficient, took less than five minutes. The rooms were quite large, and in the pictures I have, looks sumptuous. Once you get in closer though, you can see the furniture and other fixtures are quite old. There is a kitchenette in the place too. I found some food on one of the \u201cunused\u201d cups though. Also, there was some mildew in the bathroom. The TV was tiny, probably 45 cm or so, and a tube TV, not a flat screen. I didn\u2019t know there were any tube TVs out there anymore. This place just needs a makeover. Bottom line: If you are looking for a place to lay your head, and don\u2019t plan on spending much time in the room, this is a great place. The proximity to the metro station is a big plus. Tip: There is a coffee shop (Picardo Caf\u00e9) immediately across the street from the hotel that you can get free wi-fi. The hotel charges for it. Also, there is a place called \u201cClub 7\u201d nearby that had some decent nightlife. Luke Mejares was there the night I showed up.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muscat, Masqat, Oman", "Title": "\u201cDubai experience\u201d", "Author": "NitinGujarathi", "ReviewID": "UR120517259", "Content": "Very good service, good food .
