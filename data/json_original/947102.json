They were repairing the hotel so this means we couldn't get rest for a short while because of the noise from outside and at the same time inside! Secondly, the bathrooms were awful! Very dirty, old and cold.. I dont know how to explain it but just imagine the worst bathroom you have ever seen. In our first room which is located on the 2. floor, we couldnt take a shower because of scum and cold. I also want to be fair about staff. They tried to help us after hearing our complaints but the problem was that: if we could change room after telling them - so this means they had some other better rooms- why did they give us the worst room in the first step??? I found this behaviour a bit tricky! Breakfasts were all right but not spectacular. So , to sum up, I don't recommend this hotel to anyone . You can easily find nicer hotels in Taksim with the same price. (about 50 Euros for a night.)

Hotels on this side are more expensive as they were business oriented. We choose this hotel because it was close to the local night life district of Beyoglu and near the major shopping street of Istiklal Avenue. The area is modern Turkey local in flavour and not very touristy which was what we were looking. Our hotel was a 5 minute walk away from this action across a major road which we had chosen because we were afraid of late night noise from revelers. The first thing we noticed was our room was very smoky. We were told that there was only 1 non smoking room per floor and they were full. Since it was our first night in Turkey, and noticing the much greater prevalence of smoking, we assumed this would be the norm. On our later travels in Turkey in similar quality hotels, we didn't find this problem. The hotel is newish like the photos on the website. It's location is ideal for Istiklal avenue although you have to cross a very busy road but there is a pedestrian intersection. Unfortunately traffic noise is loud as it's by this busy road. Access to the old town is easy as buses run down this road towards the old town. Breakfast was adequate. Typical Turkish choices with some cheese, breads and local cold cuts. Free Wifi is available but partially because the building is concrete, and secondly cause it's 7 stories tall, reception is good only on the first few floors. I surfed with my laptop in the lobby. Staff was helpful and friendly. Cleaning done was adequate. Rooms were mainly new except we noticed peeling paint on the ceilings. Floors looked like new hardwood veneer. In all it was adequate accommodation for the upgraded backpacking style of travel we were doing, except for the really smoky rooms.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Santa Pera Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d947102-Reviews-Santa_Pera_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$64 - $131*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">TepebasI Refik Saydam Cad.
