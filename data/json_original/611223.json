I have been to 4 stars in Cuba that were worse. I enjoyed the staff because I was polite to them and they returned my politeness. You cannot be better situated in Istanbul. Why pay more for a clean bed and decent breakfast unless you want to go all out and spend the money on a 5 Star + or better?", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Otago", "Title": "\u201cGood location, disappointing service\u201d", "Author": "wanaka_kiwi", "ReviewID": "UR34661795", "Content": "We were disappointed in this hotel as the service, attitude of staff and quality of rooms did not live up to 4 star rating or advertising material. We asked for a double room, but they only have rooms with twin single beds, when I asked at reception for a double they said I could push the singles together. Obviously guests smoke in the rooms as the airconditioning unit constantly smelled of stale smoke. The shower in our bathroom leaked and flooded the floor everytime we had a shower, we reported this to reception but nothing was done. The shower taps and mixer are hanging off the wall (maybe this is why it leaks). There were dirty dishes left in the hallway across from our room for the duration of our stay - 3 nights. I asked the reception where the ala carte restaurant shown in the brochure was and he said it was closed, when asked why he rudely said they didnt have one any more and couldnt recommend a restaurant anywhere else.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201crude staff be warned\u201d", "Author": "khanom6", "ReviewID": "UR10314169", "Content": "i stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and it was totally rubbish i went with my hubby and my 3 year old daughter. the first night i asked for extra pillows but after waiting for an hour i had to go down 3 times then finally the pillows came. the following morning i asked for a iron as all my clothes had creased in the suitcase. i was first told to wait then a few hours later i went down and spoke to the duty manager. she told me that they are unable to provide a iron. i was wondering why i was told the first time i could have a iron then told i cant. the hotel itself is definately not a 4star. the rooms are the size of a sardine can.thehotel failed its description on the website there was no minibar no hair dryer. last night i came into my room to find a cockroach on the wall. i informed the duty manager and requested to change the room. he told me that all rooms were full therefore we couldnt change ours. i also realised that the whole four days we stayed they did not change the bed sheets. they just came in and made the beds and left fresh towels. the only thing good about this hotel was the bellboy and the staff in the restaurant upstairs. the duty manager was a small chubby blonde turkish woman. she was very rude and arrogant. could definately do with learning a few things about customer service and going easy on the attitude. pls anyone reading this message avoid this hotel. staying at this hotel made me get a bit frustrated and annoyed, with lead to argueing with my hubby.", "Date": "October 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "France", "Title": "\u201cNice location, correct but not outstanding hotel\u201d", "Author": "stan1668", "ReviewID": "UR5934008", "Content": "Nice location, interior of the hotel looks nice, too.

Our room came with a shower cubicle but the whole bathroom was much bigger than the Allstar Golden Crown Hotel, so it made showering much easier FACILITIES -- They have a hammam and a gym but you must pay Euro 10 for it. -- They have massage for Euro 20 as well. I didn't think it was worth it so i didn't try PRICE -- booked it on gtahotels for Euro 50 BREAKFAST -- On the top floor, with a nice view of the sea. -- The spread was average with fried eggplant, some weird fried vegetable with cornflour, boiled eggs (common in Turkey) and cut sausages with tomato sauce. They also have bread and some salad. LOCATION -- It is within walking distance to the Grand Bazaar -- Sultanahmet is a tram ride away (2 stops i think).
