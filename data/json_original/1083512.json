{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Value Hotel for Tokyo I have stayed at Shinjuku Vintage many times since 2000 with the last stay in October 2006. Not much has changed over the years. Hotel still looks the same and the condition has been maintained the same, so looks exactly the same as it did in 2000! Clean and tidy,Only change to the hotel which I have welcomed is broadband access now available in all rooms free of charge. You just ask at reception for the cables which come in a small clear plasic case, that's Japanese packaging for you! When you leave, you just leave it in the room, no need to remove it and take it back to reception on check out.Yes, the rooms are small but do remember this is Tokyo with some of highest real estate prices in the World. I have stayed in other hotels in Tokyo with larger rooms but also with corresponding larger hotel bills. Walking through the Kabukicho (red light district) to get to the hotel can be a bit intimidating at first but you soon become accustomed to it. There is no problem with personal security at all. Loads of cheap 24hr eateries (yoshinoya, matsoya etc)within 10 mins walk if jetlag has got the better of you.As to not having a local shop, I am not sure how well the other reviewer looked around.... if you turn left out of the hotel, there is a 24hr supermarket less than 50metres away!Overall I can recommend this hotel to anyone who just needs a clean and convenient place to stay in Tokyo. Being located in Shinjuku, 10 mins walk from JR station, it is a great place to base your holiday in Tokyo as Shinjuku Station has connections to everywhere in Tokyo and beyond.You pay for what you get and based on this you cannot go wrong.", "Date": "May 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR737372670", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ayct"}, {"Content": "If you are not claustrophobic This is a popular business hotel with the Japanese and tourists from SE Asia. The hotel is north of the red light district (Kabuki Cho) in a semi-residential setting. Which poses some problems:You always have to go through the red light district. It is by no means unsafe or too intimidating, however. There is no shop within 5-10 minutes walking distance, and you might have to wait for a while if you want to hail a cab.The main concern though is the size of the rooms. They are extremely small. For the double room we were in, the bed is right against 2 walls, with about 1 foot of empty space on the foot end, and about 2 feet on the open side, which also accommodates a desk and chair :) If you have some full-size suitcases, I am not sure where you can put them. The bathroom is not too small by Japanese standard, as it is modular.Finally, the in-room temperature was not adjustible and we were being cooked, because it's winter time.If you get a good rate and don't spend anytime in the room except to sleep, it's OK.P.S. I hope you are an earlier bird because the tourists got rowdy getting up in the morning.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR714666477", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bibimbob"}, {"Content": "\u93c2\u677f\ue196\u9287\ue1bb\u8151\u9287\u0446\u60e4\u9287\uff04\u6f43\u9287\u6219\u5020   showReview(20366581, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR188520132", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "toshiaki"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d1083512-r7627837-Hotel_Vintage_Shinjuku-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1083512", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
