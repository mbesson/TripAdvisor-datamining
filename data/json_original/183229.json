If you are looking for a 4 or 5 star hotel and spa move on this is not what you want and you will not be happy. If you want a nice apartment to stay in this is the place for you. I would highly recommend renting a 1 bedroom as they are much nicer than the studios. I used to travel for work and I dislike the traditional room with bed. (including 5 star) You can go to the PA Market(1418 Du Fort) or IGA (in the Mall) and pick up a few groceries. (A soda tastes much better at 50 cents a can than $4.00 out of a mini-fridge) The hotel is centrally located just off busy St. Catherine. The Atwater Metro and AMC22 (AMC theaters) and Place Alexis Nihon (Mall) are all about about a 3 minute walk away. If you have a problem please let the staff know and as far as my experiences any problem will be resolved to the best of their abillities. The rooms that have been renovated are nice. When booking if possible ask for a renovated room. The rooms not yet renovated are a little worn but still nice. The only complaint I have is that the pool is very small though they do have an outside sunning area. For the price it's a bargin.

I didn't heed that advice this time around. I had to make a 3 night booking for Downtown Montreal for some meetings, and felt I was getting such a good price for a suite hotel in that city, that I grabbed it from booking.com. I just couldn't pass it up. My mistake. I arrived at the hotel at about 9pm. There is no immediate place to park the car, as the streets are all full. So I called the front desk, and they informed me that the hotel parking lot was full, and I would have to park at the Pepsi Forum across the street. Ok, I'll let that one slip. When I finally get to the hotel, I get the sense that this is some old age pensioner's place, or something from Vancouver's downtown east side for the homeless. The check-in staff were friendly enough--gave me a room and sent me on my way. The building inside and outside looks like it's from the 70s. The relic of an elevator took 5 mins to respond to the call button, despite being empty. As soon as I approached the door to the room, I could smell something nasty. I opened the door and was floored. The place stunk--reeked--of I don't know what. It was pervasive throughout the entire living room, kitchen, bedroom and toilet. I opened all the doors and windows and turned the a/c to full and went outside to have dinner. An hour later I returned to find absolutely no change. I went to the front desk, told them of the situation and they gave me another room on a lower floor. Hesitantly, I opened the door and was pleased to find no smell. However the room was identical to the previous one. Let me just say this, not once did I walk barefoot in that room, not even with socks on--I kept my shoes on the entire time. The carpet was filthy. On one area under the bed, there appeared to be a large glob of what looked like rat feces. There was dust everywhere. All the furnishings are about 30 years old or older, and they looked like it. I didn't dare sit on the couch in the living room, it was covered with a fine layer of dirt. I went on the balcony and immediately came inside again--it was horrendous. Paint peeling off everywhere, cigarette butts on the ground, big dark bltoches all over the place. In the room, there were enormous stains all over the walls and the carpets and sofa. The kitchen was a joke. All though there was a fridge and a stove and some basic accessories, I didn't dare use anything. The bathroom was tiny, but it was clean i'll give it that much. But it looked like it belonged in a urban Detroit 2 bedroom home slated for demolition. You can imagine the beds weren't much better. As soon as I lifted the mattress, I could see the bed bugs with my own eyes everywhere. I stayed one night, and despite having prepaid for three, left the next day and checked into the Holiday Inn Express--same price but a world apart. Let me say this--I travel all over the world, stay about 100 nights a year in hotels. I stay at major properties like Fairmont, Intercontinentals, etc, and smaller dives in places like Delhi and Bangkok. I am definitely not a very picky person. I can appreciate some properties are simply older, but are well kept. I can appreciate some properties are simply cheaper or budget. But this place should not exist as a hotel. It should have been demolished 10 years ago. I know extreme reviews are usually not reliable, but take it from me--avoid this place at all costs.

La Tour Belvedere's description (and photos) on reservations.lodging.com is very deceptive: \"The La Tour Belvedere is newly renovated with spacious furnished suites and fully equipped kitchens.\" If this flophouse has been \"newly renovated\" then I shudder to think about what it looked life BEFORE they renovated it. When we arrived we received no assistance with our luggage. The concierge (who was also the reservation clerk, bookkeeper, housekeeper, bellboy, hotel detective and switchboard operator) offered us no assitance with our luggage; not even the use of a wagon. \"Da elevator's over dere. Here's ya key!\" This guy also made several errors with our reservations during the weeks leading to our arrival. The \"two bedroom\" suite we were promised turned out to be a tiny room with 2 \"beds\": one bed was actually a convertible couch. The other a murphy bed that we had to pull out of the wall. When we pulled down the Murpht bed (no assistance offered by the Belvedere staff) we were horrified to discover that they hadn't even made the bed from the previous guest. The bed was difficult to pull down and had sharp metal edges that we kept cutting our feet on. There was a dim, flourescent light over the bed giving it that eerie, brothel look. We had top make our own bed with sheets that were scratchy and did not smell clean. There was no shampoo in the bathroom. On a positive note, the kitchen was large and serviceable. \"The property is in a superb downtown location in a place of quiet, in the heart of Montreal's vibrant pleasure and business scene.\" Yes, it should be \"quiet\" since it is a good 30 minute walk (or 8 - 10 minute taxi ride) from anything. In fact, though, it was pretty noisy outside since it is in the middle of combination lower-middle class residental / small business (not shops) area. People were outside yelling after coming home from night shifts or an evening of drinking at local (non-tourist) hangouts. When I tried to call my own room from the airport to see if my girlfriend had arrived yet, the concierge/switchboard operator/reservation clerk tried to connect me. When there was no answer, I hung up. When my girlfriend called down to the hotel office later, to ask if there were any messages, she was told \"yeah, your boyfriend called and said he will be here in 15 minutes.\" I left no such message. In fact I left no message. Since I had not even gotten on my plane to leave for Montreal, it would be hours before I arrived. After an hour passed and I still hadn't arrived, she called the hotel desk again, the concierge/hotel detective/housekeeper said \"maybe something happened to him.\" My girlfriend was distraught !! She thought I died in a taxicab accident. We moved out this hole-in-the-wall the next morning, but they insisted on charging us for 2 days since we were checking out early. We checked into a Days Inn right in the middle of downtown for $22CAD a night less (and got full American breakfast and a swimming pool thrown in). The Days Inn room was almost twice the size, had daily room service, and all the amenities. WHAT WERE WE THINKING when we selected La Tour Belvedere ?!?!?!?", "Date": "February 18, 2002"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Tour Belvedere", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d183229-Reviews-La_Tour_Belvedere-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$77 - $181*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2175 boulevard de Maisonneuve Ouest</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H3H 1L5</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "183229", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/dd/ca/da/facade.jpg"}}
