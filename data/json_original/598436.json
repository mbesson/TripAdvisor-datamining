This hotel is clean and spacious and very comfortable with. We have stayed there 6 times or more and have yet to stay in a room that wasn't very comfortable! The amenities are wonderful, and the breakfast is GREAT, can't beat biscuits and gravy! The location is GREAT. It is not on the strip so it is easy to get into and out of, but it is close to everything in Branson! But what makes the Rosebud such a great place is the people. The staff and management are 2nd to none! The last 2 years I have brought a group of our Senior Citizens from church to Branson for a conference and we have stayed at the Rosebud and the staff has just been GREAT to work with, the managers have been so very helpful in getting rooms reserved and when I come to check in, they have everything ready to go and they go above and beyond the call of duty to make us feel at home away from home!

Continental breakfast, tea and coffee in the mornings was most enjoyable. We needed a bit of flexibility with our check out times and since it was possible, management was very willing to help. Now, about the management....some of the friendliest people I've met (and I've met many). Courteous, professional, and warm. They did go out of their way to help make our event as smooth as possible.
