The one tiny lift which could only hold 2 people or one with luggage, is shabby and the carpet in it is worn into holes. On the 4th floor there is graffiti on the wall outside the lift door. The \"continental\" breakfast which is served in a little room in the basement, consists of corn flakes, bran flakes, sliced white bread for toasting, butter, jams, tea bags, instant coffee, milk and orange juice.
