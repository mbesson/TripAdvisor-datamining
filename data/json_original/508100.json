I thought the rate of 109.00 a night was a bit high, being mid-week and on the outskirts of New Orleans. But we were weary from traveling and didn't want to traverse the city at such a late hour. I even inquired if there was a coupon I might be able to find and was told no. I found out later there was one for 79.00 a night and they had rooms available at that rate!! The room was kind of smallish, especially for a King room, but I loved the bed. It was very comfortable, not hard and actually had a down comforter with a beautiful coverlet. The room was very clean and new looking. The bathroom was large, but was missing many of the basic complimentary toiletries that Holiday Inn always supplies. I was too tired to complain. The next morning, I went to the continental breakfast and it was kind of paltry. It was 8:30 and already what little they had offered was gone, with still an hour to go. The lady who takes care of the continental breakfast saw me scruitinzing the leftovers and did bring out some fresh items. She was very friendly. I did appreciate the fact they had an actual computer you could use to get online in the lobby. Although they have wireless in the rooms, not everyone has a laptop.", "Date": "Apr 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR752817459", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mayberryrfd"}, {"Content": "bad experience We signed up to receive a free two-night stay with Fairfield in exchange for doing a tour/sales presentation in New Orleans. We have done this before, and it is usually just fine. This time, we were treated terribly rudely, thrown out before the presentation, and then charged for our hotel room. We had attempted to tell the representative that we didn't want to buy that day, and that we would appreciate his going as quickly as possible through the presentation. He became angry and wouldn't recover. He was insulting and then he finally tossed us out. We have written to the CEO of Fairfield and hope for something better. I'd avoid the Fairfield New Orleans at all costs.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR940554646", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d508100-r23234682-Holiday_Inn_Express_New_Orleans_East-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "HotelID": "508100", "Price": "$123"}}
