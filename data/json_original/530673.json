Our room came with a King sized bed, coffee maker, microwave, and mini-fridge. The La Quinta was also close to several nice eateries and some local shopping. I cant speak for anyone else but....our room was clean and fairly modern looking. The gentleman at the front desk did a fantastic job with hospitality. We did not utilize it, but there was also an indoor pool. For the services and value that we recieved for the price, I would recommend this to travelers who want a decent room and value for their money. I too..would stay here again. Good luck with your travels.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here!\u201d", "Author": "HCS48", "ReviewID": "UR116117077", "Content": "We stayed the weekend of the Brickyard 2011. We finally settled into our 3rd room, the first had an air conditioner leak, the second the air conditioner did not work right and the third worked but there was no frig or microwave but we were tired of moving by then. There were BB or bullet holes in our window. There was screaming and doors slamming throughout the night. The breakfast had a lot to be desired and that was when there was breakfast. Sunday morning they ran out of almost everything. We will not be staying there again if we visit Indy. The one good thing that made it bearable was the staff was accommodating.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria", "Title": "\u201cNothing extraordinary\u201d", "Author": "ExpertComptable", "ReviewID": "UR115615161", "Content": "Convenient and relatively inexpensive.

The only one we wouldn't recommend is the one on Rt. 70 in Albequerque....hair in bathtub, bad pillows, old facility. The La Quinta suites in Flagstaff was really nice...although the complimentary breakfast was not so good in any of the facilities.
