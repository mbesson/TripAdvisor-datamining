As a platinum member of the Intercontinental group of hotels I stay in Crowne Plaza's on a regular basis and this particular hotel certainly didn't seem up to scratch.\u00a0 For starters it is very dated and shabby, which is odd seen as it apparently only opened a year ago. It even has an 'old' smell. Parts of the hotel are currently being renovated but in my opinion it will take a few years of renovation to put it on par with other CPs. I would honestly question a 4* rating never mind 5*.\u00a0 The rooms are of a decent size (and I received an upgrade as per platinum member standard) but they are more B&B style than hotel. Although I will say that the bed was very comfortable.\u00a0 The pool area is nice though I doubt large enough in peak season. It's also fairly noisy as is by a busy road and is very close to the airport.\u00a0 The food buffet was over-priced and only just average. Although to be fair I'm very picky at buffets so it's not fair for me to judge this solely by myself. My partners generally enjoyed the food but commented we'd had better elsewhere in Dubai. Another thing to note is that the tourist information point within the hotel (to arrange trips) only accepts cash, which was a particular problem for me as I tend to take little cash on business (or holidays) trips preferring to use a credit card that doesn't charge for foreign transactions. Unfortunately the lady trying to book my partner and I on a desert safari didn't tell us this until she had filled all our details out, and then got very frustrated with us when we didn't have cash to pay with. Apparently 'putting it on the room' wasn't an option, but we could go take out cash from a cash machine in a nearby mall. However she couldn't appreciate that we didn't want to do this for two reasons, 1) we would be charged through the roof for taking out cash, 2) it was too much hassle, considering that we had just wanted to 'book and go'. She then started demanding our signatures on the booking form, for 'if we changed our mind later', and couldn't understand why were not happy to do so unless we were going through with the full transaction. Anyway we said we'd arrange something elsewhere and left. However the worst part was that the lady rang again when we got back to our room trying to change our minds, and then proceeded to wake us up with early morning phone calls for the next two days (checking that we hadn't changed our minds).\u00a0 They also have a problem with their Wi-Fi in the club lounge, which seems to kick you off if more than two people are connected. To be fair to the hotel they sent a technician to try and help, but he seemed to know very little about IP addresses, routers and everything else we explained to him, so we gave it up as a bad job.\u00a0 In addition to all of the above they are currently running a competition to win a trip to Europe (owing to it being their one year anniversary) for which you receive free entry for each 100 dirhams you spend in the hotel bars/restaurants. I should have received 3 entries but received nothing. I questioned this as I checked out and they just shrugged and said 'oh you should have received them when you paid, maybe you can collect them when the restaurant opens'. I'm checking out because I have a flight to catch, I'm hardly going to be hanging around waiting for them to open their doors. Very poor. This is definitely a business hotel and not one to use for a holiday (I also don't recommend Deira in general for holidays, you should opt for a resort in the newer part of Dubai near The Palm etc). \u00a0It is convenient for the airport (not that that really matters when taxis are so cheap)\u00a0but I can't really say its good for anything else. Personally I wouldn't even return for a one night business stay even though I'm a member of the chain and collect points for stays.

Booked a standard room but as a platinum priority club member I was given access to the club lounge. We arrived to the hotel quite late by taxi, which was about 15-20 minute due to heavy traffic. Please note that reception is up the esclators on the 1st floor! After a 8 hour flight, I didnt notice the size which told me this!! Check was quick and without any hassle. I was greeted by name and my platinum status was acknowledged. When I got to the room, I was very impressed to find a personal welcome letter with a fruit platter. The room itself was adequate but did feel the decore was a bit \"boring\", I didnt feel I was on holiday in the UAE. However the room had everything you would need, safe, ironing board, hairdryer, etc. Room service was excellent. The room was always cleaned brilliantly. Also the room service guys were always smiley and polite in the corridors! The club lounge was very good. What made it was the staff, these guys deserve a pay rise! Once you told them your room number, they would acknowledge your name and remember everytime you visited! Excellent service!! Breakfast was good but obviously limited, the hot dishes changed everyday. Again during the evening the food was of a very good quality, with a very good selection of drinks. The lounge itself was open during the day, which was nice to pop in for a quick drink. The lounge also hosted a computer with free internet and printer, which came in very useful when checking in online for my return flight. Location was very good. It was my first time in Deira. It is quite a residental area but is very close to a small mall (with a few supermarkets if required). Also the hotel is about a 5-10 minute walk away from the Al Saladin metro station, which came in very useful when going out in the evenings and going to the airport. I was really impressed with the health centre facilities. It looked like they had been recently renovated. The gym was excelelnt and had all the machines/weights you would need, and the sauna was nice and relaxing. The outside pool was nice, but think the jacuzzi was broken, quite a few jets werent working. Again the staff were fantasic, on the first day, one of the attendants Wilot (I think thats how you spelt his name) showed me all the facilities the health centre had to offer. The only negatives was actually the conceige desk. I asked for a metro map on the second day, but he didnt have one. Another day I asked for a taxi to the Festival shopping mall, I was advised that the private taxis outside cost the same as the city taxis (40Dhs). However on the way back in the evening it only cost me 20Dhs! So be warned the taxis waiting outside may overcharge you! Quite enjoyed my stay, would definately consider it when I return to Dubai.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cGood Location and Excellent Service\u201d", "Author": "HaniMustafa", "ReviewID": "UR123647522", "Content": "I attended a conference in Dubai, and this hotel was booked for me.

I assume this to be a gesture for elites to get to know the hotel better. I am sure this policy will change after the rooms are redone but until then it is a great perk. I had originally planned to stay the Crowne Plaza Festival City on points but given that I got a rate of less than 400AED per night here and a club floor upgrade, this changed my mind. Arrival: We arrived on a Friday night at about 9PM and after a quick ten minute taxi ride from the airport we were greeted by an energetic bell staff and after they took our bags we were shown the way to check in the lobby at the top of the escalators. I was worried that the taxi driver would not be familiar with the hotel since it had change over from another property change lately but that was not a problem at all. Check-In: Check-in was just as pleasant as the arrival down stairs. I was informed that we were upgraded to a club floor and explained the benefits and I was then told that as a Platinum member that I would get free internet. Now, I am not sure that internet is a benefit of being Plat but possibly a Club floor benefit. At any rate it was MUCH appreciated as it saves me some money as I need to do work when I am traveling and have to have internet. It is a must. I would clarify with the hotel before expecting free internet as Priority Club Platinum member as it may well just be a benefit of the club floor which is more typical. The Room: The room is dated but\u2026\u2026it is very clean and well maintained. It is good size and the bed has a feather bed topper that makes it very comfy. Now, if you are one of those folks that like sleeping on a rock then you may want to see about having it removed during you stay but we liked it and slept very well. There were plenty of TV channels in various languages and also a good sized LCD TV. There were two chairs in the room and I prefer a chair and an ottoman. There are no real views to speak of but you will get a good view of the planes departing/arriving as you are in the flight path but I did not hear any flight noise during hour stay so the rooms are well insulated. The bathroom was good sized and had a bidet if that is important to you and plenty of toiletries and the only complaint is lack of vent in the bathroom. The lighting in the room was a bit dark. The internet was fine during off periods but during typical heavy periods (after people came in from working all day) the internet struggled to keep up. I would not have been so happy had I paid the 100AED per day for it. That is the UAE though in my experience so not just this property. The Club Lounge: The club floor was better than expected. I am not going to say anything crazy like it is the best ever but it was decent enough. Breakfast has your typical continental offering and also included two hot dishes including and egg dish and a meat dish. Worked for us. In the evening during happy hour there were some sweets and hot dishes that were pretty good but we only hit happy hour one day so can\u2019t comment beyond that one day. Service in the Club was very good. The club floor attendant had trouble keeping up during peak periods but they held up quite well and I don\u2019t think we wanted for anything. If you have it in your budget, I think it would be good value to book the club floor. Pool and Fitness: Spent a good amount of time at the pool. Keep in mind this is not a resort so although the pool area is not what you would find at the beach resorts in Dubai you also do not have to deal with a packed pool area. It was never too busy when we were there. The pool is good sized and great for laps but there is limited shallow water so if you don\u2019t like a deep pool this may not be for you. There is a kiddie pool though if you have children. There are separate health club facilities for men and women and I did not hit the gym but the sauna, steam room etc looked recently renovated and pretty solid. If you like to watch the planes overhead then it is nice to sit out at the pool and watch them fly pretty close overhead but if you do not fancy that\u2026\u2026it might not be so pleasant. The food service at the pool was via a phone and you basically called room service and the one time we ordered it took quite a while so be warned. Restaurants: There is Spice Island which had buffet for dinner and breakfast and I think ala carte during part of the day but not sure of the times. There is another place called Sails but it was not open during our stay, perhaps when they finish the renovation? There is a place next to Spice Island called Tikis which I did not see on the web site but it was basically a nicer bar with some appetizers etc. There was rarely anyone in there when we walked by. Finally there is Harrys Place which is where we did our dining when we ate at the hotel. It is a sports bar type place but a nice place with good service and decent food. I don\u2019t think I had a bad dish there. Prices are reasonable and it is fine for a decent meal at a reasonable price. Nothing fancy but they do have some dining specials, steak special when we were there that looked to be good value. We dined at Spice Island one morning for breakfast and it wasn\u2019t the greatest but it was cheap. I would say in the scale of breakfast buffets is it in the average category but ok for the price. Location: I am not an expert on locations in Dubai and reading reviews before booking it appeared there was not a perfect area to stay in. This property is very close to the airport (about 10 minutes with no traffic) and given the relative low cost of taxies in Dubai it is easy enough to just take a taxi to wherever you want to go. I did read some reviews on the property pushing the hotel taxi but I did not experience that. Every time I asked for a taxi they went out and got a regular taxi. Now one evening they did give us a hotel taxi and when I ask the price it was about the same as what I paid the previous day to the same location via a regular taxi so I went for it as it was a nicer car. I think in that instance they just didn\u2019t want to go get a regular tax and cut me a deal. I am sure that if they offer the hotel car and you refuse it will be no problem at all to get a regular taxi. Summary: I liked this property. The place is not the fanciest place and I am sure it is not as nice at the Crowne Plaza Festival City but the lounge is a nice benefit and the staff are great. This is definitely a solid business hotel but it is also fine for the leisure traveler as well especially on a short stopover given the close proximity to the airport. I think the meter on the way to the airport was about 15AED which is pretty cheap. I cant remember the exact cost of the trip to the hotel but it should have been about 20AED more as the meter starts at about 20AED more.
