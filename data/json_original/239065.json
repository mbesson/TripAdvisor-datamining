However, to balance out the great location, the hostel has a few flaws.\\ La Perla Asturiana claims that its staff speaks English. Unfortunately, that is only about ten percent true. The staff operates on a need-to-communicate basis, meaning if they don't have to dig out their English skills, they won't. The rooms are kept as clean as possible, which isn't saying much considering all of the furniture and bedding look as though they are extremely old. Still, all the necessities are there and the balcony, which allows you to step out into the fresh air, provides some form of satisfaction. Remember to bring your own toiletries.

The sign said that guests can come and go 24 hours a day, but we were told to get back early because the night-duty man wanted to go to bed and was locking the door. When we did get back, the local homeless drunks sang all night below our window, which was ancient and wouldn't close properly. This is apparently where the homeless drunks spend each night, singing ang kicking shop shutters. It was so loud but the police didnot come. Then the street cleaners came out at 3am and began very very noisily jet washing the square below our window. and then the refuse collectors/bin men/ garbage men came out and began very noisily emptying the bins/garbage. It was 4am when things began to quieten, and it was then that I began to be itch. I turned on the light, and discovered that the bed was full of bed bugs. Within 10 minutes we were covered in lumps all over our bodies, and my girlfriend had an allergic reaction to them. We had to hunt them down and kill them in the room before we could get to sleep, which was around 5am by this time, but even then sleep was the last thing on our mind. We told the man at the desk in the morning and he acted as if this happens all of the time. Maybe it does. Maybe if we had been sound asleep we wouldn't have felt the bites?

I'm used to staying in budget hotels and didn't expect any kind of luxury, but the quality of the accomodation was still well below my standards. The room was miniature and looked like a single room advertised as a double (until now I had no idea that a 120 cm bed can be called a \"double\"), no air conditioning, the bed was old, uncomfortable and squeaky and we had difficulty getting hot water in the shower. It looked fairly clean, but the bed linen and towels were so worn that it was difficult to say. Ear caps are a must if you want to get a good night sleep - every step and every word spoken in the hallway can be clearly heard in the room. Unfortunately I can't find any positive points except for the location, which is truly amazing - just around the corner from La Plaza Mayor! If you decide to stay here, make sure it's in a situation where you spend the whole day outside and only come to the hotel to sleep.

It has no food available, but drinks could be ordered. However, all you had to do was walk out the hostal entrance into the square and there were three cafes within a few yards, all offering a good selection of drinks and food, including cooked breakfasts for those who just can't do without the full English. Our room was cleaned every morning and although the room was small it was perfectly adequate for our needs. We had some noisy neighbours though which was a bit of a nuisance since they seemed to want to sit in their room and chat till the wee small hours instead of going to a bar to chat like every one else did. We will certainly be staying there again as it was very convenient for getting around the city from Sol Metro, a few minutes walk away. Being so central, a number of the city attractions were within easy walking distance, as was the tourist open-top bus which we highly recommend as a means of choosing where you'd like to visit.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wageningen", "Title": "\u201cIf i have to say it in one word, try bye your self\u201d", "Author": "RHaagen", "ReviewID": "UR26851042", "Content": "This hostel is in the heart of old Madrid an on a excellent location.

Advice: don't be conded into a taxi at the airport take the metro far cheap and not that difficult to find (print off a tube map and one of the hotel before you set off). Avoid eating in the plaza mayor the cafe outside the hostel is excellent and beaware of a club with severn floors (I have forgotten the name) as we were told it was cheap by some locals... is mucho dinero! but have fun with the whole city to explore we took in a football game as well, tickets booked on line- great seats fantastic game! adios", "Date": "December 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berkshire, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Location\u201d", "Author": "Shefford", "ReviewID": "UR7329842", "Content": "As noted by other reviewers, this hotel is in an excellent location, a few steps from the Plaza Mayor and a few minutes from the Puerto del Sol.
