Nice lobby area, but reception was minimal. Poor man or woman behind reception trying to manage everything (including bar area) on his/her own while other staff sat in the nearby telephone area. The first guest room offered was dismal with an awful odor. Second was acceptable but on closer look: frayed, moldy carpet, the bed mattress sagged, and overall the room was sad and outdated. Best thing was the bathroom: large and mostly clean. Went to the breakfast buffet in the morning, hoping for \"hotel redemption,\" but it was not to be. Very mediocre bread, practically not working toaster, less than average cereal and generic-tasting pastries. Plus the coffee was lukewarm (just as another TA review reported). I would say the reception person tried hard to please, but just couldn't manage the workload (I hardly blamed him/her). On a positive note, I was most appreciative when after two nights of extremely loud noise from a teenage tourist group, reception succeeded in quietening them down (Bravo!).

The carpet had stains so I guess they haven't upgraded the carpets in a while. My colleague stayed in a single room -- it was tiny, fitting not much else other than the twin bed and night stand, though the bathroom was an ok size. The buffet breakfast was very good with a large selection. If you want scrambled eggs or an omlette they will make it for you on request. The hotel staff was pleasant and responsive and didn't charge me to print out some documents. The location is good. It's on a well-known street and centrally located, near lots of shops and restaurants. Across the street is a large multi-level shopping mall. There is no metro within 1 or 2 blocks, but my colleague said he walked 10 minutes to a metro, so maybe that is close enough for some people. It was very easy to get a taxi in front of the hotel.

In short, we got good value for our money. 3. Location: It is within 30 minutes walking of Las Rambalas. It is not in the thick of things so I was able to sleep without hearing noise from the street, but there are several bus lines with stops right in front of the hotel for easy access to anywhere else in the city. 4. The staff were excellent. As strict Sabbath observant people we could not use our electronic key cards on Saturday, the staff were more than willing to go to the fifth floor to open our door for us.

This hotel was the \"budget\" part of the trip. This hotel was perfect for me - it met my list of \"musts\" (a private bathroom, cleanliness, and close to public transit) and it lacked only in areas that I don't care about (spaciousness and view). The only negative for me was the lack of sound-proofing... although it was very quiet 99% of the time, I could hear everything that was going on when someone walked down the hall, and when my neighbors shut their doors, my room felt like an earthquake. There is a lot of shopping nearby, but it is a very expensive part of town. However, the bus stops right in front of the hotel, and it takes you right to the metro - so all of Barcelona is easily accessible (for 5 euros, you can ride all buses and subways all-day). Hotel was very clean and the front desk staff was friendly and courteous - alhough I don't speak Spanish and their English was limited, I was able to convey to them that I had forgotten my electricity convertor and the clerk leant me one at no charge). Beware of the breakfast buffet - although their are signs for it everywhere that don't indicate a charge (possibly leading you to believe it is included at no charge), it costs 16 euros per person.

Room on 5th floor, decent size, good bathroom, plenty of towels, toiletries etc., very clean. No balcony, and at the back of the hotel, so quiet, but not very exciting view - ok for one night, but not so great for a week. Cost - 100 euros per night, room only. Didn't investigate breakfast, as took it out in a cafe - usually a better option with continental hotels. Location- on busy Av Diagonal. Residential and shopping area, quite classy. Bus stop right outside the door, and choice of several, plus others about 2 minutes away. The nearest metro was about 10 mins walk, downhill (but up on the return !), and not on a very good line for getting to most of the major sites - you needed to change for most things. However, the bus service is excellent, and if you avail yourself of a route map from the tourist office/ info kiosks it is very easy to follow, and much more flexible than the Bus Touristic, which many people recommend. especially if you fancy doing things that aren't necessarily \"touristy\". Buy a \"Barcelona Card\" - online, or from the tourist office - which is excellent value, as it gives you unlimited use of the metro/bus, plus free or discounted entries to numerous museums/attractions/restaurants etc. for between 2-5 days.

We got a cheap-ish deal staying in the Hotel Covadonga situated on the Av Diagonal.The Hotel was sold to us as being in the \"heart of the city\" well i would say more the left shoulder!!. From the airport a Taxi took us 25-30 Mins to reach the hotel at a cost of about 21Euros. First impressions of the hotel were nice building and clean. Staff were helpful on booking in. Tried to get a room with a balcony but was unsucessful. So we ended up in a room on the 8TH(TOP) floor. Pleasent room clen and tidy on a par with Travel Lodge in UK. The air con had seen better days and at top whack it still left the room feeling stuffy. The view from the window -well no view!!we were looking onto three walls. So out and about we went to get our bearings of the city. The hotel provide Maps leaflets for places to visit, On walking onto the AV Diagonal first impressions are a busy main road flanked by shops each side. Walking down it is soon clear that the street is a shoppers heaven clothe shops line the road, every designer you can think of has an outlet. A 15-20 Min walk got us to the PG Gracia the main street that eventually leads down to the Las Rambla (Gothic Quarter).Again every shop under the sun, I would recommend going off the main street to side streets to get a drink or something to eat, Better service not as busy. The top tip for travelling aroung the city is to buy a ticket for the open top Bus the \"Bus Turistic\" it cost us 21E each for a two day ticket. This allows you to travel as much as you like over the 2 day period. You can get on and off as many times as you like. There are 3 routes being red blue and green, Taking you to the north centre and south of the city. You buy the ticket on board the bus, there are numerous bus stops littered about the city. The q for the busses can be if you try to get on at the start of the route, so get on at a stop away from the main stops. Overall it was a nice city brake with lots to see and do. I would recommend if you want to be close to Gothic Quarter and las Ramblas, Harbour to avoid the Covadonga and aim for a more central Hotel.If you do stay in the hotel be prepared for a good 25-30 min walk each way to the Rambla and harbour.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Suffolk England", "Title": "\u201cexcellent!!!!\u201d", "Author": "English40", "ReviewID": "UR5794317", "Content": "Just returned from 4 days in Barcelona staying at this hotel.
