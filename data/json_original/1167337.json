Breakfast was adequate enough and the hotel was a welcome base to return to after long days exploring Paris. Overall, I would denifinitely return to this hotel.

It wasnt cheap and we probably wouldn't have stayed here if work hadn't been paying, but I'm very glad we did! For Paris, the room was big! We werent expecting big as we had stayed in cramped little rooms before in Paris, so this was a pleasant surprise. Room was clean and modern, the bathroom and kitchen clean and tidy. The window was large and opened right up so the room was light and cool. NB: The elevator is very small, you may have to do multiple trips with one bag per trip! In terms of location, Rue Cadet is small and crowded.. then again, the whole L'Opera 'area' seems to be crowded and small.. I would not recommend driving there. Our taxi wouldnt even go down the street, we were dropped at the closest intersection. One thing I found really hard was all the smoking in that area. I guess that's just Paris for you, but having a 5 month old with me was really hard as everyone was smoking in the street and the cafe's, especially around Rue Cadet. I tried to sit inside away from the smell (as it is harmful for babies) but people smoked in the doorways and it blew in anyway. Having said that, Cosy's is a pleasant surprise as you go through a small door and wander into a large courtyard that is spacious and out of the hustle and bustle - and the smoke! One complaint we have about Cosy's is the internet. It worked the first few hours we were there, then 'went down' and we didnt have it again for the remainder of our stay. Apparantly it was a problem with the whole street...?? In the end, to have internet, we had to pay for some 'Orange' time as the signal was available in that area. Finally, I would say that unless its included in your rate, dont pay for the breakfast. It is a very limited breakfast for an expensive price. There are cafe's at the end of Rue Cadet that are better. All in all, I'd stay here again!

Bad points \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 As mentioned on other feedback all room floors are tiled resulting in a certain amount of noise from guests in the room above; particularly when any furniture is moved e.g. dining chairs and when someone walks across the floor in hard heeled shoes. However, tiled floor gives an overall modern look to the room and keeps it cool in hot weather. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Shower is integral with the bath which may be unsuitable for anyone with a disability.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201ccame back again to Cozy, and better than before!\u201d", "Author": "LondonTigger1", "ReviewID": "UR72904330", "Content": "it was very nice to come back to cozy's residence this summer with my sister's family. they remembered us and told us that they improved the noise problem. in fact they carpeted in the hall which prevent much noise. i did not have any problems of noise at all. they also change to wireless internet connection. the things I like about this hotel is very friendly and welcoming us. all staffs are very helpful and trying to do their best all the time. only the downside of the hotel was that they put the price up this year and also the amenities (shampoo/soap/etc) used to be the ones from Loccitene, but this year was non-brand one. but these are minor things. also the other customers were mostly family with small children or decent people so that we did not hear any noise at night.(e.g young group of people having parties or something) all slept very well. close to gare du nord and opera.", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ardee Ireland", "Title": "\u201cA real family friendly place to stay with excellent service & location\u201d", "Author": "ArdeeIrelandPauliano", "ReviewID": "UR71624481", "Content": "The appartment was very well equipped and very spacious for us and our two young children and included a hugh wardrobe , Ironing facilities, Kitchen with fridge, kettle, cooker & microwave.

We stayed for seven nights and every one offered a good nights sleep....Yes you could hear a few noises from the appartment above but all in all every one enjoyed a good night sleep. The only thing that some people may find a problem with is that the bedroom areas were both open plan offering little privacy from anyone in the sitting area, but after hours of walking around, looking at the sights, there was no diffuculties getting the kids to sleep. The place itself was in an excellent location and offered easy access for both Metro and RER links to the ususal sights and Disneyland. infact, it only took 40-45 minutes to get to Disneyland by Metro & train with no difficulties. Walking around the area offered loads of places to sit and eat ( and drink) and if you were brave enough to cycle around the city, the city-bikes were located just a minute away from the appartment. The appartments were in a secure off street complex with secure doors at the street that would close in late evening till morning with residents only able to gain access. The best thing is that you could get out of the appartment in the morning, nip across the road to the patisserie and bring back your delicious croissants, bread or indeed delicious eclaires that one can only experience in france. A supermarket was located 1 minute away so you could maintain your supplies of coffee & Tea and fresh milk.

There was one person on reception when we checked in and I felt a bit sorry for him because he was there all day alone, he was there the next morning and when we ordered room service breakfast he also brought it up for us himself on a tiny plastic tray which couldn't hold everything, so he had to come up three times with all the breakfast on it. They advertise room service, but it wasn't remotely organised, as he seemed to have no idea what he was doing or what to bring up to us. He told us we had to make our own tea as he couldn't bring that up, he didn't bring any milk and we had to ask him to bring up the fruit and yogurt twice before he did. About 5 or more other times during our stay we went down to reception and no one was was there at all! One time we waited almost 20 minutes for a member of staff to arrive at reception and when he did, he arrived with a big box of take-away, he had gone out to get himself some dinner whilst on duty, which he then proceeded to eat at reception! We didn't see any management there at all during our 3 night stay, no one seemed to be available to talk to about this and there was never more than one person on reception at a time. On many occasions we could not find any staff at all! For a 4 star establishment, or any kind of hotel or apartment this is simply unacceptable. I'm not sure if they had staffing problems this particular weekend or if it is always like this, the staff offered no apologies for being absent. It really let the place down and it meant we had to do a lot of unnecessary waiting around, which was a pain for us when we were only there for a weekend. Overall the apartment was lovely, but they need to get some more staff and if they are going to offer room service this needs to be properly organised rather than getting the staff member on reception to bring it up by himself, leaving reception unattended in so doing. I would stay again if they sorted the staffing problems out, because otherwise we had a great time, the location is peaceful and central for getting around all the sightseeing spots in Paris and the apartment was fantastic and had pretty much everything you would need for a long weekend.

If you did want to take the metro which was easy to use there is a station just at the top of the street on Lafayette.
