The hotel is very close to the airport but no airport noise. It seems that it's a business area nearby and we did get traffic noise from the road. Decent size car park. The light rail is only a couple of blocks away and at only $1.75 for a single trip (85c for seniors) it's surprisingly cheap (the light rail in Las Vegas is $5 per trip with no discount for seniors!). Although, make sure that Phoenix is open when you go - virtually everything was shut when we were there. As it's a Hampton there is no restaurant but you do get a microwave and fridge.

Sure enough the hotel is surrounded by more upscale properties, it has the feel of a business park and we never heard a siren or saw anything suspicious. The local police seem to make a habit of having breakfast at this location which added to the secure feeling. The staff was efficient but not overly friendly, the breakfast leader was impatient with one of the older guest who needed a little help. The hotel itself was OK, seemed a little bit older and perhaps in need of a good scrubbing and a touch up here and there but it fit our needs and we slept very well. The rooms were very quiet and beds were comfortable with that typical lumpy Hampton comforter, the towels were thick and soft. Breakfast was disappointing, scrambled eggs were dry (not sure if they were real or not). Eggs and gravy were the only hot items, other than the typical make your own waffles, it looked like any other breakfast at less expensive hotel chains. There was a lack of restaurants close by, we had to drive to eat dinner. We thought it was overpriced but that's probably the going rate in Phoenix in the winter.
