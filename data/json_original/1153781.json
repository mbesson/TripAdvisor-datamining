The room was clean with a nice en-suite bathroom. We had a good laugh with the bidet! The hot water takes a very long time to come though, and ladies there is no hairdrier. The breakfast is not in the building, you have to go to the restaurant next door where they give you a coffe and - depending on their mood - a croissant. If you are really lucky you might even choose your croissant. You'll have to stand up while having your breakfast.

I have made sure of it personally. First, the day before my arrival I wrote a letter to the staff where I specified my flight's number and estimated time of the arrival at the hotel (about 20.30). Unfortunately, my wife and I received our luggage at the airport with considerable delay and came to the hotel at 20.55. We ringed the bell, but nobody answered us. There were no staff at the hotel! It was our first time in Rome, and we were forced to seek another hotel for one night (and to pay 80 euro for this). The next morning we came to La Casa, its owner was on her place, and she said to us that she had waited for us the night before till 21.00 (it was not true, because we came at 20.55!), and then... went home. Moreover, she forced us to pay the full sum (including the night already paid by us at another hotel!), repeating many time: \"It's your problem, not mine!\"; and saying that we must pay in any case, because we had already confirmed our reservation, and if not, she threatened us to call the police! Second, her welcoming was extremely poor,she behaved as if we were somehow obliged to her. Third, at the main page of the official site of La Casa it is said: \"We offer a traditional Italian breakfast which consists of croissants, biscuits, various jams, butter, nutella, coffee, cappuccino, tea, hot chocolate and fruit juices\". But during our stay (6 days) we were receiving for breakfast ONE croissant, ONE biscuit, ONE jam, ONE nutella, ONE tea or coffee for a person and NO BUTTER, HOT CHOCOLATE OR FRUIT JUICES AT ALL. Tea and coffee were almost cold, and we had the impression that they were diluted with warm tap water. Finally, the staff gave to us no information about the city's museums and events which is contrary to what is said at the site. There were also some other minor negative points related to this hotel. So, if I come to Rome next time, I will NEVER stay there.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cGood Budget Option\u201d", "Author": "Kiwidreamer", "ReviewID": "UR74224723", "Content": "I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from. Not sure if people haven't done their research so don't know what sort of property they are coming to. I was somewhat nervous about what to expect given 2 extremely negative reviews posted after we had booked but before we had got there. If you read the posts here and know that Alexandra does not live on the property so you have to make sure you give her a time you are arriving and stick to it or let her know ahead of time it has changed and accept at the very cheap price you are paying that breakfast is not going to be a wondrous feast but does cover the basics then this place is just fine. We were a bit unsure of exactly what time we would be arriving due to the fact we were dropping our rental car at Rome airport after a week's sightseeing but Alexandra made it very clear to us ahead of time that we needed to give her a firm time of arrival so that she could be there to meet us. So we set a time that we knew we would definitely be able to be there (barring catastrophes). As it was we got to the airport earlier than expected so texted Alexandra to see if we could bring our arrival time forward by a couple of hours. She was very prompt in replying and advised us unfortunately she couldn't be there earlier. No problem, we knew the deal ahead of time. We spent the time having a snack and people watching. For those worried about the area the B&B is in...yes it is not in the best neighbourhood but it is extremely close to Termini station and there are 2 restaurants very close to it with tables on the footpath so if you're a bit early either kill time at Termini Station at the cafe there or wait beside one of the restaurants and you will be fine. Alexandra was extremely prompt arriving exactly on the agreed time. I'm not sure if us ringing the doorbell just prior to arrival prompted this or it was coincidence (I suggest you ring it in case). Our room was very clean, our bathroom very small - as were all our accommodations in Italy, and Alexandra very helpful answering all our questions happily. We heard no doorbells ringing through the night and had a very good night's sleep here (both nights we were there). The location was a great starting point for getting to all the famous city centre locations we were interested in other than the Vatican. We didn't get there this trip but from my reading I believe the Metro from Termini station would get you there easily. My advice to those that complained about the breakfast - don't expect the Ritz at the price you are paying. Yes the breakfast is basic and the coffee not great but there are plenty of cheap food options nearby if you don't want to eat it...and you will have still saved money compared to what you'd pay elsewhere. In summary, if you are realistic about what you are getting for the price you are paying and are only there for a few nights, this place is just fine.

So I was really taken aback meeting this unfriendly lady in casa del'arte not!!! Although I told her the time of my arrival weeks before my arrival (by e-mail) she claimed not to have known about my arrival time (there is no reception in this accomodation). My knowledge of the Italian language (acquired at school, by traveling to Italy and through my friends who are native speakers) was sufficient to converse with the Roman people but one - with the lady in this accomodation it was neither possible to talk to neither in Italien, nor English or German. According to the hotel description the accomodation offers a luggage deposit for 2\u20ac --> this information is not true! Instead the lady referred me in a quite unfriendly tone to the luggage deposit in stazione termini. Location: only a few steps from the metro and bus station; but the homeless people gather around the hotel all day drinking schnaps and at nights you have to reckon to get awakend by the bell (of course I didn't open the door, but I guess the homeless people tried to get into the warmth) Breakfast: a cracker, a croissant and coffee (thermos flask) served outside the room because the establishment has no breakfast room. coffee was sometimes ok, sometimes absolutely unenjoyable. once they seemed to have forgotten to do the washing up because the day after I could find remainings of the coffee in the cup. I could proceed my list with negative impressions but I guess this description gives you an expression what awaits you there. To sum up, I can say Rome is a beautiful city (December is perfect for sight-seeing!) with great sights and friendly people and I am sure to return there soon - but next time I definitly won't choose case del'arte!!!", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portugal", "Title": "\u201cExtremely unfriendly\u201d", "Author": "emediquei", "ReviewID": "UR51664219", "Content": "The first problem was that, instead of a double room, we were given a twin room with the two beds stuck together, which is quite uncomfortable.

The bathroom was small but the water in the shower was hot and a hair dryer was provided. The room was clean upon my arrival and cleaned daily. There was a safe in the room, which came in handy. (There was no alarm clock--I used my cell phone alarm.) I'm not much of a breakfast person but a simple breakfast buffet was provided that included toasts, breads, muffins, jams, etc. The price was reasonable as well, especially considering the prices in Rome. The location was great--a three minute walk from the Roma Termini train station. I was able to walk to every attraction I wanted to see, including the Vatican. It was a pretty multicultural area too, so if you tire of Italian food, there is Chinese and Indian food just around the corner. There was no wi-fi or internet connection in the room but there was an internet cafe around the corner that was very reasonably priced and run by very nice people.
