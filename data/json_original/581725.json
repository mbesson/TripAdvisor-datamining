We arrived by car so had to park in Sainsbury\u2019s across the road which has 2 hour free parking for customers. We entered the pub which was full of people watching the football. The guy behind the bar went to find the manager who then had to go and find the key for our room? I asked 2 to 3 times about the parking? After a bit of whispering with their backs turned on us the \u2018manager\u2019 said just park up the street at the side of the pub? The room looked recently decorated and new carpet had been put down. The bed \u2013 metal creaky metal IKEA type looked new and the bedding was ok. The curtains were so thin the road lights etc shone through all night. There was a sink in the room which had a sign says \u2018please do not use\u2019 and we had to share a toilet down the corridor which both were clean and plenty of loo roll, soap etc. Bathroom? No idea we were up and gone by 6am because of the parking. The pub doesn\u2019t open until 12 noon so you have to leave the key in your room which means you can\u2019t lock it? Not sure how you get on if something goes missing? There were still areas in the corridor where the ceiling was covered in damp/wet/mould? Breakfast \u2013 In room - 2 small boxes of cornflakes UHT skimmed milk and an orange juice in the fridge. There is a small worktop size fridge in the room with a small TV balanced on it! Didn\u2019t try it to see if it worked though? There was a couple of towels supplied and kettle with tea, coffee and sugar. When the pub is closed ie before 12 noon and after 11pm you have to enter the hotel via the back up 4 flights of fire exit which in the dark and rain can be a challenge and if you don\u2019t like climbing steps where you can see between them or you don\u2019t like heights this isn\u2019t for you! If you want to park don\u2019t bother booking this \u2018hotel\u2019 If you want a good night\u2019s sleep don\u2019t book this \u2018hotel\u2019 If you\u2019re not bothered and its only for a few hours you should survive!", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "swindon", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "napmum", "ReviewID": "UR124676676", "Content": "Squeaky bed, mould in shower room, breakfast box of cereal in your room with UHT milk & carton of Capri-sun!

We are backpackers, and travel cheaply - we do not have high expectations at all. I have to say that I was appalled at this accomodation. It's possible that our room was unfortunately one of the worst, but the bed squeaked horribly and was very old. It did not help us to feel rested for the long days of walking around the city. The television was ancient, tiny, and non-functional anyway. The carpet was filthy, the in-room sink nasty, and the dishes for tea and cereal were so gross that we didn't feel it would be sanitary to eat from them. So much for saving money each morning on food. The bathroom on our floor does not appear in any pictures anywhere online, which makes me wish I had taken some so I could post them. I have stayed in lots of hostels in lots of countries, and I have to say that was the. Most. Disgusting. Bathroom. Ever. I have had cleaner toilets on the desert road between Alexandria and Cairo. Seriously. We didn't mind the fire escape entrance or the pub downstairs (we quite liked the pub, actually. Watched a bunch of football and got drunk enough to forget where we'd have to pee and sleep later), and the junction location was okay for us - we enjoyed the walk to the tube each morning, and having the shopping center across the street from the pub was helpful. We like the hostel experience and being outside of the city center, and I can understand the older amenities and mismatched furniture - no problem. But I cannot accept the lack of basic sanitation, the moldy sink, unclean dishes, and a shower that is truly one of the worst travel experiences of my life. Choose another hostel and keep from getting sick - or just really grossed out.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackpool, England", "Title": "\u201cA Beacon of Hope\u201d", "Author": "Bushbaybee", "ReviewID": "UR119103810", "Content": "After checking into and straight back out of a terrible hotel in Finsbury Park we were stuck in London without a room - we wanted to stay in this area as it was within walking distance of the Emirates stadium for the Arsenal match.
