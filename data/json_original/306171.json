The minimum stay is 7 nights but this is a great alternative to a hotel for a family stay. We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. Very spacious and nice facilities. We did however have some issues with some appliances but because our stay was relatively short and we were so busy over Christmas we didn't really address them. We had 2 bathrooms and the drainage in the shower of the 2nd bathroom was terrible. The hot water in this bathroom was only luke warm too. It was easier just to use the one bathroom. The dryer fried some of our clothes so we used the combo washer and dryer which had a long cycle and wasn't very effective- the clothes were still damp at the end. The airconditioning in one room wasn't effective but was great in the other two outlets so we just let it go. If we were staying a few months it would have been worth investigating and I'm sure they would have addressed our concerns. The staff were great and very polite. In the hotel there is a toddler pool, a kids playroom and a normal pool. The pool was spacious and very beautiful and never crowded. There is restaurant near the pool and breakfast was included on some of the days we were there.One of the best things about the hotel was the location. Situated in Robertson walk there is a supermarket across the road, a wine bar downstairs with reasonable prices and a myriad of restaurants everywhere. It was near the river and a very central location. You could walk to Clarke Quay , Mohammed Sultan Rd and Chinatown. Everywhere else is a short cab ride away. You can also walk to Orchard Rd but with young kids I would recommend an airconditioned cab!In short I liked the apartment style accommodation, the fabulous pool and the excellent location and overall would recommend the place.
