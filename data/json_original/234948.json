{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Distinctly Ordinary If your expectations are low or modest, or if you're a back-packer looking for a place where you can enjoy luxuries such as hot running water, you will probably find this place acceptable. If not, I suggest you don't bother. On the plus side, it's well located for the railway into the city, the service is friendly and the breakfast good. On the other hand, one needs to be wary of the fact that many of the rooms are actually in a different property from the one featured on the property's website. (You will need to specify a 1st category room to be sure of being in the main building.) I can only speak for the 2nd category rooms, but these are ordinary in the extreme - on arriving I felt positively home-sick. I concede that the prices are not steep but quite frankly a luxury hotel at twice the price would represent better value for money, at least for me. Manage your expectations carefully in advance of arrival.", "Date": "Aug 20, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR420608915", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Mayfair Ranger"}, {"Content": "Great for the price My boyfriend and I stayed at the Villa Toscana when we were in Berlin to catch the World Cup Final. The staff were very friendly and accommodating, and the rooms were simple yet very clean. The hotel is 700 meters from the Lichterfelde Ost S-bahn station (S25 line). If you don't mind walking a bit to and from the train station. Once you're on the train, you can easily access anywhere in Berlin. Central Berlin, such as Potsdamer Platz, is about a 20 minute train ride. If you want to walk out your door and be in the heart of Berlin, then this is probably not the hotel for you. However, if you want a clean, economical place to stay in a quiet suburban setting, with fairly easy access to the city, then this is a good place to stay.", "Date": "Jul 27, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR336021183", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "kbp"}, {"Content": "Jeannete and her family are very warm and friendly! My famiy and I stayed at the Villa Toscana prior to our move to Berlin. We found the surroundings beautiful. The hospitality was superb. Jeannete and her family made every attempt to ensure that our stay was a memorable one. The breakfast was excellent as well as the room accommodations.
