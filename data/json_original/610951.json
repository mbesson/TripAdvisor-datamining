{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good place to stay for the price - but only because of the price I stayed at Residenza Belli Hotel Florence on Nov. 27, 2008. The location of the hotel and the price was why we picked the place. For the price that we payed there isn't much to complain about. You have your own bathroom - they gave you towels, breakfast and your own room. The next time I go back we'll probably pay more and stay at a nicer place but it was only for one night and we were on a budget.Pro:1. Breakfast is included - cereal, bread and jam2. Location - 10 min walk from train station and duomoCons:1. The room smelled stale smoke even after airing the room for an hour2. One of the towel didn't look like it had been washed since it had makeup stain on it and since I dont wear makeup it couldn't be mine (it was foundation)3. The double bed was really 2 singles put together so it was a bit uncomfortable if you roll in the middle", "Date": "Dec 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR322897433", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "firestarlily"}, {"Content": "Good Room       room 3", "Date": "May 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR466679277", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RogerRiodeJaneiro"}, {"Content": "The staff was great but the hotel is not as it appears The best thing about Residenza Belli is the pair who runs it. I have to mention how helpful they were in checking us in, making restaurant reservations for us, and offering suggestions. If not for the the two of them, we probably would have left the next day.Unfortunately, the hotel itself was disappointing. The hotel occupies the 3rd floor of a building from the 1970's, which is also home to two other hotels (on separate floors) as well as dentists' offices and perhaps private apartments. The public stairwell and elevator shaft bisect Residenza Belli's floor so anyone in the building can walk up the stairs and right up to the door of your room.The signs on the building's front door include the other two hotel names and offices but not Residenza Belli, which is why everyone keeps missing it.When we arrived, someone buzzed us in and we took turns bringing our luggage to the 3rd floor using the one person elevator. Entering the dim hallway, the reception consisted of a small office desk pushed against a wall with the receptionist, his laptop, a fax, and a lot of paper. It turns out there is no reception--just a hallway where we awkwardly sat against a wall to check in. In short, someone converted some condominium units in a building and converted them into hotel rooms, unfortunately leaving out the reception and rest of the hotel.Although the room did have air conditioning as previous reviewers mentioned and the bathroom was spacious, the bedroom was tiny, maybe 10 sq.m. (100 sq. ft.), with a view of the courtyard. We could barely walk around the double bed. The TV was tiny and the remote control was missing. We also realized they did not change the sheets after they cleaned the room. The next day we did notice some other rooms which looked much bigger than ours.Overall, we felt that even if we had a decent-sized room at Residenza Belli and even if the staff were helpful, it wasn't enough to make up for the lack of lobby, services, signage, and security. The location was okay, but as others mentioned, the street is quite downmarket and the Lorenzo area at night may make some travelers uncomfortable. It was strange that they asked for a credit card guarantee but did not accept credit cards. We booked judging from the reviews and the website but it did not match the real thing.", "Date": "Apr 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR868250800", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "BigBalut"}, {"Content": "Nice place, comfy Walking distance from the main train station, San Lorenzo Market and Duomo. We brought the address along, many thanks to the earlier reviewers who advised us to do so. It is difficult to find it without the address as it is on the second or third floor of a building. Wonderful room with nice view of the Via Nazionale. Air-conditioning was okay. Fluffy towels which were changed daily. Room and sheets were clean. The desk people, Paolo and Gorgiana were helpful as we were non-Italian speakers! We were there in autumn, so it wasn't crowded at the breakfast room.Unfortunately, they don't accept cards.", "Date": "Jan 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR843510315", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Funky_gal17"}, {"Content": "Air conditioning a real plus, bathroom also very nice The Residenza Belli is very convenient to sights, train station, food, washerette (10-15 meters from the front door). Via Nazionalle is a not a high class part of town town like Via Tornabuoni by any means but it seemed safe, reasonabley priced, and during the hot Florence summer real air conditioning is a huge bonus and not something found in many medium priced accomodations. AC may not be at the top of everyone's list but summer in Florence is HOT and AC means you can sleep at night. The room we had was much larger than we expected, the bath recently redone had great tiles and everything was very clean. The sheets on the beds appeared to have been ironed before being put on the bed. Very nice. The young man who runs Residenza Belli works very hard to try to make sure everything is to your liking.Breakfast is across the street and the coffee bar there also serves some great pizza, panini etc. We enjoyed our stay and being able to access the internet through wireless was another bonus for those of us tied to our computers.", "Date": "Jun 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR158131163", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Ottimo Rapporto qualit\u813f Prezzo   showReview(14446887, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR128817327", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Ste76"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d610951-r22443613-Residenza_Belli-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "610951", "Price": "$128"}}
