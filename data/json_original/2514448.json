The room was plenty big enough, we had a corner family room - 1 mahoosive bed, 2 small doubles, and a cot, was on the 6th floor, so nice and quiet. Food was lovely, we had dinner and breakfast, both meals were good value for money, and really, really nice. Staff were friendly, although they had said about an easter egg hunt to my son, but there was no evidence of it in the morning :( - wasn't expecting anything tbh, but 6 year olds remember (and go on about) easter egg hunts!! Good position in which to explore the city by, tube station a couple of minutes walk away, and the staff were helpful when we needed advise. The thing that I liked the best is that it's no extra for families, than it would be for a couple, and this goes for all ppremier inns so I believe. Also kids breakfast was free (max 2 per 1 paying adult) Feel like we got a bargain, and in london, that's a bonus!!

Apart from these minor gripes, this hotel offers a great location for getting out and about in London, and is brilliant for going to the Hammersmith if you've a gig on (like I had)...and the attitude of the staff makes up for these moans too - they're all really friendly and helpful and were genuinely interested in what I had been doing that day etc. I'd definately use the Hammersmith Premier Inn again - its just a shame the small room etc dulled the shine on what would have been my best Premier Inn stay to date!", "Date": "March 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Molton, Devon", "Title": "\u201cYou get what it says on the tin!\u201d", "Author": "dollydollop", "ReviewID": "UR126492118", "Content": "A standard Premier Inn so you know what to expect when you open the door.

My only complaint is the ill mannered School children who where in the room across the hall from us and didn't think twice about running and shouting up and down the corridor and banging on each others door at 2am!!! dont know if this is covered under the good night gtee the PI's offer.

The building, from the outside, is not inspiring (but is easy to spot), a great concrete high rise, but then I was staying in it, not looking at it! There were some security measures in place (you had to use your room key to access the accommodation floors) which helped make me feel safe and secure. The hotel was well maintained and comfortable. The room I had was very small, although I expected nothing else for the price in London. It was fine for me, but a couple would have struggled a bit. The double bed was pushed up against one wall and floor space was minimal - there would have been a lot of edging past one another! The room was clean and well presented, and it had secondary double glazing to help deaden the noise from outside. The bed was what I would class as 'all right' - it certainly could have been a bit firmer but it was by no means was the worst I have ever experienced. The shower room was also clean. Again, it was small, and had no bath, but the water pressure was fantastic. Breakfast was fine, although some Premier Inns give a wider choice of breakfast, space in the dining room was constrained. Above all, the staff were fantastic - all very helpful and courteous. The hotel is roughly 200 yards from a tube station.

I had a corner room and the views were amazing - also it was really quiet. The room was as expected for a Premier Inn, so I was happy with this and the facilities. I did eat in the restaurant (mainly as I didnt have much time), however I probably wouldnt do this again. The soup (smoked tomato) was asty but so boiling hot it had to have been heated up in a microwave. It was unbelievably hot - so took quite a while to eat. This meant (I think ) my main course sat on a hot plate for a long time: I had a special salmon with caper sauce, brocolli and new potatoes. Sounded nice but was all overcooked. In summary - would I stay here again? If I needed to be in Hammersmith yes, but if I was visiting London on holiday I would want to be closer to the centre.

Even a good full-length mirror with excellent lighting and a hair dryer with a long cable. I was shattered after a very long and busy day. All I wanted was a bite to eat and go to bed. I went to eat in the restaurant, I was asked how many the table was for. I replied that it was just me and saw I was the only one in the place. The manager replied that I was not on my own as he & the waiter would look after me. I thought that was a lovely touch. I felt a bit guilty when I saw I could have pizza in my room.

The waiter offered to carry it to my room - I declined as a few people had started to arrive. I slept like a log and heard no noise in the corridor even though I was by the doors/lift. Breakfast was a buffet but with poached/boiled eggs/porridge on request. There was no queuing to make toast, pour drinks etc. and I only waited a few minutes for my poached eggs. I don't know what some people expect. But the couple on the table next to me moaned that the buffet was not fresh and food had been hanging about. It was not and had not - the food was not piled high and was being refreshed regularly as it was in small containers and the place was full of people wanting the full English.

I wasn't too sure what to expect, because when I got off the bus, the Premier Inn was towering high in the sky in the near distance. As I got closer, I could see that it was a very old building, possibly ex Council offices, so I climbed up the stairs and in to a seating area with trepidation. Down some stairs was the reception desk with what looked like two positions, both of which were manned and busy. To the left of reception was a small bar. Once it was my turn to check in, I was very pleasantly surpirsed at how friendly and professional my welcome was. Power to your elbow R.K, you explained everything to me as I would expect to hear it. You told me about the Good Night Guarantee, what time the breakfast was served and even introduced me to your colleague at reception. I was allocated a room on the 13th floor and here I have a word of caution. The lift only goes up to floor 12, so if you are old or have loads of luggage this is not the floor for you! Before I went out for the evening I decided to give the bar a try and on offer and available were Stella Artois and Carlsberg which equates to a 100% availability of lagers offered. What really surprised me was the price for a pint of Stella, where I was charged \u00a33.20. Now this is 35p cheaper than another Premier Inn that I recently stayed in. I decided to have a couple more pints before I left and again, the barman was great. He was attentive and on top of his job. On my return, I had another couple of pints and again, the barman was good and at the end of his shift, he even took the time out to say goodnight to the three of us that were sat at the bar. Something that is sadly lacking in the majority of hotels. Unfortunately though, all was not well and I had the following issues which I discussed with the manager the next morning.I was allocated a room on the 13th floor and the room was the closest room to the lift machine room and all night long I listened to the drone of lift machinery. Also the room was cold, so I turned the air conditioning on by using the control on the wall that looked like it had come out of the Ark. Having said that, it was fit for purpose but when the air conditioning started its heating cycle it began to make noises like running water-a bit like sitting next to a fountain. So I turned the air conditioning off and resorted to turning on the convector heater that had been provided. This was not, unfortunately, enough to overcome the gale that was blowing under the door. Otherwise, although very dated the room was O.K. In the morning I ventured down to the ground floor for breakfast and was amazed at how small in proportion to the whole establishment the main eating area was. But again, if it was not for the efficient way the breakfast staff buzzed around, the room would have got clogged up. The staff kept on top of clearing the tables and did well at keeping the guests flowing through the small area. I want to point out before I write any more that I am not a freeloader looking for a free room but I felt compelled to speak to the duty manager about my experience in my room and straight away, without any hesitation I was offered a refund. I declined the refund on the basis that all I wanted to do was to point out the areas of my stay that didn't delight me. The guy wrote down my comments in a notebook that he got out of his pocket and I am confident that he will follow through on the assurances he gave me regarding addressing my issues. He did, however, offer to book me a taxi to Kings Cross station at the hotel's cost which I accepted. The guy that dealt with me was Ash and I would like to say thank you for the professional way you dealt with me. So take note, Premier Inn, here you have a hotel where the staff are a credit to you. It's just a pity that this model does not extend to some of your other hotels.

The reviews on Trip Advisor helped us make that decision to pick this hotel. We were not quite aware of how far we were from Hammersmith tube station. It was a good 10-15 mins walk. Upon arrival, the reception lounge was noisy & filled with students. We could barely get through with the pushchair & suitcase. The room itself was very compact and our 2 year old daughter's bed was merely a mattress on the floor right next to our bed. The room was clean, comfortable and neat with everything we required to stay. Bath, shower, tv, soft duvet, hairdryer, air conditioning, lots of lighting, towels, tea, coffee, kettle etc... Our first night, we could not find anywhere suitable in Hammersmith to eat, so we ended up back at the Inn, after a drink at The Rutland Arms on the Thames off Hammersmith Bridge which was nice. We'd already paid to have a continental and premier breakfast, but the staff were more than happy to change this so we could have their \u00a322 meal deal which included a very nice 3 course meal, with drink & the full brekkie! We were more than delighted with this great deal. The staff were very polite and friendly at all times. They could not be more kind, always greeting us and chatting to our daughter and making her laugh. They offered us extras like hot chocolate for our daughter and the option to have poached or boiled egg, if required. Our room was situated on the 2nd floor at the front side of the building, the view was of the road, car park and a skip (although we were informed of refurbishments going on before we booked, which did not interrupt us at all). At night it was very loud. Our room was near the stairs too, so we could hear people going up them late at night and into the hall. Outside traffic could be heard late at night and early in the morning. The binmen arrive early Monday morning too. I think Premier Inn would have been better putting us in a room at the top as we have a small child and will be using the lift anyway, so we would not be disturbed at night. The lower level floors could be used for the students and younger singles who are there to stay up late etc...

Room cleanness overall was acceptable for a 3 star hotel. Room was very tight, too tight, but for two days still ok. The bathroom looked newly tiled. Standard bath furniture, everything unbroken and clean. However, being 6.1 ft tall, it took some time to get a shower, anything but enjoyable: shower head not adjustable in height, so that I had to uncomfortably bend over while hair washing. Ceiling height was much too low, made me feel a bit under pressure. Bed was too short for regular European people caused mainly by an overhanging part of the wall at the head of the bed leaving just a few inches of head room. Fortunately, the bed could be easily pulled forward. Matressee was rather comfortable compared with all the other hotel matressees I can remember of. Carpet has already lived its live. Since a nice carpet deals as a sort of highlight of a room, in terms of customers' satisfaction I think a new one would really pay off. TV was fantastic. Big flat screen with a perfectly clear picture. Plus point. Windows' quality was a bit disappointing. Old glas, broken and ugly looking window frames. Durty little chamber in front of the window. The view, however, towards the London skyline (from the 11 th floor or so) is breathtaking. Never seen anything comparable. This view has risen my overall rating. The 12th floor too kept most noise to a minimum yet there is lots of traffic all around the hotel and clock. Receptionists and all the other staff were very kind and forthcoming.

However, the beds are really comfortable (inc. decent pillows) and the curtains are heavily backed to prevent light entering, also the windows are doubled (external set / air space / internal set) inhibiting most sounds from entering. The only noise problems can occur from guests within the hallways (which are narrow). The rooms contain basics; TV, kettle (with coffee/tea etc), hairdryer, storage cupboard, spare pillows/blankets, telephone etc etc.....but no fridge (2 x vending machines in reception and a 24/7 across the road - which has a large selection of fresh fruit/veges aswell.) The bathrooms are clean but very small and constrictive (ie. you cannot sit on the toilet squarely and if you're a person of a large build it's a tight fit to get into the shower). This is probably the only real let down, yet all the facilities work fine and there are free liquid soap dispensers for use. The towels are not brand new, but very large and of an OK quality. The 22GBP meal deal is really good value and consists of a 3 course dinner (modified but good choices) with one beverage and an 'all you can eat' buffet breakfast with loads of choices both hot and cold. The food quality is pretty good and a surprise for the price charged. The strongest asset this property has is the excellent staff they have, both in reception and in the restaurant - namely Mailys (super efficient, attentive waitress and very pretty - great smile), Ginerva (brilliant, friendly receptionist), Rikesh (professional front office / reception) along with many others who I have forgotten their names...SORRY, but you are all great.

Also had a small LCD freeview TV and a lovely letter from the general manager offering extra sheets instead of duvets because of the hot weather (as well as air con and available fans). There was no noise from other rooms and if you have the window open you will get some noise, but with it being on the outskirts of London its far, far less than normal.

We had continental breakfast on the first day which was a great selection of cereals, pastries, yoghurts, fruits and toast, with plenty of hot and cold drinks all constantly topped up.

Freshly cooked breakfast which was very tasty.

The view however was great, We reported several issues to staff who seemed indiferrent, which is unusual for a Premier Inn. Breakfast was chaotic. Not enough staff or food laid out or space. Again, this is unusual for a Prmeier Inn. By the way, I have noticed in my last few stays at a Premier Inn that the buffet breakfast (one of their pluses) doesnt represent such good value - price has gone up, selection has gone down. On the plus side, the hotel was very well placed for the M4 and west London (we were in London for a football match at QPR, museum visit, and a theatre show) and had good parking. The trip was part of a Christmas present , and we went for a family meal at an Indian Restaurant opposite the hotel, called Indian Zing.

I did not have a say in where I got to stay and having travelled the world and stayed primarily in genuine premier hotel groups, I was not looking forward to my stay at a budget hotel. However, having been checked in to a 2nd floor room all of which are refurbished I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the room. However, the claim of a good night sleep on the hypnose mattress is not so as I found the beds in each of the rooms I stayed in to be extremely uncomfortable and awoke each morning with a stiff back and aching ribs!!! Having arrived at the hotel in week 3 and been greeted by Jane who I will say is an extremely professional and pleasant member of the team, was allocated room 211 which I had stayed in during the previous week and was very happy to be staying there again. Regretabley, during the two nights of my stay I was horribley bitten over 35 times on my arms and legs and it was only on the morning of my departure that the Operations Manager admitted there was a current infestation problem in the hotel which was being treated by a company called Ecolab. So if you are about to check in and see their vans parked outside, carry on walking and find another hotel elsewhere!!! A colleague had overheard a conversation that several rooms were being treated on another floor at the time!!! I had to return to the hotal the following Tuesday for another 2 night stay and was extremely worried as having spoken to Environmental Health, I was advised bedbugs are extremely difficult to get rid of once they are established as they can hibernate anywhere in a room for months at a time, and are easily transferred between rooms through air conditioning ducts, by the cleaners as the move from room to room and so on!!! I was assured by the Operations Manager that I would be well looked after with a good room (I was not, as I was allocated a standard room after being in a family sized room for the previous 2 weeks and had to complain before being moved!) Other issues with the Operations Manager made me realise that the management didn't care for their customers despite stating they did have a bedbug infestation problem and I had been a victim! So my advice to anyone thinking about going to a Premier Inn and this one in particular is, you will be paying them a lot of money (no where near the so called \u00a329!!!) for a night's sleep in a bed that will at least be pretty uncomfortable but could also include some nasty critters leaving you with bites that will itch for at least 5 days which antihistamines do not relieve, AND also LOOK extremely unsightly.

Checked in rather late, past 9pm, and was really only interested in quick shower and quiet sleep. But I had several smaller issues that really hurt my experience. First, seems like quartz heater was provided only for heating. There was an instructions leaflet on the table on how to activate \"real\" heating, and I've spent good 10 minutes in trying to do so, but without any success. So I decided to give the quartz heater a go; I was a bit uncomfortable in keeping it turned off throughout the whole night (quartz heaters are oftentimes causes of a fire), but this one was protected well, and it worked fine after all. But it would good, if indeed heating is broken in this room, that an info on using alternative heater is provided. Further, I found this shutter, that is closing the outtake of the water from the sink in the bathroom, is broken - so the sink would fill up with the water, and then the water would go out through that emergency aperture near the top of the sink. Also, the desk lamp was not working either. But I was really not into the mood of calling the desk to fix all these things, so I just went to sleep. I slept well, as I was pretty tired, but still I noticed the level of noise is rather high: the noise from the city traffic was significant, but even worse was the noise of some kind of very large fan, seemingly operating somewhere in the hotel building (as the noise seemed clearly distinct from the outside noise). I found the noise biggest issue in my stay, and in that regard, it was especially strange that this hotel is claiming \"good-sleep guarantee\". In the morning, I've enjoyed nice view to the neighborhood (piece of Thames was visible from my room), but again some kind of curtains are put between two level of windows, and it's really hard to move them to the side to enjoy the view. Final issue I had was about the breakfast: again, there was a leaflet in the room, and I understood there exist two options, quick fixed meal for approx. 3 pounds, and eat-as-much-as-you-can from both cooked and continental menu for 8 pounds; girls at the dining room offered continental menu only to me though, and only near the completion of the breakfast I saw other people having stuff from cooked menu delivered. Finally, I was charged 5 pounds something, which obviously means continental and cooked menu are priced differently; the food I ate was good, but I was really in the mood for something cooked, and I think all the options should be clearly stated both in the leaflet, and by staff in the dining room. So, my overall impression on the hotel is really average.

Stayed there for 3 nights. I work in the tourist industry and visit many hotels and lots have been premier inns so here is a honest opinion on this hotel. On arrival i was offered a room on the 3rd floor which was like a box room, ok for one night, but with me staying 3 nights i wanted better then this room. There was no problem in changing my room. The staff at the reception were more then helpful, and within 30 mins of my issue i was offered a room on the 11th floor. Best thing i could of done, the room was so much larger then my previous room, though i was informed it was a family room. Being up so high the views from the window was great, i was able to see quite a distance, and was able to look out and see the thames. Decided to have my evening meal at the premises on first night . Booked the table for 6.30 and order was taken straight away. However, the bad news was that my dinner did not arrive at my table till 7.15 between this time the waiter was full of apologies for the delay, and to be fair the staff were running around so not sure if this was a usual thing, but when the dinner finally arrived it was not the best meal i have ever had, but by this time i was tired and hungry and was past making a comment about it. But one couple with two restless children had arrived before me and when i had left the table i noticed though the children had had their meal the two adults were still waiting for theirs. My heart went out to them. But the next morning I found the breakfasts very good and excellent service and the staff were really friendly and made you feel that nothing was to much for them in trying to make your stay worth while. I was a bit disapointed though to find that each evening i returned to my room the room attendent had not topped up the tea bags, coffee ect. But as i had brought my own i never bothered to mention it. But i think these should of been replaced without the need of asking for more. The hotel was in a ideal area, The tube station is just across the road, and i was there to go to a show at the Hammersmith Apollo, it took no more then 15 minutes for me to walk it, but even if you did not want to walk its only one station away and you could be there in minutes. Because the hotel is on the main street there are lots of shops for you to visit. A large supermarket is only a few minutes away. I found this hotel to be an ideal place to visit London. I have stayed at other premier inns which i found to be more modern i guess you could say this is a bit dated, but certainly not old fashioned, and i would most certainly stay there again when visiting this area. It was just a shame about the evening meal and i did not have another meal there so i cannot say if that night it was a one off but felt it should be mentioned.!!", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bellingham, Washington", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "BebeZed", "ReviewID": "UR49586645", "Content": "My stay at the Premier Inn Hammersmith was very pleasant.

I did not see an option to be emailed a receipt, which I needed for tracking business expenses. The connection usually showed as 20% signal strength but was generally acceptable; I had very few drop-outs. I did dine in the hotel restaurant. I dined there for supper and had a very nice chicken curry; the wait staff was attentive and the food top-notch. I also had the \"Premier breakfast\" which was also very good. Location is very good - the Ravenscourt Park tube station is but a short walk and from there it's easy to get to anywhere you want to go. There is a small 24 hour grocer across the street -- they have the most wonderful falafel meal in the cold case that is a wonderful alternative to dining out. There is a pub next door, and two or three doors down there is a very nice Thai market with all sorts of wonderful fresh herbs, packaged seasonings, and noodle cups. There are many restaurants nearby, offering a variety of cuisines; there are also a few fast food places within walking distance. There is plenty of shopping nearby. Also, it's a short walk to the Thames, where you can take a stroll. Very nice! In short, the Premier Inn Hammersmith helped make my stay quite pleasant.

The hotel itself was fine, pretty average really, apart from the beds, which truly were VERY comfortable (as the company promise). Check-in was a hassle-free affair, and the staff were very friendly indeed. They were happy to answer questions, and offer directions to the event we were heading to. Our room was a good size with an equally good sized bathroom, with pretty boring, but not unpleasant, views across the car park. Most importantly, the room had air-conditioning, which was much appreciated after a 1hour trip on the underground on a 30 degree centigrade day...Moreover this was GOOD air-con (and anyone who stays in hotels regularly will apreciate this I'm sure!). The bathroom was a bit basic, and took an AGE to get any hot water through the taps, despite turning my hand to all the tricks in the book to get them to run warm. But it had everything I needed; bath, shower, etc. Functional I believe is the word... The room and bathroom were both immaculately clean, but there was a slightly odd, almost damp smell in the room, which I see another reviewer has mentioned. It was innocuous, but not being able to open the window didn't help. It didn't bother me in the slightest but it was noticable when I walked in the door The room was quiet, as I say we stayed on a Saturday night in the school summer holidays and we didn't hear a thing, either from other rooms or from outside. Such a relief and a change from some other, more expensive hotels! Breakfasts were good, but quite expensive for what is on offer (as I often find). Guests would probably do better to head out to one fo the local delis or cafes (5-10 mins away) to pick up a bite, but what was on offer in the hotel was perfectly passable and the staff serving were very kind and helpful. All in all a very good, middle of the road London hotel. It's nothing special, but great if you need to head to West London for whatever reason, it's a safe bet. Would I stay here again? Sure, so long as the 4* wasn't cheaper again!", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "solihull", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "Smokey02", "ReviewID": "UR6610849", "Content": "Myself and my mother had a family room with a king size bed, a single bed and a mattress on the floor.
