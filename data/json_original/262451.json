My son had an equally dismal room with a sagging mattress, perfunctorily cleaned, a very suspect carpet and a perpetually occupied shared bathroom. The proprietor, when asked to fix the shower door, made soothing noises, came to inspect, clucked over it, forced it back on its track, which lasted for a few minutes, and did nothing further. He made some risible concession on the price. I paid, but after I returned to finally pick up suitcases, there was suddenly another charge of 300 pounds -- he had \"forgotten to charge for the final days.\" We had a bit of a row over it and split the difference in the end.

Anyway, even though breakfast tomorrow morning is included in the price (a steep 130 pounds for the room, by the way), neither my partner nor I will have a bite to eat in this place. If there are mice on the third floor, I don't even want to know what the kitchen looks like.
