The rooms are large, airy and beautifully furnished. The views out across the paddy fields are sublime. The room was clean and everything worked. Breakfast was adequate and the whole experience was excellent value - we paid about 20GBP per night incl breakfast.As other reviewers have mentioned it is some way out of the main centre of Ubud - but the hotel do have a complimentary shuttle to the centre 3 times a day and taxis are relatively cheap at other times. Plus the peace and quiet of this hotel compared with the noise and congestion in Ubud makes a few taxi rides well worth the hassle!Ubud itself is a great place to spend a few days when in Bali and there are plenty of things to do and see in the town itself or nearby. We found it was worth hiring one of the taxi drivers for half a day to go to a few of the local sights - much cheaper than booking an organised tour. This is before I even mention the shopping - which is fantastic! Like everywhere in Bali be prepared for loads of stray dogs, some rubbish in the streets and plenty of people trying to sell you everything you could possibly want and more than a few things you could never want! Smile and enjoy the experience and then go back at night to the peaceful haven of Junjungan.One downside - the hotel does not serve food other than breakfast so make sure you have dinner before you go back to the hotel!", "Date": "Sep 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR542644938", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SomersetFlashpacker"}, {"Content": "Stunning view of paddy field ! Arriving late at night, the hotel lookws quiet and empty. Staff were however super friendly and efficient.This is not really a hotel. The reception did not have credit card facility and there was no pool. The best thing about the hotel however is the view of terraced paddy field and the fireflies at night!My room was huge and stunning. Most furniture around the hotels are locally made and are therefore unique. The bathroom was gorgeous and when my toilet did not flush well the first night it was repaired by the time I came back in the afternoon.The free chaffeur service to and from Ubud town was a great idea.This made the remote location of the hotel less of a problem.Hotel was scarily empty, during my three night stay, I did not see a single guest. There were certainly guests as I saw some rooms with light but never saw anyone when I walked in and out of the reception. Breakfast was either Indonesia or Western. Don't go for the Indonesian one as it was only the awful Mee goreng, orange cordial and coffee. You could have the breakfast in the room if you like which was nice. Overall, great boutique hotel at very low price, suitable for a quietbreak or romantic gateway. Ubud is much more interesting than the touristy Kuta where the beach is not great and wave too high. Only reason to be in Kuta is for shopping and dining.", "Date": "May 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR667153804", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "AlexMcca"}, {"Content": "Hidden paradise This hotel is stunning. Dont be put off when you arrive in Ubud as to how far out this hotel is. It is about 3km from the centre. Overlooking rice paddi fields the views are amazing. The rooms are huge with beautiful furnishings.The hotel offers complimentary transport all day and night into Ubud. This is such a great idea and they are always willing to pick you up night or day!.Well worth a visit if you are looking for peace and quiet away from Ubud main street but wanting to easily access the town.Ps You must try the food at Casa Luna in Ubud this was excellentEnjoy", "Date": "May 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR571336691", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Baliaddict"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d609896-r18263082-Junjungan_Ubud_Hotel_and_Spa-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "609896", "Price": "$85"}}
