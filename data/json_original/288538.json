Given the age of the HVAC systems it seems reasonable to question how bearable the room would be in summer; although aircon is available at an additional cost.

The room was okay, it was clean with a comfortable bed. The bathroom was clean but did smell a bit. breakfast was okay but not a lot of variety. However for the price and the fact that it is in Rome it was what I expected. I have three main problems with this hotel which would stop me from staying here again. Firstly; the hotel isn't in a good area, yes it is very close to the train but this is the olny positive the resturants around the hotel were not good and the area felt unsafe at night. If I ever go back I would pay the extra and stay in the older part of Rome. Secondly; there was aircon in the room but you had to pay to use it, this is really quite poor as the rooms are so hot. Finally the worst part of this hotel were the breakfast ladies. Two women served breakfast and one of the them was extremely rude, if you got a hello out of her you were very lucky. She looked around the room with an angry look on her face and made you feel very uncomfortable.

We also had a balcony which was fantastic as we could rinse out our clothes and dry them on the balcony quickly. (very convenient with the crazy roman heat!). Our bathroom was big and clean and it had a double shower. There was also a safe in the room. Breakfast was included in our booking but we only availed of it one morning. There were pastries, cold hard boiled eggs, tea and coffee and jams and juices. From our hotel we were able to walk to the colleseum and one day we walked to the Vatican city.

We arrived in Rome around 9:15 am and took the Leonardo Express train from the airport to the Termini train station. The hotel is very close to the Termini, so it was easy to find. We were able to check in early which was very nice and check in was easy and painless. We were given a room on the 3rd floor so we took the tiny elevator up to our floor. The room was fine as we were only using it to sleep and shower, but I would say it\u2019s only about a \u201c2 star\u201d hotel. There was a tiny safe on the wall and our window opened to a noisy street below. There was a small TV which we didn\u2019t really watch because we could not find any English stations. The bathroom and shower were decent, but note that this hotel did not provide any shampoo, conditioner, or lotion\u2014just soap. The room needed some updating\u2014it could use a fresh coat of paint on the walls and the bedspread could use a good cleaning. We removed it right away and stored it in the armoire. The bed was comfortable, but be sure to bring your earplugs because the street noise was terrible! We booked this hotel for several reasons, but one of the big reasons was because it said it had air conditioning. We weren\u2019t sure how hot it would be in Rome in September, so that was one thing we were looking for. Yes, this hotel does offer air conditioning\u2026.for an additional 10 Euros per night. We went ahead and opted for it because it was in the 80s and it was stuffy in our room, but it was a little disappointing to have to pay extra for it. The other reason we booked this hotel was because it said they offered free Wi-Fi. This is true, but you have to get a card from the front desk. The first night I was given two cards that would last for one hour each. The second night we went back for another card, and were then given a card that would last indefinitely. There was no extra charge for these access cards. One thing we really enjoyed about this hotel was their breakfast. Our room rate included breakfast so we ate it each day. I had read negative reviews about the breakfast, but we really enjoyed it! They had cereal, milk, different breads and pastries, orange juice, and coffee or cappuccino. Everything was delicious! Overall, it was a fine place to stay.

Reception was very friendly and helpful when we checked in and out.Rooms were lovely and warm the bed was comfy but be warned rooms are very basic. The only gripe i would have was that it was quite noisey early in the morning. and the breakfast wasn't the best so we skipped it and got coffee and danishes in the lovely little cafes in the area.

We faced the street and did not find the noise to be that disruptive - in fact, it was lovely as one evening, a strolling musician stopped at the restaurant below our window. We had free entertainment as we got ready for dinner. Our only complaint was a bit of noise from the adjoining rooms as those guests returned very late after a night of clubbing. We never took advantage of the free breakfast, but based on the comments from other guests there, it was apparently more than adequate.

As most things, it had its pro's and con's and we thought we\u00b4d list the most important ones, as well as give a few hints about Rome that we\u00b4d wanted to know before we got there.. Pros: The location was perfect, only 100m or so from the central railway station, Termini, which is the central station for both the metro lines and several buses as well. The rooms were clean and in good condition, the toilets and showers worked well. Everything was neat and tidy, the cleaning worked perfectly, and as a big plus, NO SMOKING in the rooms nor the hallways. We got a big(ger?) room with no number called the \"Privato\", and always got a wide smile when picking up the key at the reception. I tried to ask the staff if there was something special with this room, but apparently they didn\u00b4t understand my question too well as the answer was \" today? \". I decided to let it be. The staff was very friendly and things worked smoothly. Cons: The breakfast was not that good, packed croissants and breads, marmelade, juice and coffee. On the other hand, this seems to be the Italian standard. We made the mistake of ordering a breakfest elsewhere, and got the same thing..that wasn\u00b4t a 12 euro well spent. The room faced the street and got quite noisy at times. One night at 04.45 some morons (tourists, unnecessary to point out) decided it would be fun to play with a megaphone in the middle of the night / street. (Could happen at any hotel, can\u00b4t blame RomAntica for it) The staff managed the usual phrases in English, but I don\u00b4t think that a deeper conversation would have been possible. No minibar / fridge, and the AC was not turned on. (We didn\u00b4t ask for it to be turned on either, so I guess we only have ourselves to blame) Unrelated to the hotel, we\u00b4d like to give a few hints. - Take the red 110 sightseeing bus, the lines are long to get there, but there is a reason. The red buses are very frequent, 10mins in between, as most of the others have 1 hour. This is important if you hop off somewhere and intend to continue later. You dont want to realize that you've just missed a bus and have to wait for an hour for the next one. - The river boat. Take the river boat from Isola or at Ponte Sant' Angelo and go north and back. They only charge one single euro for a one way ticket (= total 2\u20ac) ! You don\u00b4t need any reservations or anything. This is the same boat that is included in the \"Bus'n boat\" tours offered by one of the bus companies. - Babbo's ristorante pizzeria (Via Cernaia 16/18, close to Porta Pia). The best one we could find! - The beach. Take the metro to Piramide (1\u20ac), and switch to a train to Lido di Ostia (1\u20ac), go to the end station and you are at the beach (entry 3\u20ac). The trip takes about 45mins. - The Vatican and the Sistine Chapel. If you intend to visit the Vatican museum and the Sistine Chapel, make sure you are there in good time before they open. We were there just before noon, and the lines were 1-1,5kms long ! ps. The metro tickets are valid for 75mins but only one ride.

So you're thinking of going to Rome; I hope you have a great time! I stayed at Hotel Romantica with my parents (triple room) from May 1 - 5, 2006.

It is very close to Termini, so if you get the bus/train from airport you don't have to walk far to the hotel. The staff do their job; they don't go too far out of their way to help you though, so if you're low maintenance you'll be fine. The map they give you will be your Bible for exploring Rome. There is a cheap supermarket nearby (at Santa Maria Maggiore, under the 'Upim' clothes store). The hotel is very well located for exploring Rome. 20 min walk to Colosseum; and many of the main attractions. (NB: I walked everywhere in Rome, and think I lost about 3 kgs in the process!!) There are loads of restaurants near the hotel; but don't order off the tourist menu - it's such a con! Usually food which has been pre-cooked hours beforehand and they just reheat it...it's awful. Don't fall for it like I did. Order off the real menu, and you will really enjoy the food!. PS: pizzas are so cheap and really nice, from 4\u20ac each!. Also great gelateria at Santa Maria Maggiore with good flavours. I recommend this hotel for anyone who is in Rome to explore. It is basic for those who only want somewhere to sleep. If you're not high maintenance you will be fine! PS, breakfast is nothing to write home about, it's all in little packets. Not worth the 8 \u20ac , however if it's included in the price, then you should take it. Highly recommend: a visit to Travastere, it is absolutely gorgeous, what you picture authentic residential Rome to look like. It really made us feel as though we had experienced Rome (as opposed to just seeing the tourist sights). Also for mega authentic gelato experience, go to Bar San Calisto (Piazza San Calisto); looks dodgy from the outside, doesn't even look like it does gelato. But they are hidden in metal containers, and amazingly cheap. Best gelato I tasted in Rome, better than the famous Gelataria della Palma (Via della Madelina) & Giolotti (Via Degli Uffici del Vicario) - from Roman Holiday around Pantheon. Yes, I had gelato every single day!! If you go on a hop on hop off bus, go on the '110 Rome' bus; it is very frequent (every 10 mins) so even though the lines might be long, it is well worth it, as opposed to waiting for the ones which come by once per hour.

The staff were friendly and helpfull, we have no reservations in recommending this hotel.", "Date": "November 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cgood comfortable hotel, problems with booking/receptionist\u201d", "Author": "lindsalba", "ReviewID": "UR4129867", "Content": "This was a nice clean spacious hotel, near to the station and not far from the sights.

Reception was efficient and good. Enjoyed our stay and found that this hotel was appropriate and good. There was a restaurant next door that was always filled at night-although we did not eat there.

The rooms are small and basic but spotlessly clean. There is a TV but there were no 'English' channels. The bathroom was again small but once again was clean. The bathroom was fitted with a hairdryer. The location of the hotel made it quite noisy and to combat this you required to shut the double glazing. However, depending on the temperature, you really need to use the Airconditioning. This is an extra to your room rate and they charge 10 Euros per night. Since the room rate is excellent value for Rome this was acceptable. Breakfast consisted of Cereal, Fruit juice, Croissants, Rolls and Tea/Coffee.
