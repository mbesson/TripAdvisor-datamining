We picked this hotel as part of a vacation package through Universal Orlando Vacations, that including flights, hotel stay, passes for the parks and a few other perks. The hotel was fairly well priced and its location was ideal since we did not want to pay the extra to stay within Universal itself. It was about a $5 cab ride to and from the park. It was also a $5-10 cab ride to the Premium Outlet Shops and within walking distance to several restaurants. The hotel was a distance from Disney and I would not recommend it for people planning to spend more than one day at Disney. They do offer a complimentary shuttle, but it takes at least an hour to go from hotel to park because it stops at about another dozen hotels along the way. If you want to skip the shuttle and take a cab, it costs about $45. The hotel was fresh and new and extremely clean. If I was staying for only one or two nights, I would have been very happy as I do not consider myself an overly picky traveler. However, we stayed for a week and I felt that this hotel was missing a few basic things that make a week-long stay a bit more comfortable: 1. The hotel did not have a proper restaurant. They served pub style food until 10:00pm around the pool bar. We went there one night after a very tiring day shopping. We waited over an hour for the food, the service was terrible, the food was expensive and when we received it, it was undercooked, cold and inedible. 2. There was no mirror in our room. We didn't notice on the first day but after a morning of three people trying to get ready at the same time, it became an issue. 3. There was no safe in our room. This really surprised us. My sis and I are fairly seasoned travelers and we've never stayed in a hotel in a touristy location that did not have a safe for passports, jewelry, valuables. 4. Breakfast was not included in the price and was very expensive compared to similar breakfasts in the area. The breakfast bar was set up in the lobby and, good or bad, as a result, the entire main level of the hotel smelled like bacon and sausage 24/7. 5. The front desk staff were not forthcoming with information about the area and what it had to offer. Finding out about transportation, places to eat, etc. was a bit of a chore. They did not have any kind of pamphlets or anything available for tourists. 6. The housekeeping service was TERRIBLE. While the hotel was very clean, they offered only 'light housekeeping duties' during your stay. What this meant was they changed the towels and made the beds. They did not restock the facial or bathroom tissue - we had to call the front desk for refills every time we ran out. We didn't get service at all on our first day - we had to call the front desk when we returned late in the evening to get fresh towels for the next morning. 7. None of the cab drivers seemed to know where our hotel was. I don't know if it recently changed names or what, but it became annoying to try to give the drivers directions when we didn't know the area at all. Overall, the hotel felt like an airport hotel or a one-nighter business hotel. It definitely didn't add anything positive to our Orlando vacation. I would not stay here again.", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "dekalb", "Title": "\u201cwonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "Weaselmcpuppy", "ReviewID": "UR128476288", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here April 18 & 19.

This is a good hotel for a family as it has a large kitchen in the rooms and a nice size family room/ extra bedroom. However the hotel staff was very unfriendly, all I require is to be courteous and to smile. They seemed burdened by my few questions. They had cleaned the carpets in the hallway and did not have any signs warning that the floor was slippery. Naturally I slipped. The smell of the chemicals was awful too. The king size bed and linens were nice. I want to say clean.... But I found a hair on a pillow. Not my hair. But still I liked the bedroom. The bathroom was large and clean and very nice, however, every night the toilet would randomly groan loud and wake me. It was strange and very annoying. As a result, I would never stay here again. Let's face it there are many hotels in orlAndo so why stay anywhere that you don't like. Lastly, the sliding glass door to the third floor balcony was broken and had no working lock. I wedged a garden chair in the track of the door to stop intruders. It was creepy at night. Enough said. And the breakfast was rubbery eggs.

My room was huge with a jetted tub, separate shower, and full kitchen. Any requests I made of the staff were immediately handled. Although I didn't get to enjoy the pool area, my room did overlook it and it looked quite nice. There are some quirks though. Because my room was low (3rd floor) I had a lot of noise from the pool until 11PM each night. After 11 it was very quiet but you may want to keep that in mind and ask for a higher floor if you sleep during the day. The wireless internet was only in the lobby, the rooms had wired internet. The business center cost $0.25/minute and $0.75 per printout to use the computer so it cost about $3 to print out my boarding pass. There is no shuttle service to the airport and a cab was $50 + tip. Expect a long walk to anywhere but Wet and Wild (although the I-Ride shuttle stops right in from of the hotel from 8AM - 10:30PM and a 5 day pass is only $8). There is a mandatory $11/night 'resort fee' so factor that into the price. The breakfast buffet was tasty but cost $12 which is a little steep. The pillows in my room were very squishy and uncomfortable but, in fairness, I didn't ask for new ones. On the positive side, my room was well stocked with dishes, glasses, and utensils and even has a Keurig for making coffee (additional K-cups are available from the front desk). My room was stylishly decorated and everything was in working order. Getting around on Universal and International Drive was easy from there by using the shuttle or even on foot if you're fit.

For eating out I would recommend TGI Fridays which is within sight of the hotel and Outback Steakhouse which is not! Cabana bar food a bit overpriced and not that tasty. Handy if you are happy enough to stay by the pool and enjoy the pleasant ambience there. Sun loungers and towels are free and plentiful. There is also a jacuzzi and a fitness suite but I was not tempted to use it! I would say if you are going to Disney parks then hire a car. I had never driven on the right before this holiday but soon got used to it. The cars was an automatic and the roads are well signed and American drivers very courteous.

Please see my previous reviews for greater detail of the orlando area if needed. This was a very last minute Easter Break and, to be honest, there was not an awful lot of choice left (that stood out) on the conventional hotel websites (hotels.com, etc) so, I noticed The Point was available. I booked it directly on the hotels website in $USD. Its location is great. A quater of a mile in each direction, out of the gate, you have either Sand Lake Road, with its easy access to International Drive, north and south and I4 (Disney) or Wet and Wild and just further along, Universal. As always, I would suggest you dont consider most properties without a car. For old times sake, we decided to take the hotel shuttle to EPCOT (it only goes there) and leave the car. Errrr, dont miss doing that. The bus had seen better days and stopped at about six other properties before hitting I4. On the way back (6PM) the bus was way overcrowded and some people didnt get on. what did they do?. Dont know?. I had to stand for 45 minutes, which wasnt much fun. However, this wasnt the Hotels Fault. The staff are very friendly and helpful and nothing seemed too much trouble. To settle in for two weeks we needed extra things and this was taken care of quickly and with a polite smile. The Hotel has a Nice Pool and Cabana Bar, which is very resonably priced and the food surprisingly good. We had a One Bedroom Executive Suite, so, seperate bedroom with King Sized Bed, a great mini kitchen and really good family sized bathroom. Everything was clean and tidy. This is a general observation, and not a criticism of the hotel, but we have two teenage girls and we had never stayed anywhere without another bedroom before. With the Gift of Hindsight, I probably would only consider a two bed unit, not just here, but anywhere. I thought we might be able to get away with the sofa bed, but, it was cramped and uncomfortable for the girls with a really skinny mattress. Angela from the Hotel Reception organised a second mattress which made it \"just\" acceptable for the two weeks stay. So, my recommendation would be that sofa beds for a family of 4 are only really suitable for a couple of kids, say up to 10 or 1 child only. Older than that, I believe they need their own beds. The Point is a very good choice for those visiting orlando for the first time and experienced travellers and therefore I would not hesitate to recommend it or consider it again next time.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place to stay\u201d", "Author": "ViliH", "ReviewID": "UR128236462", "Content": "The Point Resort is a great place to stay at in Orlando.

Pros include cleanliness of room, full kitchen, large bath with a one-person jetted tub, towels at the pool, and being on the I drive Trolley route. The cons included non-disclosed fees, on-site food, advertised shuttle, management communication. I booked this trip through SouthWest vacations looking for a good quality hotel close to Universal for the $. I was looking in the 4-star category. In Orlando there are a lot of nice hotels and heavy competition for the tourist $ with prices being very competitive. The stay was in the OK to Good range. Nothing really special but it was nice. It wasn't very busy. 1-5 in pool or at outside bar/grill. Upon check-in this hotel required a $75 deposit for \"incidentals\" which some hotels do...No problem but no additional fees discussed. Standard check-in process. We had breakfast for two at the hotel which was $22. I felt it was a little expensive for a small spread and had to pay for coffee separate but not a huge deal. The advertised free shuttle only ran once per day in each direction leaving at 7:45AM and pick up was scheduled 1.5 hours after the park closed which was 7:30PM. No other options for free...ended up taking a cab($10). My surprise came at check-out when I expected to pay that $22 for breakfast and found my room tab was the breakfast plus $39 additional in RESORT FEES. $13 / day that wasn't disclosed to me up front / during the booking process on Southwest / or anytime. I asked what the $13 paid for and was told it was a fee always charged. I asked why they don't include it in the price they advertise and was met with blank stares. I needed to leave for the airport so I decided I would call management upon my return home. I did 3 times and was transferred to a management company (no manager on site?) and each time my call wasn't returned. I would not recommend staying here based off these underhanded business practices.

Place in in shopping center, on front corner, of left side about a 1/3 mile down. Right at the light. Looks and feels like a Denny's type place. We at breakfast buffet at place right across from Wet-n-Wild entrance. Too pricey when you add juice, coffee and such. We walked to Universal. I would easily do this again and again. It is a mile or so with all sidewalks. Keep in mind, the cab ride to airport is around $40 each way and that was easily cheaper than a car that stays parked at Universal all day. Wet-n-wild ? Go after 3pm, its half day rate. We also did the sky-diving simulator (yes we easily walk to it).

She was very friendly and managed to get us into a room about 1.5 hours before our supposed check-in time. Upon entering the room, a One-Bedroom Grand Suite, I was pleasantly surprised. For once, it looked just as it appeared on the hotel website's photo gallery. The room was very clean, and very nicely furnished. The kitchen was fully stocked (plates, utensils, blender, toaster, full-size fridge, stove, etc.). There is a common area with a pull-out couch and television, a balcony, a master bedroom (with a king-size bed and a TV). The bathroom has a tub as well as a shower, and separate entrances for the master bedroom and common areas. The room itself was very spacious. It could easily sleep 4 comfortably. Also located in the One-Bedroom Grand Suite was a washer/dryer. The resort itself was well maintained. Everything was clean, and the staff was very courteous. The pool area took me by surprise. Not only does the pool look brand new, but it's accompanied by a poolside bar/grille..which was fantastic! If you don't have a car, you'll need to take a shuttle or taxi to get to the theme parks (if that's where you're heading). The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to the parks (the downside being it only travels once in the morning and once at night). However, if you do have a car.. it's about a 5 minute drive to Universal Orlando, and a 15 minute drive to Disney World. I actually really enjoyed the location of the hotel. It's a couple blocks off International Drive, making it close to many attractions but also quiet so you can end your day with some needed peace, quietness, rest, and relaxation. I would recommend this hotel to a friend. You definitely get a good bang for your buck. Fabio was also very professional and friendly when it was time to check-out.

Just be aware that the kitchen in the studio is only a microwave and a small refrigerator so hard to make a true meal. Kitchen was very minimally equipped - two glasses, two mugs etc. We were there for five nights. I think that warrants the room being cleaned once during that time. Many days came back at 4, after having been gone from 8 am, and bed had not been made nor towels refreshed. Also wish they had ice machines on floors. Find it an inconvenience to have to go to front desk to have someone go get you ice and didn't feel right to call to have ice brought up. Also agree with other reviewers that in this day and age there should be wifi in rooms. Many people in lobby and pool area using their ipads, etc. Pool area was pleasant, without any bells and whistles, but not a problem to find a lounge or seating. The exercise room was rather basic, lacking a television, mats, weights, but also did not seem to be in big demand. Parking is crowded and many spaces a bit of a hike from the front door.

We had a grand one bedroom suite, which was very affordable because of a special sale they were having...got a great deal through Travelocity. I may not have found this hotel otherwise. Overall, very nice hotel with wonderful staff - would definitely stay again. The hotel is clean, and the rooms (especially the suites) are wonderful. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Some strong points: - the staff: friendly, always willing to help, most will go out of their way to help you. Bell staff is particularly excellent. - the rooms: large, with full kitchen and washer/dryer, iron and ironing board. This is a great way to save money and since you can do a load or two of laundry while there, you can pack less clothes. All have central air AND ceiling fans. Ask for a room with a pool view, which is nicer than the parking lot/lagoon view. - the free breakfast: not just continental; they have eggs, bacon, pancakes, etc. Standard fare and nothing special, but the breakfast here is much better than a number of other hotels which only offer muffins and pastries and such. The one odd thing that needs to be mentioned - coffee isn't included. Brew your coffee in your room and bring it with you if you don't want to pay. - the pool area: piped-in music, which helps drown out some of the traffic noise from Carrier Drive, which runs behind the hotel. Nice bistro, great for a lunch or late-afternoon snack, open from just before lunch until 10:00 at night. - the free shuttle to major theme parks. But it's not all \"good\" news for the shuttle, I'm afraid. See warnings below. - room \"supplies\": the hotel provides paper towels, a dish sponge and some small size packages of laundry detergent and dishwashing liquid. Enough for one load of laundry and a week's worth of dishes. The 1 and 2 bedroom suites also have a dishwasher, but no dishwasher detergent is provided. So if you plan to use the dishwasher, bring your own supply of dishwasher detergent. We did the dishes by hand using the provided dishwashing liquid, and we used the dishwasher as a drying rack - perfect solution. Also, no fabric softener or dryer sheets are available, so remember to bring some from home if you plan on doing a load of laundry and don't want your clothes to be stiff and scratchy. Some less than perfect points: - the location: yes, it's a few minutes from Universal, but since they have a shuttle, so what? There's not much within walking distance. There's a Walgreen's about a 15 min walk away, but that's pretty much it. Unless you have a car, be ready to spend major bucks on taxicabs. Remember, you have a full kitchen and you'll want some groceries...but there is no supermarket anywhere close. If you don't have a car, expect to pay $30 round trip to get to the nearest Publix by taxicab. - lack of front desk staff: during the entire week I was there, there was only one staff member manning the front desk at a time. During peak arrival/departure and shuttle departure hours, this resulted in a long line at the front desk. Only once did I see two employees at the front desk at the same time. The Point needs to fix this if they don't want angry guests on their hands...I saw many people starting to lose their patience while I was having breakfast - the breakfast area is right across from the front desk area. - the \"extra\" charges: maid service is limited to a \"room refresh\" only. This means making the bed, providing fresh towels and supplies (toilet paper, kleenex, etc.) and taking out the trash. Nothing and I mean NOTHING else. Leave an empty kleenex box on the floor beside the bed, and it'll still be there when you come back. Anything beyond the room refresh will cost you $15 a pop. The hotel doesn't provide a broom/dustpan in the room, and they should if they aren't going to clean the rooms daily. - the \"resort\" fee: about $11 per day...for what I'm not sure since they don't clean the rooms and don't have free wi-fi in the rooms (more about that in a minute). Perhaps to cover the \"free\" breakfast? If that's the case, then the breakfast isn't really free, is it? - the \"pay\" business center: this is no longer the norm for most hotels - most provide free wi-fi everywhere in the hotel or at least have a business centre that can be used free of charge. Not so at The Point. Want to reserve some Disney tickets online? It'll cost you $0.25 per minute to use a computer, and $0.75 per page to print out the confirmation. This is 2012, and charging for these services is unreasonable. This isn't some budget motel, it's a four-star resort. The hotel does have free wi-fi available, but only in the pool area and in the lobby. Next time I'll bring my laptop - didn't think I had to for a vacation, but it's a MUST at The Point if you want to research restaurants and attractions or buy tickets online. - the free shuttle to major theme parks: for Universal, it's great as you're the first to get off. For Disney, not so much. You will be taken on a tour of a large number of hotels on the way, and expect the trip to take well over an hour. On the plus side, you will get a seat since you're the first to get on, but the shuttle will be crowded and standing room only by the time you're done picking people up. Also, there's only ONE shuttle per day for Universal and Sea World - one departure and one pick up. Miss it or want to come back early? You'll have to find your own way back to the hotel. Best way from Universal is to cab it as it's pretty close. With fare & tip, this will cost you about $20. There are three departure and pick up times for Disney, which is much better. And that's a good thing, because a taxicab from Disney to The Point will cost you at least $60 - $75, depending on the traffic. Be sure to plan your day around the shuttle times if you don't have a car. All in all, a great stay and would definitely stay again. As mentioned above, there are a number of things that could be improved, but these are all minor and not enough to prevent me from returning. I felt it was important to mention these little irritants, if only to help prepare other folks heading to The Point. One final word of advice...bring your own hairdryer. The hairdryer provided by the hotel just doesn't cut it. I could have dried my hair faster by sitting in front of a fan or asking my daughter to blow on it.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Vacation!

We were in a one bedroom suite. It was perfect. It had full kitchen for making snacks and holding groceries we bought at local grocery store. we are on health kick, so fruits and veggies to snack on was important for us. they had a mixer in the kithcen so we could make our own fresh smoothies every morning. The bathroom was nice with seperate showere and jetted tub. perfect way to relax after full day of hitting the parks. The bed was very comfortable and there were extra pillows and blankets for us. Ther ewas a tv in the bedroom as well as living room, for watching movie together too. The washer and dryer was nice as well in the room. we were able to take all our clothes home clean versus having laundry to do after we got bac kfrom our trip. The hotel- Was perfect for hanging out at. the pool/hot tub were nice for hanging out in the morning to catchsome sun, and the hot tub was great for relaxing in th evening. There was a bar/grill area by the pool that served great snacks and bar food. was great for light meal or snacking for lunch or dinner. The workout room was great and had all the equipment we needed to keep to our routine while on our trip. The breakfast area- This area was a little small, and since hotel was fully booked the weekend we were there, it was crowded wiht not enough seats. No problem for us, as we just took the food back up to our room when we got something from down there. they serve Starbucks coffee for you coffe lovers. I recommend getting a break fast plan if you are going to eat at hotel, versus paying the $11 or 12 a person in the monring every time you came down. If not interested in that, IHOP and Dennys are within 2 miles of the hotel. Location- It is literally 5 minuts or less from Universal Studios, so very convenient, if visiting that park. IF you are going to use the complimentary shuttle, please be aware that they only pick up and drop off once a day, so you need to sign up for this wiht front desk. I think people think that shuttles run consistently all day and were disappointed when they found out otherwise. For the price you pay for this place, I htink them offering the shuttle once a day is more than fair. they do have to make some money or they wont be around for long. Overall, this resort is awesome and I think priced low for the value of the room, amenities and location for the area. I would saty here sooner versus later, beacuse these prices will go up once more people know about this place.

The resort feels new and in very good condition. The rooms are all suites and are in very good condition. They are not opulent but are well furnished. I would watch the reviews over the next 5-10 years to make sure they are maintained properly, as the finish-out appears to be cheap and not durable. Our suite had a full kitchen which would be great for families on a budget. There were utensils and everything you would need to cook a full meal. There was also a stacker type washer/dryer with a small box of detergent. During our entire stay, I never heard a sound outside of our room. Nothing from next door our in the hallway. That's unusual in my experience, and welcome. The view from our room was not great. We faced East. We overlooked an auto repair shop, a vacant field and as far as the eye could see, vegetation and brush. it had a very industrial feel to it. Try to get a room facing the pool area if you can. There is very limited dining in this hotel. They serve virtually the same breakfast daily, for $9.95 per person plus coffee. The first day, it seemed pretty good. The second day of over-cooked egg curds and baked bacon was not pleasant. The third day we hiked about a mile to Denny's (yes it was that bad). There is a limited menu outside at the pool bar for lunch and dinner, and a full bar there too. The pool area was nice and well maintained. The service there was pretty good, but you have to go to the bar to get service, as there is no waitstaff to serve you at the pool. You will need a car or a taxi to go anywhere you want to go. Be careful to ask for a town car or a licensed cab. We unintentionally got into an unlicensed cab and that was a mistake. The driver didn't know where our restaurant was and we ended up having to use our phones to navigate for him. Overall, for the price and the space, this was a great bargain. If you \"have stayed there before\" you can get a discounted room rate. There is no requirement to prove when you stayed there, but if you mention that fact it works.

We booked 4 rooms for all of us and most everything was perfect! Check in was a breeze and the rooms were very roomy and clean! We especially loved the washer and dryer in the rooms! We didn't eat the breakfast offered because it was $10 a person and they really didn't have much to offer. The pool area is wonderful and has very nice and clean restrooms and plenty of towels for use. My only complaints were I wouldn't recommend eating at the cabana bar unless you don't mind waiting an hour for your food! VERY slow service!!! The food is very good though so as long as you don't mind the wait... it is tasty! One evening my Aunt ordered a hamburger and it was served on regular bread. When she asked about it, he told her they ran out of buns so deal with it. She was a bit annoyed about that! They should have asked her if it would be ok to put her burger on bread first! They allow you to drink your own liquor outside at the pool so if you want to save some money you can always bring your own and sit at a table! Also I had reserved 2 of the rooms on my credit card (just to hold them) and when we arrived my parents changed the credit card info on one of the rooms to their card and yet when they checked out the room it still got charged to my credit card. When they did the reversal, I somehow got screwed out of $30. When I brought this to their attention they would not do anything for me even though the mistake was theirs in the first place. The room should have NEVER been charged to my credit card in the first place! Also if you like housekeeping at a hotel, this is not the place for you! They come daily to make your bed and give you towels - that's it. That would have been fine enough for me anyways but everyday I had to call for extra towels because she only ever left me 3 towels and there were 4 of us in the room???? After the first 2 days you'd think she'd get the hint...but never did! If you like having your coffee every morning like I do, bring extra Keurig cups. They give you 3 to start and after that they are $1 each at the front desk. No big deal for me as I brought extras. I'm giving sleep quality a 4 only because the pillows they have are brutal! But the beds were excellent! We stayed twice in the 2 weeks (before and after our cruise) and before we left the first time we had arranged what rooms we were to be in so we'd be together and yet when we returned they had given our rooms away so I though that was distasteful of them. They did get us into other rooms we were happy with but I just feel for the amount of money we dropped over 8 nights x 4, they shouldn't have done that! When we checked out, my ride I had arranged failed to show and the man at the front desk quickly got us alternate transportation so that was very nice! Overall I would highly recommend this hotel for the comfort and price! Was a great stay beside the few glitches.

The location is very quiet. We had a spacious studio room on the ground floor, with a view of the car park from our window, but the quality of the room more than made up for it. The room was well presented, tastefully decorated and very clean. There is a full-size fridge, microwave, coffee maker, iron & board, tea-towel and cloths. The crockery and cutlery were immaculate and there was a selection of glasses. Even a bottle and tin opener. There was no kettle or toaster. The air-con was extremely quiet, we didn't even notice it was on. The bed was comfortable which gave us a good nights sleep. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast is available in the lobby, which we tried on the first morning, and cost $25 for two. Because of the variety of eateries in Orlando we ate out for the rest of the holiday. There are restaurants for every taste around the I.Drive area, and also a Publix supermarket at Stop 41 on the I-Trolley route. The resort is located on the intersection of Universal Blvd and Carrier Drive, one block from I. Drive. It took around ten minutes to walk along Carrier Drive to I.Drive. Getting around couldn't be easier - just hop on the I-Trolley (Green Stop G6) outside the resort and you can get anywhere along the main tourist route. Single fare $1.25 or Senior 0.25c. Exact fare is required. We purchased an Unlimited Ride Pass for seven days cost $10. Once we understood the Green and Red routes we hopped on and hopped off allday. A useful booklet to have is the International Drive Official Visitors Guide, it lists everything you need to know. To travel further than the I.Drive area, pop into the Official Visitor Center on Austrian Court (Red Stop 20) and pick-up Lynx schedules, which give information on all routes further afield. Again, you need exact fare, usually $2 adult/$1 Senior. Our journey required us to change buses so we asked for a \"Transfer\" ticket on the first bus and we used it for both buses.

The quality of the furnishings was much better than your basic mid-range hotel rooms. The pool area was always clean and inviting, and the front desk staff was top notch. We dealt with Fabio and Angela (the manager), and they couldn't have done more for us. When we reached Fort Myers, we checked into a Best Western for our stay there. After getting into our room, we directly called back to the Point and asked them to add 3 more nights to our reservation, because the Best Western Hotel was, in our minds, sub-standard, old, and not kept up. We stayed there 2 nights, and headed back to Orlando where we were greeted by Fabio, and our room was upgraded to a beautiful 1 bedroom suite, for all nights, at no extra charge. Apparently, returning guests get an upgrade. The 1 bedroom suite has all the amenities of home, full size fridge, range, dishwasher and even washer and dryer.

Room: We booked a one bed apartment, and requested a pool view on an upper floor which we got. The apartment was very well equipped for a self catering holiday. The kitchen had a full cooker and over, large fridge freezer, dishwasher (the hotel provide detergent), washing machine & dryer, coffee machine and sink (the hotel provide a cloth & washing up liquid). The hotel also provide kitchen paper and toilet paper! The bedroom was large with a large bed, TV and plenty of storage space. The bathroom was bit with a Jacuzzi bath and walk in shower, it also had storage and a large vanity area around the wash hand basin (this is the only mirror in the apartment). The living room had a TV, dining table with 4 chairs, storage and a two seater couch. There was a small balcony with 2 chairs which came in handy for drying clothes. The apartment was spotless, and we had the bins emptied and new towels provided every day. The hotel itself is also very clean. We were on a room only rate so didn\u2019t have the breakfast but did use the coffee shop! There is a \u2018cabana bar\u2019 out by the pool which serves drink and basic bar food \u2013 not the best but OK if there is nothing else available or its late. The pool was very clean and there were plenty sun loungers and pool towels are provided on a \u2018help yourself\u2019 basis. Tip: Before we arrived I ordered groceries from Garden Grocer online. These arrived before we did and were delivered to our apartment! Great for the heavy things like water, soft drinks etc! Hotel Shuttle: The hotel provides daily shuttles to Disney, Sea World and Universal. The Disney shuttle took about 1 hour and the only drawback was the return times were not very good. The Sea World shuttle also took an hour which was long considering how near the hotel it to it \u2013 you would be better of using the I RIDE trolley. We didn\u2019t use the Universal shuttle as it is only about a 25 min walk to Universal which was nice in the morning. There is sidewalk all the way to Universal but you do have to cross a few busy roads. We also walked back at night and it seemed safe enough. Location: The hotel is less than 5 mins walk from Wet n Wild and International Drive so it could not be better. It is away from the main road so nice and peaceful if staying by the pool for the day. There are shops nearby and a lovey Deli call \u2018Green Tomatoes\u2019 which does lovely salads, breads, pastas etc \u2013 a lovely alternative to fast food! There are a few crazy golf places within a 5 minute walk and the I-RIDE stop to go up and down I Drive is also close by. Would I stay there again?

Unfortunately I was disappointed in my overall experience. My husband and I were going to Orlando for a getaway - just the two of us, no kids. The hotel was originally a condo building but the builder could no longer make the payments so another ownership group came in and turned it into a hotel - at least that is what I was told by the staff when I inquired. So the rooms are accommodating - they offer a full kitchen and a small washer and dryer which would be great for longer visits. We were only there for 3 days so we didn't use these amenities that much. This would be ideal for someone staying in Orlando for over a week with kids though. Furthermore, the atmosphere at the \"hotel\" was very dead. Although it is very close to Universal it is not within walking distance and the hotel does not have a real restaurant so there is no reason that someone that wasn't staying there would come to the hotel. They do have a pool and a pool \"bar\" but there are very few people there and the bar is extremely overpriced. There is no room service either. There is a small cafe but when I requested a breakfast sandwich I was told that they could not accommodate my request. So, there isn't anything to do at the hotel besides swim in the pool BUT they do not provide quick shuttle service multiple times during the day to any of the parks including Universal which is very close to the hotel. They do have a shuttle that comes once in the morning to pick you up and take you to the parks - it is free - but the one time we tried to use it the shuttle was over 30 minutes late and we decided to take a cab because we wanted to get to the parks - that cost $50. We went to City Walk at Universal each night and also had to take a cab there - $10 each way. For what I ended up spending in cab fare the discounted rate on the hotel was not really worth it. Overall, the atmosphere and amenities of the hotel were not suited for a couple taking a vacation and would be more suited to families who put more emphasis on the kitchen and laundry room. As someone who frequents Universal often I was very disappointed and can say confidently that there are much better places to stay. The biggest disappointment for me was that this is a \"Universal Family Hotel\" and they don't provide regular transportation to Universal - which their website would lead you to believe. Worst of all, my husband got very sick on our last day (I guess that just topped off the lackluster vacation experience) and I asked if I could get some kind of credit for my last night there since we had to check out early but I was told no, even though we left before noon. I expect more from hotels with the \"Universal Family\" brand and would not recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a fun destination with plenty of things to do.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cNice suite for family to stay\u201d", "Author": "ZHEN Q", "ReviewID": "UR122426971", "Content": "Just came back from Orlando.

Loads of cuttlery and crockery. Dishwasher, dryer, washing machine (put this on when you're going out and not late at night as they are very noisey), juicer and coffee making machine. Washing up liquid/powder and detergant are replace daily along with the towels, shamoo ad soap. The apartment had two tvs with a great selection of channels and a balcony. When you make your reservation you can also give your floor and view preferance which is a nice touch. The staff here are friendly, efficient and accomodating and all staff from accommodation to reception greeted you and smiled when you passed them.

The laundry machine came in handy and the hotel gladly replenished the detergent several times over. It was a 20 minute walk to Universal Studios so we walked in the morning and took a cab on the way back. The hotel could do better with having more frequent shuttles to/from Universal Studios. On our morning walks we spotted a few more hotels closer to the theme parks so if you mind walking 20 minutes do look around! For the most part the hotel staff was friendly. The resort fee though a bit high does help if you plan on parking a car. With smartphones and hardly much of the day spent in your room you probably wouldnt need to use the phone or internet much.

All the staff were very nice ,decent and seemed pleased to help you our only faults with the hotel were no bidet in bathroom, Dressing robes should be provided for the first 2 floors as they overlook both car park and swimming pool and you cannot open your curtain fully as people could see into your room, Also the hotel states that your room is fully serviced twice during your stay, However this includes the room being clean when you arrive which you would expect then a full clean half way through, A clean room to start then 2 full cleans during stay would be better, Coffee machine provided with weak coffee and no tea.

To be fair, after the second night we spoke to the front desk and the guy offered us to bring another matress or to try a different room. We agreed to try a bed in a different room but unfortunatelly we soon found out that all the matrasses were the same. First we thought it might be us but we didn't have this problem anywhere else we stayed during this holiday on Florida- Holiday Inn nor Hilton. 2. Plastic cutlery at the breakfast- Yes, I am serious!! And the breakfast doesnt look anything like the one advertised in the lift, huge dissapointment. 3. No SAFE in the room. Usually you have a place where you can put your valuables. Our room didn't have any. I looked everywhere, so did my husband and no mention of this servvice in the booklet either. 4. They offer a shuttle service to the parks. It's 1 shuttle per day to each park. So you have to go at 9:30 or other similar times to certain parks. If you want to have a longer sleep you have to find your own way. And I noticed they are picking you up almost 1 hour after the closing time. What are you supposed to do if you had enough at 3pm? Just sit and wait until 7pm?No thanks! We didn't want to feel restricted, so we drove our car and paid an extra for the parking at the theme park (yes, that is sad too, those expensive tickets dont include parking). Overall, nicely presented hotel, with hard working staff but lack of quality (bed, pillows, breakfast and plastic cutlery) brings it down.

Disney is about 20-25 minutes drive by car, but easy to find. Hotelroom entrace is somewhat funky; you share an entrance door with your neighbours. In the small hall, there is a second entrance to your own room. One night, our neighbours locked the first door by accident from the inside. Since we came in pretty late, they had to be woken up by staff by telephone. They should be able to remove the fixed lock on this first door to avoid these kind of mistakes; given the reaction of the staff when I approach reception, this lockout happens quite frequently. The hotel charges a resort fee, and you can upgrade to full maid service. Be sure to know if you need this; their information is a bit flaky on what to expect within the normal resort fee; towels are changed, although they don't state it like that. Read between the lines or ask clarification before deciding which level of service you need. The internet connection in the room is wired; wireless is available in the lobby and around the pool, it is free and I never experienced a problem with it. I didn't ease breakfast at the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. The gym is tiny, but features all necesarry equipment and I usually was alone in the gym.

The manager said no problem we can go ahead and do that for you. As you can imagine, when we got to the hotel they were magically filled to 98% capacity. The hotel never seemed to be packed with people at any point. Even at breakfast the next morning we only saw about 5 people eating breakfast. Our room was small and shared a small foyer or hallway with another room so when your neighbor comes in and out of their room you hear everything. The laundry room used by the cleaning ladies was at the end of my hall so all night long I heard what sounded like a helicoptor out side my window for 45 minutes was my guess to be the dryer going all night long. My wife and I also didn't like the area at all. It seemed runned down and of a low class. Area was also very very busy and tough to get around in. Traffic was horrible so waiting for the trollies was quite a wait somtimes. One of the reasons we booked our stay at The Point was their close proximity to Universal Studios which they offer a free shuttle to. Well their free shuttle only drops you off and picks you up early before the park opens and then well after the park closes. So in the morning you have to wait an hour and a half for the park to open and then, assuming you want to stay the whole 9 hours the park is open, you have to wait an hour and half after the park closes to be picked up. What good is that?! We canceled the rest of our stay at the Point and went back to the Buena Vista Palace located inside disney.

What first impressed us when we walked in was how clean the suite was. It was very well equipped with everything you would wish for in a SC apartment....large cooker with oven, microwave, enormous fridge/freezer, dishwasher, washing machine and dryer, kettle, coffee maker, blender/liquidiser, cutlery, china, etc. Other things provided were packets of coffee for the coffee maker, small bottle of washing up liquid, small boxes of washing powder and dishwasher detergtent, washing up sponge and kitchen paper. The dining area/lounge is a good size and has a flat screen tv. The bedroom also has a tv, clock radio, lots of drawer space, a good size wardrobe, and most importantly being a bad back sufferer, a really comfy bed. The air conditioning works well + you also have ceiling fans over the bed and in the lounge area. The bathroom has more cupboard space, a fantastic walk-in shower (which was very powerful) and the toilet has a door to separate it from the bathroom.

They always had a cheerful smile and greeting for you whenever they saw you. One morning we used the free shuttle bus to Universal which left at 8.15 with about 15 of us from the resort. We were the only ones on-board and didn't stop to pick others up - we were in IoA by 8.30 (not sure if this would be the case during other months). We didn't hire a car, so used the Lynx buses and cabs. A cab from Orlando Airport was approx $38, from Mall of Millenia $15, Walmart at S John Parkway $12. It took us about 10 mins to walk to I-Drive and where Wet 'n' Wild is. The only thing I would have liked is a room safe - maybe these will be fitted in the near future.

Originally, this was built to be a condo complex NOT a hotel, and it showed. We had not even arrived yet when I knew something was off. I was expecting at least some acreage, nice landscaping, as such, but it was a standard turn onto a road that led to a parking lot. It was a very typical set-up, no different than a Marriott Courtyard. As we proceeded with check-in and got settled, these were our observations: -No doorman, bell hop, or any staff around to greet us. Which meant no help with our luggage and no self serve carts in sight. -Check in was quick as there was no one else and we did experience some minor hiccups which resulted in a change of rooms. -Lobby was nice, small and unassuming. Again, something reminiscent of a mid-value chain hotel. There was no concierge, no room service and no valet parking. Since the only entrance to the hotel was through the lobby, it was often a long walk to our parked car. -The interior was clean yet unremarkable. The one bedroom suite was decent, but we have stayed at Hilton's Homewood Suites or Marriott's Residence Inns that were nicer. Kitchen was well stocked and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was very large and had a separate bath/shower. There was ample storage, since again, this was supposed to be a condo, designed for longer stays. Let's just say, I was expecting something different as we were kind of treating ourselves to a last minute get away during a difficult time. I guess I was envisioning some pampering but it was definitely a do it yourself kind of place. -Minimal housekeeping. Beds were made, towels changed and trash removed. That is it. Dirty cups remained, toiletries were not replenished, carpet not vacuumed, counters not cleaned, etc. No big deal, but again, my expectations from their advertising led me to believe I would have a much different experience. -Resort fee. When I was quoted this added expensive, I didn't think much of it as most resorts have this. I was told amongst other things, that this is to offset things like free shuttles to Universal. I was pleased with that, as parking costs $15. When we inquired about the shuttle, we were told it leaves at 8:15 AM and picks up at around 7:00 PM . Nothing in between. Well, we drove ourselves. -Breakfast. We were able to secure a AAA rate that included breakfast, otherwise I would have not paid the $9-$10 they charged. There were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cereals, breads, coffee, tea, and juices. Yogurt was from large tubs, that just didn't look appealing. The food was completely unremarkable and we even skipped it one morning even though we had a voucher for a free meal. Some of the good points about this property included the pool area, in suite washer/dryer, small balcony, and a very cordial and helpful assistant manager. Again, had I signed up for a Residence Inn, I would have rated this a \"Very Good\", but I thought I booked a full service resort.

And worse of all is the fact that the bar closes at 11pm. The bar food we bought(kids chicken and chips) was fine the rest of the menu didnt inspire me at all. The breakfast buffet looked and smelled bad so we stayed away and the so called starbucks is 2 pots of brewed coffee with starbucks stickers on them.

It is within walking distance of the huge Wet and Wild waterpark and is also close to quite a few restaurants including T.G.I. Fridays, Pizza Hut, Buffalo Wild Wings and other burger joints and privately owned family style restaurants. We chose a king suite which for lack of a better term was a \"one bedroom apartment\" and included king size bet, huge bathroom with whirlpool tub, large tile shower and seperate water closet, full size fridge, microwave, stove and cooktop, blender, toaster, washer and dryer, and icemaker in the fridge. There was ample silverware, plates, bowls, glasses and coffee cups, oh, and a coffee maker of course. There was a couch in the living area that folded to a bed and a four chair dining table. Housekeeping included touch up cleaning which was making the bed everyday, clean towels and very minor cleaning if needed. We never saw the cleaning crew in our room the entire length of our stay. They were very fast and effecient. The view from our balcony was a nice view of the pool area and the size was nice. This an incredible place to stay for the price that we paid. I have paid more for a single hotel room in less desireable locations. HUGE bang for the buck!!!!!!! I almost feel guilty for pointing out a couple of drawbacks but I feel that I must for the sake of prudence. Just be mindful that these things would by no means keep me from going back in the future but I think could easily be improved. First, the fitness center is...... well, just bad. It consisted of two treadmills, and ellipitical machine and a broken \"weight machine\". It did include towels and a water cooler though. The breakfast, which buy the way, was included in our package deal but the staff at the front desk forgot to give us our vouchers at check in, was... well..... not very good at all. The regular price was about 10 bucks and included coffee, oatmeal, scrambled eggs and egg whites, cereal, yogurt,bagels and bread for toast. If you requested them you could also have fruit and microwave pancakes or french toast. There were also a couple of different juices that were usually watered down because of the ice melting and that was about it. I was very disappointed because with just a few additions this could be a great breakfast but it just wasn't. I actually ate fruit and yogurt every morning for breakfast. Internet service is a little bit of a challenge in that that the only wireless is in the lobby and it is hardwired in the rooms. We asked if we could print an email at the front desk and were told that the business center was operated independently and charged for usage. There were one or two small things that were just slightly annoying but nothing major at all. The bar that is at the pool is fantastic and the bartenders are pretty fun. A little advice about location. If you are planning on going to the major theme parks, the outlet malls, better restaurants, ect. Go ahead and rent a car and pick it up at the airport. Our cab ride to the hotel was approximately 70 bucks. The rental car for the rest of the trip was only 300 bucks. You cant take your chances with the shuttles to the theme parks but they leave at a certian time and return at a certian time. Waiting is just part of the free ride. The staff at this resort is very pleasn't and accomidating. My friend dropped a wine bottle on the floor while we were there and the stafff was up immediately and cleaned up the mess. It was a great trip and I would love to stay at this resort again.

Some people might complain at the resort fee which you are charged for parking and high-speed internet in the rooms but at $9 a day it's really not that bad considering you don't even get any of that at other Orlando hotels.

We were located on the fifth floor overlooking the pool which was excellent. I cannot praise the accommodation enough, the kitchen was well equipped, we had a spacious living area and balcony off it. Our bedroom was perfect with a large bathroom. Our daughters room was perfect and was in fact a self contained suite, the design of the two bedded suites mean you enter through one door from the hall, but inside there are two separate doors, one side has the kitchen, living and master bedroom with large bathroom and the other, with its own separate entrance, had a double bedroom with a living area with kitchenette and bathroom. The layout is excellent where family members want to be together, but at the same time have their own space. The pool, which we used every morning, was a great size and never really that busy which was very pleasant. There are multiple seating areas and plenty of beach size towels available and a hot tub, and small gym. The cabana (located near the pool) is very handy for drinks, though they are expensive, and if you get peckish they serve a nice selection of food. The location is amazing, we were not far from any place, sea world and universal is close by and Disney only a short drive, shopping of course is just wonderful and the malls seem to stay open late most evenings, Florida Mall, International Drive outlet mall, and many others all just a short drive away. We loved the peace at the hotel we never heard anyone else in the other suites, which was terrific. The internet access in the rooms was very helpful for looking up addresses of places to visit and then enter them into the sat. navigation. The staff were the absolute best, I could not fault them at all, from the moment we entered the hotel, they helped with everything and were always on hand in the background if we needed anything. A lovely lady in reception (on our last night) printed our boarding passes, nothing was too much trouble. The cleaning staff were great, always remembering to replace little things, like kitchen paper towel, they had a huge amount of work to do with the size of the hotel, yet everything was excellently cleaned, towels replaced and trash taken away like magic every day. The pool guys seem to be cleaning and brushing and tidying all the time, and were very cheery and pleasant, especially one older guy who greeted us every morning.

The breakfast was good value and was well tasty and the pool area was fantastic. Just a few negative points but nothing too serious - the hotel could do with having an indoor bar and restaurant as the outdoor pool bar tends to close during the frequent thunder storms and if you want to stay in to eat the menu there is very limited (although the food was good). Also the bar closes at 11pm - we're on holiday people!!!! Finally if you don't fancy sticking to your training regime in the styfling Orlando heat the gym is very small and basic for a hotel of this size. On a seperate note if you're visiting the theme parks avoid the i-ride like the plague - it's a disaster, takes forever to arrive and is very uncomfortable. Hire a car or get taxis - the hotel staff will gladly do this for you (ask them to order a yellow cab as they're way cheaper) In summary if I was staying in Orlando again I'd go straight back to the Point as it's a very relaxing place to stay and is very good value.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Savannah, Georgia", "Title": "\u201caverage\u201d", "Author": "moogig", "ReviewID": "UR117497576", "Content": "It wasn't as good as it rated on tripadvisor.

Not large sizes but enough to get by until we could go to the nearby Super Walmart. * Kids LOVED the pool. No fancy slides, just a good. clean, pool to cool off in after a long day at Amusement parks. * Not knowing city layout, you may like to know that hotel was 1 1/2 miles from Universal and about a 15 minute drive to Disney Parks. I initially thought that we would take the free shuttle provided but am REALLY glad I changed my mind last minute and rented a car. After a tiring day walking, the last thing I wanted to do was wait for a bus. People waiting at stops never looked happy. * I liked being able to eat meals at hotel (saving $) rather than a Disney. We ate breakfast in our room, spent the morning/early afternoon at park and bought a snack there, and came home for a late lunch/early dinner and would return to parks for evening parades and fireworks. Worked out great and kept us relaxed and happy. . The hotel does offer a breakfast for a fee. I recommend just buying some cereal or bagels to eat in your own kitchen. * Laundry in unit allowed us to pack light! * Close to action but far enough away from it that we didn't have to live with it 24/7. Quiet at night time. * No push to have you buy a condo. Just a sign in elevator that they were available if you were interested.

Either walk it (it's about 30 minutes away on foot) or get a taxi which will only set you back $6 each way. -Try and find an evening to head to nearby Pizza Xtreme for dinner, a tiny little family-run pizza joint that provided the best pizza I've ever had.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cGreat value - but avoid the breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Robin R", "ReviewID": "UR116791897", "Content": "This hotel is great value for Orlando.

Unfortunately the shuttle runs once in the morning (and not even to get you there at the opening), and once at 9:30pm to bring you back. Very inconvenient for a day when the temperature feels like 110 in the shade. The breakfast was not worth the $9. Get a coffee and head somewhere else or plan to have a breakfast snack in your refrigerator. This is a condo resort so the amenities are thin at best.

We were in Orlando for a ballet performance and were not interested in the Disney Parks - if we had been, then this would be a great location for those activities. We were in the Junior Executive Suite and it is spacious. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were nice and my daughter slept on the pullout couch without complaints. They did provide a small coffee maker and did provide packets of coffee on request. The room was quiet and we were not bothered by noise from guests (we were on the 2nd floor directly above the pool) after 10:00 at night. Cons: There was only one mirror in the entire \"condo\" (in the bathroom) and this proved difficult for three women. There was only one outlet in the bathroom. When you turn on the light in the bathroom, the fan automatically turns on - this made it difficult to hear above the fan if you are talking to someone outside the bathroom. If someone wakes earlier than the others, the only way to not disturb the others who are sleeping is to sit in the bathroom because of the way the lighting is arranged. There is no continental breakfast provided or free coffee in the lobby. There is a charge for using the business facilities or using the computer in the business room. There is a charge for using the phone in the room. You may be charged if you over use your towels. There seemed to be a lot of hidden charges and we were careful to not do anything to incur a charge.

My husband, 13 years old son and myself stayed in a one bedroom apartment which was very spacious, however bit of an inconvenience having to pull out the sofa bed every evening. The beds and pillows were so comfortable and fresh towels provided daily, however if you want your bed changed or bathroom cleaned, it is at an extra cost My 20 years old son and his girlfriend were in a studio apartment which was also very nice, however don't expect the same standard as the one bedroom, they asked for a toaster several times over the two week stay and although advised they would get one, never did. There is very little for teenagers to do at the hotel other than the swimming pool, no pool tables or games room, although there is an internet room but you have to pay 25 cents a minute for the pleasure. I was really surprised with previous comments stating that the breakfast was good. We only had breakfast once and this was only because we were given tokens by the hotel. The breakfast was awful, consisted of chewy scrambled egg and fatty streaky bacon, cereal, toast or bagel, definitely not worth $8.95 a day, also there are only 5 tables in the breakfast area that is in the reception area, not ideal. We were only thankful that we did not include breakfast within our package. The reason the hotel gave us breakfast tokens was because we were over-charged by the Hotel Taxi Company, One Way, who do not have meters and charged $35 for a journey to the Florida Mall, however on the way back we jumped in a yellow taxi, with a meter, they charged $13. I was shocked at the response from the hotel staff who stated that they are aware that the taxi company they use charge per person and not just for the miles travelled and continue to call this company anytime you need a taxi. Don't not use the hotel taxis absolute rip-off! There is no restaurant as such, there is a pool bar where us can purchased snacks, burgers, chicken sandwich, fries etc. There was also a bit of sting in the tail on checking out, we were charged $78 per room for services i.e., provision of pool towels and free coffee in your room?? WARNING: What ever you do, do not go anywhere near I-Electronics, 6550 International Drive. We were sold a video camera, $425, apparently Hitachi with all mod cons, however on getting it back to the hotel and trying out the camera we discovered it did none of the things described by the con-man who sold us it.

The front desk staff was very courteous, check-in was quicker than any other hotel I've ever stayed at. Our package gave us free breakfast every morning; the food was pretty good, but frankly if it had not been included we would have gone down the road to Perkins or IHOP, ordered exactly what we wanted and paid a lot less. Our room was very nice, we stayed in a one bedroom grand suite. Room highlights: full kitchen with big fridge, stove (not that I cooked!), toaster, coffeemaker, blender and dishwasher. Cabinets were stocked with dishes, glasses and silverware. And pots and pans, if you wanted to cook. King size bed was very comfortable. Ceiling fans in both the bedroom and living room area were very nice. Absolute best: efficiency washer and dryer IN THE ROOM!!!! We were able to pack much lighter and just wash and rewear our clothes. the bathroom was also nice, roomy with a shower stall and a separate whirlpool tub. Room minuses: the sofabed was dismal. The mattress was thin and ratty looking, and the whole thing bowed in the middle so your head and feet were high while your bottom sagged low. Luckily we brought a couple of air mattresses to sleep on, so it was fine. Also, the only mirror in the entire suite was in the bathroom. We would definitely stay here again. The pool was very nice and clean, they offer pool towels so we didn't have to use our own beach towels every day. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous. the hotel was within walking distance of Wet 'n Wild, and a 2-minute car ride to Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure. It is right in the middle of everything, yet it sits far enough back off the road that there is very little traffic noise. Last note: we had a choice of a pool view or a Universal Studios view from our room. We chose Universal, figuring we could look at a pool anywhere. However, Universal is far off in the distance, and up close is a small man made lake/drainage area that looks like the dead marshes from LOTR. And just beyond that is the back lot of Veolia waste company. Not attractive.

The first was back in 2009 and most recently the week of July 16th. A few things have changed since our first visit back in 2009, with those welcome changes being the addition of a restaurant and availability of a on premise breakfast option. Additional lounging furniture, tables and a pool-side bar/cabana has been added with several flat screen televisions for viewing. We stayed in the Grand One Bedroom Suite. I would highly recommend this if you have children. This room comes with a full kitchen with washer & dryer. There is a separate sitting room with a sofa bed and table. We chose a \"Universal view\" with the room facing towards Universal Studios. The Grand Suite also contains a large bathroom with a Jacuzzi. In 2009 our room faced the pool however we changed this year because in 2009 the noise of late night and early morning swimmers were loud (in one case someone brought the radio out to the pool and it was blarring!). You should also be aware that the hotel offers room \"refreshes\". After arriving back from a day on the town we were disappointed to find that our room had not been \"refreshed\". We called down for fresh towels, which were brought up promptly. Some great things about our stay: * We had an early flight into Orlando and when we arrived at the hotel to inform them we were here and to ask to be contacted as soon as our room became available (check-in is not until 4pm) we surprised to be told that they did have a room available and allowed us to check-in right away. This allowed us time to freshen up from our flight and get ready for our night a Medieval Times. * This hotel is in a GREAT location. Getting in and out of the hotel property, via car, is simple and not congested as some hotels along the I-Drive or Sandlake Road. It is within walking distance of Wet-n-Wild water park and five minutes from Universal Studios. It is also minutes from a ton of attractions on International Drive, Disney and stores. A few things I did not like about this stay. * While there is free in-room internet access there is no in-room WiFi. This is important because many people, such as myself, have substituted laptops with ethernet ports for iPhones, Androids and iPads (and other mobile devices), which function much more efficiently using WiFi. * Our room had an older model TV while the living/sitting room had a newer flat screen TV. The older TV greatly limited the channels available in the bedroom to about a dozen with other channels such as Animal Planet, Cooking Chanel, News Networks etc... unavailable. This may seem small, however if you have small children you will spend more time in the hotel room than you may have spent if you were there with no children. * Back in 2009 a business conference area was made available. I used this to do early check-in from the hotel AND print our tickets. This room is no longer available (or at least I did not see it). * We purchased a daily breakfast option for two people. Upon check-in there were not enough breakfast vouchers printed and we only received vouchers for two days. The young lady who checked us in said she would send up the remaining three, however they never arrived. SORRY WE DID EAT AT THE RESTAURANT! WE JUST PLANNED TO EAT OUT DURING OUR VACATION. In summary, if we decide to vacation in Orlando again we will most likely stay at the Point again.

The food and beverage manager is a really nice guy and the breakfast crew are super sweet and very hard workers and do a great job. Front desk staff is extremely nice! Now for the downside: Big bulky tv's that made me feel I was in the 90's, the cable flickered on and off and kept cutting out at very frustrating times of the news programs I was watching, not enough pillows in room, they didn't give us enough towels (occupation of 4 and we got 3 towels upon arrival and only 2 the next day from housekeeping) they did send more up eventually but couldn't right away when we needed them because \"the linens hadn't arrived yet.\" Other downsides: the furniture in the living area had a good amount of dust on it upon arrival, the breakfast was the same every day (okay if it's free but at $9 I would like to see some variety) the outside pool bar was really bad service (the guy was great but the girl was really ditzy and gave horrible service i.e. didn't know liquor's they carried, charged us for a 7-up back even thought we ordered a shot of vodka, no plates with the pizza we ordered. She said she could go in and get some if we wanted. Um, we wouldn't of asked if we didn't want them!), no wireless internet in rooms so we couldn't both be on our computers at the same time, the coffee maker didn't work, small breakfast area in lobby and there weren't always enough seats, the shuttle to Disney was a selling point for us to stay there but we never used it because they ran at horrible times. Overall it was a good experience. It was definitely worth it for the price. The rooms are nice and if you don't mind not receiving top-notch customer service you'll love it. I'm not sure I would stay there again. With so many hotel options Orlando I would probably try another hotel.

The room is great, the front room was nice, and the internet worked very well, which was a plus since we watched Netflix a lot (we brought our own wireless network though, since it's wired internet there). Only complaint is that they don't have a DVD player in the front room, or the ability to order movies, but you can always bring your own dvd player or a cord to connect your laptop. Hotel staff were courteous, and in fact, when we checked in, we asked about promotions and the hotel desk changed the promotion on our order, saving us $100 on our reservation! (8-night stay).

There was a well appointed kitchen area with dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, microwave and huge fridge freezer and oven with hob. All utensils that you need are provided. The living area was comfortable and had a large screen TV. The bedroom had a queen size bed in it which was on the hard side for us but was not uncomfortable, there was another TV in the bedroom. The bathroom is massive and had a jaccuzzi bath in it, a hairdryer is also provided. There are internet connections in the living area and the bedroom. The location of the hotel is on Carrier Drive just off International Drive and only a short walk from Wet'n'Wild. Driving in Florida is an experience and it took me a day or two to get used to it but after that I really enjoyed it. Driving to the parks is really easy as they are all just off International Drive, that is the universal parks (we did not do any Disney Parks). One tip is to take a photo of the car park lane you are parked in as the car parks are like everything else in Florida (Massive). This is especially useful when in Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure. We also went to to some of the shopping malls, we got directions from the reception and these were easy to find as well. The day after we arrived we attended a Thomas Cook welcome meeting at the Nascar Grill in City Walk and we got some useful information here and also some discount vouchers for various attractions on I-Drive. Although if you have booked with someone else you can get some of the vouchers on a I-Drive map available at the hotel reception.

Also if you want a quiet time do not take a studio at this hotel as you will not get any peace at all. As I looked round the room I noticed several things that were not right. Stains on the carpet and overall the carpet looked grubby and in need of a good clean, The top of the microwave was caked in dust that thick you can write your name in it. And why give you an ice bucket in the room when there is no ice machine for guests to use. You have to ask for ice and they get it for you from the restaurant. In the bathroom the towels were all odd and several were discoloured. The main point that really annoyed me was the black mould that was growing all over the tile grout round the bath and I don\u2019t mean little specks I mean large obvious patches of thick black mould. The bed was quite comfortable but the same cannot be said for the pillows, they were of the cheapest quality that gave you no support on your neck at all.

June 6& 7 The pro's: The hotel is pleasant and clean.. The staff helpful. The location to Universal Studios great. The cons: very unsecured parking (no tickets or patrolling of lot ( as a woman felt uncomfortable parking at night) The pull out sofa unusable by anyone over the age of 5. Literally 2 1/2 thick, my daughters and I all slept in the one king bed ( age 21 and 14). The comfort level of the bed and pillows mediocre at best. The studio room had older styled tv and no DVD . Odd for a newer complex. Came back in mid afternoon (after day at park) and room had not been serviced had to ask front desk to send housekeeping.. Upon checkout I commented about the resort fee I felt it is unwarranted, did not have to argue. It was removed from bill. Again staff was top notch. I would stay again if only two people. Then again with other properties in the area I will probably check out other locations before I return.

The room was spacious, comfortable and clean. The staff was a super friendly crew, always smiling and saying hello. We were lucky enought to be on the 10th floor so we got a cool view of the pool (which even though we didn't swim in it looked nice) and then an amusement park or water park that was off in the distance. Our main goal was to head to Disneyworld, so we tried the free shuttle the first day and it was great. The shuttle driver was even nice enough to wait for me while I was getting my breakfast too (I hope I didn't make anyone else on the shuttle mad!). We were luckily the first stop, so we were able to get seats. The shuttle does stop at quite a few hotels, but the drive is short (maybe 30 minutes tops) so it's a great perk.

We stayed at the Point Resort for 2 weeks in April 2011. The rooms were huge, much bigger than I was expecting - plenty of room for all our gear. We got a two bedroom apartment which would easily have functioned as two separate apartments. The kids room had a big bed, tv, their own separate kitchen and bedroom. We got a separte tv room/kitchen area which had everything you would need, washer, dryer, dishwasher, cooker, cooking pans. We didnt cook but if you are so inclined on holiday then everything is there for you. The second bedroom also had a tv, with a huge ensuite with a jacuzzi bath, shower, separate toilet room, airing press. The beds are v. very comfortable which is important when you come back from parks tired. We had a nice view over the pool area - at night you could see the fireworks at Disney in the distance. Outside there is a nice pool with a lovely hottub which is great after a long day walking in the parks. A new bar pool has just opened which is a nice addition. There is an indoor gym next to the pool area. The hotel is in a good location for parks - wet n wild is 5 mins walk away. Universal Studios is just a mile down the road. We didn't drive, but a free shuttle bus brings you to all the parks. There is a nice TGI Fridays and a Chilis about 5/6 mins walk away. There is a small area in the lobby where you can get breakfast in morning (they serve starbucks coffee) and they serve tapas/snacks in evening. We didn' t eat there as we self-catered for breakfast, but the food looked nice. I would definitely recommend this hotel to someone travelling with children who wants a bit more space than a hotel and some of the comforts of home.

Their kitchen and bar are open until 11 PM. But you can always stock up on drinks and food because the kitchen is well equipped, order food and have it delivered, or just eat at the various local restaurants (China Jade was pretty good) The staff is very friendly and ready to assist you with whatever you need.

It is not on I-Drive, however, being off of International Drive can be a positive thing because it can get congested on I-Drive with all the traffic . Minor things I would have added to the rooms, sheer drapes to let sunlight in without allowing a full view of the inside of the room and a full length mirror in the bedroom (the only mirror was on the bathroom wall) This place is great for families or couples who want to relax as there is not a lot of \"hustle & bustle\" at this hotel, but by no means is it desolate.

But the kids were so exhausted after the excitement of the theme parks they slept well anyway. King bed was comfy. Pool was great, kids really enjoyed it. A couple of quirks. Fitness center has only a couple of machines, no clock, no tv and opens only at 7...so not good for us moms who have to fit in fitness before our families wake up! Coffee bar only open certain times (not in the afternoon...which we thought was a bit odd...). No wireless(or even free wireless) which is really backwards. Maid/cleaning service is confusing. Not sure what we should have expected. But they did freshen towels and make beds. Hotel staff were extremely helpful and polite. Overall: will go back.

First Overall Impression: The multi-story hotel building has a nice and modern, but reserved and understated design - i.e. no eye-popping features or glitz on the exterior. The lobby/reception area is nice and comfortable. Staff: Cordial and professional. We only needed minimal interaction with the staff during our stay - this was good, since most of what we needed were readily available or easy to locate. Amenities: Free parking, Free high-speed wired internet access in each room, wireless internet access in lobby area. Decent outdoor swimming pool with bar. We did not use the Bistro or fitness room. Room: Wow! We booked a one bedroom suite and got a fully and nicely furnished one bedroom condo - complete with separate bedroom, bathroom, living room, full kitchen, and balcony. The bathroom alone is larger that some hotel rooms. The suite was generously equipped - washer/dryer, dishes and utensils... everything - even a pyrex measuring cup.

I stayed here for 2 weeks with my boyfriend, When we got to the hotel, which is very easy to find and is within walking distance to wet and wild and universal studios we were greeted by the lovely hotel staff. Look out for Britney at the front desk and Ricardo. They are both the most genuine, friendly and helpful people ever and can not do enough for you to make your stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible, We were given advice and maps on local attractions and where to eat and shop which was very helpful. The hotel is very well kept, the pool area is lovely and there are plenty of complimentry towel available. The gym is basic but does the job. It has 2 treadmills, a weight machine, cross trainer and spin bike. The parking is free and there were always spaces whatever time of day. The rooms are lovely! We very kindly got ungraded to a one bedroom suite which is massive. You have a full kitchen with all mod cons and a washer and dryer which also came in very handy being there for 2 weeks. The bathroom is beautiful and has a walk in shower and whirlpool bath. The maid service is great making your bed and replacing towels etc daily. The bed was massive and very comfy, there was 2 televisions one in the bedroom and one in the living room with plenty of channels too. We were on the 5th floor and had a balcony overlooking the pool which was very pretty. The hotel had free wifi in the reception area and wired in the rooms however there was an internet room which you could pay for that also had a printer. Saying this the front desk staff were super helpful and were more than happy to print the odd bit for us when we asked and even offered to check us in for our flight home and printed our boarding cards free of charge. The staff really go above and beyond for their guests. The hotel is big and busy enough that you dont feel lke your the only guest but not so big you get forgotton. It was the perfect place to stay for a magical holiday to orlando florida. We will without a doubt be visiting all the lovely staff at the point again next year.

After looking up many reviews on Tripadvisor, we found The Point resort to have glowing reviews, and rightly so. We chose a one bedroom suite for our stay, complete with full kitchen, jacuzzi bath and separate shower, and we were not disappointed. We arrived at the hotel early, so we stowed our luggage at the reception with the lovely lady who greeted us, and she looked after it for us whilst we went across to the next hotel to hire a car for the day. We couldn't believe how close we were to Wet n Wild, as it is quite literally opposite the hotel! We hired a car and headed off to explore International Drive and find a supermarket to equip our kitchen. When we returned our room was ready, so we loaded up a trolley and headed up to our room on the 11th floor. When we first entered the room we could not believe how large it was, with a full kitchen as advertised, a large front room with French doors out to a balcony with the most amazing view. We then went through to the bedroom, with a huge bed and big windows, and next door was a large bathroom with jacuzzi bath, a separate double size shower, sink with huge mirror and plenty of space for toiletries, and a separate toilet. Our first impressions were very good indeed. The kitchen was fabulous, with a small dining table in the front room which was perfect for two. The hotel provide everything you need in the kitchen, and there is also a washer and dryer which made our holiday so much better - nobody wants to spend their precious holiday time at the launderette! There was a basic maid service every day which included fresh towels, emptying the bins and making the bed, and a full service once a week. We stayed at the resort for 2 weeks, so the space and the amenities were important to us. Half way through our stay our super dooper high speed wired internet and our phone stopped working, so I went down to use the phone in reception to make a call. The receptionist was very apologetic, and explained that one of the transformers (or something similar) had stopped working and the phone company were on their way. He connected my call, and apologised again once I had finished - I said that these things happen, and not to worry about it, but he insisted that the hotel take customer service very seriously and removed the daily hotel service charge from our bill for the rest of our stay. Our internet and phone were only out for one day, it was promptly fixed, and a couple of days later we came home to find a hand-written note from the receptionist again apologising for the inconvenience, with a selection of snacks and some bottled water. Their customer service is second to none and we were very impressed! In terms of location, it is on the same road as Universal, and you could even walk it if you weren't afraid of tired legs by the end of the day! We drove there to use the park during the day (paying crazy parking fees at the theme parks is quite irritating, but not much you can do about that), and a couple of times we went to Universal Boardwalk in the evening and took a cab - it was about $7 each way. The resort is right on International Drive, which has great shops, lots of restaurants and bars, and tons of crazy golf! The I-Trolley runs a route that goes past the hotel, or you can stroll up onto the main road (International Drive) and pick up a trolley very quickly and easily. The Point Hotel has a lovely pool and very hot spa pool too, although they have not yet opened the pool bar next to it. They have plenty of loungers and fresh towels available, and some tables with umbrellas for those who prefer the shade. There is a small gym too. We really enjoyed our stay here, the room was fantastic with the most beautiful views, especially at sunset, the service was brilliant and the location is fab. I think the hotel would also suit families, with the convenience of having a kitchen and washer/dryer, the pool is also great for kids, and the proximity to Universal and Wet n Wild. I would highly recommend this hotel, and like to thank The Point for helping to make our honeymoon so fantastic!", "Date": "April 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cIt was nice.\u201d", "Author": "Patty0127", "ReviewID": "UR103166194", "Content": "The hotel was beautiful.

However, there are much better hotels to choose from in this area and for much better, lower rates as well!! We figured we would pay more as we wanted to treat ourselves before we went on our cruise but it was such a bad mistake. The hotel was not very clean - in fact the carpets were positively filthy!! Also the bed was the most uncomfortable bed we have ever slept on and the result was that neither one of us got much sleep due to the sagging mattress and poor quality of the bed. They really need to invest in some decent beds in this establishment!!! After all, when you book to stay at a hotel it is in the hope of being able to get some rest before continuing with your onward travel - we were both exhausted after our stay at this hotel and found the staff to be very unhelpful and disinterested when we told them of the problems. There are much much better hotels to choose from in Orlando than this one and the biggest mystery to me is how this hotel is so high in the ratings on Trip Advisor as our experience there bears no relation whatsoever to how some of the reviewers have described it.

There are restaurants and everything you may need close by but I love that the hotel sits off the road a bit so the noise level is at a minimum. I never once heard cars driving by. We opted for the one bedroom suite for the extra space and full kitchen. To start off the room is great. We were able to make breakfast every morning before heading to Universal Studios and having the in room washer and dryer was convenient for drying wet towels and cloths from being wet at the parks. The beds were more than comfortable and the comforter was the best I've ever had in a hotel. It wasn't cheap and flat and nothing too it like most hotels. It was a nice fluffy down comforter I think. Very cozy. It was also nice having the balcony and being able to have coffee in the morning or watch the sunset or just relax during the evening hours with a breeze. The staff was very friendly and helpful with everything we needed. They fulfilled all of our special requests, which was a first for me. We requested a high room overlooking the pool.

The other is the cost for the breakfast. Save your money and buy food to make in your room for breakfast. Even if it's just bagels and cream cheese it's worth it.

As soon as we sat on the bed we knew it wasn't right - it was very creaky and dipped in the middle. It felt like we were on a noisy waterbed! We asked to be moved but as the hotel was full the lady on reception offered to send up the maintenance man to repair it. He admitted the beds were cheap and poor quaity - in fact they were two single beds fixed together and the whole thing looked very bad. Someone had broken the wooden slat which explained the dip and feeling of being on a waterbed! As the maintenace men struggled to repair the bed we were allocated a room across the hall which although the bed wasn't broken was equally uncomfortable and squishy. The bottom line is the beds are cheap and not what you expect of a hotel of this standard. The carpets in the corridors were dirty and looked like they hadn't been vacummed for a long time. I think it would be better to forget the kitchenette (unnecessary in Orlando with the multitude of restaurants and food outlets) and invest in good quality beds. A fridge is always handy for drinks etc but the supersize microwave and sink seemed like a poor choice.

We took the return shuttle at the end of the day and it stopped first at a Best Western that seemed to be far away. Another couple on the shuttle told us that they had taken a cab to Universal and it was only $6. Since it's $15/day to park at Universal, it's well worth any inconvenience associated with the shuttle times (one AM, one PM). We got coffee (Starbucks) and pastries at the Bistro before leaving for the park, both were good. This was the only time I saw the Bistro open, although they also call it a Martini Bar. I could've used one! The pool was very nice, and heated according to my son. I asked the front desk to refer me to a local seafood buffet and the man suggested Golden Corral or Sizzler. Lol.

The hotel is actually a condominium complex with extra rooms for hotel rental.

Not once was I bothered by kids running, loud neighbors, or showers from next door. Everything is very quiet, and despite it being a large building, it seemed as if we were there by ourselves. If we needed anything, food suggestions, toiletries, extra towels, etc., the staff was quick to help us. Fabio is a great host, and he actually made the visit more personalized because he would say hello everytime I walked in. He would also ask questions about how our trip was going, all the while remembering what we spoke about last. It made us feel really comfortable. I have a large amount of points accumulated with a chain hotel, and I could have easily stayed at one of those brands for free, but I wanted something more private, so I tried The Point, and it was completely worth it. The pictures on the website and on other travel websites are true to how it really looks, and everything is really clean. The Point is also close to everything, but away enough from the hype and noise of I-Drive. I will return upon my next visit to Orlando, and I will definitely recommend it to others. FYI, there is no full blown restaurant on property (they have a bistro with drinks, small bites, coffee, and breakfast), nor is there room service, but there is really no need for them because the rooms have kitchens, and if you feel like eating late, order delivery, or drive/walk close by to grab something.

The location was good for visiting Universal Studios and if we visit Universal again we might stay here as long as we could get a room that did not face a huge security light, or the auto shop nearby. The auto shop was a bit noisy, but once they closed down for the weekend there was no more activity there. Frankly the auto shop was a turnoff for many reasons.

It is actually a vacation ownership property. However, like almost all vacation ownership properties in Orlando, the rooms can be rented by the night. The Point was built in 2008, so it is very new compared to most of the hotels in the area. It features a south American motif. You can sense a high level of detail in the decor, and in general there is a subtle sophistication that permeates the property. This hotel is the last one in my list of Universal Partner hotels within walking distance of resort. I have included it because it is the closest villa-style hotel to the parks. It is also by far the most upscale partner hotel within walking distance. Now, it'll be a good 25+ minute walk from here over to Universal. But it is a very simple walk--you just head straight down Universal Blvd--and I think it is surprisingly enjoyable. Now this hotel certainly has some downsides. Given the nature of its larger accommodations and upscale feel, the nightly rate is going to be higher than most of the hotels in the area. In addition to this, because the property is so new, it definitely has a not-quite-finished look and feel to it. In fact, last time I visited (about two months ago), their on-site restaurant still wasn't opened. The other major downside to Point Orlando is that every bed in every room is a king--no double doubles or double queens. There are plenty of sofabeds to be found, but it would sure have been nice to be able to book a 2-bedroom suite with a king in the master and two doubles in the second bedroom. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a bit of elegance, a bit of peace and quite (The Point is somewhat removed from International Drive), yet you want to be able to walk to Universal if you have to, this is a fine selection.

The room was fantastic, it had everything you need for a stay of 6 days and was spotless. The pool area had plenty of seating and had a hot tub, free towels and was kept very clean and tidy. The resort has a small bar that we did not use but looked well stocked and cosy. The hotel is just behind Wet & Wild so is very handy for Universal Studios and there is also an Iride stop just outside. You get what you pay for in this life and in this case its true.

Loved the look and sound of its description. On arrival, the receptionist was jovial and welcomed us (hubby, daughter and I) to a two bedroom luxury apartment on the third floor in tower one. Our arrival was pretty late so we made use of the \"welcome coffee\" that awaited us and retired for the night. We had noticed that the walls were in need of refreshing- a splash of paint to cover the many-scuffed and stained walls. However, we have stayed in worse places. I found it hard to get to sleep because of a droning noise. I turned off the A/C but that wasn't the source of the drone. I discovered that right next to the building, there was a small building that I think was a powerhouse or pump for the pool or electricity. I bought earplugs from Walgreens and problem solved! However, I now learn that the higher the floor, the less the noise. In daylight, the many stains on the carpet was very obvious. I was put off a walking in socked feet bit. However, we decided not to complain as we didn't want to waste time looking for another suite so close to the Halloween rush. We made a point of staying out as much as possible. We did make use of the lovely swimming pool and hot tub and also their shuttles to Disney were excellent! The maids came in every day to make the beds and empty bins as promised. We were taken aback by the resort fee as other, who have pointed out on this site. To conclude. The Point is an OK place but in dire need of a lick of paint. The carpets need steaming and the third floor tower one is noisy. The pool is nice as is the hot tub. The shuttles are dependable. I did expect better cleanliness for the price I paid for the suite.

The bathroom was big enough to play hockey in, huge garden style tub, walk-in shower, large granite-top counter w/ sink, separate toilet closet, full size linen closet, beautiful waxed tile floor. I'm not kidding when I say you could have eaten off the floor it was so clean. Towels were replaced daily. The bed was so comfortable, we missed breakfast all three mornings we were there. Pillows were very comfortable, not too firm or too soft. They were the short style that most places have switched to, but there were some longer ones in the closet, as well as extra sheets. The kitchen was fully equipped w/ a full size fridge, range, dishwasher and stackable W/D, as well as dinner ware for 6 people, pots and pans, a butcher block and jar of kitchen gadgets. If we had stayed longer, I would have hit the grocery store and cooked for us. According to some literature in the room and in the lobby, this hotel has \"ownership opportunities\" which usually means \"time-share.\" Nothing in the booking info mentioned TS, or I probably would have booked elsewhere. That said, at no time were we ever asked to attend the \"Presentation\" or in any other way approached by anyone about anything TS related. We spent most of our time at the theme parks, but coming back at night truly felt like coming home. Nothing about the room felt hotel-ish. There were ceiling fans in both rooms, central A/C, good size flat panel TV in the living room, decent TV for the bedroom, but we didn't watch much TV. Parking was adequate, we were issued a permit for dashboard display. They do have on-site security as well as a well-lit parking lot. It's a little bit of a drive if you're going to do Disney, approx. 15-25 min depending on traffic, but is a perfect spot if you're doing Universal like we did, literally down the street.

There was ~20 people waiting at 8:40 am for a ride over to get to the park before it opened to see the Harry Potter experience at Universal. Why not invest in a bus or shuttle? Don't most people come to the resort to attend the parks? Also the hotel makes no effort in organizing this matter. The first people to jump in the van go tot the park which I'm sure you can imagine gets tense. I shouldn't have to fight with other people on my vacation to get a ride to the park. The hotel is closer than other hotels in the area but after a long day at the parks a 2 mile walk is the last thing you want to do. On a positive note the rooms were very clean and nice, which is very important. I'm not a very picky person at all, but I do expect to get good service when I spend $140 to stay at your hotel.

I was glad to find a \"new\" property (both in terms of age and my experience with it) that offered a full kitchen, living room and king size bed for my family of four on a quick Disney (3 day) trip. I was looking for a good standby when Disney resorts are packed/ too expensive or when my timeshare gets old (they still call me to buy even though I own). I felt a little misled as the term \"resort\" isn't appropriate for this property. It's a hotel, a nice hotel with a full kitchen in room, but a hotel. Check in was fast and easy, with no line. I paid a government rate at 103 per night. The hotel charges a mandatory \"resort fee\" of $10 per night. This covers your internet usage in room and the pool. I was really disappointed by this fee. I never used the internet and the pool should be included with the room rate. The hotel's \"restaurant\" was really just a small bar with 3 tables. We didn't eat the breakfast buffet at $10 per adult as we brought groceries and had a hot breakfast in room. They did provide \"buy one adult buffet get one\" coupons upon our request though. The first room we were given had the intense odor of cigarettes as soon as we opened the door. The desk staff quickly got me into a different room that was great. It looked like it was less than 6 months old. I was disappointed that the tv in the bedroom wasn't HD but then again no HD receiver was in the room so it wasn't 720/1080 anyway. There wasn't a DVD player either. The channels went from 2-77 but all the kids channels and TLC, Discover were there so it worked. The pool and hot tub were nice and there was no crowd even on a Saturday which at most resorts (Disney, Westgate, etc.) is never the case. All children had parental accompaniment. There wasn't a pool bar, but I don't drink so I liked that. There were a group of late 20, 30 something's who appeared to be drinking but they were reserved. I saw a small weight room but never took advantage of it as I was only there for 2 nights. I really disliked the fact that the property is unsecured/ungated. The door is open 24/7 with the desk staff the only prevention from a bad guy coming in. I got several \"pizza flyers\" under my door daily. I did appreciate a OPD officer running radar outside on both nights. It was an off duty gig paid for by the city though. As a law enforcement officer myself I asked him about the crime rate and he indicated it was a good area. So overall, I gave it a 3.5/5 because of the smoked in room, no security/gate and lack of the amenities I'm used to at a resort (on site movie rental, real restaurant, game room/activities for the kids). For the price I think I'll continue searching for a Disney, timeshare standby. In addition, this hotel is near Universal and pirates dinner theater, but really too far from Disney (traffic is crazy on I4). I would use this resort again for business travel but not for family vacation unless I could get it for around $70/ night with no resort fee and free breakfast.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201c22 nights at the Point .GREAT ||||\u201d", "Author": "gdi4one", "ReviewID": "UR82458723", "Content": "Just returned 5th Oct after 22 nights in Florida sunshine. 1st time at the Point .We opted for the one bedroomed appartment which came with luxary bathroom to include jacuzi bath and large walk-in shower ideal to refresh after the 91 % humidity at the parks.The kitchen area was complete with all moden appliances from full size cooker , dishwasher , to washer and dryer but best was full size american fridge to keep the bud cool and the ice on tap.The seperate bedroom and the ballcony was a great addition to give a feeling of space.It was like a self contained appartment with the advantage of having front desk and daily clean towels and bed making with rooms getting the full monty once a week.

We opted for a 1 bedroom suite, with a pull out sofa in the living room. We got to the hotel very early, @ 9:30am. God bless the Point - we were allowed to check in as the room was available - that alone made us LOVE the place! We got settled, and had a great stay. The kitchenette was well appointed, including an icemaker in the freezer and an ice bucket, a full sized stove, D/W, etc, and we even utilized the washer/dryer for a load of laundry. The suite was VERY roomy - SO much better than a 1 room at 3x the price in an on-site hotel. The pool was good-sized, with pool toys for the kids, and a hot tub -although there was construction going on, we noticed nothing(ie noise and disruption). We had called prior to coming and requested an upper floor with views of Universal - got the top floor with a great view. Flat screen TV in main room, regular one in bedroom (but who cares?! - we didn't!) We did only get 3 towels in the room, with 4 people checked in, but promptly received more after requesting (within 10 minutes) Bed was super comfy. On day of departure, we were able to get a late check out, and hung out at the pool as long as we wanted - there was a place to change, and they held your bags for you behind the front desk. If you want an \"all-in-one\" kind of place, you'd be slightly disappointed, as there was no restaurant, but you can get drinks and apps(we got some beers, but no food). Breakfast was good but a little pricey. I am glad we didn't go for the 2 bedroom - the way they're set up, they are actually a 1-bedroom and a studio with 2 doors that open to each other in a foyer. I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with little kids being in a different area than ours. For older children (or adults, of course) it would be a fine arrangement. Highly recommend, and would DEFINITELY stay there again - THANK YOU to all the staff at the Point!! **A couple of points for getting around, not really related to the hotel. The trip to/from the airport is @ $35 via a regular yellow cab. If the hotel calls their car service, it's $50. To Universal, it's @ $6-7 taxi, with the car service, $8 - 12. I DON'T recommend the i-Ride trolley to the park - it's cheap, but it drops you off FAR from the park - 10 minute hike at a good pace. You're better off springing for the taxi, as once you're at the entrance, it's another hike INTO the park. Renting a car comes in most handy for getting around to the restaurants, malls, etc in the evening.

The prices were very reasonable for the type of room we stayed in, which was the grande suite, which included a full kitchen, bath (with a whirpool tub), bedroom (with king sized bed), and living area (with a sleeper sofa). The bed was amazing and likely the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on! My husband raved about hom much he loved the bed, kitchen (which had a full fridge, a dishwasher, and plenty of dishes, pots, and pans), and just the room in general. The room felt more like a 1br condo than a hotel room. The only thing I wasn't really happy about was that the website advised there was bellhop service, which was not present when we stayed. We were told a luggage carrier was in the coat closet in the lobby and we were more than welcome to use it, but there was no one to help us get our bags and food we brought to our room (which was on the 5th floor at the end of the hall). It was a minor hiccup and something my husband and I didn't really mind, considering they made up for it by giving us an extra room key for free to get back in our room when our door slammed shut on us while we were trying to pack up; my husband and I were half asleep and forgot to grab a key, and they were so nice about it. This hotel is starting to offer ownership opportuinities, and my husband and I are looking into ownership of one of the 1br suites should our jobs send us to Orlando like we think they might. We loved the place that much. It's only a block away from Wet-N-Wild, about a mile from Universal, and about a half mile from I-4 if you're headed to Mickey Land. International Drive is only about a block away as well. The greatest thing about this hotel was that it was close to the attractions, but not right in the middle of them. It wasn't like staying in other hotels in the Universal area where you can't sleep because all you can hear outside your window is the bass coming from the attractions at CityWalk. All in all, this is probably one of the better kept secrets where lodging is concerned. I've spent double the money for rooms in Orlando that didn't offer a quarter of what this hotel offers. I highly suggest you look into this hotel. Tip: Definitely spend the extra little bit per night on the grande suite over the junior suite, and either go grocery shopping once you get there (The Wal-Mart on John Young Pkwy. is only about 4 mi. away) or pack a cooler.

This limited my choices of hotels. Imagine my delight in finding The Point Orlando -- which is both lovely and cost efficient. I traveled with my two almost adult children, so I opted for the 2 bedroom suite. It was perfect. It is actually a 1 bedroom 2 room suite connected by a common foyer to a studio apartment. Both sides had a king bed along with a leather couch that folded out to a queen size bed. The 2 room suite had a full size, fully supplied kitchen (service for 8) and the studio had a mini-frig with wet bar (service for 4). Each apartment had a locking door in addition to the \"suite\" door connecting the hall to the foyer. This had the added effect of muting noise in the hallway. This layout allowed my teen son to have privacy -- and us (mother and older sister) to have some privacy as well. (Best part for the ladies -- the jacuzzi tub AND separate large, well lit shower stall in the 2 room suite.) The location was also perfect for us, as we spent our \"park\" time at the Universal Studio/Sea World properties. From door to parking deck was less than 10 minutes to the Universal parks and less than 15 minutes to Sea World and Aquatica. Wet & Wild water park was about a block away. We did not go to Disney -- however, my understanding is that it, too, is less than 15 to 20 minutes away. Also, the hotel has complimentary \"bus\" service to and from the parks (once going in am, once coming back in pm) for those who don't have transportation. The ONLY complaint (from the kids) was that there wasn't a DVD player -- which we solved by purchasing an S-video cord from WalMart (also less than 10 minutes away) and hooking the lap top to the TV. For those who prefer to eat out -- the hotel has a wonderful buffet breakfast with numerous choices and there are numerous restaurants with a variety of cuisines in the area.

There is not even a fee for parking but it is part of the hotel fee as is the Internet access (handy for our kids) and several other services. Besides that the nightly rates are very reasonable for what you get.We most definately will return to The Point every time we come to Orlando.

When I got to my room, it was not what was expected. I booked the JR. Suite and I am not sure why they called it a suite, because it did not have a balcony or a jacuzzi. I remember the website saying it had those ammentitie when I booked it. When I questioned it with the front desk manager, he said he would call back and never did. He seemed annoyed that I would even question the room. The room was fairly clean; however, I could see little stains on the rugs and dust in areas not used often. Behind end tables etc. The pool was not as nice as it looked on the website. It wasnt terrible however, the big palmetto bug crawling out of the pool led to my demise. I know this was not the hotels fault. The Front desk also did not tell you about the ammenities of the hotel. I was glad i only stayed one night. I have to say I was spoiled from the last hotel I stayed for 4 days. I did not feel welcome at this hotel, and I will not go back.

The Point is a reasonably new hotel, which in fact is better described as a \"condo hotel.\" It is very clean, everything functions, and the rooms are very adequate. We were in a sutie which was actually two rooms: one, a standard room with a king bed and a kitchenette, next to which was a junior suite which had a full kitchen, refrigerator, small living room and a bedroom. The furniture is adequate, the beds comfortable, and everything fairly basic. Nice, large bathroom in the junior suite, and as noted the room was clean and well maintained. There is a small breakfast restaurant downstairs, but no other restaurants on the property. Not a major problem, since there are tons of places to eat nearby. The pool is nice, but not overly large There is a small \"functional\" fitness center. What really struck us was how pleasant and accomodating the front desk staff was to us.

Large Fridge has an ice maker. We liked that you are provided with washing up liquid, sponge/scourer dish washer powder, washing powder, kitchen roll and filter coffee.

Rooms were very quiet and with good blackout curtains (needed as very bright security lights outside). Not much of a view or balcony but we didn't find it an issue. There isn't a safe in the room but free safety deposit box at reception. The Hotel feels safe and secure and we often saw security staff outside the bulding. All the staff are very pleasant and helpful. Thanks to Lauren and Fabio who were at the bar and made us feel very welcome on our first night (its just a shame Lauren introduced my wife to Grey Goose Vodka, as she now likes it a bit too much !) . Fabio also very kindly offered us a late check out on our last day when he realised we had a later flight home. When I asked about using the business center to print out an email, reception offered to print it for me for no charge. It was gestures like this that helped make our stay so enjoyable. A short walk gets you to International drive with a good choice of places to eat and drink. There is also a supermarket nearby. The hotel is less than 2 miles from the Universal Theme park - but we wouldn't recommend walking to it. Pool area is nice, not huge but big enough and we always found free sunbeds. There are vending machines by pool for snacks and drinks, but you can take your own drinks (no glass for safety) as there is no pool bar. It is worth mentioning that the hotel is building a 3rd tower next to the pool so there can be building noise, but most people are out during the day so there was only once in 2 weeks that it affected us when using the pool.

The staff were friendly and welcoming from the outset and very patient, explaining everything very clearly and helping with any additional queries. The open-plan kitchen was well thought out with a range cooker, microwave, fridge and dishwasher, not to mention a washer/dryer combo and airing cupboard which meant we didn't have to pack as many clothes with us for the 10 days and could easily (and quickly) do one load of washing to replenish us for the week. The bathroom was extremely clean and roomy with a bathtub and shower unit, as well as a linen cupboard. The bedroom was very comfortable and we had a comfortable and clean king bed. All throughout the suite there was a great deal of storage space, which is handy if you are staying a while. There are drawers in the living room area as well as a cupboard, drawers and shelves in the bedroom. In the living room, there was a rather large cupboard by the balcony area that I happened to discover by mistake \u2013\u00a0it was large enough to fit two large suitcases, a few bags and other junk in there, keeping the rest of the room clutter free. There were enough hangers in the cupboard to store clothes for two people for a week. There is a high-speed Internet connection in the living room, but this is only via ethernet cable and admittedly I had to ask about where to find it as it was hidden behind the TV. Complementary Wi-Fi service is in the lobby downstairs, though I hope that this is something that the Management hope to introduce to all rooms in the future. For those of you who couldn't be bothered to read the small print when making your booking on sites like hotels.com or listening to the staff at check-in, the $9.95 daily fee is a compulsory resort fee that isn't hidden like others have suggested. Yes, it is an additional charge on top of your reservation and this covers the parking permit, use of the spa and other leisure facilities, the 'daily refresh' service and the high-speed internet in the living room. I'm not sure why they don't bundle it in, but make sure you've read and understood what it's for and that it's there, so that if it does bother you, you know to look elsewhere. Location-wise, the hotel is very well placed. If you're silly enough to follow a sat-nav/GPS and not look at a map of the area beforehand, of course you will have difficulty finding the place as the sat-nav/GPS will direct you along the main road and leave you having to look for a very quick turning. There are THREE ways of accessing the hotel and the parking area \u2013\u00a0two of which are from main roads \u2013\u00a0and it is just 20 minutes drive from Orlando International Airport. We weren't really interested in any of the resorts in the area (as we'd come to view a shuttle launch), but it does present a variety of good places to eat in the evening, as well as being well-connected with the I-4 and SR-528 (takes less than an hour to drive up to Titusville or the Kennedy Space Center, and about an hour to drive up to Daytona Beach, both of which are between 60-70 miles away depending on what roads you take). Things that would've made the stay a lot better would've been having a small safe inside the room for a wallet and documents as it would've saved us carrying extra things we didn't need with us as well as making them easily accessible at the time we did need them (as we locked things up in our suitcases). The view from our window was of a car dealership/garage and a very bright light that shone onto the building \u2013\u00a0this didn't bother us much as we rarely spent time on the balcony or staring out of the bedroom window anyway and at night the curtains were very good, though I can imagine some people might've been bothered by this. We stayed at this place for 10 days this May which is probably ideal for couples or solo travellers as the majority of families on summer holidays haven't really peaked yet. We did not expect or want to spend 10 days in a 'hotel' as we're not into being waited on or having somebody tend after us every five minutes. If you're that shallow and/or bothered about having a flat-screen TV in your living area and/or bedroom, do not stay here. To conclude, I felt a great sense of shame reading some of the reviews on here by people who obviously do not show a great deal of self-responsibilty or common sense. The 'daily refresh' service basically does what it does \u2013\u00a0gives you fresh towels, makes the bed and takes out the rubbish \u2013\u00a0there is no full-on house-keeping service here as the place is already advertised as being a self-catering condo accommodation, so if you live like a slob and trash the place or leave all your own hairs in the bathplug, don't expect somebody to clean up after you. If you run out of toilet paper at home, don't you change it yourself? That's why they leave you toilet roll in the cupboards. This also applies to why they give you dishwasher powder \u2013 if you use the kitchen utensils or crockery they provide for you, you should be old and mature enough to at least clean something yourself. Obviously, if there's something like already dirty linen or whatnot on your first night of stay, then you should take this up with the management, but all in all, IF YOU CANNOT BE BOTHERED TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF OR TAKE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE WAY YOU ARE OR THE WAY YOU BEHAVE WHEN STAYING IN ACCOMMODATION OTHER THAN YOUR OWN HOUSE, DO NOT COME HERE.

We booked a studio but was checked into a one bedroom apartment as a free upgrade, which contained a full kitchen with more than the necessary amenities including a dish washer, washer and drier and a huge fridge/freezer. The building looks brand new and the apartment was in the say state. The bathroom was excellent having a separate shower and bath with jets. The Bed was hugh, the air con was nice a cool as well as being quiet when operational and the balcony view was of the hotels pool and hot tub. I recommend the use of this hot tub, it was fab. It was lovely a hot and a night time dip was the norm for us as a chill out. OVERAL. Check-in was nice and smooth, Check-out was nice and smooth without any hidden costs added to our bill. The staff were very friendly and helpful and our experience was great. If we go back to Orlando.

Maids in every day, but tended to only change the towels and make the bed. They told us they only change the bedlinen if you request it in advance! Not much happening downstairs..saw a little bar in the lobby, but it didn't seem to be open much (maybe as it was not peak season). Pool was great! Plenty of beds and never packed! My husband used the gym, which was small but adequate. He was disappointed though that they had no tv in there. We hired a car, but it was still within a 10 walk to I-Drive.

They have a nice pool, yes, but so does every decent hotel in Florida. The \"fitness center\" is four old machines in a tiny room. Mattress on sleeper sofa was thin and uncomfortable.

This means it's pitch black or you're completely visible at night. The \"bar\" was open on 1 morning during a 4-day stay. Housekeeping was lacking. Had to call for towels 2 times and maid failed to wash our dishes 1 day. Business Center is a rip-off. $0.25/min. for Internet access. every hotel I frequent offers it free.

Checked in with no issues and found the staff friendly and helpful. Lobby is impressive, clean and bright. The room was superb, with tasteful, modern decor, useful items like washing powder and washing up liquid. It was well equiped to cook with, but they have the worst pans we've ever used. Everything stuck to them even using loads of oil. We had a good view of the pool area, everything worked well and was easy to use. The bed was incredibly comfortable, but the aircon was too noisy to have on over night. Lovely jacuzzi bath. The pool area was perfect; quiet, plenty of towels, water not overly deep at any point. Did not make use of food or drinks there, so cannot comment. Location is good in some ways, as it is reasonably close to i-drive and the parks, but not too noisy. In hindsight we would stay nearer to the action, as the i-trolley is for the bus that runs alongside, not on, i-drive and it is every 30 minutes. So lots of plus points, but a real negative was the room service. We noticed that all that was done in our room during the service was the provision of clean, dry towels and the bed being made. It was not cleaned at all. We found out after raising the issue that a new management company has recently taken over and they only clean the room the day that you arrive and the day that you leave! As we were there for 16 days we found this completely unacceptable and after much insistance it was cleaned once. Room service have until 4:30 to do the rooms. When you have spent all day walking around a park (in the heat) and get back at 3pm you might fancy a shower (no dry towels) or a nap (unmade bed). It's not so much that as knowing that if you do have a nap the maid will be along to wake you to make the bed and change the towels. We'd never stayed anywhere that didn't make it a policy to have rooms done by midday. We were told that they only had 1 maid for the whole place. Not very good for a hotel that is 5 star in every other respect. We eventually got tired of calling down to ask for things that were not replenished - toilet roll, bath mat, water, washing powder. We also got back to our room 3 times to find it not serviced at all. On holiday you don't want to spend time complaining, so we left it till the last day and queried the resort fee and it was waived immediately to their credit. Word of warning do not get them to call you a taxi. The first time our taxi did not turn up and as there was only one person serving on reception (a regular theme) with about 4 people waiting. Second time the taxi cost us twice as much as one directly from Universal through Mears. Noticed the receptionist was 'taken care of' by the taxi driver, but we felt taken advantage of. The shuttle service we only used once (fancied a break from driving to have a drink) and vowed never again. It was 15 minutes late, the seatbelts didn't work and we were lucky to get there alive! The journey on the way back which would have taken 15 minutes in the car, took 1.5 hours. I know that the hotel cannot help some of those points, but safety should be something of importance to their guests. I would recommend it based upon the quality of the room, the staff were friendly and helpful (I blame the new management company for housekeeping issues), but I still find it incredibly strange to stay at such a nice hotel and not have the rooms cleaned.

Avoid the breakfast in the hotel, it is poor by European standards. The remote control had one battery missing.

I informed the receptionist that you cannot call something a business centre with important software not installed on the computer.

My girlfriend and I got a junior suite, and we were blown away by the comfort level and amenities. The walk-in shower was very nice, and the bed was extremely comfortable. We had a room on the 10th floor, and it was a nice view. The swimming pool area looked nice, but we never got to the pool. The ceiling fans in the bedroom and living room were really great. The only negative was that the washer and dryer are cheaper units and are extremely noisy. But that's a minor thing. Be careful about the cab companies that the hotel recommends, and do your own homework on researching cab rates. We made a 1.5 trip to the Citiwalk with a cab company the front desk recommended, and it was $10 one way. Probably could've found a better deal ourselves. In fact, we simply walked back to the hotel after a night at the Citiwalk, and it's a nice walk. The other gripe was that breakfast isn't included in the price of the hotel, so you have to pay for overpriced danishes and muffins. Go somewhere else for breakfast options.

I was awakened at midnight by a phone call from a male hotel staff member who said he was calling to make sure that someone was actually staying in my unit. (??) On the final night of my stay, my key card would not open my door. I took it to the front desk and was given another which also failed to open my door. After my third trip to the desk a security guard accompanied me to my room with an electronic device which also failed to open my door. A gentleman from housekeeping was called and between the two of them and the electronic device, I was able to gain entry to my room. Also, on one visit to the gym, I found the door was locked (early afternoon). I had visited the gym the day before and found it to be well equipped. The pool area was great!

This hotel caters for everything you need they even give you washing up liquid, clothes detergent ,dish washing powder, tea towels ,cloths ,coffee and fresh towels everyday when you require them. The kitchen is the best equipped i have ever stayed in . Its rare to find a hotel that actually give you a proper mug to drink your morning cuppa from . The pool area is spotless clean with staff constantly put out fresh towels. The immediate area is quiet but 5 minutes up the road is tgi friday and abc supermarket. ABC supermarket is a ripoff but walmart have opened a new store just left off sandlake road passed mc donalds. Publix supermarket is down by premium outlets so if you get the linx 42 to premium outlet the bus man if asked will tell you which stop to get off its just one stop before the premiums .

The norm standard of accommodation is average however this hotel is fantastic value for money, the rooms are great and the pool was one you want to chill out by - which isn't often the case at neighbouring hotels. We stayed for 9 nights, and then returned a few days later for a further 3 nights. Only concern at start was the lack of room safes - we did enquire and were advised as a new hotel safes were on order and if made us feel better to hide valuables around the room. Following a break for a few nights we returned to the hotel for 3 nights. Unfortunately on the 2nd day of our stay a item of jewellery went missing - it was a new purchase and had been in a box inside a suitcase in our bedroom. The box was left but the contents gone! Initially the query was dealt with by one member of staff who had been fantastic our whole stay. Unfortunately this wasn't the person able to deal with our issue and its at this stage the customer service provided was questionable. Our last day was spent at the hotel which wasn't our plan and had my requests been actioned in the morning when I asked then our day wouldn't have been wasted. No apology or acknowledgement for our wasted day was mentioned by the hotel - a bit of empathy would have been good. I was unable to file a police report until the hotel had followed basic procedures and these didn't happen till late on. I never expected to get any monies back for the missing item however I was disappointed and still am that the hotel didn't provide good customer service. Communication was minimal and had to do all the chasing. I'm reasonable and didn't want poor service over a couple of days to bring down our entire stay which until then had been fantastic. So I highlighted my concerns to the hotel via correspondence however they haven't been acknowledged and just confirms their poor level of customer service. Unfortunately I wont be staying in the hotel again as the situation could have been handled better - even acknowledging my concerns would have appeased me. Never once did I feel they went the extra mile with the whole situation. Its a horrible feeling to think that someone has been through your belongings and you should havent to go through that anywhere especially on holiday and it would be good for management to think what service they would expect if it happened to them. I would recommend this hotel but a word to the wise be very careful about the valuables you take & purchase as the hotel is yet to have room safes and through our experience the management made it very clear they take no responsibility when things do go missing!", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Florida", "Title": "\u201cA Wounderful Hotel With A Great Price.\u201d", "Author": "filpo2007", "ReviewID": "UR29913064", "Content": "I stayed at this wounderful hotel In April 30,2009-May 03,2009 and words could not explain how happy and pleased I am was with the stay.
