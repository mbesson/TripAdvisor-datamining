The staff were very welcoming and the hotel was an excellent choice - very modern, clean, quiet and bright. We had booked a superior room (101) which was a good size by Paris standards, particularly large bathroom and king bed and an large walk in wardrobe and desk area. There was a small flatscreen TV in the room with mostly French channels but did have Sky News. The room was very clean, great decor and bedlinen and situated just 2 mins walk from Argentine metro so really well positioned. A few steps away at the end of the road are some typical Parisien restaurants which are great for breakfast (priced from Euro 7.50), reasonably priced casual meals and coffee etc. and a buzzy atmosphere. There is also a very nice patisserie there so don't take breakfast at the hotel at Euros 18! The hotel is on a very quiet street so feels nice and tucked away, but the Arc de Triomphe is just 5 minutes walk away and the fabulous walk down the Champs Elysees so close. The Metro so easily accessible from the hotel and a very direct line for the main areas but Paris is a great city to walk around and the walk to the Eiffel is around 25 minutes and the same to the Tuilleries. All in all I highly recommend this hotel for a city break. We got a great deal on Expedia so watch out for deals as the rack rate of 270 Euros a night is definitely over the top....as most other things are in this wonderful but expensive city!", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warrington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel but tiny rooms\u201d", "Author": "Andrew B", "ReviewID": "UR124858034", "Content": "This hotel is excellent.

From reading about hotels in the city and the room sizes being small we were very happy to find the room was a good size. We stayed in room 602. The room was clean and had an ensuite bathroom with the toilet in a separate room. It was a bit rough around the edges and the wall paint was coming off in places and some of the sockets in the room did not work but don't let this put you off the hotel was in a great location and very near the metro to enable you to travel round Paris easy. It is also very near the stops for the buses to the airport. The only tips I have are to think twice about the room service we ordered a few things that looked very appealing on the menu as we were very hungry after a long plane delay in the uk and a later than planned arrival. What was delivered looked and tasted .. Well ...cardboard like ! We got stung for the privilege .. 68 euros! There is an amazing bakery literally at the end of the street the food costs next to nothing and was amazing ! All fresh and the staff were all very helpful. The other tip I have is to make your requests very clear to the reception at the hotel. My partner and I wanted to watch the Moulin rouge but the reception booked us in to the wrong show and told us the wrong time! They did refund us but if u only have one night to go then I suggest you do double check or go and buy tickets direct from the place! Overall we had a great time in Paris and the hotel was satisfactory for our needs as it was just a base. I would not recommend this if you want a weekend where you intend to spend long periods in the hotel as I would have been very disappointed had this have been the case.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice boutique hotel...cleanliness could improve...\u201d", "Author": "DannyKaz", "ReviewID": "UR122570806", "Content": "Nice small hotel, frendly staff, located away from touristy area but but still just few minutes form Arc de Triomphe and shopping av.des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.

The hotel is very central,there is a metro five minutes from the hotel,we used it quite alot it is very cheap roughly 3 euros for the two of us to get anywhere is Paris. It is about a 10min walk to the Champs Elysees from the hotel! This is where all the shops and restraunts are,it is very busy but really nice to walk down. We bought a two day open top bus tour which was well worth the money - it was hop on hop off,there were four diff routes and you can just jump on and off as you please.

We travelled to the location of our hotel via metro which was easy enough to use once we had got help from the ticketing staff. Hotel: We found the hotel staff to be most helpful and informative and happily answered any questions we asked. They provided us with tea and coffee making facilities on request. Our hotel room was on the second floor which looked out onto the quiet side street. We were pleasantly surprised by the size of the room as we were aware French hotel rooms are known to be small. The bed was comfortable and the room clean and airy and made up each day. We had no trouble sleeping. The modern bathroom had a decent shower and it was lovely being provided with bathrobes for the duration of our stay. Location: The location was ideal - just a five minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe and 10 - 15 minutes from the Champs-Elysees from where we caught the city tour bus (we booked a 2 day pass from home but it is easy enough to pay once you have arrived in Paris at roughly the same cost). Food: We ususally purchased our brunch from the nearby excellent Pastisserie opposite the main road and ate out in restaurants in the evening. Be prepared though - eating and drinking (including soft drinks and teas and coffee) out in Paris does not come cheap! sightseeing: The 2 day open top bus tours are well worth doing as is the River Seine cruise. There are plenty of sights to see. Be prepared to queue for the Eiffel Tower. Waited in line for approx 1 1/2 hours but it was worth it! If you want to go right to the top you will need to purchase an extra ticket once inside on one of the platforms. The Louvre is massive! As stated previously by other trip advisors, it is very busy inside and can't always get close to the exhibits. The Arc de Triomphe is also worth entering for the view but be prepared for lots of stairs. (I didn't see a lift).

One small complaint about the wifi - I left my luggage on the lat day and when I returned in the evening the staff would not allow me to use the wifi.

Didn't have the breakfasts which seemed a bit overpriced and the dining room full of guests on their computers, but got more of a local feel by purchasing the freshly made baguettes and pastries from the shop at the end of the road and eating in the local gardens and parks. There is a Thai restaurant nearby, gets very crowded and has small tables crammed in, but the food was good. Had a dinner cruise on the Seine, very nice and romantic, try for the price option with a window seat, same menu with slight variations but a better experience.

From Gare Du Nord Station short walk to the Metro and platform 42 on the blue line. Change at Chatelet onto yellow line to Argentine station. Hotel only a few minutes walk away cost 1 euro 70 each on the Metro. Staff very friendly and polite at reception and quick book in as prepaid. Stayed in a standard room which was clean, very comfortable with modern decor .Although the room had air-con still found it warm at night and had to have the window open so did have some early morning street noise with refuge collectors. The fridge came in handy and it was good to have a roomsafe. Did not eat at the hotel therefore cannot comment on the food. From the hotel the Arc de Triomphe was about 5 minutes walk away with the Eiffel Tower about 30 minutes walk away. Supermarket just across the road which was ideal ,along with a bakers ideal for filled baguettes. As a base for our stay in Paris it was an excellent hotel as we were able to get to the main attractions by a combination of leg power and the Metro and you felt safe at night. You do not have to check out until noon and we were allowed to leave our bags in reception which was good. Would recommend this hotel and very satisfied that we chose it for our stay.

The hotel is just by Argentine underground station and just five minutes from Arch de Triomphe. An excellent location. There are lots of businesses around and makes it is slightly out of touriste-ville with better quality and priced restaurants.

Bed was cosy (when in Paris........ah hem) and comfortable. Room was clean and fresh towels. No tea or coffee making facilities in the room though. The location was also very quiet for such a central one - a quiet side street. Didn't eat there as the breakfast was too expensive for what you get - so went to the Boulongerie(?) just down the room for a breakie picnic. There are lots of cafe/bars/brasseries very close bye - we spent \u00a3600 one night on a meal for six at the brasserie (great steaks) one night and then \u00a3150 in the chinese (almost) next door the night. The Chinese was great. Didn't get around to trying the Thia though. Very easy to get the Metro - just hold up the Parisiennes at the ticket machine and someone will help you out. To summarise, the hotel could do with a little freshening up.....very minor.....but great place and staff really made the trip worthwhile. We would stay again as great value for money.

We booked a standard double room which was located on the first floor. The hotel is advertised as \"botique\" but I think the only thing really fitting this description is the fact it has stripy wall paper and carpet and is very small. That being said the place was clean, the room was clean, the bathroom was bigger than I expected with a bath and mouted shower over the bath. There wasn't a great deal of pressure from the small showerhead but it was fine for two nights. You get slippers and bath robes and standard toiletries. Air con worked well which is important in summer. The street is quiet so there is no disturbance from the outside. The walls must be quite thin as I often heard people coughing, talking and banging around in their rooms. If you want to be near the night life then this hotel is not for you as you would have to take a cab or the Metro to get close to the river where there seemed to be plenty happening in the evening. A taxi to the river (near Notre dame) was 11 Euros. The pillows were odd, one seemed to be filled with those small pollestyrene balls you get as package filling but as there were two pillows each I used the other one which was fine. The bed was a bit hard though and I did leave with a slightly sore lower back. There is a small fridge in the wardrobe which was surprisingly big - was a walk in style wardrobe - which I didn't expect from the size of the room. Some of that space would be well used for room around the bed. We checked out Sunday afternoon (12 noon check out time) and our train wasn't until 19:15 but the guy at the front desk let us leave our luggage for the day. We even came back after sight-seeing and went to the hotel toilets so we could freshen up after a day walking around in the punishing summer sun. The hotel toilets were clean and has face cloths for drying your hands which you can use to wash / dry your face if you are in the same position as we were. The guy at the desk was always very friendly and helpful. It did seem expensive though (300 Euros for two nights) given the size of the room. The room is fine for a weekend but any longer and we would have needed more space. Bring a print out with you of the name of the street as none of the taxi drivers we used recognised the hotel name or the street name (rue Duret). The hotel is located on a quiet street. The Arc de Triomphe is visible from the main road just up from the hotel and is within walking distance (around 15 mins). The hotel is 2 mins walk from Metro line No. 1 which is the line for Eiffel Tower, Louvre, Arc de Triompe, Champes Elysee. This is the easiest way to see the sights.

It's a walk to most of the tourist sights, but the subway is practically right outside, and when you return to your hotel, you get the feeling you are in the real Paris, and about as upscale as metro-Paris can get. I remember reading somewhere a complaint about the Duret was the lack of restaurants in the vicinity... That is COMPLETELY untrue. Over the four days we stayed there in September, we ate at a different place at every meal, that's 12+ meals, and walked to each in less than 10 minutes... and I mean GRRREAT food! That said the one complaint I would voice would be the hotel's restaurant recommendations.

The room was very clean, and the high ceilings and large window helped make it feel light and spacious. The hotel is on a side street so it was nice and quiet too. The only slightly annoying thing was that the air conditioning is set to only heat the rooms in the winter, so you can't cool them down. We found sleeping in the heat difficult, but opening the window solved the problem! The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk from the nearest metro station (Argentine) which is on Line 1 and goes straight through the city centre. It's also no more than a 10 minute walk from the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees and less than 30 mins walk to the Eiffel Tower.

The Duret may have the same stars as the Littre but it was superior. This place is fantastic as long as you arent after an old style Parisian experience as it is a trendy boutique affair. It does the boutique thing in a stylish, not garish, way. Its located 5-10 mins walk from the Arc de Trimophe but dont let that put you off (i) noise wise (its set off the main road); and (ii)tack wise (its sufficienlty away from the touristy side of that area). Argentine Metro is 2-3 mins walk away. By the way, if like me you think the location looks like it was a little outside the real centre of town (ie its NW of the Arc-dT and near the end of the metro line), then do not worry: its not really, its a great location. Sure its a bit of a walk back into say the Louvre area but thats the way to see this City: on foot (and anyway within 10-15 mins of leaving the hotel you can be there by Metro). The staff were 100% excellent: an example being that I checked out of the Littre (again, not because its bad but for the boring reasons mentioned above!) and turned up at 1030 hoping to drop my bag off....instead the receptionist ensured I had a room I could check into there and then.....this set the tone, nothing was too much trouble and the professionalism of the woman on the desk was A1. Nice little bar area to relax with the ample papers (no tabloids!) they provide. Our room (the first on the price level) was small but clean with superior bathroom products by the way (not the mass produced usual hotel stuff) ONLY gripe (and it didnt bother me but it will some) and this is a word of warning to Duret should they read this, is that there was a LITTLE evidence of wear and tear (eg small chip off the wardrobe door, a little sucffing on the wall). BUT please NB this was slight and not enought to make you think about checking other hotels: its just a warning to them to keep their eye on the ball and ensure this lovely hotel doesnt slip (Room 204 by by the way Duret!). The street (Rue Duret) is charming with a handful of tasteful shops and a couple of ok-ish bars/cafes back at the end of the road near the main drag. I took a nice walk left out of the hotel over the main road and up to 'Victor Hugo' metro where there is a a nice buzz and a couple of good cafes for breakfast....its then only about 10 mins to the Trocadero and a great view of the Eiffel Tower, so a good launch pad for walking back into the real centre of town.", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "fjg971", "ReviewID": "UR5880424", "Content": "Excellent boutique hotel.

It is clean and safe and there are many convenient businesses ie, ATM, bakery, flower shop, produce stand, etc. The walk to the Argentine metro on line 1 is 3 minutes. You can get anywhere in Paris very quickly. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel preferring to get morning pastry and chocolate on the way to the metro on the corner of Rue Duret and Grand Armee. One day we walked to the Arc and down Champs Elysee. It is breathe taking. Everyone working at the hotel was gracious and willing to give advise and directions. We especially appreciated all Christine did to make our stay in Paris memorable. We requested and were given a non smoking room. I did smell a faint odor but only in the middle of the night through the vent in the bathroom. Otherwise there was not other problem. They have a small refrigerator in the room actually a mini bar. It was not completely full and we did cool some of our water bottles in this way. Over all it was an excellent choice. I would definitely stay again.", "Date": "May 21, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Duret", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197458-Reviews-Hotel_Duret-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$200 - $360*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">30, rue Duret</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75116</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "197458", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/eb/8e/0c/lobby-lounge-room.jpg"}}
