The service is top notch, from the front door staff in the motor lobby to the warm front desk staff eagerly waiting to take care of you. I was upgraded to a very large room with a nice view of the city. I'm a Platinum member with Ritz-Carlton, which includes free wireless internet and a room upgrade upon availability. I didn't have time to actually dine or drink at the restaurant and lobby bar, but they were both busy every night. This property is not your standard high rise Ritz-Carlton. It's a former insurance headquarters built many years ago. It blends right into the San Francisco architecture and has a boutique feel, though it's a fairly large property.

We had an extended stay, and the staff at the Club Level made us feel like we were at home. Every year we come back, we hope that things have not changed and that we can expect the same service and people, and that was the case yet again. Great: The Club Level is really outstanding, better than any other Ritz we have stayed at. The food is excellent and, as mentioned, the service is amazing. I really enjoy the atmosphere, where it is not done in some overly modern fashion that removes any warmth, as say the LA Live Ritz. Also, after trying Parallel 37, the food is great, and the remodel is well done. Good: Well, it really is only passable, and that is the room service menu, not what you would call good food. The menu is not creative at all, basic Marriott style, and the quality is sub par. Because we have a small child, we ate off this menu more than a few times, and I just could not understand how the food could not measure up, when the Club food is great, and so is the restaurant food. Needs Improvement: Hmm, they call it a Spa? I guess you should wonder when there are no pictures of it on the web site, that is a tip that there really is no spa. I was sitting in a dingy hallway, in my robe, ready for a treatment, and people were coming and going, as there was no lounge area. The treatment room was right there, accessed from the hallway, and you got to see who used the room right before you, the clean up, and then also the nice couple that was going to use it when I got out, they looked surprised to see me coming out. Okay, couple this with the smelly locker room, showers that are so hot that you can't use them (no cold water at all) and the cigarette butt that was on the carpet floor below my locker and you get the general idea. Yes, that did happen. I hate to be negative about this, but how can it be great hotel, and advertize a spa, with these facilities, or lack there of? The management was very attentive and did credit me for the treatment when I noted the deficiencies, which was nice. Transition to the final bill review upon check out, and my bill was not correct. They charged for Valet, which was included, and I also had a 3 night package, two back to back, and that was not correct, as they billed the entire amount. When I noted this, they fixed it, but then only credited back the cheapest night, not the package rate, so it had to be done again. I thought this part was really not acceptable, The guest should not be required to find large billing errors, or risk overpayment. As noted, the rooms are a bit worn and dated, but hopefully they will be updated soon.

I may be biased beacuse I usually dont stay in SF and not used to the small size hotels. The service is typical Ritz and I say that in a good way. My one complaint would be the doormen didnt make me feel invited and seem to spend most of their time with someone who may give them a large tip. The Room: Small.....They do the best they can with the space they have but as mentioned before a renovation is in order and I fully understand the cost and logistics to keep the hotel open during renovation is a nightmare. We just returned from Rosewood Hotel Georgia in Vancouver and they also have limited space but Ritz should use them as an example. Fitness: No pool and there is a large area for yoga and stretching but again the same theme of being small with limited equipement. Spa: Didnt use it but the area always smells nice and the staff working the area was very nice. Tea and coffee is available near the spa. Restaurant: We ate there twice for breakfast and it was very good. Our waiter on the first day was very nice and catered to our daughter and our friends kids very well. My wife had the buffett and she liked it but maybe a bit overpriced but the quality was definetely good. The kids french toast covered with cereal was a hit with the kids. The second day breakfst was a Tuesday and our waited looked like he was in training. Not as a fun an experience as the first( i wish I could remember his name to give him credit).

The room was really nice (junior executive club level suite) - to be honest, a little tired but they are all being renovated in the near future from what I hear.

First the rooms service menu is a joke. There are few options and the food is just not very good, at prices that make you want to gag. Secondly the spa is not a spa. They advertise spa services and claim that the spa has been renovated. In fact the only thing they have done is remove the pool and make the fitness area larger. One entire room is full of dirty yoga mats, a floor that was never replaced and looks like a cheap dirty gym, not a spa There is no appropriate waiting area for spa services, nothing that makes you feel like you are actually in a spa at all.

It may not have be Cristal but was a nice gesture to welcome incoming guests. Every Ritz Carlton should do this. Check in was a breeze and the agent was friendly and expeditious and I was in my room in less than 5 minutes. I was in a Club Deluxe room. From what I noticed the Superior/Deluxe rooms are not tremendous but not small either but more importantly well maintained. The bathroom is a very important factor for me when I rate a hotel. Since it is a older building, the standard rooms did have a shower/tub combo and I do prefer separates but, what I did notice was the marble was actually in very good condition and shiny. Lots of hotels have marble bathrooms and never maintain or polish the marble and it ends up looking old, spotted and dirty (Ritz Carlton Marina del Rey) but not at RC SFO. The marble was clean and shiny. as were all marble areas throughout the hotel. In addition, the Club lounge definitely seemed superior to other RC Club lounges. Their offerings were extensive, offerings were nearly continuous, so there were no long gaps of in between times and every single club concierge could not bend over backwards enough to be more accommodating. I spent most of my stay in the club lounge and noticed that the Ladies & Gentlemen truly take pride in their jobs/hotel and understand the philosophy of Ritz Carlton. I took a loot at the gym and it looked like there were ample machines/weights. The SPA was a little odd shaped and the layout may not be of a typical SP but nonetheless seemed acceptable.

I have anew business matter that will take me to San Francisco every month or so for the next year so was looking forward to staying at the Ritz again. I stayed there last month and was shocked (I hadn't realized that Marriott bought them and don't know if that is the reason for the changes). When I arrived I was stunned -- they'd just completed a major \"renovation\" of the bar, the restaurant and the main lounge off the entry area. The \"new\" areas are dreadful -- the main lounge area was a shock -- it's a bizarre mix of disharmonious colors and furniture design that can't be explained. I guess the closest description would be \"Clockwork Orange come to the Ritz.\" The bar has a red light glow, the walls are dark charcoal, the chairs look like they were plucked from a Disney ride, the fabrics are in a visual war with each other, and for people who like comfort when they relax for a couple of hours with some friends over drinks, if you like your chairs at rigid 90 degree angles that leave you with back pain, you'll love it. I can't imagine an uglier room, and we spent some time retrying to conceive of a contemporary design concept that could explain what they did. We failed -- no design concept was apparent. The new restaurant lives up to the maxim: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The closest visual analogy I could think of was one of those all-you-can-east buffet rooms in a glitzy Las Vegas Hotel. And the old bar, with its comfortable cozy chairs and warm colors has been replaced by something resembling a waiting room in one of those airport club lounges, only most of the latter are more inviting. For perspective, I am not a big fan of the Ritz Carlton's more classic look of repro American furniture, so it's not as if they replaced something I loved. But this particular Ritz, with its admirable location and nice scale, was a good place, and now its awful. I used to spend hours meeting friends and clients in the discreet old bar and the lounge. During my 5 days I didn't spend a minute -- well, one exception, when I went to the bar adjacent the restaurant for a bar snack, I couldn't find a single thing on the menu that I wanted, and I'll usually go for anything. Another defect? The room haven't been touched. Yes, they're clean, but they are very dated and boring. What was nice 10-20 years ago is just plain dull. And the one thing I always intensely disliked at the Ritz -- well, they've kept that -- the staff is intrusive, indiscreet and sometimes just plain aggressive. Somehow, the Ritz is able to find perfectly nice and motivated staff and train them to intrude on the clientele at every opportunity. When you come down in the morning on your way to the entrance to find a taxi, you run a gauntlet of insincerely, robotically programmed staff yelling out your name -- I don't need 6 \"good morning Mr. X\" greetings when I walk 30 yards to the entrance. Whenever I stayed at the Ritz, if it was for a business deal that needed to be kept discreet, I always had my clients check in with fake names to avoid having their names shouted for every passing journalist to hear and leak to the Wall Street Journal.

Both the Ritz and the Fairmont are at the top of a big hill so there is no escaping this if you want to stay at the better hotels. The beds at the hotel are so comfortable that you will have a tough time getting going in the morning. There truly won't be one thing that the staff neglects as far as wants and needs.

They did not bother to get Back with me , though they promised to. 2) my car was parked by the valet service.

He assured me they would have a look at the video and call me right away. Well they did not call me. I had to call them after a long wait. No sense of urgency by staff . Anyway - the first verbal report I was given was that they could not tell if car was already damaged. The next day I asked and they said they could sort of see the damage when I originally pulled in, but they could not really tell. I asked to view the tape . They said sure, but then refused to let me view the tape. The following day, a third person called me a d said they could see it , but with glare. The whole thing was ridiculous. In fact it got more absurd . The day of my departure , the manager proposed to credit the parking fee. I was like , sadly management is not kidding. I could not care less about a parking credit. I only wanted the damaged car addressed if in fact my car was undamaged when I checked in . Incidentally - management lasted provided a photo of the damage as proof. However , the photo they sent me as proof - was the photo the valet took once I reported the damage.

I will start by saying I had relatively expectations of the hotel after staying at a number of Marriott and Ritz hotels, and also reading the reviews. Our experience unfortunately was not of the same caliber other guests have written about. I will start by saying this is a beautifully restored property in a desirable location (top of hill), near shopping, Chinatown, etc. The issues: \u2022 Hotel rooms need refreshing. Wallpaper is starting to curl. Carpets stained. Just not what I would expect at a Ritz. \u2022 No Bulgari bath products, relatively small bathroom (one vanity). Reminded me of a more traditional Marriott room \u2022 Construction noise. The weekend we stayed they were doing a significant renovation on the dining room. This not only impacted the lobby area, but unfortunately the room (and nearby rooms) above that area. This was not relayed to us upon making the reservation, nor was it mentioned upon check-in. The jackhammers started before 9am on a Sunday. \u2022 Customer service at front desk was clearly not what we expected. Maybe we just hit hotel on the wrong weekend, but a hotel of this caliber should always have good service. \u2022 Called several times to get an answer. Also, when I went to front desk to get a copy of the bill at check-out, I noted another guest discussing how loud his room was. Apparently on the courtyard, and had a lot of noise from activities taking place. He had asked the person at the desk for a change in room, but appeared to be rudely cut off by the individual, stating that the rooms on the street side are actually much noisier. They went back and forth arguing until the guest said just to change the room and walked away. This was concerning as I had never seen a member of the Ritz staff treat a guest in this fashion (essentially telling them to be quiet so they could get their point across). \u2022 Valet- took over a half hour for them to pull car around, after calling. There was no one waiting in front of us and it was the middle of the day.", "Date": "September 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Apopka, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThe ritz carlton san francisco\u201d", "Author": "debralynn2010", "ReviewID": "UR118622342", "Content": "Very historic property!

First off, when we arrived at the porte cochere to check the car with the valet, we were immediately approached by a bellhop, presumably to take our luggage and port our car to the garage. The bellhop had a different idea. Rather than assist my female companion with her luggage, he stood at the trunk of the car engaging her in a battle of wills to see who would ultimately extract the luggage (2 standard size suitcases). To her credit, she waited him out and he begrudgingly lifted the luggage out. I was wrestling with the duffle bags in the backseat while this exchange took place. We then were directed to the check in area where we were greeted by a friendly face. Our check in was handled professionally but unremarkably. There was no escort to our rooms. Nor were we offered any sort of refreshment at the front desk. I arrived at my room to find it in proper order. Average cleanliness and adequately maintained. The furniture showed its age (couch was worn in areas and chairs were slightly stained). The room contained a nicely stocked mini-fridge and Bvlgari toiletries (strongly scented and more feminine in smell). The pillows were just right, the mattress worn and covered with what I presume to be a bedwetting preventive cover which sounded and felt like a pamper. It crackled through the night and detracted from the sleep experience. My companion confirmed her mattress was similarly fitted with said pamper so I conclude all the beds have this deplorable feature. After check in, we decided to check out the spa for a massage. The spa facilities are small and the lockerroms more gym-like than spa-like. Massage rooms are average. We agreed to meet up in the pool/hottub area after the treatments. To my dismay, after receiving a relaxing massage, I exited the locker area to the wet area to be confronted with 5-6 children under the age of 5 screaming and running around. The children were attended to by a grand mother who yelled not less than 25 times \"no running! Last warning!\". The children did not heed warning and continued their misbehavior. Spa staff did not intervene and at least attempt to maintain a spa-like atmosphere. Our massages were shot and we decided to bail. The hotel should simply call this area the pool area/daycare for lazy parents. It is not a spa atmosphere in the least. There are no \"adults only\" wet areas in the hotel. We then had dinner at The Dining Room (the hotel restaurant). We each selected the chef's tasting menu. The food was outstanding; service was awkward with long delays between courses. The entire presentation took more than three hours. The length of service is less of a critique and more of a warning to plan your timing accordingly. I encountered several staff who were at all times friendly and professional but who lacked refinement. (not addressing me by name, no anticipation of needs, etc). The one exception to this criticism is who I believed to be the head bellman I encountered when checking out, who was outstanding. Overall my treatment during the stay was on par with a Hyatt or Marriott; entirely disappointing for the cost and expectations.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Rafael, California", "Title": "\u201cSo disappointed with this Ritz!\u201d", "Author": "MelissaBradley", "ReviewID": "UR114947372", "Content": "Writing this review makes me sad; so I most likely won't go into all the details that I could. First let me start off by saying that we booked about 20 rooms here for our family, friends and ourselves and had our holiday party in the ballroom. We picked this location because I had a baby shower here in the past in the tea room and was very pleased with how well that went. However this event did not go well and the service was horrific. Let me start with the good, then I'll get into the bad and the down right ugly. The Good: This hotel is a historic building, I believe it was formerly a banking building or an insurance building back in the day and it has a lot of gorgeous restored details. That is why we thought it would be perfect for Christmas as it was so orante and decorative inside and out. It was decorated nicely for christmas with a tree and other garland. The bell man were all generally attentive with a few exceptions. The Bad and The Ugly: The rest of it was horrible. The staff did not remember our names most of the time even though we spent a fortune on the rooms and the party with catering. I could not believe how rude and snobby most of the staff was, especially the front desk and the catering department/ party planners. We also had rooms that offered us terrible views with lots of street noise. There are so many other 5 star hotels in San Francisco that offer amazing views. In fact many of our nearly 200 party goers stayed at other hotels within walking distance at half the price and raved of not only their amazing views but their outstanding service as well. I could go on and on here and probably should but I just can't because it makes me so sad. If it were just my family it would be a different story; but I was hosting a large group and was so terribly disappointed with everything. Even one of my guests had a cell phone, wallet and jacket stolen. Some people crashed our party. I know this for a fact because I saw two men in jeans in our lobby area just outside our ballroom. I asked them who they were with and they didn't have an answer. However they went into our rented room. There was no security in sight. Also, we were overcharged on several accounts but the most blaring was that we were charged for bottled water every time someone just asked for water. I was promised water from tap would be served unless specified. This might seem petty, but it's just a glimpse into the unprofessionalism I experienced all around. I also noticed that it looked like the same bottle of water was being used by a bartender. It was never freshly opened in front of the guests. This led me to believe that it was being refilled with tap water and then poured into a glass when a guest requested water. I would not say this unless I was pretty sure this is what was going on. For the record, I did have this portion of my bill adjusted. I know all of this sounds a little odd for me to observe this level of minutia, but I am a business owner myself and quite an obsessive person about the details. There were more disappointments with the food as well. I have notes form the whole ordeal but I don't feel like digging them up just now. I am writing this review mainly as a comparison to the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay. I gave that hotel five points. This one I am afraid gets one point from me and I believe that is the lowest score I have ever given a hotel. Also, to further my credibility for judgment ability I have owned a business for about 20 years and have hosted hundreds of parties at restaurants and hotels. In fact we generally host 2-5 parties at hotels and dozens at restaurants each year. This hotel was by far the worst experience ever; so many other details I just can't bare to rehash; which makes me so sad because we were hoping to give our guests such a memorable event. We ironically had picked the Ritz over hotels with better menus and better views because of it's world wide reputation for class and service. We had hosted an event at the Half Moon Bay Ritz property and had a 5 star experience there and expected the same in San Francisco. Unfortunately not all Ritz Carlton hotels uphold the reputation that they should. If you thought this review was helpful please let me know.

However, you pay for luxury and luxury and adequate service are the benchmark then. I had mixed feelings about the service, the check-in and check-out procedure, the Internet billing, the Spa... Rooms are fine, nice furniture, carpet shows wear but that's a problem in all hotels if they are not brand new windows don't close that well so make sure you got the heating going but otherwise no complaints. Service was very good by the doormen - couldn't be better. A glass of Champagne was offered to me upon check-in and I certainly appreciate such. But check-in area itself is very small, there are only two working there so you have to wait for 20 minutes for check-in which is simply not acceptable. I saw people waiting at check-in, check-out all weekend; and, yes, property was fully booked. Check-in was ok, nobody showed me to the room, ok. But then it took almost an hour for the luggage to arrive and I had to call before it finally did arrive. The guy was apologetic and it's probably more a lack of staff than anything else. Again, not acceptable for a hotel of this standard. Tried to contact room service and frontdesk - busy all the time and when I finally got through the girl was less than friendly - very stressed out. Again, not acceptable for a hotel of this standard. That hotel of this standard charge when Courtyard doesn't is an old story and very deplorable. As long as they get away with it they will - am waiting for the luxury htel chain that stops and will patronise them... Anyway, I did connect with two different devices and got charged for both... They promised to remove the charge but did not. Tried to call in and talk to their billing departement. Told - again quite harshly - to call back later as they're busy. Again, not acceptable for a hotel of this standard. Went to SPA - booked Aromatherapy massage - girls insisted I had booked deep tissue - ok be it - an experience but it did hurt. But again, it's not acceptable for a hotel of this standard. Service in breakfast area was wonderful I have to say. So was the bar and the dining was simply delightful. All in all a mixed bag.

After an hour and half and several calls, the front desk offered to change our room, but by then it was pushing 4 a.m., and we had to get up at 6:30 for our flights. The hotel should have at worst shushed the neighbors, at best kicked them out or changed their room. In the absence of doing that, we should have been comped for the last night. I emailed the hotel manager at the end of our vacation, and one of the managers had a representative of security call me. A situation handled poorly, but to security's credit, they will hopefully have a protocol in place to deal with this kind of issue properly, should it occur again.

My husband and I have stayed at a few Intercontinentals and decided to see if the Ritz lived up to its 5 star rating! Location is decent just a few blocks away from Union Square. While the hotel building has really great architecture, it is not very tall so you really don't get any view of the skyline from any room. The lobby is quite opulent with marble everywhere you look. It makes me think of \"old money\" rich rather than the more trendy Intercon. My husband had dropped his bags earlier in the day and we checked in later that night. They brought his bags to the room but oops, only brought 1 instead of 2 bags. They had to go back and retrieve the second one. Our room was on the 5th floor which is only 1 floor above the lobby. It was somewhat close to the elevators and also the doors to the rooms seemed very close together. At night, when our neighbors would open the doors to their rooms, I kept thinking someone was coming in to ours! Also we could hear some street noises outside the window though we didn't have our windows open. Unfortunately, we also appeared to have been put in a wedding block so when the other guests came back late at night, we got to hear their loud voices floating through the halls. It only woke me up once (I was beat!) but apparently my husband was up all night. The rooms were nice with flat screen tv and dvd player. Also an iHome which was great for plugging in the iPod. However I will point out we moved to the JW Marriott down the street after the Ritz and their flat screen tv was twice as big AND there was Bose theater system. We appeared to have received a turn down service on Fri night (we stayed 2 nights) with the blanket turned down and classical music playing. We didn't receive that on Sat night though even though we came back somewhat late. We did enjoy the complimentary bottles of water and coffee maker in the room. I always enjoy the little extras in the bathroom. In this case, my favorite was the ring holder. For a 5 star hotel, I had really hoped for more though like some fancy soaps and giant plush towels. Aside from the embroidered logos, the towels were smallish and scratchy. I didn't even bother swiping the shampoos and soaps! Some other reviews talk of fancy Bulgari soaps... must only be on the Club Level. Also, water pressure wasn't great but at least the bathroom was spacious. Some reviewers talk of outstanding service but I thought it was average. Yes, the concierge gave us maps... that's what they are supposed to do! Sometimes the doors were opened for us when we came/went but sometimes they were too busy talking to each other to help us out and certainly no one greeted us by name or went out of their way to say hello. I was glad to have at least tried out the Ritz and thankfully, I was not paying for the room. I think in general though I felt my stays at other less expensive hotels were just as good. For example, Hampton Inn has really comfy beds and fresh baked cookies with free breakfast and even Holiday Inn's nowadays have updated marble bathrooms! At least if we had a #1 location and awesome views, I could see the reason for the expense but this time, I couldn't justify it.

This time we decided to treat ourselves to 2 club level rooms. Things got off to a rather shaky start when we arrived to find that the hotel was overbooked and so our rooms were not longer available. However the duty manager, Andy, came up with a rather brilliant alternative - he put us in the presidential suite! We just had to wait until Tom Cruise checked out! This was a seriously gorgeous room with a massive balcony complete with numerous loungers and tables and chairs. The room even has a grand piano and full kitchen. If I were to nit pick it would only be the fact that we had wanted us all to have proper beds to sleep in but this room only has one king bed. One of the children slept on a sofabed and the other on a rollaway in the lounge area. Both were comfortable but not the \"proper\" beds we had booked. However this room more than made up for that minor irritation. Plenty of hanging space for clothes, an enormous master bath surrounded by candles and a full dining room. Shame we did not know anyone in San Francisco - we could have had quite a party in that space! The best, best bit though is the club level lounge. If you can afford to to it, the you should experience it. It is quite the best club lounge we have ever been to. The concerieges on the desk there are incredibly helpful and friendly. The food is amazing and plenty of it. There are soft drinks and tea and coffee available all the time, along with amazing fresh baked cookies. The breakfast selection is extensive and delicious and from early evening there is a huge array of drinks (including cocktails and champagne) with fantastic snacks available to enjoy. It really does have the feel of an exclusive club, down to the fact that only people on the club level floors can access it. Your room key has to be put into a slot in the lift to there. The main hotel is in great shape still. The main rooms are beautiful and imposing. The concerieges on the desk downstairs are a mine of information and suggested some great restaurants for us. It is an easy walk downhill to the huge array of amazing shops in San Francisco. Little more tiring on the way back up though. Both times I have stayed I have been to a flamboyant and very interesting man called Bibo for a shampoo and blowdry. You should go just for the experience of meeting him. Lovely man, full of energy and joie de vivre. Not cheap but he does a good job. His salon is a short walk from the hotel. Well done Ritz Carlton.

There was a DVD player which was very appreciated! Kids really enjoyed the indoor pool and I enjoyed the jacuzzi after a day of trekking up the SF hills. I would not go back there with children again. Perhaps I was hyper-sensitive about my rambunctious boys, but we just didn't fit in. There is definitely snobbery in the air; down-to-earth, the Ritz is not. There is a balance between welcoming hospitality that does not compromise quality - and an overdone level of \"service\" that is forced down by management rather than a genuine expression. The Ritz on the Nob was the latter. Parking to the tune of $71 a day is ludicrous. Unless they were going to spit-shine my car daily, perform a tune-up, and leave a chocolate on the driver's seat, there is no way I was going to throw that kind of money down the drain (or a cement garage). So....I parked at St. Mary's Square just a block down the way, where they charge $32/day - but if you go on the weekend and time it just right, you'll only pay $7 for Saturday and $7 for Sunday.

The Four Seasons, W, Intercontinental or many of the city's lovely boutique properties are certainly a better option for both room quality and attention to detail.

We confirmed our reservation a couple days prior and advised the hotel of this. Upon check in, we received a specially made music CD reminiscent of the music for the birthday year, however it was off by 20 years! We mentioned this to the receptionist, but she laughed and did nothing to correct it. We found this most interesting because my husband is a Marriott Gold member (Platinum for many years) so they his bio already on file. Once in the room, we were treated with the usual friendly service, but once the bellhop left, so did the concern for the guest. Pros: 1. Excellent housekeeping. We tipped the housekeeper because not only was the room cleaned promptly and efficiently in the morning, the evening turndown service was good, but see Cons. 2. Location. There is a trolley stop right outside the hotel, which is nice if you are tired of walking up and down the hills. If you're a morning exerciser, you will find how close Chinatown and Little Italy are from the hotel for your morning stroll/run. 3. Room furnishing. While the room was small, it was comfortable and clean. The furniture was positioned in the typical hotel format, but the pieces were better than average hotel grade. The sheets, pillows, linens, fabrics were all of better quality. 4. Quick valet. Cons: 1. Turndown service. When the room was turned down, it was great. However, I'm not sure why RC thought that their guests preferred late service. Consistently, the turndown service was very late in the evening. One night we had already returned and retired for the evening only to hear a knock at the door at 11pm by the housekeeper to come in. She was surprised when we refused a couple times because we were already in our PJs. Very odd! 2. Customer service. When you call down to the Concierge desk in the morning for assistance on your rental car, you are put on hold for 18 min. Yes, we timed it as we vigorously were on another phone and online trying to resolve the situation with Hertz. I decided to go down to the lobby to speak with the Concierge desk in person. When no one was there, I asked the receptionist what was going on. She stated that the Concierge doesn't come in until 9am! Think this would have been communicated somehow through their telephone system or hotel operator? Overall, our the property was very nice, considering it is a very old building in a weather environment that can be hard on structures. However, customer service was hot at the beginning, addressing you by name as you checked in, but sharply declined to a cool indifference once they charged your card and checking out would be too much of a hassle.

We were thrilled when we found a great package on Expedia that included two nights at the Ritz and airfare. I've never stayed at a Ritz Carlton, but have stayed at comparable hotels, including the Mandarin Oriental, so I expected the same level of service that one would expect from a luxury hotel. When I booked the trip, I selected a room with two double beds, and the confirmation that later received indicated that we had indeed reserved that type of room. Upon arrival however, the person at the front desk told us that they didn't have anymore rooms with two double beds, only rooms with one king bed. I replied that I didn't reserve a room with one bed, and asked if there was anything else she could do. After a couple of back and forths, she replied that she would be happy to have a cot brought up to the room, so that we could have an extra bed. My friend immediately said no. Being offered at cot at the Ritz Carlton???? That's like paying for a luxury room and being told that you have to sleep on the couch. Obviously, our conversation with her was going nowhere, so I asked to speak with the manager. He informed us that they didn't have anymore rooms with two double beds. I showed him the printed confirmation, and after looking a bit flustered, he replied that rooms booked on Expedia cannot be guaranteed. He said that we needed to call after making the reservation to confirm that we could get the actual room we had booked. After more back and forths, he finally replied that he indeed did have a room with two double beds, but it was on the 1st floor. I said that although that wasn't my preference, if that was the best he could do, then I guess we have no choice. After yet more back and forths, he finally replied that a room on the 7th floor would be available at 2:00. Note that we had arrived early, at 11:30, and were certainly not expecting to check in until later. We simply wanted to check our bags until the room was ready, and in the meantime walk around a bit. I said that was great. I thanked him many times for his help, but he never once acknowledged my appreciation. Also note, that I was at all times during this transaction quite calm and courteous. I never got nasty, but also wasn't willing to back down. Also, why did I have to jump through hoops to get a room the I had (a) reserved in the first place and (b) would be available later that day anyway. The whole experience left a very bad taste in my mouth. The room itself was fine. Clean for the most part, although we came back later in the day to find a strange comb, etc., sitting on the nightstand. The wallpaper was peeling in several places, and housekeeping kept forgetting to clear the used coffee from the maker and replenish the bar with new supplies. Overall, not what I would expect from a luxury hotel. I won't be staying at a Ritz Carlton again, especially when there are so many other great hotels that offer better rooms and phenomenal service. I guess they just didn't want to deal with customers who got a great rate on Expedia.

It is a handsome building in a good location, but several annoyances make us wonder whether it's time to change our allegiance to the Ritz brand. We had wanted to stay at the San Francisco Ritz for some time and booked a one-bedroom suite on the Club level so that breakfast, lunch and snacks would be readily available in the Club lounge, primarily for our kids (easier than going to a restaurant for every meal). When making the reservation I was very specific that there would be four of us in the suite, stated the ages of our kids, and explained that we needed a pullout couch for one child and a rollaway for the other. I was told the nightly rate for the suite when I reserved, and nothing was said about any extra charges due to the number of people in the suite (keep reading). First problem: after confirming three times in advance that our suite would have a separate pullout couch and a rollaway bed in the living room, AND that they would be made up and ready when we arrived because we were getting in late, we were taken to a suite with no pullout couch at all and no rollaway in sight. After a couple of phone calls, we were finally moved to a one-bedroom suite that met the description of what I had reserved, but it was very late and we were exhausted. It wasn't a pleasant beginning to our stay. Next problem: upon reading the Club level \"welcome letter\", we learned for the first time that only three people per suite could partake of the Club lounge food and beverage; any additional guests would have to pay $50 per day. At no time during the reservation process was this mentioned to me despite my specifically advising the reservations personnel that there would be four guests in the one-bedroom suite. This additional charge therefore effectively raised our nightly room rate by $50 per night, to a rate we had not agreed to. We immediately discussed this with the Club manager and the reservations manager, and asked that someone get back to us with their determination on the matter. No one ever did, but upon our checkout, the $50 per day additional charge had been included in our bill. On this point, it's the principle of the thing. If that's their policy, they should tell you when you make your reservation. We had paid a significant additional amount to stay on the Club floor already, and ended up paying $200 extra on top of that (for a 12-year-old girl who doesn't eat much). Housekeeping problem: on two out of the four days of our visit, our room was never made up. We left the hotel before 9 a.m. each day and returned just before dinner time, to find no clean towels and the suite uncleaned. Each time this resulted in housekeeping rushing to our suite to make it up at the same time that we were trying to shower and get changed to go out to dinner. It is a mystery to us why this should happen even once...but twice is ridiculous. Finally, more housekeeping issues: throughout our stay, plates of half-eaten food sat outside rooms on our hallway, on the floor and on furniture, for more than a day at a time. It was, frankly, disgusting. Why wasn't this cleaned up? To see this at a hotel at the level of the Ritz is unbelievable. On the plus side, our suite was lovely, and the staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful.

Check-in was smooth and quick, even at 1 PM, 2 hours before normal check-in. A small box of chocolates and card was in the room for a belated birthday. We had an almost 2-year old with us, which was noted at time of reservation (because we did not want a crib but rather a king bed since she sleeps with us). We did receive a king bed, which I thought was very nice, but no special amenities of any kind for the baby, which some properties provide. A bellman brought our luggage very quickly and offered at that time to have the windows baby-proofed by having the handles removed (we opted not to). The minibar is stocked full of your typical drinks, and a small drawer above it contains other items such as playing cards, panty-hose, spare undergarments, jelly beans, a nice pocket-size map of the area, all available for sale. If you would like a mini-fridge instead, it will cost you $25/day. A nice coffee/tea kit is provided complimentary and is (usually) restocked at turn-down service, which happened every evening. In-room Internet is available via Ethernet at the desk, or via Wi-Fi however Wi-Fi did not work for our room. Connectivity to the access point was easy, but not to the router beyond that so no IP was acquirable. Not a big deal for us since we used our notebook at the desk, and I suppose a call would have resolved the issue at some point. I enabled private/secure Internet-sharing via Wi-Fi on my laptop to provide my iPhone with faster connectivity than 3G (although 3G seemed to work very well all around the city). The Business Center is near some of the meeting rooms and is operated by the contracted audio-visual company. Available 24-hours by room-key and then payment by credit card, it was not staffed during the day when we entered, but rather a sign said to contact the operator for assistance, which I assume would then have the staff paged. Equipment included 3 PCs (MPC-brand, so not very new but OK), a mid-size color-capable copier, and a multifunction device as a fax machine. A laptop station is also available to get online via Ethernet and printing via USB or Parallel. Rates are comparable to other luxury hotels; workstation rental is 75\u00a2/minute with a 10-minute minimum, printing is $1/page b/w and $1.75 color, copies are 30\u00a2 or less depending on volume, and faxes are $5/page domestic. A separate PC with printer is available and provided complimentary by the hotel for airline boarding pass printing. We rented a car at the hotel via Concierge and it is quite convenient. Rather than pay the $70/night parking fee (we never saw a parking lot), we rented and returned the car the same day. Even with last minute notice, Concierge was able to obtain a car for us within about an hour. They use Hertz, and have you provide your cc and license, then they complete the paperwork and have you sign the contract when the car is delivered and waiting for you at the front entrance. You walk out, show your contract to the doorman, and the car is right there waiting for you. When you return, they make sure the car is not dinged, etc., take your contract, and you're done. I highly recommend renting a car for at least a day if you are flying in as you can drive to Golden Gate, drive down Lombard street, and even cruise up to wine country, all in an afternoon. Taxi is about $45 including tip from SFO, so better to do that R/T and rent the car from the hotel for a day. Our rental was about $85 for a Mustang convertible (we didn't specify car except to request a standard car). A very friendly and helpful doorman was the only one to repeatedly call us by our last name during our stay. No big deal, but I know that is important to Ritz. On the other hand, almost everyone here said hello as we passed by and made us feel welcome. We mostly ate out, but had drinks at the Lobby Lounge once, and it was \"raw night\" where they offered a variety of oysters, shrimp, and crab (not everything was raw). We left our camera by accident, and our nice server had it held for us by security which is a standard procedure. Concierge left a message in our room and one call had it delivered to our room by a hotel manager. Good and honest staff and appreciated of course. We enjoyed the heated pool one day, as well as the much more heated jacuzzi. There was only one other family of 3 using it at the time we went, around 4 PM. We had full access to the locker rooms which have private lockers, nice showers, etc. The adjacent fitness center shares the locker rooms. The bathroom was nice, but not spectacular. No separate shower stall in our room as is required by AAA 5-Diamond standards. Nice shower, none-the-less, and nice Bvlgari amenities. Slippers and robes are in the room. A bathroom scale is also in the room, and an important convenience if you want to weigh your luggage to be within airline weight restrictions. Large enough lighted closet had a good supply of hangers and included an iron and ironing board and built-in free safe. TV was modern and a DVD player is in the below cabinet as well as a game controller for paid games. We did not find a channel that described the hotels outlets or services, nor did we find a written sample menu and description and hours of the restaurants, etc. Maybe we missed them?

He would help everyone else who had a few dollar bills in their hand; I tip if I receive good service, and don't believe that it should be something to expect. The valet was rude and never once greeted me. Housekeeping was spotty as well - bottled water and Kleenex were not replenished until I left a note for them. Bathroom sink area was not cleaned daily as I could still see the water stains. Even turndown service was off each night as items were placed differently and music was played on some nights but not others. The gym was in the basement. It's small and stuffy.

This is my additional 2\u00a2-worth. Stayed for one week in a 1-bed suite in the R-C SF in September 2009. Located at the top of one of SF's more challenging hills, the RC SF is away from much of the city centre's noise. If, like me, middle age is taking its toll, you can maintain your dignity by ascending the hill by cable car: there is stop right by the hotel. Good points: The hotel is immaculate: spotlessly clean, everything well-maintained, and largely tastefully decorated (though with perhaps too much yellow used in the guest rooms.) The welcome was friendly in an over-rehearsed way usual to top-class US hotels. Assistance with bags was offered, and names used throughout. The room was of a good size, well laid out and, apart from a couple of criticisms outlined below, perfect for our stay. The club lounge is an excellent idea, offering 4 food \"presentations\" (their buzzword, not mine) throughout the day, including an excellent breakfast offering and concierge service. Less good: The room had a slight foody odour. I never did work out the cause. On one morning, a workman was clambering about on the roof at 07:20! As we were on the top floor, the noise was highly intrusive. A complaint to the management led to their immediate offer of reducing the bill by one night's room charge and tax. Impressive. Other negatives are minor: Wifi was free but poor reception; the colour yellow was over-used in the room; the Bose iPod dock in the living room should have been matched in the bedroom - does anyone still carry CDs with them?

Our stay actually began before we got there, since I had several communications wth Alex M. about my wife's likes and dislikes, so that when we arrived in our room, flower petals were everywhere, fresh flowers were on the desk, they had prepared a special gourmet chocolates display, a cd of San Francisco music had been burned and was playing when we came in, and a bag of their wonderful Bulgari toiletries was waiting with a nice note telling my wife they had heard she liked them. Even our kids got some puzzles, stuffed animals, and a special cookie plate just for them with their names written in chocolate. They even left birthday cards for my wife. We were blown away. Everyone there had a smile on their face and were genuinely nice people who clearly went out of their way to help us out, with anything we needed. The doormen and concierge were particularly helpful for touristy questions and suggestions. We loved the location, right next to Chinatown, and right next to the cable car lines. The Ferry Building is a mile away and Fisherman's wharf is a mile and a half away, both downhill, which were both interesting walks/cable car rides. If a cable car is too full, spend a few bucks on a taxi, or ask for the hotel's courtesy car. Everything was easily accessible. We found no snobbery here, our kids were welcomed by everyone, they joyfully used the pool, and we would absolutely go back, in a heartbeat. The Ritz Carlton SF was classy and elegant, and very friendly at the same time. Finally, you can rent a car from Hertz directly at the hotel, which we did twice, for a two day trip to Napa in the middle of our week there, and a day trip to Monterey towards the end of our stay. It was very convenient to drive up to the front door of our hotel and to be able to leave the car right there. I would strongly recommend this, once again to anybody, and yes, young kids can have fun in wine country. The Ritz Carlton SF is a great hotel - with great people. I recommend this to anyone, and I will certainly come back in the future. Great job!!! p.s. Two additional things: Bay City Quackers, located next to the cannery building on Fisherman's Wharf, was amazing. It initially sounds hokey, but it was a highlight of our trip.

Granted that it is a hotel in a city, not a resort, it may not be a fair comparison. But while the amenities were good and staff was friendly, a certain element was missing. It's hard to put a finger on it, but I think it'd be best to summarize it as attention to little details. Here, we felt the staff was courteous (probably because they were trained to do so) but they didn't really go out of their way to help us. For example, there is a greeter at the front door who stands there and say \"have a nice day\". One morning, while waiting for our car outside, I realized I wanted to ask a question to Concierge. When I ran back into the hotel, the same gentleman who had just greeted me less than 2 minutes ago didn't recognize me and said the same perfunctory \"have a nice day\". One more example, the suite had a nice coffeemaker right at the door. So, one evening, I decided to brew a cup, only to realize that the water reservoir in the coffeemaker was not clean at all (it was actually filthy!). Ritz Carlton SF was a great hotel for our trip.

It lacked the \"wow\" factor that I've become accustomed to at many high end hotels.

Staying at other Ritz Carlton properties, I often found it impossible to avoid staff member greetings, but this was not the case. It may appear a minor quibble, but that's what give high end properties a certain panache - the high \"touch\" level.

However, checked out on the third day morning, no one standby to assist luggage, no one ask if I need a car or cab, the front fesk did not even ask how was my stay, just look too cold as Ritz Carlton staff. Also once again, no one open the door when I was leaving. And btw, during my entire stay, whenever I walked by the lobby, no one ever smile, or say hi or how are you even they adknowledge my presence. 5th down point. All in all, my stay was nice, nice room, nice toiletries, nice breakfest, but I expect the staff to be more warm, friendly and helpful.

We visited SFO in March during our daughters' spring break. We booked a club level room and was so glad that we did. What a wonderful group of people on the club level. The food presentations that they provide are wonderful for adults but kids probably won't want to eat that fancy stuff. Never fear, just ask for a kids club menu. They will make them a PB&J, mac & cheese, or a deli sandwich for the kids but you will have to ask for it. The club has something for everybody. They also provide late afternoon cocktails for the adults with a martini menu, wine, and all of the call brands of liquor. They also have a great pool and spa area on the 1st floor so bring your flip flops and suit. Our room was a junior suite on the 7th floor and was approx. 600 - 700 square ft. The hotel provided a roll away for our daughter. There was a love seat and chair in the room but they were not pull out beds. The only thing that I could have recommended to the hotel is that we would have preferred the room have a pull-out sofa as opposed to a roll away but it was really such a small detail and wasn't an issue at all. Our room was quiet too. We did hear the cable car going by and some limited traffic but it really was muffled. Besides, hearing those cable cars just adds to the charm of the city. The cable line runs just a block away from the hotel and is just on the edge of China Town. We tried one chinese restaurant called R & G that the concierge recommended to us. I had the salt & pepper lobstser and my husband had lemon chicken. My meal was tasty but they prepare it by frying the entire lobster and brought the head and all to the table. I don't know about you but I don't want to know what it looked like in it's natural state as it's sitting on my plate. Our waitress was nice enough to remove the lobster head for us. The lemon chicken was a little on the dry side but overall pretty good. Oriental Pearl was another restaurant that the hotel recommends. Union square is about 3 blocks away from the Ritz. Bring your walkin' shoes! When returning to the hotel you will climb straight up hill and gets your heart pumpin. The hotel was absolutely fabulous and all of the Ritz staff bent over backwards to anticipate our needs and requests. San Francisco is our new favorite city and I can't wait to come back.

Again everything you''d hope for in the changing rooms - even robes in the lockers and non-slip flip-flops to get you pool side.

Fine if you're on expenses and several people clearly were - popular place for business meetings. However, friendly concierge and reception staff happy to recommend nearby eateries, We tried Brandy Ho's in China Town - excellent food, cheap no MSG, a little basic re decor but watch them cook - real wok and woll!

The Ritz Carlton is a beautiful hotel! The lobby is gorgeous and the hallways are decorated with artwork from local artists that depict famous landmarks and scenes. After flying into San Fran from NYC it was late and all of the restaurants were closed luckily there is 24 hour room service! It is expensive. My husband and I ordered: (salty) chicken fingers and fries, cheeseburger/fries along with two sodas and it came to $60. I later read the fine print on the receipt and there is a $4 delivery charge so I think there is no need to tip? I did anyway. I also ordered room service the next day for breakfast which was a 3 egg omelet (cheese, spinach) along w/toast and a coffee that came to $40. After the first day no more room service, though I must say the breakfast was superb. The room was spacious and the sheets were phenomenal (400 thread count, make it hard to get out of bed). The Ritz also has different pillows to accommodate you (fluffy, soft, hard). The room had a 32' flat screen television with a wide selection of movies to order from. Wireless internet service is available. The room was also equipped with a Bose system that allowed you to plug in your ipod. Bulgari also provides all of your toiletries. I loved the turn down service! I would come back to my room exhausted and have chocolates on my bed, a copy of the latest headlines from the New York Times, and the local jazz station playing. It was so relaxing and thoughtful. The location is perfect and a 2 minute walking distance to Chinatown, Union Square (tons of shopping), bus stops, trolley stops,and Grace Cathedral. The entire staff was very knowledgeable. I needed walking directions to the murals on balmy avenue and there was a line at the concierge (also extremely helpful) so one of the bellhops just asked how can I help you? How awesome is that? He gave me directions and I was on my way. I wish I had gotten his name because he was very helpful. The cleaning staff was awesome, I think my cleaning ladies name was Yalitza? she was phenomenal. The only problem I had with my room (#360) was that it is what I would consider the bottom floor. In order to access the room you have to take the elevator one floor down to the 3rd floor (which I think is the conference room floor), then walk down some stairs to access my room. It was directly across from the kitchen? and above the beautiful courtyard. Besides the steps which is not recommended for disabled visitors, it was loud on the last 2 days of my stay. There might have been a wedding or some function that lasted what seemed like 3 in the morning. I also think hotel guests would go there to have a smoke or drink with friends which equals loud noise. To be honest I expect to have a great room at the Ritz especially for someone who pays $500 a night. I was a tad bit disappointed in the room. I am sure I could have switched rooms but it was late and I did not expect to hear noise two nights in a row. I have visited the Ritz Carlton in New Orleans and they are all beautiful hotels with attentive staff. All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Ritz Carlton and I would visit again.

I run 5 miles 3 times a week, and I still will not walk to Pier 39 in heels especially if we are on our way to dinner.

Especially good service from concierge (David). One of the notable down sides was that although they rate child-friendliness highly on their website - this did not actually happen in practice. Reception staff were unaware of their POLO scheme and I had to ask for the gadgets to make the room child-friendly, even though I had registered for the scheme online. No kids menu in the hotel room to make ordering room service for children easier. This was not rectified even after I highlighted it to them. Also huge mis-communication during reception staff hand-over led to our baby-sitter being left waiting at reception for 45 minutes and therefore making us late for our dinner reservation at 'Chez Panisse' (I don't even think the reception staff were aware of the inconvenience caused)! Although this may sound like the makings of a bad review, we were won over by the spa and pool, great breakfast and room service, spacious classically decorated one bedroom suite - ask for a high level courtyard view (we stayed non-club as the standard prices had been hiked up by $200 due to increased demand caused by the conference). If compared with the Omni which rates No. 1 on this site - I think that the Ritz Carlton was better value for money because a non-club one bed suite (2 rooms) at the Ritz costs the same as California suite (L-shaped room) at the Omni. The Omni has no spa/pool and location not that great. If you have the money to spend I would definitely recommend the hotel for location (close to cable cars, china town, shopping), good knowledgeable staff (with prompting), pool and spa, great playground a few blocks away reachable by cable car.

From the greeters at the entrance to the front desk staff who greet you by name, the service is unparalleled. In addition the interior and exterior of the property are extraordinarily elegant, and the recent room renovations only complement the hotel. Although the stay was nearly flawless, there are a couple of things I do want to point out. I have stayed at this hotel since it opened, and I recall the Business Center that used to exist next to the Lobby. Although small, this center offerend free access to computers, which was convenient during my stay. The Business Center has since been moved to the third floor where one must pay for internet access. With all of the amenities offered at this hotel, it seems like free internet access should be an expectation. I actually found a business center with free internet access similar to what used to be offered at the Ritz Carlton at the nearby Mandarian Oriental Hotel where I used their computers. The Ritz definitely beats this hotel in nearly all aspects, except the free access to the business center. Furthermore, I noticed some changes in the Lobby Lounge. I have noticed a trend in the Ritz Carlton chain that properties are undergoing major renovations as the classic is being removed and the modern is being introduced. Some hotels like the Ritz in Laguna Niguel look more like W Hotels now. Fortunately, in my opinion the San Francisco hotel has resisted such extreme changes. The guest rooms have been tastefully redone, while maintaing a classic theme, and the lobby continues to define elegance. I just noticed in the Lounge that there were empty walls where pictures used to hang and new lampshades, and I hope that they are not the start of a new identity for the space. Another difference I saw during my week at the hotel was that there was no longer any live piano entertainment at night replaced with a CD recoring of \"W Hotel-style\" music that was definitely not suitable for the Ritz Carlton. I don't want to sound negative at all. My stay was basically perfect.

It had been several years since my last stay, so I was curious to see how the hotel had aged. My review of the property follows. The RC SF is located on Stockton St. between California and Pine mid way up Nob Hill. It is an impressive looking structure with the entrance and handsome lobby area located on the fourth (street) level of the hotel. There is construction ongoing at the corner of California and Stockton, but it appeared to be unconnected to the hotel and was not (other than being an eyesore) a bother. We arrived around 1 p.m. and check in at the front desk was painless. We had 2 rooms reserved, a Club floor executive suite with a nearby club king room. The suite was ready for occupancy, but the king was not. Both rooms were located on the 8th floor which is the actual location of the club lounge, though I think the RC classifies the 7th and 9th as club floors as well. The elevator for the 8th floor is via keyed access and opens directly into the lounge area where we were greeted warmly by the club concierge. Those of you who have stayed on the club floor of an RC know the drill. There is a light breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and after dinner serving served at appropriate times with coffee, tea, soft drinks, beer, wine and cocktails available all day. The rate runs about $150 a night more than a standard room, but I generally find it worth the money. While there was always a good variety of sandwiches, crudit\u00e9s, cheeses and desserts at the RC SF, the menu selection never seemed to change much during our stay. Still, it is a pleasant space and a popular gathering spot. The lounge is \"child friendly\" which made it a bit active during parts of our stay. Not bothersome really, but active. Our suite was in the typical RC \u201cexecutive\u201d configuration. The door opened into a small foyer with a closet and half bath. The foyer opened up into a living room with a desk, a love seat and 2 arm chairs. The window provided a view of\u2026well, not much. (I have stayed at the RC SF several times on several different floors and have never had a view of much of anything except buildings.) No balcony, but the windows did open about 3 inches to allow a breeze. A glass paneled door with sheer curtains separated the living room from the bedroom, which was nice sized with what I found to be a very comfortable king bed. The dressing area and bath (with separate tub and shower) was behind the bed. The suite was clean and fairly well maintained. A few pulls in the carpet and a bit of torn fabric, but nothing too bad. Other than the bed, the furniture was not extremely comfortable and needed updating, I felt. New flat panel TV\u2019s were present in both the living area and bedroom. Wireless internet at $12.95 a day was available, but somewhat slow. The bathroom was a bit cramped and poorly laid out, I thought, but serviceable. Good water pressure during our stay. The RC SF has a nice spa with the usual services available. It also has a very good fine dining restaurant on par with other RC properties. There is a talented harpist in the lobby bar during the afternoon and an excellent sushi chef there during the evening. There is a house car available for trips within a mile or so of the hotel. The biggest substantive complaint I had during our stay was the noise level in the room. I know that others on this site have made the same remark. The windows appear to be orginal equipment (If I recall the property opened in 1996) and do not have a great deal of insulation. There was a great deal of bleed through street noise at all hours of the day and night, which was annoying. Now on to being picky. Service at the hotel started off great and then went downhill. I was quite impressed with Valentine, the club concierge, and the front desk and bell staff...Jason and Joel at the front door were especially nice and helpful. However, the staff members at the lobby lounge and outdoor patio off the terrace bar (on the second floor in the courtyard) were weak. Several servers at the lobby bar were standing around chatting with one another, but not doing a good job watching the floor. Still, the service at the lobby lounge was stellar compared to the patio outside the terrace bar. I attempted to enjoy a spectacular afternoon there with a cocktail but could not get anyone to wait on me. When I finally asked for a drink from a passing staff member (who apparently did not work the patio) I was told to \u201cgo upstairs to the lobby bar to get a drink\u201d and bring it back. Odd, I thought, as there were people eating (inside and out) at the terrace restaurant. Certainly not the level of service I expect from the RC. I was also disappointed in the servicing of the room. We left early one morning and did not return until 4 p.m. only to find that neither room had been cleaned. When I called the front desk to inquire when the rooms would be cleaned, I was told that I should have asked for an \u201cearly\u201d service. Huh? Again, these are picky comments. As I am sure Mr. Roa (whom I respect for responding to the posts on this site) will admit, however, it is the fine details that separate a 4 star from a 5 star property. In the interest of full disclosure, I admit to being a fan of the RC chain and have stayed at dozen or so of their properties around the country. (Pentagon City and Cancun being 2 of my favorites.) To be frank, though, I prefer the Huntington Hotel in San Francisco. It is up the street at the top of Nob Hill on California. Smaller, independently owned, with a wonderful view from the rooms that front California (Grace Cathedrial and the park, with the bay visible in the distance from rooms on the higher floors) and well kept (although, in fairness, somewhat dated) rooms. Impeccable service. While there is no club floor, the Big 4 bar and restaurant compensate by being clubby and wonderful. Plus, even though my favorite rooms there front busy California St., they are much quieter due to heavy, insulated windows. I would have stayed there this trip, but booked late and the property was full. So, how has the RC SF aged since it opened in the mid 90\u2019s? Fairly well, I think, with the exceptions noted above. I give it a solid 4 rating. If they take care of the noise problem and work a bit on service issues, it will be a 5. All in all it was a pleasant stay. I hope this has been helpful and informative.

For many years my profession was customer satisfaction research where I administered and reported feedback from thousands of customer satisfaction surveys, interviews, and focus groups. I lead many, many customer service improvement teams for various industries. I've never experienced such customer service perfection. Every employee over the five days I was at the hotel was exceptionally friendly, concerned, knowledgeable, poised, and extremely well-trained. I kept trying to find a flaw and presented the staff with a number of requests and challenges. They passed each test with flying colors. RATES AND PACKAGES: This hotel is very expensive. However, compared to its main rival, the Four Seasons, the Ritz is less expensive. I highly recommend checking the hotel's website for a package. Try to get as many services included in your room rate as possible because every extra service you use is very expensive. I booked the \"Bed and Breakfast\" package which included a $55.00 per day /per room credit for breakfast, valet parking (at least 50.00 per day), and free internet access - about 13.00 per day. My package rate was $429 which I felt was a very good deal for this hotel. TIP: If you get a package, you will most likely be provided with a letter at registration that explains / confirms what your package rate includes. I recommend you read this carefully. The website did not tell me that the internet was included in my package. This detail was in the letter handed to me when I registered. Also, check the hotel's website frequently as rates can change quickly. If the hotel is not getting enough bookings for a time period, the rates may fall and the packages offer more services for less money. I was not going to stay at this hotel because I couldn't get a guaranteed king bedded room on the Club Level. However, a few days before arriving, I checked the website again and the \"Bed and Breakfast\" package was offered at $429. I thought it was a great deal so I cancelled my reservations at a 4-Star hotel and stayed at the Ritz instead. PUBLIC AREAS: Gorgeous and luxurious - - that is if you like traditional furnishings. The Ritz does traditional better than anyone. It's beautiful and yet avoids being stuffy. I really enjoyed spending time in the public areas of the hotel. ROOMS: If there is one area that did not wow me, it was my room. It was luxurious, large, and every thoughtful ammenity was placed at your finger tips. The very traditional decor, however, is understated to the point of almost being bland. The color scheme is pale yellow, gold, and taupe with white trim and ceilings - - and pretty much everything is one of these colors -- VERY monochromatic. The furnishings are top notch, however, and my room definitely had a luxurious feel and was very, very comfortable, quiet and immaculate. The bed was wonderful and had a feather bed over the mattress. While very nice, other chains - 3 and 4-star chains, are providing similar bedding so this did not stand out as much as perhaps in the past. I want to be clear that I did not dislike anything about the room, but it lacked that \"wow\" factor for me. This is, however, a matter of taste and I had friends who saw the room while I was there and loved it. I liked that my room had a laptop safe, flat screen tv, and a DVD Player. The mini bar actually had items in it that I wanted. It was very well stocked and the products were of a very high quality - - albeit expensive. I didn't mind paying for the quality and convenience it afforded me. ROOM VIEWS: This hotel is situated such that very few rooms will provide panoramic views of S.F. There are also rooms that face into the hotel's courtyard. I was aware of this before I went to the hotel so it was not a problem for me. I would be happy with either since the street views are not that great. BATHROOMS: This hotel opened in 1991. By today's standards, its bathrooms (in most rooms) are not small but not as large as newer hotels. They are, however, luxurious. Apparently some of the larger suites have separate shower and bath tubs. The tubs are larger than usual although not the huge soaking tubs some hotels are providing. Right before my visit to the Ritz-Carlton, I stayed in a 4-Star hotel. The marble bath in this hotel had an enormous soaking tub and shower that were separate. It's not that there is anything wrong with the 5-Star Ritz, it's just that 4-Star competitors are quickly closing the gap in some areas and their rates are very competitive. The Bulgari bath ammenities are wonderful. I rarely notice these when I travel (about 100 nights a year in hotels) but I really liked these and even bought some in the gift shop to have shipped home. FITNESS CENTER: There is a well-equipped fitness center on floor one of the hotel. It has all the usual equipment and a small indoor pool. The treadmills and cross-trainers had individual TVs with headphones provided. The mens' locker room was great with marble everywhere and very nice wood lockers. The steam bath was great! Shower gel, shaving cream, conditioner, shampoo, huge towels, etc. were all provided. SPA: The hotel has a small spa. TIP: If you want to get a spa treatment, I would book as much in advance as possible as treatment rooms are limited. I overheard two telephone conversations where guests were unable to get a massage because everything was booked. VALET: I used the hotel's laurdry/dry cleaning service three times. I was very expensive, but the laundry is in-house and they did a great job and were quick! I turned in some laundry early one morning and it was back by 1:00 or 2:00pm. LOCATION: This hotel is in an excellent location on Nob Hill. You're just a few blocks from everything - - although as one reviewer said, you'll be walking up some steep hills to get back to the hotel. OVERALL, I give this hotel an excellent rating. I recommend it highly as it's one of the best in the luxury category - - especially if you can snag a great package like I did. The Four Seasons may have a few more whistles and bells - - as well as higher rates, but the Ritz is just as wonderful in its own way.", "Date": "September 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely first class\u201d", "Author": "saltyseadog6", "ReviewID": "UR8535296", "Content": "We stayed here for the last leg of our honeymoon.

From the moment you pull into the hotel to the time you're waving farewell, you are the king (or queen for that matter)! Not a single member of their staff was unfriendly, talk about great customer service training! Anyone that, like me, thought that customer service died in the 20th century hasn't stayed at the Ritz-Carlton yet. It is each of the staff member's personal goal to make sure you have everything you need and they try their hardest to satisfy you in every way possible! They really go above and beyond what you'd expect from any hotel or resort, regardless of what you are paying. We stayed on the Club level and I can tell you that it was money well spent. Traveling with a toddler and an 8-year old, it wasn't that easy to just get up and go out to eat three times a day, and the food in the Club Lounge was perfect for us. The five food presentations every day were indescribable! They have a great breakfast display and then lunch and then afternoon tea followed by a caviar and light dinner display and then all topped off by a decadent evening dessert presentation. And when they say presentation, they really do mean a beautiful arrangement of artistically crafted food creations that are as appealing to the eye as they are to the taste-buds. The pool/spa was a wonderful treat as we spent almost two hours everyday down there. The 1st level spa (which by the way is below the 4th level main floor) was like a peaceful retreat to the mostly noisy and bustling city around the hotel. Filled with scented candles and soft music, you really get the full relaxation you need while down there. The locker rooms were elegantly appointed and had all of the bath necessities you could ever need. The rooms were nicely decorated and the bed and bedding were so soft. The bathroom was spacious and the Bulgari products were definitely a nice treat. Luxurious bathrobes and slippers were ready for us each day and they even had small sizes for the kids! Even the roll-away bed we ordered was soft and comfortable. As for the location, it was close to just about everything. And any place that was further than walking distance we just hopped in one of the \"House Cars\" and got whisked away in luxury to any place we wanted around the city. This is a great complimentary alternative to taking taxi's everywhere and all you have to do is give them a tip, which you would have to do for a taxi as well. My wife and I really enjoyed being driven to dinner in a brand new Mercedes-Benz S550 and when we were done a quick call to the Hotel and we were being picked up right outside the restaurant. Talk about VIP service! If you do decide to walk to your destination (which we did quite often), be prepared to walk up and down some steep hills. This is to be expected almost anywhere in San Francisco so it's no big surprise. We actually found it a bit fun, while it was challenging at times, to run up the hills while pushing a stroller! Not really a big deal even if you're out of shape like we are.

The wireless connected quickly and was stable - though only one computer could be connected to the internet at once. As a more romantic getaway, the Ritz was nice.

Also, my son had a massage in the spa. When he signed the slip afterwards they had added on for \"therapist services\". Assuming this was a tax of sorts, he then also gave the therapist a tip. Afterwards we discovered that the \"therapist services\" was in fact another way of saying \"gratuity\" (20%). At no point did the staff mention to him that the service was already included and pocketed the extra tip! We had this deducted from the bill when we discovered it.

Many of the things I adore about this property have not changed but unfortunately some important things have slipped. For this visit, my reservation was made directly through the Hotel two months prior to my stay. I called direct in order to book a specific room --which I liked very much in the past-- or a room in the same approximate corridor offering a similar view. This was not a difficult request due to the size of this property and number of rooms that fit this description- if my first choice was not available, I was hoping for an exterior view and was not restricted by budget. I also requested two dinner reservations for this visit. When I arrived at the Hotel and checked in, I inquired about the location of the room and was told it was interior facing. This was not what I had requested or ideal. I asked the young woman at the front desk about my special request and she said it could not be accomodated as the Hotel was quite booked. I asked if they might have a higher category room or Suite available. Unfortunately, she told me there were no other options. Not happy about the sitaution, but still happy to be in one of my favorite places I succumbed and headed off to my room. Things went along as they usually do...lovely flowers, pleasant staff, well maintained facilities, nice displays of food and drink (on the Concierge Floor) and the expected top notch Ritz Carlton SF experience. Day two after hoofing it around the city all day we returned to the hotel to get ready for Dinner and had a message in regards to our Dinner plans-the RC had mistakenly made an 8:00 P.M. Dinner reservation for that evening. It was now 5:45 P.M. and the Concierge contacted the restaurant but unfortunately they were unable to accomodate us. The concierge suggested a few other options-we took her suggestion, and when she phoned us back she notified us that the only opening was at 6:45. Unfortunately since it was Saturday night our options were limited. We quickly showered and headed off to Dinner. After returning from dinner the Concierge greeted us and asked how everything was. We told her the restaurant was very pretty and had a nice atmosphere but the food was just okay. She inquired about what we ate and how the rest of our stay was and we told her how dissappointed we were with a few things and then breifly detailed the room situation, missed reservation, etc. She then stated \"not all experiences are perfect\" and to \"contact her in the future so she could assure we would be taken care of\". Hmmmm-can you say stunned? I thought I'm sorry or I hoped you would enjoy the food more might have covered it more tactfully. I enjoyed the remainder of the evening but thought Wow-did that just happen? It is true, \"not all experiences are perfect\" but as a frequent traveler I fully well know that. I don't think that line should be uttered by a staff member under any circumstances let alone this one especially since I was (and we were) just answering her question. People make mistakes, and that is why they call them mistakes. I was irked but willing to overlook a less than flawless stay. One mediocre visit would not prohibit a future one. I hoped it was just a hiccup. All I can figure is the place seemed understaffed (turn down service was occuring well after 10:00 P.M.), dirty plates and glasses were everywhere especially during the Morning and Cocktail Hours. And lastly we requested a late check out and that too was something that could not be accomodated.

This truly is a wonderfully run hotel with every amenity provided for. There was a misstep at the beginning which should have been addressed but wasn't. We arrived at 3PM for checkin only to be told our room was not quite ready and to check back in about 20 minutes. When we checked back we were told it would be another half hour at least. At that point we should have been offered a drink in the lounge or even a glass of water but they did not do so which surprised me. Upon arrival into our room at 4PM we were delighted to find a large comfortable room with a lovely view toward the front. From that point forward the service was truly the Ritz. We had a breakfast package so took advantage of that the next morning. 37.00 for the Buffet was way to steep for what was offered but that did not seem to affect anyone there except us. We were told we could go to the buffet as part of our package but later learned there is only a 55.00 credit allowed so had to pay the difference. Just another little misstep in an otherwise wonderful experience. The French toast on the regular menu was wonderful so I suggest you skip the buffet and go ala carte instead. The hotel has a Cable car stop right at the corner you can buy either an all day or three day pass to ride since it is 5.00 each way. Check with the Concierge on where to buy the three day pass as you cannot get it on the cable car. We used the system to go all around the city it worked perfectly for us. Parking is pricy at 59.00 a night (yes, 59.00) there is a garage down the street for 32.00 but you cannot go in an out during the day that is why we used the cable car.

What I liked is that they didn't automatically assume I wanted to pay $59/night for the hotel's parking service. But ultimately we decided to use the hotel's service because it's so convenient and given that in San Fran $59/night isn't too bad. We checked in at the front desk and everything went smoothly. Everyone greets you with a smile and a \"hello\". But what was interesting and a little bothersome is through my entire stay no one bothered to find out what my name was, only my friend that came with me that the room was booked under. Hmmm....

Not sure if this is due to the renovation. However, we could hear folks walking around the hallway if they were talking loudly, but it didn't happen often. Security seemed good. One time I left the door slightly open and security knocked and let me know the door was open. Not bad. All in all it was a pleasant stay. Was it worth the money?

The Club Level is the way to go - food is available all day long, from about 6:30 am until 9:30 pm, or thereabouts. I gained nearly four pounds while I was a guest there - the offerings are irresistible and delicious! While I had dinner reservations out each night, I could not pass up the great hors d'oeuvres and desserts. Believe it or not, I chose this hotel over the Four Seasons, because the Ritz has an in-room coffee maker, which the Four Seasons does not. At this price level, this is what I expect.

Nothing was too much trouble for Tammy and Lisa, the concierges with the mostest on the Club Lounge level. Tammy regularly emailed before our visit, securing bookings at some fabulous restaurants and making excellent recommendations. Everything from tours of the Mission murals to the best Indian restaurants in town were all immaculately arranged. We even secured a 2 night upgrade to a suite over Valentine's Day. On admitting that we were unable to finish Chef's Ron Howard's gourmet Valentine's dinner due to 'tiredness' and a surfeit of cocktails, Lisa empathetic to the last, mixed us some stonking Bloody Marys to provide an uplifting 'morning after' breakfast cure. Lisa's Margaritas were also some of the best we have ever had. Ritz Carlton San Francisco is located on Nob Hill, around the corner from The Fairmont and Intercontinental. It is close to the centre of the city and transport is easy and safe. We bought a $49 tourist pass and visited 2 art museums, cruised round Alcatraz and had unlimited transport for the week. The only cabs we hired were to and from the airport. Everything else is eminently reachable. One of the great attractions of this beautiful city is its lack of American sprawl and containment. We checked out 4 Seasons (see separate review) and there is no doubt that in terms of style and ambience, Four Seasons easily leads the way. There is a certain, almost French, overkill to Ritz Carlton decor. It is a stylistic challenge for RC management when the hotel will inevitably seek to attract a younger clientele with greater vigour. The hotels will need to stylistically follow on from the redesigned website. However, this is not to imply that Ritz Carlton is a stuffy hotel. We stayed seven nights and the hotel was positively buzzing 24/7 with no shortage of aforementioned young people enjoying the unbridled service of Ritz Carlton. Whilst one may hesitate over the slightly gaudy ostentation, nothing can detract from the immaculate service. It was very friendly, not the robotic 'my pleasure' scenario and equally not so overbearing that you had to escape to secure private space. Club Lounge breakfasts were not to my taste, despite the availability of rather tasty warm flans. However my wife feasted on the mountains of fresh fruit and smoked salmon. One minor gripe was that the showers were a little tame for a Ritz Carlton. We obtained an excellent flight and hotel deal through Expedia and the current exchange rate makes a USA holiday very alluring. Best restaurants: Ruth's Chris for steaks, Mama's for omelette breakfasts, Sears for coffee, Big 4 @ The Huntington Hotel for succulent crab cakes and wild boar. If you want as much as you can eat Indian food for less than $20, then the wonderful Shalimar is recommended. Avoid 'Top of the Mark' at the Intercontinental. Despite Tammy securing us the best table with magnificent views of San Francisco, my wife and I walked out. Appalling and brusque service, long waiting times in the lobby and menu restricted to two main unappetising dishes.Packed to the rafters with too many punters crammed into too small a space. Art Galleries: Make the trek to the de Young museum. It's worth it. Stunning collection, wonderful building, a work of art in its own right and fabulous views from the top of the Haman Education Tower. You can take flash free pictures too, which is a real bonus for the usually precious art fraternity. The Museum of Modern Art is another iconic building. We took an excellent tour that gave detailed insights into Pollock, Manet and home grown Arneson. Pop across the road to the Buena Yerba Park and enjoy the fountains and Martin Luther King fountain memorial. Wear some Flowers in your Hair: Well no, but a visit to the City Lights bookshop still resonates with a radical flavour that harks back to a bygone era with large volumes of Kerouac and Ginsberg on display. Buy your 'Howl' T shirts here! If you want a really strange piece of local flavour, then visit Cafe Prague on Sunday afternoon at 4.00pm, where Mark Schwarz conducts a poetry reading workshop. Like a sequel to 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' a small group of aspiring poets perform their works in a muted, entirely bohemian cafe where the service is as poor as most of the poems. Try to contain your disbelief. You could not script this bizarre collection of poetically touched individuals. Art House Cinema: The Lumiere is well worth a visit if you are an outside the mainstream movie afficianado. We saw the most amazing Thai melodrama 'Tears of the Black Tiger' here. Shopping: Show your room key to the 'Pack and Wrap' sections at Macy's and secure an 11% discount on all your purchases. Finally stay at the Ritz Carlton if you can.

We had booked two interconnecting deluxe rooms through the American Express Platinum Fine Resorts and Hotels program (which I highly recommend using \u2013 more on that later). We enjoyed our stay enormously and have only good things to say about this hotel. I researched hotels extensively when I planned this trip. I read all of the reviews of the Ritz Carlton on this website, as well as in the standard guidebooks and Zagat. I debated between this hotel and the Four Seasons for quite some time. Weighing in favor of Four Seasons was the fact that it usually receives the highest ratings in all of the sources I checked and that I tend to like the sleek contemporary d\u00e9cor of the Four Seasons rather than the formal, faux elegance type of d\u00e9cor of a Ritz Carlton. Weighing in favor of the Ritz Carlton was that I thought it had a better location for San Francisco tourism and less of a business atmosphere (i.e., better for a family) than Four Seasons, friends of ours who had traveled to San Francisco with their children had highly recommended it, and it was less expensive than the Four Seasons for the same type of room and the same standard of luxury. I felt that I could not go wrong with the Ritz Carlton, and I was right. It was the perfect choice. The location was ideal for sightseeing. It is about two blocks from Chinatown, and a five to ten minute walk from the North Beach area (where we usually walked to a restaurant at night), Union Square, and the SOMA museums. Also, there is a stop down the block for the major cable car lines, and it just takes a few minutes to get to Fisherman\u2019s Wharf with the line we took. (A taxi to this area or to Telegraph Hill would not be more than five minutes). I never saw homeless people on the block of the hotel, and I felt safe walking around the immediate area at night. The hotel iself is in an elegant old building, and has a luxurious d\u00e9cor. As mentioned, although this \u201cold world\u201d elegance is not really my style (and I felt in particular that the breakfast restaurant could use a lot more light and a more casual and contemporary style), the hotel is definitely luxurious, without being stuffy or uncomfortable to be in with children. On the contrary, we saw tons of families with kids in the hotel while we were there (I totally disagree with a previous reviewer on this site that found the clientele of this hotel to be all old people. I did not see any old people at all, nor would I particularly care if I did). Our two rooms were quite spacious (especially for a city hotel), and I greatly appreciate the fact that we were able to get them interconnecting in a lower price category. Also, the rollaway bed in the second bedroom was free, and it is the only hotel I was able to find in downtown San Francisco that had this policy (although the Ritz Carlton makes up for it by charging slightly more than the others for parking). Our rooms had been recently renovated and were luxurious, comfortable and well appointed. The bedding and linens were exquisite. We always had delicious chocolate treats waiting for us in our rooms, and on our last night, received a special boxed set of treats with \u201cFond Farewell\u201d written on it in chocolate. The hotel has a lot of nice touches like that and wonderful attention to detail. Also, our bathroom amenities were always restocked \u2013 something that doesn\u2019t always happen even in other luxury hotels. There is a large indoor pool in this hotel. Although we did not have time to use it, I did check it out, and it looked pretty nice. I mentioned that we had booked this hotel through the Amex Platinum desk. If you happen to have a platinum card, this is definitely the way to go. Although we could not take advantage of several of the available benefits on this trip (upgrades were not available at the time we checked in, we did not need early check in or late check out, and we did not have an opportunity to have our free lunch in the hotel), we had a huge savings by getting a daily $80 credit towards the price of breakfast. We travel a great deal as a family and we usually stay in luxury hotels. Typically, breakfast for a family of five runs about $150 in these places. Likewise, at the Ritz Carlton. The credit took the pain out of the breakfast tab. Another hint for savings on breakfast when you have kids \u2013 ask for the kids\u2019 menu. On our first two mornings, it had not been offered to us and we did not know there was a kids menu (simply a discount on the price of the hot and cold buffet). On our third day, suddenly we were offered the kids\u2019 menus. Even my 16-year old ordered the Mickey Mouse Pancake off of it for $5. The portions on the kids menu are absolutely huge and they are all $5. The Mickey Mouse pancake and the waffles on the kids menu would be enough to satisfy any ravenously hungry normal sized adult. Honestly, I would have ordered from it myself had I not been completely embarrassed to do so. As it was, I ordered the continental breakfast for four times the price. The staff of the hotel is as friendly, courteous and helpful as they can possibly be. The service is top notch across the board from the chamber maids, porters, and doormen to the front desk. In fact, there was a glitch on one night during our stay, and it was handled in the best possible way. The hotel is undergoing renovation floor by floor. In the middle of one night, the alarm sounded several times within each of our rooms (and I believe throughout the hotel). I phoned the front desk who told me that everything was okay, but that the fire department was on its way. Apparently, as we learned subsequent to the incident, some construction dust on one of the floors being renovated got onto the smoke detector causing the alarm to go off throughout the hotel. Needless to say, we did not get a good night\u2019s sleep that night. Nevertheless, the hotel could not have handled this situation better than it did. When I went to check out, I spoke to a manager about it and he was as gracious and accommodating as he could possibly be. Before I could even finish my sentence, he refunded the full amount for the two rooms for that night. No questions asked. I left having a very positive feeling about this place \u2013 I will definitely stay here on my next trip to San Francisco.

When we arrived at the club level we were met by \"Brandi\" who showed us to our room, and gave us the run down on the Club lounge serving schedule. Very nice and friendly!! When we entered our room our song was playing on the CD player! They had burned a CD for us. They also had a small tray of chocolates for us with a Happy Anniversary message written in chocolate on the tray. The room was very nice. Wonderfully comfortable bed. NIce flat screen tv. Pretty marble bathroom with double sinks. They sprinkled our bed with rose petals at turn down! Sunday morning we went to the champagne brunch at the Ritz. Very expensive ($70 each), but wonderful food!! When we retrieved our car from the valet to go home they had a little note in the car thanking us for staying, another card listing the local radio stations and directions to the freeway, plus two bottles of water for us.

Our standard king room was generous in size and the bed was quite comfortable. The hotel is undergoing a major renovation and our room was not one of the newly updated ones. They informed us at check-in that the renovation was taking place on a floor by floor basis. We were there for two nights (on a Thursday and Friday) and we neither saw nor heard any construction. It was not a problem. The Ritz has a nice pool and hot tub on the lower level. If you enjoy steam rooms you'll really like theirs - it was spacious and really got cooking! The Lobby Bar was a good place to relax. In the morning they had complimentary coffe and tea. In the evening it was a nice place to have a quiet cocktail and do some people watching. A couple nights a week they have a Sushi chef on hand to prepare appetizer plates to order. We've stayed in several Ritz Carltons around the country and feel that this may be our best experience yet.

We also had breakfast in the hotel twice, and everything was fresh and cooked to perfection). Although the room itself isn't that big, it is large when compared to other San Francisco hotels. The bathroom was large, complete with his and her sinks, and a phone next to the toilet. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The hotel even has an indoor pool, which is rare in the city.

Lots of them, but dysfunctional. Pleasant check-in lady at the reception desk, but no-one to show us to our room. Room was good, with all the usual facilities of a $800+ suite, but nothing sensational. No large flat screen TVs, furnishings not opulent but ok. Club concierge was useless throughout our stay. When asked for tickets for either a ballet, opera or classical performance, simply turned to the internet. as you or I could have done. Failed to find any tickets, but their ticket agent had more joy, but by the time they got back to them to confirm, they had gone. (There was no need to check back with me, I had left clear instructions to buy tickets). Calling the concierge was impossible, voicemail.. ringing out.. answered and cut off.. answered and put on hold.. Trying to organise a car to take me back to the airport was challenging enough for them - had to repeat my instructions 3 times before they understoon - then they still got it wrong... see later. Staff knocking on the hotel door despite the do not disturb sign - very irritating. No turndown service despite a specific call (at 8pm) requesting one. Called to ask for mineral water (as is normally left on a turndown) - an hour later (midnight!) the housekeeper turned up to do the turndown! On check out, bell man tried to give me tags for my stored luggage. I explained that the car organised by the hotel would collect the bags ahead of collecting me from a restaurant for the onward journey to the hotel. He said I'd have to give the tags to the concierge and tutted and sighed when I asked him to pass them to the concierge for me. When the car came to pick me up, it only had 4 bags on board not the 5 they had collected from my room. Had to go back to the hotel, where the staff were very apologetic and accepted responsibility for the mistake.. but nevertheless, I was now running late. So, maybe I sound picky.. but in my books its the service and the attention to detail that distinguish an expensive hotel from a great hotel. The Ritz-Carlton is expensive, but the service is a big let down. Again, lots of staff around the place, but all seem disorganised and many unwilling.

Traveling with 2 small children under the age of 3 can be a challenge, and we had never stayed at a Ritz Carlton with our kids (we usually opt for the Four Seasons). But using the American Express Platinum program we got a reasonable rate for a suite and the upgrades through the program (early check in, late check out, room upgrade if available, breakfast credit, resort amenity) were really nice. The suite was fantastic. It was 1100 square feet with a very large living room with a 1/2 bathroom. There were french doors that separated the living area from the bedroom area. The bedroom area was a good size and also had a full bathroom. The only strange thing about the bathroom for me was that the shower and toliet were separated from the rest of the bathroom. I thought that was a bit odd (I'm used the the toliet being separate from the bathroom, but not used to having the shower and toliet together). In addition, between the bathroom and bedroom there was a sizeable dressing area... with a vanity, dresser drawers and closets. The dressing area was so large that we were able to put a rollaway bed in it with plenty of room to spare (the baby and toddler had to be separated one night ... they were waking each other up). Note: the living room was plenty large enough to accomodate a rollaway bed and a full size crib. The service was impeccable, very attentive. We ate at the Terrace restaurant for breakfast and I was impressed with the food, but most impressed with the kids menu. It had more than the usual chicken fingers/pizza offerings. And for breakfast, my daughter order the scrambled eggs with sausage off the kids menu and I ordered the same off the regular menu. When they brought the food to our table, her plate was identical to mine... just $9 cheaper! All facilities were top notch and my daugther was most impressed with the indoor pool. She couldn't stop talking about it. My only gripe about the place, they have a $55 (+ $7 tax) a day parking charge. That seemed ridiculous, even for a city like San Francisco.

Most hotels would call this breakfast layout a buffet as so many items were offered. The lunches, teas, cocktail hours were all delightful.
