It has a great location, less than 4 minutes to the Trevi Fountain, and lest than 10 to the Spanish Steps. The hotel has no elevator. Front Desk personnel are available, at most, 7 hrs a day. Breakfast is typical Italian but the Breakfast lady is kind and helpful. The 2 rooms we had were rather small but clean. However the shower stall, no tub, had mold in many places. You obviously pay for the location as the room is not worth the price. Most of the furnishings in the room are so old, they should be tossed. At Best this is a 2 star hotel. Those on trip advisor who rated it as a 4-5 star hotel are delusional. this place needs a bulldozer but the location is prime. We would never stay there again..At check in they give you 3 keys. One for the door on the street, one for the door to your hall and one to your room. This certainly suggests that front test personnel are not available some of the day and all of the night. If you need a cab on the day you check out, you better have them call it in the day before because if you leave early, they wont be there to call the morning you leave. If you leave your screen less window open at night, you can hear the cars swish by in the adjacent tunnel... and bugs fly in", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heviz, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cWarmly recommended!\u201d", "Author": "Hegedus_Zs", "ReviewID": "UR127404614", "Content": "We stayed one week at the hotel and we were fully satisfied with everything.

I chose this hotel for location, cost and based on the very good reviews on tripadvisor. We caught the bus from FCO airport, cost 6 Euros each (usually 4 but the bus was just leaving so we paid the extra). From Termini station it was about a 20 minute walk to the hotel. Ok if you have light luggage or a bag with sturdy wheels! On arrival we were offered the sister hotel for one night as they had oversold. We declined as we were only staying 3 nights and didn't want to swap hotel mid-stay. I'm guessing a later arriving guest didn't get a choice. We were then given room 204. It was tiny! The window only opened onto the stairwell so the room was dark. Bed okay but with the flattest pillows I've ever seen. Unfortunately we also had a very noisy family staying next door and the walls were thin enough to hear every loudly spoken word. Bathroom also tiny but adequate. Room overall okay as we didn't spend much time in it anyway. Breakfast was simple but good - croissants, rolls, ham and coffee. Not enough tables if everyone comes down for breakfast at the same time so there was some hanging around one morning. The hotel is in a great location - 5 minutes to the Trevi Fountain and about 20mins to the Pantheon. There's a stop for the sightseeing buses about 5 minutes away which we used to get to the Vatican and back to Termini at the end of our stay. Loads of restaurants closeby so the hotel has a good location for resting feet and changing before embarking out for the evening. The Despar (Spar) is across the street - very handy for a pre-dinner beer as the cost of beer in the Rome bars and restaurants is prohibitive (6 Euros, compared to 1.59 in the Spar!) Overall maybe we were given the smallest, darkest room in the hotel. For location it was great, cost was competitive but on the basis of our experience I wouldn't stay here again.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cReasonably priced gem with a fabulous location & Staff.\u201d", "Author": "mikhel", "ReviewID": "UR125610934", "Content": "We have just returned from a five night stay at Residenza Ki and can't recommend it warmly enough.

Rooms are of a good size, extremely clean (cleaned every day) and very comfortable. Breakfast featured pastries and the usual continental fare accompanied by juice and a good selection of hot drinks. Rooms feature flat screen TV's (some with English satellite channels) and the complimentary wi-fi has a strong signal. There are also a couple of free internet access points available for those without netbooks. What impressed us most about the Ki was the friendliness and enthusiasm of the staff. Diogo, the manager, provided friendly advice, useful information and was happy to arrange museum tickets and restaurant reservations. When we experienced a problem with our bathroom he sorted things out quickly and with the least possible fuss. Other members of staff were similarly friendly and happy to help. The only problem that we could see with the hotel was that its lack of a lift and multiple flights of stairs probably make it unsuitable for those with mobility problems.

We arrived on the road, and the taxi driver dropped us off on the road and we couldn't find our hotel anywhere. We wandered down the road with our bags before figuring out that it was not labeled at all. There is no sign. 2. On the hotel's website, it says that reception is open until 10pm. We arrived at 8:30, and found a note taped to the unlabeled door that is outside that hotel that said \"As you can tell from our website, reception closes at 8:00pm every night\". They told us to follow the attached map to a sister hotel that was a 10 minute walk a way. They did not attach a map, so we were left in Rome, with our bags, at 8:30pm with no map. Also, when we figured out where it was, it was more like a 25 minute walk away, not 10 minutes. This was completely unacceptable. ***On a side note, the next night we came back to the hotel at 6:15 at night and saw a note taped to the door for another person that said \"As you can tell from our website, reception closes at 6:00pm every night\". However, whoever this was intended for did have a map attached. 3. I've stayed in a lot of budget accommodations. This hotel, while clean, had the worst bed I have ever slept on. It was similar to sleeping on a rough futon and I actually hurt all night while sleeping on it. It was awful. 4. The air conditioner worked, and was lovely. 5. For the 4 days we were there, we only had hot water 1 time. It was terrible, and nothing was done to fix it. It seems to be a problem over the past few months. 6. Our room, and another room, was actually IN the breakfast room. Our door was literally 6 inches away from the loud juice machine. This means that we were woken up every morning by lots of noise when breakfast was being set up (at about 6:30 am). Overall, this was an awful place to stay. It is in a good location, it is clean, but other than that I would not recommend staying there.

(And we loved all of our hotels during our Italy trip, and we stayed at mainly 1 and 2 star hotels.) Other than nuisances you can expect from most Italian hotels (no elevator and hotel not on first floor, queen bed is just two cots pushed together, TV has no English channels, strange location up a very steep street), there were two minor problems and two major problems that made this hotel a uniquely awful experience. Minor problems (frustrating but you can deal with them): *Air conditioning didn't work *Arrive past 4pm (when their concierge desk closes) and you'll need to walk 10 minutes with your luggage (mainly uphill) to their sister hotel, Saturnia. They'll give you your key, and then you're told to walk back another 10 minutes to Residenza Ki. (This happened to us, and, while apparently it's on their hotel's website, we were caught surprised because we booked through a third-party website as most international travelers do, and that website didn't mention this bit of information.) Major problems (main reasons not to stay here): *Building door lock jams randomly and can only be opened from inside *No 24 hour concierge desk (closes at 4pm) Because we dropped off our bags in our room and went out to dinner, it wasn't until around 9pm that we came back to the hotel and discovered the building's outside door was jammed. The Residenza Ki's concierge desk had closed at 4pm, but we were told (in perfect english) by their sister hotel Saturnia that we could call them at any time of night. So we called Saturnia about the door jam at the Residenza Ki, but no one there speaks english at night! Even better, when we got an Italian speaker from a local restaurant to translate for us, we were told by Saturnia they couldn't do anything right now!!! We had our bags locked upstairs in our hotel room, and we had to fly back home the next morning! While we waited over the next three hours, 8 other people staying at the Residenza Ki tried to get in with their keys and couldn't. We finally got inside around midnight only because one of the couples waiting with us had a sister in a hotel room taking a shower; we had to go down a dark alley behind the building, climb a grate, pound on her window, and finally she came downstairs and let us in. By the way, once we got inside, the front door lock didn't have any obvious problems with it, which suggests their building's front door lock is generally faulty and can jam on any hotel guest at any moment. Long story short, most Italian hotels (including the 1 star hotels) have 24 hour concierge, so why pick one of the few places without it? It was really the source of all our problems: we had to walk an extra 20 minutes with luggage to get our hotel key, we couldn't switch rooms when our AC wasn't working, we had no one to turn to when their buiding door lock jammed. It seems like a small insignificant thing if everything goes right, but a 24 hour concierge desk can be a lifesaver!", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA very pleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "Emma496", "ReviewID": "UR115262497", "Content": "We booked last minute and had little expectation of the room, but the location was perfect so booked any way.

Diego greeted us with such hospitality. He took his time in showing us where to go and what to do. Even was able to find us a tux rental place last minute for an event we were going to. Be advised, the style of the hotel can be best described as part of an apartment building, where they own several floors. Each floor has several rooms off of a main central room which has a computer for your disposal (very convenient!! a nice surprise!). The rooms are smaller, but as to be expected for any city hotel. It has recently been renovated which is great! The bathrooms are really nice. Only caveat, the water pressure in the shower is not so great. Otherwise, it's really really nice. Oh and the AC is really great! Perfect to save you from the summer heat! As it is an apartment style hotel, keep in mind that you will have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the reception, and an additonal flight to your room. But it's really not bad at all. The location is SUPERB! We came from FCO on the train to the Termini, then took the subway to Barberini. It's three blocks form the subway, which is great if you a traveling on a budget. Now as for location to sights, it's super close to the Fontana di Trevi. Walking is great in Rome as you can get to so many places in 5, 10, 20 minute walks. It's certainly safe and clean for a big city, plus you get to take in so much! It's also close to the Spanish Steps and the shopping on Via Del Corso. We even checked out the Villa Borghese, which is also a close walk. For the price, it is totally worth it! We loved, loved, loved our stay there! Just keep in mind that it's not the type of place with a grand foyer, but it's such a personalized experience. You feel like you've got your own awesome apartment in ROME! I highly recommend it! ***Side note: Be sure to buy a Roma Pass. It's 25 euro and admission is included to TWO sites, then discounted admission to places you visit after.

The rooms were basic, just a bed and a tiny bathroom. One of our showers was a bit dodgey, the shower head kept falling off, but to be honest I could live with that for a few nights. The water pressure was also rubbish :S The man at reception was nice and friendly and very helpful, and the breakfast was good - croissants and fruit and eggs, nice orange juice, excellent coffee.

If you sleep with the windows open there is quite a noisy road/underpass nearby, but if you've spent all day walking around Rome that's not going to be enough to keep you up! 2. As I said, rubbish water pressure from the showers. 3. Don't turn up late and don't tell them because you'll be locked out and confused and have to go to the sister hotel.

We've since seen a review on TripAdvisor that suggests that they may simply have overbooked... your guess is as good as mine. He put us in a taxi (which he paid for) back in the direction we'd just walked from to the 'sister' hotel - Hotel Saturna - which we were told was compariable. I have no idea if it the Saturna really is a compariable hotel because I didn't get to see what the inside of a room at Residenza Ki was really like. However, the Saturna was horrible. The room was small, it smelt of cheap air freshener, the bed was at an angle so your head was below your feet, the lights didn't all work so the room was dingy, the sheets has suspicious stains on them; the bathroom was tiny, mouldy and claustrophobic. There was also a pointless LCD tv that you couldn't actually see unless you would stood in the opposite corner of the room because of the angle it was sellotaped on to its stand at. Breakfast was adequate, but some of the offerings were stale. The staff, though pleasant, were a bit disorganised and sent us off in the wrong direction to buy opera tickets. Ultimately though, all of this would have been water off a ducks back as we've stayed in worse places as backpackers.

I checked another room in this place and it was nicer than the one we were given and since people were moving furniture into the hotel, it leads me to believe it was being renovated. The double room, which we were given, is not for families unless you have teenagers or the room is for 4 grown adults. Everyone is nice, but if you need any assistance, it will be hard because they leave the desk at around 3:30 every day and then, it's like you are in an apartment building.

The window wouldn't close, which is, according to the manager, is \"illegal in rome\". After our complaint, we got a promise that it would be fixed so we could get a good night sleep, and still no repair. The street that this hotel is on is busy so it's noisy at night. We also had an issue with our shower. It wouldn't drain and when we complained about it, it, too, never got fixed.

The room we got was cosy and the washroom was decently clean. We will likely visit Rome again, since this trip was too short, and we would very likely return to Residenza Ki..

After the 1st day, we were asked to move onto the second floor because the A/C was going to be checked to make sure it didn't break, which was a little annoying. Warning: There is no elevator, which is common in a lot of European hotels, be prepared to walk up/down a couple of flights with your luggage. In both rooms, the room and the beds were seemed clean, but the bathrooms were not. Besides being the smallest bathrooms in our 4 hotels in Europe, the showers had mold and rust stains on the walls, which made me feel worse after coming out of the shower. Also, the walls were thin. I usually don't let stuff like this bother me, but when you can hear people turning on and off a light switch from another room, that's bad. We were near the entrance from the stairway and could hear everyone coming in/out at night, which was very annoying. The hotel did have a free breakfast of very standard toast/pastries/coffee type stuff, and was probably around 15-20 min walking from a lot of the sites. And only around 10 min from the Trevi fountain, so there were plenty of shops/restaurants and the area seemed safe. Also, the stops for the hop-on/hop-off buses, as well as the Metro was only around 5 min away at Barberini. The hotel also arranged a taxi to the airport for our group of three at 50 euro, which seemed reasonable as the leonardo express train costs 45 euro for three people.

Its a plain green door right next to a little cafe. Look up a photo of it on trip advisor or search for it on street view of Google Maps before you leave so you know what you're looking for. The rooms were simple and clean. We stayed the first three nights on the second floor and came back a few days later to spend our last two nights in a room on the first floor. I think the room on the first floor was a bit larger, but just off the lobby, so not as quiet as the second floor room around afternoon siesta time.

Whilst we understand the need for such a rate and its application surely some compassion could be afforded. Then we were informed that perhaps we might be refunded 50%.

In a nutshell give them still more money.

Good Value!\u201d", "Author": "nyfep", "ReviewID": "UR61032731", "Content": "Residenza Ki is located right in the heart of Rome -- within walking distance of the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, the Spanish Steps. The Barberini metro stop is practically around the corner. This is a true Bed & Breakfast -- it is located in an apartment building. As others have said there is no elevator so you do have to carry your luggage up and down the stairs. However your hosts, Diogo and Francesco will surely help you. We arranged for a cab to pick us up at the airport so finding the hotel was not a problem for us, although I can see why people might have a problem locating it -- there is no sign so you need to look for the building number. The breakfast served every morning is very good, delicious pastries, bread, meats, cheeses, fruit. Our first morning there they also had yogurt, however for the rest of the week they seemed to have run out. The cappuccino and espresso is amazing, we always had to have two cups each morning. The women who run the breakfast room are very sweet. We stayed on the first floor, and given the fact that the hotel is in a very busy, touristy part of town, it was extremely quiet. Guests on the second floor literally wake up and walk directly into the breakfast room -- so be aware of that when booking a room. Our room was very clean, a nice size, the bed was very comfortable, but furnished very sparingly. We were lucky we were given a chair to keep in our room, so we had another surface to put things. However, the reason we were given the chair was due to the fact that the armoire to hang your clothes was made for someone playing for the New York Knicks. The bathroom was also very clean, nice shower, great water pressure, but again very few surfaces to keep toiletries. If you like to do any kind of stretching or morning exercise be aware that the floors are marble and extremely hard. Maybe bring your own yoga mat along. As another fellow traveler mentioned the wifi in the hotel was not working during our week-long stay, which was a bit of a pain since we lugged our computer with us and wasn't able to use it at all. Also during our stay our two hosts were dealing with some personal/health problems and were not around as much as we assume they normally are. We still have to say if you are a self-reliant traveler, don't need a lot of hand-holding, no 24-hour desk service or concierge - then we do highly recommend Residenza Ki -- you truly feel like you have your own apartment in Rome. But if you are expecting a true hotel -- this would not be the right place for you.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Uppsala", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good value\u201d", "Author": "teaterspoket", "ReviewID": "UR60808472", "Content": "Average hotel in a great location, clean, nice staff, simple breakfast, hard to find - no sign!

And most of them are local, if you really dont want to walk hop on the metro for 2 stops(which comes every 2mins) and your practically there. Ask about the ROMA PASS which makes everything a breeze. One thing to know as well to save yourself a tenner in a taxi-when you get to Termini train station from the airport the Metro station is directly underneath. Go 2 stops to Barberini and its just a couple of minutes walk from the Metro and mostly downhill!

But then we saw the doorbell corresponding to the Residenza, unfortunately we didnt get an immediate answer and we got a little nervous, but a charming gentleman who came out of the building was really nice and dialed the number that was indicated in the doorbell, but at the same time Diogo came in and took us inside. I emphasize: THERE'S NO ELEVATOR IN THE BUILDING, the reception is in the first floor and in our case the room was on the 2nd. So either workout before you go or pack lite ;-P ! The place was incredibly clean. Our bedroom was seriously large and comfy, the bathroom was regular sized and spotless (I really liked the mirror). The only downside was that they had a failure with the internet service and during our 3 day stay we couldn't go online wireless, but Diogo offered us to use his computer. One interesting detail is that you get SKY system in your tv, not that you want to watch much tv when in Rome but I've been to a couple european hotels and you only get a couple of channels when staying at budget friendly places The breakfast room was cozy and Andrea was always checking if she could get you anything. Breakfast itself is good: cold meats, buns, toast, fresh juice and fruit and delicious cappuccinos or lattes made at the moment. I really liked the fact that they give you your keys and it's like you have your own apartment in Rome! (that gets perfectly cleaned everyday :-) ) And the location is unbeatable: 20 min s max of a delicious walk get you everywhere, in fact, Trevi fountain is 2 blocks away!

The whole \"hotel\" is rotten, everywhere is black mould growing from the walls, they have a huge humidityproblem. And the solution is to paint the black mould spots with chaulkpaint! As a doctor I can tell you, it doesn't help anything! The mould is so deep in the walls that the whole building should get torn down so people wouldn't breathe the spores in their lungs and get a bronchitis, asthma etc. Everything in the hotel was broken; the beds were broken, the bedspreads had holes and all kinds of stains (disgusting white stains..) on them, as well as one of our matrasses had huge stains of urine or faeces on it! The only chair in the room had different kinds of stains on it. There hadn't been cleaned in ages, on the walls were stains and on the sideboards loads of dust. There was no hook for towels in the bathroom, it had fallen off and no one had bothered to fix it, in the wall were just the holes. The shampoostand in the shower was totally rusty. The dustbin was broken. The drain in the shower didn't work so as I showered the water flood on the floor of the bathroom and from under the door in the room. As I noticed it I had to soak it up with my towel fot the next 10 minutes. As I got new towels and explained the problem of the overflow to the cleaninglady she seemed to think it was perfectly normal. In the toaster from the breakfastroom only one side worked, the cleaninglady had to tell her guests every day the left side doesn't work. They serve some kind of croissants and danish pastry for breakfast. On 3 of our 4 breakfasts there was this same peace of pastry in the vitrine which contained quark and eggs, so it was definately not eatable after the first morning. But it was every mornig offered to the hotelguests. Probably someone ate it on our 4. morning, then it was gone. On our last mornig I must have gotten a foodpoisoning from the cold eggs, which had been cooked god knows when, and vomited and sat on the toilet for 24h. The personal was unfriendly and always tried to get up with excuses as I complained about for example the mould. As I told one of the staff I had been in better hostels than in this so-called hotel he even admitted he believed this. He tried to tell me something about italian standards, but I don't think this explanation is enough. We are in the EU and have standars that even Italy has to follow. I wouldn't recommend this shabby \"hotel\" to anyone!! The room I am talking about is by the way the room shown on their own internetpage, but the fotos must have been taken about 20 years ago. The adress Via Rasella 53 is by the way wrong, checking in is in number 56 and there is not \"Residenza Ki\" displayed there but something else about Bed and Breakfast. Didn't know that in the middle of the night. The telephone number on the doorbell of 53, that by the way doesn't work, is also wrong. As well as the number on their own internetpage is wrong. So I went to another hotel nearby and the nice portier made 5 phonecalls to reach our real \"hotel\". At 1.30 in the night.

The excellent service started from as soon as we made our booking. We received a confirmation from the hotel within an hour of making the booking (and considering we booked this accommodation after having major issues with the original hotel we had booked with this prompt confirmation was most welcome!) wanting to know the details of our flight or train and did they want us to organise a taxi to be waiting for us when we arrived in Rome. I can comment on two of the rooms, the family room 203 and the double room 205. When we arrived we were told that they had noticed a small problem with room 205 (not that this was something we noticed when we went to our intended room so it must have been fixed) and they upgraded us to a family room (room 203) so they could rectify the issue in our room. This forward thinking is not something that I have seen in budget chains and it was greatly appreciated by us. The family room was excellent, a queen and two single beds in the room so absolutely large enough for the family. It faces the street the hotel is on but is so quiet, very clean and modern room. The next day we were moved to the double room 205 (they moved everything for us, we did not have to do anything) and this room was also excellent. We had been travelling around Europe for about two weeks at this point and the previous double rooms we had stayed in were quite small and for the price we paid that is what we expected, but it wasn't that small at all. Might get a bit small if you want to spend all your time in your hotel room, but why would you want to do that, you are in Rome! Great room, again very clean (cleaned daily and linen changed daily)and quiet. And the rooms had air-conditioning which was most welcome due to how hot Rome can be (and was when we were there). The location of this hotel is fantastic, in a few minutes of walking you can be at the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza Navona, Spanish steps and other monuments. You would expect the hotel based on the location to be noisy, but it is so quiet. Close to heaps of restaurants and cafes and about five minutes walk to the closest metro station. The free WiFi also came in handy. The service that we experienced from all of the staff is on par with what you would expect from a five star hotel, they were the nicest, most knowledgeable people that I have encountered in any country while travelling at any time. The knowledge of their city is excellent, the pride in their hotel and work is evident at all times and they were such lovely people. They asked us regularly if we were comfortable with everything or if there was anything they could do for us, it was great. They also provided a great daily breakfast and the women working in the mornings make awesome coffee! Needed when hungover from too many red wines at the great restaurants! I would (and have) recommended this hotel to anyone who is looking for a fantastic hotel in Rome in a great location with excellent staff. Now if you are used to the Hilton and expect the rooms to be like the Hilton you will be disappointed, remember that this is a three star hotel. But the service is better than a five star hotel and you will not be treated like a number like you can be when in a five star hotel and the rooms are great. These people will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and at home and that is just what you want when travelling in another country.

The reality is that we only used the hotel for the basics, at no time did either of us want to stay in the room and relax, hello...it's Rome, get out and enjoy the city. The staff was very friendly and very accommodating, we went out every night so we never made it to breakfast but I am sure it was great.

Residenza Ki really has one of the best locations, with a very reasonable cost. The rooms are good, clean, and you feel like you're living there as it's not like a hotel. The rooms are all off a common breakfast room. They have a lovely lady who prepares breakfast for guests every morning. We found the breakfast adequate ( a typical Italian buffet, just don't expect a big American style breakfast - after all, you're in Rome ) and the staff just fantastic. Diogo at the front desk (a couple of doors down the street from the building that the Residenza is in) is particularly helpful. He is warm and generous with his advice about any questions you may have, gives GREAT suggestions for the best places to eat, and assisted us with a great many things (as did Francesco).

I had also read some very positive reviews on it. Overall, I found the hotel okay - no nightmares - but there are a few points that may be of help to others planning on staying there. Firstly, avoid room 205 - it is very small and looks nothing like their advertised picture. The bathroom left a bit to be desired (mouldy walls etc) and the air conditioning unit hadn't been plastered into the wall properly (bare wires and holes). On the plus side the room was clean and the breakfast good but three nights in this hotel was long enough. All rooms are advertised as having a safety deposit box but in reality at least two of the rooms safes wern't working. When we questioned this we were told at reception that a new safe would be brought in and that we were welcome to use the one behind the desk. We asked 3 times and nothing was done - in the end we just felt a nuisance, but we felt disinclined to leave large sums of cash in a shared safe as this would be a risk for the hotel (they're leaving themselves open to accusations, surely) as well as us. So we ended up carrying all our cash around with us - not a great idea in a city where the main crime is bag snatching. I even asked if they had another room with a working safe but they said the only rooms they had left were triples and, no, we couldn't exchange. Funny, at breakfast we saw the residence of each of the 6 or so rooms and none ever had more than two people staying in them.... When we arrived on the first day at 11 am we were told our room would not be ready until about 1pm. Official check in time is 2pm so we came back around 1.45pm. We then had to wait a further 45 mins until we could get into the room. Goodness knows what they were doing in such a small room - could have cleaned it myself in 20 mins. Official check out time in the hotel literature was 12 noon but on our last day we were told to vacate the room by 11am. We also took up the hotel's recommended airport collection taxi service . This cost Euro 45. If you get a regular taxi from Fiumicino they can only charge Euro 40 by law, so this was fair enough. However, on our last day we were told by other residents about a service called Roma Shuttle, which only charges Euro 30 for 2 people back to the airport. We tried to book this through the hotel but were told it was booked up. They seemed to know all about it but hadn't told us. Unfortunately there was a train strike on that day too so we had to get one of their taxis back as well. Some general info that may be of help in Rome: You can buy metro/train tickets in the stations - we were told metro tickets had to be bought from a newsagents shop. A single trip ticket valid for 75 mins costs only Euro 1 - bargain! I had read that if you have a small appetite and only want one or two courses eat in a trattoria or pizzeria instead of a formal restaurant (where they expect you to have the full four courses plus wine). Well even the most basic trattoria was not very amenable when we said we only wanted mains and soft drinks. They charged Euro 7 - 8 for two Cokes. And they expected a large tip (the norm in the UK is 10%) So either ignor the rudeness or be prepared to plough your way through four courses!! And don't fall for any 'cover charge' as this is now illegal in Rome. Overall we did have a great time - Rome is an amazing city, and coming from London we felt very safe - there's not much violent crime there.

When I asked for why this was, and what our next room would be he (Francesco) said that he didn\u2019t know, But for the inconvenience he promised us a much better and bigger room, so we shouldn\u2019t worry. So we packed our bags again and left them with the staff. When we came back to the hotel that evening we found that the room given us this time was a DUMP!!! The room was shabby, small and dirty. The bathroom was cramped and dirty with a shower that didnt have warm water half of the time. There was fungus on the shower walls (see pictures) and the shower was so dirty!! When we complained about this to the night courier he said that we had to wait to the morning as he couldn\u2019t do anything for us. So we had to sleep on dirty \"double bed\" which was 2 singles put together with a gap in between so sleep wasn\u2019t possible in anyways. In the morning we were told that all rooms where full and there was nothing they could do about this. When I questioned the fact that I had booked for 3 nights in a double bedroom and got 1 night and the rest been packing and unpacking and staying in a dump the guy from the staff said he apologizes about this and blamed it on Francesco. He admitted that it wasn\u2019t unusual that staff would \u201csell\u201d already booked rooms to tourists walking into the hotel, and that the situation with our room could have been such an event. That the room we got was the \"extra room\" in the hotel and not a normal room for customer already booking. What apparently had happened was that our room had been given to another quest because the hotel could get more money per night out of our room, and we who had booked in advance where given the worst and cheapest room because they already knew we had paid. As an evidence to this we have made sure to take photos of the room which was a dump, and also a letter from the staff in the Rezidenza KI where they apologize for the situation and admit to the fact that they changed our rooms in purpose to get more money. At end of the letter they ask us not to tell anyone about fraud as it would lead them to lose their jobs! I don\u2019t recommend this hotel to ANYONE!

We were greeted at the door and went up 3 floors... (there is no lift for those who would prefer it). We were told that we had to stay in a family room as they were over booked and then change the following night. This was fine with us.. until we went to sleep! Firstly the ceiling had a big hole in it which was covered by a blanket, and the bed was the most uncomfortable bed i think we've ever stayed in! It was creaky with every tiny move, the pillows were just rubbish. The bathroom was tiny and for a family room I was surprised at it's size. Anyway, we changed rooms the next day as we expected to, they told us in the morning that we could stay in our family room for the rest of our stay as they had a cancellation, but we decided to move anyway, we needed a good night sleep! Our second room was much better, even though it was off the reception/breakfast area. We did not find it very noisy but could quite possibly get noisy depending on how many people were staying. OUr bed was much better, but still a little hard, teh pillows flat and the room was freezing but once we worked out the aircon/heater it was fine.

The location and price were two of this \"hotel's\" strong selling points. The third selling point was that reviewers on this site rated it high for cleanliness, which it was. The first room we stayed in was small and the bathroom tiny. The second room we got, upon our return from Florence, was a triple and a nice size---a definite improvement on the first room. However, both rooms are somewhat austere. The breakfasts were fine. One night and for most of the next morning there was no hot water. When we arrived, Diego said that their computer system was down so that we would not have internet access. He said that he was hoping it would be fixed soon. My husband, an electronics and computer expert, checked around in the evening and easily hooked easily hooked us up to their system, which was not really broken. We were able to use our computer during our entire stay. Interestingly enough, the last morning of our stay, a Brit, who had recently arrived, asked about internet access. Again Diego said that the system was down, which was not true since we had just hooked up a few minutes earlier. Would I stay there again? Not sure. If I did, price would be the only lure. By American standards I would rate Residenza Ki as a two star.", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "dublin, ireland", "Title": "\u201cgreat!!\u201d", "Author": "shane-murray", "ReviewID": "UR7808108", "Content": "great stay, nice little quaint hotel at a reasonable price. we left a bad hotel and booked this with an hours notice. the receptionist couldnt do enough for us and he was helpful in any way possible. beds comfortable and spacious room. great overall!!", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farnham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and Central\u201d", "Author": "Lindy61", "ReviewID": "UR6789289", "Content": "Simple but very well done. Our room was spotlessly clean. We had a large room, 203 on the same floor as reception. It had a tiled area with a dressing table and 2 easy chairs then a step down to a double bed this area had a wooden floor. we had a small en suite bathroom with shower. We sometimes found it hard to regulate the water temperature, but there was always pleny of hot water. The temperature in the room was perfect. Breakfast was delicious, continental with pastries, rolls, meat, eggs and cheese. There was fresh fruit and cereal as well. The coffee was fresh and made just as we ordered. This hotel was in a really central location. We walked to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and the Pantheon. It is a five minute walk from Baberini Square with it's Metro Station and open top bus stop, these put you within easy reach of St Peter's and the Colloseum. However the hotel's situation on a small side street meant it was very quiet. We ate well but especially enjoyed Pepys Bar on Baberini Sq for lovely sandwiches, cakes and coffee to die for, and also Valentines Gelataria on the road to the Trevi Fountain from the Hotel. But I have left the best until last this hotel is 5 star because of it's excellent staff, from the minute we arrived early and dripping wet to the moment we left 4 days later after a late check out, we were treated like royalty. Nothing was too much trouble we were welcomed with coffee, talked through restaurants and given directions for sites. On our reservation I had put a request for foam pillows and this had been noted and was one of the first things Gigi spoke to me about, I always make this request and usually have to ask again once I've checked in, this level of service makes customers feel very special. Firstly Gigi and then when he went on leave Francesco looked after us very well. We would certainly recommend this hotel to our friends and would go back ourselves in a heartbeat. If you want a really Italian experience you can't go wrong. BTW our bed was also a little lumpy and a bit creaky but we slept soundly and woke without backpain on all 3 nights which is unusual for us!", "Date": "February 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "NOR_OZ", "ReviewID": "UR6752425", "Content": "My partner and I stayed three nights at the Residenza Ki at the beginning of February, and we were very pleased with the stay.

He provides a map upon arrival and circled all the main attractions. The room was nice, with a good and fully functioning bathroom (good shower). I would say that the bed could have been better as it was pretty uncomfortable and very squeeky. Other than that, no complaints.

The hotel promptly responded to our advance emails about a taxi transfer and we were duly picked up from the airport on arrival. However, when we reached the hotel we were told that we had to spend the night at the sister hotel, Hotel Saturnia (about a 10 minute walk away). This was extremely annoying since the reason we had chosen Residenza Ki was due to its central location. Residenza Ki arranged for the taxi to drop us at the sister hotel where we then spent one night. The next day Residenza Ki moved our bags over to the correct hotel and paid for our return taxi to the airport (45 euros) as compensation. I do not consider it is OK for a hotel to overbook you, particularly when you have paid in full in advance and the hotel knows for sure you are coming because it is sending a taxi to the airport to pick you up. On a better note, the staff at Residenza Ki were very nice, the accommodation basic but clean (unreliable showers) and the location great. Check out the history of Via Rasella if you stay there because it is interesting. We would stay there again if we could have the guarantee that we would be staying there !

I agree with the other reports say the room (we booked a triple) was very spacious, comfy beds, air con - mini-bar etc. tasty breakfast .. We found ourselves at breakfast wondering how it must have been when it was an apartment. A very homely place to stay in. The most fantastic thing was it's location! (5 mins from 2 famous landmarks and the Barberini metro station) We came out of the 'door' crossed the street walked down a bit, round the corner and there it was La Fontana di Trevi. Day or night it was beautiful as were the Spanish Steps.We mixed sight-seeing, shopping (bought a few handbags in the Carpisa shop), eating etcc. and didn't get lost once (our hubbies don't believe us) Went to a concert in a nearby church - mix of opera & classical which was nice. I love to see the t A small guide book and comfy shoes is all you need to see lots of famous landmarks. We took the metro to the Vatican - and went into the castell which was built for Hadrian (a bit of his wall is nearby our home - felt quite important!). Our weather for the 22nd of September was glorious. Even used a bit of sunscreen ?? We did find it a bit of a nuisance having to check in at the sister hotel (our flight came in at 9.30 pm) but we had prebooked a taxi with the hotel from the airport and I made sure it took us to both hotels. What was more of a nuisance was having to take our luggage back to the sister hotel to store it (our flight left at 10pm). However, it did let us see that we had chosen a much nicer, quainter part to have stayed at. Would recommend anyone to stay here.
