Walking distance from everywhere: tourist attractions, nightlife, metro, supermarket... Makes visiting the city a lot easier. 24-hour service provided by very nice staff and wi-fi access makes it even better. Check-in is at noon but if the room is ready, you can have an early check-in, free of further charge, like us. Gladly surprised that there where three bathrooms in a single aisle for people that chose to share a bathroom. We were expecting having to wake up early or waiting in line to take a bath, but not what happened at all. Never had to wait a minute :). Now, to be honest, rooms without a balcony are very, very small and there's no elevator, so you'll climb a few stairs carrying your bags. Showers are really really small as well, and it's hard to take a bath without splashing the whole bathroom.That's just advice for picky people. Whatever somebody may dislike about this place is well compensated for the awesome location. We were very happy with our experience there and, as a matter of fact, since our flight to L.A. leaves from Madrid and we'll have to spend one more night there after a month traveling, we canceled a reservation in another hotel, so we can stay there again that last night!", "Date": "June 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cVery good value\u201d", "Author": "paxmaruda", "ReviewID": "UR125283569", "Content": "It's a small hostal located in nice area full of good bars and restaurants.

I can't complain about shared bathrooms, they were clean all the time. Staff was friendly and spoke some English. I highly recommend this place.

Hostal location is rather good, close to Puerta del Sol, The Royal Palace and Plaza Mayor. An old Mercado with a lot of shops and small eateries is in front of the hostal. Hostal provides basic accommodation, we had a small twin room. Bathrooms were outside in a corridor. They didn`t serve breakfast. Towels were for hire and cost 1 euro. Much noise were heard from the street, especially at night. One should have in mind that they don`t have 24 hours reception. When we were leaving early in the morning we just dropped our room keys into a post box. As a whole we were satisfied as it was cheap, small place to stay with a good location to explore Madrid.", "Date": "January 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cIf you keep expectations low, it's great (!)\u201d", "Author": "IvanCDG", "ReviewID": "UR119424251", "Content": "This place is cheap and basically runs like a youth hostel, except that you have a private room to yourself.

Disappointing that there weren't any lockers in the rooms for you to lock away valuables but the location of this hostel more than made up for that. Directly opposite the Mercado San Miguel and with lots of great places surrounding to go for good food and good wine. There is however the problem with the other noisy travellers that stay here and also the noise from the outside recycling bins being emptied. However, personally, I did not find it a bother.

We'd only booked a room for 4 but got to a room for 6 all to our selves. The place looks recently done up. Although on the cheap. And it's clean and all. It's a hostal not a hostel so do not expect a great social element. However the bathrooms are shared and can run low on hot water. There's plenty of bathrooms all in decent to good condition so not much of a queue. The people running the place are nice and friendly. The place itself is just opposite the market in the plaza which is not as noise as you might expect but dont expect to sleep through the noise when the bins get emptied in the morning.

My boyfriend and I stayed in a private twin room for just 15 euros per person per night and the room was great - spacious with large windows looking out onto the sqaure, two comfortable beds and two fans, which certainly came in use! There is an indoor market and bars/restaurants on the square which of course creates noise but this stops around midnight. The hostel is between TWO supermarkets, which is very handy! The staff are also very friendly and helpful - we were put in the wrong room by mistake so when we arrived back at the hostel midnight, we were informed that reception staff had moved all our stuff into the other room and explained that there had been a mistake, which was fine.
