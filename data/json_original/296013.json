It's literally a five-minute walk from the Hagia Sophia (unless you have little kids like us - it's more like 12 minutes). The breakfast terrace on the roof has a view out to the Sea of Marmara. The hotel itself is on a side road without through traffic, so I imagine it is quieter than some of the hotels on the main roads in Sultanahmet. The service was fine. The breakfast was no-frills and I have had many better breakfasts in several other Turkish hotels. They arranged fairly-priced airport transfers for us, though, which was very convenient. We had the family room in the basement, which had a large bed, two singles, and a baby crib - it fit us fine and we didn't feel cramped. Even though it was in the \"basement,\" the slope of the road made it so we actually had a fairly picturesque view into the side roads of Sultanahmet. We did have a small problem with a few ants the first day or two, but it wasn't a big deal and it was taken care of quickly. Internet and TV worked fine. I'd recommend this place for the location and no-fuss quality (but the breakfast was nothing special).", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201c5 star location at 3 star prices!\u201d", "Author": "A L", "ReviewID": "UR123282912", "Content": "This hotel was such a find (thanks lonely planet!). Frankly, it is a bit underrated. The hotel is not too big which I liked as it gives a more personal experience. First, let me highlight the service at this hotel - every single one of the staff members was super helpful and friendly. Anything we asked about, they helped us with. Most importantly, they let us know that because of Ramadan, we needed to get a tour agent to help us with our travel plans because the day we were planning on travelling was a major holiday for the Turkish people and travel by bus and train would be near impossible. The location of this hotel was also ideal. It was just a hop away from the Topkapi palace and the Aya Sofya (Hagia Sophia). I cannot rave enough about the location! There is also a laundry shop just down the street which has reasonable prices and did a good job. The restaurants are all just down the street from the hotel. The room itself was nice - nothing super special, but comfortable and with air conditioning. There is a rooftop terrace where they have breakfast and you can enjoy the lovely views. We often went up there to just relax. The breakfast they served was plentiful and with fresh vegetables and fruits in addition to some meats and cheeses. Get there early though or they run out of the hard-boiled eggs - they only cook that once in the morning and once they run out, that is it. We highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again if ever back in Istanbul!", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "lechatlisse", "ReviewID": "UR122550924", "Content": "I stayed here with my mother and her husband a few months back and the reviews are right, it's a lovely place to stay.

The location of the Alp is right in Sultanamet, within 5 minutes you can be at the Blue Mosque or the Hagia Sofia. The area is filled with hostels and hotels and if you travel alone, like I do, this place is filled with locals and travels having beers at cafes so you will not be alone for long.

Perhaps we have been too spoilt by Turkish hospitality at our other stops that Alp Guesthouse failed miserably in that department. 4 star comfort combined with 1 star hospitality makes it an average 3 star. Rooms: Beautifully decorated and in good condition. Bathroom is clean but room on smallish side. Make sure you request for a room that is facing the street, not the mosque. The windows are not double glazed and you WILL be awoken at 4am. Alp guesthouse did not respond to my e-mail requests about street-facing room and that was a turn off for me. But it was too late for me to change hotels by that point. Upon check in, I asked again for a street-facing room and they said OK. I ended up with the mosque-facing room. Also note that not all rooms have sea view. Our room 404 did not. Hotel: Wonderful terrace with beautiful sea of marmaris views. Reception area is tiny. Price: On the higher side at 65E per double room. The most expensive hotel we stayed at in Turksy. Location: All hotels in the sultanhamet area are pretty much on the same street so you can't really go wrong. 5 min walk to Blue Mosque. Breakfast: Basic turkish buffet breakfast. No special items like borek or omelettes. Internet: Wireless internet did not work for us from our room (404). We had to sit in the stairwell to pick up the signal. The advertised \"Wired\" internet did not work from the rooms. The LAN outlet was not working and hotel management did not address concern about it. Service/Hospitality: This is where Alp scores low. When we arrived on the first day, we were not offered any tea or breakfast. Unlike the other pensions we stayed at in Turkey. Concerns about room location and internet were not addressed. Because the owner of the hotel was never there, it just felt like any old hotel. Not the homey turkish pensions we've become accustomed to. I get the feeling that all hotels in sultanhamet are going to lack in the hospitality department but I have heard good things about Apricot Hotel.
