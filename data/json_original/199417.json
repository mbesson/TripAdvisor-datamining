For the price could not really complain. Yes the passageways are tired looking, the entrance to the hotel is not impressive but this is not a 4 or 5 star hotel. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in the centre of Berlin, wants easy access to underground and has a limited budget. The one bedroom rooms are on the 5th floor and close to the restaurant where breakfast is served. We upgraded to the comfort rooms on the 2nd floor, as the first room we were given smelled of smoke. There are signs saying no smoking but obviously some choose to ignore them. The reception staff apologised and quickly found us another room. The beds are not very comfortable but standard basic hotel quality. From the airport take the airport express train to zoo gardens. Once you are outside the station look for the mercedes sign on the building roof & walk in that direction. The hotel is next door to the Saturn building. This is our 3rd trip to Berlin having stayed at Suite hotels before. We would return to Berliner Hof if we were to holiday there again, based on location and cost.

Transport links are good for the rail and underground links and the journey from Schonefeld by rail is around 1 hour with a few changes. The local area is excellent for shops, food and bars and the live music in the Irish Bar in the Europa Center is refreshingly close. The hotel is very basic. It has essentially had a lick of cheap paint in an attempt to make it less dull and dreary and this just left it looking somewhat pitiful. It is similar to sleeping in an old office building. The reception staff are efficient but nothing more. In no way is this a friendly place. The internet system is a ticket one where you purchase an hour or two and use that until it runs down after numerous uses. It is not cheap mind at 3 Euro for 2 hrs, 5 for 3 (makes no sense as that is actually more per hour) and 7.5 Euro for 5 hours. The connection is slow but stable. The rooms are tired and basic. They were though quiet although this may be because other people stayed somewhere better. No pictures on the walls just blank green/grey walls and a big uncomfortable bed which had two single mattresses which is terrible but made worse by the mattresses being evidently made of concrete. The duvets they provide are a joke as they simply provide two thin ones per bed; the cheapest that they could possibly have bought. The hallways of the place reminded me of a battleship in the uniform grey dullness. If I had been told i was staying in 1980's East Berlin I could have believed it.

The room was divided into two rooms, one with the bed an closet, and one with a couch, table and tv. A big minus about our room was that it had a horrible smell, but after a few days you got used to it. First i thought it was a smoking room, but i later realized that it probably wasn't. I wouldn't like to know what the smoking rooms smell like! We were traveling with another couple and therefore saw two of the rooms. (The othe room didn't smell as bad!) Our room had a view to the street, but we weren't disturbed by any noise. The shower and toilet was separated, which came in handy in the mornings. Our room also had a little kitchenette (which we didn't use). I am not sure if the other couple had that, i think not The location of the hotel is very central. Just about 100 meters from KaDeWe. The hotel entrance is not on the street, but almost a bit hidden inside a little \"passage\". And you had to ring a doorbell and talk to the receptionist in order to get into the hotel the first time. Therefor the first impression of the hotel was not really that great. The breakfast was good, but the served exactly the same every morning. Overall the hotel was ok, it could have been better, but the service was really nice!

The controlled entry is by way of a bell and reception is on the second floor. All the floors above that belong to the hotel and each room was, I am sure, an office unit in a previous life. That is no bad thing though, since it means the rooms are large and mine had a sitting area with a sofa and chairs. They serve breakfast (at extra cost) and it was adequate if unimaginative.

Our room was perfect, very clean, and designed well, allowing us to make use of a partition to allow us to relax,in fornt of the TV, when the children went to their cots. The cots and furnishing supplied were all great, and excellent double-glazing meant that whilst the hotel, is bang centre of a main street, there was no traffic noise, at all. The highlight for our daughter was the beautifully designed breakfast room. Bright and airy, this room presented a really nice way to kick off your day. We found the breakfast great for adults and babies alike, and never left hungry. The waitress staff, were all fantastic with our children, making them feel really special. One thing which really impressed me was the security in the hotel. Swipe cards had to be used to access the front/corridor and room doors, not that I felt particularly intimidated at any time, but it's worth mentioning if you are travelling on your own. My only criticism was with the hotel's housekeeping and reception staff. We asked for replacement coffee and spare nappies (which the hotel says they can provide on their web-site) and the coffee never arrived, and they had no nappies left. We asked about train times to the airport, and the details supplied were wrong, which meant we missed the train we\u2019d like to have caught, and ended up with a lot of clock watching as set on the later train, airport bound\u2026not the ideal way to end a holiday when you\u2019ve toddlers in tow. All in all we were happy enough with our experience, that on our next visit to this great city, we'll be staying in the same hotel again.", "Date": "September 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan, Italy", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "Silverino", "ReviewID": "UR19247357", "Content": "My girlfriend and I spent four days at the Berliner Hof in August 2008 and we were very happy.

The bathroom had a bathtub and was very clean.

My overall impression was good and I would happily stay here again. Having read the other reviews here, its difficult to know what else to say, so my main good and bad points are: I paid 110 euro per night for a large room, with separate toilet and bathroom; small kitchen area (sink, fridge, kettle, plates and utensils); a separate (small) living room (sofa, tv, working table); a bedroom sandwiched between corridor from bathroom/door to the living room area. Positive things: - Location excellent for transportation, shops, restaurants, bars, etc - Room was big enough - Door between living room (where windows are) and bedroom, meant quiet sleep - Internet (paid, not free), both Wi-Fi and wired - Nice breakfast, better than the standard German fair - Staff nice and helpful - Lots of TV stations including CNN and BBC World - Price / value for money Negative things: - No bar/lobby/meeting area - No restaurant for evening meals.

Metro station was within 5 minutes walk, and a bus from the trade show in the evening stopped near hotel. I visited couple of other hotels in the city. The amenities in 4 star hotels were similar to Berliner- Hof, but the location was much further from the center, and the price was higher. I would definitely recommend Berliner Hof as a good value, safe and quiet place in Berlin.

This hotel forms part of the Europa Center in the former West of Berlin very near to Zoo U Bahn and S Bahn Stations. Firstly must comment on the hotel entrance-DO NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. It is literally steps away from one of Berlin's main streets Tauzienstrasse and couldn't be more centrally placed for shops, nightlife, restauarants and transport links etc. Saying this however the access point is via a narrow shopping arcade adjacent to Pizza Hut which doesn't look very thrilling. The entrance looks very sparse and bland but the lift takes you straight to the main reception on an upper floor and once there the hotel is an absolute pleasure.... Very sleek and modern, clean lines, quality furnishing, impeccably clean and staff are all very pleasant and welcoming. Breakfast is served on the top floor in a superb breakfast room which was a joy to dine in. So clean and modern, staff replenish buffet speedily. Excellent choice and variety, modern furniture, very reminiscent of IKEA or Radisson SAS at altogether realistic prices for a Capital City Centre hotel. We've stayed in other Berlin hotels over seven years which were equally as conformtable but the room rates per night were far more- hence the Berliner Hof was a gem at a fair price.
