The rooms are basic with some of the essential facilities including a safe and hair dryer. Could have done with coffee making facilities but with the many cafes/bars within easy reach it really wasn't a problem. The shower was excellent...just what was needed after a day pounding the streets! Cleanliness was spot on...our room was cleaned every day, beds made & fresh towels. Contrary to their appearance the beds were very comfy! Breakfast was average...very little choice, and coffee from a machine was poor...again not so much of an issue with the facilities available in the locality. Locality was good, a 20 minute walk to the key sites and close to the metro. Cleaning staff and receptionist on arrival were really pleasant and helpful. The free map from reception was invaluable. However, breakfast staff were unhelpful, they didn't greet us in the morning and just stood and watched whilst we struggled with the coffee machine. Finally, the gentleman on reception as we checked out put a dampener on what was otherwise a great stay - we were unaware of the 2\u20ac per night city tax (not in the guide books or advised by travel agent) - whilst we were happy to pay the 12\u20ac he was incredibly grumpy about the fact that we didnt have the correct change and made no effort to find any making us feel quite uncomfortable. Overall, this hotel does exactly as it says on the tin, it's great value for money and we would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "billingham,teesside", "Title": "\u201cgood choice\u201d", "Author": "jonboysxi", "ReviewID": "UR122619758", "Content": "real good location,cheap and cheerfull stay had no complaints was clean and tidy and good location to get around,metro just a few mins walk down the street,would use again", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "alabama", "Title": "\u201cUnremarkable lodging at the right price\u201d", "Author": "tomcat408", "ReviewID": "UR119255318", "Content": "The Hotel Louisiana is an older hotel on the 4th floor of an older building.

The breakfast is the usual Italian breakfast fare--breads, fruits, coffee, etc. It is a reasonable walk to the city bus route, the hop on hop off bus and La Repubblica Metro. Our main complaint was the noise from the street below. There is a ristorante located nearby and the rowdy crowd kept going until the wee hours.

I guess they used the air freshener to cover up the fact that all their rooms where smoking rooms, which was not mentioned in our booking site. To be honest the hotel did not really pick up after that! It is a 1 star hotel, and do not expect anything else! If you are in the habit of enjoying hot showers I hardly recommend to be out of bed before 8 in the morning, or you have to wait until 14.00.

It was a decent part of town and a convenient location to walk from the train (less than a kilometer). The reception desk was upstairs, which is strange and not perfectly labelled, but there is an elevator to haul luggage up. The hotel staff was adequately helpful, though I wouldn't give them any service awards. The room was clean enough, though the furniture was cheap and seemed easily breakable. There were scuff marks on the walls, which could be easily spruced up with some paint. The bathroom was big enough, though the shower head was old and leaky and the accordion doors didn't want to stay closed. The water temperature fluctuated quite a bit and the shower stall was quite small...smaller than other European hotels we've stayed. There was wifi available in the common area only, and was a little finicky to connect, but usually did so after some waiting. There was an outdoor area in the center of the building which was nice for sitting and relaxing in the evening and checking email, but smokers and mosquitos did hinder our enjoyment.

What I disliked was the fact that the wireless was working only at the first flour, but even if I managed to get a poor connection, at this floor I didn't have network for the telephone! So in fact I did not have any wireless working! Another bad thing was the breakfast - very poor and only sweet, cold things - cold croissants, jam, honey, butter, cereals with cold milk, bad cofee and juice- I hated it from the first day and hated it more every day.

Breakfast OK, once I'd mastered the coffee machine, with plenty of rolls and various types of croissants. 10 mintues walk from Termini station and we walked easily to the Spanish Steps, the Trevi fountain and Barberini Palace. We enjoyed several meals at the nearby trattorias on Via Castelfidardo and Via R Cadonna. We did try the Henry Cow opposite on the first night because it is so close, but wouldn't really recommend it and were irritated by the number of hawkers interrupting our meal.

Clearly when our travel agent made the booking she had no idea how appalling & dirty the rooms were.

With 4 of us & double the amount of luggage it took forever & was quicker to lug some of it up the stairs. The rooms were dingy, smelly, the walls were dirty, the shower curtain was all ripped & the bathroom ceiling was covered in mould (just look at the photo). To top it all off the air conditioning was on high but let out warm air which was horrific in mid June. If you look at the website the rooms look simple but clean & I cannot believe how they can get away with such false advertising. I don't blame our travel agent as she obviously went by what she saw on the website. If you stay in Rome please take my advise & do not stay at this hotel.

The hotel is located in the Termini area of Romes' city centre only a few hundred yards from the Termini station itself. I have to say that we were a little worried as just after we had booked the hotel, I came across this website and there were 2 reviews about Hotel Louisiana. One was quite good and one quite bad! we need not have worried as we thought it was great. The entrance of the hotel is literally just an entrance with nothing but the doorway stairs and a lift. The Building actually houses a number of hotels so it is a communal entrance and the reception for Hotel Louisiana is up the stairs on the first floor. When we arrived in Rome late in the morning we were too early for check in so we found the hotel and left our luggage there and went to explore a little. The rooms are quite small with a couple of feet either side of the bed but more than adequate. we had enough wardrobe space. The bathroom had a toilet, bidet, shower and sink but no bath and wasnt too pokey. The room and bathroom were both very clean and nicley decorated. The towels in the bathroom were all replaced with fresh ones everyday, even those which had been hung up to be reused. There was a hairdryer and shaving point in there also. There was an easy to use control point to adjust the heating and air conditioning levels. There was also a digital radio system and a flat screen TV which both worked fine. Breakfast was dissapointing but to be honest a continental breakfast even in the ritz would have been too. They just arn't enough for me. A Continental breakfast traditionally is bread, rolls or croissants and butter and perhaps jam, coffee and tea. Anywhere that offers anything else like cereals, ham and cheese etc then simply isnt a continental breakfast, they perhaps add those because Brits and Americans usually have more substantial breakfasts. The croissants and rolls were fresh but the for drinks there is a machine which are best avoided like the plague if you like quality tea or coffee. The Termini area is supposidley the 'worst' area to stay in the centre of Rome and thus why it is the cheapest. I never at any time felt threatened or unsafe.
