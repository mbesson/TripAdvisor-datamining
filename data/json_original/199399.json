Want a cup of coffee or tea in your room? 1,50 Euro. Want to take the shuttle to the airport? Pay the Euros!

Second, the showers have a sign to be mindful of the changes in water temperature. Understatement. My showers were borderline dangerous due to the extreme variations in temperature.

Despite its 4-star rating and ambience - lots of glass everywhere - there were several flaws. The rooms had white curtains - a simple mistake that means waking with sunrise - very annoying.

You can do a lot worse than this hotel, but you can also do a lot better. As regards location, you're fairly near the airport, but not near anythign else of use.
