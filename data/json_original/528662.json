The problem with turning up at a cheap, non-air-conditioned big city hotel on a steaming hot day is that the room will have basked in the sun, and heated to the temperature of a sauna. Which is what we got. The room itself had a slightly scuffed, well-worn look about it, but was clean and comfortable, with only a few long black hairs among the clean towels to let down overall impression. We opened the window wide and went out for the evening hoping it would cool down a bit, and reckless to the security of our belongings. The night was still a hot one, and so the window stayed open. Unfortunately, the night staff seemed to have had friends in who talked and laughed into the small hours outside - not unreasonably loud, but just loud enough to keep a fragile sleeper awake. The next morning we went down to the the basement again for breakfast. Here the staff were delightful, and the breakfast which took you back to the old pre-self-service days was excellent.

It's not a Marriot Hotel with huge rooms, but I'd imagine to get that in London you'd have to rob a bank or stay near the airport. Re: the water pressure: as far as I could tell, the toilets simply work differently in London, we found wherever we went during the day that they just don't seem to \"flush,\" so that appears to be a London-wide issue. And really, we were in London to sightsee, not to hang out in the room. We had a double and a single bed in our room, as well as a desk and a wardrobe and three night tables, so really, all the room we needed for sleeping and watching a bit of TV later in the evening. Breakfast gets a bit crowded by 8:30 (ends at 9am) so we tried to get downstairs by 8:00-8:15. You can get the full English breakfast, which we did once, but mainly we just had an egg and toast. You can ask for whatever combination you like. Fill up on toast, and you won't need lunch til early afternoon!

They also supply a plug adapter and watt converter, as well as a blowdryer (found them in the desk drawer.) We had a room on the garden side, but don't imagine it was all birds chirping: this is central London, and Gower St. is a major road, and even the garden side has a road beyond it that seems to be a late night shortcut, so there was traffic noise all night, much like any big city, so if you're a light sleeper, consider earplugs. I loved the age and history of the building, but it's not a modern cement walled hotel, meaning you can hear your neighbours, so we tried to keep the TV down after 10pm.

There is a great italian restauant around the corner and many other pubs and restaurants with in easy reach if you dont want to wander far. Now for the staff. They are mostly eastern european ( as you would expect ) and the young man who checked us in was lovely and very helpful. When we ventured down into the basement for breakfast we were served by a sucsession of nice young ladies who were dressed up for a night on the town instead of waitressing. They were pleasant and bought some nice cooked breakfast ( bacon too salty ) but they brightened up our morning !!!!! The owner of the establishment was a large cheerful Polish man that made us laugh. His sense of humour was a little strange at times and he was a real character.

However, we chose it for the location, which was great for the West End and shopping. There was traffic noise from the road but that's hard to avoid in central London. The bed was lovely and comfy and the bathroom had been recently partially updated despite being very compact. The bedroom itself was small too but that's often the case in London. The decor was a bit shabby and the fixtures a bit worn and outdated eg old TV with missing remote, mismatched bedside lamps, unfashionable wardrobe but it was clean, comfy and warm (important in February!). I got the impression that the hotel was constantly busy and they just didn't get a chance to update the rooms and almost didn't see a need to if they are that busy which is fair enough I suppose. However, this sounds very negative and the hotel was really very friendly and helpful from when we first arrived to when we left. Breakfast was yummy too and if you opted for the continental breakfast, it looked like you actually got a really good option for once with nice yoghurts and a good selection of cheeses considering the hotel only has a few rooms. Good coffee too. The breakfast room could have been improved with tablecloths on the lovely formica tables and some newer crockery because it really was a throwback to the 70's but as I said before, I can't fault the quality, just the decor! This hotel is good for a stopover for one or maybe two nights but I probably wouldn't want to stay any longer than that as it would be a bit too small.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "shropshire", "Title": "\u201cPleasantl Suprised\u201d", "Author": "ShropshireCharlie", "ReviewID": "UR13169310", "Content": "found this hotel in a quieter location of central london a pleasant surprise. staff were VERY helpful. room was clean and kept tidy during our 4 day stay.

The carpet and sheets were clean, there was a little dust all over the furniture, but more than acceptable. From our windows we could see the nice garden of the hotel, we suggest to ask for a room facing the back side of the Hotel (as our was) as Goodge street is a main road quite noisy. The overall feeling you have in the hotel is of a quite old B&B, a little drab maybe, but which has all the comforts you can ask for in a short stay in town.(for 99 pounds per night in triple) The breakfast was super, the english breakfast was well cooked but they also had good marmalades, jams and scones. The staff was really friendly and helping. The hotel does not have a reception desk, they have a small office in the lower floor.

We were very pleasantly surprised by the size of the room (compared to other rooms we have had in London hotels in previous visits). The bathroom was not smaller than we expected and was very clean. Plenty of clean towels were supplied daily. The smell of breakfast wafted up to the room every morning, but this only served to whet our appetites. The room was well-equipped and has a wireless internet facilitiy. The hotel is situated in a very nice area (see street photo included with this review) and the location is excellent and central. The English breakfast was lavish as promised by the photo on the hotel site. Apart from the egg, bacon, beans, tomato, mushroom & sausage it also includes plenty of toast, juices, tea/coffee, jams, marmalade and a variety of cheeses. Staff were extremely helpful and went out of their way to solve a problem we had with our laptop which could not connect to their wireless internet (presumably due to some settings on our laptop because theirs was working fine), and they did not give up until the problem was solved, calling our room more than once to check that everything was fine.
