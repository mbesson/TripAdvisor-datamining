Its true that it is shabby but we found it to be fairly clean and you couldn't ask for a better location. We have been to London many times and we had always stayed on the other side of Hyde Park so we were pleasantly surprised by the easy access to shops, transport and museums etc. We didn't mind the fact that there was no breakfast because there were cooking facilities in our little apartment so we could make tea and coffee etc. Although there was not much in the way of cook wear or crockery. We paid 70 pounds per night for a studio apartment which we felt was very reasonable. Its no Hilton that's for sure but we really only wanted somewhere reasonably priced and convenient and it was fairly clean.

Thanks to the reviews on this site, we expected what we got: budget accommodations with a separate kitchen and bath, horrible decor and old carpets/wall paper, and only somewhat clean. The linens were clean but frayed, the bathroom was fairly clean, but because it was warm and there is no a.c., the windows were left open a lot. London air is dirty, and all surfaces collect dust, which the cleaning people do not take care of. The location is great - 5 minutes walk from Kensington High underground station, close to groceries stores, and Naz, the main front desk help, was great for information and extra help.

Then, when we finally heard something, it was from a different person who upped the rate. The third and final email upped the rate again and also informed us that two of our nights were no longer available--so more per night for a shorter stay.

Cheap, convienent to tube and good shops. The staff are VERY friendly and helpful. While I do recommend the Clearlake the one downside is the fact that there's no breakfast.

We knew from other reviews to not expect the best room. We had also booked one of the cheaper studio rooms (#5), but we were given the chance to inspect the room before paying so we knew what we were getting into. Yep, it had old torn wallpaper and old carpet, but the room had been cleaned. They cleaned the room and left fresh towels daily. I have arthritis in my spine and was concerned about the beds, but they were comfortable even in the old studio. The staff was very helpful and honest! I paid by traveler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s check and one of my checks had stuck to another one. The staff returned it to me when they discovered the error. Laundry was done the same the day and at a low cost compared to other hotels we stayed in. The location was great! Tube was 3 blocks away with plenty of shopping and small grocery stores. Also nearby was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Easy Internet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd store that allowed you to buy an hour of Internet time with a code with a password which allowed you to log off and back on anytime you came in the store. One of the few Internet stores you actually got to use all the time you paid for and could come and go as you needed. Having Kensington Palace and the park next door was great when you got back from site seeing and just wanted a walk through a park. Several museum including the A & V are in walking distance. Although it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the Hilton, the Clearlake hotel staff was great and this was a reasonably priced room in an area where other hotels were charging 200 GBP per night.

Based on previous reviews and pictures on the hotel's website, I wasn't expecting much more than basic accommodation and a good location. We stayed in unit 15, two bedrooms (comfortable beds), two bathrooms, small kitchen and a large living room. Great view of Kensington Park. The carpeting and furniture are dated, but clean enough. The place feels more like you are borrowing a friend's flat than staying in a hotel room. The trade off on current finishes and fresh paint is space - lots of space. There were four of us, two parents and two kids, and we didn't feel like we were tripping over each other. Quite a difference from the postage-stamp sized hotel rooms we have rented in the past (at about the same price, too). Staff was friendly and helpful with recommendations for restaurants and making arrangements for transport to Heathrow. Convenience store, grocery, and bus/tube all within a couple of minutes walk.
