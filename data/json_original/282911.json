{"Reviews": [{"Content": "An adequate hotel at a reasonable price The hotel generally is lovely. The resort of Santa Susanna is small and quiet (especially in low season as we were there in November). The rooms are not the biggest I've stayed in, but are clean and well furnished. The food was good at breakfast and dinner, and the drink was reasonably priced. My one complaint is that the hotel charges for absiolutley EVERYTHING! I've never stayed in a hotel before that charges residents to use their pool (6 euro per head per day). Towels are 1.20 euro (not a deposit to ensure you return it, but a charge). And they really put the arm in if you need a late check-out! I could go on. We had paid extra for a superior room which we did not get. I've got my travel agent sorting out a refund now. These few issues really coloured my overall impression of the hotel. However the lobby is spacious and very clean, generally the staff are friendly and helpful, and the surrounding area is very pleasant.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR909879646", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "nrc75"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel Just returned from a 6 night stay with our two children aged 8 and 11.

We chose Santa Susana having stayed in Lloret de Mar earlier in the year. We liked the area, but were keen to avoid the Htop hotels as we stayed in one in Lloret and it was terrible, no where near 4 star. This hotel, however, is worthy of the 4 star rating, how 2 hotels in the same area can get the same rating was beyond us. The hotel has a smoking ban, which was great for us. Check in was swift and efficient and we went off to our room. This had 2 double beds and was of an average size. There was a full bathroom with shampoo, bath creme, soap, comb, shower cap and tissues. It was spotlessly clean. The room was cleaned daily and this was always to a high standard.We stayed full board. Breakfast was as expected, cereals, cold meats etc, fruit (this did not exist in our Htop earlier in the year be warned) full cooked, juice, tea coffee etc. Lunch was a buffet, as was dinner. The selection was varied from curry to roast, fish, various casserole type dishes. For starters there were soups and salads. Desserts saw a variety of cold choices, fruit, cakes and home baked biscuits. Drinks were extra. The service was efficient while we were there. The prices were 5.15 euros for 50cl house wine or 8.75 for a bottle of house wine. Water was 1.70 euros and coke 2 euros. The location of the hotel was good. It was right on the promenade and very close to the train station. There was a small indoor pool which we used, but in my opinion , at 6 euros was quite pricey for a small pool which was very crowded. there were several teenagers not behaving as they should have been which spoilt it for other users. Not the hotels fault, but parents who seemed absent from sight. We have teenagers so are not unrealistic. The hotel also charges 4 euros per day to use the car park. This is opposite the hotel and although it has a barrier I am not sure that is was any better patrolled than any other car park there! You could park in the adjacent area whcih we did, free.All in all we had a good break here. we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends. we travel abroad about 4 times per year so are fairly experienced in the standard to expect from hotels.

(That said, we would still recommend it to vegetarian friends.) Again, given the scale of the dining room, lukewarm food and empty platters were relatively rare. I'm not sure I'd have liked to be there during peak holiday periods though, as when it did get busier at the weekend things did slow down and we had finished our meal before we were given a chance to order drinks one night.The location was superb - the proximity to the train station made it ideal for getting further afield, whether in to Barcelona or just to/from neighbouring resorts. We would have liked to visit the little market outside in the evening for a stroll but baby's bedtime didn't permit.

My other main criticism would be that the hotel has some good facilities, but all of them will cost you extra Euros which is not clear when you book! eg the table tennis, indoor pool, safe in room, the list goes on. Also beware there is no iron available for guests to borrow so we were forced to use their expensive in-house laundry service.Having said that, the rooms are clean and well maintained and the breakfast was a good spread.Hotel staff and locals in general appear to be sick to death of tourists so don't expect to be charmed.

We accepted this and went to our room.On arrival at our room we were greated by a very bad damp smell, which we found out was being casued by the bathroom fan not working. As it was only for one night we opened the balcony doors to freshen up the room, we also put a card in the power unit so that the Air con stayed on perminantly even when we werent in the room.The balconies on the 5th floor which the hotel claim are child safe, are NOT child safe, the gap between the bar on the railings are big enough for our son to get through so make sure if you have children or a young age you do not let the hotel give you a room on the 5th floor.It took the hotel 2 days to move us to a room on a lower floor.The room we moved to was 100% better than the first room, it was bigger with two double beds, didnt smell as the fan in the bathroom was working and the balcony was a lot safer as it was half brick and half railings.We had no more complaints about our room for the whole holiday.The hotel itself was great the food was nice, and had a good selection. the staff were very friendly, and all spoke english as well as many other languages.The area is a purpose built area full of hotels and shops, the hotel is about a 5 min walk to thebeach and 10 mins to the man centre.However I wouldnt recommend the beach as it isnt really sandy more really small stones, and the centre is full of shops that sell the same thing again and again.I would however recommend the night stalls that go all the way along the street at the front of the hotel these were lovely, and they sold goods that were unigue and had very friendly people running them. (I can recommend the brazillian cocktails)The pool at the hotel was nice, although it was a bit cold. the entertainment staff were nice. Although the bar at the hotel had very slow service, and there were only 2 other tables being used when we were there.Altogether the hotel was clean, friendly and a very nice hotel for a family, I would deffinatley reccomend this hotel for families with children between 4 and 10.the hotel management need to look at all their rooms and make sure they are all up to the same standards. the bad room we had was 512 (just incase the hotel staff are wandering, oh and the phone didnt work in the room, and although i reported it, they never fixed this for the 2 days we were in the room.Hope I havent put any one off this hotel as it is a great hotel, just that we had a few issues.

If your looking for a fab hotel by Spanish Costa's standards this is it! When you walk into the reception the marble flooring is beautiful and the first thing that hits you is how fresh and clean the place is.Rooms are spotless, fresh and we had two lovely double beds. Toilet / bathroom was also spotless, had a nice shower and bath and the worktop and basin where as good as you'd get at a quality hotel back home. Pool area also excellent, jacuzzi, kids pool and standard pool are cleaned daily and there is a pool bar and some nice soft seats in a shaded area.If you have kids with you there is a smallish games room, but you can use the sister hotel Aquamarina 5 mins walk away that has a huge games room down in the basement.Dining, usual Spanish set up, buffet style but with excellent choice. Good choice if your vegan or if you want to try some european dishes. Breakfasts are fantastic, great choice of fruit, cereals and cooked breakfasts. I heard a few comments from folk complaining about the waiting staff and clearing up. It tells you on the Hotel literature that the dining area closes sharply, the hotel operates on a full board basis for guests. So obviously they want to get tidied up and get onto the following service. I don't have a problem with that.I cannot for the life of me understand why people complain about hotels having other foreign nationals in it, it add's to the atmosphere. EURO 2008 was on and the staff erected two large screens for the evening games and the atmosphere was great with all the different nationals. If your looking for a stricly English speaking Hotel you'd be better staying at home.This is a fantastic hotel if you want a rest.

The hotel staff are extremely helpful and offer a high level of service. Excellent size room on the 4th floor with good size balcony with sea view and exceptionally clean through out. I booked on a half board basis which I would recommend, excellent selection of buffet service although I'm sure if you were there for 2 weeks it would become a bit repetitive. The hotel receives prominent Dutch, Russian and Eastern European tourists to the area. (There is little choice of restaurants in the resort to eat out otherwise. )Good size pool and there was always enough loungers for everyone. The only downside for us was the hotel entertainment, this caters mostly for families. As a couple in our mid 30's, we could have done with abit more variety. A walk along the front with the nightly craft  jewellery stalls was great and if you walk to the 'Disco Ok' end , there was some good musicians playing in other hotels.The resort of Santa Susanna is perfect for those looking for a fairly quiet holiday. It has great train links for the other coastal resorts and of course Barcelona. We spent 2 days in Barcelona and there was still more we wanted to see. Santa Susanna is more purposely built for the tourists, with not much of the authentic spain to see in the main town.

This hotel is definitely one full star better than the Florida Park (currently rated number 2 on this site). The only plus point for Florida Park is that it is about 250 yards nearer to the life and tacky shops. Thinking about it, maybe not a plus point since this area has become more and more full of tacky shops.The Onabrava was better 2 years ago, i seem to rememeber the nightly hotel entertainment was ok then for about 4 nights (amazing for this area of Spain), this visit only one night was acceptable, Oh how i wish i had Simon Cowells buzzer to get the rubbish off the stage.The sunbed contraptions all need replacing, poor design and many broken. Also get your towels on the beds before 9.30 am or you will miss out.The restaurant staff seem to be on some proficiency bonus, who can clear the most plates in an evening before the customers have finished!!!The food choice is excellent but after 10 days one realises the quality is not so good. Food is not always hot, breakfast baked beans are always lukewarm and vegetables in the evening are very poor and sometimes inedible, seven nights i ate chips with my main course because the other potato choices were poorly cooked or corrupted by some regurgitated sauce yuk!The smart Germans who used to stay here seemed to have reduced in numbers, the British contigent is also smaller than before, both have been replaced by Eastern Europeans and Russians, several travel companies ferrying them to Santa Susana seem to have started up recently - it does not bode well for the future. Standards are slipping - i saw at least a dozen men in shorts and some in singlets at dinner, most women look dressed more for shopping than dining - this was never the way 2 years ago, guests would have been told to dress properly and refused entry. This is not just an Onabrava problem, I witnessed it at Florida Park this time also.Having said all that, the hotel onabrava rooms are excellent, the place is modern and spotless, the staff polite and friendly.I will not return to this area of Spain again, once it had a naive charm but now it has developed into a weekly cheap coach trippers resort, not my choice but if that is what you want then Santa Susana will welcome you. Two other points,- if you are visiting this area cling onto your wallet/handbag at all times, there is a continuous queue at the police station of visitors reporting thefts, this area had little crime a couple of years ago- when you trip over the uneven pavements and break your wrist or damage your ankle, I am informed by three people i met (all in plaster), the hospital at Callela (2 train stops away) is excellent and makes our NHS look pathetic (not particularly difficult), some consolation for your injuries i guess.Compared to other hotels in this area i should rate it as excellent but it is in UK terms a 3/4 star hotel which looks very good because it is in a poor area.and yes i am a grumpy old git................................", "Date": "Jun 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR940973593", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "i_am_grumpy_old_git"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Hotel!

The location of the hotel was especially good -- right along the main promenade of Santa Susanna, just a short walk to the train or to the ocean. The train takes you into Barcelona in an hour, so it's a good place to stay if you want to take a day trip (as we did). Santa Susanna is a nice little touristy town, with your standard trinket shops and the obligatory British pub. It's a safe town as well, we had no concerns walking at night. Now, if you're looking for a hotel in the lap of luxury with everything in the hotel of the highest possible quality -- then this isn't the place for you.
