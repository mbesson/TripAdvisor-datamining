I felt less than a man bringing my family here. The different receptionists were nice, if not for their sake I would suggest they close the place down. They actually charge 3 euro an hour for wifi! How ridiculous. If you want a push to spend time away from the hotel stay here. I only wish that I would have checked reviews before I booked.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tenerife", "Title": "\u201cVery, very basic.

It would be fine for backpackers, except for the outrageous price of EUR \u20ac75 per night. It should be about EUR \u20ac20. Saying that, it's clean and has hot water. The bed was OK. There was an overhead fan, but it squeaked so we couldn't have it on. Hand held shower whilst standing in a bath. The shutters had holes so the room was fairly light. it's near a very busy road so quite noisy. Free parking for guests. Didn't have the breakfast because we just wanted to get out!", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201csleazy, dull, bad ethics\u201d", "Author": "MariaAmsterdam", "ReviewID": "UR10104664", "Content": "I stayed only one night in this overpriced, sleazy-looking hotel next to a busy motorway in an outskirt of Rome, after that I fled.
