The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, the rooms were all recently renovated with a very nice, modern look, and the place honestly felt like a home away from home. If any issues arose, management got on them right away to make sure they were taken care of immediately. The kitchen is another good feature, helping the room feel like home while also controlling dining costs during your stay. The location is ideal too as it's situated right between the 805 and 15 freeways, with the 56 just slightly to the north - this made it really easy to get anywhere in the San Diego area.
