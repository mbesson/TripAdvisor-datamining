It is family run and is not big or fancy, but the welcome from the manager/owner and the way he did whatever he could to help us enjoy our stay was unusual in its level of warmth (and I used to review hotels for a job!). The room was small and quirky - two armchairs fitted so neatly into one little ante-room that there was no room for our legs if we chose to sit in them, but the choice of three tiny balconies and views of the sea made up for that. (MInd you, the view of the sea involved looking over a semi-derelict building site, and if anyone builds a house there, the view will be gone!) The Berce is in a quiet side street a five-minute walk away from the main sights of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia, so you are near the sights but also get the feeling of being in a neighbourhood as well. There is a corner shop nearby where we bought bread and cheese and olives and tomatoes, beer and wine for a mellow picnic. The breakfast at the hotel is simple but honest and good (the standard fare of yoghurt, honey, eggs, bread, olives, tomatoes, sausage and coffee), and served on a roof terrace which gives a view of the sea in one direction and a view of the Blue Mosque in another - that's the kind of view we were paying well over the odds for at fancy restaurants nearby. The Berce was also relatively affordable (by Istanbul standards) and when we compared notes with colleagues staying in other hotels in the city, we had a reassuringly warm feeling that we had fallen on our feet with the Berce.

The Rooms are lovely, furnished with luscious towels and crisp bed linens! The hotel staff bends over backwards to accommodate your needs! The food is exceptional Turkish fare: a lovely breakfast spread of their refreshing yogurt, the best real honeycomb honey (not to be missed), various fresh fruits and juicy vegetables, cheeses olives, dried fruitsj and cereals, delightful omelets, as well as local cheese pastries, breads, good coffee and a fine selection of tea! I was room- bound due to an injury ( not related to my hotel stay) and the staff checked on me without being asked, brought ice for my ankle, brought me lunch from the dining room and were exceptionally solicitous! The hotel owner checked in with us every morning and several times guided us to our destination! Meals and cocktails are enjoyed on the rooftop terrace and deck which overlook the Bosphorous and the Marmora Sea. Ship and yacht watching is enjoyed by all. There is always hot water in the bathroom and the plumbing is reliable! The Berce is wonderfully situated on a quiet, narrow cobblestone street in Sultanamet, an easy walk to many of the tourist attractions. Because the hotel is quite small ( maybe 10 rooms) the atmosphere is exceptionally friendly and accommodating. They feel like family by the time you leave! The decor is lovely with lots of beautiful Turkish carpets everywhere!", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cOUR STAY IN BERCE HOTEL WAS MEMORABLE!!\u201d", "Author": "abs1969", "ReviewID": "UR103062010", "Content": "Mr Mehmet (the Manager) & his team were very warm and helpful . the hotel is ideally located due to its proxmity to all the important tourist destinations in Sultanamet area .", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utrecht, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cI've been to many hotels in Istanbul, but I really enjoyed the Berce Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "babs3155", "ReviewID": "UR102453630", "Content": "I've been to many hotels in Istanbul, but I really enjoyed the Berce Hotel.

Berce Hotel is clean and they served a wonderful breakfast on the roof, the girls make it every day fresh. In summertime the breakfast is on the roof terras. The view is fascinating, you can overview the Marmara and the bosporus with the big ships, and when the weather is good you can see the prinses islands. Also you can see the big mosques. The owners and staff are very warm and kindly, they help you in every possibly way, it can be with directing the way, or by advising what to see and how to travel. The hotel is in the characteristic Sultanameth in a piece full street, a few minutes walking from all the important buildings, such as mosques and grand bazaar. I will go there next time, i can't get a better price and quality then there. Hope I created a good picture for you and you will check it out yourself.

We were originally looking at the Hilton since you have a pretty idea as to what your getting yourself into when travelling in Europe/Asia. However, this hotel is in the prime spot of Istanbul, you can walk to the sites and all of the dense civilization within 10 mins. With the hilton and other major hotels, you either have to cab it, or take public transport, which is fine, but a waste of time. Also those hotels were around 30-40% higher, not worth it. Check-in was easy as \"Mehmet\" was quite knowledgeable about the area. He recommended a restaraunt close by and since it was pretty late, we decided to try it. Good place, but after that we ventured on our own. The hotel had complimentary breakfast which was convenient and free wireless internet in our room. We didn't utilize anything else in the hotel. The area seems very residential and quiet, but within a few blocks, your at the sites. It was also easy to get a taxi for our early morning flight (which we had to leave at 4am). Getting to the hotel from the airport wasn't that difficult either, though I recommend a taxi from SAW since the hotel shuttle takes an extra hour, and is only worth it if its just you. From IST, you can use public transport since there is a tram/train stop close by, you can also taxi from the nearest train stop as well.

The next day we moved to a lovely room complete with sitting area and 3 small balconies. It would be easy to imagine staying here comfortably for an extended stay. Mehmet told us his goal is to make the Berce feel more like home than a hotel and he has succeeded. With its great view of both the Blue Mosque and Sea of Marmara, the rooftop breakfast terrace was a beautiful way to begin the day.", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Al Khobar", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay in the old part of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "NickKhobar", "ReviewID": "UR44421805", "Content": "I spent nine days in this wonderful small hotel within easy walking distance of the tram, Grand Bazar, Blue Mosque etc. The rooms are very comfortable, light and airy. They were very clean and the sheets and towels beautifully white and clean. The room had been very recently decorrated and furnished, with Turkish carpets covering the wood floor. The ensuite bathroom was small, modern and pleasant. Both airconditioning and central heating were available. On the top floor (up a spiral staircase) there is a pleasant breakfast terrace with both inside and outside seating and a great view of the Bosphorous. The management was very friendly, professional and helpful.

Given how inexpensive the hotel was, I expected it to be very basic. I was pleasantly surprised at how nicely appointed the hotel was. Nicely furnished, new appliances and furnishings, LCD tv, great breakfast, free internet, and very conveniently located. Mehmet at the front desk was incredibly helpful with calling cabs, giving directions, and generally helping out. The only thing wrong with my room was that the window didn't close properly. However, the area is so quiet that it wasn't a problem. Definitely a great place to stay!", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Berce Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1392958-Reviews-Berce_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$112 - $144*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kucukayasofya mahallesi.
