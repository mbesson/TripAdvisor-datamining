My room had a a view looking directly onto the Ayasofya mosque and cobbled street below, with safe, air conditioning and en-suite bathroom. When booking, it might be wise to ask for the second or top floor; I stayed on the first floor which was fine. My room was quiet and had no passing traffic as it is in a zone prohibited to vehicles. Air conditioning worked well, and helped keep the errant couple of mosquitoes at bay. The hotel staff booked taxis which arrived within minutes. Breakfast was buffet style with a good selection on offer. The rooms had nice varnished hardwood floors, but there is too much furniture in the room to appreciate this well. Rooms were clean but for two people, my double would have been a bit of a squeeze if you wanted to have a good sleep.

Murat Ozturk, the manager, and Mrs. Fulya, are by now very dear friends, and, while I can be demanding sometimes, have never been anything but the most courteous, helpful, supportive and wonderful of hosts. And, while I have found this more the norm than the exception in my almost 80 visits (so far!) to Turkey, they still seem to go that extra bit further. I must say that tourists need to be careful of the name, because, though I warned them, some friends from Jerusalem, who had been told to book the Ayasofya Konaklari or Atasofya Pansiyonlari ONLY, instead booked the Ayasofya Hotel, a dreadful fleabag of a place, and not at all the same thing. On one detail, I must correct my dear friend Murat - from the top floor of the White House (Konuk Evi), the free-standing house in the same courtyard where one eats the delicious buffet breakfast (and don't forget to ask for a fresh omelet - they are wonderful, even if the waiters laugh when I slather it with ketchup!), one can see the waters of the Halic or Golden Horn. However, from there, one can't see any garbage-laden areas. The person who complained, must have stayed at the Ayasofya hotel, or another place with a similar name. The tramway, which is very convenient from the hotel, is a great way to get around. I go down the hill to the stop just below the exit from the Yerebetan Sarnic (Cistern), and when I return, I go to the next stop, Sultanahmet, so I don't have to walk back up the steep hill (or if I'm coming from the other direction, I simply get off at Sultanahmet stop, which is near the famous (or infamous) Puddingshop.). Incidentally, while not a five star hotel (and the prices definitely reflect that!), there is room service, and, in the cafe/library next to and up a few steps from the hotel office, there is a computer with internet, which guests may use. I check email there (just remember - in Turkish there are two \"i\"s, one with a dot on top (like in English, etc), one without. The regular one is to the right on the keyboard, while the one without, is located where the \"i\" is usually found. It is a bit confusing). They don't have TVs, but if you ask, they will put one in your room. I usually prefer without. Next door to Konuk Evi (sort of), is a wonderful handicraft centre in a genuine Madresse (school) by Mimar Sinan Pasha, called the Ceferiye Medrese (pronounced 'Jafari-yeh) with classes in Turkish arts (like Ebru, Marbling paper - I studied for a week with Ayla Makas - a brilliant lady , an amazing artist, and very patient (I'm ADHD and mild Asperger's, so she is REALLY patient!)), and it has a great little restaurant. There is another beautiful handicraft centre with superb things, next to Yesil Ev (Green House) hotel, another 'Turing' establishment, 5-10 min. walk away. Beautiful embroideries, calligraphy, miniatures, etc., at very reasonable prices, considering the objects are not churned out by the million. Both places, and also the gallery run by Coskun (pron. Joshkoon), have beautiful objects shown and sold by wonderful, friendly, truly hospitable people. Finally, a last word about the Sarnic (Cistern ) Restaurant in the hotel - it is amazing! the food is great but the atmosphere is even better - a Byzantine cistern with huge pillars and a fire place, with 30 or more foot ceiling. In summer, however, I prefer the courtyard near the fountain.

But I had to splurge for a couple of nights if only for the incredible close-up views of Aya Sofya. I wasn't disappointed. The staff were friendly and attentive at check-in and throughout my visit. These folks seemed to be looking for ways to enhance their guests' experience--it's nothing I can put my finger on, and I'm not very demanding anyway. But even I could tell that service standards were high. I never had a problem communicating in English. The breakfast is pleasant if typical, but the greenhouse where it's served is lovely and maybe even elegant. As mentioned in other reviews, the location is absolutely unbeatable, smack dab between Aya Sofya and the grounds of Topkapi Palace on a street that is closed to thru traffic at night. The recent refurbishment must have been a success because I saw no signs of shabiness. As a frequent solo traveller, I'm used to getting the smallest room in the hotel. And the room here was small too, but interestingly appointed with some Ottoman style furnishings. It didn't matter. The selling point here is the view, and it's a doozy: my grandmother could have hit Aya Sofya with a rock from my window. It's as close as you can get to sleeping *in* Aya Sofya. I can't tell you how many times I was drawn to that window, if only to look out and say to myself, \"I am the sultan,\" and very nearly believing it. So people who are prone to power trips probably shouldn't stay here. But everybody else should. Istanbul is one of my very favorite cities, and though there's a less expensive hotel I frequent, I will find a way to juggle the budget on future visits so I can stay here at least a night or two. It's that striking. By the way, complaining about the call to prayer in Istanbul is like complaining about how anoying all those church bells are in Rome.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cperfect setting for first istanbul sightseeing trip\u201d", "Author": "evanston_doc", "ReviewID": "UR29001122", "Content": "We spent 4 nts here where the apartments are attached to the Topkapi Palace. Despite adjacency to the Blue Mosque, the 5 am call to prayer is not at all unpleasant contrary to other posts. The tramline which hits all the major tourist sites is within a few hundred yards downhill - making the new district also quite reachable. They have wifi in the cafe, not sure if in the rooms, and have a single computer for public use. Staff are pleasant and polite, although beyond basic tourist english, can be more of a challenge for communication. The attached restaurants including the included breakfast (which does not change, but they will make you an omelet and espresso if you inquire) are in nice settings with the ayasofya and blue mosques looming in the backdrop. However, for price, the adjacent Hotel Ottoman Palace appears to have all the same advantages just no historical charm, and I suspect is better equipped inside. Check out the calligraphy madrassa in the alley adjacent for a delightful, simple place to catch lunch.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ayasofya Konaklari", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d295200-Reviews-Ayasofya_Konaklari-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$105 - $223*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Sogukcesme Street, Sultanahmet</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34122</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> (Formerly Ayasofya Pension)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "295200", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/db/8d/db8d97e27d63e5b8d988ec3c7d02f1cd5large.jpg"}}
