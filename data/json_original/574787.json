The hotel is at excellent location, on Goya near Velasquez and just the right size. Our room was very smartly furnished and comfortable.

This hotel had only been open a couple of months so I should have expected some teething problems. I am really not a fussy customer, but the whole feel of the place is unfinished; our room was clean and modern, but loo flush button was not fitted and no tea/coffee making facilities, and the lift stopped working one day and being on the 11th floor, it was quite a climb! But there was a back-up lift to the 8th floor.The cleaning lady did a poor job and although I always tip cleaning ladies, I didn't, as it really wasn't good (plus she didn't replace loo roll!)The hotel lobby is one of its worst features as it is very unimpressive for a 4star, and breakfast was okay but once they ran out of something, they wouldn't replace it so if you're later than about 9.30am for breakfast, you miss out on pastries. The waitress at breakfast was also very rude, and made an unecessary fuss in Spanish (thankfully I speak it!) because I took a packet of 4 biscuits from breakfast. I don't feel they did themselves any favours with service and didn't offer to help us with our suitcase.Location was quite good as you can walk to centre within 10 minutes and metro station is opposite if you don't want to walk.Overall, I would definitely not recommend this hotel, as I feel you can do so much better. It lacked charm and atmosphere but if you have already booked it however, then don't worry, it's not so terrible, but I wouldn't stay again.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR789915402", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ACoco"}, {"Content": "very nice hotel I stayed in this hotel by mistake - i was booked in another catalonia hotel but an error with the computer system meant i was whisked off to this one as compensation - I must say I was pleased they did! This hotel has only been open a few months. The room was spacious, clean, quiet and catered for my every need. The staff were friendly and gave helpfull advice to a novice in Madrid. They also speak very good English.
