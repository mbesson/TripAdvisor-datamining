For me, there was no ambiance as I personally prefer a quaint little B&B over this type of stay. He chose it, not me. However, if one is really into tennis, there could be an attraction here. We stayed here for 3 nights while visiting Venice. The breakfast buffet was excellent with many choices. The food in the restaurant was just ok, nothing to get excited about. We did enjoy traveling on the water bus back and forth. This hotel was very difficult to find and we spent a long time trying to figure how to get there. Fortunately we ran across another guest of the hotel who was able to direct us. We had to catch a local bus which took us reasonably close to the facility but we still had a pretty long walk from the bus stop. This is true for each time that one returns to the island. I might add that once we were settled in, the hotel has a shuttle which took us from the hotel to the town center and water bus stop. We still had to use the city bus for the return trip back to the hotel. The staff was very courteous and helpful. We chose to stay on Lido because we found it to be more economical than staying in Venice.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall, England", "Title": "\u201cGood base to explore Venice.\u201d", "Author": "MitzieHatch", "ReviewID": "UR119834084", "Content": "We found the hotel very good value for money, and it gave us a chance to spend longer in Venice than the usual weekend break.

We ate in the hotel restaurant several nights, as we were tired from our days exploring Venice, and thoroughly enjoyed our meals there. We found the staff helpful and friendly.

The location is not ideal however it is very easlily to get to with local transport this is however it is only redeeming feature. The staff here were terrible there were 2 helpful ladies on reception the most helpful staff at the hotel however every time i apporached the desk i felt like i was interupting them and considering the fact that the lobby was empty most of the time i felt it was a bit odd. The breakfast was pretty average but the coffee was terrible form the machines unless you figured out that you could get a decient cup from the coffee bar. The rooms we ok apart from the massive hole in the wall the no hot water in the shower and holes in the duvet covers and the fact that there are no tea and coffee making facilies any where to be found and you can't get hot water to you room either. However for me the best bit was after we asked what time the bar was closing and told 10.30 we were told to please leave at 10.10 in the evening as the bar was closed no last round just closed. However the men who work in the hotle get the prize for the rudest staff ever on the 3 ocassion i dealth with them the man who i assume must have been a manager was down right rude as well as the male receptionist and night porter . Truely astonishing. I truely am not some one who complains and i have worked in hotels for many years and i know how hard the job is. But there is a level of service and standard required and i really do feel that this was not done. So over all i would not recommend any one to stay here truely a total waste of money.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Warsaw, Poland", "Title": "\u201cA hotel with a swimming pool near Venice\u201d", "Author": "Pureflame", "ReviewID": "UR117016881", "Content": "The hotel itself is an average 3 star hotels.

They have a shuttle bus only in the morning and offers very limited seats, so don't count on it. Buy transport tickets for multi days for this hotel as it is very necessary. We had an issue with the housekeeping. They did not clean our room and told us that we put a do not disturb sign which we did not. The receptionist sent a doorman to our room and cleaned our room in 5 minutes. (???) Obviously he did not, he just place everything in the correct order. He even came without a trolley nor any cleaning agents. The room was still dirty. That was a big disappointment for us. If the hotel can simply apologize and send new towels and soap, that would be okay, but not this way. If you only stay for 2 or 3 days in Venice, I would not recommend this hotel.

The rooms were very basic, the staff had an \"I don't care/I don't want to do my job\" attitude and the beds were VERY uncomfortable. Every time we approached the staff about a problem, they made little or no effort to fix the problem. They even shrugged their shoulders and gave us the \"what do you want me to do about it\" look!!! Our first issue occurred upon check-in. I requested a \"cot (roll-away bed)\" in my 2 person room. At first they denied that I made the request. Then they found the request. Then they decided to make up a lie that went something like this \"Oh - a cot is a baby bed and we don't have a roll-away bed to give you\". We then asked for a 3 person room and they said they had none. My friend that was traveling with me reserved the second night - we asked them if that room was available. They said no. After about 30 minutes they finally \"found\" a 3 person room that we could stay in for the night. It was the very same room that my friend reserved for the next night! We went and grabbed some food and drinks that night and arrived back at the hotel around 1am. When we attempted to get in the front door, it was locked! We walked around the building and all of the doors were locked. No hotel key card entry at any of the doors. We had to pound on the door to get somebody to let us in. Apparently the front desk clerks sleep on the common area couches at night and the only method of entry is to pound on the door. Seriously??? Then we get to our room only to discover that we get to sleep on the world's most uncomfortable beds! All springs.... I swear I slept better on one of the trains on our trip! I told the front desk clerk in the morning that the beds were very uncomfortable. She shrugged her shoulders and gave me the \"what do you want me to do about it\" look. She didn't even apologize! This happened several times throughout our stay... Our 12\" TV didn't work in our room. We didn't really care so we never told the staff. The continental breakfast was decent. The facilities pool, gym, tennis courts, etc. were nice. Don't be fooled by the advertisements... the beach is not easily accessible from the hotel. They used to have access (long walk through the property and the adjacent property, but that access is gone. Now you have to walk a mile or so down the road. On the second night we returned late again.... We had to bang on the door for at least 15 minutes to wake the front desk clerk this time. This guy also had a horrible attitude. You could tell he was not happy about being woken up. Sorry buddy, it's your job!! The hotel has wireless internet that can be purchased in 30 minute increments. We asked to purchase some internet and this employee told us the internet was not working. My friend had purchased internet earlier and still had remaining credit. He logged on and was able to use the internet. More lies... We got up to our room only to discover that all of our key cards were not working... Back to the front desk. Back to a grumpy employee. He ran the key cards through the machine and we went back up to the room. They still didn't work. After several attempts and lots of grumbling from the clerk we were finally back in our room. I wanted to take a shower, but we couldn't find any towels in our bathroom. Back to the front desk. Back to a grumpy employee.... At first he wasn't even going to do anything to help me (again I got the \"what do you want me to do about it\" attitude)! After several cuss words and numerous grumbles, he stomped away to go get us some towels. Finally a shower and back in my bed for the worst nights sleep ever! I was bitten my mosquitoes all night long... In the morning we discovered why - the balcony door has a faulty latch and the door was left cracked open. This whole time we kept a positive attitude and were very nice to the staff even though our stay was less than enjoyable. I wish I could say the same about the staff at Ca' del Moro...

Location wise, it's about 10 minutes by bus from Santa Maria Elisabetta (water bus stop and centre of Lido) which can either be a plus (if you like to be away from the busier parts) or a minus (if you want to be able to walk to restaurants etc). Staff were all very efficient and friendly and the hotel is a fairly new build - white and very clean. Transport in Lido is absolutely fantastic - numerous buses came every 5 minutes or so and we never had to wait for a vaporetto (water bus). Also an excellent base for getting to Chioggia to the west and Lido di Jesolo to the east (for Aqualandia, not to be missed for kids) in less than 90 minutes. For an introduction to Italy that offers the Italian beach experience AND the culture and history of Venice, in a modern, very pleasant and well priced hotel, we couldn't have done better. I felt that Ca Del Moro was a sports facility for the local community first and a hotel second - not a problem for us. Most guests seemed to be overnighters on coach tours. The sports facilities (free gym, free outdoor pool and tennis courts - pricey at 11 euros per person per hour) are excellent but the swimming cap rule is annoying... Our recharge day by the pool (overlooked by some whacky apartment buildings designed to look, I think, like a football stadium?) was badly timed - that was the day the CDM hosted a football tournament for what seemed like a couple of hundred 8 year olds - all arriving at the poolside restaurant in batches for their lunch for a good couple of hours, and then running around the pool area. On all other occasions the pool was very quiet and beautifully peaceful, and the bar and bar food is very good and reasonably priced. Note that on Google earth and in some reviews it might seem that there's a beach in walking distance - there isn't. You'll need to get the V bus for about 10 minutes to get dropped off at the nearest beach which is very pleasant and offers pedalos, sailing, etc in season. Clean enough and nice non-sticky sand, and the best beach showers I've ever come across under a pine tree. As said, the CDM is out of the main resort and the sight of the builders' merchants across the road does give you a bit of a yuck reaction at first, but I never noticed it again after that first sighting!", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201ca very nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "maritth", "ReviewID": "UR47409342", "Content": "Nice and clean hotel, good breakfast included (ham, cheese, yoghurt etc.) Lovely and not crowded swimmingpool with sunbeds that were very nice.

We payed 216\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for a double room, all in advance. Location: The hotel is on the south part of the island Lido, near the \"city\" of Malamocco. The communications are very good, however. The vaporetto (water bus) goes very frequently 24 hours a day, with at most 20 minutes intervals between the departures (at night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much more frequently in the daytime). The lines you can take are 51 and 52 (the same circular route in opposite directions) and 1 (through the Canal Grande), and N at night. The duration of the trip obviously depends on where you take the vaporetto from, but from San Marco it takes around 10\u00e2\u20ac\u201c15 minutes. The vaporettos arrive north on Lido, at Santa Maria Elisabetta. The hotel is about 4.5 km away. The buses from the vaporetto-stop are also very frequent, and go 24 hours a day, with 10 minutes intervals at daytime, and 20 and 30 minutes intervals at the late evening and night time respectively. The bus ride takes 10-15 minutes. The buses A and B takes the straightest route, and V takes a small detour, but also drives past the hotel. N is the night bus line. In the morning the hotel has a shuttle bus service that goes from the hotel parking to the vaporetto stop at 20 minutes intervals between 8.30 and 10.30. The bus stop you need to go off at when going to the hotel has the name Via Malomocco 4/5 (which means it is the fourth stop on the road Via Malamocco in that direction). Then you see the hotel a little further down the road on the left. Room: The room was spacious and clean, and had a very high condition. There was a small balcony and a big double bed (but with two separate mattrasses). The bathroom was nice and clean, and with a good sized shower. There was a ventilation system, but we didn't quite get the automatic temperature regulation to work. We didn't need it though, as the room had a cool temperature even though it was quite hot. There was a TV in the room, and you could buy SKY TV access. Internet: There was a wireless connection in the hotel lobby, but you had to pay, 2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for 15 minutes, 3\u00e2\u201a\u00ac for half an hour and so on. Bar/Restaurant: There was a bar/restaurant at the poolside, where they had a small selection of meals. Breakfast was served in the hotel lobby/reception building between 7.30 and 9.30 and was included. The breakfast was really good, with rolls, cheese, ham, salami, yam, yoghurt, cereals, several juices and a small coffee-bar. They also had croissants with orange filling, and a diverse selection of plastic wrapped cookies. The buffet was large and clean, and the service was very good. Sports: The hotel is co-located with a tennis-facilty, with around 8 fields, both outdoor and indoor. The training room was also very large and well equipped. The sports facilities is not just for the hotel, but also have other clients, so it is much bigger than your normal hotel exercise rooms. There was a sauna, but it wasn't heated all the time, you had to book it around 40 minutes prior to use to let it heat up. The outdoor pool was open in the summer season, and was a OK pool. Not too much chlorine in it, but it looked OK clean, but not perfect. Service: The hotel staff spoke well English, and delivered a very efficient and good service. Price: We checked several hotel booking sites and found one that gave a significant lower price than the others, which is something other reviewers also have reported, so check around before you book. We booked through a Norwegian site called Expedia.no, and others have found low prices on RatesToGo.com. Conclusion: We liked very much our stay at Ca' del Moro. It takes between 30 minutes and an hour to get in to the city, so you can't go back and forth much during the day. We didn't feel the location as a problem, though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite on the other hand we found the boat ride to Lido to be a good start/end of the day, and it was nice to live a bit out of the hazzle and crampedness of Venice city.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Ca' del Moro Foresteria", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d671039-Reviews-Ca_del_Moro_Foresteria-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$86 - $185*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Malamocco 83, Lido</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30126</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "671039", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/55/b2/outdoor-swimmingpool.jpg"}}
