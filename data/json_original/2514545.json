But after you get over it, it is quite cozy. The rooms are a bit small but you are in London and for less then 200 you get ...well not much. But this Bed and breakfast is pleasant and the staff is very professional and charming. Simon the owner did everything he could to retain me, he walked my suitcase to the 5th floor and allowed me to cancel if I wished. Very English I guess. That's what this country has going for themselves they seem to still care about old fashion values of being proper and fair, we like it business like and expeditious. Breakfast was very nice served by a Mongolian lady and Filipino. Don't expect a large bathroom but one of those bathrooms all contained in the same shell a sort bathroom you would get on a boat. Not much bigger. The hotel is clean and everything else in the room as well. I wish they could have a larger TV. This one is like the one we had in the kitchen. But who cares about TV when you are in London... Oddly enough I would recommend this hotel. Make sure you ask for a room downstairs if you have any health issues. The last 2 flights are in a sort of spiral , hard to get to your room if you are overweight or ill.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Bnana", "ReviewID": "UR121272678", "Content": "I've tried 12 to 14 hotels in the area around Paddington station.

Bathroom is small - that's what they are for hotels in the area & we got clean towels every day. & it was super clean - like the room. The hotel has soundproof could only hear the other guests when they went out & out of their doors. Breakfast was standard for the area - however, there were 6 different Flakes - muesli - etc you could just choose from even beyond the English Breakfast.

I found this hotel on Trip Advisor and took a chance. A Marriott it is not, but the price/ value was fantastic! I would highly recommend this hotel if you are on a budget. The room was clean with en suite facilities. There was free hot cooked breakfast everyday (included in room prices) and the front reception is open 24 hours. I forgot to pack an electrical adapter, but the hotel offered one to lend. Now you must remember that the rooms are small and there is no lift. I was on the 4th floor, which was a bit of a climb, but good exercise. The bathroom was very small, but it is private. The plusses where its location, within a block or so of Paddington station, price, cleanliness, and in a quiet area that allows for a good night\u2019s sleep. For those that did not rate this hotel highly, it must be because their expectations were too high. To give a negative score because of the small room sizes is misleading, since that is what you are paying for. I had no problem with WIFI or the TV, (but had to figure out that you had to turn the power button on then select a channel number before it turned on) and there were plenty of channel selections.

I write his review bearing in mind the cost and quality of other hotels in London. Sussex Gardens is located about a 5-minute walk from Paddington Station and is easy to find. The guy at reception was very friendly and dealt with check-in smoothly. Note you have to pay the bill upon check-in. I was on a high floor and there is no lift, which is common in these period buildings. Note that the stairs are narrow and steep. Again this is common with buildings of this type. I had a single room and it was tiny. Apart from the single bed there was not much space for anything else except for a small desk, with a 14 inch TV with freeview channes, a tiny slot in shower/toilet/sink cubicle and a small wardrobe. The room however was clean and quiet. The bed, in which I slept vey well, was comfy, and sheets replaced every day. The ensuite cubicle really is tiny but at least the room has one. In London, for this price, showers and toilets are normally shared. The shower is so small about a third of my body protruded out past the shower curtain, and I am not fat! The toilet is almost adjacent to the shower as is the sink. However, though the water pressure is a little low, it all worked and there is constant hot water. There is one (1) small towel and you get two tiny bars of soap and a tumbler. The tumbler was dirty with toothpaste on the bottom. The TV though small had most Freeview channels which was good. There was a rather large fly and wasp that I killed in the room but only because the window was wide open when I got into the room. Breakfast is quite nice. Again, much better than the usual fare one would get in hotels in this category. In the basement there's a cosy and decent sized dining room with an adjacent kitchen with a couple of friendly and welcoming female cooks. You can help youself to cereas, juices and fresh coffee. Plus a whole rack of toast each and an Ebglish breakfast (which comprised two fried eggs, two bacon, about 20 beans and a tinned tomato). It was filling, tasted good and was served up by the ladies with a smile. Check-out is simply a case of leaving your key card on reception. No fuss whatsoever (there are no mini-bars, restaurants etc at this type of hotel). From Paddington Station you can easily get into the West End (Bakerloo Line) or other places in London. Hyde Park is not far away at all. In summary, though the rooms are small and basic, everything works, the place is clean, comfortable and the service is friendly. For that reason I recommend this place for those on a budget.", "Date": "October 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cOmega Hotel - good value accommodation\u201d", "Author": "Flyingisfun", "ReviewID": "UR17910995", "Content": "This is a small hotel in a good location - close to Paddington station and short walk to city centre.

This hotel served that function very well. We slept comfortably and had a fully-functioning shower. Luckily, we are not picky hotel guests, otherwise we would've been quite dissatisfied with the overall value for money spent. For example, we (like previous reviewers) received only one towel, and the glasses in the bathroom were disgustingly dirty. They were not replaced during our visit.

It was difficult to wash your face in the sink, because of the glass ledge over the sink.

I told the owner and he said \" I guess I'll have to fumigate it when you leave.\" We would have found a different hotel, but I had unfortuately paid up front.
