It was clean, good location for the Sea World parks and that's about it. It offers standard size rooms with microwave and mini frige, which is nice. They do offer complimentary shuttle services to the parks and quick queue passes for Sea World, that's where the extras end. We were lucky to be on a floor that was totally non-smoking, however, they do have other floors that were half smoking half not. (for my family that's not cool, all we lucked out) They have one standard size pool, again nothing special. Though the hotel has a mini store in the lobby for those forgotten items or late night snacks... Don't bother! You're better of running to the CVS just down the road, because those prices were insane! The walls are very thin, no privacy here!

He asked if there was anything that he could help with, before we arrived. I asked if he couldn\u2019t block our favorite room, and hinted that we might arrive at the hotel a little early. Within a few minutes I got a short and sweet email in reply. \u201cYour requested room has been blocked. We look forward to seeing you, Sir!\u201d The next morning my wife and I arrived a few minutes after 10:00 A.M. (We know that regular check-in time is normally 3:00 P.M). Anyway, it just so happened that the young man at the front desk was Brian; who welcomed us with a handshake and a smile. Your room is ready, Mr. Kaye, but we are changing the shower head; so it will be just a few minutes before I can give you the key cards. What I expected, was the normal\u2026.. come back after 3:00 PM, or maybe try 4:00 PM (just to be sure), but that wasn\u2019t the case then. In a few minutes we were on our way to our favorite room (5 to 6 hours ahead of check in time). While we were waiting (for the key cards); Patricia (Associate of the year); had finished up with another guest. She recognized me by face, and come over to the side of the check in counter. After a hand shake, she reached over and gave me a big hug, along and a friendly \u201cWelcome Back\u201d. I turned around to see Gary, (Food and Beverage Manager); giving my wife a big hug. I thought to myself, \u201cThis is more like a family reunion; then a hotel check in\u201d. Minutes later, we were in our favorite room. My wife started unpacking bags, while I took the baggage cart back to the front lobby of the hotel. On my way back up to our top floor room, the elevator doors opened on the second floor. A young man, pushed a vacuum cleaner into the elevator, than pushed a floor button. Then he pushed a higher floor number. He then turned to me and said\u2026.\u201dExcuse me Sir, but I pushed the wrong button\u201d. As we both watched the doors open and close, he said\u2026\u201dI sure want to apologize for slowing you down today.\u201d Then as he exited on the right floor, he said\u2026.\u201dHave a nice day, Sir\u201d. As I walked down the hall to be with my wife, I couldn\u2019t help thinking about that fine, courteous young man, who we had never seen or met before. This young man had no idea that my wife and I had stayed in this hotel (last year), for a total of 55 nights. Nor did he have any idea that this trip, we were planning to stay for 11 nights. Yes, this fine young man (who I still don\u2019t know by name); took time from his job as \u201cYoung Man in charge of Vacuuming the Halls\u201d; to (for a minute) become \u201cDirector of Public Relations\u201d for the entire Hilton Garden Inn chain. Is there any wonder that last year, I gave this hotel a sparkling, shining, positive response on TripAdvisor? And is there any question as to why my wife and I always stay at this hotel, when we are visiting Orlando? Good Value, and Great Service. All the best and \u201cThank You\u201d again, to the Hilton Garden Inn-SeaWorld, team.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC", "Title": "\u201cHidden GEM\u201d", "Author": "Red_Dolphin-Media", "ReviewID": "UR126431107", "Content": "I have heard other reviewers say this but some of Hilton's best properties are NOT the on the highest end of their price scale..in fact I have come to love Hilton Garden Inn more than most full-service Hiltons! I moved to this hotel after staying at the Hilton Downtown Disney for one evening...originally had been moved to a nearby Hampton Inn that didn't work out so well. They welcomed me here for 4 nights and I was extremely impressed. From the moment I checked in with Brian, things were terrific. The room was large, with extremely comfortable beds, flat screen tv, fridge, microwave, and GREAT desk. Very strong wifi, and great AC. I am a Hilton Honrs Gold member so they included the breakfast buffet for me each day which was awesome. Heated pool and jacuzzi were excellent, and the hotel has on-site laundry, a 24 hour convenience area off the front desk with snacks and sundries, and a 24 hour CVS and 7-Eleven across the street. It is also within true walking distance to the Sea World entrance, even though it has free shuttles running. Parking at the hotel was free and I had no problems getting a spot. Lobby is nice with a great bar, and they have the nightly tradition of cookies at the front desk which was great! They also use some Neutrogena soap products in the room which were great! Note: the one thing I had to work around was the lack of safe in the room (I carry multiple computers), but the front desk had HUGE safe deposit boxes available and I stored my computers there when away and it worked out really well. I will definitely be back here...the value and the service offering are among the best I have found here. Disney's Magic Kingdom took me about 15 mins to drive to on I-4...but i was so easy with I-4 right outside the hotel (no lights once on I-4).

It's not a luxury resort, but it's perfectly suited for any length of stay. It was lacking in a couple of things, but it made up for it in every other way. The place was easy to find once we picked up our rental car from the airport. Rooms were clean and spacious. Odd numbered rooms face SeaWorld. Supposedly SeaWorld fireworks, but I never saw/heard any. Here's the good: 1.) Air conditioners worked awesome. Some people said they were too loud, but they're the same as every other in-room AC I've ever used. If the sound of it kicking on bothers you, just leave the fan on. That way it's less noticeable. 2.) Free WiFi. 3.) Breakfast was huge. Our corporate rate provided it for us, but even the cash price was fair. 4.) Access to I-Drive and Convention Centre. If you have a car, there is a multitude of restaurants within a 10 min drive. Downtown Disney, and the outlet mall is also <10 min drive. Universal is a bit further, but still easy to get to. Couple minor things... 1.) The fridges in the room worked well. A little too well. Stuff would routinely freeze in them. It wasn't just mine, all the other people in my group reported a similar problem. 2.) Gym is small. Granted most people at hotels in Orlando get plenty of exercise at the amusements, those on business don't. Would have been nice if it was slightly larger with more free weights or weight machines. 3.) No usable stairs. I had the intent of using the stairs at the hotel instead of the elevator, but unfortunately you have no access to them from the main floor unless you go through the ballrooms. So they suited their purpose as a fire escape, but that's it. 4.) Beds were firmish. Fitted sheet kept sliding off and the comforter was sort of lumpy. I still slept ok, and they did have an assortment of pillows. 5.) Bathrooms are small, and not very well laid out. Staff at the hotel was able to resolve every issue I had. The bar opens up at 5 pm. Drinks are pretty pricey, but the CVS Pharmacy across the street had everything you needed. And a 7-11 just opened up beside it. The both sell beer and everything else. SeaWorld is super close. Pedestrian entrance is less than a block away. No idea why anyone would take the bus there. There isn't much else within a reasonable walk. Everything was a 20 min walk minimum if you had no car. I would have no hesitation about going back, but the hotel is more set up for business travelers with a vehicle as opposed to families on vacation. I will most likely be back on business again. I gave the location 3 stars only because it's not within a short walking distance to much. The area is still slowly developing. If you want to take a jog or anything it takes about 30 mins to go all the way around SeaWorld.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worthington, ohio", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again and recommend to family and friends\u201d", "Author": "Shari1523", "ReviewID": "UR125678587", "Content": "My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Disney for my birthday.

I stayed at the HGI from Labor Day weekend 2011 for 10 days to visit Orlando and the parks. The hotel offers ample free parking to the sides and rear and there was no issues of finding a space in September. The rooms offered a large flat screen TV, a fridge, microwave and a coffee making machine. The only thing that is missing and to some travellers which is quite important is an in-room safe. Apparently you can also leave your valueables in the hotel safe at reception but that is very inconvenient. There is complimentary in-room wifi and wired internet connection. The front desk was pleasant at check-in. My room had a constant running water problem with the toilet but maintenance sorted the problem out in no time. I had a buffet breakfast daily which consisted of your usual eggs, sausages, cereals etc. The restaurant staff soon got used to my face on a daily basis and all very pleasant with tea, coffee and juice. There is also a self serve area set up in the bar with tea, coffee and hot chocolate in the morning. On the ground floor there is a small gym and outside is the pool area. The hotel location is excellent with SeaWorld directly opposite. I left the car in the hotel car park and walked across to SeaWorld which took about 10mins through the SeaWorld car park and saving $14 in parking charges. The trolley/bus stop is immediately outside the hotel. Driving to Disney takes approximately 15mins travelling straight onto the I4. Orlando International Airport is 15mins from the hotel this time straight onto the 528. If you have a room facing SeaWorld, you can sometimes see the firework display too. There is an Expedia travel desk in the lobby, if you are planning to visit SeaWorld then go to the travel desk early in the morning on the day of your visit and ask for a quick queue voucher. This is complimentary to all quests staying at the hotel. Overall this is a lovely clean well priced hotel to stay in Orlando. If you have access to a car then the hotel is well located to all attractions. The negatives I have are no in-room safe, air conditioner a bit noisy and the mattress topping which I am not a big fan of.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cThe place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "Mlundin13", "ReviewID": "UR124738003", "Content": "Great service.

The room spacious and very clean with the room overlooking SeaWorld at the back of the hotel, which was great to view the Seaworld firework display on New Years Eve. This hotel has a great atmosphere the Hilton associates are always only to pleased to satisfy no matter what is being asked of them. In the morning you can get free coffee in the bar which I used daily while I waited for the family for breakfast while watching the news on the TV and using my laptop to use the free internet connection yes it is still FREE. The restaurant/bar serves excellent food and would highly recommend eating in the resturant The food is EXCELLENT. Seaworld is a five minute walk away or use the hotel shuttle service which also goes to the other main parks, Nothing has changed Great Hotel, Great Loaction and Fantastic Associates. If you can find a better hotel not just for money but service level I suggest you book it, but I don't think you will. If you consider the whole package, Hilton Associates, service level, food, and location I do not beleive you will beat it.

Having a car available, a central location was not a prime concern, so the Garden Inn looked a perfect choice. Although not exactly in the hub of International Drive, the major interstates are close by giving access to all the Orlando and Kissimee theme parks as well as Kennedy and Busch Gardens in Tampa. First impressions are that the hotel is out of the way. From the I580, you have to drive about a mile down Westwood Boulevard which is mostly offices and hotels . You won't find any of the bars and restaurants close by that you would expect staying further up International Drive. The hotel is next to the Radisson, which is a lot easier to spot when driving, especially in the dark. Easiest access is off Academic Drive between the Radisson and Graden Inn. The exterior is tidy, well kept and the hotel has a large free car park, something that not every hotel in Orlando has. For those without transport, shuttles are available to and from the airport and all of the major theme parks. A regular trolley service operates to and from the more heavily populated parts of International Drive if you want to go out for the evening. Before arriving, I had done my homework and found that the better rooms are at the rear of the hotel, which overlook Seaworld. These are the odd numbered rooms. I had phoned reservations the day before and asked for, if possible, a room on that side on floors 7 or 8 (the tops floors). On arrival, I was allocated an even number room on floor 4, but on querying the allocation, the reception was happy to reallocate me to room 709, a king non smoking room. The rooms are well laid out, spacious and light, with good quality fixtures and fittings. The bed was extremely comfortable, and offers the ability to vary the softness/firmness of the matress to suit your own tastes. There is a control for either side of the bed so a couple doesn't have to compromise. Every room is provided with a refridgerator and microwave, very useful if, like me, you prefer drinking tea to coffee. Coffee making facilities are provided in the room, but not tea making, The ability to boil water in the microwave for tea more than makes up for it though. The bathroom fittings are of the same high standard as those in the bedroom. Water pressure was excellent, dispite being near the top of the building, and there was always plenty of hot water on demand. A small range of toiletries were topped up each day as requried. For rest and relaxation in the room, wi-fi is provided free of charge throughout the hotel. TV sports about 30 channels, including the majority of the favourite free to air entertainment and sports channels. Air conditioning is controlled via a thermostat on the wall, so you can set the temperature of the room in the morning and leave it for when your return at night. For dinings, the hotel offers a bar area which serves food and drink until 2300 at night. The menu is the same as the restaurant, which is open until 2200 at night for those heer prefer to dine more formally. Room service can be ordered until 2300 from the restaurant menu, a 20% surcharge replacing the normal fixed service charge. Breakfast is not normally included in the room rate, but is available every morning from 6.30 offering a range of hot and cold buffet food, omelettes cooked to order as well as savories for the sweet toothed ones. There is a set cost of $12.50. Other facilities provided by the hotel include a small gym/workout area, heating outdoor swimming pool and hot tub, a 24 hour store for small grocery items/personal items/soap etc and and two launderies (great if like me you travel light). The main selling pont of the hotel is it's proximity and links to Seaworld. The theme park entrance is between a 15 and 20 minute walk from the hotel. Just walk down Academic Drive at the side of the hotel, cross Sea Harbor Drive and walk diagonally across the car park to your left to get to the main gate. As well as selling entrance tickets, hotel residents are entitled to \"front of queue\" priority passes, essential if you want to ride the coasters. Useful to remember is that combination tickets are available for Seaworld, Aquatica and Busch Gardens, and all tickets are valid for unlimited access to the parks for 14 days from your first visit. I you do have a room overlooking Seaworld, don't miss the fireworks display just before closing each night. Also on the recommended list for first time visitors to Orlando is a trip out to Kennedy Space Centre on Merritt Island. About a 50 minute drive from Orlando, it provides a comprehensive look at the American Space Program, past, present and future. Their new tour, Kennedy Up Close is highly recommended, since for the first time it allows visitor inside the huge vehicle assembly buildings where the massive Apollo rockets, and laterly, the space shuttle were assembled. The shuttle orbiter Endeavour is being stored in there at present, and visitor can get within 10 yards of it for photographs.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.

The room has a great LCD TV and the microwave and Refridgerator are useful. The bed is comfortable and the noise level is perfect. The internet is up to Hilton standards and the GM, front desk folks, bartender, and very pretty slender dark haired server is very nice as well as all the restaurant folks. The food was very nice and had a great selection to choose from. The only complaint I have is the phone has some static and one needed a little adjusting to make it work. Not a big deal. The pool is very nice and has a very nice feel to it with the bar steps away. Now if you want noisy lobbies, lots of activity with tourists, difficult parking, and lots of traffic to deal with than there are lot's of those hotels to choose from.

The Good: The hotel was easy to find and easy to get to and from. Check in and check out went very smoothly. The hotel had everything in order and checked us in and out very quickly. The front desk staff was very friendly and very helpful with any questions we asked. We ordered room service late one night and were told it would take 25 minutes. The food arrived in about fifteen minutes which was a nice surprise. The bed was very comfortable and I got a good nights sleep each night. The Bad: The room was not very impressive. One part of the wall had been obviously repainted and the color didn't even come close to matching the original color. The shower head in the shower was about chest high making washing of hair difficult. The shower floor was very high (I think for plumbing underneath) however this left little room to have a reasonably high shower head. The Ugly: The housekeeping service was obviously done by someone who didn't really care about their job. One day the trash was not emptied in the bathroom. Another day the trash was emptied in the room however the bag was not replaced leaving a trash can that was rusty and nasty inside. We had set 3 cans and bottles by the trash can and only two were taken away. The trash can at one point was left near the center of the room (obiously not returned to its location after being emptied). We did leave a $2-$3 tip each day and got this type of service (I understand $3 is not a lot of money however expected better service even without a tip). The bathroom shower was very dirty looking. I don't think it was actually dirty just old and worn down. The comforter on the bed looked like it had been used for 10 years. Instead of having an even thickness the filling was clumped up in many different places. The sheets came off one corner of the bed one day to reveal a very nasty looking stain on the side of the mattress. It looked like someone had been murdered against the side of the bed. Overall I would not recommend this hotel due to the fact that there are about a million hotels in the Orlando area. The price was reasonable however I think compared to others in the area better deals can easily be found. Maybe I just got a bad room but I wouldn't come back. I did not bring these issues to management so I am not sure how they would have responded.

Especially at a resort that you're already paying top-dollar for. Internet was also free at the HIlton. All in all, a very comfortable stay. If you're coming to the Orlando parks, it was a great deal compared to most of the other places in the area and literally across the street from SeaWorld.

Location is a wierd one for anywhere on international drive as it is so long, we had no idea it was such a distance from one end to the other. The hotel itself is great for sea world and discovery cove, easily walking distance for sea world, discovery cove is about 5 minutes drive at most from sea world. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel where you can get the bus that goes all the way along i-drive, the bus service was quite poor and it would cost far too much to get taxis everywhere, alot of times we waited more than 20 minutes for a bus only to see one go past with the FULL sign on-THIS OBVIOUSLY CANT BE COUNTED AGAINST THE HOTEL, just that it relates to the location thing, although renting a car would cancel this out. As most people will be going to discovery cove/sea world/busch gardens/disney world, the location is fantastic. At night we mostly got the i-ride bus down a few stops to a busy area with restaurants, bars, then taxi back which after tip was generally less than $15.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, WV", "Title": "\u201cAmazing\u201d", "Author": "Todd B", "ReviewID": "UR119548323", "Content": "We stayed for four days for a conference.

My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. All the employees who worked the front desk during our stay were wonderful and extremely helpful. They answered all our questions and were friendly no matter the time of day. There is also an Expedia local expert stationed at a desk by the front entrance and all the experts that we encountered were very friendly and knowledgable as well. The hotel was very clean, well kept, and has eight floors. We were given a room on the eighth floor facing the front of the hotel. The room was large and roomy. There was a king bed with two night stands, an alarm clock, a sitting chair with small coffee table, a writing desk with a nice ergonomic chair, a large flat screen TV atop a dresser, a fridge and a microwave. The bathroom was roomy as well and was very clean. There is a nice sized closet with an iron and ironing board. The room was very quiet. There are no safes in the rooms. Instead, there are safes by the front desk. They give you a key in order to lock up your valuables. Yours is the only key that opens the lock. So I would say, don't worry about security as I used the safe and everything was fine and this is coming from someone who was very hesitant to leave my stuff by the front desk. We didn't use the pool or gym so I can't comment on those areas. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night and had the pizza special - $19.95 for a large pizza, 2 liter coke product and buffalo wings. A great deal. The service at the restaurant was excellent. The waitress was accommodating and friendly. The employees we encountered at this hotel really were just great. You couldn't ask for better staff. The only problem we ever had was with someone we never encountered - the housekeeping staff that cleaned our room. We came back to the room one night to find that our trash can had not been emptied of trash which was disconcerting seeing as how we had left a tip on the bed for housekeeping. We also didn't receive a newspaper during our stay except for our first and last day, meanwhile we saw other rooms received a paper daily. Other than housekeeping, we thought the hotel staff was great. Every morning by the front desk, they have complimentary coffee and tea for guests and at night by the front desk they put out free cookies for guests. The hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to Universal Studios, Disney World, and SeaWorld. There are specific times when you can catch these shuttles. The hotel's Disney shuttle drops you off at Epcot and from there you can hop onto an official Disney shuttle to get to the other Disney theme parks. You have to then return to Epcot to get picked up for the return to the hotel. It might sound difficult but it was fine and pretty convenient. The hotel shuttles to Universal and SeaWorld were great - convenient pick up and return times and large comfortable shuttles. The hotel shuttle to Disney though was a different story. The hotel's Disney shuttle is a shuttle run by a company called Crown City. It picks people up from other hotels before it arrives at the Hilton Garden Inn and is a much smaller shuttle. Once it arrives at the Hilton, it's already packed and is standing room only. If you're lucky enough to get a seat, you may find yourself wondering who built the shuttle. Apparently whoever built it didn't think people would need leg room because from the back of one seat to the seat behind it, there is about 1 inch of leg room and sadly that is not an exaggeration. From the Hilton it traveled to two other hotels before it finally arrived at Disney. The week we stayed at the hotel, the return times to the hotel were 6:40pm and 10:00pm. Who decided on these return times?! Magic Kingdom closed at 7:00pm and Epcot closed at 9:00pm while we were there. A 6:40pm pick up time cheats you out of time at both parks and the 10:00pm pick up time left you standing in a parking lot for an hour after the park closed waiting for a shuttle. The 10:00 shuttle was always packed and it was always standing room only. The driver always arrived past 10:00 and there was always a lone woman sitting in the front. Who was this mysterious woman and where did the driver pick her up from? Hmm could it be that she was the reason he was always late? She took up a seat that could have gone to a hotel guest. Apparently the week prior, there was a 9:20pm return time ... wish they would have kept that time for the week we were there. There is a CVS located across the street from the hotel which was very convenient. You can pick up water, snacks, and anything else you might have forgotten. We bought rain ponchos from there when we heard it was going to rain one day. The ponchos really saved us when it started to pour at Universal. The CVS is open 24 hours. If you're going to order in, we ordered from Flipper's Pizza and it was pretty good. Their prices are reasonable and delivery was fast. The toppings were very fresh and the pizza was good. Once they arrive at the hotel, the front desk gives you a call and you go down to the lobby to pick up the pizza. So, all in all a good hotel with great staff. If housekeeping and the Disney shuttle were better, then the hotel would've been excellent.

I am not even sure if the hotel accounted for every guest's whereabouts during the evacuation, and the staff left BEFORE the guests! This is what a decent hotel (staff) would do: - Inform guests about the evacuation before leaving the hotel first (and refusing to answer the lobby phone) - Gather guests in the lobby of the other hotel and let us know what's going on - this is common sense! - REASSURE US - Tell us the plan of action and promise to update us. This hotel did NONE of the above. They left everyone to their own devices, they did not take care of their guests at all. We didn't even know when we could return to our rooms!

Christy was also great in the restaurant and bar in the evenings - nothing was too much trouble. Special mention to Mike and Gary for looking after us so well on our wedding anniversary -. Coming back to our room in the evening after a long, hot day at the parks to find a bottle of bubbly on ice and some cold beers waiting was an unexpected delight and truly appreciated. I think it is a testament to the way the hotel is run that so many of the team have worked there so long. There is a real family atmosphere amongst the staff and they really do go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as they can.

Having stayed in hundreds (if not thousands) of hotels during our business years, and now in our leisure years; we know goodness when we see and experience it. A few years ago, we visited HGI Seaworld for a few days, then moved on to other Florida cities. Last year, we visited this property, stayed a month, but had prior commitments, so we moved on to Miami and Key West to enjoy other Hilton properties. This year, we decided to visit HGI Seaworld, over the year end holidays, with plans to move on to other Hilton properties though out Florida in January and February. Once the holidays were over, my wife and I realized that there were still interesting things to do at Millienium Mall, Florida Mall, and the two Premium Outlets; so we decided to extend our stay for a few more weeks. (The hotel is located between many nice shopping areas, and down the road from Disney attractions). After enjoying our shopping, we learned about Islewood, Bay Hill and the interesting lake properties around Orlando suburbs. So we spent many days looking at what real estate opportunities may be available in the area. Each morning we enjoyed our cooked breakfast, and after a few days, Gary (the restaurant manager) came to our table and let us know that it was nice to have us as his guests, and that his staff, Pilar, William, Guillerimo, Jose, Christina and others felt like we were part of the family. Each morning they greeted us with a smile and ushered us to a table that they kept especially for us. Then one morning it was obvious that with a full hotel, the breakfast staff was stressed because of a large convention, at the Convention Center on International Drive. That morning a tall handsome gentleman came over to our table and helped clean some of the plates, but took time to greet us and let us know that he had seen us, but we hadn't had a chance to chat. It happened that the gentleman was Mike, (the hotel's general manager) who was helping to serve the customers (one busy morning). His willingness to pitch in and serve the guests impressed us to no end. It was obviously his lead, that was what was behind \"The Good Spirit of Warm Friendly Service\" at the hotel. To make a long story short, we enjoyed getting to know Mike and his wonderful staff. Each time we passed the front desk, Patricia, Chris, Annie, Steven (and all the others managed to give us a smile, and say \"Good Morning\" or \"Good Afternoon\". In fact, after a hard day of shopping, it was nice to hear one of Mike's staff say...\"Welcome Home\" On our final night; as I looked out the 7th floor window and was enjoying \"The Seaworld fireworks\" for the 52nd time this stay; I felt my wife's hand on my shoulder. I looked over at her, and saw that she had a tear in her eye. I said honey, what's wrong? She said:\"I hate to leave home tomorrow\". We decided not to buy a home, or condo in Florida. We'll just plan to return next year to our home away from home. Thanks, Mike, Gary and your entire staff for helping to end our 2010 with joy, and to kick off our 2011 with \"Fantastic Memories\".", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kitchener, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDecent place to spend a couple of nights\u201d", "Author": "MamaJojo123", "ReviewID": "UR95009199", "Content": "Booked this hotel on Priceline and got a good deal.

We loved this place. (We had a view of Sea World, could walk to and from Sea World, comfortable beds, outstainding customer service, reasonably priced tastey food, a great little pool area with a very warm pool (which my son and I love and look for) plus a hot tub). We booked the Sea World package that for an extra $20 a night offered two Sea World tickets (nice deal). We ordered room service twice: Kid meals my son ordered (pasta one night) (peanut butter and jelly the other) came with yummy fries and apple juice (actually drink of choice and this is what he picked) and were both under $5. The one night that I ordered room service too, I got a delicous salad and a tasty BBQ chicken sandwich. The salad was about $4 and the sandwich which included fries about $7. My only disappointment with food was the cost of breakfast $12 for the buffet or $8 for a continental breakfast. If you aren't getting the Sea World package, you might want a package that includes breakfast with your room. Rather than pay this, we ate snacks that we brought along or purchased in the little store by the front desk and left overs in our refrigerator for breakfasts. Next time, I'll bring a soft sided cooler with some breakfast items. Rooms have mini frig and a microwave. I liked this place so much that one day after being back, I booked another mini three day trip for March. Things to note: Bed are doubles rather than queens // Our air conditioning didn't work initially. This was fixed as soon as we made a call, but keep this in mind and call right away if you book here and find yourself in a room that isn't cooling off right away when you turn down the thermostat. Side Note on other ratings of the property: I was very surprised to see that the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World only gave this property a 65 for a quality rating. I've stayed at six other Orlando properties listed in this guide that were ratings between 93 and 75 which I thought that the guide had rated appropriately. The low rating for this place just didn't make any sense to me, and usually I think the unofficial guide is right on. // Tip regarding Sea World -- walking over is great. After a busy day at the park, though, walking back isn't as appealing.

We got a great deal with Travel Republic in the UK with full buffet breakfast included in the cost. We've previously stayed at the Peabody and Renaissance at Seaworld, and I have to say the customer service and care at the HGI was every bit as good - if not better as those two higher class hotels. The HGI is located just across the road from Seaworld's car park and is a brisk 15 minute walk to their front gate. Overall we had a great stay. The beds are very comfy, the rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day, breakfast staff and all front desk staff were very polite and helpful. The pool looks fine but we didn't use it, nor did we use the exercise room, but it always looked very quiet. Just off the reception is a \"pantry\" which stocks a range of sweets and drinks and pre-packed food for use in the in-room microwave. And because you use reception to pay for anything, it's open 24hrs a day. And adjacent to that is the \"business centre\". Two PC's for surfing and checking emails and one dedicated \"airline check in terminal\". All rooms and communal area's had Wi Fi as well, so constant surfing the whole time on my laptop. The biggest problem we had was with the room air conditioner. I can't understand why ALL reviews on here don't mention this. The air con machines for all the rooms in this hotel are actually located IN THE ROOM, sitting just under the window. As such, when the fan kicks in you get the full volume of the fan blowing then when the cooling compressor kicks in you get the rattle and humm from this too. Either one would be bad enough, but when the two are running at full pelt, the noise is unbearable. The first couple of days we resorted to cooling the room to freezing point in the day then pulling the plug out the wall when we went to bed. Got fed up of this tack eventually so complained to the front desk and they admitted the air con machines were noisey and were all due to be replaced. New ones had just arrived in fact.... so, ours was replaced for a nice shiny new one that day. First class service. But! The only difference was that the fan control had a \"half speed\" setting on it, so it was a wee bit quieter. At least we were able to cool the room and sleep, so the holiday wasn't ruined. The way the problem was dealt with was first class. We were treated with respect and never felt we were wasting anyone's time. Any time they said something would happen, it did. It's just a shame these air con's are actually IN the room - never seen that before in any hotel.

The lobby is spacious and smart and there is a restaurant there and to the other side is the bar, and beyond the bar the small but well kept pool area. There is also a concierge desk who are very willing and not sales-pushy to offer advice and you can purchase park tickets and i-trolley passes. The hotels 'exercise' room is also on the groundfloor, there never seemed to be anyone using it, my husband used it, all machines modern and good. The room is a good size and looks fairly new. There is a nice bathroom that is clean with a good shower and fresh towels daily. There is a fridge, microwave and coffee machine. Also you have an iron and ironing board. We had a new flat screen telly delivered whilst we were there (they were upgrading all the TV's) there is a small desk with internet access. If you check in ask for a room at the back of the hotel, that way you get a great view of seaworld and thier coasters! The rooms are cleaned immaculately every day. The only fault we can say is that our toilet blocked one evening and it took them a while to come up and fix it, but they didnt expect us to wait around so we went out and by the time we came back it was fixed and the floor had been thoroughly cleaned with bleach, so we couldnt knock the effort made to sort it out! There is an ice machine on every floor and also a laundry room. We didnt use the pool but there is plenty of loungers and shade and looked pleasent enought, only thing is that it is at the front of the hotel next to the car park, although there are plenty of shrubs/trees surrounding it so dont be too put off by that. The bar is a little pricey by Orlando standards but then it is a hotel bar, and a hilton hotel aswell so you kinda have to expect that. Overall we thought this hotel was brilliant.

We requested a non-smoking room and even though these requests are always described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153requests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and not guaranteed we noted it was for health reasons. Well at check in the staff person we had was a little slow and by that I mean not physically. Sorry but she did not belong at the front desk! The process was quick thank goodness and as we always do we went straight to the room before lugging our bags to do an inspection. We exited the elevator onto an obvious smoking room floor. As we entered the room it was like entering a burning tenement in New York. I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced it! The smell of smoke was unbelievable. Back down to the front desk and this time was helped by a nice girl who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153found\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a room on the 8th floor. This room was smoke free but the wife and I did smell what can be described as a sour mildewy smell as if standing water that had not dried. We hoped that the smell was due to the air conditioner being set on low and went about our business. The second day of our stay I happened to walk barefoot over near the air conditioner and the floor was soaked through approximately 3 feet around the area! Hence the mildewy smell. No problem for us because this room was the last of the non smoking rooms so we jacked up the air and lit a candle. We notified the management upon checkout. Overall the hotel was clean and most all personnel were professional. The pool area is a little on the small side and the food at the restaurant was pretty good. No breakfast for us but the hamburger and fries I had was good as was the wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sandwich.

Upon arriving, we were given our room keys and headed to our room. The girl at the front desk didn't warn us that it was a \"smoking\" room, but I could smell it as soon as we got off of the elevator. Then, a wave of smoke hit us as soon as we opened the door. (My mother smokes, so I'm used to being around smoke, but she doesn't smoke in bed and the Hilton's rooms have no windows so the smoke here is strong and stale.) I immediately went to the front desk switch rooms and I was told that they had absolutely no non-smoking rooms left. I explained to her that I specifically booked a non-smoking room, per the options available online when booking, and I showed her my confirmation page proving my non-smoking purchase. She basically said that booking a non-smoking room only means that you're requesting a non-smoking room and that they can't honor all requests. I then asked if they could transfer us to another Hilton, since there are so many in the area, and she claimed that there was nothing that she could do. I came back a second time and was told again that nothing could be done. Thankfully, I ran into a manager on the way back to my room and, after about 1 hour of pleading, a room \"suddenly opened up.\" One positive thing about the hotel: The Hilton's side street has a sidewalk & goes right into SeaWorld's parking lot. You can also take the SeaWorld shuttle directly to Aquatica from SeaWorld, but Aquatica completely closed their entrances around 11 am twice during our week due to \"maximum capacity.\" We attempted to take the hotel's shuttle once, but it was running almost 30 minutes late & we didn't make it to Aquatica before they sealed the entrance. We left really early & walked the 2nd time, but Aquatica doesn't have very many slides and the wait for most of them was over 45 minutes.

Hilton also offered a free shuttle daily to and from Seaworld. However... the hotel IS within walking distance to Seaworld, but the walk is not user-friendly. There are no sidewalk areas. We had to cross over and walk in along the side of a busy road and through the Seaworld parking lot. We did use the shuttle to get there the next day, but the return shuttles were very limited, and only come back at 5 and 7 pm (although Seaworld closes at 10 pm in the summer months because of nighttime shows/fireworks). So we found ourselves walking back to the hotel, at night, in the dark, through service areas/back parking lots of another nearby hotel, through dark parking lots and roads. It was very unnerving. The hotel should consider adding a later shuttle during the summer months to accommodate people who are going to Seaworld and staying for the summer night shows.

It is in the corner of Central Florida Parkway and Westwood Boulevard, off I-4, very close to the Premium Outlets and Sea World is just behind it. Check in was a breeze, early check-in is possible depending on availability as well as late check out. I was able to get late check out until 1pm. Steven in the front desk was very helpful with directions, recommendations and more. On the check in moment, they give you a coupon for 2 bottles of water in their pantry and a 2x1 drink coupon in the hotel\u00c2\u00b4s bar per stay. Breakfast was good, has sausages, eggs, biscuits, muffins, cereal juices, bread, yogurt, etc. It is a $10 buffet. All in all i had a pleseant stay.

The beds were very comfortable, a foam matress so there was absolutely no squeeking for sleep-movers. The space in the room was very comfortable, and we never turned the tv on once. The mini-pantry set up was convienance to stash snacks and juices away and the bathroom was very roomy. We checked into our room late and realized that the carpet had torn away from the bathroom door's threshhold and wanted that fixed in the morning. The next day maintenance said they would check on it while we were out, and when we came back that night, they told us they needed to just move us to a new room to fix the carpet. This was a bit inconvienant, but they gave us coupons for a free breakfasts and a beautiful fruit basket. totally ok with our family. Our new room was right outside of the elevator and i was worried it would be noisy but i never heard anything. We had to use the washer/dryer one night too and it was easy and fast. ($2/wash, $2/dry) It is an easy off/on to I-4, very easy to get to disneyworld and we found a great side road that got us right to universal (and past a wal-mart for incidentals!). Being a walk away from seaworld was super convienant too. I ended up leaving seaworld with our toddler about 30 minutes before my spouse and that was ok because it was just a walk back, and the child could just keep napping in the stroller, i didn't have to move him into a car seat or anything. We never had a hard time finding a parking space at the hotel and the hotel was very clean. Their breakfast was top notch, well worth the $10 BUT i would have liked it to be complimentary too.

They were very apologetic that my room was not ready when I arrived to check in even though I arrived 2 hours early. They really did not owe me any apologies. They will let you store your luggage behind the desk if you are early for check in or if you need a place to keep it after you check out.

The room itself is spacious and as promised by the management letter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c exceptionally clean, we had a king bed (they did not ask us at check-in, as we had a pre-paid voucher, if this is ok, I would have prefered to have 2 q, but was too tired to change room). Big screen TV showed a lot of channels, there was a fridge and microwave in room. Coffeemachine did not work either as there was missing a part. Pot was broken. Bathroom looked new though it had some spots on the walls. Good massage showerhead and waterpressure. Lots of towels. Nice toiletries (though not replaced). Real tiles around tub. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tiny closet with ironing equipment, an extra blanket, a tray for the suitcase and some hangers for the clothes. Avoid to take a room right across the ice- and vending-machines, like we had (601) as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terribly noisy all night with the machines running ouside! The nice pool was under construction for some more days, but it looked invitingly, though cars parked directly alongside. Lots of parking around the building is provided. Lobby is spacious, part of it is a restaurant with plenty of tables, there is a nice sitting area with comfortable sofas. Lady at front desk was helpful, though it did not work out. We paid about 70.- inclusive tax.", "Date": "December 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "south lanarks", "Title": "\u201cpeaceful hilton gardens\u201d", "Author": "destressed", "ReviewID": "UR5904293", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed at the beginning of Sept 06.

I-Ride stop is right outside the hotel and there's a trolley every 20 minutes or so which takes you up to the main drag of International Drive. A 15 minute ride gets you to the main hub where most of the restaurants and shops are. We only used the restaurant in the hotel a couple of times but we did get room service on a regular basis (too tired to move most nights!). Food was excellent (try the ribs) and the staff making and serving it were helpful and efficient. You can also order pizza and chinese to be delivered to your room if you fancy something a bit different. Reception staff were particularly helpful offering help and advise on the best shops, things to do and organising taxis when needed.

Our bathroom was covered in hair, and when we asked for NO housekeeping service we still received it. I must say that the hotel staff are great! (obviously not our housekeeper that day). But the front desk upon check in was great, and any encounter that i had with them during the stay was great. I contacted the manager after leavign (it was a weekend) and they were gracious enough to refund a night of my stay.

This one, at the Sea World Gate, did not come up to the same standards the Hilton chains are noted for. Upon arrival, there were no caddies for our luggage. We had to go hunting around the parking lot for one. Next, while unloading our luggage in the room, we found half eaten candy in the drawer next to the bed. The previous occupant left a shoe under the bed and it was obvious the room had not been cleaned (especially under the beds) to the standards I've become accustomed to in a Hilton hotel. The bathroom floor needed a scrubbing, and the toilet paper rolls were almost empty. Normally, I leave a tip for housekeeping upon check out, but in this case I did not. At the pool, there were no towels. The container for the soiled towels was full and no one came to replace them with clean towels. We were at the pool for two hours and there surely was ample time for someone in housekeeping to check this out. The spa was not working (temperature problems) and we asked about this. The hotel employee thought it very funny and told us it would be fixed \"whenever\". The restaurant had a very good breakfast buffet but the lunch and dinner menu was lacking and the dinner we ate at the hotel was overpriced and the food mediocre. Upon check out, we had to go hunting for a luggage caddy again. When we asked at the front desk the desk clerk said to look around, and we circled the parking lot twice until we found one. This hotel was a disappointment and I doubt I will stay at this Hilton Garden Inn again.
