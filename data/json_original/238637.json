In a fab location with the city sights including the palace just a few minutes walk away. Staff were attentive and helpful carrying luggage and arranging transport to the airport when requested. Only drawbacks none of us had any window views which was disappointing and the free standing air con units were noisy and had to have a hose draped out of the window. We would have appreciated tea/coffee facilities in the rooms but this is a personal preference. Breakfast was nice and our 4 teenagers enjoyed it!! Beware of getting a taxi from the airport though - as there was 8 of us we had to take 2 and it cost us 45 euros each taxi. The hotel will arrange a mini bus for larger partys for only 60 euros which is quite a saving.

It is 2-star, I would easily give it 3\u00bd. Located in old part of Madrid on a pedestrian shopping street, it is so central that you cannot ask for more. About 5 min walk to Royal Palace, 15 min to the three famous museums (Prado, Thyssen-Bornemisza, Reina Sofia). 2 min to the nearest metro station (Sol), but I never took the metro during my three day stay, there is simply no need if you do not want to get to the suburbs. The hotel is in an historical building next to a lovely old church (do not worry, I never heard the bells, either they do not ring or the walls are well built). Inside, it is extremely modern and looks as if it was renovated yesterday. Lifts are glass throughout and work faultlessly. Large room, large bathroom, large mirror, hairdryer, enough hangers in the wardrobe. At some hotels you need to get under the bed and pull out the cord of the bedside lamp to charge your phone, but not here! There are sockets everywhere to charge your gadgets or to use your extra things for your hair. Bed comfortable and large, both pillows and blanket very nice. The bathroom wall and doors are of frosted glass. The paint in my room was unblemished, the bathroom tiles all beautiful, and at least two dozen spotlights everywhere so you could get exactly as much or as little light as you wanted. Breakfast was included (not all Madrid hotels offer that), standard continental, nothing special, but enough of everything. There was both crusty bread and sliced one and a toaster. The attendants were around all the time to fill up and they also kept the breakfast room fresh and clean at all times. Reception staff was friendly and always present. Plenty of (tourist) restaurants and caf\u00e9s in the area, at daytime lots of small shops on Calle Arenal and on side streets. A large quality department store (El Corte Ingl\u00e9s) is a few blocks away. Altogether, it was a much, much higher class hotel than I expected and a very pleasant stay. A real luxury for budget expense.

I wasn't expecting to much but when I entered into room \"wow\". The room, average size, was renewed recently and the decoration was really nice. It was very clean and it is kept clean. I've read that there are 2 parties in the hotel; one renewed and one old. So I can't tell to much about old rooms (if they still exist). Our modern designed bathroom was spacious, with a shower and two sinks. Although the room (210) was on the pedestrian street, it wasn't too noisy, I could sleep easily even on saturday. The location cannot be better! If you're looking to be in the center of everything, this is the place. You can all most go everywhere by walk. As it is on a busy street you can find anything you look for. In addition the metro station (Opera) is just next to hotel. The bed was huge and very comfortable (two big beds linked to each other for double room). There was a flat screen TV in the room (you have to put 5\u20ac as the deposit of the remote-controller), a desk and a chair, a big and nice wardrobe, a little balcony, a safe-deposit, a minibar (no coffee or tea). There are vendor machines in the hotel from where you can buy coke, beer, coffee etc. for 1\u20ac. These are the good points of the hotel. Now I should say that there was a very bad smell in the hotel's corridors. It was terrible and I couldn't find what it was really. Fortunately it wasn't inside the room, at least in our case. It is important for me to start the day with a good breakfast but it wasn't the case at all! The hotel's breakfast was very poor. Some croissants, 1 sort of cheese and ham, cornflakes and that's all!

Upon arriving and reporting to reception, I was told by the staff that we would be upgraded to a better room. No questions were asked as to why, and this upgrade was, of course, welcomed. The ordeal started with me having to wait for over half an hour before the room was cleaned, even though we had informed the hotel of my arrival time and expected check-in time. The list of problems and inconvenience did not end here. Alarm bells started sounding when all of the floors had notices posted on the walls reading the hotel was being refurbished and that it apologises for the \"inconvenience.\" On that note, it soon became apparent why we had been \"upgraded\" to another room. The following Saturday morning, we were awoken at approximately 8 a.m. by intensive, industrial-style construction work, taking place inside the hotel. Banging, drilling, hammering, loud shouting by workers across the hallway - it felt like this was taking place literally outside our room door - and indeed, this was the case. The noise of what could only be described as that of a neighbourhood being demolished was only intensified when the cleaners started their duties with wailing, old hoovers, bumping into surrounding walls and penetrating what became apparent were paper thin walls. We had a late Friday the night before and certainly did not expect to receive this sort unwanted wake-up call, especially during a weekend. The ordeal was only made worse when my very valid points of concern were bemet with rude, arrogant and unapologetic attitude by a reception staff member. He suggested I had no reason to complain seeing we had been upgraded to a 'better' room - furthermore, he completely dismissed my argument that I would have checked in to another of the dozens of hotels situated just across the street, had I known the Francisco was undergoing construction work. The reception worker angrily offered to move us to another floor as, he admitted, work would continue on the Monday. As a result we attended the wedding on very little sleep, but were very relieved that there would be a break in works on Sunday, so we could get much needed rest. Our hopes were not met when the paper thin walls proved a nightmare yet again - the cleaning staff once more started hoovering with the noisiest wailing hoovers at 8 a.m, waking us up. This hotel is impossible to sleep in! Overall, we left Madrid feeling exhausted, and more importantly, feeling cheated. The attitude and unprofessionalism of the reception staff of this hotel is shocking. Not only were they unaccommodating to guests, many did not speak any English, and proceeded with addressing guests in Spanish on the assumption they would understand. The breakfast at this hotel also left MUCH to be desired. I would strongly recommend anyone against staying here.

My tour went to Paris after Madrid. The hotel we stayed in there was more \"American\" and closer to what we would consider a \"nice\" hotel. The problem was that we had to take the metro to the very last stop, then walk for fifteen minutes to get there. This was a huge pain. We had been spoiled by the Hotel Francisco being so close to eveything we wanted to see in Madrid (right next to Puerta del Sol) and being able to go back to the hotel whenever we needed to.

I wouldnt recommend this hotel because i think its worth to pay a bit more but have at least air con, in such a hot city.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cVery Mixed Quality\u201d", "Author": "Evs_family", "ReviewID": "UR7293351", "Content": "The top floor has been refurbished and looked very nice.

Overall Madrid is a great city to go and visit, it\u2019s compact enough to walk around (if you don\u2019t mind walking), the metro is clean and simple however you do need to be very weary of the \u2018pick-pockets\u2019 as I had a near miss!

The room was tiny and dull. The bathroom was the size of a wardrobe and looked nothing like the pictures shown on the website. There was no bath. only something that looked like a bath but was smaller than a shower tray!!! The first night we didnt get any sleep because it was so noisy, we might as well have been sleeping on the street as the windows were so thin we could hear everything going on outside. When the noise from outside finally quietened.. at around half 7, builders started working. The hotel was being renovated at the time... which they failed to tell us on booking!! The noise was so loud I had to ring reception and shout down the phone, only to be told that it was noise from the cleaners... ah cleaners don't use hammers and power tools! We asked could we swap to a quieter room and were given a rude unfriendly response and were given an even smaller room.. I didnt think one even existed but I was wrong. The bathroom was tiny, and old, all the door frame was rotten, and again it had no bath. We had a lovely view of scaffolding and builders mmmmm! But at least it was quiet during the night. The builders were noisy every morning though. Breakfast was terrible. You were shown to a table area which had bread and a toaster and some cereal with warm milk yuk! Anyway now that I've got that off my chest my advice is, firstly dont go to this hotel and if you're broke and have to then invest in a pair of ear plugs and a large bottle of vodka! The only good thing about this place is the location which is great but you would probably be more comfortable sleeping in a doorway! P.S There was no safety box in either of the rooms we were in. Some staff were friendly and others not at all, none had much english, and the cleaners could win an award for being the noisiest crowd of b*****s in spain!!!", "Date": "January 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cGreat Price...Great location\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3983272", "Content": "This hotel is a real find. It is located a few blocks from Puerta del Sol, the Plaza Mayor and the Royal Palace on Calle de Arenal. It is within walking distance to the Prado. My family and I were part of a group of students who had studied for a month in Salamanca. There were 20 of us in the group. We paid 70 euros per night for a double, breakfast included. We thought this was an excellent price for the location. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is a small lobby on the street level and a large lounge on the 1st floor. The dining area is on the 6th floor. We extended our stay after the students left, and paid 100 euros per night for a triple. The rooms are standard size for Europe. Some do not have air conditioning. The bathroom of our double was on the small side, but did have a shower and tub. Our bathroom in the triple was large. We were able to leave our luggage at no charge at the hotel when we spent two nights in Sevilla. The staff can arrainge for tickets to bullfights or sporting events, but we prefered to buy ours at the gate. This hotel has a sister hotel, Hotel Paris, located in the Puerta del Sol. We definately plan to stay here again.
