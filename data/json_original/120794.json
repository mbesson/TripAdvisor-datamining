This time, however, there were a few things that just didn't hold up as well. 1) The breakfast service was terrible. It shouldn't take 25 minutes to get a basic omelette from a limited menu. Their computer-order system at this property means that you have to pre-pay for the food without ever seeing an individual - you can't even tell if the cook is working. We had to ask someone at the desk twice before we got our food, and this delay ended up causing us to be late for our customer appointment. By itself, this is enough to keep me from ever staying here again. Bottom line - either go back to a buffet or to real servers who can tell you if they can't deliver in a reasonable time, so you can just move on to your business day in a timely manner. 2) I understand the desire to use shampoo dispensers instead of individual bottles - it's a cost-cutting measure that really doesn't cause a problem for most customers. However, \"bath gel\" isn't soap. Finding out that there is no bar soap in the bathroom at 6:30 AM is NOT pleasant, and a little sign stating it's available at the front desk is worthless. Who is really going to get dressed to go down to the front desk so that they can come back upstairs to get undressed and take a shower? The sign saying it's a \"green\" practice is just insulting - go ahead and at least admit it's a cost-cutting measure and be honest about it - or better yet, just put the soap back into the bathrooms. 3) Toilet paper in the rooms - unusable. About 2\" narrower than a standard roll, and so thin as to be worthless for its intended use. 'Nuff said. 4) Why would a hotel spend so much money on large-screen TVs in the rooms, then have them set up with the format incorrect so that everything is either squished or fuzzy? That's just a lack of attention to detail, and should have been handled when they were installed. It doesn't cost any more to get this sort of thing right.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore MD", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel but......\u201d", "Author": "RichardMadow", "ReviewID": "UR118819632", "Content": "This hotel was exactly as it should be - clean, friendly, fairly spacious with simply decorated rooms. Don't expect the Hyatt Regency and you may be quite pleased. However - the heating system was incredibly loud and the fan could not be kept on constantly, causing it to loudly restart throughout the night. It was seriously loud - every fifteen minutes or so it sounded like the Indy 500 itself was coming to the room! It would not have been so bad if the noise were steady but the on and off was incredibly annoying.

We were arriving late into IND and I wasn't familiar enough with the area to want to drive around late at night. So my goal was to find someplace decent close to the airport and with on-site food for hungry travelers. When we landed at the airport and found all of the food places already locked up and rain pouring down outside, I was especially glad I'd thought of that part. We found the hotel fairly easily (although warning to travelers leaving IND--there's MAJOR construction in that area with lane closures all over the place). The people at the front desk were welcoming and helpful. When we asked about food, they suggested that we place our order and they would prepare it while we put our bags in our room. This worked well--the food was hot and surprisingly good when we came back downstairs, and the small on-site bar was a welcome surprise. The best part of the hotel, however, was the comfortable and spacious room we stayed in. The door opened up to a \"living area\" part with a couch, small bar area with a coffee maker and refrigerator, and an ample desk. Beyond this was a sizeable area with the beds, which were extremely comfortable. A large TV was centered so that it could be viewed from either area. The entire room was modern-looking and very clean.

We were able to leave our car for up to 14d with our overnite room stay - when you consider parking rates at the airport, this probably meant our room cost something under $25-30!

Plus, there was a huge conference downtown and all the hotels were booked up (including this Hyatt Place). Check was fine. The check in person was proactive and nice enough to give us various options on different floors. Room is big and comfortable, with a wet bar area (with sink & fridge), comfortable desk, free wifi, and sofa. Everything was clean albeit basic - use your own soap & shampoo. And it had an amazing huge, flat screen TV. The bed was comfortable. Not as comfortable as the Westin or Starwood beds, nor even Homewood Suites by Hilton, but I had a good night's sleep. And I'm pretty picky on beds. The gym was nice for a hotel gym, especially a non-resort-lower-level-hotel gym. Had 2 treadmills, 2 elliptical machines, 1 bike and weight machines in a pretty big room and all the cardio machines had TV's on it. Ok, the cons - The location is pretty drab. You're right next to the freeway. (But the noise never bothered me.) I went for a run in the morning and was running down highways and by factories. But what can you expect. It's an airport hotel. I didn't use the pool, but it's pretty small and noticed it didn't have hot tub. You can pretty much only splash around and lay out by it, not do laps. But again, it's by the highway, not exactly a 'lay out' and sun yourself area. My only gripe was breakfast. They ran out of oatmeal really early. Like 9 am. And it's supposed to go to 9:30 am. Plus, the food was mediocre. Cheap white bread, bagels & english muffins. Coffee was chauky - Have had better at McDonald's and Homewood suites. And the fruit they have has some kind of sugar solution so it tastes fake. Overall, this is the second time I've stayed at Hyatt Place. I'm a huge fan. Great price, good amenities, breakfast is included and nice room. Would stay in a heartbeat again. And it really has a nicer atmosphere. Very open floor plan, in lobby & in room, so it always feels airy and relaxing and bright. I've also have converted my husband to the joys of Hyatt Place. We usually stay at Holiday Inn Expresses when we just want to 'stay at a place' when we're not looking for a leisurely, luxurious vacation, but rather a place to full a specific purpose we're at the location (marathon, event, wedding, etc.).

The design is inspired and we really liked the separate sitting area with the sectional couch, as well as the nice little work desk. The mini-fridge and sink area were also a big plus (although our fridge didn't cool sodas much beyond room temperature even overnight). The downside here was the \"Gallery Host\" concept in which the front desk clerks are also responsible for getting drinks and preparing snacks and hot food 24/7. In theory this is great -- we were delighted that we'd be able to get meals and snacks in the evening, right at the hotel. But the front desk people seemed really to dislike this part of their job and, in our stay, treated it as a nuisance and a bother. Hyatt Place has a great free continental breakfast set out buffet-style (as well as hot items for purchase). But, again, its success is dependent on staff. On our two mornings there the front desk clerk was deep in conversation with the shuttle driver before, during, and after breakfast, not refilling items in the breakfast area, clearing plates, or cleaning up spilled food from previous guests. Another morning a second clerk was shouting across the lobby to her colleague about some sort of custody or childcare problem. On check-out, a woman I assume was the manager (she wasn't wearing the sweater-set uniform of the other clerks) gave us a really hard time about a food item on the bill that we asked to have removed (it wasn't ours). Considering the many other items on the bill, most more expensive, that we weren't disputing, I was surprised at her response: she insisted mistakes were \"impossible\" because of their automated system. Our overall bill was several hundred dollars, so why she wanted to go five rounds about a $4 charge was beyond me. Again, we really liked the rooms and the breakfast, as well as the WiFi and the fitness room, but this was a pretty lame staff all around, with the exception of our young check-in clerk and a friendly airport shuttle driver.

No smoking is allowed in the building even though the website offers smoking rooms. The tv also does not offer much channels unless you pay an additional fee. Those were the only negatives.

However, with early flights, I've found that it is sometimes just easier to say near the airport. In my most recent trip, I saw winter weather coming and decided to head down early. I decided to book this stay at the last minute. Rack rates were $89/night on the Hyatt website, but I booked it for a $37 bid on Priceline ($49 inclusive of taxes and fees). I know that you can't do park/fly on Priceline, but this seems to be an often won 2.5 star hotel in the Indy airport zone. I was dropped off at the hotel around noon and was greeted warmly and immediately allowed to check in. I was given a King room at the end of the hall on the fourth floor. The room had two living areas, one with the bed and another with a convertible couch, desk (with free wifi), sink, and small fridge. Other amenities included a coffee maker, coffee and tea, alarm clock, and a 42-inch HDTV. The TV had a connections port that allowed you to hook basically any kind of input easily into the TV if needed (composite, component, VGA, HDMI, etc). About the only complaint I had was with the bathroom, which was fairly tiny and had only one light, which made it kind of dark. The hotel offers a free shuttle to the airport, which is convenient. There is not really much around the hotel, though, so be aware that obtaining outside food might be hard. I walked across the street to a Marathon station for some snacks, and there is a Dennys a bit down the road, but that was too far for slushy weather without sidewalks. The hotel offers cafe-style food 24 hours a day, and I ended up ordering two sandwiches during my stay. You can grab to-go food from a display or you can order hot food via a touch-screen located in the food area. The sandwiches I ordered took about 5-10 minutes to prepare but were oven toasted and cost about $8, with soda costing another $2. A free continental breakfast is offered (along with paid hot fare), but I left before it started so I cannot comment on that. In the end, I was very happy with the room and the fact that I could get some hot food at the hotel without paying exorbitant room service fees. The staff were always eager to help, and there was a touch of style and class to the place. I would not hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cSomething to\u201d", "Author": "hohohaha", "ReviewID": "UR11194945", "Content": "Read good review about this hotel, and choose based on recommendation.

Even at a higher price it would be well worth it. Not included in the previous reviews are a couple of things. First, the breakfast that is free includes cereal, toast, fruit, juice and coffee. If you want hot entrees, there is a menu and the charges are a reasonable $5.50. However, the set-up for the breakfast was top notch; neat, tidy, and first class. Also, the workout room is definitely a step up. Free weights, machines and nice cardio equipment was all evident. The hotel is 100% non-smoking and about three minutes from the airport. The staff is great as well. Jessica checked me in and couldn't have been nicer. She arranged to have the hotel shuttle (which is 24 hours by the way) pick me up at the Avis lot rather then at the airport. This place is a great example of finding a great place on Priceline, but I wouldn't hesitate to pay more in the future to stay there again. Cheers.

Our experience was just ok. We chose this hotel for the Hyatt name as well as the parking package. Our room was pre-paid and booked through a travel agent. We received a printed confirmation with arrival/departure info and confirmation number. When we arrived, there was no record of our reservation. After contacting our travel agent, we were able to get into a room. We reserved a room with two beds and a couch, but our room only had one bed and a couch. We made due. The hotel is currently being remodeled; changing from AmeriSuites to Hyatt Place. The hotel did their best to keep it contained, but there was very little parking available due to many dumpsters and machinery in the back lot. Our room was on the 4th floor. It was beautifully decorated, but quite dirty! The new carpeting was already filthy and there was mold in the toilet. The bathroom floor had not been swept as there was a lot of hair and dirt. (I am by far a neat-freak. It was pretty gross!) The bed was SO VERY COMFORTABLE! I did lay on the pullout sofa with our kids for a while and it was not that bad for a pull-out. All of the linens were new and clean. We did not use the pool because we wanted to be well rested for our trip. The HDTV was great a great alternative for the kids! There was NO FOOD available at the hotel which contradicted the info we received. They do have a few menus at the front desk of places that will deliver. (We did not have a phone book or area info book in our room). We were not able to gain access to the internet in our room -even though the front desk clerk said the whole hotel is wireless. The staff was friendly and helpful. The shuttle was prompt both ways. I think next time we will try the Adam's Mark across the street just to see how it compares. The prices were just about the same. We thought it would be nicer here- maybe after the remodeling? That was not even an issue for us. There was not a lot of noise after we checked in about 4:30pm. (The air conditioner in the room was pretty loud - and VERY cold!) Our biggest disappointment was the cleanliness of the room.

When we were ready to go we went down to the lobby, had free hot breakfast (which was very good) and then got right on the shuttle van and went to the airport.
