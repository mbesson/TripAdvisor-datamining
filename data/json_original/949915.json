{"Reviews": [{"Content": "We loved our Apartment! I arranged for a girls weekend to Barcelona and I'm so glad we chose the Caputxins as our base. Six of us shared the apartment, and there's plenty of space, great kitchen and balcony. All of the furniture, decor and equipment is very new and modern. There are 2 bathrooms with powerful showers. Though do watch the hot water if you are all trying to get ready to go out together. We arrived early and were able to check in straight away and simiarly on departure we could keep our room until 2pm which was really handy. Also, we kept our cases until 6pm at the offices nearby. Christopher, on reception, is really helpful.The apartment block is just off of the Ramblas, so is in an ideal location. Only downside we found was it could be a bit noisy at night with other guests returning to their apartments.We had a fantastic time in Barcelona and would definitely recommend the Caputxins as a very comfortable base.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR358127845", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "cejay8"}, {"Content": "Fantastic apartment What a gem- apartment was fabulous...the staff was very friendly.
