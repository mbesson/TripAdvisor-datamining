Location:You would think that Hatagaya is a major station but it's not. You need to take Keio Line to reach Hatagaya and the frequency of trains is not very good (as compared to others in Tokyo).Hotel is just a walk away from the station, which is good.Check in: Staff just did not understand English, especially the night staff. We had such a tough time in making them understand that we just need a taxi in morning. Finally, we had to call Taxi ourselves.The check in time is 4 PM and Check out time is 10 AM. Wonder what they do in that 6 hour time frame cos the rooms aren't that big enough which would require ages to clean. Ok, this is not rare for Tokyo so this should not be counted as a problem. They promised us that our bags will be transferred to our rooms but when we came back at 11 PM, our bags were all over the lobby. This was not acceptable. Either you promise or you don't. Do not make false claims.Rooms: We booked a single and a double room. To my surprise, both the rooms were almost similar, except in the double room, they have managed to cramp in a sofa. Bed size is exactly same, wonder why they charged me seperate amounts for the same. Beds were comfy and liveable. Bathrooms (as per Tokyo's standards) are tiny but well furnished.I would recommed this hotel to only backpackers and no one else. People with children or heavy luggage, please avoid as they do not have any bell boy services or even a luggage trolley. I know this is a budget hotel but I have stayed in other budget hotels also and trust me, they were a lot better than this one. I have been told that other Sakura Hotels in Tokyo are much better off than this one.", "Date": "Oct 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR603485777", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "gary25"}, {"Content": "Very Clean. Stayed in this property the first time i was in Tokyo. it's situated about 3 minutes from the Hatagaya subway station, just off Shinjuku. For a budget hotel this is actually quite good.The rooms were small but the beds were reasonably comfortable and bathroom... tiny (as usual.. for japan hotels).Breakfast was normal, toast and butter/jam with coffee/tea.If you are a backpacker with a little more budget to spare than a shared hostel, or if you are not intending to spend a lot of time lazing in a 5-stars hotel, but just to use it to sleep, this is actually a very pleasant hotel to stay.
