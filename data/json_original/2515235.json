Check-in was pain free and if you can squeeze yourselves and your luggage into the compact and bijou lift, you'll be in your room in no time. The rooms are clean and modern with plenty of storage space and a great bathroom with shower. Tea-making resources were a bit on the sparse side for the British visitor, but there is a great little shop up the road which sells teabags and milk (and Oreos, Doritos and Mountain Dew - those great French staples!) We did however spend the first two nights being kept awake by the aggressive and extremely noisy aircon which - despite the high-tech panel - is actually controlled by reception. There should be some indication above the switch that this is the case. We didn't open the windows because of the traffic noise (the double-double glazing is very effective at keeping out the tooting and parping...) so it was a bit warm, but probably only at the height of summer. The neighbourhood is smashing - we found lovely Italian and Indian restaurants for evening meals and several typical Parisian caffs for breakfast, but if you can't do without your skinny latte and seaweed rolls there's a Starbucks just round the corner and plenty of sushi joints. There's even an English pub (The Bowler) opposite the shop if you miss your warm beer and KP nuts. All in all an enjoyable stay (apart from the aircon noise) in a cute hotel in a wonderful and romantic city.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice place but quite compact!\u201d", "Author": "wackojacko007", "ReviewID": "UR118597905", "Content": "I took ages trying to find a suitable hotel for a few nights midweek stay in Paris and finally settled on this hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent it is very close to a metro station and within easy walking distance of many of the main tourist attractions of Paris, the downside to this of course means that it is on a busy corner of a narrow street with traffic passing night and day. However, the double glazing works fine and the room is very quiet during the night except for the odd car horn or boy racer with a loud exhaust. We had no problems at all with music from any nearby nightclubs / bars that other reviewers had mentioned although we were on a mid week stay rather than a weekend. The outside of the hotel is nothing spectacular to look at but once inside it is a quiet and calming oasis with a modern clean and well decorated interior, although the reception area is quite small. All of the people we met on reception were friendly and helpful and they spoke excellent English which was good as I do not speak very good French although my feeble attempts did appear to be appreciated. As other reviewers mentioned the elevator is tiny and two people with bags will easily fill it, I can't see this being too much of a problem as I didn't intend spending too much time in the elevator any way. As with the reception area, our room (a Superior type) was very modernly decorated and very clean, although it was a little dark due to the colour scheme. The room was small but perfectly adequate as we did not spend much time in it anyway. Although I don't think I would have wanted the standard room as they were slightly smaller still. The ensuite bathroom was very nicely decorated with excellent quality modern fittings (shower but no bath) very compact but perfectly useable. I had requested a quiet room 'not on the ground floor or near the elevator' and we were placed on the 4th floor probably as far from the elevator as the size of the hotel could allow. Unfortunately we did seem to be located very close to the cleaners cupboard and had annoying noises disturbing us from quite early each morning. The hotel was very quiet during the night apart from the annoying guests who have not learnt how to close a door without slamming it (not the hotels fault of course) The biscuit situation - disappointed to say the least. On arrival there were just two teabags and one, yes one! tiny carton of milk. I know the French do not drink tea like the English but a small gesture of a few extra tea bags and milk would have been nice. There were also only two carboard biscuits in the room which for a 4* hotel seems a bit tight. All of this was of course resolved with a quick visit to the local Supermarket to pick up a good supply. We did leave a pile of tea bag wrappers on the side hoping that they would take the hint but sadly they never.The rooms were left spotless by the cleaners each day and the beds were comfortable with good quality linen. We could only receive about 6 tv channels, of which only two were in English, again this was not a real issue as I didn't come to France to watch t.v. We can not comment on the breakfast as we did not eat at the hotel (and it was 18 euro's per person which at first I thought sounded high but once you get outside you realise it's about the norm for Paris) One mention of the air conditioning, it works very well and it does need to as the rooms get very hot, however we did not want to open the windows due to street noise, but the alternative is to receive a blast of cold air directly over one side of the room so if you have any flesh on show it will probably get iced. The control panel in the room does not actually turn the air con off, this has to be done at reception. It may have been an idea for them to put up a small notice in the room to advise this. A Word of caution, on arrival at Gare du Nord we caught a Taxi to the hotel, it took about 20 mins and cost around 12 euros. We asked the hotel to call us a taxi for the return journey and I noticed the meter in the taxi was set 4 euros higher at the start of the journey. With delays in traffic it cost 25 euros to do the same trip! I'm not sure if its a bit of a con to start the meter higher or if there is some agreement between hotels and Taxi firm? Overall a very enjoyable stay, I am a light sleeper so perhaps others would not be disturbed by the noises that kept waking me up. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone for a short stay but I did find it slightly claustraphobic due to its dark decor and size.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jeddah, Saudi Arabia", "Title": "\u201cVery small but classy & clean with an acceptable location\u201d", "Author": "LGhaznawi", "ReviewID": "UR117101661", "Content": "I stayed for one week with my sister & had a twin bedroom (we were a group of adults) - Clean & neat: The room was very clean when we first check-in but in the daily cleaning routine I had to keep asking for clean towels, sheets .. etc. I liked the fact that smoking & pets are not allowed as they badly affect the place hygiene. - Decoration: the rooms decoration is different & elegant in a new way. I went in very hot summer so I used the AC and it was very good however only the receptionist can control the temperature for you. - Friendly staff: We kept emailing for weeks before I confirmed my booking & got the room. The receptionist is also the concierge, the bar tender & the waitress which was a new concept to me but I found this as a common practice in Paris hotels. - Toilets: that's important to me! New & well equipped, I loved it. However, as a Muslim we prefer toilets in which we can use the shower to wash after, you know, using the toilet and in this hotel this wasn't feasible by any means as the water sources were away of the toilet seat. In one of the rooms I tried (I missed my flight & went back for 2 days & stayed in 2 different rooms) the place of the toilet seat was away & totally separate from the rest of the bathroom which wasn't convenient. - Location: the name fooled me, I thought it'll be closer to Champs Elysee but it was like 7-10 minutes walk but that was pretty much okay. there's a Starbucks & grocery at walkable distances too. - Hotel Size: it was shocking to see a 4 star hotel in this small size! Each floor may have maximum 6 rooms and the rooms' spaces, the lobby and the elevator are small. - Value for money: We paid at different rates, all were around 285-310 euros which I consider expensive for such a small hotel! You can find it cheaper online if you made an early booking. - Noise: there wasn't lots of noise but u know if someone is drunk and shouting in the street, or if another stupid person kept on using his car horn at midnight, sure u will hear them. - Internet WiFi was available for free & it was good", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location\u201d", "Author": "Allhart88", "ReviewID": "UR116778798", "Content": "Charming, clean hotel close to it all and the metro.

Yes, the rooms are small, but HELLO!!! You are in Paris. If you like staying in a real boutique hotel, that's not commercialized and mass made, this would be the perfect example. The rooms are very clean, very modern, packed with lots of charm and clean lines.. no details were spared, and every space in the room was well utilized. The shower was nice to come home to, the toilet was separate from the bathroom (a definite plus for those travelling as a couple). And your room gets made every day. What we really appreciated was the fact that you don't get housemaids knocking at early hours at your door for housekeeping. Since you leave your room keys with them when you leave, they discretely do the cleaning while you are out. That's a BIG plus since we are on vacation mode. We were here for 7 nights and stayed on the top floor, and it was such a cute view of Rue d'Artois. Windows were double insulated, and definitely kept the noise from busy Rue La Boetie outside. Location was FANTASTIC! We were basically just right off of the famous Champs Elysees... and little did we know.... Rue du Fauborg St Honore was right behind us too!!! Also it was literally a hop, skip and a jump to the Metro Station St Philippe Du Roule. We couldn't ask for more in a location. And the best part was, we managed to get everywhere 80% of the time, on FOOT! Service was fantastic! We got to meet the owner.. she didn't speak much English, but was so kind. The receptionists at all shifts were helpful and catered to all of our needs. Our guy was Erick. He was the receptionist / barista, and kept us company till the wee hours of the morning in engaging conversation. Restaurants you definitely need to try, since they're just a stone's throw away from the hotel: Japonais Barbecue ( right next door, Yakiniku was the BOMB!) Crepes Des Champs Elysees (AUTHENTIC French crepes on Rue de Berri) Laduree (for those macaron enthusiasts, and French fare) Also, on Rue La Boetie, there are some really quaint mom and pop shoe stores, Rudy's and Theirry 21 that have affordable and comfortable shoes made in Spain or Italy without blowing your budget.

My sister and I arrived early in the morning, long before check in time, and Reuben locked our suitcases in a secure room until we arrived much later in the afternoon.

We stayed in a deluxe room and certainly were not short of space (we had heard how cosy Paris hotel rooms can be). If this review helps just one more traveller decide to stay here, then we'll be happy enough. If you are on the lookout for a more luxury establishment, you will certainly find many in Paris, but to our minds, \u2026 yous pays your money, yous makes your choice\u2026", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague", "Title": "\u201cFound a great place to stay in Paris\u201d", "Author": "GMGC", "ReviewID": "UR37214594", "Content": "On our way to Charentes we decided to overnight in Paris. we bumped into Hotel des Champs Elysees by coincidence.

The hotel is one block away from the Champs-Elysees nearby the Arc de Triumph. The rooms are beautiful and modern. We had interconnecting rooms which is very handy when you are travelling with kids. Breakfast was also a great way to start the day. Personnel is also very nice and helpful.

The hotel is ideally located, a few minutes walk from both the Champs Elysees and the metro. The very stylish decor makes the room feel warm and inviting as does the hotel. We slept soundly and heard no traffic noise even though our room faced the road. Our superior room with twin beds was cleverly designed, the bathroom superb, a generous sized bath and interesting shower head that worked well. A very sophisticated easily operable lighting system is installed, wifi is free and worked effortlessly. We found every staff member very caring, polite and helpful, they all seemed extremely dedicated.
