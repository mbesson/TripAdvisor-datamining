But this is just what the stairs are like in the older buildings in Amsterdam, so I don't think there's much that can be done about it. Despite being right in the heart of the city centre, the room we had was quiet at night and we all slept well. The beds were fairly comfortable, although with an odd selection of bedding - I had a sheet and a duvet, while another member of the party just had a thick blanket. The bathrooms were clean and tidy whenever we used them. The staff we spoke to were pretty friendly, and the waffles downstairs were great.

When I stayed they had actually removed the banisters to redecorate which made getting up to the room a commerically viable basis for a TV gameshow survivor-challenge. That aside, this is easily the worst hostel I stayed in over the course of a month trip round Europe. It doesn't even look like a legitimate business, their office is in the back of a waffle shop next door - you have to walk past customers eating to reach their reception! You a greeted with 'NO REFUNDS' signs plastered all over the walls, not surprising because I am sure they are asked about it regularly. My belongings were actually nibbled on by mice/rats during my 2 night stay, a suspicion confirmed by the rat traps we found under all the beds in our room. If you smoke you need to be buzzed in and out for a cigarette due to a ridiculous front door system. We always returned to find our bedroom unlocked again, the bathrooms are pretty grim and shared between too many people, the staff obviously hate you, the whole place is disgustingly dirty and badly furnished, it smells awful all the time and unsettling cameras everywhere make you feel very self-conscious. You will not get any sleep whatsoever due to the noise coming from both in- and outside of the hostel - but on the plus side this is because its located in the middle of the red light district (maybe a minus depending on the kind of trip you want). Its not even very cheap, certainly not cheap enough to justify choosing this hostel over any other. If it will cost you \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 more to stay elsewhere just do it.
