We wiped them up the first and third day but they just wouldn't stop coming back. I cant imagine that this isn't something that the cleaning people didn't notice, but they didn't. We had a room on the bay and it was very calm and not very windy so it was nice to sit out and enjoy the sun. One afternoon we had lunch at the bare foot restaurant out side, they had heaters to keep you warm which was nice. I ordered a chicken ceasar salad ($15ish) and it was awful, tasted like instead of making a dressing they just used straight mayo. Sick! My husband ordered a burger which is hard to mess up and he said it was fine nothing special. The other two couples we were there with were also not impressed with the quality of their meals in comparison to the cost. When our bill came, we asked our waiter to split it between the three couples, and he then asked us to total up our own bills and just give him cards to charge. Sorry but isn't that HIS job? Overall for expectation of high quality, fine dining at the resort you would think that they would make sure to hire ONLY the most competent people to assist their guests. That was very clearly not the case. In the gift shop there were people all over the store and a huge line of people to pay for items and only ONE person checking them out.... Since when is standing around your most important job? You are in the service industry. The gentleman who was in charge of the bike rentals was very friendly and helpful and actually seemed to have knowledge about his job. Refreshing. One day we decided to take the water taxi over to sea world which was great, and a fun way to arrive at the park. Only downside to that is that if you want to use the shuttle to come back it only comes back at 5 &6 pm, so you have to be there all day. Which was fine, but it would have been nice to use it to come back earlier. They use Orange Cab to suggest to their customers, but it seemed that they were actually more than other local cabs? not sure, but probably not by too much. I would go back there, but next time I would eat out in town to avoid the poor service and blah food.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vail, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat family getaway!\u201d", "Author": "Beth K", "ReviewID": "UR126784081", "Content": "Our family recently took a winter getaway in San Diego, and Paradise Point was perfect for our needs. It's a little oasis in the city, quiet, peaceful, lush, and beautiful. The rooms are little bungalo duplexes and ours was on a peaceful cove right across from the tennis, basketball and croquet courts. The shop on the grounds is happy to loan you tennis racquets, and putters for the little putting greens that are sprinkled around the property. There is a lovely marina where you can rent sailboats, kayaks, motorboats, or jet skis. We rented a sailboat for a lovely sail around Mission Bay. If you're not an experienced sailor, for a reasonable price you can hire on a captain to give you a lesson, or just have them sail it for you. The pool is large, and warm and very tropical feeling, and there is a lovely lagoon that meanders around the grounds. Our room was clean and spacious and had a small kitchenette with a sink and fridge. They also have fire pits on the beaches. (you can buy firewood at the little store, but it's pricey) There is so much to do in San Diego that it would be hard to do it all in one visit, but Paradise Point is close to everything. It's within a mile or two of Sea World. It's also very close to Mission Beach, and a kitchy old boardwalk amusement park. (can't remember the name right now.)

I have to admit like others after reading some of the negative comments that I was unsure about my choice BUT please remember everybody has different opinions! I have to say I was mesmerized as we drove onto the grounds and found such beauty! We were greeted by Ben who was super!! Diego at the front desk was amazing, great comps, again Thank you!!! When we arrived in our room, which were upgraded to, we opened our patio door the the view and had ducks waiting for us (ok I am a sucker for furry friends.) We also had a very nice card and a basket of fruit waiting for us. We enjoyed our first evening by the pool and hot tub, right outside our room. Again amazing! The next day we grabbed our coffee and scones at the coffee shop and again, staff superb! Headed off for a road trip to Joshua Tree..long drive but beautiful, despite the wind and extremely windy road on the way back, but what and adventure! when we got back to our room we had a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of wine waiting for us, courtesy of our daughter and son in-law! Called the front desk for a cork screw, not realizing one was laying on the table...arrived in 2 minutes! Cannot ask for better service. So if you are ever in the area I would highly recommend Paradise Point. The amenities as super and the staff are just as awesome. Yes there is a resort fee of $17 and there is a parking fee of $32 a day, but have you checked out some other places? Our original plans were to go to Vegas, hmmm, can you say resort fees...I will take these fees and get an awesome stay, great beaches, at a very classy resort!!

Knowing that San Diego was our destination, we started looking around for properties to spend our 5 nights and 6 days. To be honest, we also were a bit apprehensive by the negative remarks made by some reviewers, so we looked for a bit at the Hilton by the Bay, and a couple of others. However, after some discussions, we decided to go with our instinct, realizing that there will ALWAYS be unhappy people out there, quick to nit-pick every last detail, and those whose standards are just ridiculously unattainable. THANK GOD we listened to our inner voice. From the moment we turned the corner on Vacation Drive, we knew we had arrived at our home for a week. Pulling up to the valet, we were greeted by the main man, Marc Garner, who quickly became our SD guru of all things. We cannot say enough amazing things about the staff at PP, from the valet, cleaning crew, grounds keepers, room service, spa staff, bar and restaurant crew, and management. The GM of the property has a kind, compassionate group of extraordinary people working for him, who go out of their way to make the guests at this resort feel as if you are the only people they are there to take care of. But we MUST give extra props to our guy Marc..... He's a gem.... We will certainly come back and he is one of the main reasons why. Our bungalow on the beach was a sweet little apartment, very clean, with a immediate beach access and a fire pit steps away. We ended up meeting some incredible people the first night we were there and met up a few more times throughout the week.... A nice community feel if you're up for that, but no pressure if you're not. The grounds themselves made you feel as though you were on an island of a combination of Tahiti, Figi, and Hawaii. Bikes to ride, mini golf to play, multiple pools to swim in, (including an adults-only pool), spa to relax in, bars on the water to let loose, a phenomenal restaurant to dine at, trails to walk, and beachfront to get lost on. And this is all just on the property. Rent a car if you'd like to get our and explore. Head to the San Diego Zoo and be sure NOT to miss Balboa Park. Go to Ocean Beach, Pacific Beach, Mission Bay, Belmont Park, head down to La Jolla and see the seals, then make a reservation at either George's and have the carrot cake for dessert or stop in at Crabcatcher.

More on that later... We were Priceline customers and they treated us well (not differently as other hotels do). Front desk was friendly- as soon as she started registering us, I asked if it was possible to get a room with a view. They were all sold out but she did give us a room VERY close to the bay! Such a lovely view! The front desk girl told us that she was going to initially put us in a room with a parking lot view- it pays to ASK for a nicer room & they do accommodate so make sure you ask! The room itself- or what it really is, a bungalow- was a decent size. One big room with 2 bed and a separate area for sink and bathroom with tub and toilet. Yes, the room was old and did look dated. No, the beds weren't as comfortable as one would hope (too soft, slightly saggy?). BUT we did only pay $80 a night so absolutely no complaining here. The room was clean and you could tell attempts were made to make it look well-kept. There was a small safe in the \"closet\" area and that's always appreciated. Oh, make sure you bring slippers or flip flops to wear around the place! Even though the weather was warm, the floor was COLD and hard on our feet! The \"amenities\"- we were charged $15 nt for resort amenities (it's since gone up to $17 I believe). We were gone for most of the 3 days were there (to the Zoo, SeaWorld, etc) so didn't get to utilize the amenities as much as we could have. We were close to the main pool and it looked nice. We did get a chance to play mini-golf and that was fun for our 7 yr old (it's just a small course spread out around the resort). I know you could rent bikes but we didn't want to fork over $25/hr. And the spa seemed to offer a lot of interesting services but, again, didn't want to be spending the big bucks on those (they weren't cheap!) Lastly, we did end up getting up room service one evening and it was VERY expensive! We ordered 2 burgers w/ fries and a small pizza for our kid. On top of the food, they charged us $5 for room service + tip (it was either !5% or 20%- can't remember) so I think we paid something ridiculous like $65 for this meal!! Bit pricey IMO. Back to the vehicle point... we didn't rent one and kicked ourselves the whole time we were there! It seemed every one else had one, though. Smart people. The resort is on it's own little \"island\" and there's nothing around. I mean nothing. No pharmacy or fast food joint. Which could be nice if we had a vehicle to jump in and drive to these places. We did walk to SeaWorld- took about 25-30 minutes from our room to the front gate. It's just over the small bridge but it was hot and we were a bit tired by the time we got there. On the way back, we cabbed it because we were tired from walking around all day. Now, cab prices. It cost us about $10 one way from SeaWorld to the resort. Not too bad. But the next day we went to the Zoo and I think it cost us about $25 one way. Rent a vehicle!! Yes, most likely you'd have to pay for the parking at the resort which I hear is like $30 night but the inconvenience of it all... esp if you're bringing kids- not worth it. First you have to call a cab, wait for the cab, pay the cab- on the way back, same deal. We did ask about buses but it was going to take us 3x the time to get where we wanted and it did not appear to be easy at all. With a kid, this would've been a nightmare so we abandoned that idea. If you're going to the resort simply to enjoy the lovely views and all it's amenities, and don't plan on leaving at all, then don't get a car. But if you want to be able to even leave to get a meal outside the resort, I think you'll want to ensure you have a vehicle. Last thoughts... the resort is very peaceful and laid out so nicely. Lovely views, ducks everywhere, little ponds, chairs set out to read by the views, golf cart escorts... really quite quaint and reminds one of another era. We'd never been anywhere like this (in North America) and were a little awed by the size and greenery. Nice place if you want quiet time or a romantic getaway or even to take the kids away for some fun. It seemed it would suit a whole demographic of people. I just don't think I'd pay the \"regular\" prices during high season.

We were cramped by big vans and SUV's on both sides of us, and sometimes it was a challenge getting our baby into the carseat. The rooms were smaller than I expected, and we got a free upgrade to the \"Garden View\", which all that meant to me was you get 2 chairs outside to sit and see your neighbors, but there was no view. We stayed 3 nights and after the first night we noticed tiny ants crawling all over the desk, even though the only food we had was in the fridge. So on the 2nd day we told the FD about it and asked if they would also change the lightbulb outside our door as it was burned out and very dark when we arrived at night. We also wanted housekeeping service this day. But when we got back after a very long day at the Zoo, we found ants still all over the desk, and they didn't change our sheets, just remade the bed.

It looked like the spa was closed too, but I can not verify that. They tried to justify the fees by saying I got the hotel for such a great rate, but if I were interested in paying $116 for a hotel I would have bid that high. I would have even considered this a steal if only the resort fee were levied. For the excessive parking fee of $32 per night (I paid $22 per night at my hotel downtown--where parking is actually at a premium) one of the resorts work trucks parked in my reserved spot during the second day I was there. Luckily I had rented a car, because if not I would have been miserable. The resort is very secluded from any other restaurants, shops, or bars other than the overpriced ones they have onsite ($30 for pasta w/no meat and happy hour priced beer), and as a solo traveler it was not ideal. The actual room was fine. I see a lot of terrible reviews on here about the rooms but I did not experience any issue with bugs or any smell, although I was not in a bay front room. It definitely wasn't luxury, but it was far from a hostel as someone suggested. (Though the towels were awful).

The Paradise Point was what he came up with... boy did he regret it! This place is SUCH a dump! I don't know who rates these hotels, but it was rated as a 5 Star. Well, apparently the Motel 6 has jumped in it's rating as well. If this is a 5 star, then is the Four Seasons a 12 star?? My husband had booked a King room. We have a baby, and luckily I had called ahead to ask about cribs. Well, this \"luxury\" hotel does NOT have cribs, so I brought my own. Thank goodness, because if they did, I can only imagine the condition that it would be in. So when my husband went to check in they told him they \"only had queen rooms available.\" He said, \"I booked a king!\" They said, \"Yeah.. whatever.. we only have queens.\" Disappointed, we headed over to the room. They also charge you a fortune for SELF PARKING right in front of your room. Ridiculous. When we walked in, I could BARELY breathe because it smelled so bad. When I walked into the bathroom, it was covered in mold, and there was a cultured marble counter top, with a plastic toilet and shower. NOT the \"marble\" bathroom pictured and described in the ad. It was so disgusting there was no WAY I would go into that bathroom. And it said \"Walk in closet?\" Perhaps a cockroach could walk in there! Then our room was on the street, as it was advertised as a \"Garden room on a private island.\" Yeah, so private that we could hear the songs people were playing in their cars as they drove by, and their headlights shined into our room. We called and spoke to the manager and demanded to be moved. Meanwhile, I went back out into the car because I couldn't even stand the smell. Suddenly 4 King rooms became available. How did that happen?? So the manager moved us. When we arrived in our new room, it smelled almost as bad, but was so humid I couldn't stand to be in there. Same bad bathroom, and there were dried drips of semen on our brown bed cover. The floor was so dirty I couldn't walk on it, and the bathroom was covered in the same mold, and paint was peeling off of the walls. REALLY?? This is 5 STAR?? I don't think so. It was so disgusting. My husband was mortified because I was so upset and he was trying to do something nice for me. The manager offered to move us again, but I said, \"I'm starving and don't want to waste any more time waiting to be moved to more of the same.\" This had already taken over an hour and a half. They came and cleaned our room to try and make it better. The manager said that he would call us and bring a dehumidifier... he did neither. He did not offer to comp us dinner or anything, only to refund our money and send us back home. After driving 4.5 hours, that wasn't really an option. The grounds are VERY sub par, and when we checked out, the girl seemed totally put out that we received a SLIGHT discount. I couldn't sleep because there was a heater from 1969 that was in the wall and kept turning off and on very loudly. Honestly, the property looks like it was built 50 years ago and hasn't been touched since then. The pools are horrible, and it smells awful.

It was so peaceful and green with ponds, waterfalls, birds, ducks, and herons everywhere. Flowers bloomed all around. The grounds were beautifully maintained. Our room was perfect, a garden bungalow with a view of the bay and a few steps from the beach. There was a large closet/dressing room for hanging clothes and suitcases. The bathroom was a little older but spotless, had two sinks separate from the shower with plenty of towels that were replenished daily. The bed was a bit hard but there were plenty of pillows.There are two restaurants on the premises but The Barefoot Grill was closed for renovation for most of our time there. That created some confusion at Baleen (the main restaurant) as they were picking up the slack. The staff was fantastic at both places (Barefoot opened the outside patio the last two days) and the food was very good except for lunch our first day. Every staff member we encountered was pleasant, helpful, and courteous, from the wait staff to the groundskeepers. We had a massage at the Spa and it was wonderful. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was airport transportation was included in the package. Our decision not to rent a car, in part because there was an additional daily fee to park, worked great for us. When we wanted to leave the resort we called the front desk and a cab was waiting for us in 10 minutes. There are set rates to many of the usual places one would want to visit, e.g. the zoo, the old city. The only criticism that we have is we wished there was a microwave to warm our morning coffee or re-warm left over food and to have better lighting in the bathroom. The bed could have had a little more padding. Next trip we would just walk the grounds and hang out at the pools. You would never know you were right outside a large city.

It was obvious the room had been recently renovated creating a more modern feel with 2 flat screen T.V.'s and a huge bathroom. There was even a small kitchen area with refrigerator and microwave to keep leftovers cold and reheat them in the morning for a nice snack. The bay has several fire pits available to the guests to have your own fire pit to roast marshmallows right on the bay. The private coves are exclusive to the resort guests which makes this portion of the bay very private. The hotel staff are very friendly, we even got a welcome call from the front desk to make sure everything was to our satisfaction.

Just finished my stay at PP with my wife. We stayed for 5 nights in a Junior Bayside Suite. When we first arrived at the Hotel we were greeted by an extremely friendly bellman named Anthony, he goes by Tony though. He loaded our bags for us on his golf cart while we went into the lobby to check-in. Check-in complete, we followed Tony in our rental car to our suite on the bay. He put our bags in our room for us and gave us a tour of our outside space as well as inside of our room. Tony's attitude definitely welcomed us to the more relaxed California lifestyle. The room was very nicely decorated and very clean. I feel bad for the reviewers who wrote a bad review because of a spider or a bug, this has nothing to do with the housekeeping, they are not exterminators. Who doesn't have a spider in their personal residence? Give me a break. Room was very clean. Other vacationers do decide that the chairs behind your room are open to whoever needs them because they are too lazy to carry their own and they did not even have the decentcy to return them, but this is to no discredit for the resort. The reason I titled this review the way I did is because of the few amenities they offer they are all extra charges outside of what you have already paid for your stay. I think for the price you pay to stay there that the parking for your one vehicle should be free. Firewood I also believe should be a free bundle per night per room if you even want to start a fire which not everyone even does. Anything outside of the first free bundle can be charged. Also to bike around the resort for an hour for the two of us was another $25, not too pricey but should still be part of your stay, still keep the time limit, and maybe a penalty fee for a late return, but free for an hour to begin with. There is only two restaurant choices and one of them is more upscale and we both brought vacation clothes, so maybe that is our fault. Our stay was nice overall the surrounding area of the resort is BEAUTIFUL and the area is easy to navigate and the resort is very close to Sea World which is nice. I would also recommend going to Ocean Beach and experiencing a true beach community. The people and the vibe at \"OB\" are very welcoming.

The rooms are really nice and comfortable, the only thing i was disappointed about was the bathtub...i mean for a room this nice and a huge bathroom you cannot have a tiny bath tub ..thats just me...i like big bath tubs ;-) Anyways if you are in San Diego for a few days with your family (especially one with kinds (young or older)) this is the place to stay.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cI was pleasantly surprised.

We were there 3 nights, and the soap was never replaced.

These are the cheap feather kind that are flat as a pancake. Hubby had to take pain meds because his neck was so sore. But the biggest disappointment... We were charged $28 per day for parking and $15 per day for a \"resort pass\" on top of taxes not covered by my Priceline bid. These are non-negotiable so add $45 per night to whatever price you may find online. If you're expecting 4-star rooms like Hyatt, Westin, etc... be warned. This is 3-star quality.

We went to the zoo, seaport village (really neat place-highly recommend), at at Konos for breakfast a few times.. cheap, seat over looking the beach, and great food. Also enjoyed eating at the Fish Shop and Fat Fish grill. We also very much enjoyed Barefoot grill on the resort. Our waitor was awesome. Cute little bridge that connects to the marina..lots of fish and two little sharks on the water. Had breakfast there as well and then rented a paddle boat. We really enjoyed our vacation there. Not sure if I persobally would go there on peak season.. we were able to enjoy anything and everything without a crowd. I did not like the bed.. but my hubby and son didn't complain though.

We were initially pleasantly surprised when we checked in as we were told the room we booked was oversold and we would be getting a complimentary upgrade and in fact it was 2 levels (We booked the Lanai room and ended up with a Lagoon View). The room was pretty out dated. The easy things to upgrade (TV/alarm clock/internet) have been upgraded but the core structure of the room is in great need of attention. The heater/AC wall unit made a large amount of noise making it impractical to use when sleeping, the paint on the bathroom door had peeled in about 50% of the area and they simply repainted it (leaving behind all the markings where the paint had peeled and looking very lazy/tacky). In addition, the walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbors TV prior to going to bed and were again awaken by their TV at 5:45am. The package \"included\" breakfast at their bar. The inclusion is really a $36 credit to your room for breakfast. For 2 people, you can exceed the $36 cap quite easily ordering a plate and juices (we only had coffee which was a little cheaper). So depending on what you order, breakfast is really \"mostly included.\" Finally, the resort charges $28/night for parking. This happened to be included with our package but is astronomical! Not to mention there are plenty of spaces (one space reserved for each room plus a large general parking area). Our room charge for 1 night was $260. We will most definitely choose another location next time we vacation in San Diego as we were sorely disappointed. For that rate, I expect more modern, more private (not hearing the neighbors noise) accommodations. Quite honestly a Hampton Inn or similar would have likely been much better at roughly half the price (breakfast still included).", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn", "Title": "\u201cExcellent resort!

Yes, I tried the menu, and everything else, nothing worked. Every channel was dim and pixelated, but I think this was an issue with the TV service they use.

Once in the lobby you begin to question your choice. I'll start by saying We were 3 adults meeting for a reunion from different parts of the country. When you arrive the front desk service is excellent and accommidating, the lobby has that odor of a classic older hotel without the charm. Our first room was terrible, looked as if it were once a confrence room with funky sliding wall dividers perminantly attached to the wall and a very awkward floor plan, as well it was next to a convention facility and on a court yard that seemed to be grand central for a wedding and a multitude of kids. We asked to be moved to a more private location and were accomidated immediately. The rooms are nothing like the web sight, furnishing are old and a mismash of african looking decor. The sofa sleeper is terrible and any remodeling since the 70's was new floor tile and paint. The grounds are wonderful and if you have a family there are sand beaches, pools and endless amenities to keep kids busy. Be prepared for additional costs, 25$ night to park and 15-25 a night for use of the amenities (not an option) so why not just include it in the price and not look deceptive. Resaurants are nice but expensive and there are boat and watercraft rentals. You will be 15 minutes to everything, old town, gas lamp, seaworld, zoo, airport and downtown. If you are an adult looking for a special experience ask for a bayside view as 80% of the units have a view of a grassy courtyard, small plantless pond or a hedge. The baysides seem great and much more private. Overall, if you are a family looking for a resort experience you will not be disappointed, if you are adults looking for a private getaway it's a toss up, depending on the room you get.

But it all went away once we got there. Beatiful, beautiful resort. I've stayed at Hilton Hawaiian village before and this resort is close in comparison. Easy check in and checkout but make sure you ask for a resort map and direction how to get to your room. The resort is about 44 acres. Easy to get lost if this is your first time. Not only the hotel staffs are nice, but other guests are very friendly as well, maybe since it's so relaxing in this resort. Location is close to major attraction but nicely hidden in its own island. Parking cost $ 28 but there is a free parking spot if you don't mind the walk, depending on where your room is. There are five different pools that I believe are heated but make sure you checked out the main pool that my 2yr daughter loves so much. We stayed in the garden king room that looks exactly like the pictures on their website. Not super luxurious but clean, updated, comfortable and safe. I do have to agree with other reviewers that mentioned about the quality of the towel. It was as smooth as a rug. The other thing that I'm not too crazy about is the use of soap and shampoo dispenser in the bathroom. It might be good for the environment, but I still prefer using those disposable tiny but new soap and shampoo package. Resort fee is $15 that includes the use of their tennis court, basket ball, internet and local call. Restaurant and Market Place item price seems reasonable to us, not over priced like some other resort. We will definitely come back again for a longer period.

We put on are reservation a request for a room with the best view possible for the room we were getting. Paradise point did a great job, we had a bayfront view steps away from the sand. At night we sat on the patio drinking wine and listening to music while watching the beautiful old fashion big paddle boat float in the bay, beautiful scenary especially sunset. The adult pool was great we practically had the jacuzzi to ourselves the whole time. I love that you park very close to your room. Did I mentioned we had just got married and this was our mini honeymoon, well paradise point had a staff member bring complimentary wine with chocolate covered strawberries to our room with such a nice card congratulating us on our marriage, i thought it was so nice of them. I loved that you call for a ride to get around the resort and can call from everywhere from the resturants, the pools, the island store etc. The rooms were very nice as well, we got a junior suite. You dont need to bring shampoo, conditioner or body wash ( unless you prefer a particular brand) because they dont supply you with those tiny bottles most places do, they have decent size refillable bottles in the shower, nice touch. the food was decent too. very nice atmoshere here cons: sooooo expensive!!! the prices are so ridculous, we spent alot and it as just us two and we didnt even do much, cant imagine a whole family.The resturants are extremely expensive $20+ plates, I suggest bringing snacks/drinks and microwavable food so you dont spend so much on food there, the room had a frig and microwave. The bike rentals our expensive as well, we paid for two hours but were tired by 30 minutes lol so returned it at 1 hour, they were very nice and refunded us back 1 hour since we didnt use that hour, with no hassle. Other than pools, bikes and food, not much do to there, but it was relaxing doing nothing for us both. I think the passport to paradise was a waste of money other than pool and parking that was included =/ You have to leave a $100 room deposit, but you dont get it back right away and it takes 5-10 business days after you leave to get it back =(..

Placing our reservations a month in advance, I decided to splurge and reserve the bay view junior suite. We arrive with an exhausted, nap-ready kid at 2PM; we were told that our room was not ready yet, we're given pool keys, and told that we could visit any of the resort's pools while we wait. I ask for our room # so that I we could park and visit the pool closest to our room... we're told that they could not disclose our room #. Huh? Things got worse from there. At 3:30, we were given the go ahead to check in. We picked up our room keys, opened the door, and discovered that we had been given a garden view suite, not the bay view I had reserved. Strike 2. Going to the front desk and requesting a new room at this point is untenable...our child is exhausted...we decide to speak with the front desk the next day. That night, after the boy went to sleep, my wife and I decide to enjoy a glass of wine and some quiet time. We discover that we're not alone...another tenant, a 2 inch long cockroach is sauntering across the floor. This roach was so big, that I could have either smashed him with a shoe or put a leash around him...he does go very well with the three spiders in the ceiling. Strike 3. The roach successfully dispatched, our wine drank, we decide to call it a night...did I mention that we had to go to the store to buy plastic cups to drink our wine because the wet bar in our suite had no cups, no plates, no silverware, nothing? We crawl into bed and discover a blood stain on our duvet. It's not an OJ Simpson sized blood stain, but large enough that the maid should have caught it...we feel the benefit of the doubt slowly shrinking away. Morning. Surprised the coffee maker works, I have my morning cup and climb into the shower. When I get out, I reach for a towel to dry myself only to discover that it is as soft as a roofing tile. Seriously some free beach towels we got at dodger stadium that we use to dry our dog are soft as silk compared with ones. After a big day we return during naptime (1:30 PM) only to discover that the maid hasn't made up our room yet...so, off to the pool we go while we wait for housekeeping. Strike #?? I've lost count. My lovely bride stays with the boy (and her cocktail) at the pool while I visit the front desk to discuss my first day at PP. The guy at the front desk promises the maid will be earlier tomorrow, to report the insect infestation, and that the OJ duvet will be replaced. And the bayview room? He tells me that we got a free UPGRADE from a Bayview Junior Suite to a Garden View Suite. How thoughtful. It would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted this generous upgrade. Day 3. The towels are still exfoliating me, housekeeping had finished by the time we returned from Seaworld, and no signs of any other 6 or 8 leg co-tenants...maybe they're turning this thing around? Fat chance. That night we ordered an early dinner so we would have time to make smores at the fire pit in the main pool area with our son. We arrive at the fire pit at 7:30 PM. No fire. A couple sitting nearby tell us that they have already put in a request to have the fire lit. Not taking any chances I go to the front desk. The woman behind the desk tells me that she'll \"put in a request for the service.\" When I ask her what that means, she tells me that she punches in the request in the computer which will cause someone to show up \"soon.\" Not very reassuring. 7:45 PM. No fire. I return to the front desk. This time there are three parties ahead of me checking in. The woman at the front desk knows why I'm there, but she pretends she doesn't see me to make me wait. When I get to the front of the line, she explains that she doesn't know why the fire hasn't been lit yet. I suggest, impatiently, that perhaps she should pick up the phone and call someone. Her manager beckons me, promises she'll have someone there right away. 8:15 PM. Still no fire. My son is doing his best at waiting patiently for smores. I am no longer patient. So I bring him and his marshmallow laden stick to the front desk. The women there still have no answer for the delay, and seemingly no empathy for my problem. Exasperated, on my way out, I tell them to \"light the damn fire pit.\" The manager behind the front desk threatens to evict me. Unreal. 8:30 PM. We talk with a security guard walking through the main pool area. He gets on his radio. The fire pit is lit within five minutes. Was that so hard? 10:00 PM. We decide to crawl into bed for our final night at the hotel. We pull down the sheets and see the familiar blood stain on the bedspread.

We nearly didn't book here given some of the earlier negative comments (especially regarding cleanliness) but I'm very pleased that we did. We are avid travellers having been to every continent and would say that our experience stood up to standards set by similar luxury resorts around the world. Having clearly also stayed at the same time as some of the negative reviews below (during the power outage) perhaps we were lucky, but I'd like to offer our positive views to provide some balance. Our first impression which lasted throughout our stay, was that this was a luxury resort with beautifully kept grounds, amenities and rooms. We were in a Lanai Garden King room which had a serene private patio overlooking a pond. Although probably towards the bottom of the rooming price range, our room was mopped every day, towels were changed when needed and after leaving a polite request for our housekeeper, extra complimentary coffee was left for us. We were very close to the waterfall pool which suited us as it was very quiet. Although I agree that the main pool did look murky, I don't think it could have been as dirty as alleged in previous emails if it was treated the same as the waterfall pool - the latter was attended to every day at regular intervals by a legion of staff. I do agree that the additional daily parking and the 'passport' resort fee were annoying but this was made clear at booking so we computed it into the cost of the holiday. Unlike many all-inclusive holidays elsewhere there are relatively few activities which are complimentary so be careful as extras can add up. We took out a sailboat from the marina for 4 hours and we didn't feel the charge of $30 per hour was unreasonable. We chose to pay the $28 daily parking fee and keep our hire car as it provided us with freedom to eat out and see San Diego which we preferred. Without this you would be pretty much committed to eating every meal in the hotel and in fact we didn't do so once as there are so many restaurants within a short driving distance. We felt that we did more than offset the parking fee by buying in both breakfast and lunch items from a local supermarket and storing them in our spacious fridge. Contrary to an earlier comment, I was impressed by how the Paradise Point staff dealt with the power outage. Considering there was no electricity at all in California, and parts of Mexico and Arizona, I'm not sure how possibly they could have anticipated an outage of this magnitude or have been entirely prepared for it. Having said that they dealt with the situation admirably by keeping one restaurant open in running a series of gas barbecues and drinks in iced coolers. They managed to keep going until 8.30pm by which time most families with young children had been fed.

The only complaint was that the internet connection was not very good in my room, either wireless or wired. I was not able to use my laptop in my room. I asked about wireless service at the pools, was told it was available but the signal was not strong enough to be useable. I had considered bringing my family to the conference with me but with two toddlers, we decided against this (in part because of not being sure of the condition of the property after reading the reviews). This is a great property for families but probably not for those traveling with babies or toddlers. There are apparently no suites with kitchens which many consider essential when staying in a hotel for several days with very young children. It is a very nice property, any former problems have been corrected and I would stay here again with no hesitation. I would suggest that the management gently reply to all of the negative reviews on Trip Advisor. These reviews are certainly considered when many people are making travel plans.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hull uk", "Title": "\u201ctropical\u201d", "Author": "davidHullUk", "ReviewID": "UR118127949", "Content": "this hotel was lovely didnt know what to expect after reading the bad reviews our room was lovely decorated clean and comfy could have been a bit bigger ,the grounds were lovely it was nice on a night doing the smores at the fire pits i we ate at both restaurants we would stay at this hotel again if in the area all the staff are very helpful and its a good location", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toluca Lake, California", "Title": "\u201cA little slice of Paradise!\u201d", "Author": "Audra P", "ReviewID": "UR118088228", "Content": "LOVED our stay and will be back.

The hotel is in a great location, especially if you are planning on visiting SeaWorld or The San Diego Zoo. Our two rooms unfortunately faced the parking lot which did not provide a very scenic view. We definitely recommend requesting a room that faces either the pool or is on the water. Upon checking in one of the rooms, there was an overwhelming smell of paint in the room, as if the walls had just been painted. We tried to air out the room for a few hours but the smell was too much. We called reception so that we could switch rooms and we were moved to another room about four to five doors away. When we entered our new room, it literally smelled like a wet dog or smelly shoes (not very pleasant). We found the room change frustrating because we were traveling as a group and did not want to be split up from our friends. We ended up staying in the new stinky smelling room after airing it out for two days because we did not want to be moved any further from our group. The other room which our friends were staying in smelled fine, no issues. We also found the resort fee and parking fee a little steep ($15 a day \"Passport to Paradise\" resort fee and $25 a day for parking). We did receive a discount on the parking fee from the reception desk which made it more realistic ($10 a day). The reason why we felt that the resort fee was unnecessary is because we did not end up using any of the \"inclusions\" in this fee. (The fee includes the following activities: Bocce ball, croquet, ping pong, tennis, basketball, the fitness center and Wifi). The activities that we wanted to do, Miniature golf and the surrey ride were not included. The Surrey ride is $35 an hour which allowed all of us to ride together, four adults and two children riding in the basket on the front of the surrey. We really enjoyed the bike ride and would recommend doing it. The kids liked it the most. We also really enjoyed having a bonfire on the beach, on the last night of our stay. You can buy the wood and the items for making Smores in the resort gift shop or if you want a wider selection of snacks for your bonfire you can go to the store (Vons) a short distance away and buy your own items. Moving on to the interior of the rooms... We liked that the rooms had hardwood floors which is generally cleaner than carpeting. Unfortunately, the floors were not swept or cleaned during our stay! We had to literally wash our feet after walking on the floors, every time we walked barefoot in our room.That was both unecessary and quite annoying. The room includes a small refrigerator and coffeemaker. The beds were comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was good. There is a flat screen tv mounted to the wall which offers movie rentals for either $14 or $16 per rental, depending on how new the movie is. We must note that the tv reception was not good in either room. Several channels were quite fuzzy.If we were in our room more often, we would have found some of these issues unacceptable, especially for a hotel of this reputation. As we were rarely in our rooms, we didn't call attention to them. We did enjoy the grounds of the hotel. The landscaping is well done and pretty. The staff that we encountered were professional and nice. Although, we will note that some of the reception staff needs to be better informed of the check in process. Upon first checking in to the hotel, we were told that there would be $100 authorized on our credit cards for any misc. fees for each room (which is standard at hotels and wasn't an issue). Upon checking out of the hotel, my friend's card had the $100 held as previously mentioned but my card had $840 held. Not only was this unexpected, it was also very annoying to have to call the hotel after we had already left, in order to clarify the situation. I spoke with someone at the front desk, who said that the person who had checked us in should have told us that it was $100 authorized per NIGHT, not all together. This did not add up though, as we had stayed five nights, not eight plus and it was an odd amount held on my card, completely different from my friend's charge. Let me note that we didn't have any room charges, such as movie rentals or anything else that would have accounted for any charges. The staff member told me that the charge would come off in a few days. I did not make an issue about it, as the charge came off after about 4 days. It was simply an annoyance for me and a lack of training/communication on the part of the reception staff. All in all, our experience was average here. We would recommend this hotel on the basis of location, as it is so convenient to the beach and SeaWorld. Also, it is a short drive to the airport, Zoo and Old Town. Although,we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, it is not worth the full amount. Look for a package deal if you plan on staying here. *Tips for SeaWorld: We went to SeaWorld twice, using the two day pass that you can buy on the SW website. We really enjoyed the convenience of taking the water taxi from the resort even though it was pricey in comparison to parking at SeaWorld ($46 for four adults and two small children). It takes you to the back entrance of SeaWorld so that you are able to beat the lines and the quick trip over is relaxing. What we would recommend is: if you are visiting SeaWorld more than once: take the water taxi from the resort on the weekends when lines are the longest, park in the SW parking lot during the week when the wait is almost nonexistent (Parking is $14 a day or $19 for premium parking - i.e. Rows 1-6).

The room furnishings were okay, but not outstanding. The pictures on the hotel website make it look a lot nicer than it really is. There were two flat panel HD televisions; however, neither had HD cable, so the TV images were fuzzy. Oh, and there were only 7 or so channels to watch. We stayed at Hilton and Marriott properties later in our vacation, and both had better television images and channel options. We don't watch a ton of TV, but it's a nice option when you're traveling with young children who have early bedtimes. The bathroom was mediocre. It lacked basic amenities, like a towel rack. For $600 a night, I expect to get a room with a towel rack in the bathroom, so that I don't have to lay the towel on the floor while I shower. Gross. The bathroom also just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel very clean. Our room had a microwave and a small fridge, but we weren't provided cutlery, plates, glasses, or even a wine bottle opener. Thus, neither the fridge nor microwave was terribly useful. We ordered room service our first night, and set aside the unused cutlery to eat leftovers with the next day. The \"helpful\" room service took our cutlery when they cleaned the room, leaving us with uneatable leftovers. The pools were fine, but not really warm enough. Honestly, the other two hotels we stayed at during the rest of our vacation had nicer swimming pools and room amenities and were substantially cheaper. I think my biggest gripe about this property is that they don't provide complimentary coffee in their lobby. There's a stand in the lobby to buy coffee, but it costs $4 per cup. But, seriously, when you're charging $600 a night, the least you can do is provide guests with coffee. Yeah, there was a dinky coffee maker in the room, but they only provided enough coffee grounds for about 1.5 cups of coffee. The property is very close to the bayside of the beach, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never dream of getting near the water. It was very muddy close to the shore and smelled vaguely of sewage. The fire pits were fine, but I think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 13 or so pits for the entire property, so families are lined up waiting to use them. I wouldn't stay here again.

It was thirty years ago and the name of the resort was Vacation Village. My mom won two nights in a sales contest and this was one of the fanciest resorts we had ever experienced. My eyes widened as I gazed at the lagoons, tropical flowers and cabana-style one-story cottages. Located on 44-acres, the tropical island, situated on Mission Bay was filled with families riding bikes, building sand castles and swimming in the pools. I excitedly bounded out of the car and walked over to the lagoon filled with ducks and admired the observation tower. Many years later Princess Cruise Lines purchased the property when the popular television show, THE LOVE BOAT was one of the most watched television shows in America. Princess was going to sail to Mexican ports from the port of San Diego and package cruise and land vacations. Guests could cruise on their ships and stay overnight before or after the cruise at their resort. I never stayed at the San Diego Princess Resort, however in 1998, the resort was purchased by LaSalle Hotel Properties and one of San Diego\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top vacation destinations was renamed Paradise Pointe. Since then, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been returning throughout the years. With one-mile of beachfront and 462 spacious rooms, the resort hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed that much since my first visit. The decoration is more Balinese then I remember from the past. There are the Lanai Garden rooms with your choice of a King-size bed with a sleeper sofa or two Queen size beds. The semi private patio has two Adirondack chairs for reading a good book or sitting outside and enjoying a pre-dinner cocktail. The Garden Suites offer larger patios, walk-in closets and dining area with a wet bar. The Lanai Bay side offers nice views of Mission Bay and are situated near blazing fire pits for evening s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mores. The Bayside Junior Suite Premium Lanai Suites offer more square footage, greater views and more amenities. One feels as if they are in Hawaii walking around the lush grounds. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the fanciest resort in San Diego and you will notice deferred maintenance, yet its fun for all ages. There are five pools sprinkled around the grounds. All the pools have been updated and the main pool near the lobby has a sandy beach. The family lagoon pool has a hot spa, as does the quieter adult lagoon pool. There is also a meadow and waterfall pool. The tennis/basketball/croquet and ping pong area are underused, however guests seem to enjoy renting Surrey bicycles and playing on the golf putting course. There are two excellent dining options. The Barefoot Bar and Grill is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner offering glorious views of the sailboats, kayaks and paddle boarders on Mission Bay. For dinner, the elegant Baleen Restaurant was my choice for a birthday celebration. Even though the night air can be chilly, the restaurant has outdoor heaters to keep guests comfortable while sitting on the patio overlooking the lights of Mission Bay. Paradise Pointe is a successful wedding spot with at least three weddings going strong during our one night visit over Labor Day weekend. Guests wanting to spend a day at Sea World can leave their car at their designated parking spot and hop on the Sea World Water Taxi at the dock. The 15-minute cruise will take guests right to the exclusive back gate.

We have previously stayed here twice before and it is one of our favourite places to visit. We are always a bit wary of going back to places we've loved before, in case they've changed (for the worse) since our previous trip. However, aside from a couple of minor niggles, we had another great stay here. The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we love the resort feel. The location is very handy for all the San Diego attractions, and whilst you do need a car to get around, you can tell this from the location when booking. San Diego is also much nicer and easier to drive around than LA (for us Brits at least!) The rooms had been renovated since our last trip in 2007 and whilst the comments about the dusty floors did have some validity, overall we were very pleased with the standard of accommodation - after all, you're walking about in flip flops/sandals or barefoot, so you're bound to bring in a certain level of dust and dirt. We were given 'adjoining' rooms which basically meant that we had a bungalow to ourselves which was an ideal set up. The beds were huge - and high! Having fridges in both rooms and a microwave in one was also really handy. We loved being able to sit out on our patio and have breakfast overlooking the pond. It's a shame that they've changed the toiletries, as the old ones were lovely, although they've obviously wised up to everyone taking them home! The new ones are still really good though. We never had a problem getting sunbeds by the main pool, even if arriving in the afternoon after going out for the morning. Part of our Virgin package meant that we got free parking (always appreciated - especially when it's right outside the room), didn't have to pay the 'Passport to Paradise' fee and got $25 per room, per night resort credit - which equated to $350! It seems ironic that they are trying to introduce the mandatory 'passport' fee, but none of the staff around the resort seemed to know what to do with the slips of paper for mini golf, bike hire, etc. We were however able to enjoy two meals at the Barefoot Grill (including two free desserts for one meal) and two lunches by the pool with our resort credit and still had some leftover to treat ourselves with in the gift shop! The food at the Barefoot was delicious as usual, although we were slightly disappointed to see the menu had changed - we loved their Philly cheesesteaks and pulled pork!

However, Paradise Point offers a family vacation experience; with activities and tastes for all ages! For example: > Dive-in movie night: The kids splish, splash and see a favorite showing, while most parents, lounge poolside over catch-ups & cocktails. > Bonfires on the Beach: S'more's by the sea allows for nightly quality \"family time\" to connect over silly stories or games, in an unplugged beach setting. > Bungalows-All very comfortable with modern decor, updated amenities, and a \"front porch\" sitting area, on/or near the bay. > Food-Most resorts dumb-down their menu's to offer kid-fare; however, the meal options at Paradise Point, are more mature to satisfy adults, but still hold the interest of children. They do offer some of the typical, cheeseburger/chicken nugget staples, but also include more healthful fish, fruit and pasta options. **And, the outdoor restaurant on the bay is surrounded by streams of Koi and other sea life; which allows adults time to enjoy their own meals with a relaxing, almost tropical water view, while the kids are captivated in their surroundings. My nephews complained when we had to leave lunch, because they were having so much fun watching crabs crawl in the rocks and the sea birds steal fries from nearby vacant tables. > Grounds-The resort is not a Four Season's/Ritz caliber, however, there has been thought put into making the grounds feel like a get-away location. There are exotic florals/landscapes, \"wild\" marine life (ducks/birds/fish, etc.) roaming the property, and a quiet, serene feel throughout. > Activities-There are numerous on-site options such as boat/jet ski/paddlebike rentals, games, 3 pools (including an adult-only option) and beach sports. As well, SEA WORLD is a mile away, which is a fun alternative-especially, with the summer promotion of 2-day passes, which allows a more leisurely experience of the park. **There are a series of lagoons/lakes connected through the resort which are stocked with ducks and fish; armed with a box of crackers and left-over breakfast toast, my nephews and I spent 2 hours hand-feeding the critters and taking pictures. The ducks even started following us through the resort and the boys were thrilled with their new-found friends! *****Note: feed the ducks open handed, or you might get a slight nip. I have stayed at several kiddy hotels and always leave with either a headache, toothache, or purse-ache from all of the saccharine, screaming & spending!

We enjoyed the chairs on our patio overlooking one of the lagoons--we brought a couple of bottle of wine and were able to chill it in the in-room fridge. There are NO luxuries (some would say, no basics even)...no robe, not water bottles, no turn-down service, no hair dryer, only 2 glasses and 4 paper cups for coffee. In fact, we returned to our room at 5pm one day and it STILL had not had maid service--we called and it was close to 6pm when she came. Not happy about that. But, on the whole, the room was clean and pleasant. They still have the ancient in-wall A/C which needs updating. There was also bits of trash around the entrance of our room--it is these small details which completely keeps the place from truly being a resort. BUT, the Barefoot and Baleen Restaurants are excellent--really good food, nice ambiance, generous portions. Room service was fast and delicious. My child cried when it was time to leave because we did not have enough time to do all that there is to do (we missed the movie at night over the pool, the bike rides, fire pits on the beach).

My experience is near on identical with many of the previously posted bad reviews. The grounds are indeed quite impressive - from a distance.

There was electrical equipment lying arund everywhere. A hazard for small children - and my inquisitive son. But the rooms - they have been refurbished? That's the biggest joke. They are sooo small and the bathrooms are absolutely disgusting. Decor could have been quite pleasing, but most of the furniture was broken. The worst thing about this resort - I will have to repeat - is the cleaning! It started upon arrival: beer and coke cans directly next to the patio. Dust and undefined dirt under the bed. This however carried on and I had to complain twice about the cleaning. Reception did not seem in the least interested and it hardly got better. We had no hand soap in the bathroom, I had to wipe out the drawers before putting some clothes in. Mostly we ate breakfast outside the property, but before going to seaworld we tried out the breakfast at the resort. Good that was horrible and exceedingly expensive. But finally there is the safety issue. We hired one of their bikes to go around the property with our son. We realized that our bungalow was probably even in one of the better locations. Some bungalows border directly onto a public park with large car park and are literally situated next to the public toilets. No walls, bushes, fences or even guards to protect the property from trespassers or whatever. The bike ride for me was horrifying, knowing that anyone could reach our bungalow by beach access. This was particularly disturbing because at night we had to sleep with the patio door open, as there were no other windows. After that I could hardly sleep at night....

I can not say enough about this place, and with all that they have done for us, and how we were treated both times, this is my FAVORITE place to stay in San Diego, and should not be missed. We are going back in September. My only mistake in June was not going with Paradise Point to begin with. Don't second guess this place.

When we called for service everything was taken care of right away, however, we felt that for the price we shouldn't have had to deal with all those issues. The resort was isolated and because we did not have a car it was an issue to get anywhere. Thus, we were inclined to eat there more and buy items from the gift shop, which was pricey. The floor in our room was very dirty, as someone else has stated. The first night I walked around the room in my socks and the bottoms were black after 2 hours of walking on the room floor. It was quite a walk to get anywhere on the resort, so if you have trouble walking this would not be the place for you. Overall, it was a very pretty place and generally the staff was exceptional.

I was somewhat curious about the location since it was merely 10-15 minutes from the airport and didn't seem anything like the \"paradise\" promised on the website. We turned into the resort after traveling through a less than desirable looking part of the city and the scenery completely changed. The lush grounds opened up and we ended up in the middle of a different atmosphere. We were immediately greeted by one of the staff (Mark) and it was perhaps one of the best client service experiences I've ever had. From beginning to end he helped us unload, drove our car to our bungelow, made sure we were always taken care of. Big plus in my book. We had a series of bungalows that connected and sat alongside the \"beach\". Don't expect this to be the type of beach you see in other parts of San Diego, it doesn't appear to be made for swimming like beaches along the coast. It is located on the bay and the waters are calm and good for wading. Certainly an awesome view from our rooms though! Every morning we made sure to close our doors or the inhabitants would make their way into our rooms...so please, if you don't want ducks, geese and other wildlife in your room, keep your doors shut tight! We took advantage of the delivered s'mores kits and beach fire pits. Word of advice, these pits are first come first serve and most people tend to set up in the early AM and leave their things there all day which limits how many can enjoy the pits. We found that sharing with other families or couples would ensure at least some time at the pits. Rooms are spacious and decorated beautifully and all of our rooms had kitchenettes and living rooms. You can tell there have been major renovations and/or updates because the paint on the walls seems a little worn and repainted with several coats. Due to the style of the bungalow rooms, there doesn't appear to be central AC, units are featured in each room and it got a little stuffy during the day but nothing that couldn't be easily remedied. The grounds are amazing and makes for good walking after dinner or activities. The onsite dining options are varied. We ate at the casual restaurant Baleen's; service was so so, food was ok, drinks were good! During our stay, Prom was being held in one of the Ballrooms and they were having a blast!

After all of us were very disappointed we couldn't go to Mexico, we went home and I immediately checked online to see where we could fly out to that same day.

I think this resort does a good job servicing everyone. We had dinner once at Baleen, the food was very good, a little slow getting out, but a beautiful view, and a little pricey. We ate lunch & breakfast each at Barefoot Bar & Grille, the food is very good, however, the food is VERY slow getting out. Each time we had to wait over an hour for food, keep this in mind if you have small children or if you're in a hurry. We also ordered room service several times, this is also slow. The location of the resort is perfect, you are literally across the bridge from Sea World and about 10-15 minutes from the airport and Gaslamp District. You can actually see the fireworks from Paradise Point. They offer a ferry from Paradise Point to Sea World, this is really nice since you get to come in the back way, no lines. Although, the last ferry leaves at 7 pm which is unfortunate. I believe the fee is $9 round trip. If you are concerned about staying at Paradise Point don't be. I read some of the negative reviews and was a little concerned. It's a beautiful resort, that has been completely remodeled. It is well appointed, relaxing, and the service is excellent. My only complaint is the wait for food. We travel frequently, and like to stay at nice resorts typically 4-5 star. I would give this resort 4 1/2 stars.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGood property letdown by underwhelming service and overwhelming cost\u201d", "Author": "Traveller32Sydney", "ReviewID": "UR115746204", "Content": "We were one of three families meeting at Paradise Point.

The property itself has a wonderful curb appeal, and it does look like a tropical paradise, as long as you don't look at the area around the bungalows too closely. (the rooms are set in bungalows as opposed to a central hotel tower or building) This was our one family vacation for the year (we have 3 children - a 14 year old, a 12 year old and a 3 year old), and we arrived on July 3rd for a 5 night stay only to find that they wouldn't be able to check us in - the computers were down. They weren't keeping a list of who had arrived and was waiting to be checked in, so it was up to us to sit there in the lobby and wait until they were ready to check in again. They told my husband that we could go to the pool - as if that would somehow make us go away happy - but if we'd done that, there would have been no way to know that the computers were back up. Silly and a sign of poor management. As we were waiting - I was sitting in the car answering some email, and our car was hit by a bicyclist. We were parked, so yes - the bike hit us. I jumped up because the noise was really loud - and I saw someone riding away. So I got out of the car and proceeded to ask the person riding if there was damage - because he hit pretty hard. Well, I didn't see that a child was down on the ground beside our car (I was on the passenger side and this was on the drivers side). I felt horrible because my goodness, it was a child - and I have 3 of my own! As it turned out, the child was fine thank goodness - but the Bellman who had heard my initial reaction saw it fit to be extremely rude to me in the process. I didn't need that after having already been waiting for over an hour for their precious computer system to be up and running. Then another bellman passed by our car and I overheard him saying to another guest that the computers had already been down for a couple hours, that it happens all the time, and that he'd be surprised if people would be able to check in by morning. Seriously?!? Finally, two and a half hours later, the computers started working - but oddly - NO one working the front desk announced this to the people waiting. You had to go up to them and ask. By this time, my husband and I were very upset, and our children - including our three year old - were starving. As a way to appease us, the manager offered to comp our parking and cut our room rate in half the first night, which was very nice...if the room had actually been worth even the CUT rate. By this time, it was dark and yes - the tiki torches are a nice touch, and it did remind me of Hawaii. We get to our room, and the keys don't work. Annoying. We go back to the lobby - by car because the property is very spread out - get new keys, come back to the room, and they don't work again. At this point, I'm furious. My husband calls the lobby from his phone, explains the situation and they say they're going to send a bellman with new keys and he'll stay to make sure they work. 15 minutes later - we're still standing outside. Finally a security guy drives by in an electric car by chance, and he lets us into the room. About 5 minutes later a bellman shows up with new keys and presto - these work. As far as the room goes, it's nothing special, although it's a decent size. Two queen beds, a dry-bar area, a small table, a large dresser or credenza thing - a wall closet, small sink area outside the toilet and shower area - which had water damage on the walls that they'd tried to cover up with paint. Oh, no door to the sink area - just a slider door (that didn't work well) to the shower/toilet area, which also had mildew damage. Oh...and no carpet at all. Just a tile floor that was supposed to look like wood - and let me tell you, it was FILTHY. We'd shower, walk on the floor barefoot and our feet would be black afterward. We wore shoes the entire time, only to take them off when we'd get into bed. Gross. My husband was set that we were staying no matter what at this point, so we unhappily got dinner and got ourselves into bed for the night. The next day we got up and hoped for the best - we were planning to spend the day at the large family pool in the middle of the property, and I have to say - it was the one redeeming quality of this entire resort. We did eat breakfast at the Barefoot Bar, which truly needs to expand it's menu and include LUNCH type items that aren't $26.00. I don't even mind paying the money as much as I mind the lack of choices. There's one other true restaurant on the property called Baleen - we never ate there because they weren't able to accommodate us any time we requested a table. The afternoon was spent at the pool, which is also where we received our best service for the entire trip. The food was good, the drinks were good but of course resort-pricey, and the pool was a lot of fun for the kids. We headed back to our room about 3:30 to get ready for dinner, but lo and behold the housekeeping service never made it to our room. We decided to just get ready for dinner and call as we were leaving our room, which we did. After finding out that Baleen refuses to seat people unless you already have a reservation (and by the way - the restaurant was completely EMPTY when we arrived) - we ate at Barefoot Bar again. The food was so-so for dinner, but we made the best of it. Got back to the room after fireworks - 9:45ish - and once again, the room wasn't cleaned. We called yet again, and finally someone arrived to clean our room as my three year old was sleeping on my shoulder as I waited outside. It seemed to take quite a while - so we went around the backside of the bungalow to wait. Turns out, our housekeeper was taking a little TV break. We could see her watching The Bachelorette through our slider window!! As soon as she saw my kids looking at her, she closed our drapes, and we walked back to the front door to wait. As she walks out she tells us that she just washed the floor - so it was wet. This also gave us the opportunity to be able to see just exactly where she washed the floor - and let me tell you - she literally made one swipe past the beds, through to the bathroom, and that's about it. Disgusting. Next morning we get up, go about our day - come back to the hotel at about 7:30, and no, the room still wasn't cleaned. This time, when housekeeping arrives, we start asking questions - come to find out, they won't clean your room unless you specifically request it, or put a sign out that requests service. I've stayed in many resorts - never once have I had to ASK for housekeeping service. While the room was being cleaned, we decided to go to the pool near our room to swim. We get there to see that although there ARE lights in the pool and spa, they aren't turned on. That's a dangerous situation if I've ever seen one at night. It's not well-lit, and if someone like my three year old fell in and went to the bottom, we might not have seen her. We didn't stay long, just long enough to see a few people come, coolers in tow - to sit in the spa and drink beer. They were clearly drunk, and while I have no problem with people drinking, they were slurring their words and I wasn't comfortable with the kids there. I could go on and on. I should have realized when we booked that it was odd that there didn't seem to be a limit as to how many people you could have in your room. It was very clear that this was the type of place you come to party it up with as many people as you can pack in - and it's not high class - definitely not worth the $300+ per night tab they wanted for each room. Thanks Paradise Point - trust me when I say I'll be making sure to tell everyone I know about your \"fantastic\" service. Friends don't let friends (or strangers for that matter) stay here.

So I am writing this review so you may know the real dealings behind Paradise Point so more formative information can be conveyed to your clients. The only Paradise in this place is to the owners and stock holders. There is nothing free in this place and if you do decide to eat, lounge or use there facilities it will cost-not just a fair amount but they gouge you. A smoothie at the pool restaurant is $6 served in a small cup, bike rental for one hour is $25 and to play putt-putt in their make shift little course was $10 a person. I have stayed at many resorts and I don't mind paying a reasonable amount to play but that was ridiculous for what you got. Now let me tell you about the room, the room was very small and the bathroom was made at an angle which shortened one side. It was also connected to an adjoining room, you could hear everything that was going on in the other room-not very restful. The refrigerator barely worked and if you wanted a microwave it was an additional $25 a day. They tell you at check-in that you have this so-called passport which offers many free services compared to other resorts-its bogus. Once you check out, a hidden charge of $15 dollars is added to your bill for each day of your stay whether you used them or not. They also charge $25 dollars a day for parking which I new about but that is crap-there is parking every where available, just another means to rip you off. Now let me tell you about the service. My son and his girlfriend ordered a grill cheese and tomato soup entree from the Bare-Foot restaurant (it was a little cold outside) and it took a hour to receive their food, then instead of soup they gave him a cup of marinara sauce (spaghetti sauce). I questioned the waiter and he just blew me off like I didn't matter. The whole 5 day stay that I was there the pool was never cleaned. When I arrived, the bottom of the pool was covered with dirt and during our stay, it only got worse. Paradise Point is a big resort; however it only has 4 washing machine to accommodate hundreds of families-they are not even centrally located. they were located way on the other side of the resort and the only way to get there was by foot unless you were staying in that section. I was in San Diego for 9 days, I stayed at the Holiday in Express and the Sheraton by the Harbor. I got way more for my money- which by the way was half the price- at both these places. Free internet, refrigator, microwave, breakfast. The sheraton even had activities for the kids to do-we loved movies every night by the pool. The food at the Sheraton was reasonably priced with good portions. One last thing, I charged a plain coffee to my room one morning. it cost $4 and some change. When I checked out, I questioned a charge on my bill, they said some one charged $43 to my room from a coffee cart or something. They were accusing my kids of doing it. I assured them they didn't and I wanted to see the receipt. It took awhile but they found the receipt, they charged my room $43 for my regular coffee.

However I noticed so many details that were missing that I imagine a more discriminating customer would rant about them it a heartbeat. My wife and I went there for a romantic weekend getaway. We arrived late, around 10:30p; front desk girl was very pleasant and fast to check us in, driving to our room the driveway was very dark, it looked like the campground in a horror movie. My wife and I were hungry so we call room service and were disapointed to find out it ends at 10pm, the person gave me the phone number of a place that delivers pizza late. Not a great dinner to start our weekend. I have read about the cleanliness problems in your rooms so the next morning I went into the bathroom first and was able to confirm there were hairs left from a previous guest to that room, I cleaned them before my wife could see them (she is picky). also I noticed several dents in the wall's paint that made the place look like it was very old and poorly maintained. We had planned to go out to san diego but after walking around to see the grounds the pools were so inviting that we decided to stay the whole day by the pool and then walking by the beach. It was beautiful. We also met our next door neighbors, a family with 4 kids, my wife and I were kind of embarrazed because we had been kind of loud the previous night and the bed's headboard is not mounted to the wall so it sounds like a drum against the thin walls. Hotel manager, please nail the headboards to the walls In the end I would recommend this hotel for a family vacation with the kids or with friends. I would not recommend for a romantic weekend (unless you're 60). I would also not recommend to people that I know as very picky or cleaniless obsesive.

The grounds are beautifully landscaped, with tropical flowers and blooming trees everywhere; kids will enjoy feeding the ducks and fish that populate the ponds and streams throughout the property, and there are bikes as well as 2-person and 4-person covered surreys available for leisurely pedaling. The resort is located on an island in the middle of Mission Bay, fringed by a beautiful mile-long sandy beach and calm waters perfect for small children to play and swim in. Mission Beach is located a 10-minute drive west for those who want wave action. Sailboats, jet skis, and kayaks are available on site for rental, and a 15-minute water taxi ride will take visitors to Sea World, circumventing the need for parking and waiting in long lines to purchase tickets (tickets for the park as well as for Legoland, the San Diego Zoo, and the Old Place Trolley can all be bought at the centrally located resort shop adjacent to a small mini-golf course). The fitness room is well-equipped with a couple of treadmills, exercise bikes, ellipitical trainers, free weights, and 8-10 weight machines; we didn't try the spa, so can't comment on that. There are five pools on the property, ranging from small and shallow for the kiddies to a large and occasionally somewhat crowded main pool adjacent to the lobby, resort shop, and fitness center / spa. Staff were uniformly friendly and very responsive to our requests throughout our stay. The Bareback Grill has excellent food, a nice view with indoor and outdoor seating, and an entertaining but occasionally somewhat annoying resident egret (?) named Harold who'll definitely make a go for your lunch if you turn your back once too often. Ask the staff for the Tabasco water sprayer if you plan on sitting near the edge of the patio dining area (!). About the only (slight) negative was that our room appeared darker than the online photos and could have used some updating. Nevertheless, I'd hasten to add that it was clean, the decor tasteful, and the beds comfortable. We were hoping to book a suite with kitchen facilities, but weren't in time to manage that; our room had a microwave and refrigerator, though, which enabled us to prepare simple meals from time to time to keep down costs. Keep in mind that parking is $25 extra per day - not sure why the resort does this, since most guests seem to have cars, but so it is. There's also a $15 extra per day resort fee, necessary to access the fitness center as well as certain other things which I can't remember, but this doesn't seem unreasonable. All in all, a very restful place to stay, with lots to do for the kids and memorably beautiful grounds / plantings.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Draper, Utah", "Title": "\u201cFun place to stay, nice room with beautiful views.\u201d", "Author": "kcat24", "ReviewID": "UR114993329", "Content": "We stayed here for half our our honeymoon and were very pleased.

The swimming pools and hot tubs were great. However, they did charge a $15 a day fee for a bunch of stuff that we had no interest in using. Also, there is a hefty nightly parking fee as well. If our fee hadnt been waived, we would have been charged an extra $25 a night. Those start to add up quite a bit. So be prepared to pay an bunch of extra when you check out.

This left us with a good initial impression of the resort. The young man who showed us to our room was also very friendly, and extended himself as a resource during our stay. We were quite impressed with the aesthetics and location of the room, as it sat facing bay with two Adirondack style chairs on the linai. There was a small private beach with fire pits, and while we didn't use them, we did benefit from the smells of the fire enjoyed by the other guests. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The food was above average, as well as the service. The only aspect that we could offer some constructive criticism towards is that there seems to be some lacking in the attention to detail. For example, doors were difficult to open, fireplace in room had very low flames, beer can left on linai from previous guests filled with ashes and cigarette butts, somewhat non-thorough room cleaning. We only say this, because we feel this place has too much potential for these kind of things to be overlooked. We really thought the staff and grounds were wonderful overall.

You forget that you are in a city as soon as you pass the entrance. The lush landscape, the GORGEOUS ponds and sitting areas all add to an amazing tropical experience. We had coffee every morning by the ponds while the kids fed the ducks. We rode bikes (which you can bring and store in your patio or rent). Heated pools were a blast and food was ok there, we also brought our own sandwiches in and they did not care. After a day in the pool, nothing beats a round of croquet, ping pong and mini gold with the kids. Before heading to barefoot grill and NOTHING will beat the view there. Live Band Friday Night while watching the sunset over the water was gorgeous. How do you end this night? how about a bonfire and smores. A family from Canada had a fire going already and even though there were open pits, they invited us to join them and we had a blast... Wake up the next day and do it again!!!

When we walked to the island market or by one of the swimming pools, we noticed a lot of people, but the way the bungalows are laid out on the property, it makes you feel somewhat private and isolated, which we liked. We had a garden room which is not along the beachfront, but the beach was just a short walk away. Our room did have a lagoon off our patio, with a cute family of ducks that came by several times a day to see if we happened to have treats for them, which we had purchased at the island market! The view from our patio was peaceful and beautiful. We ate twice at the Barefoot Bar & Grill; the service and food was wonderful! The gentleman at the Coffee Bar was great also! We called the concierge for tourist advice several times, and they were very helpful. The bell staff was informative and welcoming, especially Fernando, who greeted us every morning with a warm hello when we arrived at the main resort area. Everyone working at Paradise Point appears to LOVE their job! The only negative feeling we had was regarding transportation. We were wishing the resort had a shuttle service to transport guests to the downtown area at least, because we ended up spending a lot of money on taxi service. We attempted to take the local city transportation system with a $5 per day pass. The price was right, but it took us 90 minutes of bus and trolley riding to get to the zoo. The city bus driver was less than helpful and not very friendly. We ended up walking around the transit station for a while until we found a transit official who offered us a map and further information. This does not reflect poorly on the resort, but made us wish Paradise Point offered a shuttle service.

Having never been to the area, we chose Paradise Point because it looked cozy and seemed like a safe bet for a nice room and facilities. Plus, we were traveling over Memorial Day weekend, and I'd heard the beach areas got very busy. The private beaches and marina seemed promising. Our room was a regular garden view with king bed. It was nice enough, but nothing extraordinary. There was a coffee pot, a safe and a small, dorm-sized fridge, which we didn't discover until our last day because it was designed to look like a door on the desk. Had we actually used the fridge, it would have been nice to have a microwave available, but there was not one. The best part of our stay, hands down, was the room service. We ordered breakfast every morning, and I was skeptical about the prices being a good value...but they were. Everything we order was delicious, they were quickly delivered, and the portions were huge. Two of the days, we didn't even eat again until dinner because we were so full. The main pool was heated, but not the smaller pools in each grouping of rooms. The weather was uncooperative that weekend, so the unheated pools were out of the question. There was plenty of room in the main pool, but we didn't swim because it was where everyone had headed and we were looking for something more private without children splashing about (ours were staying with grandma). We visited the onsite store (The Island Market) several times. It was well stocked with snacks, souvenirs, and trinkets. They were priced as you would expect at a resort. The Barefoot Bar and Grill was a nice place to hang out if you are staying on the resort, but in retrospect, I'm sorry we wasted a meal there when there are so many choices in town. We walked past the marina, but it seemed to be mostly small boats and a couple of jet skis. We were more interesting in snorkeling and parasailing, so we ended up going to the public beaches anyway. About the only thing we did on the resort was renting bikes one day (I think they were about $20/per hour for each bike). The resort website is deceptive in this area because they provide a very detailed map of Mission Bay bike paths, but when you fill out the rental contract, there is a section which states you can't take the bikes off their property. It was okay, but you can only do so many laps around the parking lots. I would have enjoyed it much more if we'd been able to go cruise along the beaches just across the street. If I could do this over, I would walk over to the beach and look for a bike rental off-property or bring our own. In hindsight, I probably wouldn't stay here again. Our total bill for 2 people for 3 nights was just over $1,000. That included our three breakfasts, 2 in-room movies, $25 parking per day, and a resort fee (maybe $15 per day?). Considering that there were so many fun things to do in the San Diego area, we didn't spend $1,000 worth of time here. What little we did do (eating and bikes) was extra anyway. Next time we come to San Diego, I will have a better idea of the \"nice\" areas and the areas I wish to avoid and will just book a regular hotel with a year-round indoor pool!

After 6 hours on airplanes, we arrived at the hotel just ahead of the 4pm check-in time. The front desk told us their computer systems were down, and they were unable to accommodate us. They did not offer to hold our luggage or invite us to relax by the pool; it was \"Sorry, come back later!\" When we returned after 4pm, there were lines of frustrated guests in the lobby waiting to check in - plenty of people were as unimpressed as we were. Previous reviews are correct about the outrageous parking fee - it is $25 per night. This would be reasonable if Paradise Point was within walking distance to anything in San Diego and we could leave the car behind, but it's not. The hotel is set back quite a distance from downtown or the beaches. The fee was a surprise to us. We had booked the hotel through Orbitz and thought we were paid in full, so we weren't happy. There is also abundant parking - every room has an assigned spot, there's a large general parking area, and a large parking lot for the banquet hall. Parking's not at a premium so it just felt like a big rip-off. Speaking of ridiculous fees, this hotel charges for EVERYTHING. Internet has a fee. LOCAL telephone calls are $1 for the first 30 minutes, and $0.10/minute after that. Fitness center is $12/day (but it's free if you spend $75 in the spa!). It even costs money to play basketball. We joked that we wouldn't turn on the TV because they probably charged for basic cable. To add insult to injury, the room is stingy with extras. We had no soap in the bathroom, no lotion, no water bottles, and no robes. Housekeeping didn't show up until 5:30pm on our last full day (and didn't collect our neighbors' dirty room service dishes for 2 full days. Gross.) The most deceptive fee of all is the daily resort fee of $15 per day. Upon check in, you receive a \"passport\" that says for $15/day, guests receive internet, free use of the fitness center, free outdoor games, free local phone calls, and a few extras. It's worded to make you believe that you need to ASK for this bundle, so my husband and I purposely avoided all of those things to avoid the fee. We had already paid for the room once and were annoyed by the secret parking fee, so imagine our surprise when our check-out statement had the $15/day fee, for an extra $90. When my husband went to the front desk to complain, the girl admitted that lots of guests were surprised by the extra $40/day (parking + resort fee), but there was nothing she could do. In all fairness, the hotel is very pretty and well-manicured. The pools and spas are nice, Barefoot Bar & Grill is a decent place to eat, and the beds were very comfortable.

Very lush and tropical. The hotel is secluded, the closest area is Sea World., which makes it nice for families. One of the first things you notice, besides all the flowers and trees is the people riding \"surries\" or bikes thru the property. Then you see people playing miniature golf on a small course that is along the side of the entrance road. No windmills or water hazards, just little putting greens connected like links of a regular golf course. Next to the lobby is a lovely large lagoon with waterlilys and plenty of fish and water fowl. The lobby is a little dated, but according to the front desk staff, will be renovated sometime soon. Next to the lobby is a market and gift shop that has lots of cool things to tempt you. The bike/Surrey rental area is right next door. The fine dining restaurant, Baleen is a short walk from the lobby and the prices are not too bad. The most expensive is the Steak and Lobster at over $50.00. Not too far from their is the waterside restaurant that is open all day. Not a huge selection but the 4 cheese grilled cheese with Tomato Basil soup combo is excellent. Be aware of the heron's, they like to snatch food off your plates. Didn't see this first hand, but was advise to watch out for this one sneaky bird who liked to surprise you and make off with part of your meal. The rooms are 1950's bungalows that have been updated inside. Very Hawaiian themed with cheery bright yellow walls. There are refrigerators in the rooms, which makes it nice to keep your leftovers or a bottle of wine. The coffee makers are the type that use the coffee pods and make either one or two cups at a time. The beds were incredibly comfortable. Housekeeping comes by later in the afternoon,evening offering robes to be used during your stay. The sink area is very small. Barely big enough for one person to put their items on, much less two. The lighting is terrible, until you realize that the hotel is using the CFL lightblubs that take a while to warm up and brighten up. They don't offer little bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash. They have gone green and installed bottles of aforementioned items in the shower area. Body lotion is not offered. Most if not all rooms have a patio of sorts. It is either in the front of the room, or our the back door. Ours was out the back door and over looked a pond with a fountain and was right next to one of the many pools on the property. Two Adirondake chairs and a small table were on the small patio. No fencing between the patios but it felt secluded anyway. Nice little area to sit, drink a glass of wine and read a book or visit with a loved one or friend. Each room is assigned their own parking space number that matches their room number. The meeting rooms were very nice and plentiful. Many options for a business meeting, a wedding or a prom. (all of which were going on during our stay). While the resort is spreadout, you can easily walk from anywhere on the property to the meeting rooms, and if you have driven to the hotel, you could always drive from your room to the meeting area. Very pretty place, very nice people and I will be back very soon!

The wedding banquet was superb, many guests said the best food ever at a wedding, the service, table settings etc were excellent and the whole day went perfectly - nothing was too much trouble. The main pool was busy but there are a number of other pools that are more tranquil for those who prefer that environment. My bayside bungalow was well furnished and clean on arrival and I was very pleased with the maid service throughout my stay. I slept soundly in a very comfortable bed with little outside noise which is remarkable for the size of the resort. The Baleen restaurant has excellent food and great service. The Barefoot Bar and Grill is less formal and offers good value for money. Service is erratic but improving. Room service was excellent and the hot food arrived hot and always within the estimated time.The poolside food and bar and service was superb with all food being cooked to order in front of you. Also the coffee bar in reception served great coffee and fresh pastries with plenty of comfortable seating both inside and out. Staff are friendly and helpful throughout the resort. With regard to location PP is wonderful. A few minutes walk from SeaWorld and minutes away from local restaurants and other amenities. It is only a short drive from the city yet offers the relaxed feeling that a resort hotel should have. The Spa is wonderful, an oasis of tranquillity. Friendly, helpful staff and excellent therapists. It offers a comprehensive range of treatments and superbly appointed rooms. I was introduced to the Shellac manicure/pedicure and my toes look as good today as the day they were done - 22nd April 2011 - that's nearly five weeks!

Free internet and iPhone-friendly alarm clock, and OK TV on large screens - signal quality varied by channel. Each suite had a tiny kitchenette and a large dining-room table that easily held 4 adults and a toddler's high chair. The master bed was extremely comfortable and the overall impression was almost bucolic. Ducks wandered in the grass, there were fire-pits and the sand. Even the Heat and A/C was not the usual railroad-train quality, but were quiet and even had a fresh-air option. The rooms were very quiet. So quiet that we didn't even know that a prom party with over 80 people was just next door until a HS Senior asked if they had kept us awake! The staff was very friendly and helpful, all the staff, not just the front-desk and wait staff. Even the landscapers and cleaning staff smiled and said hello. We used room service for breakfast a few times. They were friendly and fast, the food was good and delivered hot. Did I mention that it is within walking distance of Sea-World? My son walked it with ease. I downgraded the resort for its restaurants of which we tried two, a casual one with a beachy theme, and a white tablecloth starched-napkin variety. Both feature extremely-high prices. The casual restaurant is in serious need of updating. The bench seats on the booths are padded with worn-out paper thin cushions that might as well not be there. The menu was dull as was the actual food. The drinks were watery. Apparently room service comes from the same kitchen - it is 10 times better. Also, there's a live band on Saturday night. The other restaurant is very much a mixed bag and almost seems to depend on the waiter. We ate there twice. The first time were were served by Brent and the experience was worth every cent of the $100 each we spent. Drinks were strong and well prepared, the appetizers arrived quickly and were delicious. Same goes for the main and dessert courses. Our second experience there was the dinner from hell. The drinks and appetizers went fine. Then we were forgotten. Really. After 3/4 hour my son had to take his toddler son back to the room. I finally managed to attract our waiter from the night before who brought over the manager. He really didn't seem to get it saying that my grandson's food was brought quickly (true). We did eventually get our main courses and the bill was discounted but I would not recommend eating there if they're busy. We didn't try any of the many other amenities.

I'm not sure what Harold is, but he must get out of the wrong side of his nest each day. He was so grumpy while protecting his turf from the numerous sea gulls and egrets and ducks galore. It was a circus. Wish our grandkids were with us. Then the fishing boat arrived back at the dock and the men fed the leftover bait to the fish cruising the surrounding pond. What a commotion in that water! Several types of huge pond fish raced some birds for the biggest treats. All got their fill. The longer we were there, the more we enjoyed the place. The room was great, we had a Bayside Jr. Suite, but save some money and get the Bayside Lanai - I think they are identical, except the Jr. Suite is a bit bigger. Ask about the difference if interested, it is confusing. We did have a \"wet bar\" which used to be called a kitchenette. Still has a small microwave and mini frige and sink. No more burners. Have to ask and probably pay for utensils/dishes or bring your own. Walkilng around, we spotted some Garden View rooms that were really nicely oriented, too. They are all bungalow style. All one floor with patios. Lovely linens. but too firm of a matress. Didn't think to ask for a topper? We played the 18 hole putting course that runs along the entrance drive - and it is really a fun litlle course, white mini-bunkers and all - much nicer than it looks as you are driving in.

First off let me start by saying our son has Asperger's (high functioning autism). We were really wanting a vacation since it had been over five years since we'd taken a \"real\" vacation. Our son likes places that are nice and quiet and not too noisy. After doing some research on the Internet I thought that Paradise Point sounded like a perfect fit for our family. I had read some negative reviews on here before we left so I have to admit I was a tiny bit apprehensive but let me put those fears to rest for you. Paradise Point is the ultimate resort! They have everything!! They have five amazing pools, two awesome restaurants (with gorgous water views), and a beautiful private beach that stretches all around the property. They have firepits all along the beach as well and you and your family can make schmores there at night. The room we had was absolutely amazing!! We were steps from the beach and we had a beautiful room equipped with a fridge, king bed, computer table, nice dressers and two big screen tv's! We were thrilled!! We had a beautiful deck equipped with patio chairs that we sat in every day. Our son loved the fact that there were ducks wandering all over the property and was ecstatic that the same group of three ducks came to our door everyday!! You can buy some food at the gift shop and feed them. Very reasonable price at only $1.50 per bag. Now I mentioned before that our son has high functioning autism so we found this resort to be perfect for children with special needs because of the serenity of it all. Definately not overstimulating and noisy. I have to also mention that I believe this resort is perfect for ANY family!! I think kids of all ages would love it! We are already planning our next trip back!! The customer service is impeccable and all of the employees go above and beyond to meet your needs. They can pick you up in golf carts at any time to take you and your family to one of the pools or dinner..etc. Did I mention there is an awesome store there with everything you could possibly need? My husband and son bought me a beautiful bracelet for an early mother's day gift! Oh and so many activities.... Bike rentals, mini golf, basketball and more!! Not to mention the onsite marina with boat and jet ski rentals. This was the most awesome vacation we have ever been on and I want to spread the word!! Go to Paradise Point for your next vacation!! The location is perfect too!! Two minutes from Seaworld!! Last but definately not least the manager Pat is really awesome! He makes sure everything is running smoothly and that your happy.

After a late journey down from LA we were both tired and hungry and frustrated that no food what so ever was available at the hotel at any time after 10pm. We arrived at around 10:30pm and were given some Pizza take out menus - however these only deliver up to 11pm so no luck there. We had to wait 10 or 15 mins at this late time just to check in as well as the receptionist was dealing with a complaint on the phone - we should have realised then what we were in for. We stayed in a Lanai Garden Bungalow and it was GROSS. Extremely dirty - in fact there was dirty tissue stuck to the bathroom wall and previous guests shaving gel on the shower fitting for the entire 4 night stay. There were dead flies stuck to the ceiling of the bathroom too which was very unpleasant. My partner left a pile of coins - mixed currency on the side the first day when we were out - and out our return we were surprised to find that the maid had taken it! Fair enought it wasn't a huge amount of cash, but surely by the sheer volume of coins that were there was (50+) and the fact that we had not left would make it clear to the maid that this was NOT a tip? We would certainly not tip the LACK of cleaning anyway. Additionally - watch out for the refrigerator in your room. Ours was very loud, so much so that we needed to unplug it in order to get to sleep. We let the maintenance team know and they simply came over the necxt day and replugged it in. We left it unplugged for the remainder of our stay. The walls are also paper thin - if your neighbour runs their tap you'll surely be woken up - you can hear everything that it going on around you from the room which makes for some poor nights sleep and very little chance of a lie in. To sum up - this hotel is very beautiful on the outside (grounds / restaurants / lobby etc) - however the owners a clearly too tight to invest on the inside.

I did not expect the hotel to be as good as it was. It truly was a pleasure to stay here. Because the rooms are bungalow style, our stay was very peaceful with no noise issues the whole week. We were able to send the kids off on a surrey bike, they loved being free to roam without us. We felt comfortable to let them go on their own since the whole property is private. The rooms were newly renovated, and the theme was cute. The beds were super comfortable. There was plenty of towels, and drawer space. I loved the coffee makers- they were the single cup brew style, so the coffee would not get stale. The shampoo, conditioner, body soap were really nice- pump style so we did not run out. The 18-hole putt-putt golf was a fun bonus. We loved the beach, the water-sport rentals (we rented a speed boat and paddle boat at reasonable prices), the many pools and hot tubs dotted throughout the property, the beautiful park-like setting with water fountains and whimsical artwork all around, and the fire pits on the beach and some of the pool areas. I liked most that they did not enforce the pool hours in a super strict way; the guests that stayed on were very respectful of the quiet hours... it was a win-win. The poolside bar, waterfront cafe, and waterfront restaurant were all wonderful, good ambiance and good food (but a little overpriced). I bought multiple things from the store (including the replacement for a forgotten swimsuit), they had everything there; we even purchased zoo tickets from them since they were the better deal at the time. The negative drawback, was that they nickel-and-dimed their guests. They added a nightly parking charge and the prices in their restaurants and shop are high, we have no choice but to pay since the property is on an island.

They basically \"walk in off the street\" so to speak, dragging in all the dirt from the street. The floors are dark-brown wood, which camoflages the appearance, but your feet tell the ultimate story. Other than the extremely dirty floors, the hotel is quite nice. The beds are nice, the bathroom is nice, and the location is great. It's a very nice hotel.

On the advice of a San Diego local who said it was the most kid-friendly resort. This is true, up to a certain point... It is kid friendly during the day. We stayed a week in one of the bayside villas. During that week, therewere three huge, catered parties on the beach right outside our room with blasting music that went on until past 10pm. We were still on east coast time, so it was really a nuisance. Our kids are 10 & 7, so it wasn't horrible for us, but had they been babies or toddlers it would have been a nightmare trying to get them to sleep. As it was, we were all a little more groggy for our excursions.. Though the beach seems it should be private, you should know it is adjacent to a public picnicking area and parking lot so you get locals all day long who use the beach for entry into the water for kayaking, paddle boarding,biking, etc.. There are several fire pits on the beach, which we enjoyed using on a few occasions, but we found on the weekend that the locals also wandered over and used those too (dragging scrap wood from their trucks in the parking lot) and there is no security or anyone even bothering to check whether beachgoers are guests or not. I have nothing against locals, but we were spending a lot of money to not have at least first dibs. Lack of security, in general bothered me, especially with kids. One night there were 4 loud,drunk adults shouting on the beach at 3:30AM right outside my door and I had no idea if they were guests of the hotel or not and who I should call. Service at this resort is non- existent. This is the first time EVER in my life I did not tip housekeeping. There were some days that the only evidence they had even been there was that the the trash was emptied and the master bed was made (but they didn't bother to put the pull-out couch back or make up the cot). Luckily we're pretty neat people or the place would have been gross. When we arrived there was a dirty tray from the previous guests room service and they didn't come to pick up our room service trays until a day later. The pros: location is excellent. Very centrally located. The property is beautiful and spacious. There are activities for families to choose from. The restaurant is good, even by NY standards. The gift shop has a very nice selection of necessities, souvenirs and even clothes/ bathing suits/ sun shirts/ flip flops/etc. The villa was just OK. It was big enough for our family of 4.

They never had more than two people working and for the life of me I never figured it out. Anyway, not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, just not the service I was expecting. Next, the room. We had a \"garden\" or non-beach room, but it ended up with a great view so we were pleased. The beach there is very nice, so again, great plus. The floors in the unit, however, were disappointing. They were dirty and I'm not sure when the last time was they were mopped and cleaned. To make matters worse, our ceiling in the bathroom had black stuff all over it along with yellow spots. It looked like no one had cleaned it for months. I was literally astounded, again, this is supposed to be a top-notch resort. I complained the next day and they fixed it right away - and did a great job. Other than that, the room was fine. There was wireless internet so that was great (it was free, or you could pay in your room for cat-5 connection.) The resort is very pretty. The landscaping is gorgeous and the pools and hot tubs were great. It's great for the kids as they have the \"ocean-type\" walk-in to the pool, if that makes any sense. All the kids were having a good time for sure. Major plus. On the flip side, and this could be just me so maybe this isn't an issue, but when I've stayed at other resorts, the reason why your room charge was so high is because everything is included. Not so here. You have to pay for everything: Bike rides, mini-golf, etc. You had to pay for internet (until I found the wireless internet the resort provided), and the gym was $12/day. I was really taken back by this, for when comparing it to say, Club Med, once you walk into the resort, everything is included. I know it's not apples-to-apples, but I think I was expecting a Club Med type service/situation and I just didn't get it. The food though was terrific. The grill was ok, but the Baleen was fantastic (pricey, but well worth it - Dinner and drinks for me and the wife was $120 before tip). All in all, it's a nice place. The beach looked nice, but it is so cold this time of year in SD don't even think about getting into the ocean. The resort seemed over-priced and I doubt I would return.

It was easy to get to, easy to find. even-though it is tucked away on an island in the Bay. There is a feel of openness as well as a feel of being well maintained just upon entering. After taking a leisure walking tour of the grounds I am glad that we did not get a room facing the beach. Though it has it's 3 pluses, 1), not much of a walk to get sand between your toes, 2), fire pit is practically yours (though it is 1st come 1st serve) and 3), if you get a West facing room, the sunset is yours from your cozy comfortable room. The reason I liked our grounds facing room was 1st the grounds are amazing (like you are in a manicured jungle though it won't look that way from the front entrance of the room), the breeze from the Bay is VERY gusty, and 3.) the view of the bay is, well... Boring, almost desolate. The grounds are very Disney World like in as much as the planing , care and cleanliness. We found it very relaxing and special. As for the rooms. we had some pleasant surprises, one mildly unpleasant one and 3 confusing ones. Confusing.... Parking spaces very tight ( I had to let my girlfriend out before I parked because in order to leave space for the guest parking spot next to me I had to let the leaves from the plants brush tightly along the side of my truck and we both thought it was odd that we had to enter into a shared (card locked) foyer before using the same card lock key to get into our room. Imagine after entering trough your front door, you are now in a hallway that only goes left or right (kind of like when you go to a larger theater and you have a choice to go the left side of the theatre or the right) and that there one room at each end. Thankfully the beds where not on adjacent walls. The last confusing part was that parking is an additional 25.00, but thankfully they waved this and gave a 36.00 voucher towards a meal at one of their restaurants. Not sure why, but my guess might be because of the booking problem I had when I booked on the net (I had to call to get it fixed, and they were extremely nice. Very efficient and all about fixing and pleasing) or maybe because we went in the middle of the week (Wednesday). Not sure, but was VERY appreciative!! The mildly unpleasant surprise was once we entered this hallway it smelled like there might be a pool in the next room. I am guessing that is what the other reviewers are refereeing to when they say \"moldy\", but to us it really smelled like we just entered into an enclosed swimming area. The best surprise was after we opened the drapes and saw the grounds from our own patio. You could not tell at all even after driving around or when we parked, that this was going to be part of our experience. Though the patio was was ours it was not exclusive ( we could see other rooms on the other side of the narrow lagoon) It was still quite nice, the breeze was perfect and once we were in our room, access to my truck was easier then going through the sudo foyer. We did not encounter the same experience other reviewers had in reference to un-cleanliness in the room or hearing our neighbors. Though we weren't really looking hard, everything seemed clean. Nothing jumped out at us and made us think ewwww that's gross. the other really nice surprises, were no bed bugs and the comfort of the bed was heavenly. Two last things... the food at Baleen's (on site restaurant was not only perfectly prepared and the best tasting it was visually pleasing as well. The Barefoot Bar & Grill (the other restaurant on the grounds) had so many great choices for breakfast that we ended up splitting our food. The coffee and the OJ wasn't the best and were the only disappointing parts of the breakfast. TIP....Ask for a resort specialist to see what deals they have going and not all grounds facing rooms are equal as far as view, some are amazing and more private and some are no frills.

She told us one of the rooms was ready but we had to wait a while for the second room to be cleaned. We went to the room to unload our luggage and take a peak at the room. No mold smell this was good, went to wash my hands and noticed the counter was dirty so I took one of there pretty white wash cloths to wash it down with and it turned black along with hair it picked up.

We are now loaded back up and head for the new rooms, we walk into the first room to be greeted by the smell of MOLD (they must have known this was a problem since they had the bathroom fan on) so off we go to get another set of rooms. This time a gentlemen helped me, he took off our parking charge and gave us a resort credit for the incontinence and offered to upgrade us to a nice room on the beach but we would be sleeping with the kids on a roll-away (give us one room instead of the 2 that we paid for). I declined since I didn't want to sleep with the teenage boys, so he gave us two rooms in the back 40.

So don't forget flip flops for everyone if you don't want to shower twice before bed. It was like this everyday, on day number 4 they didn't leave us clean wash cloths so I stopped by the front desk to ask for some explaining the reason about black feet. The supervisor talked to me telling me it was not expectable and she would have our room cleaned in detail the next day including getting those floors mopped. I then went to the spa to have a pedicure and manicure done for $258 why not since my floors would finally be clean (it was worth the cost Jennifer was amazing). Needless to say the cleaning we were told would be done WAS NOT. Dirty floors, dirty tub, dirty glasses, dirty counter tops, dirty chairs, and they never wipe down the tables in the rooms. Six blissful days of a dirty room, I'm just keeping it real. Love the fact too that a moldy butter knife set outside the front door on the ground for 6 days (it was there when we got there), you would think the housekeeper would at least pick it up after walking over it everyday.

This is the first hotel in 20 years that I didn't leave a tip for room service. This hotel is filthy and was a complete disappointment. We had two king suites on the bay beach and stayed for 3 days. The only reason we continued our stay is because we were gone all day at the SD zoo and SeaWorld - otherwise we would have changed hotels. I can't believe American Express recommended this place. The furnishings look like the pictures but the rooms we stayed in smelled of mold and animal urine, the carpets were filthy and the travertine tile in both our suites had not been mopped and had hair throughout the suite. The rooms we stayed in had stains on the walls that could have been easily wiped up. The rooms has very poor ventilation and moisture builds up at night which intensifies the poor smell. You won't find a telephone book or a clock in these rooms or any kind of utensils other than the two tiny dirty glasses in the bathroom. So if you want to drink a glass of California wine - good luck. If our housekeeping was indicative of everyone else's experience, the entire department should be fired. They were very inconsistent. One day they brought coffee and one day they didn't. One day they forgot soap and then gave 2 soaps the next day. They made the bed and gave new towels but didn't clean the floors or vacuum the rug. Also - the beach on the side we stayed on is sad. The bay is not the ocean. Right outside our suite was some kind of concrete runoff gone amuck. It was a danger enough that I didn't feel comfortable having my 7 and 10 yr old play football in that area. To top it off, my 3 year old with sensitive skin got a rash all over his face the one night he slept on the hotel pillow rather than his pillow pet. I mentioned the cleanliness issue to the front desk as I checked out. She responded that it was an issue the hotel was addressing and took off my parking and internet charges.

Check-in was a breeze.Lobby area was welcoming. ROOM: Yes, it was a little strange having our\"beach-style\" bungalow right next to the road where the guests would drive by. The view outside of our door was the road and then the lagoon. So not much privacy if you open the shades. Speaking of which, the shade covering the door was too sheer and the lights of the cars would shine really brightly into the room, which was a minor annoyance. The decor was tropical island inspired and modern. The flat screen was nice, the refrigerator worked well, bed was firm and comfy. No dresser for clothes. Like other people said, the renovation on the bathroom was a quickie one. Coat of paint slapped on. They should have replaced the showerheads. Looks old and outdated. The water pressure is awful. It took forever to take a shower. Killed some bugs each day. Not a big deal though. GROUNDS: The landscaping and lagoon was so lush and beautiful. That part really felt tropical. We loved walking around with our little one, exploring the resort. They have many little pools scattered around (some for adults only and some for the family) and fire pits. You can make smores and stuff on the fire pits (they sell kits at the gift shop for $25, along with firewood...really expensive....byo). They have bikes for rent and a miniature golf area....very family friendly, but everything is expensive. LOCATION: Very close to Mission Bay, Seaworld, LOTS of great restaurants. All of the places we ate at nearby were good. We just looked on Yelp for recommendations. Also ate at Barefoot Bar for breakfast both days and had no problems. DO NOT feed the birds. They are VERY aggressive and we saw this other guest who had left his table outside for a second and the birds swooped in and started eating his food. Baleen is the higher end restaurant, right next to Barefoot. Didn't eat here during our stay. We also went to Balboa Park which was only 15 minutes away. So everything is very convenient.

We had a suite that you walked directly into from the driveway, and it had a private patio with a little creek behind it. It was very relaxing and very different from a traditional hotel experience. The location was great too. We rented a car and found it very easy to get around San Diego and its surrounding areas. It would only take between 2-10minutes to get anywhere, even downtown. And, our room had a parking spot right next to the door, so parking was extremely convenient. Although we were spending our honeymoon there, we were also impressed with how family friendly Paradise Point is (yet, we didn't feel over run by kids- definitely a plus for newlyweds just wanting to spend some quality-quiet time together for their honeymoon). We feel as though when we have a family we would definitely go back and stay there.

The rooms were beautifully situated and had every convenience, easy parking and nicely appointed in a California beach meets Bali kind of ambiance. Lunch in the sunshine outside the barefoot grill was reasonably priced at about 80 dollars for 4 with drinks Beer and a cocktail or two. Suffering from acute hunger after a Freeway ordeal we dived into Wagyu burgers with relish, ours not the burgers, and passed up more adventurous fare which seemed to be pleasing our neighbors admirably. The first experience was excellent, good lunch , wonderful atmosphere and setting overlooking the bay. Great Start. We moved on to Sea World and came back in the evening to Baleen the signature restaurant at paradise Point. Gourmet food at excellent prices with inspired service led by Chris Kindig. Every dish was a highpoint from the split pea soup with smoked duck , the subtle apple brined pork chop and tomato and maple glazed salmon. There are good value possibilities in the choice too with Margaret River Semillon Chardonnay at 34 dollars a bottle and the 3 for 30 dining option which allows 3 courses for 30 dollars on a prix fixe menu.

We stayed in room 212, which had nice interior decor. the back door opened up to a patio that had lounge chairs and we were steps away from the sand. There were also a couple bonfire pits scattered along the beach. Our room had an especially nice view of the sunset. For dinner we went to Baleen, didn't need a reservation and were seated on the deck right next to the water. The dinner menu was fairly expensive but the food was worth it; the Australian lamb prime rib was divine. The restaurant didn't have the stuffy feeling associated with other restaurants of that caliber. I actually felt a bit overdressed in a dress shirt and slacks.

Plus side Great location, Easy driving distance from the airport, Sea World, Old Town San Diego (great restaurants in Old Town), parks etc. The resort feels very lush with many pools to choose from, and the fire pits are a nice touch. Staff was helpful with directions and at check-in. (your on your own getting to your room) The Negatives: Stayed in room 158, the beds are the worst I've ever slept on. The beds in the room need to be replaced, they are saggy, and every time you moved the springs creaked like a cheap motel 6 bed. (Wife and I had the worst sleep ever on a bed here) As mentioned from a previous reader, resort is quite large and when we checked in, we got a map and basically had to fend for yourself to find the room. It was kinda funny watching people wander around looking for their room especially at night when its dark at the resort. Not cool. Their high end restaurant (Baleen) is way over priced and average food. Wife ordered the steak and I had the halibut dish. Both were very salty. This is to bad since the location is lovely and the waiter was nice. Their other restaurant (Barefoot) has okay, breakfast food nothing special, their dinner wasn't great. Again nice location. The waiter/waitresses were average Paying $25.00 per day for parking and $9.95 per day for slow internet is ridiculous. Isn't the rooms expensive enough?? My one major recommendation if you stay in their garden view rooms is request a room that isn't facing the road around the resort.

I'm not sure if it is the recent change in management, but it was FABULOUS!!! Since it was our first anniversary, I brought the top layer to our wedding cake with me from Reno. When I landed, I called the hotel to see if I could drop off the cake immediately so I didn't have to carry it around since we weren't checking in until the next day. Of course was the answer and they went so far out of their way from there to make our stay special. I dropped off the cake and they put it into their catering refrigerator for safe keeping. We also got our room upgraded to a prime bay front room, they delivered the cake while we were out on our anniversary with everything we would need including champagne! The room location was perfect with a quiet setting, a beach right outside our door with a fire pit for fires, vaulted ceiling with a wall of windows looking out at the bay. Parking was right next to our room and it felt like coming home each night rather than going to a hotel. The grounds are magnificent with lots of greenery, lagoons, pools, and beach. All rooms are in one story buildings and most are connected to only a few rooms per building. Views vary greatly by room and you pay more for the better views... but they are worth it! It's very relaxing to look out on the bay or even a lagoon... not so relaxing to look out onto a parking lot for the cheap rooms. We ate breakfast at the Barefoot Grille with great service and good food. A beautiful view of the bay on the deck came with heaters making it pleasant to enjoy the deck. We had quick service, but weren't rushed. The only downside to the resort is that the rooms are showing their wear. They have done a good job with new flooring, new furniture, and new granite counters, but the microwave was ancient, the tub was rusted, and little things like the peephole was cracked (although there was a window right next to the door). Even this didn't deter much though. It's an older resort which comes with the great grounds and larger rooms so it's worth it. Everything was clean, just older. I highly recommend staying at the Paradise Point. The staff are amazing, properties relaxing, and the location cannot be beat.

From my understanding this hotel has recently been taken over by a new company which has begun/ already completed some major renovating. The grounds are pretty and very well manicured (reminded me of Hawaii) and the hotel is unique because it sits on its own island right in mission bay. The location is good if you're looking for a relaxing , resort-like feel, and want to be close to the beach. Although I would not advise you swim in the bay, it is very close to the Pacific side beaches and other San Diego attractions. There are tons of pools and water activities The hotel's unique setting is about the only thing I found charming about this place. The rooms LOOK nice but a closer look would reveal that it is a small facelift on a VERY old hotel. The rooms all seemed to be a good size and have neat outdoor lounge areas (some with great views). However the beds are not very comfortable and the bathrooms still seem to have the \"original\" hardware. I would guess the original hotel must have been built in the 60's-70's and it shows. Many of the exterior buildings, pools and facilities show hints of their age which just made it feel.....old. The service seemed to be average. Nothing above and beyond. We did eat at the more upscale restaurant between the few that are on the property and it was a very good dinner but it was a bit on the pricey side. A lot of nickel and dime-ing (25$/ day to park!!! = ridiculous) Basically, I feel like this hotel is pretending to be something it is not. I give it credit for trying to be some sort of 5-Star resort, but unfortunately the pools, rooms, structures, design, service etc. just are more of a 3-Star which makes the room pricing a bit ridiculous. I would NEVER stay at this hotel if the rooms were anymore than $150/night (for the more standard rooms anyway). Overall we had an enjoyable average stay. Good for just a weekend trip.

They had 2 low back chairs on the patio, perfect for enjoying a glass of wine and watching the beautiful sunset while the kids play safely and within eyes view at the water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge. The resort had numerous pools, which the kids loved, and we enjoyed the restaurant on the premises, they had live music and was a very busy and buzy hangout. We enjoyed beautiful walks on the beach; you can rent boats, jet skis, kayaks etc. Outside each bungalow are large fire pits, where at night you can enjoy toasting S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mores, which we did every night. They had a great gift shop at the resort and sold amazing S\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mores kits. They also have mini golf courses and bike rentals. On our last day we were supposed to leave really early to go to Lego land but we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tear ourselves away, it was just so relaxing.

Absolutely overrun with ants!!! I'm told this place has undergone a facelift with many of its rooms (ours included) being redone. The room we have is nice. Comfortable firm king bed, freshly painted and a large updated bathroom. The furnishings are a bit awkward. Leopard print throw rug, green couch and mismatched furniture. I'm not sure what the theme is for the art work but it's quite weird. The room is cabana style and opens up to a terrace that is right on the beach. About 5 steps and your standing in sand. Twenty more and your ankle deep in the bay. The grounds are immaculate with manicured grass and beautiful water features Now for the bad stuff. You can tell they didn't go all the way with the renovation. The walls aren't actually redone they are just painted over. The vinyl curtains definitely show their age. The refrigerator and microwave look to be the first models of their kind and I haven't seen this particular style of air conditioner since the 70ies. Also there are no utensils of any kind in the kitchen. Plates forks knives cups, are all absent. Worst of all was the cleanliness or lack thereof. There is a sticky film on everything and dust bunnies everywhere they could possibly be. The windows looked like they haven't been touched in years! The worst of the worst is the ants. They are all over the room and especially in the kitchen. We are contemplating leaving and finishing up our stay in the area at another hotel. It is that bad, the place is infested. The maid tells us all of the rooms on the beach are as bad. We have had a maintenance man come out and spray and they are still all over the place. The worst part is that the management knew about the ant problem and have not done anything about it. (Edit) Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, we leave for the day with a guarantee from the staff that everything will be made right when we come back. We are back and nothing has changed.

Our stay was for three nights. We had two bayside bungalow rooms (adjoining.....may want to re-think that as the grandkids had \"easy access\" to grams and gramps at 6am! haha) that had \"awe-mazing\" views of the bay, were clean, quiet and beautifully decorated. Bed was comfortable and linens were crisp and clean. The kitchen and bathroom were great - good water pressure, plenty of storage and lots of towels. Our plan was not to have to leave the facility at all and to enjoy all the resort has to offer and we had great success! We rented tandem bikes, played the mini-golf course, went to the main pool several times and spent a lot of time on the bay's beach. The lagoon area was a huge hit with the kids, as they have hundreds of ducks and birds that the kids can feed (the cranes were amazing to see!). We rented two jet-skis one day and a large motor-boat another day so the entire family could experience Mission Bay together. SO much fun! The marina staff were knowledgeable and friendly, the vehicles were in great shape and the prices were reasonable. We ate at the Barefoot Bar & Grill three times and ate at the Tropics Poolside Grill once. The food was good and the prices were reasonable (there were 7 of us and the tabs ranged from $70-$100). The staff at each were very nice. We loved the fire-pits on the beach and had a fire going every each night. We made s'mores each night and cooked hot dogs one night. A GRANDPARENT'S DREAM: We hardly had the TV on at all during the trip and the kids never asked to play Nintendo DS or video games - there were SO many things to do, it was great! As for the bad online reviews that were somewhat scary to read before we left....... a few things: 1. The $25 parking fee. Your parking space is right by your room - super convienent. The fee prevents \"non-resort\" people from coming in, using the facility and clogging up the roads and the beach area. It was worth it and seems fair - would you want \"Joe Blow\" parking next to your room? No. 2. Ants, bugs, dirty floors and old rusty fixtures. This is a beautiful tropical, sandy beach setting - you can not help but track in some sand (the grandkids did a great job of that! haha - felt sorry for the housekeeper!). I saw one spider - the horror! (LOL) and a few ants...big deal. The room was recently re-modeled, so did not see any old rusty fixtures, but even if I did, c'mon this place was originaly built back in, what? The 1950s or something? They have done a great job keeping it current. 3. \"Nickeled and Dimed\". Not really! We paid $20 an hour for the tandem bikes, $8-10 for the mini golf, $95hr each for the jet-skis and $150hr for the large boat. ALL REASONABLE. The ONLY bad thing to say is that there were one or two lagoon areas that needed some TLC. We could understand why some people would not appreciate having their room facing them. It seems like they are upgrading the lagoons though, as the ones on the west side of the property looked great. We all had such a good time that we are thinking of coming back next Summer.

The entire family was looking forward to this vacation. The web page for the resort was breathtaking. It made it seem like we would be on a tropical island. As we drove up the drive way it seems tropical. But as we pulled up to the lobby there was no bell man to help with the luggage. That should have been the first clue that this was not a 4 star resort. I walked into the lobby while my husband waited in the car with our kids. The lobby was small and looked a little out dated (clue number two). The gentleman at the front desk told me that we would be charged $25.00 a night for parking, that we had not been told at the time of booking. And if I wanted to park for free that it would be a 15 minute walk outside of the resort grounds. Once we had been given our room number we got back into our car and headed out to find our room. As we drove around we noticed the flat roof style huts with one door but two room numbers. They don't show you this at all on the web page (clue number three). At this point we don't like what we saw but hoped that the inside of the room would make up for the exterior of the buildings. We open the door to our hut and notice two more doors. One to our room and that of another room in the small hallway that connected us, the foor was discustingly dirty. It looked like it hadn't been swept in weeks. Cobwebs all along the walls with dead bugs in them. Once we walked into our room the smell of mold over powered us!! The beds where new with nice headboards and a new flat screen TV, but that couldn't block the smell out. The shower head was rusted and half falling out. All along the tub we could see the mold, crack and rust. The tropical view from our room was one of a fence with dried out plants that gave us a view of the busy street outside the resort. I couldn't believe this was the same resort I had seen on the web. I felt robbed and cheated. Who rated this place more then 1-2 star was crazy. We were not in the room for more then 15 minutes when I called the front desk and asked for a full refund and checked out. This resort is fine if you expect a 2 star place.

We stayed in a Lanai Garden Room, the cheapest room at the resort, for $310 a night after taxes, etc, which was the negotiated rate for the conference. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay for parking, internet or the gym as they were included in this price. I found the internet speed to be VERY slow and am very happy I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to pay for it. Room: The room was nicely decorated but the bed was hard as a rock. The bathroom had paint peeling off the walls and the toilet was way too close to the door. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure why it was placed so close to the wall when there was plenty of room to in the bathroom to move it away from the wall. We had a small fridge in the room that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working when we arrived. We called to have it fixed and maintenance was there quick to fix it even though we called at 10:30 pm. View: Our view was supposed to be of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd however we had a view of vehicles who parked in front of our door or the building across the street. We asked about an upgrade and were told we could pay an additional $100 a night for a bigger \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd view, we decided to stay with the room we had. Location: They will tell you Sea World is a 10 minute walk, this is NOT true. It was more like a 30+ minute walk. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a $20+ cab ride to anywhere (Old Town, Downtown, Balboa Park, etc.). They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer any shuttle services so a 6 day trip got expensive quick. Pools: There were multiple pools. The only ones we visited were the main pool (to eat at the diner) and the adult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only pool. The main pool was very loud and crowded. The adult only was nice when there were no teenyboppers running around. There was no hotel staff there to enforce the adult only rule. Restaurants: There are 3 restaurants on site. Since everything else is so far away you pretty much have to eat there. We visited all 3 of the restaurants over our 6 day stay. They are all over priced with slow service.

I hope you find this review helpful before you book your trip. I have vacationed at a Sandals Resort in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, a resort in Cancun, Mexico, and the Hyatt Hill Country Resort in San Antonio, Texas. Paradise Point in San Diego does not come close to any one of these other resorts and the San Antonio resort I mention doesn't even have an ocean, lake, river or any type of body of water around except for their excellent man made lazy river that runs around the entire pool area. First of all - It is over priced. The grounds are not gated and while enjoying a nice quadracycle rental in the property we noticed what appeared to be a local police officer talking to a guest about what looked like a car break in. We also had someone run through our patio that hotel security staff was chasing. The pool area was not impressive at all - its a little larger than the average hotel pool but no slides or diving boards or anything really unique like you would find on other resorts. The room was old - averagely cleaned - we had purchased some food for breakfast one night to find ants crawling all over it the next morning. After complaining to the front desk - received a $100 credit at one of their restaurants - the food was bland and very average for the price - we tried to use the credit at the restaurant but we chose to eat out the rest of our trip. Also - cheap pergo flooring and knock off scandanavian furniture does not make it a 4 star room and the old noisy window units....really? We took a drive to La Jolla about 15 - 20 minutes away. We saw the real paradise in La Jolla. In La Jolla - you can really enjoy the beach - \"not\" the bay. The bay at Paradise Point is nice but you really don't want to swim in it - kayaking and fishing are fine but actually putting your body in there - at your own risk. We have concluded - our next trip to the San Diego area - will be in La Jolla. Anywhere relatively near the beach is fine - Wow - what a beach! You have it all in La Jolla including the aquarium and the zoo and Balboa Park are only 20 minutes away. In conclusion - Paradise Point should be called Motel 6 on Paradise Point.

The lobby was beautiful and the front desk service was very friendly. We told her about our experience at the other places and she told us she would place us in a great location on the property. Our room was more like a bungalow. It was very large for a family of 4 and we really loved that we were only a few feet from the beach. We called to the front desk to extend out stay to a full week from 4 days. They have 5 pools on site, so we rotated pools and the main pool has food and drinks. The service at the main pool was outstanding! The kids all at the pool got blow up animals to play with at the pool. They have a great little store on the grounds and they are close to Pacific Beach so you can also go out of the grounds to get food etc. They also have great room service. We ordered one night and got our food 30 min later. Then at night you go out to the beach and reserve a fire pit.

We enjoyed the lagoon pool, but it got noisy and crowded late in the afternoon when everyone returned from their day's outings, so that's when we retreated to the peace and quiet of another pool right next to our room.

YES, this place is great for families. Lots of things to do, but we never had an opportunity to try any out as we LEFT after one night stay. We were at Disney all day and knew that we would be arriving late. Upon arrival we were directed to a Presidential Room (the 800 buildings). I thought we were lucky to have gotten this suite. I wanted to check out the room before unloading the car. I went in to find only a king bed (we are a family of 5). We reserved a 1 bedroom garden view. Called front desk and she informed me that our room is having maintenance issues and that we would have to change bungalows (tis was NEVER mentioned upon checking in) We explained the room would not accommodate all of us and she stated that she could put us in a one bedroom bungalow with a bayside view, but we would still have to change since this room is reserved for another beginning the next day. After some discussion with her, she agreed to find something else for the other party and let us have this room the entire duration of our stay. So now I thought that we were on a great start of our stay at Paradise Point. When we got to the room, well their description of newly remodeled is...musty smells from the bathroom shower area, in wall air conditioning units with mold growing on the outside of it, new floors throughout and granite counter is the bathroom, but the paint looked like it would peel off an minute, sticky to the touch and the cabinets throughout were just painted over not NEW. I thought the kitchen are would have more than a microwave and tiny refrigerator...no utensils, stove, plates, coffee maker...not a full kitchen! The window treatments were faux wood blinds that were not working. Our particular bungalow was the last in the row with a beautiful hedge on the side. Since we arrived so ate we were not able to see the grounds, but in the morning my husband walked out side, popped his head over the hedge to fine that there were public restrooms on the other side with HOMELESS people sleeping of the floor. Security was a huge issue for us with three children! This was enough for us! For the amount of money per night and then for all the extras, we were able to make reservations at the Grand Del Mar and pay just about the same amount (I am going to write a WONDERFUL review for them in a few moments). We went to the front desk and told them how dissatisfied we were and they refunded us our money (which after 1 1/2 weeks, I am still waiting for the refund to show on the online credit card statement). The negative reviews are right on! I reread through them and after being there I absolutely agree!!!!!

The tower was fun to climb in the morning to get my blood pumping and see a pretty view of Mission Bay and even some of sea world!

Also within 15 minutes (traffic permitting) from downtown, airport , zoo etc.... And, within a 5-10 minute drive to Trader Joes and Von's supermarket.

Room was more than we expected---ours was fairly spacious with a king bed, and a pull-out couch, which was perfect for our 2 young boys.

While the room rate we got seemed fairly reasonable (about $129/nite+parking) for what we got and the location, the extras seemed a bit pricey---restaurants, duck food, s'mores kits, mini golf club rental fees and your other typical incidentals, not to mention the parking..... While the room was nice, the dark ceramic floor tile made the room a bit dark and gloomy, especially at nite. Also, my feet were always dirty after walking barefoot on this tile. Bathroom was a bit dated, plus the exhaust fan didn't work worth a crap (pun intended)..... Other than the sliding back door, it would have been nice to have a couple windows that opened. Overall, i would <U>definitely</U> recommend this resort to people with kids. For singles or couples w/o kids, it's your call----this place has a ton of kids.

We were quite a walk from the main pool. Our bungalo faced a pond that had scum on it. I think if you were facing the beach or pool you'd enjoy it more. But we did go for a lower priced room. No coffee pot in the room, and it was a 5 minute walk to the coffee cart were you could stand in line and buy black coffee for $3.50 a cup. You even had to pour that yourself out of a hot pot. It took four hours to get more toliet paper delivered to the room. They only provided two glasses and no ice bucket. The exterior light was burned out so it was dark approaching our room at night. For $22 you could get a smore kit but firewood and a lighter cost extra. They offered us a complimentary newspaper on the way out but it was a day old. And they had someone else's room $82 room service charge on our bill. If money isn't an issue then go for it and get a beach front room. You'd probably enjoy that. They do provide a fridge for no extra charge. Parking is $25 per day. It was nice dining by the water at the barefoot bar and grill.

Our kids 2 and 6 LOVED being able to dig in the sand daily and find seashells. We even saw seals and otters in the bay. Could swim in it too, but it's was chilly when we were there. We all LOVED the shark lagoon over by the marina and Barefoot Beach restaurant ( i think that is the name). Great place to eat outside, but watch out for the birds! They stole my husband's salmon one night! Nice lava waterfall there. The kids were really entertained while waiting for their food b/c of being able to watch the leopard sharks and flounder fish, rays. Really neat! Baleen restaurant was really good too! Excellent food and service! It's a little fancy, but we went early to dinner and they were great w/the kids there too! The only downside about this hotel is that there are no coffeemakers in the rooms, but there is a coffee cart near the Gift shop. And the ventilation in our room was poor so our wet suits/towels never dried out unless we put them outside in the sun. Would be fun to go back in the summer so the kids could try the kids camp.

Check-in took FOREVER because they were having a hard time finding a room that we could stay in for the duration of the conference as well as the weekend before which we had booked for our own enjoyment. The room itself was a big disappointment. Shabby describes it best. It was fairly clean, but other conference attendees were complaining about bugs and mold in their rooms. Housekeeping was unpredictable. One day we'd get one fresh towel, and the next day we'd get four. Sometimes the shampoos would get replaced, sometimes not. It was bizarre.

The ducks are everywhere - which I don't mind at all - but they've got to stay on top of the poop and feathers, seriously.

Take this review with a grain of salt - we typicallly stay at Ritz Carltons. We picked this hotel because we were visiting a relative who lives very close by - and it was recommended. It was inexpensive - we had some package that i think the room ended up being around 150ish a nite. The room was large - there was a big sofa as well as a king sized bed. Unfortunately the first night the heating/air unit leaked a huge puddle of water and there were ants around the bath tub. I called maintenance in the morning. We returned home late at night (1030 pm) and the heating unit had been fixed but housekeeping had never come to the room. Unmade bed and wet towels. Ugh. I called the front desk (I was furious) and they offered to send housekeeping over. I turned that offer down - we were exhausted and wanted to go to bed. I told the person i would like to speak to a manager. She said a manager would not be in until 3 PM the next day. I said \"have the manager call me so I can express my irritation with him/her. If i dont hear from him/her I will post it on trip advisor so they can read it there\". Obviously I never got a call. The ants remained our entire stay - but they were only in/and around the tub so we didnt bother reporting them again. The restaurant Baleen is nice - we had a good dinner and good servcie there on valentines day. The service at the bar (at Balleen) is BAD. We stopped by one night for a drink. No one else was sitting at the bar. We asked to see a wine list. The bar tender gave us a list and then proceeded to rearrange the liquor bottles and also fill waiters orders (from the tables). I am not kidding - 10 minutes go by and his back was to us the entire time. Finally i say \"excuse me sir - i am sorry - do we need to sit at a table to order a glass of wine?\" I said it very nicely and of course he didnt get the fact that i was being sarcastic. He said \"oh - you can order here what can i get you?\" Whatever. At the casual restaurant by the water - i went there alone for breakfast one morning. I waitied 10 minutes for a menu - 10 minutes for coffee. The omelet was very good. Had to ask 3 people to find the waiter to get the check. There was plenty of staff - i guess they were hanging out in the kitchen talking to each other. The place wasnt crowded - no excuse. The internet service at the business center is afortune. If i recall it was like 9 bucks for 15 minutes . Ridiculous. They charge 25 bucks a nite to park there. The workout room was pretty nice and not crowded.

That is standard on close to the water places. If you love incredible landscaping and garden style apartment versus high rise, you will like this place.

And for that reason, I cannot complain, but will give my views after staying there. Check in was very nice....attractive lobby and staff very nice and welcoming. We arrived early (11am) and they were able to give us a room. Mind you, this is early November and it was a Sunday morning...not prime tourist season. But I did appreciate being able to drop our bags in our room as we had a full day planned and did not plan on being back to the hotel until later in the evening. And it is a good thing that we did. If we would have waited until it was dark, we may not have found our room. The lay out can be a bit confusing....the roads in the resot are very narrow and buildings are not marked very clearly. Our room happened to be on the \"back-side\" of a building...that made for confusion on how to get to it. The room was a \"bungalow\" type with a nice, small enclosed patio area at the entrance. They have two nice chairs to enjoy the outdoors. Being on the \"back-side\" of the building was good for this reason as it gave you more privacy from the parking area. The room, upon entrance, looked inviting...nice color scheme and pleasant layout...but it did have a rather musty smell as some people have stated before. It wasn't horrible enough to warrent changeing rooms....but was a little distracting. (that is the reason for only 3* for cleanliness) Because we were there during off-season, we did not use the grounds or pool areas. But they appeared to be well kept and attractive. The pool areas looked nice...one had a fire pit area that would be nice to have used if we had been there longer. I also liked the fact that they had an \"adults only\" pool....but we did not use it for this trip. Cleanliness (3*) because of slight musty smell) Location (4*) is really good...across the street from SeaWorld. So if you have children and this is your primary reason to visit San Diego, it is a good choice. It is close to beaches and has good access to freeways if going other places. I think it is very centrally located for a San Diego vacation. Rooms (3*) because they are nothing to get excited about (imho)....pretty standard room...two queen beds, desk, chair, TV, drawers for clothing, standard bath....tub/toilet separate from vanity, nice large closet. The negatives about the room...NO coffee pot!!! I thought that coffee pots were almost standard in all hotel rooms these days. They did have a \"coffee cart\" near the lobby that we walked to for coffee in the morning.....muffin and 2 coffee's were $11..The other negative was the fact that there is no \"window\" to allow fresh air. There is the \"old\" wall air conditioner/heater/vent units.....very NOISEY!!! The nobs were not on this particular one, so there was no way to adjust the heat level. The only way to allow fresh air was to leave the door open, or have the noisey fan running. The other negative was that there was no way to turn the porch light off. Because of the door/window set-up, this allowed quite a bit of light to shine into the room along the edge of the curtains....enough to be distracting all night. I am sure they have these lights stay on for safety reason, but I like dark room to sleep in. Service (4*) as the staff that we dealt with was very accommodating and we were able to get into our room early. Value (3*)....I did not mind the price that I got using the \"no name \" service...but I HATE being stuck with a $25 parking fee!!!! My biggest pet-peeve for hotels these days...and the thing I complain about all of the time....just charge more for the room, please...this is considered nickle & dimeing me, and having what I consider to be \"hidden fees\". (OK, so maybe I am old-school...but I still don't like it!!!) Would I \"chose\" to stay here?

I will post pictures too at a later date, I took a lot of pictures of the place just for TA. So here's the (long) review: I booked my family (2 adults and 2 children) into the Paradise Point Resort in March 2009 - I came across their website through my searches for beachfront properties in San Diego, and there was a 48 hour online sale ($207 a night for a bayside 1br bungalow suite). It seemed like a great deal, especially with a full bay view, and a great location, so I booked it right away. The website showed a beautiful resort and rooms. Then I started reading the reviews and got worried, but I was still getting a really good price for a bayview room. I called the resort to ask some questions and raise my concerns about what I had read in the reviews. I called the 1-800 number, the reservations desk forwarded me to the concierge (thinking I wanted to ask questions about activities at the resort). The concierge told me that he would get the manager to call me back and talk to me - the manager (Joe) called me within 10 minutes. I expressed my concerns about the reviews I read (cleanliness, bugs, condition of rooms), he told me that while the rooms are older, the rooms were clean. I asked about the parking costs and he reduced it from $22 a day to $12 a day. I asked a few more questions and felt comfortable with his responses. We stayed at Paradise Point Resort from March 12 to March 19. I've tried to put all the details that we experienced while staying in this resort in this review, so it's really long... We arrived in the evening, around 8:30pm. When we arrived, there was one person at the front desk, and the lobby was empty. He was courteous and friendly and checked us into our room. He also gave me a card (it was a birthday greeting card from the resort, I mentioned that it was my husband's birthday when I called to ask questions). The front desk clerk (Jarrod) mentioned that the manager (Joe) had put us in one of the nicer bayside bungalows. The bellman showed us to our bungalow (he drove a golf cart and we followed him in our rental car). He opened our door for us and helped us with our luggage. We had bayside bungalow #542 (3rd from the last one on the street). The first thing the we did was whip out our cameras and take pictures of everything so I could post it in this review :) The 1br bungalow was clean, bright and really nice. The bar/kitchen area had a mini-fridge, sink, microwave, and coffee maker with complimentary coffee. There was a side table and metal ice bucket too. All were clean and ready for use - just note that it was more of a bar area than a kitchen. There are no utensils, or cooking things, or dishes, nor do they advertise it as such - we knew what to expect, so we came prepared with disposable cutlery and dishes and paper towel. The dining/living room area was nice and open, dining for four, with a large patio window overlooking the cove, two chairs and one ottoman in the living room area, storage coffee table with some magazines on top, two side tables with lamps, and a double sofa bed. There was an older but functional tv in a cabinet with drawers in the living room, and a similar set up in the bedroom. The drawers were clean. There was a newer wall air conditioner/heater unit in the living room and in the bedroom. The bathroom was an interesting design - there were two sink areas with large countertops (one in the bedroom, one in the living room) sandwiching the toilet and bathtub which had doors on both sides so that it was accessible through the living room or through the bedroom, and there was a big closet next to each of the sink areas, with two luggage stands - we could have used more hangers, but we made do (I didn't call and ask for more). The bedroom was big, with a king sized bed (nice bedding), and small bench at the foot of the bed, night tables, digital clock radio, phone, and lamps. The sink areas and kitchen areas were well lit, the bedroom was only lit by the side table lamps, the dining room and living room had adequate lighting, and the toilet/bathtub area had dim lighting with noisy fans. Everything was clean, I did check the corners and base mouldings (from reading one of the reviews), and they could have been cleaned a little better, but they weren't filthy. The carpet was clean but older. The distressed furniture style and mismatched furniture style doesn't quite match - it doesn't match the nice granite kitchen and sink countertops, or the crown moulding and chair railing, or the bedroom linens. The toilet and bathtub are old but clean. The towels were white, we had enough for 4 - they weren't very soft and plush because they're the ribbed kind, but they looked newer. There was gel soap bars in the sink areas and an oatmeal soap bar for the bathtub, as well as shampoo, conditioner, and something else (either lotion or body wash). Outside the front door we had a great view of the bay, and we had two outdoor chairs and table. The buildings are older, but we felt pretty good walking into our unit and checking it out. While we were taking pictures, we received a phone call. It was a clerk from the resort, welcoming us and asking whether everything was to our satisfaction. We mentioned that one of the bedroom lamps needed a new lightbulb, and within 5 minutes a maintenance man came and replaced the bulb. The sofabed is not very padded and you can feel every spring in it - it sagged in the middle a little, too - when I had asked the manager about it when I called the month prior (I saw some reviews mention how uncomfortable the sofabed was), he did mention that they could bring something to pad it more for us if we wanted. I would have called to ask for that, but the kids didn't once complain about it, slept well throughout the entire trip, and the only complaining was more about who was hogging more of the bed. I don't know how they slept on it - I tried it out just to see, and there was no way I would have had a comfortable sleep on it - but it worked for them. Our king sized bed was really comfortable, I slept really well all week. Bugs - I did find a centipede crawling on the air conditioning unit in the bedroom on our first evening, but we didn't see any other bugs in the unit until after our 3rd day there. It isn't surprising, though - by that time we had walked on the beach and tracked in some sand, we were using the kitchen area and had fruit and food items there, and we bought firewood to use in the firepits in the evening and they were inside behind the front door - plus, when housekeeping comes to clean, they leave the door open because they leave their cart outside while they clean. All in all, in 7 days, we saw 1 centipede, 3 spiders, and around 30 ants - the first time we saw some ants on the ceiling in the kitchen area (after day 3) - I left a message for housekeeping about it and they cleaned the walls, ceiling, floors, etc (it was pretty evident that they did). the next couple of days there weren't that many ants, just a straggler here and there, but then my kids found a bunch of them crawling on the floor in the closet where we kept all our shoes - which is why I suspect that we tracked them in with our sandals and slippers from the beach. I left a message for housekeeping to please clean the closet areas, and they did. Usually I'm quite phobic about bugs, but these were tiny little ants and they didn't really bother me - the spiders were small house ones. The kids actually enjoyed finding the ants in the closet. Our unit was a short walk to the nearest firepit on the beach in the cove, so it was a bit of a chore to lug the heavy patio chairs to and from the firepits as well as the firewood and supplies, but it was better to be where we were because it was a quieter unit being closer to the end and not being directly in front of the firepits and beach. We bought our firewood from the nearest Von's (the Island Market was selling firewood at just over double the cost of Von's), but we bought the Smores kit from the Island Market for $22 because it included the long wood sticks to cook the marshmallows. We enjoyed an open fire for three of the nights that we were there - the kids had fun playing on the beach in the dark and making Smores. They even caught some tiny baby fish or shrimp (not sure if these were baby grunions) the size of the eye of a needle when they scooped up water from the shoreline. We didn't have a problem securing the closest firepit on all three occasions, even though the entire resort was booked (and the firepits technically are public use). Each unit only has 2 patio chairs, so I called housekeeping and asked them for two folding chairs - the fellow who came couldn't find any but brought me two conference type chairs to use - they were just fine, and we kept them for the entire trip to use out on the beach. Our unit was also directly in front of the tennis courts and bike rental place, so we just walked across and rented a quad bike for just over half an hour and biked around the resort - the kids really enjoyed that. We used the main pool once, in the evening - there's not much lighting, and to me the pool didn't seem very warm, I was freezing, but my kids didn't seem to have a problem and happily swam about for over an hour. We did find one of the filters had come off and notified one of the maintenance crew. I didn't use the hot tub because there were a bunch of young adults using it (being spring break), but it seemed really nice. We got to the main pool by calling the front desk and asking them to send a cart over to our unit - it arrived in just 2 minutes. The walk from our unit to the pool wasn't really far, but in our slippers and suits at night it was better to hitch a ride. We also got a ride back from the pool. When we were dropped off my door key card stopped working, luckily we were able to flag the cart driver to let us into our unit - the next day we got new key cards. I called to ask for robes, and they brought us two large fluffy robes to use (only one size, XL), they were really warm and comfortable but they were really old and showed their wear. We hung out on the beach in the cove for one day for a couple of hours. The kids had fun playing in the sand and exploring the rocks down the way, looking for little crabs. The sand did have a lot of broken sea shells, and my daughter found a piece of broken glass, but other than that everything else was fine - the kids were running around the beach barefoot and didn't seem to have any problems. It was really nice being so close to the beach and cove from our room, we had leisurely breakfasts looking out at the view every day. SeaWorld is just a two minute drive from the resort. We decided to walk the distance - it just seemed so silly to be so close and drive two minutes to pay another $10 in parking and then have to walk in from the parking lot. My kids are 10 and 6 - and with a bag full of lunch, snacks and water, and a bag with warmer clothes for the evening, we walked from the resort, across the little bridge on Ingraham Road that separated the resort from SeaWorld, and up to the front of SeaWorld - it took us 15 minutes door to door each way. The walk was actually really nice because we walked pass Ski Beach and park, took in the view, we got to look down at some boats and fishermen when we were walking across the bridge, as well as some birds, and before we knew it we were there. On the walk back, we chatted about all the things we saw at SeaWorld, and it really made the time pass quickly. There's a view tower near the lobby and pool, we went up there on our last day, you can't really see much through the bars at the top, but on each stair landing you can get a good view of the pond and the pool. The spa is next to the main pool, the treatment costs are really extravagant, we didn't try any. We did not try out their restaurants since we bought food to eat in, and also ate out of the resort. We didn't have time to try out the mini golf, either, but we saw a lot of people out enjoying it. We also saw people enjoying the tennis courts, too. We checked out early in the morning, there was one person at the front desk, the lobby was empty again, and she printed out my receipt and that was it - she didn't ask me how my stay was, but was friendly and courteous. All in all we had a fabulous stay, all the staff were friendly and helpful and met our needs every time, housekeeping cleaned our room well every day and met all our requests (extra towels, extra coffee). I can only comment on the 1br bayside bungalow that we got (room 542) - and although it does show its wear in places, some parts of the room were updated and the overall atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing, and it was very functional for us. I'm really happy that we experienced this resort and even happier that our experience was one of the good ones. One note - as much as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and experience at Paradise Point Resort, I would say we got our money's worth (based on the price we paid) - I wouldn't have stayed there for full price, and after looking at the rest of the resort, I definitely wouldn't stay anywhere but in a bayside 1br bungalow - the whole point was to have the view and the beach, the other areas seemed gloomy and backed onto parking lots, roads, and other units. And I agree that the parking fee is unnecessary and should just be incorporated in the cost of the room, but I was satisfied with a discounted rate, better than nothing! I also think that they should just have a shuttle to SeaWorld, it's sooooo close!", "Date": "August 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cParadise it is not!\u201d", "Author": "SL01", "ReviewID": "UR38393375", "Content": "We stayed at Paradise Point Spa & Resort Aug 14-16, 2009. .

My daughters allergies went crazy immediately. We called to see if we could change rooms, but were told they were full that weekend. At the pool, we had to call twice for clean towels, and after speaking to others, they too were disappointed in the quality of the room.

The diner who ordered a bagel and cream cheese had to send it back as it was burned black. When a new one was brought out, two of the diners had already completed their meals, and the cream cheese was missing. Another of the group of four did not receive his eggs as he had ordered, there is quite a difference between poached eggs and eggs over easy.

The girls at the Front Desk are exceptional. Prior to our arrival I had the pleasure of talking to Renee, I was very concerned about all the negative reviews I was reading and she was very honest and assured me that we would have a great time, and WE DID.... Thank you Renee you're the BEST!!!! We were then escorted to our room, full of all this negative anticipation from the reviews we read we pleasantly surprised. Our room had a King size bed, a sofa with a pull out bed, a desk, Granite Counter tops in the Bathroom with two sinks, a tub/shower with a new shower curtain (not like we read that they were old and smelly) with a cloth interior shower liner which I personally prefer so you don't get attacked by the plastic ones, an in room safe, and iron and ironing board, plenty of closet space, a small refrigerator, and no one on top of us since they are all single story units which is great... but NO COFFEE POT in the room... :-( We had a front patio and the other rooms on either side of us had rear patio's which was nice when you sat outside you had some privacy and so did your neighbors, we did NOT ever hear anyone else from the other rooms and we did have neighbors. We were in the Orchid section which had a nice view of Mission Bay, and we even had the opportunity to see a SKUNK, wow they are beautiful...but then we went in our room :o) We chose to use the smaller pool which was right around the corner from our room, it was nice and quiet with a beach entry, towels are available at the pool for your use, there is a hot tub as well as torches and fire pits for evening relaxing. This Resort is amazing the landscape is something else, the landscapers have some job to keep this place so immaculate, every day they are vacuuming the streets, blowing out the falling leaves, trimming the shrubbery, what a job and it shows, it's truly beautiful. We were very close to Sea World if you were a walker you could even walk it, but we drove it's just over the bridge, we didn't eat in any of the restaurants or got to the Spa, what was I thinking?, so we can't tell you much about them other than they look nice from the outside. We had 2 minor problems, someone took our parking space and since they are assigned we were concerned about parking, the Front Desk immediately offered us alternate parking, the other problem was one day we were not provided towels, let me tell you in less than 5 minutes someone was at our door with warm hot towels. The Staff is exceptionally helpful and attentive to your every need. The one thing that we did not care for was the $22.00 per night parking fee, personally I think that's a lot $10-12.00 would be acceptable to me but every hotel is doing it so you can't get away from it, just hope you don't have a parking spot near the sprinklers. Pack your bags, go and have a great time and by the way, someone posted a photo of a piece of furniture that looked like it was painted and the paint was peeling off, well the motif of the hotel is that distressed look so it's suppose to look like that.

After viewing the resort's website, my expectations were high, as we booked an ocean view suite and our brother and sister in law with their beautiful little girl booked a room near the lake. Driving into resort it almost felt like we were in Hawaii. The greenery, the lakes, the fire torches gave perfect touches to this small 'paradise' so close to home. Upon checking in we were given our key to a little bungalow on the beach, Room 541, and a certificate for complimentary desert at Baleen, a restaurant on premises. The room was towards the end of the resort and had an amazing view of the ocean. There were two lounge/beach chairs in front of the door and ducks roaming around. My son definitely enjoyed looking at them. The room itself was average. It had a bedroom with a King size bed that was comfortable and sheets were very clean. There were connecting bathrooms with two sink areas sharing a shower in the middle. The shower showed signs of wear and tear; however, the water pressure was excellent. Clean towels were also provided. The living room area had a pull out couch, two arm chairs, a futon, a small round table with 4 chairs and a small kitchenette with a sink and a microwave. Overall condition was average, but clean. When we first walked in there was a smell of moisture, however, once we opened the door and let some fresh air in and sprayed Fabreze, the smell was no longer noticeable. Our first night there we decided to have dinner at Baleen, a restaurant on premises serving above average priced food. The staff at Baleen were very accommodating, especially with our two babies - high chairs were provided. The food was a little disappointing. I had ordered a salmon dish, but it had a weird BBQ sauce and another flavor I couldn't put my finger on. The server gladly exchanged my dish to Seared Ahi Tuna - it was finger lickin' good. Other people in our party ordered Rib eye steaks, Chilean Sea bass and Lobster Tails - they were satisfied with the portions and taste. We ordered our desert to go and enjoyed it back in our suite. It was chilly that weekend, but the fresh air was very crisp and refreshing. The next morning everyone in our party decided to order breakfast in and enjoy it with the view of the ocean. This was perhaps the worst and the most disappointing service me or anyone in our party has ever received. All of us pretty much ordered egg dishes (how hard is it to make eggs?). It took us 4 phone calls and an hour and 15 minutes to track down and receive our breakfast. When the breakfast finally did arrive it was cold and missing butter for our toast and a large pot of coffee (they did deliver the creamer). We called the room service and spoke with Patricia number of times regarding the condition of our breakfast and the missing items. SHE offered a refund and we accepted. The missing items never arrived and we decided to let them know at which point she stated in a not-so-pleasant-customer-oriented tone that 'were were the ones who requested a refund and shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be getting the rest of the items\". This was absolutely not true and simply an unacceptable way to deal with customers. Although we did receive our money back, it wasn't what we were looking for. We wanted a nice, relaxing weekend with good service but it was cut short after our breakfast incident. We checked out right away with disappointment. I MAY recommend this to a friend, but definitely not the room service. I have placed a phone call to the Service Manager, but have not received a call back.

I think that is also dependent on your neighbors no matter where you stay. We loved being able to step out of our room with our daughter to go play in the sand and watch the beautiful sunsets! It also had the convenience of a small kitchen that had a small fridge, a microwave and a full sized coffee pot. We bought our own drinks and snacks. The employees were all very cordial and accommodating. The restaurants had great food. The barefoot grill had a wonderful atmosphere with a great view on the bay. Kids enjoyed feeding the fish and the frequent visits from the seagulls. We knew it would be pricey to eat on the grounds. The hotel IS overpriced overall. The $22 parking fee was no surprise thanks to the other reviewers and when we were checking out other hotels in San Diego, most of them had a $20 parking fee. We were taken by the hotel tax! In summary, this a great place to get away from it all and be with your family. I suggest staying in a studio or bungalow, if feasible, to get a better room judging from the other reviews. Staying on the water is expensive no matter where you stay in San Diego and there is certainly no real value here. Being on the water was a priority for us and this place met our expectations.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "RI", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, Great Location, NOT A 4 Star Resort\u201d", "Author": "mattpine", "ReviewID": "UR28511857", "Content": "Paradise Point is a nice hotel.

The cost of the room is just that, the cost of ONLY the room. EVERYTHING else you do at the resort will cost you money. If you have a rental car, it will cost you to park it at the resort. If you want to use the fitness equipment, it will cost you. If you want to play a round of mini golf with the kids, it will cost you extra.

We wanted a water-facing room with easy access to a nice beach--and was able to get a good 30% off deal one of the Bayside bungalows because we stayed 3 nights. I read through a lot of the reviews, and I can see why this resort gets such a mixed reaction. First of all, the place is HUGE and you know that they have to fill a lot of rooms in order to cover the operating costs. I'm sure that's why there are a lot of priceline opportunities---but beware as there is a vast difference in the set up of accommodations for each price point. If you're not specifically paying for a standalone bungalow (lagoon or bayside), then you're likely in something of a motel like structure with cramped patios right beside each other. Even the bunaglow are pretty close together, and your neighbors can really impact the quality of your stay. The front grassy area and firepits are all shared. This would actually be nice if you had a couple families traveling together. The view from the bayside bungalows as represented on the website are artfully misleading. It is not nearly the hidden away paradise you think---across the bay is a lot of traffic along a busy road. Having said that, the cove waters are very calm and great for young children to splash around in (although the signs warning you of potential high bacteria count does give you pause). From the cove you can see the Sea World fireworks at night which is a nice bonus. The bunaglow itself was well appointed. It was great having a separate living area so that while preschooler napped or went to bed, you could read/watch TV/talk/relax on the patio. There were two separate bathroom sink areas on either side of the main bathtub/toilet room. Housekeeping was difficult to schedule if you didn't want your room cleaned on their usual scheduled rounds--as in it didn't happen one day. Again, the size of the place probably really hurts their ability to provide flexible service. One of the best tips I can give is to bring your own snack food and bottles of water. Our bungalow had a little kitchenette with fridge, and it is way more convenient and cost-efficient to bring goodies yourself. Our stay contained both weekdays and a Saturday. The pools are really lovely but do get extremely crowded on the weekend. Even the ancillary pools that were practically empty during the week were jam packed on Saturday. Thank you tripadvisor reviews as we knew to stake out our pool deck chairs early on in the morning! The spa is not quite at the level it should be. I had booked a month in advance one of their signature treatments (Javanese Royal Treatment). The treatment itself was great. However, they had no lockers available when I got there (I guess the fitness center shares lockers with the spa...but geez, I had pre-booked a couple hundred dollars worth of services and they can't set aside one?), they had failed to tell me when I booked that my therapist would be a man (doesn't bother me, but I think some women might not be comfortable), and the toiletries were pretty sub-par. The on-site Barefoot Bar & Grill is OK. Prices are a bit high, but the setting is really nice by the water. Food service by the main pool is nice, but they don't serve breakfast. The resort itself is lots of fun. Ducks and fish to feed (best thing we brought was our own loaf of bread--although you can buy duck and fish food at the gift store), covered cycle carts to rent, miniature golf, nice pools. We had planned to not leave the grounds during our entire stay and we were never bored. So in summary: if you are willing to pay more to stay in one of the bungalows, are prepared by bringing your own drinks and snacks, and don't expect too much in the way of luxury, this can actually be a really nice family getaway. Stay away from weekends if you can. I would NOT consider this a good place for a romantic getaway.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cgreat location, needs remodeling\u201d", "Author": "dsnbs", "ReviewID": "UR27924468", "Content": "Great location, the grounds were very nice, but some of the buildings needed repairs as well as some of the sidewalks.

Our room was nice but musty and the air conditioner wasn't great - it seemed like there was some kind of humidity problem in the room and I don't really want to think about what kind of mold might have caused that smell. I didn't see any, at least. The pool is great - well heated, with a really shallow, almost beach-like side that is perfect for under-4, can't-swim kids, while still offering a lot of space for big kids to swim and splash. The location is fantastic - only minutes from great SD beaches, minutes from Sea World, minutes from the airport (which is noticeable when the planes fly over during the day). But it's an interior part of the bay, so the beaches at the resort itself are a bit stagnant - no waves, and it was slimy when we were there. The concierge recommended the perfect seafood restaurant with a kid-friendly menu. Next time we go, we'll try the miniature golf and the croquet, and maybe check out the bike rentals. We didn't do the s'mores special (the firepits are on the resort's beaches), but even though it's pricey, it was tempting anyway. We ate breakfast at Barefoot, out on the deck, and it was typical hotel breakfast fare at typically expensive hotel breakfast prices. They're pretty good about controlling the birds out there, and hotel staff were feeding the fish in the pond by the restaurant, and let our kids help - which was probably the highlight of their stay. Oh yeah, and they charged us $22 to park there, which I thought was a bit rough considering that the rooms are scattered all over the place, not in one big building.

After all, I pricelined it and you get what you get and can't get a refund. I believe the average price of this resort lies somewhere between $160-200 per night for a standard room. We got a standard room. However, the priceline price was for $70 a night, add in the $22 a night the resort charges and we got our room for $92 per night (not including taxes, fees, yada yada yada). I thought that was a fair price all things considered. I consider myself a fairly well seasoned travel for my young ripe old age of 34. I have stayed in a lot of resorts & hotels. Here is my breakdown of this place: The room: We received a standard room, with 2 queen beds, 2 sitting chairs & 1 table (awkardly long & placed strangely in the room). There was a small refrigerator in the room, a coffee maker, hairdryer, iron & ironing board. The refrigerator & television were housed in the armoire, along with the coffeemaker. You receive soap for your face, soap for your body, shampoo, conditioner & body wash. The towels are a bit rough. They are not soft towels, I did not like them. The refrigerator did not have a door on the little freezer compartment that is in the refrigerator & the side bar inside was broken off so we could not stick anything in the side of the door. I noticed those weird \"wood bugs\" crawling around on the inside of the armoire...ok....eek. The shabby chic thing is not working for the room decor. It looks trashy & yucky. Rooms are in need of a paint job & new furniture. The walls were dirty. I always look at the walls, the baseboard & the corners of the floor in the bathroom areas of hotels to determine if they properly clean and this one failed. Yuck. The maids really need to do a better and more precise job of cleaning. The bathtub was oddly retiled over or something. It definately needed an upgrade as well. Upon walking through the door of our room the \"tack board\" (nails and all) were exposed where some of the carpet was torn up right along the edging of the carpet against the door. Our young daughter stepped on this more than once when she would walk up to look out the window. Rooms need: new furniture & the hotel needs to dispose of their ugly shabby chic design, it's just not working here! Can we get some nice bathrobes in the room for guests to use? This place is supposed to be a 3 1/2 star resort, come on...act like one. The beds were comfortable but I just felt like the room needed to be cleaned or something... As a side note I broke out in hives while staying here. I have no idea what type of detergent is used in the bedding, etc. I tried at the front desk and they could not reach the housekeeping manager so they gave me her phone #. But when I call I only get voicemail. Other incidentals: Charging for parking? come on! $22 for a parking space. Do you know that customers do not like to be nickeled and dimed to death? Just incorporate the parking charge into the price of your daily rate, how hard can it be? Front desk staff: very nice but both times I visited (to check in and check out) there was only one person working and there was at least a 10-15 minute wait to be helped. Seemed like the one person working up there was overwhelmed both times and had no back up? Pools: We visited the main pool on one occasion. Very nice. Has a little beach/sand area and a shallow area for the little ones to play in. Was not overcrowded at all when we were there. The main pool is the only pool out of the 5 pools on the resort that is heated. The other pool areas looked nice, some have big gas flame heater things that they turn on at night. Grounds are lovely. Nice landscaping, you can go for a stroll along the pond or through the resort. It's nice to have a place to roam. I loved, and so did my daughter, all of the ducks in the duck ponds. There are tons of places, gazebos, sitting areas, to sit and lounge and be by yourself. The lobby itself is nicely appointed and HUGE...lots of places to sit, fireplaces, etc. Some people stated in other reviews that if you get a room too far back in the resort it can be a long walk to get from point A to point B. Not neccesarily. I didn't find it difficult to get from one end to another. But then again I love walking. The resort is within walking distance to the beach. The beach was nice & clean. The only issue I found were there was lots of shards of seashells that if stepped on could feel like little pieces of glass but I never cut my foot. There are about 10 firepits on the beach for guests to use, however you have to buy your wood elsewhere or buy it from the marketplace on the resort. We did not eat at either of the restaurants. I did buy items from the resort market place. A little overpriced but not terrible. I bought a San Diego coffee mug for $8, mango sugar lipglos for $4, newspapers, huge bottles of water are $4. Some of their clothing & other tourist items are way expensive, you can probably get those things elsewhere for less if you care to . There is a little coffee cart right outside of the market place where you can get muffins, bananas, lattes, etc. I had a cappuccino frozen latte $7.50 ( a little spendy) but hey, what the heck...indulge a little right? All in all this is a very nice property. I am assuming that the more deluxe rooms/suites are decorated much nicer and are much cleaner than the \"standard\" rooms. At least I would hope so for the price some people pay to stay here! Not me, I priceline if I can. I was also a little surprised at the lack of character of some of the buildings, some had these goddy looking structures over the doors (see my photo). I still liked the resort, I just wish they'd do some more upgrading.

Their executive suites, as it turns out, double as meeting rooms. You first walk into a big meeting room - with a collapsable wall that separates another \"executive suite.\" In that room, there is a small dingy couch about 20 feet from a really small tv, a very small table and a couple of chairs.

The kitchenette would be fine enough for a meeting...but not for using on a personal level. In the back is a very dark, small bedroom (two small windows out to bushes left it 100% dark) and a nondescript bathroom.

The Barefoot restaurant is a bit pricey for the kind of food it serves, but it beats driving off property. The fish and sharks in the surrounding pond are a definite plus, especially if you buy the food to feed them from the market. Seaworld is literally right around the corner, but a bit far for walking.

The 2nd bedroom only had access to the suite via the 1st bedroom. Otherwise, you had to walk around the outside of the building. The suite was not close to the Ballroom, you had to walk the entire length of the row of condos via the drive and then hike through the parking lot. The suite had a kitchenette, but it was not furnished with any dishware or towels or any pots, pans, utensils. I had to call housekeeping to get glasses and cups and dishware. I had to go buy papertowels and dishwashing soap and other accessories. It did come with a small microwave, undercounter frige (no ice cube tray) and coffee maker. Housekeeping was very accommodating but only brought items specifically requested, including 2 hand towels to use as dish towels and wash cloth. I also requested maintenance come to replace the air filter. The dust clogged the filter and hung down from the ceiling mounted air vent in long tendrils. The flow of A/C was hampered by the clogged filter. Maintenance never did come onsite during our weekend stay. The suite fronted onto a lagoon that while quaint did not look well maintained and had newspaper floating in it. After visitors commenting on the newspaper, I found a branch lying on the ground and fished out the newspaper. The room itself was comfortable albeit dated. The bathtub was badly cracked and the porcelain had peeled off the interior, but they tried to hide most of it with a plastic mat. Lights were dim everywhere. No hooks for towels, just one towel bar over the toilet in the water closet. One annoyance was returning to the room at 11pm after the wedding only to find neither my nor my wife's keys worked. They worked at 6pm and were not placed next to any item that would have cancelled the programming. Had to call the lobby via my wife's cell phone to have them send out new keys while standing outside the room. The charge for parking was exorbitant - $22 per night for each car.

Overall, it's a nice place and very convenient to Sea World, but the place is just crying out for some renovations. The hotel and grounds are beautiful, but the rooms feel old and dilapidated. We originally had a Lanai Garden room with a King bed and a sofa bed. It felt very run down, old, small and although the room was clean, it just felt a little dirty. Definitely needs some updating. My kids (ages 10 & 7) complained (rightfully so) that the sofa bed mattress was really thin and uncomfortable. It was pretty worn out. I contacted the front desk and they were very helpful. We were moved the next day to a different Lanai room with two Queen beds which was much larger too, but not any better as far as the run down feeling. Nonetheless, we were a lot happier in the new room. Staff was extremely helpful, really went out of their way for us and were very friendly. A few other observations: -We ate at their Barefoot Bar & Grill for dinner and again for lunch. Service was really slow at night and a little better at lunch time. Food was a bit overpriced and the quality was sub-par, particularly for the price. The nearby restaurants in Mission Beach are much better and a lot more reasonable. -We rented a paddle boat and a motorboat from the marina and they were fantastic. Really helpful and the prices were reasonable. -We went to the \"Pro Shop\" to play tennis and found the courts to be pretty run down; the tennis rackets available to be borrowed were a joke. Old, beaten up, too small and in horrible shape. I think they were paddle tennis rackets. Also, the ping pong table was gone, so we couldn't do that either. -The main pool has a beach which is cool and it was pretty easy to get a drink. We were there in August - high season - and the pool was pretty clean and not very crowded. We got 4 chairs for the family pretty easily, which says a lot about the place. Two thumbs up for having lots of chairs at the pool. The other outlying pools were also relatively uncrowded and were great for kids because they are pretty shallow. -Proximity to Sea World was great. If you don't count waiting in line to pay the $12 to park at Sea World, you're no more than 5 minutes from the front gate.

As others have said the parking fee is a bit cheeky and not needed when a room is so expensive. The restaurant food ( Barefoot grill place) was fine, but again, they let themselves down. The outdoor furniture hadn't been treated, so the legs of the chairs and tables were rotting and the seats needed sanding and re-varnishing.

I have read the reviews here and have no idea where they are coming from. The pool at paradise point is one of my favorites. I have stayed here almost 20 years, and have never seen a \"weird greenish tint\" to it. In fact, the pool has just been remodeled over the past few years, and is absolutely breath taking. The main reason why I love Paradise Point is the landscaping. It's breath taking. Since this hotel is older, all the plants are full grown and absolutely magnificent. My favorite thing to do is to just walk around the hotel and explore and take in the scenery. (esp at night when all the torch lights are light...) If you are a fan of being able to explore and walk around your hotels, you'll like it here. And that beautiful San Diego weather just adds to the charm! The hotels may be starting to show there wear, but I would never compare them to a \"motel.\" anytime we have had a problem with the room (ie, one time our drain in the shower didn't work) someone came out that day to fix it. And, seeing as this hotel is on the beach, you can expect the usual wear from simply being near water. My only complaint is that since new owners, the place has started to cater to a different, less family oriented crowd. I def miss the old barefoot grill with the sand pit! ;) and the old breakfast buffet where the check ins currently are. But those reasons aren't strong enough to keep me away! Anyone who cannot see the beauty in this place needs to open their eyes. To me, this hotel is not like the usual cookie cutter \"corporate\" hotels. It has character.

If they're going to charge $400+ for a basic room, they need to step it way up on the condition of the hotel and the details. I gave it a 3 -- some things were above average and others way below. I would stay at the Hilton for the $ before we stayed here again. Coincidentally they're both owned by the same company now.

Gorgeous grounds -- very lush. We were given a credit for inconvenience and other issues -- see below. Shampoo and conditioner was very good. Good h20 pressure in shower. Bell men and staff were helpful, gracious and courteous, save for the kids club debacle. Neutral: We were woken up at 6:30 am every morning by maintenance, but hotel tried to make good with a discount. Food at the Barefoot restaurant was very average and expensive -- $15 + for very average eggs benedict. Limited menu. I didn't dare try Baleen for fear of being disappointed. Service was really good for one meal and then terrible the next -- we waited for 50 minutes for a club, burger and some soup and several other tables that were seated/ordered after us were served more complex meals first. $4 for kids pancakes wasn't too bad. We stuck to a couple of our favorite offsite restaurants for dinner, including the Crab Catcher. Rooms were very average for the price. Nothing luxurious and no view -- peeling paint in the shower, but linens were ok and beds were pretty comfy. Negatives: Main pool was disgusting -- we never used it. Dirty bandaids, food debris and ZERO visibility. Lots of extra people at the resort who had families/friends there and hung out on the beach around the firepit. Felt like Simpson family camping. We were looking for something a little more upscale than folks parking their SUVs with jetskis on the lawn in front of our room and inviting their extended families for a beerfest at the \"free\" beach. Kids club -- this is a service they offer and one of the reasons we chose the hotel. It was booked the first night and they told us we could call back the next day to book for the 2nd day. When we called the next morning, we were told we should have booked the night before because they didn't have anyone to watch the kids because we hadn't booked 24 hrs. in advance. If you're going to offer a service, make it a standing one. Additional $20/nt to park car on top of room rate -- NO WAY!?!

We just finished a two night stay at Paradise Point. It was my husband, our 14 yo daughter and me. First of all, we stayed in a Junior suite. This is a little pricier than a standard room but it is a larger room with a sitting area, a tiny kitchette area and a very nice bathroom arrangement. When I originally booked in early March the Jr Suite were pretty expensive so I decided to settle for the standard room. However I kept checking prices and the suites came down in price so I changed my reservation to the Junior Suite. The main reason I love Paradise Point is because our room backed up on to a lovely shaded green belt. We had a small patio with chairs. There was a pond near us and every morning I would drink my coffee, read the paper and sit on the patio while ducks would meander by. I just found it peaceful, tranquil, lovely and exactly what I look for in a vacation rest. I will agree that the rooms aren't 5-star quality. But this is a very old place and what the rooms are, is clean and comfortable. They are freshly painted and the decor is 'shabby chic' or maybe they are just shabby (?) but I really had no complaints. The room was clean, the bathroom was very nice with double sinks and granite countertops. The bed was comfortable and I slept wonderfully. My only real complaint was there were no instructions with the coffee maker. The first day I didn' use nearly enough water. The second day I figured it makes about 6-8 cups. I probably could have called to find out. We played the 18 hole putting green, ate at the Barefoot Grill and my husband and daughter rented a jet-ski and jet-skied around Mission Bay. We all relaxed a lot and in a very beautiful setting. I am a person who reads hotel reviews religiously, am very picky about where I stay and really thought twice about Paradise Point based on some of the reviews. But I think it comes down to what you really want. I've had San Diego vacations where we've stayed Downtown in a high-rise with all the moden conveniences and walked the Gaslamp up and back and took in a baseball game. Tons of fun. And I had this vacation where I sat on a patio, fed the ducks, did the daily crossword, enjoyed an absolutely beautiful parklike setting and just relaxed. Both were great vacations and both cost about the same. San Diego isn't cheap for any quality hotel but for what Paradise Point is, it is unique and we will definitely go back.

The cost is more expensive then an inland hotel, but it was the best place for us because of the young children that were traveling with us. We stayed in the bungalow again and were first put into a room that had little sand and mostly rock with a dangerous incline. My daughter is 4 yrs old and the other child with us was 6 yrs. so when i contacted the front desk and explained my situation they gladly switched my rooms. I was afraid they wouldn't be able to because we stayed during the 4th of July weekend and it was full, but they accomodated me and i wish i could remember that girl's name because she was very helpful upon check in and when i changed out the room! I probably won't do a 4th of July weekend again because there were too many people on the beaches during that weekend and Sea World was crazier than it usually is. It took us over an hour to enter Sea World because we went on the 4th! With the exception of one family who wouldn't allow us to share the firepit on the beach, we had excellent neighbors. Our kids played with each other and we all sat on the beach and talked and relaxed! This is the perfect hotel because the bungalows sit right on the bay so there is plenty of sand and water for the kids to play in. This is not the hotel if you're looking for an exceptional room. It's dated but comfortable. The sofa bed is definitely not comfortable at all, but even my sofa bed at home that is only a year old and rarely used is not comfortable. So we bring an air bed that sets up in a matter of minutes. Because of the young children we haven't tried dining out at their restaurant which i hear is pretty pricey but i have ordered room service and it's decent as far as room service goes. We love having the mini fridge and microwave in the room. We bought fruit for the kids to munch on and sandwich fixings and then had popcorn as we watched TV, which wasn't much! With the location and the weather you can't help but be outside! We took our own beach chairs since the ones on the patio are heavy and hard to move from the patio to the beach but our chairs fold are easy to transport. You have to come prepared to relax and the firepits aren't in front of every room...it's more like one to every four rooms, which we didn't have a problem until the one family said we couldn't share with them (my kids wanted to roast marshmallows) because another family was coming to visit them. I brought my 4 yr old inside crying but this was no fault of the resort. We could see the firepit from our window and their \"friends\" never showed up! But other than them, last year and this year we had no problems making friends! I like it better that way! But no one is bothering you unless you make contact...everyone is friendly, the housekeeping, room service and front desk personnel were all helpful and courteous and after 2 yrs there is no doubt that i would stay here again and recommend it to others!

We even left some things in the room, called from home, and they're shipping our stuff right away. (I didn't expect to see that stuff ever again.) Although housekeeping did not make us happy when, on our first night there, we found there was no bedding on the pull out sofa our daughter was to use. Housekeeping showed up 1 1/2 hrs later with sheets only. Then two ladies soon arrived with the pillows and blankets and made the bed for us. Thank god they didn't just drop the stuff leaving me to do their job and make the bed myself. This whole misstep kept our 6 y/o up much later than we'd planned. Not bueno. The room - all the rooms are spread out around this large property, like little bungalows. That can be nice/cute but it results in a whole bunch of walking to get anywhere. And due to the bayside location and inadequate ventilation, there's a severe musty smell which permeates the whole place, especially your room. But the bed was okay and the bathroom clean and adequate. The lovely wife had a problem with the half dozen or so spiders she killed. I think her bigger problem was with the ones that didn't show themselves and take their punishment like good arachnids should. We only ate at the casual Barefoot cafe, for breakfast. Pricey ($3.50 for coffee). After ordering oatmeal w/brown sugar and pancakes, it took us a long time to flag down a server to bring us the brown sugar and some syrup for the pancakes. It's very annoying when everyone at the table has to wait and watch their meal get cold while someone else is waiting for something that should have been there before the hot food was ever served. Ducks and birds all over the place. could be considered cute. But duck poop all over the joint. The lovely took a nap in the room, left the door open due to musty odor. We were all proud of her for kicking out the duck that wandered in without calling security! The pool has an odd green color to it. I think blue works much better for me. Except for the ponds they have with the scummy pondwater that looks like they've added Tidy-Bowl. That's the wrong blue. I'd never go back to PP. Why would anyone? Go to a KOA instead.

The nice aspects are tiki torches by the lobby and the restaurants, lush landscaping (particularly on Hibiscus lane), lagoon view rooms, and convenient access to the coast. Bikes can be rented for $10 hr/$50 day, there is croquet and miniature golf. There are 2 pools with waterfalls and another pool under construction. The marina rents power boats and sail boats. However, there is no beach, but a bay with views of apartments and freeways. There are no chairs provided to guests at the coast, who are left with option of taking the patio chairs from someone's bayfront room - without getting caught. There also is an abundance of pine trees - and a shortage of palm trees - by the shore which reduces the tropical vibe. The decor of the rooms are decorated based on a New England Hampton theme as opposed to a tropical theme. The red plaid couches, the colonial headboard and lamps and the (sparse) artwork on the walls all should be removed in favor of a tropical theme, like the rattan mirror and chairs in the rooms. However, I love the spacious bungalows! The bathrooms are marble palaces and the bath products are of spa quality. On Hibiscus Road, there are ducks in the lagoon in the day and skunks in abundance at night. Baleen is a 4-star restaurant, with a $40 price-fix menu to match, except the menu was limited to steak, seabass or quail.

We wanted to stay in a nice hotel that wasn't like a huge chain and felt special. I actually loved the resort. I loved the location because it's easy to drive to other places, but it still feels like a private resort. It didn't even feel like we were in a city. The entrance when you drive in is pretty as well as the lobby. At check in we asked to get an ocean front room, but they were all booked. We went to our room after check in and the room was nice. Small TV, but we weren't planning on really spending much time watching TV. We didn't really have a view except grass where you can walk around, but it was still a nice room. The room looks exactly like it does on the website. My main complaint is that the room had a strange smell and the beds were big, yet a little firm for my taste. Also, we ordered in room service and the food was okay. Not something I'd order again. I go the Ahi Tuna and it wasn't at all what i was expecting. My boyfriend got pizza and that was really good though. The pool's really pretty and heated which I liked. I'm basically giving this place 5 stars basically because the room is spacious and nice. The resort as a whole felt like Hawaii and we felt everyone was there for leisure as opposed to a place like a big hotel where it's a mix of business people and tourists. We wanted something special and a place that felt like a romantic getaway and we got that for the most part. We weren't expecting anything extravagant because we only paid 140 for the night.

The best meals we had were in the 5 star restaurant that was, unfortunately, a few years later converted into a banquet hall (What a bunch of idiots!) On our second stay the prices were higher (both food and room) and our only complaint was that the music from the live band at the restaurant was too loud in the evening (I think it was the Barefoot). Our third stay and the prices were higher again. The room service staff were pleasant and for the most part timely. The pool side restaurant had removed the spicy Buffalo wings from the menu (What a bunch of idiots!) and my wife had several minor complaints (can't remember what they were.) Her complaints were not being addressed, so, she asked to speak to the manager (don't remember the ladies name) and would you believe it, the manager refused to come out to the front desk to speak to my wife! Unbelievable! Our 4th stay in May '07 we had a larger suite with a double bathroom. I didn't like the location because it was next to the storm drain. Which is just an ugle eyesore, and what parent wants their kids playing next to an unsanitary storm drain? Incidently, the storm drain beach is the family beach where all the larger families stay because that's where the bigger rooms are. I have several complaints from our last stay. Maid service has definitely gone down hill; on one instance we asked for some sugar packs and ketchup and we got tissue and cotton balls--slight translation problem here? But my biggest complaint is smokers! Try and relax in a beach chair with a magazine and a great view while some idiot is upwind puffing away on a cancer stick! In the Baleen restaurant there were cigar smokers on the outside patio. So, we figured, \"well let's just eat inside.\" What a bad decision! All the smoke was blowing inside the restaurant!!

The internet site that I used to book this trip labels the property as a \"four-star\" resort. We are not picky travelers - we're very easy to please, but this was nothing like described. The first room we checked into had \"leftovers\" in the toilet, and a great deal of hair on the floor of the bathroom. The tub was dirty, and the non-skid surface of the tub was peeling up. The room smelled strongly of mildew, and the bed was very old and cheap for a supposedly \"upscale\" resort. To top it all off, the curtains would not fully close over the floor-to-ceiling windows, allowing a foot-and-a-half wide unobstructed view of us in our bed to anyone who cared to walk by. Since the room was filthy, we asked for a different room. Management complied by putting us in a room that was smaller, also smelled strongly of mildew, did not have adequate lighting to fully light the room, and the curtains still left a foot-wide gap through the windows. So, we went back to the front desk again. This time, the management gave us a suite that was, in their words, \"one of the best units on the property\". Being a one-bedroom suite, it was certainly acceptably roomy. But that's the best thing I can say for it. Even though it was a \"luxury suite\", the furnishings were still terribly cheap and uncomfortable. Exact same bed as in the two other rooms. Smelled just as strongly of mildew as the two previous rooms. Still unacceptably dirty (there was a a dirty plunger and several wadded-up pages of a newspaper on the stoop in front of our unit), but we just didn't have enough energy to complain anymore. The carpet was a worn, threadbare, indoor-outdoor carpet that was fraying along all the edges and along the seam in the center of the room. To top it all off, there is an additional $22/night charge for parking - which is not even covered, it simply gives you an uncovered (and undersized) parking space on the asphalt in front of the unit. In short, this hotel simply does not meet expectations. The grounds of the resort are OK, but the room quality is two-star at best. I'm not exaggerating - the rooms are along the lines of what I would expect to find if I stayed in a discount hotel along the side of a deserted highway somewhere. Which would be fine, had I paid a two-star discount hotel rate. Which I didn't. The \"discounted rate\" that I paid for this trip was more than what a legitimate three-star hotel costs at the full price. In fact, In the past I've paid less to stay at legitimate four-star hotels hotels in the San Diego area. Be warned - this property is old, run-down and until they give it a complete renovation there will be many other hotels in the area that can give you a better experience for the money.

The rooms were discounted for the affair for $259.00/night + taxes + parking( $10.00/night)= $ 311/night. The resort is spread out on 44 acres on Vacation Island which is situated in Mission Bay. The cottages are spread out through out the resort and village clusters are named for flowers: Orchid, Hyacinth, Eucalyptus, etc. Some of the pricier ones are located near the water or beach and some face the ponds. There is a tennis court, basketball court, putt-putt golf in some of the villages. The main lobby is separate and located in the middle of the entrance. You pull up to the curb ( if you have your own transportation) and check in, then a bell boy will lead you by golf cart to your cottage. If you take a taxi you will be loaded into a golf cart and driven to your room. Unless there are several lined up there is a wait unti they return. If youare adventurous you can walk with your luggage. The layout is confusing at first with the one ways and turns. The business Center is in the Paradise Ballroom which is in the same area as the Lobby but not connected to it...it is another walk.Near the Ballroom is the Barefoot bar & grill ( expensive) & the Baleen restaurant( open in evening). There is the Island Market for sundries,souvenirs same vicinty as lobby. The Main pool and Spa are located next door to the Market. There are three lawns to do your wedding, the Sunset, Paradise & Lawn point. The Paradise is the nice one with cement squares in the grass so you walk on something solid. It isn't as exposed but you have the Marina view it is more than the Sunset lawn with is on the opposite side of the Ballroom and is all grass also looking out to the Marina, more exposed so a little more windy and cooler( this is March remember and at 4:30 pm). Both are accessible to the ballrooms. Lawn point is smaller and tucked in near the Marina and Barefoot grill. You will do a lot of walking to get to the Main area or call /flag down one of the many golf carts driving around. Ice machines are located in one area of the village so if you are lucky to be near it Great! If not you have to walk to it. The rooms are not that great..we had a double bed so it was slightly larger than the King. I think the theme is distressed/tropical because the furniture looked like it was made to look scuffed and old. The amoire had a decent looking Tv and a small ref next to it, below a coffee maker with just coffee, no tea. and no plug near it..you have to move it to the bathroom to plug it in. The carpet looks clean but please bring slippers or you feet will be dingy.Smelled musty had to open doorwall but was missing the screen so we just pulled it open little so nothing would crawl in. The painted wooden lanai chairs on the patio were flithy we had to scrubb them before we sat in them. We faced the pond, nice with the ducks. Door mat had grass growing from it. The bathroom was marble tiled, pretty clean, had a hair dryer, ironing board was rusty and unbalanced when you opened it. The one thing was there little ants crawling on bed, bath counter, once inwhile the ref. It would have been nice to have complimentary bottled water in the room for the price you pay for the room. There is # parking for each room. We shared a common foyer with the room next door so you had to use your room key to enter and had a doorbell for each room. I got the same comment from the others regarding their rooms. The only room i saw that was nice was the one my daughter was in but she was the bride so she had one facing the water and it was modern, painted nice, clean had a living area and kitchenette, separate bedroom, and bathroom. This was probably a suite so must be pricey.

Their premier restaurant, Baleen, looked gorgeous...also on the water with a beautiful deck. Wish we had more time! The grounds are beautiful and, as the property is 44 acres, there are plenty of areas to walk and explore. Even though the resort was heavily booked, it never felt crowded. Wonderful espresso cart...best mocha ever, right next to the resort market..but only open until 11AM, I believe. Nice bird sanctuary area to relax with your morning coffee...or walk to the beach and enjoy it there. 4 separate pool areas throughout the property. 1 is for 18 and older only, another perfect for children, etc. We did not try the spa, will definitely use it next time. Also beautiful. Only recommendation I would make is to verify the type of room you want. When making our reservation we thought we were getting a room identical to what we saw on line after speaking with reservations, not the case however, we were not dissatisfied..we just didn't have an opportunity to enjoy sitting outside of our room as the front porch area didn't receive any sun.

The grounds are beautiful. Extremely spread out. Our room-nice king bed, with couch and two extra chairs, plus a desk and chair. Also had a wood armoire with TV and mini fridge. I liked the bedspread on the bed. It made me think more of home or a bed and breakfast rather than a generic hotel bedspread. Our fridge did not work. It lacked a temperature knob and wasn't even plugged in. There was coffee left for us, but no coffee pot. I'm sure we could have asked about the fridge and coffee pot, but it really didn't matter to us. You could definitely tell that the place was old. The last night we were there, the armoire door came off one of the hinges. It was a heavy door and I didn't want it falling off the other hinge in the middle of the night. We called the front desk and someone came to take the door off completely. It wasn't something that was a quick fix because the wood of the armoire was worn and old. Again, it wasn't something that concerned us cause we were leaving the next day. We did not have a car, but from what I understand, it costs $17-$25 to park your car. ( I don't know the exact number). The bar/grill at the hotel is WAY overpriced. We didn't want to eat there, but we were starving and didn't have a choice. The gym is located in their spa. The gym cost $10 or $15 but we had a reduced rate. Small gym, but they had what I needed. All of the machines are brand new. Each bike, treadmill and ellitical had it's own tv and they gave you water, headphones and a towel. The changing room was very nice as well. The grounds are very extensive and spread out. If you call the front desk, they will send a golf cart to take you to other places in the resort. You really need a car at this resort as there is no other place closeby to walk to. I don't feel as though the prices they charge for this place are worth it. They were charging $185. Considering that you have to pay to park, are limited on the food choices and that it is old, I think you could do better in the SD area. If you could get in this place for under $150, I think it would be ok. The proximity to Sea World is outstanding and that is one positive point. There are lots of restaurants within close driving distance. One other positive point is that the meeting and banquet facilities at this place are outstanding. The rooms and the restrooms are beautiful. Also, the staff was always very friendly. So, I give the 3 circles because we had some good and some bad with our trip.

The bell staff came right over and gave me a ride on their golf cart while my family followed behind in the van. Parked at the unit, a suite on a little cove, and the bellman took everything in. Suite was perfect for us, a living room with pullout sofa, nice little kitchenette with refridge/micro/sink and then a separate bedroom. No cracks, smells, etc. They had forgotten our cribs, so a quick call and three minutes later another cart pulls up and a man sets them up for us. The rest of the stay was very.

Upon arrival, we were taken to our room at what seemed like the farthest end of the hotel, adjacent to a main road (rooms 550-560).

It was about 63 degrees inside the room, and it was in the 70s outside. We turned the AC off and soon realized why it had been turned down so low. The room reeked of mildew. We noticed that the refrigerator was leaking and making a strange high-pitched squealing noise, so we shut it off and cleaned up the pool of water underneath it. As we were taking the top bedspread/quilt off the bed, we saw two large cigarette burn holes on it (in a non-smoking hotel). We immediately called housekeeping to get it replaced.

We would have even settled for a 3-star experience. Not the case. First off, their website clearly states that check-in is at 4 p.m but be prepared to wait. We were in line at least 20 minutes, only to be told by a manager that check-in was \"actually between 4 and 5\" and that checking-in just meant \"checking-in, not that the room was ready\". Our room was ready an hour later and we only knew that because we came back to the lobby to inquire about what was taking so long. Second, be prepared to spend a lot of $$$ on hotel services, some of which are not mentioned on their website. Parking is $20 per night for a spot in front of the bungalow. The \"free\" mini-golf course advertised on their website is actually $10 per person. The fitness center, basketball court, volleyball court and internet are also extra costs. The Barefoot Bar and Grill prices are also extreme ($13 for a drink???). Third, we had not housekeeping during our stay. We were out of our room for at least 8 hours in the morning/afternoon and came back to an untouched room. Fourth, the bungalow we stayed in was not 4-star quality. The room had a bed and breakfast type feel to it except the bed was hard as a rock. The in-room movie would not work and when we tried to check out through the hotel's TV system, we gave up after 3 tries and a call to the front desk. I hesitate to mention the plethora of children riding rented hotel bikes throughout the many parking lots on the wrong side of the road but it is definitely a safety hazard. The hotel claims it only rents to those \"18 and older\" but this was obviously not the case during our stay.

The grounds are absolutely beautiful and very tropical. It is quite a bit to get around within the resort but nothing horrible. We did enjoy walking and there is a great climate there. The staff was pleasant. We had a lagoon bungalow which was very nice and clean and very nicely furnished. Some of them did need some work on the outside. One problem that we did have is that half of the window was not covered by a blind or heavy curtain, only a very sheer curtain, which let in very bright sunlight early in the morning and made it very hard to sleep in if you wanted to. At night you had to be careful where you stood at the bathroom sink area because you could see right in. We wound up putting our comforter over the sheer curtain that was there to help get some privacy and block out the sunlight. The \"lagoon view\" that we had was filled with pond scum, which could easily be remedied with a pool skimmer. The ponds above the one that ran into ours were very clean, we were at the bottom. The pool area is beautiful but if you are trying to spend a weekend without the kids, the larger pool area, which has the bar area, was filled with children. If you want to have a drink, the adult pool does not have a bar area at all. We did have to contact the front desk 3 times to request a bellman because he didn't show up when we were leaving. When we finally decided that we would walk our luggage to the lobby building, he came as we were walking out our door. The Barefoot Bar and Grill has an excellent breakfast but I didn't care for their dinner. Very pre-packaged and not worth the money. Do prepare to spend $$ if you are staying there. Drinks and boat/jet-ski rentals are very expensive. I would highly recommend renting a car to get around but from what I have heard they charge $20.00 a day to park there. We rented from Enterprise, which works with the concierge. You do get a discount if you tell them you are staying there. Nice gift shop but very pricey.

After reading some of the reviews on here we were a bit worried that we had made a mistake, but we've stayed at places which have received mixed reviews before and always enjoyed ourselves. I am so glad that we went back as we had a great time. Reading some of the negative reviews I wonder whether we stayed at the same place! We are a family of four (mum, dad and 2 'kids' in our 20's) and so we had 2 rooms. We were pleased to discover that our rooms were within the same bungalow so we shared the same front door which opened into a small passageway and then our rooms were on either side. We had lovely views of one of the lagoons and we were right next door to the waterfall pool. The rooms were plenty big enough, with a king sized bed and a sofa in mum and dad's room and two queen sized beds and a smaller sofa in our room. We had mini fridges in both of our rooms which we always kept well stocked with food and drink - a trip or 2 to the nearby Vons saved loads on buying breakfast and lunch everyday. Our room also had a small sink area (aside from the bathroom) and a microwave - which was handy for popcorn on the beach in the evening! We liked the way the sink was separate from the main bathroom, allowing 2 people to get ready at once, rather than one taking up the whole bathroom! Speaking of the bathroom, we LOVE the complimentary toiletries provided, they smell great!! A few negative points were that the plumbing was quite noisy - we could hear when the other room was using the shower, and if both rooms had the shower running at the same time you lost water pressure. A couple of times we found that the maids had forgotten to replenish one of the toiletry items, if we wanted to we could have phoned to have them replaced, but we didn't bother. Yes, the carpets had probably seen better days, but given the type of resort you spend a lot of time barefoot or in flipflops and you don't take your shoes off before you come in the room so what do you expect? It certainly wasn't so bad that you didn't want to stand on it, they just weren't as clean as our carpets at home! I'm not going to complain about the cost of parking (mainly because it was included in our package from Virgin holidays!) but anyway, we are used to paying at hotels. Yes, it's an annoying added expense, but at least you get a dedicated space right by your room. What is really annoying is when people park in your space! As we had 2 rooms, we technically had 2 parking spaces next to each other, but one night we came back and found someone had parked their huge SUV not only in one of our spaces, but blocking both of our spaces! Please park where you're supposed to! We found the concierge to be very helpful, and even let us use his phone to call home when we mentioned that whilst using one of the phones in the lobby, the person the other end couldn't hear, and was there another phone to use. The grounds are beautiful and we always saw people tending to the plants around the resort. We didn't find the pool dirty like some have said - yes, there was the odd leaf etc, floating around, but surely that's to be expected with the amount of surrounding foliage?

I am an adult over 50 yrs old and came alone. I wanted a quiet place, where I could walk safely and enjoy to view of the bay or the beautiful landscaping. If I had been looking for night time entertainment I would have been disappointed, but I went for this atmosphere purposely. I also experienced some difficulty at check-in with the desk staff and the availability of the room. Originally after check in, I was disappointed in the room, this was due to the low light at 5pm which did not do the room any favors and my tired state. As the next day arrived the shabby chic room was exactly what I had expected. I did think the drapes could have better covered the windows but that is all. All rooms are bungalow-like and have a lanai looking out on gardens or lagoons or the mission bay beach. The evening I arrived I ate at Baleen, the chilean sea bass was excellent. On the point near Baleen there was a wedding being performed which could be seen from their patio area. What a sweet way to start a vacation. I talked to a few \"locals\", Paradise Point is a destination for California, Arizona and Nevada locals for weekend retreats. They arrive in their SUVs along with b-b-ques to party the weekend at the beach. One family had been coming to this area for at least two generations for weekend get-aways. They conveyed that the prices can vary widely for the accomodations and recommended shopping around for the best price. There are three very clean pools: one communal pool with 3 fantasic fountains (this one is very shallow), a childrens pool and an adult only pool. There is a secluded bar near the bigger pool. There is mini golf and multiple person bikes to be rented. The spa staff is knowledgeable and their offerings are wonderful. The pricing was about what I would pay in an upscale salon in Chicago, their spa was better than any of those Chicago spas. The lagoons have nice outcroppings with comfortable patio furniture which makes a great place for morning coffee and reading the paper. The concierge staff was extremely helpful at all times and have discounted tickets to some local events as well as specialty prices with taxi firms.

About a week prior to our trip, I called the hotel just to check on everything and the long hold cycle started again - I gave it 20 minutes and just called the hotel directly and asked for the manager. Sergio got on the line and appoligized for the problems and checked my reservation to make sure it was what we had thought. Yep, we were all in, including the 2 day Sea World Splash pass. On the day we arrived, we went to the bell stand to get our tickets. He told us that it was only a 5 minute walk at the most to get to Sea World from where we were standing with our 5 and 7 year old daughters. He gave us our tickets and said to come back the following day for the other tickets as they are bar coded and once issued cannot be replaced. That seemed fine - so off we went. While the back side of Sea World is more like about 20 minutes walking and piggy backing our children, to get to the front entrance it was closer to 40 minutes of walking. Once at the gate we gave the attendant our tickets and she said that was only good to get in my husband and myself - the kids were an additional $96 - I was sure that the bellman had made an innocent error, so I kept the receipt so that I could clear it up when we returned to our hotel that afternoon. I contacted the front desk once back in my room and they said that the Splash pack was only good for 2 adult tickets 2 days, not the 2 adults, 2 children that we had been told. I was really bugged, but thought what the heck - we are here now, we'll just get our tickets and buy for the kids The following day we went back to the bell station to get our final 2 adult tickets - we were told that there we no more tickets for us, because the 2 day Spash Pack is for 2 adult tickets only - total. Non of this maked any sense what so ever. 2 days is 48 hours - family is typically 2 adults 2 children To help us through our obvious irritation, we received 4 tickets to use on their property. The 4 tickets we good for 4 /30 minute sessions on their out door basketball courts.

Booked largest bungalow on beach, had two separate areas, one bedroom with separate vanity and closet, and Student slept on comfortable pull out and his own vanity and closet space. Toilet and bath was shared between the two rooms. Space is larger than it looks on the website. Kitchen unit had nothing. We bought plastic bowls, dish soap and sponge, cereal, milk, snacks, and ate breakfast in the room each morning. Maid and front desk staff were excellent. However, the bungalows were old, toilets back up occasionally (water only not sewage) causing water damage to be dried out and leaving musty smell. Decore nice, modern, and comfortable but the unit just smelled and felt a bit old, musty and damp (my husband didn't think it was noticable). I guess I prefer newer construction. But what can you expect from an updated resort right on the water? Water view, beach front, and gardens were spectacular. Great central location. Casual dining on site and for room service o.k. Student thought hamburger awesome. TV channels very limited, no plug in for playstation 2. Pools seem nice. The heated one was too cold but we spent some time in the whirlpool with everyone else. Good resort for families with older kids (7-16 probably ideal), adults on their own or sharing with other couples. Less expensive room options around the site as good as the beach option. Rent a minivan. Driving is easy to all attractions. Ask the resort for a reduced parking rate for longer stays. They are very helpful and keen to ensure you enjoy your stay. Meal Tips: authentic, inexpensive mexican food at Valentinos in Mission Bay; and, fresh Italian take out back to your room at Cafe Bella, Garnet Ave Mission Bay. See all Sea World shows and consider two day pass with backstage tour. Well worth it. Loved Legoland. Both Sea World and Legoland have huge, excellent play areas for young kids. You could spend several hours at these locations with toddlers and preschoolers so bring something to read. Carlsbad shopping outlet is great and close to Legoland. The mall has a Diner that has the best milkshakes! Las Americas is even better shopping south of San Diego (quick drive). Coronado bridge and beach great. Zoo fun (avoid the petting zoo, disappointing compared to local farms). We did not go to the wild animal park. Old Town is very quiet and nice. Great mexican food everywhere. Our four year old could not follow the walking tour (too boring) but my husband and our student thought it was great. The shops have interesting art and pottery, and unique imports.

The unit that we get has very large windows facing the bay with beautiful views. There is a sliding glass door that leads to the bay. Outside the slider you have your patio with chairs and small table, then grass, then the sand on the beach, then the bay. Inside we have a kitchenette with a small fridge, sink, microwave, storage and counter space. I can not tell you how wonderful it is sitting on those patio chairs watching my 2 year old and 5 year old playing in the sand together with sail boats and rowing teams passing by in the bay.

They have many other activities there like a minature putting green, swimming pool, boat rentals, etc. I can not believe this place is rated so low. I love it there. Yes, the furniture in the rooms are a little banged up, but I'll take that any day to get that relaxing bayfront view. The property is also situated on its own private island, so you are away from all the riff raff of Mission and Pacific Beach. There are no homeless or seedy people drinking alcohol & hanging around a public restroom next door like there is at Tripadvisors #1 rated Pacific Terrace Hotel. The rooms are not luxurious like the Pacific Terrace, but to me, nothing beats opening that sliding glass door to the bay, putting my feet in the sand and enjoying the sunsets and the beautiful relaxing views. It is very calming and that is what you need with two young kids. We always go off season so we feel like we own the beach as it is very quiet and not a whole lot of people around. At night, we build a fire in one of the fire pits that are situated on the beach in front of the units and roast marshmallows for Smores. The kids love it. My husband and I love it.

When our cab pulled up from the airport, the bell staff greeted us and loaded our luggage on a golf cart while directing us to check-in. The front desk staff were quite friendly to us, and the bellman who took us to our room was wonderful! We spent the whole first day exploring the resort - jellyfish season runs from February-April, so if you go any time outside that, you won't have jellyfish on the beach. We enjoyed looking at them, really. The harbor on site has rental boats, so we went out on the bay in a kayak one day and a sailboat a different day. The prices on these boats are quite reasonable - the power boats and waterski runs can get more expensive. We stayed from Monday night to Friday afternoon, so we had lots of time to look around this place (we did spend 2 full days at seaworld). The best part for my daughter really was the Barefoot Cafe - yes it is slow and pricey (I expect to pay too much at a resort restaurant, don't you?), but there is a waterfall and pond outside - the birds and fish are great, and there was even a huge lobster in there. I didn't have much company at meals because the girl kept jumping up to look at the wildlife - as did most of the kids there. If you hate kids, this is not a good place for you to eat! The staff was really friendly. I had read many reviews of this hotel before we went, so I was prepared for the grounds to be wonderful (they were) and the rooms to have some cosmetic issues (they did). Our room was really big, and the bed was comfortable. We had a coffee maker and a refrigerator - I never tested the TV as we were so busy. Room service breakfast was really quite fast! The housekeeping staff were not the best - when they saw I had used the coffee maker, they cleaned it, but forgot to leave more coffee and cups. Next day I left a note and there were no more problems. The room was clean, including the bathroom, but there was a bit of rust on the hinges, could use a coat of paint. The pools were not too crowded (this was spring break time and things were a bit more crowded on Friday when we were leaving). During the day there were lots of kids in the hot tub at the main lagoon pool, but there is an adults only pool with another hot tub if you want to avoid crowds and kids. Both of those pools are heated, as is the waterfall pool. There were plenty of towels (you are asked to leave them at the pool, so having a beach towel to wrap up in after swimming is a good idea), and the pools were as clean as any pool you are sharing with other people - better than the public pool in my town.

One was bigger,and had a walk in closet. My mother took the smaller room and my wife and daughter and I took the bigger one. The bed was reasonably comfortable, but the pull out bed that my daughter slept on was not due to a very thin matress.

To do anything, you have to walk outside and walk or drive to the facilities. So if you want to be overcharged for the room, charged extra for every amenity, and inconvenienced in accessing any of them, this is the place for you.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cIt was alright\u201d", "Author": "cliffwy", "ReviewID": "UR6796398", "Content": "The rooms were ok.

The photos we had seen online didn't actually do the place justice. We found ourselves surrounded by towering palm trees, huge flowering shrubs, natural-looking lagoons, ponds and fountains, with strategic patios on which to relax next to flowing waters. The curbside valets and bell staff were cordial and accomodating; however, our first nasty surprise came in the sumptuous lobby upon registering, when we learned that it would cost $20.00 per night-no exceptions--to park our rental car in front of our room--or anywhere on the property, in fact. The desk clerk informed us that this was clearly stated on their web site (news to us). With no other parking within a reasonable walking distance, we had no choice but to pay. This added another $100.00 to the cost of our five-day stay. After traveling since early morning, we were more than ready for lunch at 3 p.m. on the day of our arrival, and seated ourselves at the outdoor restaurant. Our hamburger and sandwich lunch with iced tea came to $50.00, (including a modest tip for modest service). We were even billed for refills on the tea! That was our first and last meal at the resort. The rooms are motel style. An inaccessable outdoor light shone through the door window all night long, making it impossible to truly darken our room. \"Shabby chic\" best describes the decor. This included the armoir holding the TV, fridge and our clothing, and shabby it was: the white finish was marred by nasty black marks at the base and appeared to be rotting in places. One drawer was askew, leaving nearly a one-inch gap above one side of the closed drawer, and using it was a chore at best. (With bilateral tennis elbow, I had to ask my husband to pull it out and push it back in.) The bathroom door molding was completely rotted away in places. The mirror over the single sink was lighted by two 52-watt bulbs (yes, that's 52)--good luck grooming with that kind of illumination. The weather that week was not conducive to lazing by the pool but , if memory serves, available television programming consisted of MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, Headline News, the Discovery and Disney channels, and the standard local network outlets --oh, and, of course, a pay-per-view movie channel; there was no channel listing on-screen or on paper; NBC had a distinct orange cast at all times; the audio interference was often so severe that it was impossible to follow the program. ABC was sometimes watchable, but often there was no picture. All of the channels featured annoying audio interference to varying degrees. We registered complaints the second, third and fourth days of our stay. \"Engineers\" came to our room twice to tell us someone was \"working on the problem\" but by the fifth and last day of our stay, nothing had changed. The concierge was available only to those standing in front of him. Calling on the phone meant sitting on hold until we gave up. and looked for other information resources. So, if you're thinking of a nice resort vacation at Paradise Point, be prepared to pay through the nose and be higly self-sufficient; don't be disappointed when your accomodations fail to be on a par with the lobby or the grounds.", "Date": "February 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cThe resort and some other hints\u201d", "Author": "ac6", "ReviewID": "UR6762691", "Content": "Just returned from a 7 night stay at the Paradise.

Keep in mind that anything the resort has to offer will come at a cost. Secondly, if you're expecting luxury, you'll be disappointed. I booked a room for 4 nights in January for my fiance and myself, so that we could get married on the property during our stay. That said, the grounds of the hotel are immaculate and masterfully kept. The rooms however are old, a bit out-dated, and would probably classify as \"rustic\" sooner than \"nice.\" I might go as far as to say \"cozy.\" The hotel is not for those who couldn't book their room at the Hilton but more for those who want a more secluded, outdoorsy, almost camp-like resort. The ammenities on the grounds are laughably expensive; the spa, the workout facility, the restaurants... there were too many alternatives in nearby La Jolla to spend money on the resort. There is a parking fee of $20 per day though the front desk charged us only $10 (due to the length of our stay). Other than that we were offered nothing special (which I found a bit odd considering the nature of our visit). We stayed in the \"Lanai Garden\" (base room) for 2 nights, then paid extra the last 2 nights to stay on the beach in the \"Lanai Bayside.\" It was worth the extra $50 per night, and it took only a few minutes to coordinate, though I felt slighted having to pay - the resort was practically empty and again it would have been a nice gesture. All in all we had a very memorable visit. The hotel is centrally located but secluded from the surrounding attractions.

Now having stayed there, I think I can be helpful to sort out the disparities. First, I think it helps to know about the reviewer. I'm comfortable in a clean Motel 6, but stay about once every six months in $300 and up resorts. Cleanliness and no deferred maintenance is paramount to me. Service is important, but I'm satisfied if the resort \"makes it right for mistakes, as long as there are only one or two that don't greatly affect the purpose for my stay. I hate overpaying, but don't mind paying a lot if I get something special for the price. So with that in mind... The first impression driving up to the resort is very impressive. You meander up a beautiful private drive, with well manicured and landscaped grounds. The check in building is OK. There was a snafu immediately at check-in. I couldn't determine if it was the fault of the resort or the agent, but all was straighten out ,with much apology, in about 1/2 hour, a bit long for a tired family. If you arrived on public transportation someone in an oversized golf cart will take you to your room. You'll need it. Even if you drive, ask for someone to guide you to your room, especially at night. You WILL get lost on your own. Because of the package I booked, our room was probably on the lower-end pricing end of what's available. Considering the on-line pictures, I was disappointed at the drive-up appeal of the bungalow: fronting on a parking lot, although concealed by some attractive landscaping. Once inside, I found the room small, but very appealing, recently updated, with warm materials, and thoughtful interior decorating. The bathroom was well-done. All was spotlessly clean. Ask for a room with a water view. Many rooms have none, despite what you'd think from their pictures. It looks like the water-view rooms would make most people very happy. We were in San Diego during record cold, so opted out of visiting the pools which looked attractive. There are two main restaurants. I highly recommend breakfast at the Barefoot Bar and Grill. It reminds me of some of the nicer open-air resort restaurants in Hawaii with surround-views of Mission Bay, sea-water pools containing large native fish, and ubigitous, gulls, terns, herons and egrets standing by ready for any scraps your children care to share. Food and service were excellent, but we chose a low-volume time to dine. I don't know if they get busy. The putt-putt course is a unique, natural grass course with some very long putting between holes. It looks entertaining. Great views of Mission Bay from the climb-up observatory. If you're taking kids to Sea World you can't get much closer than this resort. Service overall was fair, not great for the price. My impression is they're somewhat understaffed. For example we ordered room service that took over one hour, and they never responded to our call to pick up the tray. We called back to tell them we'd leave it outside and it remained there overnight - spread around and picked over by gulls. The overall quality is very good, but not Four Seasons good. If you haven't been to many high-end resorts I think you'll be delighted. If you're used to high end service you'll be a little or a lot disappointed. Bottom line. If you can get a deal, I think it's well-worth it.

Barefoot Grill was casual and we opted to sit outside and had fun trying out their selection of margaritas.

The resort is nice, but there was one major negative that caused me to have a terrible experience. When I got to my room late at night, I noticed a terrible smell. I thought that maybe the room was a smoking room and the smell was a deodorant to mask the smell of smoke. I travel almost every week on business, so have dealt with this before. I was too tired to switch rooms that evening, so went to sleep. I had a hard time sleeping and kept waking up with a burning sensation in my throat and a bad headache. I made it through the night and felt better after I got some fresh air the next morning. I also switched rooms. After a full day at the conference and feeling healthy again, I moved into my new room. Within 15 minutes, I had the same burning and headache. It was even worse than the prior night. I ended up checking out and staying at the Hilton at the airport. The management was reasonable and didn't charge me a penalty for cancelling. Also, they told me that they use a number of chemicals in the room. Clearly, I had some type of reaction to these chemicals. It has never happened to me before in nearly 20 years of business travel, so it is something unique to Paradise Point. Be careful, especially if you are bringing young children! Other than this, the place was reasonably nice. The rooms are large, though modestly appointed. The bathroom was adequate, with a nice shower head and good water pressure, but the decor was sparse and showing some signs of age. (I don't think the tubs and toilets have been upgraded recently.)

I lwould expect the kitchen to be partially stocked with such itmes as utencils, cork screw, hand towels, possibly popcorn for the microwave. You are welcome to bring food from home, just remember there is only a microwave, small refrigerator and sink.

Housekeeping arrived 10 minutes after our call for more towels and the roll away (comfortable). In room movies - can't pause and no close caption. Room service was quick and well prepared, though remember the 18% gratuity and $3.50 per delivery is added to the bill. Our Garden bungalow was quiet until Sunday morning at 8:00, my 12 year old daughter was woke by 4 screaming children. Bike rental, croquet, ping pong, minature golf ,swimming all available, as well as water sport rental. Bikes ran out quickly. Main Pool was very crowded every day, but it's the only large family pool in the resort. Watch out for extremely fast cart drivers (employees), making housekeeping and room service deliveries! My son was almost hit by one while riding his bike. They need to slow down! Yes, parking is $20.00 per day, but we had our own numbered spot, no searching for a parking spot after a full day at Sea World. We only ate at the Barefoot Grill (room service food comes from here). Very nice staff, good food, good drinks, just watch out for the birds on the patio during the day! The large ones are very aggressive and will steal your food. Overall, a nice resort.

They must be completely expecting something different then what Paradise Point really is. I can't even begin to think of one negative thing to say about it. If you are expecting a high rise building with elevators and penthouses, this isn't it. If you are expetcing the Ritz Carlton with contemporary decor and snooty bellhops, this isn't it. This hotel is it's own island located in the best location you could ask for in San Diego. Minutes from Pacific and Mission Beaches, on the same road as SeaWorld, minutes from downtown and the zoo. close to old town, seaport village, coronado island, anything you could possibly want to do in San Diego is no more then 15 minutes away. The hotel itself is goregous. It is HUGE and with exotic plantlife and flowers. There is so much to do here on the resort that you could stay for a week and never leave the hotel. from renting a jetski to lounging at one of the 5 pools, to getting an amazing massage at the wonderful spa, this place has it all. The rooms make you feel like youre right at home. The decor is friendly and inviting, the linens are the best Ive ever slept in- got the best sleep of my life in that bed. The decor doesn't need to be updated- that is how it is SUPPOSED to be. It is rustic, unique and comfortable. The bathroom is HUGE with 2 rooms- one for the double marble sink and the other for the toilet and shower area. The maid service was also fabulous. Our room was steps from the beach (which was sparkling clean despite what other travelers found) even though we only had a garden lanai. At night you could have a fire in one of the many firepits located on the beach. Everyone was friendly (including many of the people staying there) and accomodating- I truly cannot understand what people can find to complain about. I guess some people will complain no matter what. Paradise Point is truly paradise- don't listen to the people who need the toilet to be lined with gold to have a good time.

Now we know why!! No one would stay if they didn't HAVE to). Recent posts on the site have it right -- Paradise Point is like an old Hawaiian hotel from the 70's. My personal opinion is, don't stay in this area at all. It's a tourist trap with a less than nice beach area. We'll never return. We love downtown San Diego and love La Jolla even more. My advice is, stay away from Mission Bay and away from Paradise Point and you'll hopefully have a better experience than we did.

Unfortunately, it faced the parking lot. We called and asked if there were any other available rooms that didn't face the parking lot (it was my birthday, yada yada...) They immediately rebooked us into another room that faced one of their many duck ponds. I thought that their signature restaurant Baleen was very good, if expensive. Their pool was crowded, but we didn't even try to go to any of their 4 additional pools because we were lazy and simply sat in the sun drinking pina coladas. I popped into the spa for one of their facials and pedicures (great experience for both my 6 year old daughter and myself). Anyway, I really liked Paradise Point. Everyone was very friendly and my family and I had a wonderful time.

The kids loved to look in the rockpool and look at all the fish swimming in it. The pools are fantastic. My kids swam here pretty much all day, and there is sand on the side of the pool, excellend for sand playing. It was wonderful to sit back, relax, watch the kids swim and sip on a (expensive) cocktail. On the downside, during peak summer periods they need to regularly clean the toilets as they get very wet, sandy and slippery. Not a nice combination. On the weekends in summer they have movie night at the pool, which my daughter just loved. Overall we had a wonderful relaxing stay, with resort prices. Perfect for kids during summer. I recommend to save your money and get a garden room instead of a bay view. You will be pretty much in the pool, not in the bay.

I arrived at Paradise Point (they did not know that I was doing a sight visit) after a very long night of traveling with my 10 year old and my husband.

The grounds here are very nice but it is not a resort. It is a motel. Hot, Dirty, worn, and Old. I was told by Norman at Paradise Point that as soon as I woke I could come back and check into my room.....so after no sleep I called around 9:00 a.m. and was told that check in was 4:00. I explained everything to the front desk clerk and she said \"sorry..........come on by and we'll buy you lunch... but check in is 4:00. \" Long story short.............they did not charge me the $20 parking every day and they took off a charged dinner on my bill. Would I stay here again? Probably not. It is more important to me to be reassured a room when I am traveling with my family. On top of that, I should have been handled by a manager....but it seems that this happens all of the time at Paradise Point so nothing special is done. The rooms are old, just like many of the write ups say. They are very worn and could use as much attention as the grounds get. We did have a room on a little pond with ducks. This kept my 10 year old busy. The bed squeeked, the sofa bed was VERY thin, I cloroxed the bathroom........it wasn't clean enough for me. Everything in the room is worn from years of use. The carpet is very old and dirty. Bring flip flops or slippers .....my sons feet were BLACK from walking around the room barefoot. The grounds here are beautiful.

Our first week, we were at the Marriott Residence Inn in Hotel Circle which was a perfect base for all our amusement park hopping. Then up to Irvine's Hyatt Regency for a karate tournament. I will review these properties too, but suffice it to say that they met or exceeded our expectations. Unfortunately, Paradise Point did not. Our plans had been to spend the last few days of our trip lounging in the deck chairs in front of our beachfront bungalow next to a pristine (or at least well maintained beach) while our preteen boys played on the beach and in the water. When we arrived to check in, we were soooo excited. The grounds were lovely. The pools were pretty. The ponds were great and we loved the fact that there were sweet little ducks swimming around everywhere (we didn't know that we'd spend the next four days yelling at other people's kids not to throw rocks at the ducks, but I guess that's besides the point!). Our room wasn't quite ready for us, so we took the map the girl at the front desk gave us and went off to check out the general area where she told us our room would be. The first thing I noticed was that the \"beach\" in the picture wasn't exactly what I expected, it was more of a manmade cove - no waves - big drainage pipe spewing who knows what into the water with a warning sign not to swim within 72 hours after a rain - one stretch with no sand, just a huge wall of boulders. I became concerned about the specific location of our room (i.e. was it going to be near the sewage pipe or the boulders?) and went back to the desk to ask. The clerk didn't know, but when I told her that putting my two pre-teen boys near those boulders was a trip to the emergency room waiting to happen (I'm sure she heard \"lawsuit\" although I didn't say it) she said she'd put in a request in the back. When they called us to tell us our room was ready, we picked up the keys to Unit #526 (located comfortably between sewage pipe and boulders) and were pleasantly surprised to find that our room was quite lovely. The bathroom was set up so the kids needn't wake us in the middle of the night to potty (unlike the Marriott). The masterbedroom didn't have blackout curtains, but the thick shrubs shaded the windows nicely for late mornings. (On a side note, the thick shrubs only lasted two nights. For some reason they sent the lawn guy with a ladder and an electic trimmer to cut them down at 7:30 a.m. the second morning we were there. We spent the next three nights hanging every available towel in the room in the windows trying to block out the glaring parking lot lights!) No matter, the kids hit the beach and we hit the deck chairs and that's when I started noticing the trash...everywhere. Pizza boxes, beer cans (and bottles), wrappers, all sorts of nasty stuff, old, moldy towels, abandoned shoes, and so on. I called the front desk to ask them what time of day they came by to clean the beach and they said that it was a, \"public beach\" and they weren't responsible for cleaning it. Funny how the beach in front of the Hotel Del Coronado is public too, and yet the Del manages to clean it anyhow. So, not wanting to spend the next four days looking at a gross trashy beach, we cleaned our section ourselves. I even picked up a maxipad! #^$^%#%@^%!!!! GROSS!!!! I must have used a whole bar of soap washing my hands (which was never replaced - I'm glad I snagged some from the Hyatt!!)! Some other points...like others have mentioned, the food in the hotel restaurants is mediocre and overpriced and I laugh at whoever said the tuna in my salad was \"sashimi grade\". It should have been in a can. The beach is definitely a public beach. It is located next to a public park where some unsavory elements tend to hang out until half past late in the evening (we once had to listen to heavy bass from car speakers past 3 a.m. - another time they were shooting off bottle rockets!) The hotel staff once again can not help with this situation. The hotel doesn't keep the beach clean with the exception of when they are preparing for their beach karaoke night. They did manage to pick some of the trash (which was overflowing the cans) up in preparation for making us listen to drunken hotel staff and guests blaring karaoke in the style of the worlds worst American Idol auditions until 10:30 p.m. - so much for our nice peaceful bonfire. When I called to ask what it was about and when it would end, they didn't know. They thought it might be entertainment from one of the restaurants (that we weren't near) or possibly a wedding. It was painfully obvious it was a hotel sponsored function - they even had a last call for their cash bar! They just once again didn't want to claim responsibility for something obnoxious. I feel particularly sorry for the poor people whose lawn they claimed to set up the speakers on. To make a long story longer, instead of spending a lot of time hanging out around the \"beach\" in front of our $550 plus tax plus $20 for parking (even though every room has its own spot) like we planned, we ended up spending most of our time in other places.

They loved the pools, beach, observation tower, tame ducks and walking paths. They loved breakfast at the Barefoot Grill, where Harry the heron hangs out ready to dive at plates. They loved hitching rides around the property on golf carts. Room 364 was just across the sidewalk and within sight of the main pool's hot tub, so close that my husband and I could sneak out after the kids were asleep at night. Yet the room was surrounded by lush gardens and was very quiet. The room had two queen-size beds, a large armoire with a TV and mini-fridge, a table and two chairs and another bench in a small alcove. The dressing room was large, with two sinks and a large closet. Showers were hot with great water pressure. We had a small porch with chairs, and a small group of ducks waddled by each morning begging for handouts. The room, nicely decorated in bright yellow and navy, was larger than most four-person rooms we encountered in California. What really stood out was the service. Our first night's reservations were lost (which we discovered just before leaving home.) The management put us up at the Catamaran across the bay and covered our taxi transfer the next morning. That seemed sufficient to us, but they also paid for breakfast at the Barefoot Grill AND paid for our tickets to Sea World. I was very impressed with that show of concern. We encounted that attitude again when the main pool closed temporarily just as we arrived in the afternoon. We went back to our room and called for information about the other pools, since the weather was chilly and we were looking for a hot tub or heated pool. A few minutes later, Ben the bellman arrived with a golf cart and took us to the adults-only pool. I worried about being there with the kids, and he told us if anyone asked, we should just mention he brought us there. A few other families showed up, thanks to Ben, and we had a great afternoon. (No adults showed up without kids -- probably too cold.) We travel a lot with our kids, and found this resort friendlier than most.

The good points below make it a great family destination. Wish they would fix the Bad and the Ugly though . . . We agree with the prior post that guests should not expect a fancy spa type of resort. THE GOOD: The pool, the location (near Sea World, Mission Beach, airport and more), in-room refrigerator, bay front rooms, small putt putt course. We had a one BR suite on the beach on the bay. Our daughter loved playing in the sand right outside the room and swimming in the pool. Fast access to area attractions was a real plus. We enjoyed the pool side bar & grill, and the large suite. Also a good family friendly restaurant on the grounds, and a very nice gift shop. Room prices were good for the area. THE BAD: Like seemingly all hotels in the Mission Bay area, it seriously needs to be renovated and updated. The rooms have decent decor, with some newer furniture, but the overall feel is pretty worn. The exterior and landscaping is very worn and not well maintained. The maid service is slow and not so good. Bunch of guys driving around in carts doing nothing. They have an espresso bar, but its hours of operations are erratic, and the grinder had some disgusting looking beans around the top. The coffee was not very good. THE UGLY: Our room (and others) flooded during the rain, with brown water seeping up through the floor and pouring down through the light fixture in the bathroom. Judging by the water damage on the baseboards and walls, this was not a new problem. At least they didn't argue when we asked for a partial refund.

With so many small buildings, each requiring it's own water heater, roof system, and plumbing, it's really tough to manage. It's not built like one huge building with one system to control everything. I'm sure each building also has it's own electrical panel too. The hotel does a pretty good job keeping up considering the challenges. 2. The scale is enormous. It's almost like it's own amusement park with all the paths and vegetation and wildlife. Everyday staff is outside hosing down the bird droppings and trimming the vegetation. The birds are everywhere. They really make a mess. But the exterior is quite clean considering the birds. 3. I don't know how the hotel can charge as little as they can considering the huge staff required to keep the place up. The staff required are 10 times the amount required for a single building high rise type structure. 4. The age of the buildings put them right at the point of being torn down.

We splurged, since this was our honeymoon, and expected luxury; This is not a luxurious resort! The rooms are all single story bugalows;from the internet description we expected an \"islandy\" feel. We arrived to a rundown exterior; our room had cracked cement walls and rotting wood chairs. The inside of the room is nice with rustic decor and the bathrooms are the best part. However, halfway through the trip we found a leak in the ceiling which was dripping on the floor and bed. We called twice and were told someone would come out. They never did so we ended up moving the bed to avoid getting wet. The resort does have nice pools, but it was too cool to use them. I definatley would not stay here in the winter, since the pools are the one nice part you can use if it is warm enough. The resort has two restaurants, Baleen and the Barefoot. We had breakfast and lunch at Barefoot, and although the food was ok, we found the service to be very slow. We had booked Baleen for New Year's Eve but were called that day and told we could not be accomodated due to the weather, they had closed the outdoor patio. (Lucky for us the Gaslamp Distict is close by and we found a great restaurant)Another word about the restaurants...make sure you check your bill, we had charges to our room for the restaurant that others had signed off on and clearly did not match or signature or even name. We complained and they did remove them, but beware! I decided to treat myself to the Spa one day, but have to say it was not worth it. I have been to spas all over the world and this is very overpriced and has no added extra's. I had to wait for a shower which was not that clean, and the sauna was not hot. I paid $220 for a 80 minute treatment, and expected to get to use the facilities...but there really were none. They do have a small gym which you can use the day of service, but regular hotel patrons pay $10 a day for. For the price of this hotel the gym should be free! Also the \"quiet room\" I look forward to at spas is next the main pool were tons of kids were playing, so it is not Quiet! The lasrt night we ordered room service, which tasted ok, but took an hour to arrive. It was pricey but room service always is, but what killed me was an 18% gratuity charge PLUS a delivery charge....more added fees! So we finally check out, and are glad to be done, when we get slammed one final time! As I mentioned before there were errors on our bill, but they also charge $16 per day for parking! Usually I can understand this when the fee is told upfront, but from the way it was presented at check in you thought the parking was included. The spot has your room number on it, so if you don't use it no one else will....just another way to bang you out for a few bucks.

We paid an extra $50 a night to upgrade to a bayside view room- 233. To be honest, I was a little nervous about staying here because of the reviews on here, but we had a great time- don't be put off. We found staff to be helpful and friendly. The grounds are really amazing- gorgeous gardens and pools, with blazing torches at night- it was a shame that we had lousy weather as we would have enjoyed it much more with a bit of sun. Having said this, the pools are heated, and we loved the adult pool with the hot tub at night- it is pretty much deserted and very romantic with changing light colours in the pool/tub at night, with clean towels provided at the pool. If the weather had been hotter we'd have loved to have stayed on the loungers there. The bayside view was really lovely too. We ate at the Barefoot Bar and Grill every night and for breakfast one day- we found the prices to be reasonable and the food nice- eg $6.95 for 3 massive pancakes and syrup. Service was very good too. If you feel like eating out one night and don't have a car, take the no. 9 bus into Old Town, where there are lots of nice Mexican restaurants. The bus stop is at the end of the entrance to the hotel. the Baleen was too expensive for us. Sea World is a short walk away. We wanted to visit Coronado, so took the Old trolley Bus tour which can be booked and picked up from the hotel for $30, which was good value. We also went shopping at Horton Plaza and at Fashion valley. You can get on the no 9 and change at the Old Town transit center for Fashion Valley mall, all for $1.75 fare. Alternatively there is a free shuttle that goes from the hotel twice a day except Sunday. We loved the shopping and got some bargains in the Macys sale. On the downside, we were pleased with the room, but found the carpet to be a bit dirty if we went barefoot- probably because of the bayside location. It did smell a bit musty on arrival, but we didn't notice it after that and it didn't affect my asthma at all - think it's its sea location which causes this- we went to mauritius and had the same problem with mustiness but worse. We didn't have ants- and were generally pleased with the size and facilities in the room- not as bad as painted on here. Gift shop was very pricey for essentials, which was a shame ($7.99 for a sandwich). These aspects stop us giving it a 5- if the prices for rooms were a little lower and the rooms refurbished we would have given the resort 5. Similarly, we found the Spa to be very expensive ($120 for a 50 minute facial), so did not use this, when i would have loved to have gone if it had been a bit cheaper.

Our main objective was clean grounds with a tropical atmosphere and walking distance to the beach, all of which were met at Paradise Point. Considering the price difference between a Bay View room or a Lanai Garden View room, we found the latter more affordable for us. Upon check-in I requested a room with a view of the lagoon (thanks to the advice of another reviewer). Our room (123) was clean, very near the lobby and overlooked a lagoon with ducks, which the kids loved to visit on our walks of the grounds. The room did not have a window, so we had to leave the air conditioner on to keep cool. It would have been nice to really enjoy some of those wonderful evening breezes. The front door is all glass, so there is some natural light in the room. The lush landscaping is really beautiful. There are winding paths all throughout the complex, so keep the map provided by the front desk. We requested 2 queen beds and a crib for our youngest. We found the sleeping arrangement comfortable at night, but with 5 people moving around, it was cramped in the morning while getting ready. We didn't spend much time in the room, so it wasn't a huge issue for us. We spent 1 entire day at the main pool. The shallow end is painted to look like sand, but is really concrete. Regardless, it is very shallow for the small kids and gently slopes from ankle deep to approx 5 ft. deep. My family had an absolute blast at the pool. We met a very nice family and spent the day talking to them in the shallow waters while our children played and splashed. The main pool has a beach cafe and provides waitress service for beverages (alcohol & non-alcohol) and lunch items (burgers, hot dogs, chicken wraps, salads), which was convenient so we didn't have to interrupt our fun to shower & dress the children to have lunch.

The room looked as if it had been recently painted and gave the feel of a beach house. The resort just needs some TLC - the lagoons were rather dirty, full of bird feathers and debris and the main swimming pool, although well used, never really looked clean and did not entice you to go in for a dip. There were a lot of birds about and obviously where you have wild birds you also have bird poo and plenty of it - everywhere!! The birds were very off putting around the 'Barefoot Bar and Grill' as they used to land on the tables and finish any food scraps before the servers had time to clear the tables. It was unhygienic and unpleasant as they came swooping in and landed on the next table. The food at the 'Barefoot' was Ok but on the expensive side for what you got.

Tennis. bikes, croquet, putting, boats, jet skis etc were all available but were very cost prohibitive.

There was nothing fancy about the room we were assigned to: a small room with 2 double beds, a small table, a television hutch with drawers and a small dorm-sized refrigerator (which we found helpful to stock with drinks and lucheon meats), as the Resort's restaurants were over priced and the food was only \"adequate\". There was a sizable walk-in closet a nice sized vanity area, with the bath & toilet in a separate room. The cleanliness of the room was questionable...although we had no difficulities with any ants or other bugs. I didn't feel the accommodations were worthy of the heafty price we paid per night. Also note that this agency has the nerve to charge for parking on top of what you're already paying!!! ($18 per night). The pool areas are nice, but not very clean.

Room: We selected a garden view that had 2 queen beds. Room was small and had more of a street view than garden. Inside the room was a table with 1 chair, a lounge chair, a TV and small refrig. There was a closet with iron and board next to a vanity area. The bathroom was small in size. There was an area in the back (outside) that had 2 lounge chairs. Depending on the size of your family, you might feel squeezed in as we did. The whole complex is one level, so no one above you! Recommendations: If you want a \"garden view, ask for one away from the street that actually looks over a pond or garden. Parking: You park right next to your room. However, it costs $15 per day! Grounds: Lots of flowers, trees, birds, ducks, ponds, fish and trash. For such a big, beautiful area, it's a shame that the grounds are not kept up better. There were areas of trash in the ponds and even a dead duck. The duck was still there when we left! Some of the ponds smelled due to lack of moving water. Pools: There's 5 pools in this complex. The \"main\" pool area is a sandy, beach like area surrounded by lots of lounge chairs. There's also a food/drink area for kids and adults. The problem here is that the pool is only 3 1/2 ft deep. This is great for small kids to maybe 7. If you want to actually swim, this area won't work. There's also a jucuzzi. The other \"heated pools\" include: >An adults area only. Nice pool and jucuzzi, but not for kids >The \"waterfall\" pool was great for my kids. Heated and 8ft deep. Activities: 18 hole, min golf ($9 per person), bike rentals ($10-$20per hr). There's a marina that has sailboats, motor boats, pedal boats ($20-$80 per hr). The beach area has several \"fire\" pits. One suggestion would be to bring your own wood and have a beach party. The complex charges you $50 for a small stack of wood, some marshmellows and stuff to make smores. Food: Room Service (didn't use so I don't have a recommendation).The complex has 2 places to eat: 1 casual, 1 semi-upscale. We ate 2 times at Barefoot (casual). We sat outside next to a pond area that included sharks, sting-rays...Food was average. There's a kids menu. Adult plates averaged $12-15. They also serve breakfast. Didn't eat at the \"upscale\" place. Didn't eat at the \"main\" pool area. There's also a \"Market/Gift shop\". Prices are way overpriced. We actually paid less at PetCo park than the complex \"market\" Location: From a location point of view, you're within minutes of everything. 10 mins to Belmont Park, 15 mins to Balboa Park/Zoo, 5 mins to Sea World, 15 mins to Seaport Village, 15 mins to Old Towne. The complex offers no transportation to local attractions. There were several taxi's I saw however. Overall it was just average.

I had originally read some good reviews on this hotel--it was not until a few days before departure that I started reading some bad ones. If I had it to do over again I probably would have picked a different resort. Check in was fine- we arrived about 1:30 and our room was ready. Very nice man gave our girls and my husband a ride in his shuttle to our room and I followed in the van. I was immediately disappointed with the location of the room. It was right next to the convention center . This made our view from our room some type of wood fence that was used to hide some of their equiptment. Since I had not specified where I wanted my room, I did not complain. I was also disappointed about the size of the room. There were two queen sized beds and a small desk with two chairs. The TV was set into an armoure that also held a very small refridgerator. If my husband and I had been traveling alone the amount of space would have been fine. The bathroom sink was very nice, but again very small. The shower/bath was also tiny.There was a strong must smell in the room. I decided not to fret as we were planning on spending the majority of the time at the pool and Sea World. We ordered room service that night. Took about 30 min to get our food. I would give it a 2 on a scale of 1 to 5. Not cheep by the way! In the morning we woke up to find we had visitors in the bathroom. Ants! I was not pleased about this. I do not go camping because I like the outdoors to stay outdoors!! We called housekeeping and advised them we would be gone for the day and would appreciate the ants be gone when we came back. Sea World was wonderful. Only stayed a few hours. Did breakfast with Shamu--I highly reccomend this for the kids!! They loved it!! Decided to go back to the hotel and swim. We would finish Sea World the next day. We really enjoyed the main pool. There were many families, but that was fine with us...we had ours with us!! The service at the pool was great. We always had a drink in our hand and the food was OK. Not a very big selection and the prices were high, but it was nice to be able to eat at the pool. The girls had their hair braided poolside. They thought that was neat. I would give the pool area a 4 on my 1-5 scale. The ants did make a return a couple of times and eventually I did not smell the musty smell. Must have gotten used to it. When we checked out we complained again about the ants and the fact that one day we came back and had no parking space--there was something going on at the convention center. They ended up crediting two days of parking which was $18/day. There were many on site activites- boat rental, bike rental, ect. We did not visit the beach at the resort, we drove to Mission Beach. Don't get me wrong. We had a wonderful time on our vacation. The room issues did not ruin the week, however I would not reccomend this resort or stay here again.

Our room was clean and nice and the grounds are decently maintained overall. The service was attentive, especially at the pool, where we ate lunch one day. We also ate one meal at the Barefoot Bar and Grill and the service was friendly and the food decent. The only bad thing is there are tons of large birds everywhere at the Barefoot Bar and Grill and one was eating eggs off of a table near us, which I thought was really gross. The family sitting there must have found it acceptable because they just sat there and allowed it. The restaurant should post signs discouraging that because the birds are a bit of a nuisance. I felt safe walking around the resort, even at night, because of all the families and other people around. The main pool is very large and warm and the pool area is kept clean. Some areas of the grounds could use a little TLC, such as a bit of trash in the lagoons and the water is a little funky in some places. Some of the outdoor furniture by the lagoons could also use a cleaning as well (the pool furniture is kept very nice). We stay at a lot of hotels and I felt that Paradise Point did an overall good job of meeting our needs. I am picky and would be quick to point out anything gross or dirty in our room. The curtains in our room need to be replaced because they were torn and worn on top. Other than that, the beds are very clean and comfortable and the rooms are quiet. I guess people's impression of this resort depends a lot on where the room is located and there is a lot of variation. Our room did not smell musty at all, nor was the carpet dirty, as I have read in other reviews. Why some rooms are cleaner than others seems strange to me as well (different housekeeping staff?). This is a nice, family-orientated place to relax. There are lots of kids everywhere, so we felt very comfortable (I was not the only pregnant lady by the pool). I wanted a place to stay with the kids while my husband worked in San Diego and not have to drive anywhere during the day. Our room was right on the bay and we had a lovely view. We walked on the beach at night and enjoyed all the bonfires and other people around. One last thing-the prices for snacks are very high in the gift shop and restaurants are pricey (the resort does seems to nickle and dime you). Since the rooms have refridgerators, we went to a grocery store and stocked up on juice boxes, bottled water, yogarts, fruit, etc. and ate breakfast on our little patio. For dinner, we left the resort and ate at some of the wonderful places San Diego has to offer, such as in Old Town, and for a lot less than Paradise Point.

Nice to be able to park the car right near our casita room. We are from the desert so the cool and green was NICE. On the pond I amused myself with feeding the ducks, and the fish for the snowy egret that stayed at my side all wkend. Food was okay--fruits and veg. were fresh-- San Diego is fairly compact so location didn't matter that much.. Nice conference room on the water with windows. Hate those dark-hole rooms in hotels. Easy to get around off-property, near La Jolla and other beaches. One staff member that stood out to me, she was helpful and a jewel. NOT VERY GOOD: First thing in the room, had no screen on the sliding door--so I called maintainance and they had to come and put one on. We live with A/C all summer so I wanted FRESH AIR all weekend. I spoke Spanish to the gentlemen, and tipped him, after all--it's management that screwing up not him. Water main broke and we were out of water within the first two hrs. Then they shut if off 9pm-5am to repair it. Left us a note with bottled water...as it should be! Two locks on the door, only one worked, the deadbolt above did not. Seemed like I could never get printed info from the Concierge--he was not there, and they didn't leave out any brochures --as if they were stingy or something, I wanted some maps and info on what to do, go, see. None to be found put out in racks. We asked for extra hangers for our room, and we got these WIRE ONES that looked like what you get at the cleaners with the cardboard bar on the bottom. Gee I mean, I can live with those but hey, what we were paying for a ROOM?? COME ON... SPELLED OUT CHEAP to me the first hour! OVERALL IMPRESSIONS: Would not pay to go back. The price doesn't compare to what you get. I like comfy rooms and clean, not worn. I need to feel, safe, clean and okay with the energy of room. The worn also makes it not feel very clean. Details mean alot! The details were overlooked.... Beds okay, nothing special--could be more firm. Our room felt like it was a bit dated and worn. And we were there for a conference, so our group bought a big block of rooms. You'd think they'd want our business back. I think some of the reviews I have read come from people with kids and some can live with a certain messyness and chaoticness -- I come from a family of 10 kids so I am not a snob. Families with kids can dirty up the rooms, or don't care about dingy carpets, etc.....so they overlooked the room points. We didn't go to SeaWorld so that was irrelevant to us, the location. I worked for the airlines, travelled extensively and have been to many nice resorts and even motel 6's...we've lived in Europe and all over the U.S, and can enjoy nice Motel 6's to the very posh. Paradise Point survives because of people who buy into mediocrity, and pay that kind of money for inferior services and goods, so it promotes it. The property is old and needs heavy revamping, which is why the pipes keep breaking, etc. No money is being put into the hotel for upgrading--shame, it's a nice property, just poorly managed. You can just look at it to tell. The rooms and details of the property look deteriorated. One day it might shut down from run down. Also, when I check into a resort or hotel, their main business is to supply a comfortable place to sleep and be during our stay, and the first impression I get is when I walk into that room. I mean, I told my husband, hey--here I am having to be on the phone calling for MAINTAINANCE, etc. and these are the things I do at HOME! When I arrive on vacation, I shouldn't have to be taking care of ordinary room maintainance things because that is what I am paying a resort to provide! So that didn't set a very nice TONE for our 5 day stay. My niece lives in San Diego and she kept telling me that we were staying at a VERY NICE RESORT. We brought her back to our room and she walked in and said--\"oh..this doesn't look like what I'd expect, for what you paid.\" So BINGO! We had a nice time, but really, this has been one of the most expensive places we have stayed this past year --I am talking about the room price--nice resorts always will have expensive eateries....so that is a given....close enough to other places to eat within a short drive....the little restaurant on the water was okay but we didn't eat at the nite-dining one. I am surprised for such a large resort there were only 2 restaurants on the property. There was some nice staff that helped to make our stay pleasant, those are the few that go out of their way to please and put in 110%, but not all were like that. I am so surprised, our 1st trip to San Diego and for that area, seems like other resorts and hotels would be UP from this place.

Bring air freshener. -- The grounds are interesting and fun for the kids, with lagoons (which are not for water play, as they're nasty), many many birds (ducks, etc.), a cool fish/shark/ray pond. They have chairs on little docks in the lagoon areas, to make you want to sit and relax. But once you get near them, you see that they're essentially fowl furniture -- complete with poop all around. Ewe! The worst part -- the clincher -- was the \"white-sand beach\" we were expecting our room to open out to (per the brochure). It's dirt! Dirty DIRT. Not \"sand\" by any stretch of the imagination. The highlight was the pool area. That's the only place there's any actual sand for the kids to play in. The pool area makes it worth staying here again, just in a regular garden room -- not a pricey bay-view bungalow. My advice: pick the cheapest room, enjoy Sea World, the zoo and Balboa Park for most of your time, and allow for plenty of pool time.

Very accommodating and a relaxed atmosphere. Resort casual dress. Had room service twice. Since the place is so big, food was slightly cool by the time we received it. It was just okay. Only problem, is they don't come back and get the trays, leave it up to the cleaning people. Biggest drawback, no ceiling fans and no robes in rooms. Quite unusually not to have robes especially at a spa resort. Overall, I would probably go back here only for the spa experience. Pool was crowded with families and small children.

There was no screen on the door (even though there was a track for one), so you couldn't leave the door open without the ducks wandering into the room. There were cigarette butts all over the lawn outside the room. The butts remained, even after the landscapers spent the next morning grooming the grounds outside my room. The security lock on the main door to the room appeared to have been reattached before, like the door may have been kicked-in in the past. The ice machine and pop machine were located a good 5+ minute walk from the room and the grounds are very dark at night. The spa was terrible -- small, cheap and overpriced (they constantly are upselling you -- talking you into additional services and/or products. I had a facial and the therapist insisted that I needed a brow waxing and made me feel like I'd be an ugly fool not to let her do it. Then she wanted to sell me very expensive products for my face...). Back to the spa -- no waiting area, no whirlpools, very small saunas and steamrooms and only two showers in the locker room. And they only gave you one small bath towel. There were no piles of towels anywhere in the locker room -- just one small towel in your assigned locker. The \"business center\" was a joke. I wanted to FedEx some materials back to my office, so I went to the \"business center\" to find an unstaffed room with computers, printers, fax machines and credit card readers for your payment.

That's pretty standard in every hotel here. But, if you're looking for one of those warm weather resorts with a huge pool near the ocean - this is definitely NOT it. I live in Los Angeles and we drove down for a few days with our 6 year-old daughter. This place is a great location if you're headed to Sea World. (It's next door.) And it was loaded with folks from England who we enjoyed meeting. But, it had some kinks that bugged me. When we arrived (a bit before the 4 PM check-in) the computer was down and they couldn't check us in. We had to wait an hour to check-in. The main pool is not very big and the jacuzzi is small and up the steps from the pool. There are three other pools on the property - but the others are much smaller and only one other one is heated. (It was chilly when we were there.) There is only one jacuzzi. This might seem picky - but, this is a huge complex with dozens of rooms. If the weather had been warmer and more people were in the pool and jacuzzi - you wouldn't have been able to move. As it was - I kept bumping into people when I was swimming. Our room was a lanai room - no view of anything except the parking lot in front of our room. Okay, that's what we paid for, but forget about the barbecue pit and view of the water unless you want to pay $300 a night. (Not really worth it.) Our room was conveniently located next to the main lobby and pool though. And it gave us easy access to our car. There seemed to be a lot of hidden costs where you felt nickel and dimed: $18 for parking, $10 to use the gym. The food at the restaurant was not very good and overpriced and the service was poor. And if you want to order one of those tropical drinks while you sit by the pool - it's $9.00. Oh and leave the golf clubs at home - that silly putting course they have is for kids and they charge extra to use it! Our first morning we were woken up by the gardeners at 6:15 AM mowing the lawn right outside our room. We complained and got $50 off the room. But, I would have prefered the sleep. That afternoon we returned from Sea World to find my earrings were missing from the room. We complained again and got more money off - but, again I would have preferred the return of my opal earrings. The rooms are nicely decorated in \"country\" style. But, the maid short-sheeted our beds every night and by morning I was sleeping on a bare mattress. When you go to San Diego you have three choices of areas to stay in: the Gaslamp area downtown which is terrific - you can walk everywhere. But, maybe not the best place for families with young children. There's Old Town which is a must see, another walking area and some nice hotels are there, (Best Western Hacienda is wonderful) but you might get some freeway traffic noise. Then there is the Mission Bay area near Sea World. Paradise Point is really on a point that juts out into Mission Bay. You have to know though that this is a marina and boating area - and you are not allowed to swim at the beach across from the hotel. The other problem with Paradise Point is that you have to drive to get to anything. You can't walk to restaurants or stores or pick up the trolley to Mexico like in the Gaslamp or Old Town area. Still I think if you have kids you might like the space at Paradise Point where the kids can run around. San Diego is a compact city though (unlike LA!) and Old Town and downtown San Diego are only a few minutes drive away. If you stay at Paradise Point, I'd suggest getting your drinks and some snacks at the grocery store. Thankfully there's a small (empty) fridge in the room and if you just drive down the road from the hotel you'll find a Von's and Ralphs. There are some things to reccomend this hotel: the staff at the front desk was courteous, the hotel was clean and well maintained and there was an effort to accomodate the guests. There's some nice touches on the property like the fountains that turn into torches at night. I'm sure the spa is nice - although I didn't have a treatment. But, I have to tell you the $10 for the gym was worth it because it also alllows you to use the eucalyptus steam room in the spa - now that was HEAVEN!", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mammoth Lakes, CA", "Title": "\u201cHow can you not love this property?\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3365041", "Content": "I just got back 4/12/2005.

The only bad part was I felt like I was in a bubble.. the doors were glass and had a sheer fabric for privacy. Behind the sheer fabric was a plastic thicker cloth, so at night I felt fine, but I could see people peeking in while they walked the beach. The check in process was ok. I didn't know that check in was 4:00 and I had a massage at 4. I checked in at 3:00 only to be told my 2 rooms were not ready yet. My one friend decided not to get a spa treatment and said she'd wait til 4. Well by 5 we still had no room. The resort gave us a $30 credit but heavily hinted to use it at the bar. I guess they did not want to \"refund\" any money, eh? If you want a place to stroll or water sports, this is a great place. Plenty of hideaway area to sit and relax... lots of Ducks and fowl walking around... not at all intimiadated by the guests. I wish we had more time to sit around the outside area with a drink... or even lounged in the check in area. I do admit that the service was prompt. We had one of the doors missing a sheer fabric. I called housekeeping and they fixed it in 15 minutes. Their concierge was friendly but not very helpful in suggesting a reasonable priced steak restaurant. They had a stack of menus to choose from local restaurants but they were as pricey as you can get.. well the one she showed me was \"Max's\" and steaks were $30+. She offered making reservations, which was helpful, but We ended up going to a local Outback Steakhouse, off the 8 freeway. It was a bit frustrating that the concierge had no clue where the nearest Outback was when we asked for directions. The massage treatment was wonderful... price was no different than any other resort ($95 for a 50 min sweedish, $145 for an 80 min serenity massage) but I did find their automatic 20 percent tip a bit outrageous. I know I could have adjusted it if I didn't feel it was worth 20 percent, but they should allow the guest to determine, not have them tell you how much. I think the $18 parking was a bit outrageous. You do get to park right near your bungalow (or they call it the Lanai) but the area was so squishy, I felt the car next to me would ding my car. I think if you want to park near you can pay. If you don't mind walking you should have free parking near the Gift Shop. The breakfast at the Barefoot restaurant was tasty and good, but a bit pricey. $8 for oatmeal and raisins, $3.95 for a carafe of coffee (per person), $3.95 for OJ (but squeezed with pulp), and $11 for corned beef hash with an egg & holandaise sauce on top.", "Date": "April 11, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "staffs", "Title": "\u201ctropical paradise in san diego\u201d", "Author": "draycot2", "ReviewID": "UR3346038", "Content": "After reading other reviews we were a little worried about our visit , however we found the hotel name very apt, you really are in paradise.

I live in the area but threw together a quick surprise for my girlfriend. I was a little cautious after reading mixed reviews. Although, I've come to realize that these reviews can often be tainted because people didn't get the weather they wanted or had other bad experiences beyond the control of a hotel. I've stayed at several luxury resorts for work such as the Ritz-Carlton (Naples, Boston, Atlanta, San Juan), Westin Diplomat, The Jefferson (Richmond), Loews Coronado, and several other. Paradise Point is not at that level but I paid at least $200 less per night. I thought the grounds were gorgious and I found the staff extremely nice and friendly. I thought the rooms were comfortable and nice. I really enjoyed the privacy and layout of the resort. All the rooms are \"bungalow' style. They upgraded us to a bay view after I told them about the occasion and because there was availability. The room was a bit musty at first but the mositure we've had in area is probably the cause of that. After we opened the patio door and let the breeze come through the room, it was very nice. We ate lunch at the grill. I didn't find it as expensive as everyone else in these reviews. It's not fast-food prices and the food was good. All and all we both thought the property was nice and well worth the cost. It offers a lot more than a cookie-cutter downtown hotel. The best advise I could give is to take these reviews with a grain of salt. I would definitely recommend this resort if you're looking for affordable accomodations in a great location.

We just returned from a 1 night trip that I had won a $200 gift certificate for from work. The room was small, I asked for 1 king bed, got 2 queens instead, the bathrooms were DISCUSTING, the toilet had so much mold under the tank lid it was caked on about 1/2 an inch wide, which you could only see if you were sitting in the bath tub or bend down in the shower. The door to the closet was broken which made it unaccessable. The furnature was warped which made the drawers unable to open without a huge tug that I thought was going to bring down the 25\" TV. The wicker chair in the corner was FILLED with dust and the lamp shade was torn at ever edge. There were ants in the bathroom & on the counters, which given the wet \"tropical\" surroundings I guess it could be expected. The bed mattress was the only thing that was actually nice about the room. The window that looked out on to the \"lagoon\" collected so much moisture we couldnt even see out of it. and that \"lagoon\" turned out to be a small shallow duck pond that looked more like water collected in a rain storm. The heater was so bad, 1 it didnt work that well, 2, it was so loud we couldnt sleep when it was halfway working. there is a small frig on the shelf next to the tv that kicked on every 15-20 minutes with a high-pitched whining noise. We decided to rent a movie off the tv but just after choosing to buy the $11.99 flick my fiance accidently hit the channel button instead of the volumn and we were not able to get back to the movie selection. We had to call the front desk and verify we werent charged for a movie we didnt even get to watch, they said we were not charged but that the movie was no longer available because only so many rooms can rent a particular movie at once. It didnt help matters that I sat on hold trying to talk to the front desk for over 5 minutes.

We experenced everything bad that every reviewer seemed to experence and though it all - we still had a good time! We stayed for a week during Thanksgiving 2004. It started off at check in - we were told that the water was not working and they were not sure when it would be turned on. We were told not to use the bathroom or use any water at all. If you had to wash your hands please use bottled water and you will not be charge. My wife was less than pleased, luckily, our flight was not that long so no one had to take shower. I remembered that we were on on island and these things do happen. After my wife had the maintence people provide a bucket of water so we could use the toilet - we had to discuss if we were going to really stay here for a week. At 11:00pm - 7 hours after check in - the water came back on. The room itself was Ok, nothing really special and it really didn't match the polynesian island theme. Three people taking showers, you will run out of hot water. We had a garden - lagoon view and by the weeks end, we had bugs inside (we were being careful about that too) the room. Somethings just seemed strange to us but that could be just where we are from - Oregon & Japan. At the begining of the week, there must have been about ten people in the whole hotel - the staff out numbered us two to one. It was off season and it was fun to have the run of the place even though I felt a little uneasy about eating in a restuarant and we're the only people there. Though out this, they would charge for everything; parking and miniture golf ($16 & $9 per person) fitness center...everything! If they could find a way to squeeze a dime out of you, they will try (duck and fish food were @1.25 each)! Maid service was Ok, once during the week they miss us and we had to call. Room service was quick and they had no problem in sending us extra plates and silverware. By Thanksgiving, the place started to fill up. Total, must of been about half full but it felt very pack. I cannot imagine this place completly full -parking, swiming even the rooms with their very thin walls would be horrible. The problems with check out were there - a mystery charge of $8.00 for water appeared. But we checked our bill using the in room system through the televison and called to clear it up before leaving. The funny thing about this whole ordeal was that I contacted the hotel via e-mail before we arrived and express my concerns about staying here. I pointed out many of things that I have read in the other reviews in this section and was reassured that none of this would come to pass. Even with all this, the grounds were just great. We brought our own scooters and was really alot of fun going through the maze of trails and roads. We tried swiming once at he main pool but the water wasn't really heated so we didn't stay to long. The location of the hotel is fantastic, nothing except for maybe the Wild Animale Park, is thirty minutes away. And once you get the \"lay of the land\" getting around is really easy. Over Thanksgiving weekend, they lit the Christmas lights and they were absolutely beautiful. So even with all the little things, it still was pleasant experence. I read on the door or somewhere that the maxium price for the room is $350 per night. I feel that the room was really worth about $125.00 plus $16 for parking and $5.00 for tax.

Yes, the prices at the restaurant seemed a little high for family style eating and the spa was pricey as well, and some of the features in the room were slightly worn, but there were so many positive things about the hotel that outweighed any negative marks I've seen written about to date. First of all, the setting is just beautiful. The grounds are extremely unique with the lush landscaping, ponds, wildlife, and so forth. Moreover, the main pool/jacuzzi area is equally beautiful and great fun to swim in for kids and adults alike. While the bedroom we stayed in was a little dusty perhaps at first and had a torn screen door, it is hard to find such spacious rooms with such comfortable beds and linens anywhere. Moreover, any issues we asked housekeeping to attend to were promptly addressed. I also really liked how the rooms all had patios that went out to lovely gardens and ponds. It made for some very relaxing morning coffee sessions with my husband! Finally, I found the staff most helpful. At times, the facility seemed a little understaffed, but we also visited at an off-peak time, so this wasn't a big problem. Once Thanksgiving week rolled around, I saw many more staff on site, so I'm sure it is a function of numbers of people checked into the hotel.

I believe that tennis, mini-golf, and use of the basketball court could have been included in the room rate. It is at the Del and at the Marriott properties. We felt cheated and decided to spend our time off-property! Meals were outrageous.

We booked this vacation from a flyer that we received from our kids' school and got a great price (under $200 per night). This is definitely a FAMILY resort with beautiful, sprawling grounds. It's also a 5 minute drive to Sea World. Because of the great price, I was not asking for too much and therefore very pleasantly surprised. If I had gone there thinking that I was staying at a luxury resort, I probably would have been a bit disappointed as it is an older property. However, I knew what I was getting into and therefore very happy with our stay. We checked in around 3:15 p.m. Our room was ready but our friend's room was not. THey said it would be ready at 4:00 p.m. and sure enough they called at 4 and it was ready. Our rooms were very clean (no problems with carpet) and the beds were really comfortable. We had absolutely no problem with noise. I noticed that another reviewer had bowl of fruit, etc on check in. They must have been staying in the presidential suites as we did not have this but never would have expected it for the price. We had a fine location facing the lagoon and quite close to the kids pool, volley ball court and main pool. The main pool was very busy with children so my 6 and 4 year old fit right in. Drink prices were expensive ($8-9 and $3ish for kids drink) but not out of line. For service we had to go up to bar. We ate at Baleen's one night which has fantastic views on the Bay. Very good service and everyone liked their meals. Although it was not on children's menu, they fixed a grilled cheese sandwich for my daughter. If we went back again, I'd probably skip this place as I don't like to spend $25-$30+ per entree when I am eating with kids. The next night (and morning) we ate at Barefoot Bar and Grill. Highly recommend as they had great food reasonably priced (entrees $10-24). The kids danced on the stage and searched for sea life. Very kid friendly. We had no problems with billing at checkout. Throughout our stay, my friend and I would ask for our bills to be evenly split and charged to each room. They got it right every time with no problems! ONLY NEGATIVE ... We had to call for room service 2x when we got back from Sea World on Sunday at 4:30ish.

We were referred here by our travel agent because it had a kids program that my kids (7 & 9) could stay at while I was in meetings. While the property was very pretty, it was not worth the $300 a night! The rooms were ok but nothing to write home about. The refridgerator knob was broken and it froze our drinks. A light bulb was missing over the bathroom vanity (which is very small) and I killed two spiders in the bathroom. The beds however were comfortable. My co-worker had no chairs on their patio. When they called about it they expected they would bring out nice chairs like the other patios had - they brought $5 plastic chairs. They were disappointed for the money they spent and value they recieved. Plus a $16 a night parking fee is rediculous. I was surprised that they charge for every amenity - tennis, fitness, etc. even the USA Today delivered to your room which most upscale hotels do not. The kids club was not geared for business travelers as the hours were 9:30 to 4:00 at a whopping price of $160 for 6 1/2 hours. There is no actual room for the kids like there is in other resorts they basically take the kids around the resort doing activites like playing tennis, walking on the beach, riding a bike, etc. My kids did have fun but the price and the times were not comparable to the other hotels with kids programs. The food was very overpriced and not very good. We ate at the pool and at the Barefoot restaurant - we would have gone out but there is not much around the resort close. I got a half hour massage at the spa and and found out that it is only for 25 minutes and they automatically charge a 20% gratuity! The treatments are all overpriced too - $72 for a 25 minute massage. On the 28th we moved to the Catamaran Hotel for the rest of our trip. The Catamaran has - which had similar type of grounds like Paradise but was $100 a day cheaper. We booked it through Southwest Airlines Vacation Package. We were pleasantly suprised that kids under 12 eat free at the Atoll restaurant, tickets for complimentary appetizers at the restaurant, complimentary cruise on Mission Bay for the family on the Bahia Bell, and tickets for 2 free hours in the arcade per child. Our room was spacious and had a kitchen with a full size refridgerator, dishes and cookware. Which was great to save money on eating out every meal. Plus the hotel had a schedule of activites most of which were free including surfing lessons, movie on the beach with coke & popcorn, kyak lessons, etc. They also didn't charge like the Paradise Point for all of the amenities like the fitness center, tennis, etc. They did charge for parking but it was $9.00 a night and it was covered in a garage.

We slept well as the beds were firm, yet soft, included lightweight down comforters, and the rooms very quiet.If your idea of a vacation is spending time on an island with populated with single story bungalows nestled among a spectacular garden, pools, water features, the bay and birds, this is the resort hotel for you.If you plan to spend several days sightseeing in the San Diego region - this resort's central location is ideal. Sea World is next door, and it is only a short drive to the Zoo, La Jolla, Balboa Park, Point Loma, the Gaslamp District, Old Town, and Coronado Island.Check for the \"package deal\" rooms. Your deal may not be the same, but for an extra $20.00/day we received free parking ($16 value) and a $35 credit towards breakfast at the Barefoot Bar & Grill. If it is a sunny morning, the view from the Grill patio is priceless. The breakfasts here are similar in quality and price to Mimi's, and the kids meals are a good deal. If you skip the $3.50 orange juice or coffee drinks - breakfast for a family of 4 (2 pre-teens) can average around $35.00 - and the view of the bay is wonderful.If you are new to the area and need some restaurant suggestions, I'd suggest checking out the San Diego Union Tribune website at http://------------------------------------------------------Other reviewers may have been \"bumped\" from receiving their rooms as other guests don't leave when originally planned - but this IS a resort hotel you don't want to leave.", "Date": "May 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGood but not great\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1848888", "Content": "Our bayside room had outstanding views!

Upon checking in, we learned that out room was not ready. I asked the person at the front desk what time check-out occurred and she said Noon. Why it took 45 minutes (we were finally allowed access at 4 PM) for our room to be ready I have no clue.I was led to believe by the person with whom I d spoken that the room was a suite, and that it was, indeed, separate from other structures. This was not the case. Our room, in fact, was attached to three other bungalows. I was also led to believe that this and another room (no ocean view) at $279 were the only two kinds of rooms left available at the resort. When we checked in, I heard a front desk attendant mentioning there were rooms available for far less. Thinking we were locked in to our $299 per night room, plus the fact that the phone reservation person said it was usually a $579 per night room, I figured What the heck? and we waited the 45 minutes until the room was ready. Upon seeing the room, we were surprised by: its small size; the fact that it was referred to as a suite at all; the fact that it was NOT separate but rather an attached structure -- the nearest room to ours housing a screaming child; the two spiders in the kitchen; the rust on the shower fixtures; the incredibly noisy heater; the fact that we bumped into doors all night, fumbling for the bathroom in the dark; and, in the morning, the fact that there were no flats on the windows, allowing the light to flow in at daybreak.The view, yes, was quite lovely from our windows, but other than that, the suite struck us as nothing more than a glorified Holiday Inn room. I, in fact, have been in Holiday Inns where I felt a great deal more comfortable.

Even if you do it is about $14 per day to park!!The so called \"Island Market\" (a deli with t-shirts) takes full advantage of the monopoly it has over people without a car - $7.50 for a sandwich - which was horrible and $10 for 6 pancakes.The rooms are ok if you get a rear facing patio like we had, otherwise you overlook the road.The main pool isn't anything great, and the smaller pools are not heated and can be VERY cold.However, reception staff do need a lesson in politeness, not once was one pleasant.I must say that the consiege \"Bobby\" was brilliant, very nice gentleman, very helpful and courteous, and also the barefoot vare & grill was good food and good service.Look closely before you book", "Date": "October 14, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cWatch Out!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1364177", "Content": "We were supposed to stay in a \"Lanai Garden\" room.

My assistant had searched for places for the family and the original one we wanted was booked so we thought we would try this. Without a doubt the site and brochure stuff is way different than the hotel. Here is the summary: For kids, it was above average, the movies in the pool every night were cool, and the fun stuff for them to do. The biggest issue we had was a bunch of your Army boys in for the weekend it seemed drinking alcohol and smoking at the kids pool. No security and it was out of control. The hotel needs to think about the fact they have kids around and deal with security issues fast. The beach is nice and quiet for the most part. Restaurants leave a lot to be desired as a \"family\" type place. I sent my wife to the spa for 6 hours and she said it was probably one of the best ones she had been to..and she knows the best of the best ( bad for me). The room, well we went all out and had to bunbalows joining for our selves. Which with two kids 2 yrs and 1 yr this was great as we got to sleep. Ants, YES we had em...we read about this and we had them all over, they sprayed 3 times and we still had them..I guess when you are right on the water as our room was what can you do!! The room for the most part was very nice, big bathroom good beds, they need to improve the kitchen in the room, the room service ( we used a service 4 times like waiters on wheels it was AWESEOME!!! and way cheaper then room service!!!) overall we would think about going back but not for a long time, maybe after we tried a few more family style places..", "Date": "September 21, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cA huge disappointment\u201d", "Author": "schubeedo", "ReviewID": "UR1283709", "Content": "Well, I guess it all depends on what your idea of paradise is. We saw a lot of repeat customers when we stayed here in August 2002, so clearly it works for some - but not for me. Don't be duped, as I was, by the slick web site that suggests a serene high-end experience. Service, value and amenities here are really poor. The beach is ugly, the main pool is mediocre, and all the little pools aren't even worth a mention. I want to especially caution anyone thinking of coming here with small children, as I did not find this place at all suitable for them. Of most concern are the roads that COVER the property (the lovely landscaping is only in the center, not around the units), with constant traffic and many, many blind corners. One step off our patio and my kids were at risk. Also, with kids, and limited restaurant options on site, seemed worth it to pay extra for a room (large and clean, by the way) with a kitchen - but only got a microwave and bar fridge. No cookware or cooking utensils and had to phone to even get some plates. I asked for a refund on the \"kitchen\" and got it.

We could have spent thousands more for a trip to Hawaii and it would not have been any better than Paradise Island. With that $12.50 burger came a place so beautiful - lushious greenery, a pond next to the Bay so clear you could see the fish swim, a splashing waterfall, a trio of Spanish musicians, and friendly, well-polished service. We climbed the 81 step observatory and watched the 9:50-10:00 PM spectacular fireworks at Sea World (walking distance). I travel for my job and have high standards when it comes to hotels.
