The hotel staff was uniformly friendly and helpful and all spoke English well. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel, because half a block away is a great bakery that supplied wonderful goodies for breakfast daily. My room was typically small for Europe; the bathroom was as well. The bed had an uncomfortable matress that sloped towards the edge--not enough that I fell out, but enough to make me wonder. I traveled as a single but booked a double room. It would have been quite cramped for two people. I noticed on the room plan posted on the door that there was one room smaller than mine on the second floor, but the others were larger. My room faced onto a kind of large air shaft, which meant the room was quiet.

Everything is within walking distance and you can catch the bato-boats if you\u2019d rather not walk. The Roissy bus stop at the Opera is about a 10 minute walk away (10 euro\u2019s/person) and there were four buses at the Opera at 8:30 am when we were leaving for the airport so we didn\u2019t have a wait (they run every 15 or so minutes). This was a Friday to Tuesday trip for us so it was important that it was easy to get to the hotel and walk everywhere we wanted to go and get back to CDG. The hotel elevator is small like everyone has described it, 2 people or 1 person and a bag or two (180 KG limit). We didn\u2019t find it to be a problem even though we wanted to be on the top floor (6th). We didn\u2019t turn on the heat in the room, but it got warm so we opened the doors to cool it down and there wasn\u2019t a lot of street noise. The walls are thin and we did have a neighbor that watched TV until the wee hours of the morning (flat screen TV\u2019s are mounted on the wall). The only thing I would do differently if we returned would be to not prepay for the breakfast. It was okay, but I don\u2019t think it was worth 14 euro\u2019s/person. We found a great patisserie a block up (left on Rue St. Honore) so that would have been an option for breakfast goodies too since we found the sandwiches were good there.

The Louvre Montana seemed like such a great value, I was scared that we would be disappointed. When we arrived, I could not believe what an excellent location we had! The hotel is directly off of Rue de Rivoli, steps from the Louvre and Tuileries Gardens. Easy access to the Metro and the train which will take you to Versailles and other places outside the city. We were also very close to Musee d'Orsay, my favorite part of the trip - better than the Louvre. There are lots of crowds in the Louvre and it seems so big and overwhelming. Musee d\"Orsay is smaller, an old train station and houses many works from the Impressionist period. We were able to get up close to works from van Gogh, Degas and Monet, something you can't do with the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. We spent an entire day at Versailles which was worth it, easy trip, but we froze in the line as it's not yet warm in Paris in March. Please visit Angelina's, a few blocks down Rue de Rivoli from the hotel, has the world's best hot chocolate and incredible desserts. We bought some to take home to our families. Better souvenirs than anything else we could find in Paris. Overall excellent trip, the hotel is clean, safe and has breakfast every day - that saved us money and time. I was petrified of the lift, too small for my claustrophobic taste, so my boyfriend rode up every evening while I worked off my Nutella filled crepes with a quick climb up the steps. We could see Sacre Coeur from our hotel window, very cool.

I think it was a great value for the location and conveniences, however, the rooms are VERY small European size and the bathroom and shower was even smaller...not to mention the bed was very hard and uncomfortable compared to the rooms we had in Italy. Also, the staff spoke perfect English and were the nicest people we encountered while in Paris!

After seeing the 2 star hotel she and her friends were staying in, our daughter decided that staying with mom and dad wasn't so bad after all. One note, wash cloths, bring your own. Didn't realize it but they are considered a personal item and the hotels do not stock them. You can buy them at Galleries Layfayette just up the street. One word of caution -- Bistro Louvre Carrousell on the corner up the street -- stay away -- when it came time to pay the bill the said my credit card was declined -- they tried 3 times to process the charge -- so I paid cash. Later that evening I had an email from the credit card company questioning why I had 3 charges for the same amount from the same restaurant. I went back to the restaurant with the email but suddenly no one spoke English any more. There are better places to eat anyway that are less touristy. Also, there is a great little bakery up the street (go up Rue St Roch and turn left at the end of the block) -- much cheaper and better than the shops along the Rue di Rivoli.

We had a top floor room which could have made it quiter, but the room was small but cleen and the bath new. The lift was fun it holds 180 Kg. Only two people could fit, but it works fine. Beatrice was very helpful at the front desk arranging things. Don't eat breakfast in the hotel, there are food stores around the corner. Breakfast is 12 euro in the hotel and is boiled eggs and some ham and bread.", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Emeraude Louvre Montana Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d207578-Reviews-Emeraude_Louvre_Montana_Hotel-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$228 - $417*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">12 rue Saint Roch</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">01 Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75001</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "207578", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b2/1d/b21d367a1e1cda53a122579c4ac937954large.jpg"}}
