There is no staff only one man who does evrything, janitor, recepcionist,... Neighbourhood is not to nice, ther is too many local bars and discos wich did not look very friendly. Hotel is in the courtyard of some fameus club, and you have to show your keys to a bouncer on gate, so you could get in your appartment. Above our window ( we were in the basement) are railwaygauge, and metro runaways there , so you have a fealing it is in your room till 00.30h and from 4.30h again, but we did not mind that at all. Position is good, metro station is 5 min walking , so you are only 3 metro stations from Colloseum ( 3minutes ) , 5 metro stations from Spanish stairs, 7 stations from Vatican. Just arround the corner ther is a big market with very good prices. Onother thing I did not like, is that there is no cleaning. Appartment is very well equipped, you have kitchen elements, washer machine, ironing board, iron, dishes, TV-but no cable, frige,...... Basicly, we like it.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cNothing good to say\u201d", "Author": "MsJonesEngland", "ReviewID": "UR16088317", "Content": "Absolutely horrendous stay at Rentroof. It was a couple of years ago since me and my boyfriend stayed there, but it still gets my blood boiling. Not only the location right next to train tracks was hugely disturbing, but the customer service (or the lack of it!) demonstrated by the staff was appalling! We booked our stay way in advance through their own website. They had good prices and we were very pleased with our choice. Well, just before we left England to go on our holiday, I checked the prices again and they had gone way up! And conveniently of course they hadnt confirmed the price in the confirmation email. I of course brought this up straight away once we arrived, but there was no budging. On top of this we were treated like criminals as they wanted us to pay the stay in advance!! whereas in the confirmation email it said payment required after the stay. I would strongly NOT recommend this place to anyone!", "Date": "May 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bruges", "Title": "\u201cNightmare in Rome!!!\u201d", "Author": "KenBruges", "ReviewID": "UR7194736", "Content": "My girlfriend and I arrived on a Friday night about 10:00pm, and feeling a little tired.

The icing on the cake: the place was infested with drunks from the large nightclub yelling up and down the courtyard until after 4:00am. No staff to complain about that noise. Not serious.

It was a pleasant stay. We were surprised by the modern furnishing. The apartment was new, clean and spacious. Beds were of good quality, kitchen was fully equipped, and towels were big and nice.
