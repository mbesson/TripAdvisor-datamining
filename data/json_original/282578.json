{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice stay I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in March 2008 and had a nice comfortable stay as a tourist. Hotel was easy to get to with the fine public transportation. I took the S-Bahn from the Airport to the Hauptbahnoff and then Tram 17 getting off at Leo Da Vince Allee stop and walking one block to the hotel. Total transfer from Airport to hotel is 45 minutes on S-Bahn/Tram. I had a 6am flight to LHR and the tram service started at 4.22am which easily got me to the airport by 5am. Check-in time states 2pm but I was allowed to checkin at 11am. I booked using hotels.com and they had a special of 3rd night free so total cost was $141USD for 3 nights. I didn't eat breakfast as the cost was 16 euros. The hotel is fairly new as the google satellite maps doesn't show the hotel or tram station existing. Hotel location was a bit out of the city center but with the Tram nearby (15min ride to Hauptbahnoff) it didn't really matter", "Date": "Mar 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR895286526", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SJ72"}, {"Content": "Good Value for Money This hotel was pretty much what you'd expect from a 4 start hotel. my only gripe was that the hotel staff were not as friendly as you'd expect. although most were helpful.

From airport - take train to Frankfurt am Hbf then take tram 17 in Redstock direction to Leonardo Da Vinci Allee stop. Turn right when you get off the tram and as you get to the main road turn left. The hotel is on the right at the next set of lights. Cost by public transport was about 6 Euros and it takes about half an hour. Cost by taxi was 22 Euros and it takes about 10-15 minutes.The hotel is pretty far from the city centre but there are plenty of trams to get you around.The rooms were clean but the pillows were pretty soft and lumpy (it seems that all european hotels have really soft pillows!). The shower head in our room was pretty dirty.There was indifferent service both at check in and in the breakfast room but the breakfast buffet had a good seleciton of hot and cold food.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR166133973", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "MuranoTA"}, {"Content": "Good hotel with very helpful staff This hotel seemed to be in the middle of nowhere but with the help of the staff, we realised that the tram to the city was a 2 minute walk. It made getting to and from the city very easy.

I stay at Tryp during business trips at least once a month. The hotel is nothing spectacular...but then the average nightly rate is 80EUR with breakfast! The rooms are all modern, very clean and well-designed. When booking I would recommend to upgrade to Comfort class as the rooms are bigger and you get complimentary toileteries. The breakfast is a feast!! The staff are always very helpful - and I know them all (I stayed here for over 6 weeks now since the beginning of 2005) It's 3 stops away from the Messe and 15 minutes taxi drive from the Airport.

From the outside I was a little skeptical, but once inside the lobby my opinion changed 360. The rooms are exactly like the picture, very clean and nice marble counter in the bathroom, comfortable bed, it was modern and definitely more catering towards the business person. (Read: the room was not large). I would definitely put this hotel in a higher category than a 3 star. The previous reviewer was correct about the doors, you have to swipe a card over them and then jiggle it - the reception actually gives you a demonstration on it. (What ever happened to keys?!) The main woman at the front desk is very helpful. Breakfast was dee-lish and very fresh - just make sure that you get down there in time to enjoy it. Location - Close to the airport. We took a tram (about 2 minute walk from the hotel) to the Altstadt and it took about 15-20 minutes including the wait for the tram. Neigborhood - A bit industrial - there is not much to do in the immediate area. Booking: I booked on the sol melia web site - there were no problems. We had a single with 2 twin beds. Perk - 10 free phone callsWierd things: the keys and the room temperature control. Both were a little uber modern for us - and I like technology?! Recommendation: Its a modern hotel with classic but small rooms, pretty clean, close to the city center.

It is very easy to get to from the main train station, using a new tram service that passes directly past it. The hotel is also near the Messe, which is what makes a lot of buisness people stay here. I would say the hotel is suitable for families, but not sure about the area at night. The door to the hotel rooms are very difficult to work out (you have to use a card) The staff are nice and so is the breakfast buffet! I would say the hotel suits the needs of buisnessmen a little better than families and tourists.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR451558413", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "afhkhafs"}, {"Content": "\u93c2\u822c\u4ed0\u9287\u5fcb\u4ef8\u9288\ue15c\u5138\u9288\u3083\u4efe\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u20ac\u4f75\u4ef9\u9288\u5098\u5139\u9288\u4fbf\u5157\u9288\u67ab\u5133\u9289\u70bd\u4eb4\u9288\u3083\u512a\u9288\u3083\u510a   showReview(22885043, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR211755582", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "hiroiwata"}, {"Content": "\u934f\u7a3f\u7037\u9428\u52e9\u4efe\u9289\u64b1\u5062\u9289\u5d83\u5063\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289?#x201d;
