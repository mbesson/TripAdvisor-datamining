A friend recommend this hotel to me so I made a reservation without really doing much research on other hotels. I do think, as others have noted, that it was a little expensive compared to other places we have stayed (we had just come from Florence and had a terrific, really spacious hotel room--actually more of an apartment). Our junior suite was definitely on the small side for a suite. But the room was very clean, the staff friendly and helpful for the most part (read a bit further to see what I mean) , and as I said, the hotel is in a very good location. And when you go to Rome, London, Paris, etc. everything is expensive so you just sort of get used to it! I actually liked the rooftop terrace. We went both evenings for a drink and I thought it was lovely (unlike a previous reviewer). My only complaint is that we were flying out of Rome at 6:00 p.m. on the day we checked out of the hotel. They kept our bags for us and when we returned, we asked if they could make change for a \u20ac20 bill (asked for two tens or four 5's--I don't remember) so we could tip the bellman (the hotel's own employee!) and maybe the cab driver. We were told that they would not do that for us because we had already checked out! That just seemed ridiculous to me. I really don't think we were asking for anything special or unusual. We had just paid \u20ac398 each night to stay there and they couldn't just trade us some smaller bills! So, even though the hotel was very nice, I can only give it an average rating because of that!

We live in Italy part of the year and are familiar with Rome and its hotels. This was our first visit to the Piranesi and we will return. The hotel itself has a smart, elegant feel without ovetones of any aloofness or pretension. The rooms have a clean, sharp look that are inviting and combine warm wood tones with crisp linens. The terraces, french doors, and high ceilings add the perfect compliment to the directoire style furniture. This is not of course forgeting the modern, marble bathrooms and air conditioning that will be appreciated by any of us who insist upon visiting Rome in the summer. The roof top bar is fab! Looking out over the Piazza del Popolo and the Borghese gardens drives home the realization that the Piranesi is in the premier area of Rome for fun, elegance, and, oh, by the way, two Caravaggios accross the square. Yes, you could stay at the de Russie (literally, accross the street)and pay three times as much, but why? Enjoy Rome, and spend your time and money on other memories than a hotel bill.

Additionally, we were NOT told that one cannot drive right up to the front door \u2026 traffic is restricted and only those who are licensed (i.e. taxis) are permitted on the road. After driving in circles around the Giardini Borghesi entirely too many times, we finally phoned the hotel to learn that they would send the doorman to meet up on the other side of the Piazza del Popolo and he would guide us back to the hotel. Once my son, daughter and I departed with him, my husband had to return the car to Europcar in a subterranean parking lot and make his way to the hotel. He was exhausted and dripping wet by the time he arrived \u2026 he ended up taking a rather long and roundabout route that had been recommended by Europcar. He desperately needed a shower and a drink!!! We booked a jr. suite which turned out to be a largish room with a double bed and 2 roll away cots. The mattresses were hard, the sheets not high quality, no extra pillows. The bathtub/shower was so poorly designed that it leaked every time one took a shower. We had to ask for extra towels. \uf0a7 No Internet because the owners are still thinking about it (this is not 1990! and a hotel in Rome that represents itself as a 4 star hotel should have internet access!) I had to walk to an Internet caf\u00e9 on the other side of the Piazza del Popolo to check e-mail. Breakfast was the standard cold meats, cereal, fruit salad, etc. The staff cleaning up in, what appeared to be, a kitchen adjacent to the dining room was very noisy.

The questionable part of the Hotel is that it is very Italian -- room sizes and prices vary greatly. If you speak some Italian or can work the system, you can get an excellent value. The small rooms are small but OK for a single traveler.
