We thought this hotel was striking because the shape of this hotel and the beautiful fountain at the front of the Piazza de Republic. The concierge was absolutely beautiful a wow factor when we arrived we were greeted by a lovely gentleman called Salvatoire at the concierge desk who later helped us with many queries every day apart from the last day. We had a fabulous bedroom the Classic room huge Queen size bed , lovely opulent decor marble bedside tables full minibar and lovely marble bathroom. Flowers were ordered as a surpriseby my husband arrived at the same time as we entered the room. We had a good size room and fund everything to be immaculate. We had a great location as the Metro and bus terminal was in easy reach. The main road takes you to the fantastic White Palace the \"Wedding Cake\" at the Palazzo Venezia.Colosseum is on the left rearside of this palace. We were extremely disappointed the next day that we had to have breakfast on the terrace restaurant as in the brochure it was indicated we were in a beautiful restaurant in the 1st floor. We were not informed about this. However we did enjoy the lovely breakfast selection until the Saturday morning when there were new waiting staff serving.We had cold cooked food and confusion with our menus wrong food was cooked and we waited almost 45 minutes before food arrived it was quite cool on the terrace in the morning and tablecloths were stained. Milk was the main probelm with our teas waiting staff appeared to not understand we need milk with English tea. The evening after sightseeing we would come back to the bedrooms to have a shower/bath and found the hot water tap ran warm water even after filling the bath we still found the water was cold which was not good either. This was a bit disappointing especially when we have spent money for 5 star service for luxury we didn't feel the breakfast deserved 5 satr status maybe 3 star! We made a formal complaint to the manager called Clare who was very nice and the problem was rectified and a letter of apology was sent to our room that day. We did have a fabulous service from the concierge gentleman called Salvatoire who was courteous, kind and very, very helpful towards helping us with a vase for my flowers and organising times for us with transport to airport and directions. He deserves a gold star.I had a sealed letter with wax sent to our door to confirm times and he organised everything we asked of him. On our last day in Rome we had a fantastic meal in the Tazio restaurant 4 courses of various choices and it was a gourmet delight very generous portions the chef deserved Michelin star. Thoroughly recommend everyone tries the food here fine dining excellent ambiance and we were the last to leave had a lovely chat to Mario the head waiter/manager there which sealed our approval and rounded off my birthday perfectly. We managed to see everything we wanted in Rome and we enjoyed our stay at the Exedra very much the staff were lovely and very helpful and kind and took to our complaints very seriously which is all we can ask if you stay 5 star.

The location was fantastic - easy walking distance to many tourist attractions and public transport directly outside. From the exterior of the hotel it looked very luxurious - as did the and lobby area. The breakfast was very good and most staff (especially the concierge) were very helpful. However, our room was very dark and didn't let in much light. When we asked to change rooms, another room was found that was slightly lighter but also much smaller. I would have expected that as we were staying there for 8 nights and they knew we were celebrating a special birthday, that they would have attempted to give us a nicer room. We spoke to other people staying for the conference for a shorter period of time that received a better quality of room. Overall I would say the rooms were quite average and not worth the price - they needed upgrading. Our TV hotel information wasn't working, and although we reported this twice, it wasn't repaired. Our shower also leaked quite badly and the airconditioning seemed to be on hot all the time, even when we turned it off - which made the room very stuffy and difficult to sleep in. The main issue with the hotel was the free wireless internet access. It was incredibly slow and constantly dropped out. It was very frustrating. We eventually found that access was best on the 5th floor away from the street side.

We stayed 3 nights and had 2 interconnecting rooms. Our rooms were fab: spacious (our double was L shaped and included a small dedicated office area), our son had a twin room which was equally large, the beds were really comfortable, decor was good, and the rooms were very clean. The bathrooms were on the small side but totally fine. We did have a bit of walk to get to our room but the standard of the rooms made up for it. The consierge Salvatore was fantasticly helpful and really made our stay special - he helped out with dining suggestions, was able to get us football ticket for the same night (not an easy task) and was a generally all round lovely guy. Breakfast was included in our package - through BA and just as well - you wouldn't want to pay \u20ac35 per person. Breakfast was a bit hit and miss - our first morning we'd invited 2 people to join us only to be told 'the kitchen is not working today!' We helped ourselves to the cold buffet of meats, bread, fruit etc but beware that as soon as something has gone it isn't replaced. The hostess is a little frosty and hasn't got a great grasp of English. The waiting staff are more pleasant but not brilliantly attentive. We did manage to get cooked breakfasts on the days following but they weren't great, everything was very oily and looked nothing like the photos in the menu - with pancakes/muffins missing from a breakfast showing bacon eggs and muffins!

Needless to say that I had quite some expectations, and was looking forward to staying at this 5 star posh hotel in the heart of Rome. But there were so many absurdities about this hotel that my experience with it appears to be quite confusing. The room was absolutely clean. The sheets and towels and gowns were changed every day. I was never disturbed in the room (unlike in other hotels, when personnel tries to fill the minibar or clean the room). Sleep quality was also not bad. The air conditioner was a bit noisy, but it did not interrupt the sleep. The things that I found to be absolutely absurd about the room are: In the bathroom of my room there was a standard set of toiletries including facial soap, shampoo, bath foam and bath salt, etc. The question is: why would anyone need bath foam and a bath salt in a SHOWER? The shower was leaking by the way, and every time after a shower I had a pool of water in the bathroom. There was also a crack in the shower tub. There was not waste basket in the bathroom, only one in the room. Needless to say that it is a bit awkward and inconvenient to use the room waste basket for all the trash. The hairdryer: the room was supposed to have an installed hairdryer (on the bathroom wall there was a part of an old hairdryer, the one that is normally stuck to the wall). However there was a regular travel size hairdryer instead. The problem with it was that it did not fit the size of the socket. And it was quite a challenge to plug it in every day (for some reason the cleaning lady was pulling out every day as well). I had to repeat this exercise a few time and it was quite annoying. When I needed to call the reception it took me a few attempts. I would normally expect that in a 5 star hotel someone would always pick up the phone if you need help. The food was also good. But for my liking there were way too many sweets. I guess their food would have benefitted if they provided more meets and less pastry. During breakfast they would offer you a variety of breakfasts (English, American, continental, etc.). But then the some of the staff do not speak English good enough to understand what you are ordering. The Breakfast also has a buffet. I would say that the variety of food in the buffet is good for a 3 or maximum 4 star hotel. But not impressive for a 5 star. Anyway the food was good and you would not leave hungry. One thing that struck me (in a positive way) is that when we were trying to call taxi from the hotel to the airport, concierge first offered us an option with the hotel car (some luxurious sedans) and voiced the price to us strait away (EUR 55). (A side note: in Rome a standard taxi rate from the hotel to the airport and vice versa is EUR 40). As in my experience hotels would most often just give you their own car and then overcharge you for the ride, I was pleasantly surprised that I was warned about the price and was offered an option of hotel car and official taxi. I guess any traveler would appreciate it if he/she is not being taken advantage of. As to their conference (convention) center: The hotel has a number of conference rooms and halls located in the basement. It seems impressive how the hotel has preserved the basement and the fundament of the building. In some places you would find glass floors showing you specially lit results of diggings and ground works. The air-conditioner there however is a real pain. It makes a terrible peeping and squeaking sound.

Our rooms had a balcony and were very spacious. Housekeeping did an excellent job keeping the room very tidy. The hotel roof had a swimming pool, albeit it was essentially a lap pool. It also had a bar and restaurant up there. But it is very expensive- $10 sodas. Although one of the concierge staff seemed like he had a stick up his butt, once you chatted with him, he was very helpful. They were helpful to give you directions or to make reservations for you. They had a fitness center that was minimal, but sufficient enough to get the job done. If you are willing to walk, we walked to the Colliseum and Spanish Steps. One day we walked back from the Vatican. It is a long walk, but if you like to roam around, it is very doable. If not, the subway or bus can take you to all the major places. Minuses It is pricey. If you stay here, you will pay good money for this place. If you did not get the breakfast included with your room, you will pay a lot for breakfast. However, the buffet was very good for a European country. The traditional American breakfast was not that good - the kids ordered them. But when in Europe, eat like a European.

There is a metro stop is located just outside the hotel. The hotel lobby was impressive and the front desk and other hotel staff we found were very customer orientated especially a woman named Olga the Customer Relations Specialist. The night we checked-in I told Olga and the staff at the front desk it was my birthday and within an hour after we checked-in the hotel brought me a birthday cake to our room. That was a first for me and a very \u201cNice un-expected touch\u201d to great customer service. The room we had was an upgraded room. They gave us an upgrade at a very good price.

It have everything we look for in a nice well equipped 5 star hotel room except an alarm clock, iron and ironing board for light pressing and coffee maker or hot water kettle. Also there was a turn down service at night but no chocolate was left on the pillows. We missed that touch. The TV channels were limited and bad just like all other hotels in Europe. It had only 4 to 5 English speaking channels including CNN International, Sky and BBC that gets old real fast. The internet was being changed over to wireless so we had to go to the 1st floor or lobby to get access to the internet. Business Center/VIP Lounge located on the 1st floor has computers and printers for printing out boarding passes. No charge if you don\u2019t print more than 10 or so pages.

All fruits cold meats and breads were offered in the typical buffet style. The restaurant staff was polite and very customer orientated. The only negative experience we encounter was our last night in the hotel. There was a party or something going on the 5th floor of the hotel. The music was very loud and annoying. The bass vibrated throughout our room rattling the pictures on the wall making it impossible to sleep. It started around 9:30 PM and lasted to 12:00 AM. We called the front desk twice. Once @ 11:00 PM and were told it would quit within 5 minutes. It didn\u2019t. We called again around 11:20 and were told they were going upstairs to investigate why the music was still playing. It quit close to 12:00 AM. We didn\u2019t expect this type of noise problem in a 5 star hotel.

It did not. I then went down to reception where the FOH manager apologised and said we could move rooms.

On the weekened we were there the breakfast was served in a semi open area on the top floor of the hotel which made it nice but unfortunately the buffet food attracted quite a few wasps which took a particular liking to some of the meats on it. This part was obviously not a good point. The pool which is located on the top floor is nice but relatively small, I guess on a hot summer day it can be refreshing. Overall facilities in the common areas of the hotel were fine and staff were generally nice. Room wise we liked the size of the junior suite we stayed in, we found it generous and one of the largest we stayed in. The bed was comfortable and we liked the pillows, for some reason a lot of hotels rooms we stay in come with very soft pillows which sometimes feel like you are sleeping on a thin fabric and not on a pillow.

Initially the staff were very helpful. Got to the room with a view over looking the piazza & fountain. The room was clean & the bed was fresh & very comfortable but the wall coverings & carpets were very worn. The bathroom was clean but the bath, fittings & tiling were 'tired'. I asked for another room but on viewing this one, we decided to stay put. The second room had no window & was very hot with the air con not really effective. Everything at the hotel was very very expensive. I know Rome is an expensive place but we had very little trouble finding many many reasonably priced cafes & restaurants. Breakfast was \u00a332.00 pppd. I looked in at breakfast & must admit I was none too impressed with the food on offer. There's no tea/coffee making facilities & no iron/ironing boards available, as Italian law 'apparently' states this as being too dangerous for visitors to use. It cost \u00a317.50 to get 1 of my wife's dresses ironed! Tea & coffee from room service is around \u00a37.00 pp. We took a travel kettle but forgot the adapter & the hotel would not supply one to us. A small beer costs around \u00a311.00 in all the hotel bars & a basic salad in the cafe bar outside is around \u00a330.00. It's really difficult to rate the hotel, as the building is beautiful, the rooms although a little tired are very large & the bed we had was fabulous. I should say it's a 5* building, with 4* rooms & 2-3* staff. However, this took nothing away from the holiday overall. We had a fabulous time in the city, an open air museum with, on the whole, the people not being able to do enough for you & around every corner another fabulous surprise awaits you. Within a few minutes walk of the hotel there are many street vendors selling ice cold drinks, fresh fruit etc & along the Via Internatzionle there's a Spar shop selling most things. (NOT plug adapters though!) Do book as many tours as you want to go in advance if you can. Queing in that heat is pretty traumatic! We went for 4 days & can't wait to return sometime in the future.

We stayed here for 2 nights and had an unbelievable time! Background: I chose this hotel after reading both good and bad reviews. As someone who doesnt believe many people that post 1 review and its a negative to their credit, I pushed on and booked the Boscolo and got an excellent rate through TA and Agoda. Location: The hotel is located in Piazza della Repubblica which is a safe and well populated part of town. Literally a 3 min walk from Termini Station and 5-7 mins in a cab to the Vatican, Trevi, Patheon and all the major sites. The open top Hop on/Hop off bus stop is a one min walk from the hotel and a great way to see the sights of Rome. We mainly used cabs to get around town (as the heat was stifiling at times!) and cost usually around 6 euro per time. Service: We arrived at 8am after a 24 hour trip. They were more than helpful and pleasant at reception, however couldnt give us our room on arrival due to a totally full hotel, however it was ready at 11am which was terrific. Concierge was one of the best I have ever had, with Salvatore proving an absolute highlight and pleasure. He lent us a mobile phone charger, walked us to ATM's, provided good choices of food and shopping and even organised sim card a short 2 min walk away. I would return for his service alone. Room: We had booked a Deluxe and also ended up with a balcony and view over the Piazza which was simply fantastic. So lovely to leave the balcony doors open for fresh air later on at night. We had two twin beds joined together and the beds were comfortable, however the pillows were quite flat and feather which i dont like. Room was very big, one of the largest in Rome and also had 2 comfy chairs and small coffee table, flat screen TV (which we didnt watch and all but one channel in Italian), a desk, area for luggage, mini bar, cupboard and spacious bathroom with separate bath and rain shower, toilet and bidet, 2 sinks and great lighting. Yes there is no tea/coffee facilities, but with so many things close by including their own cafe and McDonalds, it didnt bother me. Room Service: Had room service on one occasion of Pizza and a coffee...hot and delicious though the 10 euro room service charge was ridiculous. Hotel cafe/Bar: At there quite often and the service was the wait staff especially Evan was terrific. Lots of choice on the menus...lovely surprise was ordering coffee and getting complimentary cakes to go with it. Prices were good for euro standards and the atmosphere of comfortable chairs/tables and the view of the Piazza was great. DaySpa: Had organised a massage on the day of arrival for 10am. Arrived at 9:50am and told I was too early and to come back right on 10! Massage therapist was great, a really good way to ease the tension of the flight and for 60 euro for 1/2 hour, i thought it was excellent value. Pasquale even brought me espresso while I was waiting which was a nice touch. MiniBar: Had the usual choices and the prices were expensive as most minibars in good hotels, however the fridge was cold and there were no stuff ups on departure due to costs or anything. Lobby: was relaxing and really lovely feel to it. Very quiet and some magazines etc Porters were attentive and appreciated any sort of tip, though Concierge refused any tips saying it was their pleasure to help. Business Centre: 3 Acer computers in the Business Centre as well as magazines, refreshments. It was open to any guests and a nice big space. Pool Area: one of only 30 hotels in the Rome area with a pool, quite small but does the job and great views over the city. 8 or 9 lounge chairs, 2 lifeguards and also an area to sit and have drinks and the bar. It was on the rooftop and was never crowded which was great. Lifts: 4 lifts and always opened straight away. They are tiny however. Internet: No free Wifi, which many hotels in the world do charge for, however we had data on our sim cards which did the job. The internet access in the business centre was free so we could upload photos and print boarding passes etc. Problems: Our minibar wasnt working, however someone was sent up within 5 mins, as were requests for more towels etc. Service was always quick and never a problem. All in all, this is a high quality hotel (ask for a Balcony room) with excellent staff and a terrific Rome location. 5 star quality does vary throughout the world, however the building, amenities, ambience and room size are up with the best of them.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "England (Washington)", "Title": "\u201cAverage Hotel\u201d", "Author": "roadrunnner7691", "ReviewID": "UR115110886", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for a work event .

We were told that check in was at two in the afternoon, but that they would give us another room or we could wait for our original room, it would be our choice. Waiting for the original room was not an option due to our state of grogginess, so we opted for another room. At this point we were told that our new room would not have a king sized bed , it would have two twins that they were going to push together for us. We were also not going to have a view of the fountain, but one of the side street looking towards the termini. We felt that this new room was a downgrade. We were paying top price for five star accommodations & we felt that we were being put out. They said we can have another room but it was an upgrade and would cost more money!! After lots of talking & a visit from a manager, we were given an upgrade to a front facing room at our original rate. But it still wouldn't be ready for a few hours. I suggested that they give us any room of any size so that we can clean up and rest. That turned into another ordeal. As I stated before, we felt very put off & awkward during our check-in. To be honest I've felt more welcomed at a Days Inn!! As for the hotel itself, it was truly beautiful. Our upgraded room was huge & the view was to die for. The location was great too, we were steps from the metro and Via Nazionale a nice boulevard to shop.Another good thing about the hotel was the cleaning staff, they kept our room impeccable throughout our stay. The porters out front were also very attentive. The physical location & accommodations were five star all the way. Wish I could say the same about the staff at the front desk.

We were shown to our room, all excited about the delights we may see, wrong! We we given a room we an extremely rubbish view of some dirty roof tops, Poor day light in the room due to the small window, on the plus side the bed was large and comfortable. Bathroom was what I would describe as bijou for a 5*. One night we had room service - waited 30 minutes! yes 30 minutes! for someone to answer the phone! and they charge you a set 12% surcharge for all room service! The food itself was not that great, and was expensive in my opinion and I have stayed a a fair few hotels. The day of check out I dared to phone reception to double check the time I was to check out, again this took 20 minutes for someone to answer the phone. When they do answer the phone they are short and unfriendly which I didn't appreciate. I used the VIP Business lounge twice, one of the 3 computers wasn't working and only one has a printer so you may have to wait some time if you want to print off your boarding pass. One of the things that made me pick this hotel was the fact that its one of the very few in Rome with a swimming pool, so you can imagine how disappointed I was to find out that 2 of the 4 days we would be there it would be out of bounds along with the upstairs bar. This was due to a corporate function and a wedding. When i did get a chance to test out the pool I managed to put one foot in before jumping right back out again. Although it was 90 degrees during our stay this did not heat the unheated pool at all. It was freeeeeezing! So I didn't dare go near it again! The hotel on some plus sides: Location, you couldn't ask for more central! everything is a short bus/taxi ride away and its walking distance from the main train stain which takes you direct to the airport for 23 euros for 2 people verses a 60 euro taxi ride. The hotel was also clean. I can't comment on any of their restaurants as we choose to eat out as it was considerably cheaper. Overall, I think there are much better hotels in Rome for far less money!

The quality of room service at the Boscolo Exedra is dire and I would recomend anyone staying there to not pay over inflated prices for what is such poor quality food when there are so many fabulous places to eat in Rome. I arrived late and ordered a Beef entree with a Pannacotta dessert. Both were very poor quality - the Beef chewy and somewhat tasteless and the Panncotta still frozen. Rooms in the hotel do not have wireless internet, you are required to connect the 'original' way via a network cable - but the speed is still tiringly slow.

It is situated in the Piazza Republicca which if you are lucky enough to arrive at night will take your breath away. The stunning fountain and arced hotel makes for a truly dazzling welcome. The hotel is a 5 Star in terms of accommodations. The elaborate ceiling, LV trunks and classic Italian fabrics adorn a sweeping lobby - a great place to grab a drink if you don't mind spending 8 euro on a 8 oz diet coke. Let me repeat that... If you sit in the lobby or al fresco and order a coke, they will charge you 8 euro. You've already paid 300 euro for the room, so when in Rome... The hotel is huge, so specify if you want a room near the elevator and or a room with a view . Emailing the hotel ahead of time is a great idea and the front desk does appear to try their best to fulfill these requests. LOCATION: Stay here... it is beautiful and you feel like moving to Rome after spending a couple days in your perfectly located new home. 6 minute walk from Termini. The A Metro line is right outside your door. 10 minutes to the Spanish Steps or Colosseo by foot. Transit Tip#1 - while most taxis tack on an extra 10 euro for being \"called\" to a hotel, the Boscolo sits in a piazza with a taxi stand. That's an extra 10 euro in your pocket (or another diet coke for your wife !) Transit Tip#2 - 6 minutes to termini means that you can save about 60 euro and half an hour by taking a quick train (Leonardo Express) from FCO to Termini and then a quick 6 min walk to the hotel. STAFF: The concierge was extremely helpful and happily conversed in English. But remember, you aren't in NYC... so if you need a dinner recommendation you need to ask (as I always say... this is not the Ritz Carlton) ROOM: The bed was really comfortable, and the rooms were spacious for Europe. There was a couch, desk and ample space to waltz even in the \"regular\" rooms. The room was clean and the bathroom had double sinks, a shower and a bathtub. The shower leaked and I genuinely questioned if I was the first person to ever shower in it. I really just laughed it off as I mitigated the effects by just placing a few extra towels on the floor. No biggie ... the key to travel is to adapt! And moreover... I wasn't planning on spending more than 2 seconds thinking about that! The water pressure was awesome - and the bathroom was well lit (perfect makeup lighting). FOOD: The breakfast room was plentiful albeit the service was a bit disinterested. I suggest skipping it. No big breakfasts in rome. It is too hot and you have too much to see! Did Caesar stop for a snack?! No need to eat or dine in this hotel. The best food is found elsewhere during lunch... Bertizelli is a primo pizza place about 5 minutes away. Amongst dozens others. Have a drink one evening at the outside bar -its a beautiful scene - but you're in Rome so go out for your meals! Ok, don't laugh, but there is a McDs right next door that serves brioche in the mornings and has, what i estimate to be, a $30k cappuccino machine. Check em out - and save yourself the expensive breakfast in the hotel. The coffee is really out of this world. TIPS: Get the doorman to snap a great picture of you in front of the hotel when you return from dinner or drinking one late evening. Your friends will be impressed - the place really is a stunner.

She called back 30 mins later to say a bed was on its way and that another would be supplied for our son but that the person making the booking made a mistake. In the hour that it took to get our beds our terrible club sandwich came up an hour after we ordered it. To make matters worse, housekeeping put a sheet on with a hole in it and left it on. Tired, hungry and less then impressed we thought we'd make the best of it and not let it ruin our day. We went up to the pool. The pool was dirty and there is no service after 430PM so we couldn't even order a coffee. That night we were woken up by sensor lights that went on in our bedroom every time we moved in our beds. They failed to mention that these were on the stairs in our room or how to turn them off. The next morning we went to the breakfast room. The eggs were disgusting. I think they were powdered. Still we didn't complain. The final straw came when 2 days in a row the pool was shut. First day as there was a wedding and the second as it was closed for maintenance because it was filthy. Management failed to tell the guests at the hotel and that's when my husband finally lost it. He went to speak to management but he wasn't the only one. Seems a lot of the guests were just as upset as us. My husband explained to the manager he expected more from a five star hotel and that the only reason we stayed was that it had a pool that ironically we couldn't use. We checked out one day early.

The room didn't have wireless internet which was quite surprising, as most 3-4 hotels offer the service, let alone 5 stars. Reception didn't answer the phone when you called, it rang at least 7-10 times before someone picked up and even then, they were curt in their responses. Good luck if you needed a shirt ironed (because apparently, in Italy you cannot use iron's inside the rooms) as the front desk said it might take two hours for the laundry service to pick up my shirt, IF they could.. Don't bother with room service, prices were terrible. It's easier to get something from the local supermarket e.g. water, chips, etc. Although I didn't stay in the room long enough , as i was out exploring the sights everyday, to experience other services I was not really impressed with the hotel's staff in my short dealings with them. Wouldn't recommend this hotel if you're one of those tourists that spends an equal amount of time in the room as you do exploring the sights.

The coffee shop is not cheap at all, average drink is Euro 15... Dont forget to visit the church accross the street from the hotel, its surely worth the visit.. The rooms where HUGE, we had 2 connecting rooms, 305-307 the only semi connecting rooms in the hotel, each room was like 6x6 meters with high ceiling and a beautiful view. i guess our rooms were the largest in the hotel.

I decided to book a 5 stars hotel because it was a very special occasion for me. I saw here all the comments but my experience was very different and that is why I am giving a comment . When we arrived with the taxi I was amazed about the massive building with its fontain. The valet guys opened the door of the taxi and I felt like a movie star. We wanted to take the luggage inside but the gentleman told us to leave there and that they would take it directly to the room, they gave me a ticket. Check-in. Once we got in I saw this marvellous lobby with high ceiling and everything very luxury. We went to the reception desk in order to check-in and I felt like disturbing all the receptionists there. Then I approach to a young lady (thought she was busy with the computer) and told her that we wanted to check in. She was really rude, she took us in the middle of the lobby and told us that we had to wait till the receptionist came. We were CONFUSED After 30 minutes waiting, another lady came and asked us to sit in one of the horrible tables in the middle of the lobby. I've never seen such an unpolite receptionist, she was rude and mad, very dirty and nervous. While doing the check-in I thought she wanted to break down the computer which made us feel so bad and uncomfortable. She took us to the room which was very far! we had to take the elevator and then some other stairs to get there. The ceiling was in wood, very dark and horrifying. We got into this room with no natural light and a balcony facing a wall. I immediately told the lady that for 430 euro I was expecting a little bit more and she told me that standard rooms had no view. I was really dissapointed and told to myself never to come back. Luggage.- After 20 minutes waiting for the luggage we called guest services and there was a busy tone. My boyfriend and I had to go all the way down to ask for our luggage. The girl told us that it was coming and in fact the luggage came but it wasn't ours. After 2 hours of struggle we managed to have our luggage. Telephone-They told us the problem of the telefone would be resolved and in 3 nights it never did. Rooms- very dark, hairdryer didn't work at all and even if the told us they'd bring one they never did. Mirror and walls dirty. The room wasn't cleaned well during our stay: same towels and same hairs in the shower. If you want to take a shower in the morning or afternoon you will have to do it with fresh water because there is not hot water. Breakfast- it was ok but the hostess and people there don't have a clue about luxury, respect and service. Restaurant- Food was ok, expensive for what it was but ok. People at the bar and restaurant were very unpolite and I think even bored. I felt so frustrated that I wanted to go away and ask my money back. We met another couple in the hotel, we realized that they had a deluxe room, big one with nice view paying 100 euro less than what we payed.

In room internet service, while good, was 20 euros a day...not per room, but per computer! Yes, 2 people with a laptop each have to pay a total of 40 Euros a day to get online. Room service charges a 10 Euro service fee to their already bloated prices. They wanted to charge me 6 Euros for a coffee (OK, 5 star hotel prices) but also the 10 Euro fee for room service. 16 Euros for a cup of coffee?? Come on! The staff can be very hit and miss. Some of the front desk staff are very nice and helpful, however the oafish valet goons with their plucked eyebrows and fake tans leave a lot to be desired. They wander the lobby, overbearingly looking to help with something in order to get a tip. They also give you filthy looks if you aren't wearing a 3 piece suit with fancy sunglasses. The staff in the breakfast bar are pushy and rude. They don't seat you but then again they also wont let you choose where to sit in a nearly empty dining room. We sat down, started having coffee and were asked to move to a smaller table, despite the place being 95% empty. Calling Guest Services can be a chore. Most of the time they don't answer, and even when they do it takes a good 10-15 rings to get someone. The security is incredibly lax. Street vendors are allowed to set up shop outside the hotel where they harass you to buy umbrellas or dolls. There was even a shady looking guy soliciting \"anti-drug donations\" about 5 meters from the front door and he was there from morning to night. Hotel staff just ignored him. Each day we were there we had to deal with this when exiting the hotel. The street valets are useless if you need a cab. You can basically walk to Natzionale and get your own in 1/4 of the time. The wireless internet in the VIP lounge didn't work for our entire stay. Also, the room is frequently left unstaffed with the lights off, so you may have to search for someone to come up to the first floor to turn everything on. That's about it really. If this was a 3 star hotel charging 100 Euros a night, I guess it wouldn't be so bad. But at 300 Euros a night with a five star reputation it was a really substandard experience to say the least. I give it (barely) 3 stars as far as purported 5 star hotels go, mostly due to their location and cleanliness level. Not recommended. Pros - Not many. Splendid lobby, interesting hotel exterior, good location. Cons - In general this is hotel is not up to a 5 star standard.

Needless to say they did not have to apologise for any inconvenience caused, we had just been upgraded from a 4 star to a 5 star. I can only describe the Boscolo Exedra as plush luxury.

I have to say that it was an amazing experience. I was a bit apprehensive, because I had had some problems prior to arrival with being double booked on a non-refundable rate. Long story short, I ended up having to file a credit card dispute and got my money back. Needless to say, I was prepared for a lukewarm welcome. When we arrived, it was exactly the opposite. The staff at Exedra made amends by upgrading our room to a room with a wonderful view of the Piazza della Repubblica and the fountain in the middle. They also gave us a dining credit at Tazio (the hotel restaurant) for a meal worth up to 261 Euros. I was shocked and it was a great start to the trip. Although the restaurant had a very limited menu, we thoroughly enjoyed our free meal. Several times, we left the room briefly in the morning or afternoon for a quick meal and put the \"please make up the room\" sign on the door, and every single time the room was made up when we returned. One time, we were gone only 15-20 minutes, and the room was still completely made up. We appreciated this prompt service. The rooftop pool was wonderful and relaxing, giving great views of the city from above. The one complaint I have is that it was FREEZING. A heated pool would be nice, as I could barely sit in it for an extended period of time. Not many hotels in Rome have a pool, period, let alone one on top of the roof! Finally, I have to say that the concierge desk was probably the highlight of our trip, always ready and willing to help and providing us with valuable information on the surrounding area and restaurants.

The hotel gave us an upgraded room from a standard to superior room when we checked in. We met the hotel manager on at least 4 occassions around the hotel and each time he enquired if we were having a good time and if our room was good. He gave us his business card the first time we met and remembered he had met us before on the other occassions. The air condidtioning was the best we have experienced in any 5 star hotel, easy to alter and kept a constant temp with very little noise. The pool is deceptive on the hotel images (smaller than) and quite shallow. There is a forced water jet that is designed to swim against (like an excercise bike, you don't go anywhere) it's clean, not busy and not too cold, it's not a critism,of the hotel just don't expect too much and you will be happy with the set up. There are approximately 10 beds around the corner to sun bathe and we managed to secure 2 everyday when we returned from sightseeing without any problems. So for a city center hotel you have spacious, clean, cool rooms, a pool and somewhere to sunbathe. Many options for eating and drinking, although with the exchange rate and food costs rising- it worked out expensive. Via Veneto is 10 min walk away for guaranteed quality food every day. Environmentally friendly (for a 5 star) lights were all energy saving, the key system turned everything on/off as appropriate. Shampoos etc... were not thrown away everyday, new ones were left when necessary and the usual with towels. We had a superb experience here and would recomend it to friends and family.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barnsley, Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Exedra\u201d", "Author": "BFC333", "ReviewID": "UR18821135", "Content": "We stayed at the Exedra prior to a joining a Med cruise.

I staid there for 4 night from July 27-31. There are a couple of good things about the hotel. It is very close to the train station and everything else is in close proximity or can be easily reached. Let's first start with the rooms... the room I got and the other ones did not look any better are just small (room 281) and just fits the bed, 2 nightstands and a desk with chair. This is still acceptable (same as the minibar prices: Small coke & euro), but I am expecting a little bit more from a 5 star hotel than dirty/damaged faucets or a chipped porcellain soap holder. Ok, the funny thing was the toilet. I am 6'4\" and unfortunately had to sit a little bit sideways on the toilet, because it was directly built next to the sink. Ok, and it would have needed a Houdini to reach the toilet paper :-)). That's the room. If you look a little bit outside your room and do not use the elevator, you will notice that the carpet on the stairs needs urgently either to be exchanged or deep cleaning.

I had a great room overlooking the Piazza Republicana. The hotel is opulent, in a grand building, and everything has a freshness of new construction mixed with old world charm. On the surface, it approaches five star opulence. The electronics in the room are dated (regular TV's, about 15\" in size) and the lights are all environmentally correct fluorescent - which makes the room have a \"classroom\" type of ambience due to the strobing of the lighting. Here's where it falls short: 1) the beds are rock hard and very uncomfortable. Sleeping on it makes you feel really beat up in the morning, and you find yourself shifting around a lot to get comfortable. 2) The menus were missing. When I called room service to ask, they said that \"they didn't have enough for the whole hotel\", and he offered to read me each menu item one by one. I asked for a menu instead, and he said they would have to search vacant rooms to find one, and this would take a while. So we just winded up ordering club sandwiches, and they were very good. Secondly, the front desk never answers. There are two buttons on your phone - one is for \"guest service\" the 2nd is for room service. Guest service never answers, and room service can't help you because there are no menus! I wound up calling from an outside line using SKYPE to see if I could get anybody to answer (as in - prospective guest) and there was no answer. Tried for hours - no answer. This hotel is very spread out so to walk down to the front desk would be a drag. I can only imagine if there was a flood in the toilet or something, what would you do? I'm sure this is a temporary thing, but there is construction in the lobby with a lot of hammering, and it is very very loud. Oh also - it took about 45 minutes to get the bags to our room. The nice lady at the front desk took our claim check, so we couldn't find a way to tell them which bags were ours. It is a shame because this hotel is so beautiful.

Also heard breakfast is abit of a rip off so I'd suggest you head next door to Maccy D's and grab a coffee and a pastry for 5 euros (this is for 2!!) Perfect location for exploring Rome, everything is about a 10-15 minute walk away. Suggest getting the open top buses, brilliant and get to see so much more. Only quibble was the roof terrace...beautiful and pool perfect for a dip so you can cool down, but you can never get on the sun loungers. It would have been nice to relax in the sun but everytime we went up there they were taken, have to point out there are only 8, so you end up having to sit on chairs which aren't very comfortable.

Good hotel, great big room with huge bed. Fabulous finish to the room, and we really felt like we were in Rome thanks to the sympathetic decor.

Was much faster at 30mins transfer and approx \u00a310pp. We were also pretty much able to walk anywhere in Rome from the hotel (not in heels though!) The roof area is 'bijou' shall we say. The pool and sunbathing area are very small and I wouldn't recommend this hotel if sunbathing is a big part of your agenda. Perhaps the Radisson Es might be more appropriate. Though it is nice that they have this space if you did want to catch a couple of hours in the sun/pool. You might have to wait a couple of hours for one of the 8 sun loungers though. (There are also some chairs and cabanna sytle seats available) My breakfast tip would be: Do not order breakfast here at 30 Euros pp, instead wander down to Tazio which is still part of the hotel, sir outside and order a couple of cappucinos (or any coffee or tea) and they bring a little dish with mini croissants and pain au chocolats. Plenty to fill a hole until lunch! Service frankly is abominable. But then it's not exactly super high in the rest of Rome either.

The Exedra was taken from a list of about 3 or 4 other 5stars in Rome that we decided to go to celebrate New Year and our second Wedding anniversary. Russie and Eden were booked up and the Exedra offered a better room with a New Year gala dinner thrown in so thats what we went for. Arranged for a car from the airport (Ciampino) which made a whole lot of sense particulalry as the queues for the Bus transfers looked ugly and the taxis werent too numerous. Arrived to a fabulous looking Crescent of a building facing the Pza de republica ( a big roundabout) . Checkin was a breeze and the customer Service director made a point of introducing himself, nice touch. teh room was a junior suite overlooking the roundabout, great views from enormous Windows. The suite was very nice although the upstairs/Mezzanine Lounge area wasnt much used. Dont know how much a normal room is but if you dont spend lots of time in the room maybe not worth the extra for a suite, although the view was great. The New Year gala dinner was great, 7 courses of very well cooked and presented contemporary Italian cuisine. This is the only meal we had at the Hotel but if this is the standard of the kitchen i would guess you are going to eat well here. Entrance lobby and Bar areas are nice places to be. We went to look at the Hassler on the Spanish steps and found it very old fashioned and a bit tired in comparison. Location - Literally 5 mins walk from Termini station ( once you know where you are going). Great for getting on the sightseeing buses that start here (make sure your headphones work before you settle on a seat, its long journey in silence) not so easy coming the other way from the station with luggage unless you know which way you are heading and dont mind dodging Roman Traffic. We caught the Metro once from directly outside the hotel, this has a limited service but is probably the quickest way fo getting you to the Vatican. We also walked down to Piazza Venezia which took about 10-15min of reasonably brisk walking downhill. All in all a great city break over the New Year Period, would recommend the hotel to anyone who likes a bit of luxury without all the stuffiness. Concierge were great recomended a fantastic Seafood restaurant 10 mins taxi ride away ( Hosteria de Pesce) Downsides - There are definetly nicer parts of town, not that its rough necessarily just not much going on and a bit of a trek to go anywhere. We should perhpas have used taxis and Metro more to save our aching feet.

We booked a Deluxe room as only this grade of room and Junior Suites have a view of the Piazza Della Republica, and this was important to me. The room was probably the best I have ever stayed in - very large and grand with extremely high ceilings, elegant furnishings, a balcony overlooking the Piazza & fountain. The bathroom was good, with marble, double sink, a huge bath, seperate shower cubicle and luxury toiletries. There is probably nothing I could suggest that would make the room any more perfect. The lobby is particularly stunning (I believe that it featured in the movie Oceans 12!) and the Tazio restaurant / champagne bar is classy in a more modern way. I would definitely recommend eating here once during a visit - service is excellent and the food is elegantly presented yet has fairly large portions and is not outrageously priced. Other reports mention extortionate drinks prices but we found them to be OK considering the class of hotel. We both had massages in the Spa, which is a beautifully relaxing and tranquil haven. However, due to the fact that I was expecting perfection, inevitably there were a couple of niggles: - based on the experiences of Tripadvisor reviewers, I had hoped that I may get some 'special' treatment as it was my 40th birthday. Although the receptionist congratulated me on check-in, there was no other token - even a card would have been nice. Previous travellers have talked of champagne, flowers, room upgrades etc. - our package included limo transfers from/to the airport, but the vehicle that collected us on our arrival was actually a mini-bus that smelled badly of smoke - not exactly the luxury arrival that I had expected. The return was better - a small Mercedes car. Strangely, the hotel seems to have it's own luxury limo service but had sub-contracted out our transfers (maybe being on a 'package' meant that we were not as important as other guests?) - No turn down service or scented candles that had been mentioned in other reviews. - Bloody Marys not available in the bar as some of the ingredients had run out. Not what you expect of a 5* hotel, have they not heard of shops? - Room service breakfast card was not replaced on the 2nd day so we went down to eat. We were about to be given an a la carte menu but this was withdrawn once we gave our room number (I guess because our package included breakfast). The guests at the next table were able to order a la carte and, again, I felt like a 2nd class citizen. Buffet breakfast was very good however. - One dinner was included in our package.

I had previously stayed at the St Regis down the street, which is more expensive but has smaller rooms - however, the St Regis is more elegant, less modern than the Exedra. During my stay at the Exedra, the internet connection in the room didn't work and they do not have a business center (I ended up going to the front desk to use the computer there at midnight!). When I had called earlier to ask about the internet connection, the man at the front desk was not apologetic but matter of fact - 'Nothing can be done. You can use the computer down here.' In the end, he was friendly as I left the area but until that point had not been terribly friendly, even though he should have been given the circumstances. The staff wasn't terrible but perhaps indifferent (the concierge didn't really help me when I asked about museum reservations - I could have called the same numbers myself so obviously they are not well connected with museum staff). The bellstaff took over an hour to get our luggage to our room so don't rely on them to bring your things in a timely fashion (they simply deposited the bags in an unlocked room to the side of the entrance and forgot about them - this is an obvious security hazard!). However, because I encountered so many rude and crazy taxi drivers in Rome, the staff at the Exedra didn't seem so bad! The bathroom was huge and also beautiful but I found bugs on two occasions. Two different types of bugs - one mini-roach and a sort of gnat. Not pleasant. Despite these problems, I will probably stay at the Exedra again because the rooms are pretty huge and it is worth it for the amount you are paying. However, I will remember to bring bug spray! Another note - on our last night there we smelled smoke in the lobby. Although we hesitated to go to our rooms, we were assured all was well despite the fact that we were told a 'towel fire' had gotten out of hand an hour before.

The Termini has a lot of shops there, including a supermarket, and so everything you would need is right on your doorstep. We were made to feel very welcome at the hotel and a great fuss was made of the baby, not just by the staff, but by a lot of people we met whilst in Rome, something us reserved Brits don't tend to do, so it made a nice change. The staff were polite, spoke excellent English and couldn't have been more helpful. The Concierge was happy to recommend restaurants to visit and although one was great (Target) the other (Flavia) was awful, and not content with the tiniest portions of food i've seen, tried to overcharge us by 40 Euros! Our hotel room was beautiful, complete with tall ceilings, lounge area and spacious marble bathroom.

We had a roll-away for one child and the other slept on two chairs pushed together. Although we booked our room through travelocity for 2 adults and two children I don't think the hotel would normally allow four to a room. The room was not ready when we arrived but they upgraded us to a superior room for no extra charge. The location was great and we were able to walk everywhere. The hotel is not right by the spanish steps but very walkable. We had no problems with gypsies as others have said. The pool was small and was not heated so our kids did not use it. The tv had three english channels. BBC, CNN and MTV which is typical for europe. The concierge was unhelpful and often made peculiar suggestions for meals so we usually found places to eat on our own. My only complaint about the room was the bed was fairly hard for my taste and was two twin beds made up as a king. The linens were very nice and the towels and bath products first rate (however they did not have a separate conditioner so bring your own if you use it). We did not eat the breakfast as it was not included in our rate. It was about 26 euros per person including children so we found pastries nearby. The hotel offers complimentary snacks in the lobby all day which was real nice. They would usually have biscotti, white and dark chocolate, dried fruit and nuts out to eat all day. Our families loved Rome. We went on a day trip to Pompeii and to Positano which was a real treat. We used Armando from Italyprivatetours. He was very nice and knowledgable. He took us to the vatican and the colliseum as well. At times he had a little too much info for our kids but definately made our trip more fun. Our children are 10 and 13 and they all had a great time. The Exedra was a great place to stay. The services were a little lacking but the room was great and very clean. It may not be a 5 star by U.S. standards but for Europe it is very nice. We got a great rate and would stay there again if we got a good rate again. Attached is a photo from our room.

It is a 5 star hotel. The staff are friendly and laid back, not obtrusive but attentive to your needs at the same time. The rooms and facilities in general are excellent. The bar is a little lifeless but I've found that in all 5 star hotels I've stayed in. Must be because they are exclusive and pricey. Nevertheless it's a great place to stay. There are a couple of shady characters who loiter in the surrounds of the hotel. I was approached by a pimp. But the area is busy and I happened to be stood alone at the corner of the hotel, a single man late at night. It was all relatively harmless, I just brushed him off. The hotel is a 5 - 10 min walk from Termini. The station area is well lit and very busy at all times with people coming and going and not in the least bit intimidating. Unlike Kings Cross in London for example. Taxi's in Rome are relatively cheap which was contrary to what I was led to believe. You can get anywhere in the centre for 7 euro. We used the cab to cross the river to Trastevere at night and were charged a little over 7 euro which was good value. They are all metered anyway. Rome itself is a great place to go. Lots to see and do. The Italians are relaxed and friendly. Food is generally cheap. Meal for three, three courses (pasta, pizza, ice cream) and wine and water and tea for about 70 euro in total in a nearby restaurant. Don't eat at Flann O'Brien's, it's a dump. It's popular but Irish and British theme pubs when abroad are generally poor value. Overpriced, bad service. We did several day trips the one I would recommend most is Naples/Capri with Gray Line/Panorama tours. Ferry to Capri, motorboat to Blue Grotto, chairlift to top of mountain on Anacapri through the mist with spectacular views at the top. Great fun. I'd recommend a guided tour of the Vatican Museums and Cistine Chapel. A guide brings it to life. One note of caution. Forewarned I kept a close eye on my wallet. However, on Easter Sunday myself, younger brother and mum took the metro towards the Vatican. The metro was jam packed. When we got off my mum discovered her handbag was open and her purse was missing. She suspected a young girl of 14 who was with hher mother and they both got off one stop after we got on.

Our room on the third floor overlooked a car park and was a very long walk and then a marble staircase to the lift. Not too good for those with mobility problems. We tried using a staircase that was closer to our room but it was filthy: very dusty, the floor strewn with cigarette ends. The facilities are pretty good. Our room was serviced twice a day, as you would expect in this kind of hotel, and the lobby and lounge were impressive, but in our room standards fell: we had to ask four times for our bathroom floor to be cleaned. By the time the cleaner finally appeared, two days after our first request, I had washed them off myself but still insisted she cleaned the floor on principle! The price of the room also included breakfast. We were not offered breakfast vouchers when we checked in and had to ask for them. Had we not known breakfast was included in the price we would have paid for breakfast without knowing it was included. Breakfast was in a lovely modern room and there was a well stocked buffet; if only they had used locally cooked bread rather than the partially baked bread rolls that you take home to bake yourself. It is the little things that count in a good hotel. My husband became really annoyed by the TV screens that are everywhere in the building and the same piece of music they play repeatedly in the corridors. Someone please tell hotel management to change the tape. It really grates after a few days. When we arrived we asked the desk for an iron and ironing board. We were told they did not supply one, and that we had to ask the concierge to iron our clothes - at a price - plus tip, no doubt. It cost 8 euros for one shirt to be ironed, so we went out and bought an iron for the same money and ironed our own clothes on a towel. On our penultimate day, we were phoned around 11.00pm in our room by the front desk who wanted to know if we wanted to book a car to the airport the following day.

We asked for a taxi to be provided and they did everything they could to persuade us not to book one, but to go for the more expensive option. In the end, after two or three more phone calls, we told them not to bother: it was late and we just wanted to go to bed. (The following day we travelled to the airport by train - the station is only a short walk away). However, before leaving the hotel we left our luggage with the concierge so we could do some last minute shopping. When we returned we were handed our coats and bags in an absolutely filthy state. I think they must have been thrown on a dusty floor - but what annoyed me even more was there was neither an apology nor any attempt to clean them for us. The woman at the desk saw the dust, heard me complain to my husband and put her head down and pretended she hadn't seen it. The look of sorrow when we wouldn't tip the concierge had to be seen to be believed. Our overwhelming feeling on leaving the hotel was that this was a missed opportunity. The building and the facilities are excellent but the staff could do with some serious training in customer care before they can be said to give more than a 2* service.

She wanted to charge me 85 Euros for each ticket for seats in the back plus a \"something for them\" for getting me the tickets. No problem-right. Wrong, tickets were not sold out, every place I looked after walking around for a few hours was selling them on either Friday or Saturday night!!! The day we visited the Vatican we headed downstairs at 7:00am for breakfast as you need to get to the Vatican by 8:00am in order to avoid the long lines.

Service in restaruant just OK. Although inside the hotel is very clean the red carpet outside is filthy and garbage all around the entrance. When I asked the bell hop to call a taxi he argued with the driver about his commission in front of me. Beautiful hotel, terrible service.

If you are going to Rome in the summer beware of the heat, it is brutal and most stores close during this time so having a rooftop pool was truly a plus.

The Piazza de Republica is pleasant so disregard any comments in AA guide which in my opinion is not the most useful guide to Rome( it does not mention this hotel ) and its maps are hard to read.", "Date": "April 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201c5-star Luxury at Roman 4-star prices\u201d", "Author": "GlobalVenturer", "ReviewID": "UR1805694", "Content": "We spent Easter 2004 in Rome and opted for this hotel based on the great reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed. We were given a fabulous room on the 4th floor overlooking the fountain in the Piazza de la Republicca. The room and hotel is exactly what you would expect of a 5-star luxury property... plenty or marble, comfortable bed (the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever had!), huge room, great views, excellent service etc etc. The only problem we had was with our door lock - the key card did not work. Upon notifying the reception staff, this was remedied immediately. Highly recommended and will definitely go back. Final note - the in-room minibar prices are outrageous (Euro 9 for a Coke?!) but the lobby bar abd restaurant downstairs had competitive prices with external restaurants.", "Date": "April 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cLuxury at great value!\u201d", "Author": "Londonfamily", "ReviewID": "UR1784882", "Content": "We stayed at the Exedra in February half term and would strongly recommend it to anyone. The room rate was much cheaper than any of the othr luxury hotels in Rome and they were quite happy for our 10 and 13 year old children share our room. Quite rare in Europe, especially where kids are over 12. Otherwise we would have needed two rooms...very expensive. The decor was stylish and the room was huge. Bathroom beautiful. We tended to eat out. The concierge was most helpful and directed us to some great restaurants, although one was a little strange....sadly can't remember its name...not helpful I know. Breakfast buffet in restaurant was not too goo and overpriced. Fra better to have breakfast in champagne bar on ground floor. Croissants juice and coffee for 7 euros. We asked for more of everything and they didn't charge any extra! All the staff are very helpful and pleasant. We did find that we had to get taxis to most places but it was worth it becuase the htoel was much better value than those which were slightly more central.", "Date": "April 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1776512", "Content": "Stayed at the Exedra the weekend of 10 April 2004.

Despite the rave reviews on this site that set our expectations high, we were truly surprised and delighted: the service was top-notch, the room unusually spacious (by Rome standards), the bathroom a delight and the decor refreshingly 'classical' modern. The concierge couldn't have been more helpful - booking us in to the most fabulous restaurants, arranging transport and representing my interests very strongly with an airline that had managed to lose my luggage. On that subject, I experienced wonderful service - overnight tailoring - from Angelo at the Esedra boutique across the piazza from the hotel. I will definitely be returning to the Exedra soon - if only to luxuriate in the roof-top swimming pool when the weather warms up a little.", "Date": "April 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1758732", "Content": "My wife and I stayed in the Exedra in March 2004. The hotel is beautiful with friendly and helpful staff. The buffet breakfast is impressive (although at &#8364;22 per person it should be). One could not ask more from a hotel. It was a pleasure to come back after walking all over Rome to relax in the huge sofas near the lobby over with a refreshing drink. The hotel is well located: a metro station is just outside the front door It takes approximately 15-20 minutes to get to the Vatican by metro (including a walk at the other end). And the hotel is about 10-15 minute walk from the Forum. (As an aside the best form of public transport in Rome is the bus given that the metro has only two lines, so is somewhat limited. However, we ended up working most of the time!) It was too cold to swim in the hotel's outside swimming pool, but it is located on the roof terrace on the fifth floor and is well desgined. The roof terrace is surrounded by a glass-barrier giving you an unrestricted view over Rome and giving you the impression that you could swim off the roof.
