It was Mum's first big trip overseas, and this hotel was the perfect place to bring her. The fact that it is not a sterile, minimalist hotel means a lot - it has character and charm. Breakfast on our patio was lovely, overlooking the gardens and neighbouring houses. A sure antidote to crazy days of sightseeing and travel on the Metro. Our twin room was sufficiently large, beautifully decorated, beds were comfy, bathroom was spotless. The fact that my Mother had just had a knee replacement meant that getting in and out of the bath (no shower) was a challenge, but travelling poses many challenges and she took it in her stride. The other great thing is that the hotel is on the quiet side of Montmartre, not on the tourist beat. This meant we felt part of a neighbourhood rather than just another pair of travellers. The friendly Cafe Au Relais just down the road from the hotel contributed to this with their down to earth service, homely food, delicate wines and punchy coffee.

Like one of the other reviewers, I brushed off my schoolgirl French and telephoned the owners, only to find that Madame spoke good English! She was absolutely charming and when I said that we would be celebrating my 50th birthday that weekend, she said that she would book us into one of the rooms with the terrace.Walking up from the Metro on a hot July afternoon wasn't as gruelling as it might have been - I don't think my husband or I had realised how close to Sacre-Coeur we would be staying but there it was, floating like a huge ornate meringue above us! The welcome at the hotel was one of the warmest we have ever experienced. The room was perfect (huge armoire and plenty of hangers!), the bathroom quirky but once we had mastered the art of showering without soaking the bathroom (over-bath shower), we were fine!Our breakfast each morning was served on the pretty terrace - the window-cill was low enough to hop out of the tall window. The coffee and croissants or baguettes were fresh and delicious.We were at the back of the hotel with views over the skyline of Paris and despite the fact that France was playing Italy in the World Cup Final on my birthday, we weren't disturbed by noise.We have both said that we would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat - Paris in the Spring would be good!", "Date": "Oct 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR202806410", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Menolly56"}, {"Content": "Loved it!

The area around Lamarck-Caulaincourt is very charming and it easily feels as if you are one of the locals.The room was very small but sooo charming with flowered walls and matching bedspreads, so we didn't really mind. I mean, we had no intention of spending our Paris stay hiding in the hotel room!.. A big armoir swallowed all our clothes which also was good... And the view from the window was splendid overlooking a small backyard and the whole of Paris. We woke up each morning to the birds chirping and the sun in our eyes :) The small kitchenette and the (small) bathroom were very fresh and nice. There was no cooking plate, but a microwave where you could make your food.The only thing that could bother us were the pillows (more like tubes) and the fact that the walls weren't exactly sound proof. That actually seems to be very common in Parisian hotels, though. The fact that you have to walk a bit from the metro to get there (which some of the reviews say) didn't bother us a bit!The staff was helpful and the cleaning was great!That studio was perfect and we felt as if we had our own little place above the rooftops in Paris :) I would definitely stay there again, even if I didn't get that studio.

This small hotel is outstandingly good value.Staying at the Ermitage is a delight. It is a small hotel with very friendly staff, who speak English well and give French lessons as they prepare breakfast. All the little touches. The breakfast is quaint and continental with freshly baked croissants, bottomless bowls of chocolat chaude, and proper cups of coffee. The whole place feels authentically French and catapulted straight out of some Moulin Rouge bohemian dreamworld. The style is art nouveau with authentic charm, gilded chandeliers, checkerboard floors, and a lot of textured fabric on the walls, all of which giving the place a very rich sensual feel. Our bedroom had an enormous amount of personality and unique character- it felt opulent and decadent, whilst cosy and intimate. A truly unique hotel at an extremely reasonable price. The hotel has Lonely Planet and Rough Guide guide books which can be borrowed for the duration of your stay, and the steps of the Sacre Coeur are just metres away... and from there atop Montmartre , breathtaking views of the most celebrated romantic city.

The rooms are beautiful, fabric walls, heavy doors and a free breakfast of croissants, coffee, etc. But don't plan on lounging in your room all day because they want you to leave by 11:30am or noon so they can clean the rooms and they'll call you to ask, when you sortie? Rooms, by the way, they clean better than any hotel I've ever stayed in, but they touch your things and rearrange everything, just, I think, to be super tidy. They are very nice and helpful in that French way. You must stay as long as you've promised as I heard others try and leave early to much dismay and their deposit taken.

However, since getting to know the wonderful family who runs the hotel (Maggie, Dominique, etc.), I decided to stay a total of 5 nights with side trips to other parts of France in my total stay of 2 weeks. The rooms were decorated so beautifully in old-style Parisian decor and the hotel is only 2 blocks away from the famous Sacre Cour cathedral. The area is quiet and clean and there are numerous restaurants and shopping nearby. The metro is a short walk as well. The family\u9e93s hospitality was tremendous, and I found myself looking forward to the hot chocolate and croissants outside my door every morning. Maggie was especially helpful with planning the side trips and you immediately sense her pride in this truly beautiful city.Montemarte, the area where the hotel is located has a very bohemian feel to it (Picasso, Hemingway and Renoir all lived here at one point). I believe one of them said of the flowered wall paper typical of Parisian rooms ... either the wall paper goes or I go.. right before he died.. At the risk of sounding morbid, I mention it because the rooms definitely reflect this decor motif, adding to the whole experience of Montemarte.I definitely recommend this hotel if you ever have an opportunity to explore Paris.

Sophie and Maggie were very accomodating and were as friendly as ever. Our room was immaculate every time we returned. The clean staff folded our clothes and put them in the closet. No maid in the US would ever do that!The Montmartre neighborhood is just wonderful! And the value was fine. I was warned that hotels in France are not what Americans are used to, so I was prepared for anything.The location of the Ermitage is tricky though and although we enjoyed our stay we probably won't return. I will book much farther in advance and get an even better location.When returning from long days of walking around Paris (which you walk about 5 miles a day), Montmartre is in a very hilly neighborhood and the walk from the Metro to the Ermitage is approximately a 5 block walk uphill. I am in very good shape and don't mind, but this would be bad for someone not in shape. Also Montmartre is loaded in stairs. Don't stay in this neighborhood if you have trouble with them.The Metro is a very easy way to travel around Paris. It is almost identical to the New York City subway system and maps are posted everywhere. It is also a good way to get around on a budget only costing about 2 Euro a day.The bed we had at the Ermitage was not the most comfortable either, and the pillows are not standard pillows. Now to get to the funky part.....the bathroom. If you are taller then 5'10 and are larger then 140lbs then look for another hotel. The bathroom we had was teeny weeny. My huband who is slender and 6' tall had quite a challenge. When on the toilet your knees come out the front door. If you want to shut the door then you have to sit sideways. Then there is the bathtub that is not meant to stand in. You can practically kill yourself in it. It does not have a level floor. It is meant to sit in it with your knees up in front of you. Needless to say, it was very very uncomfortable.Also, in regards to the breakfast, it consists of only, coffee, tea, or hot chocolate and a small baguette with jelly  butter and a croissant. Not exactly a breakfast to get through a busy morning on. There are, however, creperies in the square on the other side of the Sacre Coeur.Wear very comfortable walking shoes, otherwise you'll regret it!However, We were in Paris none the less, and who could complain about that!!", "Date": "Oct 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR476599320", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Winddancer1"}, {"Content": "Warmth  This charming hotel, was more than accomodating to my family as we traveled through Paris enroute to Dijon this past June.
