There is also another restaurant where the menu is more expensive and more upmarket. During warmer months the hotel has a good size swimming pool with pool chairs surrounding it. The nearest metro station (Namur) is a 5 minute walk away (on the same side of the road) and from this station you can reach all the main tourist areas without changing trains. The weekend we were in Montreal was the Grande Prix, so the whole city was crowded for the big event. We caught the hop on-hop off bus (with a live commentary) which gave us a good 2 hour tour both in the city and it's surroundings - getting to places we, otherwise, wouldn't have easily reached.. During the summer they have more buses running so the wait is far less - but in the spring and autumn they seem to only have 2 buses so you can wait as long as an hour before the next bus comes along. The hotel is about a 20 minute ride from the main international airport. It is a large hotel and lies back from the busy main road - we couldn't hear any trafic noise in our room.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Canada", "Title": "\u201cClean, Friendly, Efficient\u201d", "Author": "dagobert2010", "ReviewID": "UR67573474", "Content": "Just spent 4 nights with family during Grand Prix weekend.

I've stayed at this hotel more than a half dozen times... always out of necessity. If I had a choice, I would avoid it. I've had a better rooms at more affordable prices at the airport (Aloft Montreal) or in the city (InterContinental Montreal). I share the following for the benefit of readers, and to hopefully put pressure on the hotel management to make reasonable changes where possible. SLOW INTERNET - Needs Broadband Simply inexcusable. Whether you're wireless or not, there are two versions of Internet at this hotel. For $7 per day, you can get slow @ 250 kbps download. (For you non-geeks, that's about 10% the speed of a cable modem -- and is not classified as broadband by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.) Or you can choose the free SUPER slow @ 56 kbps dial up speed. It's really hard to tell the difference. Both are unbearable. If you're a business traveler who needs to work on a lap top, this is NOT a hotel for you. BAD DINING - Needs a Gordon Ramsey Overhaul The restaurants downstairs may look nice, but the food is awful. Trust me. Cafe dLux is really only good for morning coffee and pastries. Mahjongg Chinese Bistro is something even the front desk suggests you avoid. If you want Asian, you're better off walking a few blocks down to the Hot & Spicy. Other choices include Baton Rouge (the Canadian version of T.G.I. Fridays), which is a 10 min walk. Also, several greasy spoons and fast food joints are in walking distance. NO LATE NIGHT SNACKS - Needs vending with snacks It's really hard to believe. But this hotel has no vending machine or snacks anywhere on premise for late arrivals. Soda pop only. Need a cracker or bag of chips? The front desk will direct you to walk down the street. Not good when the weather is cold. FEW TV CHANNELS - Needs More US Channels While you do get an HDTV in your room, nearly half the channels are in French. And there is not a very wide selection. When I've stayed in the Caribbean or Mexico, I had more US channels than at Ruby Foo's. Not for the American traveler! CLIMATE CONTROL - Needs an HVAC upgrade Good luck getting your room a comfortable temperature. Upon arrival, the heat is usually cranked up to sauna levels. I blast the AC all night -- but I find it a struggle to keep the air at room temperature. FEW POWER OUTLETS - Needs more accessible power Not all. But MANY of the rooms have an odd arrangement that make it nearly impossible to plug in a device near the bed stand. So if you have a phone or portable alarm, it may have to stay in the bathroom or on the desk on the other side of your room. FREE/FULL PARKING - Needs to charge for conference parking There is a parking lot for which you need a free ticket to enter/exit. But if you're a guest coming in for a stay when a conference is being held, you may not find a spot. BAD LOCATION I stay in Montreal fairly regularly. While this hotel is bargain priced, it is on blvd. Decarie -- a $25 cab ride from the airport AND downtown. The road is raised above a highway. Crossing sides to reverse direction is quite an ordeal. Rush hour is always gridlock traffic, during which 15 min for 2 km is not uncommon.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "burlington VT", "Title": "\u201cNot so far off the beaten path\u201d", "Author": "jabburlingtonVT", "ReviewID": "UR42765310", "Content": "My husband & I stayed at Ruby Foo's while visiting relatives in Montreal.

I can't talk much about the location as we drove in pretty late from Toronto and I was in the back seat so have no clue what the proximity is to downtown. There were a few restaurants in the area, including you usual fast food choice of McDonalds and Burger King and I noticed a metro station just a 1/2 block away. The outside of the hotel itself looked like you typical hotel/motel off the highway. A short 3 or 4 level building. We had booked a standard \"non smoking room\". When were on the 3rd floor via a tiny elevator at took forever to get to - located on one end of the bulding furthest away from the lobby. The elevator was tiny and could fit 4-5 people with luggage at best. Turns out the one within a few feet of the lobby was a much nicer elevator - larger and newer, which of course led to the more expensive rooms. When we entered the room we were hit with the stench of smoke. I checked another 2 rooms that my co-workers were in to see if it were any better... not only was it not better, there was an ashtray and matches on the coffee table in one of the rooms. I went to the front desk and asked for another room. First off, I was told that I was indeed in a smoking room. But when I confronted the clerk and said that my next door neighbour's room had an ashtray and matches, the agent seemed almost embarrassed and didn't have anything further to say, except perhaps housekeeping made a mistake putting it in the room. I was told that the hotel was \"sold out\" for the night at that there were no rooms available. I went back to the room and fumed about it (sorry for the pun) but after a few minutes of trying to air it out by turning on the air conditioning to full blast, made another attempt at the front desk. The second person I spoke with at the front desk was more apologetic but still said there wasn't anywhere he could move me to for the night. I said that from where I come from (Vancouver) all the good hotels would put up guests in another hotel if they were not able to provide what they promised. Secondly I also asked how many rooms they had and asked to confirm that all categories of rooms are sold out. (Coming from the industry, I am always hesitant to believe that hotels sell out.) To which he admitted that the standard room categories were sold out but they had superior rooms and that I'd have to pay more for these rooms. He mentioned that this happens all the time (which can't be a good sign). He asked my if I were allergic to smoke etc. At this time, I was pretty annoyed... I personally am not allergic to smoke but since I don't smoke and have a legal right to get a non smoking room, don't see why my so called non smoking room smells of smoke and that they felt that I had to pay more to get a non smoking one. It's almost like getting penalized for not being a smoker. To make a really really long story short... I did get another room, though they made me felt like they were doing me a favour by upgrading me to a deluxe room. Though the new room was nicer, I would have been fine sleeping in the standard room had it not smelled of smoke. If I happen to stay here again, knowing what I know, I would personally opt to pay for the difference in the room just to get a nicer room.

As it turned out, the only hotel with air conditioning (somehow, it was over 90 degrees) was Ruby Foo's. The website made this proeperty out to be a little better than it really was. The positives for Ruby Foo's- near the metro, just off Hwy 15, close to airport, clean bed. The negatives for Ruby Foo's- pool closed, parking lot and entrance is a very dusty construction zone, rooms are dark and very noisy, in a questionable neighborhood, close to Hwy 15's terrible traffic, no cocktail lounge, rooms are kind of tired Howard Johnson-style. I can only blame myself for the situation of having to stay there and, if I returned, would receive a discount due to the renovation. However, it is most unlikely that I will ever visit Ruby Foo's again. Loved Montreal and will certainly return there. I have stayed in much worse than Ruby Foo's; once all their promised renovations are complete, this might be a touch better.

The rooms were recently redecorated and are quite lovely. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful! The area has developped recently, with many restaurants and shopping outlets. A major bonus is that the parking is free, and you can take the subway to downtown Montreal ( Way cheaper than paying for downtown parking!!) A beautiful new spa and fully equipped gym are on site in the hotel. I must have gained 5 pounds eating at one of the restaurants (La Tulipe Noire) The cheesecake and pastries are to die for! If you enjoy sushi, you have found the ideal spot. This hotel is really convenient because of it's location (close to Airport, and downtown). A real treasure!
