Anyway, it was fine for us but the room was very dark as there are only two small lights above the beds & a light in the little hallway. There was a double bed & a single bed. The bathroom was small to average size, but the shower was quite low down - it was just about ok for me & I am 5 foot 6 - also there was not much room in front of the toilet so you had to sit to one side...! The fire alarm actually went off at about 11pm on the Saturday night & went on for a while - there was no comment about this when we checked out. We did not spend much time in the room apart from actually sleeping & we did not eat at the hotel so could not comment on the breakfast offered - although it looked like a good deal - $15 for all you can eat buffet breakfast.

Tea/Coffee facilities was useless to me as there was no sachets of de-caf,so if I wanted a coffee I had to walk to a nearby cafe and get one made in a paper cup - yuk!

The hotel was picked for me by an economically minded associate in Australia. Well, you get what you pay for, and this was a good hotel for our needs. Very centrally located, an easy walk from Central Station, and about a 30 minute stroll from Circular Quay. The area has a few backpacker accommodations nearby which means that there are some cheap-eat places and a laundromat in striking distance too. The room was very basic, but fairly clean and well maintained. I was on the 10th floor (I believe 1013) and the room had two double beds and a TV. The bathroom was fine, good water pressure and quite clean. However, my colleague had a room (506) on the 5th floor (which I think was a smoking floor) and his room was in MUCH worse shape than mine. There was an enormous burn stain on the floor near the bathroom, and the overall feel of the room was much more 'worn'. There is no minibar in the room, though there is a small fridge. There is a vending machine in the lobby with all the minibar staples. There are plenty of convenience stores in the area. I bought a WiFi package while I was there and that worked fine, and it averaged out to about AUD 10/day. Breakfast was not included and we didn't feel inclined to try the $15 all you can eat breakfast buffet. I found the staff to be very helpful. 2 points to consider. (1) There is another Metro Hotel on the same street (300 Pitt) so when you are giving directions to someone, you have to specify the cross street (Campbell). (2) There do seem to be some renovations going on there at the moment. In the morning I would hear the sounds of vigorous duct-taping in the hallway, and by the time I left for the day, parts of the hallway were marked off and some sort of work was being done.

The first time, we had quite a positive experience. We stayed in a queen superior room, which was all right. It was actually rather good value for money, the location of the hotel is (and remains) excellent, and we did not have to deal with staff members. The second time, we were given what is possibly the smallest room we ever saw. A cupboard would have been more spacious. We did not care that much but it was certainly not pleasant. The third time was by far the worst - and definitely the last. We were given a very small room, which shared a door with a triple. We noticed this upon arrival but did not think it would be an issue. We were awaken at 3 am by a group of drunken guys staying next door, and shouting loudly at each others. After 10 minutes of this, we tried to ring reception three times - to no avail. One of us eventually got up and went down to reception. We explained what the problem was, and were initially told that nothing could be done. After making it clear that we would not accept this as an answer, the person on duty this evening reluctantly agreed to talk to the guys next door and to ask them to stop. They went on for another good 15 minutes. When we checked out and mentioned that, the only thing they could suggest was to offer us a free breakfast, which we refused. Having read other reviews, it was obviously the right choice. The only advantage of this hotel is its location.

The clerk sat there waving it around telling me about all this sort of stuff that seemed he did not know what he was talking about. I had to physically pull my card out of his hand and go find $100 cash for him to shut him up, sort of quite rude he was i thought. Finally got my card to get into my room, got into the elevator, read the instructions for using the lift, took a few minutes of trying before another guest had to do it for me telling me how to do it as it is a bit tricky and not exactly as instructions say. Finally got to our room, opened the door and thought i had entered the broom closet it was that small. Went in, barely enough room to put my suitcase. looked around the room, the bathroom was all moudly on the tiles, the privacy nib on the door doesnt work, who knows that that is for, set to privacy anyone can still enter the room. I couldnt stand the small space so went for a walk. Came back after dinner, went to have a shower, the shower was absolutely disgraceful, i couldnt get the right temperature, it was either too hot or too cold no matter how little i moved the tap, after many minutes of trying i finally got the temp right, then it went cold on me, another ocuple minutes of getting it right then it went hot on me so then i just had a cold shower in the end. The water pressure was terrible as well. Also the exhaust vent for the room in the bathroom was falling out of the ceiling. The toilet was that close to the wall there is no way to comfortably dit on it, i dont know how any over weight people could possibly use it, glad i was not over weight. I got dressed and started watching TV. half hour later i started getting cold, look up the book it said there were instruction on operating the aircon near by, couldnt find any. after a while i found this thermostat on the ceiling set to 10 degrees, i adjusted it to 24 and it absolutely stunk the room out so i turned it back to 10, took my power card out to turn the aircon off and went to bed after the smell cleared from having the door open for 10 minutes. At this point i was going to call reception and ask for another room but i had everything unpacked and was too late and couldnt be bothered so off to sleep i went. Next day i decided to go for a swim in the pool, tried to get up there but no luck, went to reception and they said they dont give access unless asked for, wasted more time. finally got up there after waiting for lift number 3 for about 5 minutes as that is the only lift to get up there. Once at the roof the pool was an absolute disgrace, freezing cold, dirty looking, the concrete surrounds were all cracked and in my opinion dangerous as could easily cut yourself on them. The spa was out of order as well, so that exercise of getting to the roof was another waste of time.

We have stayed at Menzies and Novotel Darling Harbour on previous visits to Sydney but much prefer Metro Sydney Central as better value and good location-not far to wharf areas and other attractions.

With few beds available this weekend, I took what I could find ... namely The Metro. I booked a standard double and having then read the reviews here, I regretted it. I shouldn't have worried. On arrival the staff were courteous and helpful and sorted out a booking problem I had. On booking they said they couldn't guarantee a non-smoking room, but they managed it. Even before I'd checked in, I'd been upgraded to a superior double/queen for some reason (I wasn't game to ask why). The room was small but clean and modern, as was the bathroom. Not a lot of storage space, probably due to the second double bed in the room .. yup TWO double beds. (But no plug for the bath) Facing Pitt St was a little bit noisy if the curtains were open but nothing that kept me awake or woke me up. (Try and get a rear facing room if you can... the view from the front isn't very scenic anyway) One of my friends was in a standard room and it too was clean and pleasant and the only difference was that the decor was a bit dated. They seem to have dropped the luggage storage fee which was good. All in all, with the location, the price and the amenities were all better than expected (and I've travelled a lot so I know a bad hotel when I see it).", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Sussex, England", "Title": "\u201cBad attitude Staff\u201d", "Author": "Alison6", "ReviewID": "UR8099464", "Content": "I stayed here for 4 nights at the end of my trip to Oz.
