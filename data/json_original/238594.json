I had a single room which was very small. Having found the hotel on TripAdvisor (and being impressed by the great ratings), I was prepared for a small room but it was somehow even a little smaller than I had expected. I would describe the size as the kind of space you'd imagine for a budget accommodation. Of course I didn't book the hotel to get a large room, so it was not of utmost importance, but there was not much room to move around. Despite being small, the room was very clean and tidy. Basic but modern, it had a nice bathroom and shower, and a mini bar. The bed was comfortable however my main gripe was that the hotel was extremely noisy. I was woken up several times each night by people walking along outside my room (not even talking particularly loudly). This was a real shame as it disturbed my sleep and I would have expected better sound proofing.

I did not enjoy the experience. My room was incredibly small. The bed was a twin and a half. The room was listed as having an area of 12 meters. I did not bring a tape measure, but this appeared to be an overestimation. I had just enough room for my suitcase beside the bed. I could not even sit comfortably at the desk because the chair could not be pushed back from the desk without hitting the bed. There wasn't even room for a chest of drawers. In addition, the room's only window looked out on an interior shaft that did not appear to be well-cared for. My biggest issue was with the hotel's visitation policy. The hotel does not allow any outside guests into rooms. This policy was explained to me at check-in, well after I could have changed my mind about my booking. A friend I haven't seen in several years traveled from Italy to meet up with me for a few days while I was in the city. He was unable to secure a room in the hotel. At 11 PM, the majority of the bars shut down in the city. The hotel would not let us go upstairs to hang out for a bit longer. In addition, early one afternoon, I asked one desk worker if we might be able to sit in the lounge and drink a bottle of wine I purchased from a local wine shop. I explained that we wanted to do this after 11 PM when the bars and restaurants closed. He said this would be fine. After returning to the hotel that night, however, the gentleman at the front desk turned us away. He said we could not use the lounge for this purpose. I explained to him that I had been given permission earlier in the day and explained that we just wanted to sit and relax a bit longer. Again, he said no. I am sure that hotel's prohibition on outside visitors has its reasons. Maybe they are trying to keep out the ridiculous number of prostitutes and drug dealers that walk that end of La Rambla at night. However, the policy goes a bit too far when it prohibits old friends from talking in the lounge area before midnight.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cAppalling Manager and service.\u201d", "Author": "River08", "ReviewID": "UR125120269", "Content": "Returned yesterday from three night stay.

Our rooms were both a standard and a superior, and they both exceeded our expectations. The standard was perfect overlooking a a quiet courtyard. The hardwood floors, corner combination of a shower, tub and spa was exceptional. The bathroom also was equipted with a bidet, spectacular tile and marble and satinless steel. We haven't seen many better(Perhaps the Omni Berkshire in New York City and this was the standard... The hotel is immaculate and the staff very helpful as other reviews indicated. We loved the location, just up La Rambla you will find the La Boqueria (City Famous Market) where one could spend hours admiring the food displays. A short walk up to the Placa de Catalunya will get you on the jump on and off buses for amazing tours of the city and it's culture, history and architecture. Folks... don't walk, run to Barcelona and the Hotel Montecarlo. The second stay, post cruise.. we were upgraded to a superior room. We had a balcony on La Rambla to people watch and enjoy the flavor of this VERY SPECIAL CITY. This time we had a suite.... imagine, we actually tried to talk the staff into assigning is the same room we occupied two weeks earlier, they insisted we were paying for a superior and wanted us to experience that level. Well, we were blown away !! The first stay was at a peak period, the second, was not. However, forget the price... if you want an extrordinary hospitality experience... You will get it at the Montecarlo. We will be returning again. Two minor issues... one we were advised to use the Red \"On and Off\" Tour Buses and pre-purchased 2 day tickets. We eventually had to stand in long lines and had difficulty boarding the buses on when we wished. A competitor bus company appeared to be much better equipped and staffed.

It is right on the Las Ramblas but is incredibly quiet and is a wonderful place to get away from the busy street outside. The rooms are spacious by European standards and the staff were very helpful. The hotel is exceptionally clean and well maintained. Breakfast was fairly ordinary but perhaps to be expected as the Spanish traditionally do not make breakfast a big event. I am not sure I would choose the hotel breakfast if there were other options but the Spanish have no great love of breakfast so there were not really other viable easy alternatives. Would stay there again without hesitation in the future. Some useful info: The \"Aeroport\" (shuttle) bus from the Airport drops you at the main plaza (Plaza Catalunya) - about 5.50 euros one way. This is no more than 200m from the hotel.

Not sure why he felt the need to reprimand us again?!

The Hotel Montecarlo was a great place to stay in Barcelona. We loved Barcelona and we loved the hotel. The only negative thing I have to say is that when we checked in we were told we did not have breakfast included on the third night of our stay, which was incorrect. It's a good thing I brought copies of my emails and what I had prepaid. They were quite insistent about it at first so it was good I had brought the proof to show them they were incorrect. That was the only negative experience at the hotel. The staff is extremely helpful and we loved the location. They recommended the Tapas bar Cuidad Condal when we first arrived and it was excellent. Due to the time of our arrival we were going out to eat at 11:30 pm and found the place packed! There was even a short wait. We did the hop on, hop off bus, spent time at Segura Familia and Park Guell. We went to a flamenco show one night and visited the Magic Fountain. La Boqueria is practically across the street and a great experience to walk around there. We were in Barcelona during the protests. It was packed in Catalunya Square and on one day the streets were all closed around there and some public transportation was disrupted around the square. Our hotel room was very quiet and comfortable, located on La Rambla which was packed with people at all times. We loved walking around the city and seeing all the Gaudi architecture. The bathroom was especially nice with a jetted tub and nice shower. The bed was fine for us (we have a Temperpedic bed so somewhat used to a bed like this), but we heard others complain. Loved the free wifi. We were prepapred for pick pockets as I use a PacSafe purse, and my husband has a PacSafe neck pouch. Barcelona was definitely one of the highlights of our trip and I know we will be back. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to others.

The very warm welcome at the front steps was repeated at reception by enthusiastic, smiling, positive and professional staff. Our accommodation [Rm 310] is generously sized. It has three separate areas - bedroom with balcony overlooking La Rambla, sitting area and large bathroom. The adjustable bed was comfortable and the double glazed windows with lots of curtaining and blinds guaranteed that street noise did not intrude. Breakfast was generous, high quality, varied and very welcome. It was served in a light-filled, marble-floored and glass-walled elegant area by more committed and smiling staff - always cheerful generous with their assistance. The hotel has real character and the conversion has been completed with care and sympathy. A wander around the first floor reveals beautiful areas and underlines the pride the staff has for their hotel. The staff is quite exceptional and they contributed hugely to our memorable stay - just great! Nothing was too difficult for them and their recommendations for trips and restaurants were accurate and appreciated. As travelers to all continents and 75 countries, staying from no star to 5 star plus, we can say with confidence that if every hotel was run like this one, there would be no need for Trip Advisor! This Hotel certainly deserves the reviews it receives.

We had a beautiful room at the front of the hotel with a large balcony and a view of the Ramblas- it was spacious and modern - the jacussi bath was perfect for relaxing after a day's walking and the beds were also very comfortable. One of the best aspects of the hotel is the staff - probably the most helpful and friendly I have ever experienced travelling. . .we were offered breakfast in bed every day at no extra cost and they remembered us each morning and asked about our plans and offered helpful advice. This hotel is perfect for couples who are interested in sightseeing and who want to be close to lively bars and restaurants - the hotel becomes an oasis of calm to return to. It does not have a restaurant in the evening and as such is not the type of hotel you would go back to for a drink or to meet people. This was perfect for us but may not be for those who want a lively hotel - they want the best for the customers staying there and their priority is that you have everything you need - peace and tranquility especially. Here are some tips .. . take the bus from airport rather than taxi to Plaza Catalunya - it is a 5 min walk to hotel - but on return if you have taken an easyjet plane from uk CHECK your terminal - many many people end up having to get a bus from terminal 1 to 2 then have to run to Easyjet terminal C - very confusing. Take the bus touristica and pay for it from hotel - you get a discount. Dont forget to go up to see the roof garden at top of hotel beautiful views Must sees- Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, Montjuic, la Boqueria market on Las Ramblas Check prices on las ramblas before you sit to order food or drinks - many are overpriced and remember that it is cheaper to eat in tapas bar at bar than outside on terrace although the peoplewatching is probably worth the extra cost. Pickpockets - I was very anxious about this but you simply need to keep your wits about you on Las ramblas - do not take too much money with you at once and leave valuables in hotel - avoid any suspicious people who seem to be innocently asking you to help them look at a map, etc- all scams to distract you . If we return we will definitely book this hotel again- it is classy without pretentiousness and the staff are simply the best you could come across anywhere in the world . . . .", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel\u201d", "Author": "ZuzuTraveler", "ReviewID": "UR85879941", "Content": "This hotel is exactly what you'd expect.

Easyjet whizzed us from Bristol on a convenient lunch time flight....only an hour's delay!...would recommend the Aerobus from the airport to Place de la Catalunya. Make sure to get the return ticket, only 8.50 euros@. It's a really short walk from Place de la Catalunya to Hotel Montecarlo. The staff at the hotel are exceptional in their welcome and all-round service....they speak v. good English...will recommend restaurants, sight and attractions....couldn't do enough for their guests! The room was very comfortable - we liked the electronically controlled beds that will raise the pillows' area or bottom part of the bed. Although the hotel is right on La Ramblas it is an oasis of calm and peacefulness....has a good rooftop solarium open during the day. The location makes it ideal for exploring La Ramblas.....we each took belt wallets which we slung around our neck/arm bandolier style as we had heard the tales about Barcelona pickpockets - we had no problems, but there are lots of warning signs about pickpockets all over La Ramblas. First day, we took the open-topped HOHO Bus Turistic (get a discount voucher from the hotel) from Place de la Catalunya to aquaint ourselves with the tourist-sites layout ....as some of the sights are not easily accessible you might want to consider a 2-day pass, especially as there are 3 routes to travel on. We particularly enjoyed Parc Gruell....strolling along the port to the beaches....the cathedral....all the Gaudi architecture from the top of the bus....the Montjuic area - walk from hotel along Carrer Nou de la Rambla to the Parel-lel Metro stop ...go down to metro and get on the funicular ...at the other end get the cable car up to Montjuic castle....jaw-dropping views!! On the same trip, we visited the Olympic stadium and looked onto the Olympic swimming area as well. None of these places charge an entry fee (at the Cathedral the cloister is free...well worth a visit)....no time to visit the Jean Miro - next time we will! We went late one afternoon to the Picasso museum,,,,not too long a queue....very comprehensive collection of Picasso's early works -up to his blu&rose periods....look out for special expos - we saw Picass&Degas expo....fascinating! Eating places.....on the way back from the Picasso Museum we stopped at Evinia on Placa del Angel - good tapas selection..choose any 6 for 12 euros - try the rose cava to wash it down!....Cafe de L'Opera on the main La Ramblas was OK - lovely building - food nothing special....do try Escriba patisserie - just down from the hotel on the other side of the La Ramblas street ...deliciously tempting cakes,,and Barcelona hot chocolate is like no other - it really is liquid chocolate, puts the thin, machine-made muck we have at home to shame!!! Also, you must go to the wonderful mercat (market) on the Ramblas - La Bocqeria - an amazing market of vegetables, fish, meats (look for the hams!) and home to Pinotxo a small bar/eatery that is a Barcelona institution....presided over by Juanito Bayan ( you'll spot him as the old grey-haired guy in the waistcoat) and his sons, it is legendary in serving up an array of house speciality snacks and larger meals that vary day-to-day and even during the day....try the sugary 'doughnut'...Julia had scambled egg+clams...their cappucino is really good. We also ate one evening in a small restaurant Rincon de Aragon just off the Ramblas....very good oxtail and lamb cutlets, very drinkable Rioja - not touristy. We thoroughly enjoyed our (first time) stay in Barcelona....EasyJet was on time going back to Bristol - Yeh!.....we want to go back (still lots to see) and when we do, we will undoubtedly stay in Hotel Montecarlo!!!

There is a roof terrace for guests' use with many sun loungers and great views of the city a nice place to relax with drink. ROOM We stayed in a 4th floor room with balcony overlooking La Rambla. This was a superior room which was a nice size with a seperate sitting area. There was plenty of space for everything.with a wardrobe and shelves, safe, 2 TV's with about 5 english channels, a CD player, excellent Air Con, adjustable lighting and lamps, a minibar with reasonable prices and 2 phones. The decor of the room was basic minimalist, but spotlessly clean. There were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room. It was reallly nice to stand out on the balcony and watch the activities in the street below at every hour of the day and night. We also had fantastic views of Montjuic and the Eixample area from our balcony. The beds were craftmatic and fully adjustable to many different positions using a remote control. I found these the most comfortable beds ever and have never slept so well on holiday in my life - I wish I had one of these beds at home. We had no problems with noise from the street, as there were 2 sets of sliding doors for the balcony and once these were shut all noise was blocked out, excellent soundproofing. BATHROOM Plenty of towels and nice amenities replaced everyday. Hairdryer, bidet magnifying mirror and jet bath with salts. My only complaint is that we found the jacussi bath was not user friendly. You had to lean over the bath or climb into the bath to put on the water which was very difficult for my elderly companion. Also there was only a shower curtain which could not cope with the water pressure from the shower therefore the floor was completely flooded each time we used the shower. However the bathroom was cleaned well each day. BREAKFAST A buffet served in a pleasant breakfast room. Freshly squeezed orange juice and a pot of tea and coffee were brought to our table each morning. The buffet selection consisted of cerals, fruit, breads, cakes, eggs, bacon, sausages, cheese, cold meats etc. While not the most extensive selection ever it was all fresh and well presented and certainly enough to keep you going till lunchtime. The hot food selection could be improved upon. STAFF OK so this is really where the Montecarlo beats all other hotels IMO. All of the staff, without exception were so very genuine and pleasant. On arrival our luggage was immediately taken from us and carried up the entrance steps. We were welcomed and shown to our room even though it was only 11am. The reception staff greeted us at all times with a smile, they offered excellent advice on where to eat and the best way to get to certain places. The ladies in the breakfast room were very friendly and efficient, remembering each morning how we liked our coffee etc.!! Other Hotels should send their staff to be trained at the Montecarlo, because they certainly know how to treat their guests, and this makes for a most enjoyable stay.

From the outset and without exception the staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful. The location near the top of Las Ramblas, close to the Placa de Catalunya is about as central as it is possible to get. Our suite (104) was large (if oddly shaped) with an extremely comfortable king-sized, electrically adjustable bed, an effective aircon system, a little terrace (no outlook) and free wifi, there was also a little lounge area squashed into a corner with a sofa, TV and hifi and a little mezzanine 'library'! The bathroom was spacious and excellently equipped including a large spa bath - excellent for massaging aching feet at the end of a busy day. The hotel services brochure in the room was the most scant of any hotel I've ever stayed in, for example, it states that there is room service available, but no menu! We were on a B&B basis and found the breakfast buffet very limited in selection and had we been on a room only tariff would have breakfasted out. However it was adequate and service was excellent. There is also a roof terrace open from 10am to 7pm (I think) with seats and sun loungers offering excellent views of the city. Oddly we weren't told about it at check-in but we had read about on Trip Advisor before we went. For essential supplies there is a Carrefour Express directly across the street but we MUCH preferred to got to El Corte Ingles on Pl de Catalunya - far superior and a very good dept. store to boot. I'll save my review of the sights for a city review but a few things to watch - personally we hated Las Ramblas - too crowded and a bit grubby, but we appreciate people younger than us may love it. Pickpocketing is rife there and be careful about the pavement cafes, we sat down at one for a drink without noticing that there were no prices on the menu, and for 2 beers and one cake were charged 22 Euros and while nobody would go there twice of course, but there is a fresh supply of mugs like us every day. Also on the day we arrived we bought a bottle of water from a little shop on Las Rambles - 3 Euros. In El Corte Ingles - 30 cents. All in all a very, very good hotel.

Car parking is available at \u20ac25 per night, which sounds expensive until you look at prices for nearby parking which are from \u20ac33 to \u20ac45 per night. The only criticism I would raise is that the internet connection is poor. Wireless signal is fine but the Internet speed was consistently slow (25 mins to download a 50mb file) and secure VPN connections were not possible, probably due to unnecessary port blocking. Hotels (or their providers) need to recognise that allowing VPN connections INCREASES security for their guests.

Hotel Montecarlo made a fantastic base for us and is a really lovely hotel.,The front desk staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful, nothing ever seemed to be too much trouble. The rooms are spotlessly clean and modern - maid service twice a day, once in the morning and then again at night to 'turn the bed down'. Whilst there are no amenities as such (there is a sun terrace on the roof with sun loungers whch is very pleasant), who needs them when you're in Barcelona? The hotel is situated towards the top end of La Rambla (near Placa Catalunya). My cousin and I shared a twin room at the front of the hotel and were fortunate enough to have a small balcony overlooking the street. Surprisingly, we were not disturbed at all at night by any noise from the street (not that it was particularly noisy) and the wonderfully comfortable beds (remote controlled so you can raise the head end and/or feet end!!) ensured a good night's sleep. I would highly recommend the bus tours and DEFINATELY buy a two day pass - there's so much to see you will realise you need to take more than one tour. Despite there being so many of us in our party, there was 'something for everyone'. Plenty of shops, bars, cafes, fantastic architecture, museums, olympic village and a beautiful beach. A word of warning though, be very vigilant regarding bags, purses etc. and do not in any circumstances allow a gypsy woman to give you a red carnation and then request a small coin - one of our group had nearly 200 euros stolen this way whilst 2 of our group were looking on. How that gypsy woman took that money out of her purse under our noses is anybody's guess, but take it she did. Having said that, Barcelona is a fascinating place, I would definately go again (there's only so much you can see in 3 days) and without hesitation I would stay at Hotel Montecarlo.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cgreat place\u201d", "Author": "swcjlc1", "ReviewID": "UR68995311", "Content": "Stayed at the MonteCarlo one night after disembarking cruise ship.

The room was delightful, the bed extremely comfortable and the bathroom absolutely amazing with a rain shower with body jets as well as a separate whirlpool tub. And the morning breakfast was peaceful and delicious - a great way to start each day before heading out to the bustling La Rambla. Two things to be aware of: first, if you arrive on a day that La Rambla is closed to vehicular traffic, as we did on Sant Jordi Day April 25th, ask your taxi driver to let you out at the top of La Rambla so you can walk a short way downhill with your luggage. Unfortunately we were dropped 2 blocks over and about midway down La Rambla and had quite a hike uphill pulling and carrying our luggage through the crowds on La Rambla on that festive day. Second, be aware that in rooms facing La Rambla, dark metal blinds are lowered across the windows/doors at night, and these so effectively block out light and sound that we awoke mid morning and thought it was the middle of the night! It took us by surprise the first morning, but after learning where the controls were we realized how very necessary they were on a busy street like La Rambla.

On arrival in Barcelona we caught a taxi but do check the cost before hand though as we think we were conned slightly should only be about 30 euros. But you can also get a bus which drops you off at the top of Las Ramblas and is only 2 minute walk down to hotel which will be on your left hand side. On checkin we were too early but were able to drop off bags etc very professional staff who could not do enough to help us out. When we got back to hotel after we had got our bearings we were taken to our room 402 it was fab bathroom as big as front room at home had bath with jacuzzi and massive shower double basins toilet and bidet. The rooms were checked everytime we left and if needed wet towels immediately replaced and bins emptied. We also had sitting room and balcony which overlooked Las Ramblas fab! Um even though double windows first night seemed noisy but not unbearable just new setting noises! beds were divine. No drawers to put undies in but mini fridge and air con if needed. I would defo recommend bus rides there are three routes one to Port Olympic which is the business part of Barcelona and also where beach is second round takes in buildings such as Sagrada Familia and third to Camp Nou Stadium you can hop on and off to your hearts content and it's a great way to get your bearings as I naively did not realise how massive Barcelona is. If you get tickets from hotel you get discount and money off voucher book inside too every little helps! We went on cable car up to Castell de Montjic fantastic views of the city. Two fab restaurants to recommend The Gavina which was by Port Vell just by Museu d'Historia de Catalunya about 150 euros with wine but delicious and overlooking port the other one was the Dali which is on the road just behind The Montecarlo its like a mini castle and you can sit out on the roof and that was about 80 euros for two with jug of Sangria but both places we had lovely relaxing meal and were not rushed out of our seats. Breakfast at the Montecarlo is mediteranian we got ours in with the price of rooms but have read it was 15 euros each if I had had to pay would have gone elsewhere only coz I dont eat a great deal of breakfast and would have been expensive coffee! but my hubby had eggs bacon sausage etc which is all help yourself and kept fresh, there was also croissants, toast, cakes, fruit, yoghurts and cereals etc so you could really fill up and not need lunch. Staff were really helpful at all times. If you choose this hotel you can't go far wrong and if you do I hope you have as many happy memories as we have left with.

Our requests were met, and on arrival the efficient and courteous staff immediately engaged in conversation as if we were old friends. The standard of the 2nd floor rooms is very high. I cannot speak for the other floors as we didn't see them. The only reason for 'knocking off' a mark for rooms and sleep quality is that my room (203) only had a very small window looking into a narrow internal lightwell and as a result no natural light came into the room. Also it is located next door to a service area and the housekeeping staff start fairly early so I was woken a little sooner than I would have liked. My friends' room (202) however was a very spacious suite with a living area overlooking La Rambla and a vast bathroom/wetroom. It should be said however that I only paid for a single room, so in real terms I had no complaints at all. I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Barcelona.

Breakfast time was between 07:30 and 11:00 allowing real freedom to start early or to lie in. The breakfast menu was varried enough to suit all tastes and healthy options. If you are arriving at Barcelona's main airport, El Pratt, take the conecting bus into Placa de Catalunya which is only 10 mins away from the hotel and cheaper than a taxi. We arrived at Girona airport and the 75 min transfer via the Barcelona Bus (every 15 mins) cost 24 euros return. This bus takes you to the bus station, use the lift to take you to the taxi rank. If you are staying at Hotel Montecarlo it is situated on the lower part of La Rambla, although we had the directions to the hotel our taxi driver was confused over its location. The returning Girona airport bus is parked on the oposite side of the bus station. To see the city make use of the tourist buses. We used the Barcelona Bus Turistic which can be found in the Placa De Catalunya. The Hotel Montecarlo provide tickets for the bus at a discounted rate, i would advise you to have 2 days. If are going to see Sagrada Familia i would advise you go around lunch time. We went at this time after visiting Casa Batllo and LaPedrera. Along with Park Guell these are the main Gaudi attractions and are a must see for any visitor to Barcelona. Along the length of La Rambla you will see numerous live statues ,they range from the fantastic to the average but are great to see. If you are taking pictures they will expect a small tip. Towards the lower end of La Rambla there are artists and craft stalls and along each side of La Rambla there are tapas bars, restaurants and shops. We went to the Montiel Restaurant (www.restaurantmontiel.com) for an excellent romantic meal . It was on the expensive side but well worth it. We picked the taster menu which consisted of 7-8 small courses that gave an insight into the main menu. We visted Ciudad Condal 18-08007 on upper La Rambla for tapas.

I was there for three nights in May '10 for a brief break for myself and my wife. I had an executive room, which included a massive bathroom with jacuzzi, a small sitting room and a bedroom with a quirky electric bed (bit silly, I thought, but the room has been modified for disabled use, and I suspect this is part of that). The decor is stuck between refurbishments, so plenty of 80's beech combines with restored plasterwork and antique furniture. Small balcony looking out over La Ramblas (the weather was too bad to use this much, and the Montecarlo can hardly be held responsible for that). Effective blackout curtains and double glazing means the noise and light impact is minimised. The location is undeniably excellent, even if La Rambla palls after a day or two, but undermined by its position directly above the Metro line. This means wondering if you are being chased by a herd of bulls as you are roused from unconsciousness in the early hours (I was sure I was in Pamploma!). Must be worse further down, and I was on the third floor... The staff are genuinely friendly and helpful, recommended restaurants and potential places we might like to visit. The breakfasts were very good, but the general ambience of the hotel is fairly dead, with few public spaces and not much atmosphere. Some of the hotels across the street looked more exciting, with their own restaurants, thriving bars and better decor.

The man at the front desk said they would clean the room as soon as they could and we could get into the room between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. Perfect! We had a room on the front part of our hotel with a small balcony. I stood out on the balcony watching all the activity on Las Ramblas. However, when the double sets of glass doors were closed, you could not hear the noise outside. The room itself was very clean and contemporary. The bathroom was huge and looked like a spa. My husband said it was the best bathroom of any hotel that we have been in during our various trips throughout Europe. At night, I would sit in one of the chairs in the lobby overlooking the beautiful fountain outside and read the paper while my husband used the free computer access to follow the NCAA basketball scores.

Great view and you felt like you were in the street even from your room but close the windows which we did because it snowed(!) and the noise is largely gone. All in all a fabulous room which we used as our base for 4 nights. We asked for restaurant recommendations and all of them were just great whether for Tapas or a meal. The breakfast in the hotel isn't fantastic but OK however if you ask where to go for Churros you won't be disappointed by their recommendation or if you want the best breakfast go to the Pintoxa Bar in the market just a couple of minutes walk away. If I had one criticsm and it is only minor the hotel has a wonderful bar area which is hardly used and seems only to be open if you ask.

My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in this quality hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it. Booked direct with the hotel quite a while back and got a decent deal compared with the prices at the moment. The location is spot on, just a few minutes down the Ramblas from Playa Catalunya (easy direct bus from the airport for 5 euros each). Desk staff are very friendly, efficient and helpful (strangely all men, didn't see any female staff at all apart from the cleaners?). We had room 402, at the front overlooking the Ramblas with a small balcony - this was a superior room, absolutely huge, 3 separate rooms - bedroom, study and bathroom - the rooms as well documented are well equipped (2 TVs) although the furniture is a little on the 'cheap' side - very comfortable adjustable beds and amazing jacuzzi bath and power shower. As stated by some people the hotel does lack a bit of character and charm, it's not really a 'boutique' hotel but then again it's not trying to be, the bar is lacking in atmosphere admittedly but it's difficult to know how to improve that, maybe if it was at the front of the building overlooking the Ramblas it would get a bit more custom but that's not possible so there's not much the hotel can do I guess - we visited the rooftop which offered great views over this amazing city, not warm enough to sunbathe but I guess in the summer must be a nice place to relax - now this would be a great place to have a bar, we've enjoyed rooftop bars in hotels in Palma and Rome and they are a great attraction, perhaps this is something the Montecarlo could explore? Couple of other points - I'm a light sleeper but the air con worked well and was probably the quietest I've ever experienced and despite the hustle and bustle of the busy street below, can't say I heard a thing all night because of the high quality double glazing. So yes, would highly recommend the Montecarlo but take notice of the warnings of pickpockets in Barcelona, someone attempted to lift my wallet the first night on the Ramblas and there's a lot of shady characters about - perhaps further down towards the port - and we witnessed and heard of other unsavoury incidents, just have your wits about you. You will also get mugged in some of the bars - beware asking for a large beer - they served me up a 'stein' sized one - all 12 euros of it! And as much as I like tapas, it's easy to rack up a large bill as often they are not priced but are very tempting. It's still odd I think for us British ordering beers and food without having a clue of the cost, that's why we like paying for a drink straight away at the bar I guess, something the continentals just don't do. We didn't bother with the breakfast by the way, we just went for coffee and a pastrie in the nearby market, there's loads of other cafes around although if you're after a full English you will be disappointed.

The hotel is, like several others, on La Rambla - this is not the nicest part of Barca, though an important place to visit and central (like Oxford St in London or Champs Elysees in Paris) - lots of street artists, tourist stuff along the centre, shops nearby, McDonalds, Starbucks and tourist restaurants (fun area but watch you're belongings as rife with pickpockets - that goes for most tourist spots). Good secure car parking, friendly staff, decent breakfast at the Montecarlo. Nice clean room, pretty spacious, with beds that can be adjusted (as per hospital beds, not esp comfortable) ; clean bathroom but the whole ambience is of the room is like a good quality motel. There is a bar but it's like an extension of the lobby, and not somewhere one would want to sit for long. We preferred Hotel 1898 (tho quite a bit more more expensive than Montecarlo), Pulitzer for value and fab bar, Duquesa de la Cordona nearby, but most of all we liked the the MurMuri. Most places in the city that you'd want to go are in walking distance of all these hotels. I suppose we've reached an age where we'd rather (and can afford) to pay a bit more for quality.

I travelled with a friend and we were very pleased with the quality of the room - loved the adjustable beds which had extremely comfortable mattresses. I had asked at the time of booking if we could have a room overlooking La Ramblas and was told they would try but couldn't guarantee it. When we arrived we found we did have a lovely room with a round jacuzzi bath (glass door from bathroom into hall meant you had to close the hall door for privacy so not so good for the shy or casual companions!) and a balcony overlooking the famous street. It was lovely to be able to stand on the balcony and watch the world go by yet when we closed the (3!) double glazed doors we could hear no noise from the street at all. There was a great big floodlight on our balcony but that went off at 11 or 11.30 so that was ok! There was also no noise from other guests, partly I think due to the layout of the rooms and partly due to the type of guests the hotel attracts. We were told they do not take groups and that was a bonus for us or anyone who wants a peaceful hotel yet still in a fantastically central location. The hotel was full but we saw only a few other guests on the stairs and then again at breakfast. Breakfast is maybe a little expensive at 12 euros but you can eat as much as you want so on that basis it's not so bad. However, there are plenty of places to eat round about if you wanted to scout out a cheaper breakfast. The bar was a little lacking in atmosphere I agree. We came back one evening at about 11.15 and the bar was closed, for example, and when we had a pre-dinner drink one night (dinner out of the hotel as there is no restaurant) it was only us two in there. However that didn't really bother us as we two ladies were there to catch up with each other's news and weren't looking for the company of others. If you are looking for a hotel where you can mingle and chat with other guests then this hotel is probably not for you but I wouldn't agree that the whole hotel was soul-less. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and of course all spoke excellent English. Reception was always well-manned and the staff were very polite and discrete but always available if needed. Both of us said we would definitely return to this hotel if we ever go back to Barcelona. Ideal for small groups of friends, couples and very independent singles.

The comments from other contributors strongly influenced our decision to stay here. Unfortunately I don\u2019t feel we can be quite as glowing in our comments as many of the other contributors. Firstly, the plus points, many of which have been mentioned previously. The location is superb, right on La Rambla with its shops bars restaurants, markets and street entertainment just a step from the front door of the hotel. The hotel looks terrific externally and even better after dark when the outside is illuminated. It is immaculately clean and very well maintained and the staff are without a doubt courteous, friendly and knowledgeable and keen to help in whatever way they can with restaurant recommendations, maps to help you get around and get the most out of your visit. Needless to say they all spoke perfect English. The hotel is so easy to get to from Barcelona airport, don\u2019t waste money on a cab, especially if there are only two of you, the Aerobus from just outside the airport will get you to Placa Catalunya within 30 minutes and it\u2019s only a 5 minute walk to the hotel. Current cost is 5\u20ac each for a single. I believe you can get a discount for a return ticket but I don\u2019t know how much it is. We had a standard room which was modern and nicely furnished but with no views or balcony which was fine as we were not expecting these in a standard room. We had a small fridge and a 26 inch flat screen TV. Limited programmes in English but you don\u2019t come to Barcelona to watch TV!! A great feature was the electric bed, fully adjustable, head, feet, middle, you can adjust it any way you like, really comfy!! We also had a spa bath but didn\u2019t use it preferring to shower, and boy, was that powerful!! No tea or coffee making facilities so best to take a travel kettle, mugs, teabags etc. if you like a brew. Free internet access in reception is a welcome facility. There is a beautiful lounge on the 2nd floor overlooking La Rambla, you can people watch in tranquil comfort, very nice indeed! We ate breakfast in the hotel, this is 12\u20ac a head which was a bit of a shock as we hadn\u2019t realised that it wasn\u2019t included. Having said that however, there is an adequate choice of hot and cold items but they do need a plate warmer and the keeping hot facilities for the scrambled egg sausage and bacon were woefully inadequate. Unless you got to it within a couple of minutes of it being brought out it was luke warm to cold, a great shame and so easily rectified. Great coffee! The best we had anywhere during our stay. Now the downsides, an earlier contributor said that he felt the hotel had \u201cno soul\u201d and we know exactly what he meant. There is no restaurant, we never saw a soul in the bar and there are no public areas where you might bump into fellow guests and strike up a conversation etc. There is no buzz, little movement; pool, gym, in house enterrtainment ? No. This hotel is not so much a hotel as rented rooms with a reception and on that basis we considered it expensive at 160\u20ac a night. You are paying for the location which is great and is the sort of place I would stay in if I were spending a few days in Barcelona on business, it has that sort of feel to it. We would not return here due to this and the fact that 3 days for a Barcelona city break is quite sufficient. In summary, if you are looking for a room for a couple of nights, great but if you want a proper hotel feel, we don't think this will be for you.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sussex by the sea", "Title": "\u201cA fabulous place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Kataine", "ReviewID": "UR57556113", "Content": "We stayed for three nights in a deluxe room at this Hotel after having read the reviews and chose it as it has been so highky recommended.

We'd recommend leaving Barcelona on a Sunday rather than waiting for Monday which we did, sightsee by day, shop by night and dine with the locals at 10pm).", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWhisper quiet in the midst of the action\u201d", "Author": "travelhagPerth", "ReviewID": "UR47370020", "Content": "We really LOVED this hotel.

As well as the market, we would recommend the tourist bus - we used the Bus Touristic - but expect to wait around quite a bit, especially if you want to sit upstairs. We found it was busiest at Placa de Catalunya and it would have been better to get on at the stop before - if we'd bought a ticket beforehand. Given my time again, I'd have taken a 1-day trip around on the bus, then returned to the places we liked on the metro or taxi. We loved the Gaudi architecture - the rooftop of La Pedrera is worth queueing for. Parc Guell was great, although a bit too busy, but we found a small quiet area with picnic tables to have our ham, cheese and fruit from La Boqueria. No problems with pickpockets, but we were careful wtih our valuables and left most of our credit cards in the hotel safe.

As it was after midnight, there were all sorts of people milling about.We stopped for a moment to check our map for the street location of the hote, which is only one street from the Placa. A man walked up to ask for a light and as he distracted us, his parnter attempted to steal one of our bags. Luckily we caught sight in time. We then grabbed our bags and got to the hotel. What a wonderful haven in the middle of this place that is not so nice after midnight. We were greeted with such friendliness by the doorman that offered to take our bags. The front desk check in was efficient and helpful. Our room, which was a Deluxe room was very nice. When you walk in to the foyer you can go straight into a small sitting area with chairs, a TV, Minibar and Computer. To the left was a very spacious bedroom with an armoir, safebox, TV and clothes chest. The beds were fantastic. Connected but each with its own adjustments. You can raise and lower the head and foot of each separate bed. The linens were so lovely and you just sink into the bed. In addition, the bedroom had all the lighting options next to each night table, as well as a way to put the window darkening shades down. The bathroom, across the foyer was equally spacious, with a large walk in shower and vanity area. You then go further into an area with a large jacuzzi/ toilet area. The room was overall fabulous. We chose to have breakfast at the hotel and were very happy. The breakfast room is a nice space on the main floor. There were a variety of breads and pastries as well as bacon, eggs, hams, chorizos, cheeses, yougurts and fruits. They also offer fresh squeezed orange juice that was outstanding. The service was also top notch. It was a very satisfying way to start the day. During the day, the street out front has an entirely different atmoshrere. There are people with stall set up, there are people in costumes acting like statues, it is lively and very nice. We were only a few streets from the famous Marcado de San Jose. A very lovely semi covered food market with produce, meats, fish and a great deal more. There are also areas to eat at the counter or at small tables. The tapas and beer and wines were amazing.

You are 2 minutes walk from La Placa De La Catalunya where all the main shops start and all the buses drop off and pick up including the open top bus - 2 day pass is great value and a wonderful way to see the city ( by the way you must get off the bus at the stop after the olympic stadium at the cable cars and go to the top of the mountain to the castle - the views are breathtaking and so few people seemed to do it?) Turn left out of the hotel and walk down La Rambla straight to the harbour (about 4 mins) which is gorgeous - some lovely restaurants tucked round the back of there and you can sit right on the harbour. Barcelona was lovely and i can't recommend this hotel highly enough as a great base. Don't miss the food market set back on the left side of La Rambla - colours and foods that will amaze you!

Before traveling to Barcelona, we emailed the hotel asking if it would be possible to get into our room as soon as possible. They couldn't promise anything, but said they would do the best they could. After arriving from an all-night transatlantic flight from the United States and a train ride into the city, we were welcomed by the front desk team and told our room would be ready in 30 minutes. We were thrilled because we were able to take a 3 hour nap to recharge our systems! The service at this hotel is fabulous. They gave us maps and brochures of the city when we checked in , and answered any questions we had. Our room was facing the courtyard on the side, and it was very quiet due to the double-paned windows and the pull-down shade. The rooms have been refurbished and are clean, modern, and extremely comfortable. We slept soundly every night due to the comfortable adjustable beds. Just a tip - there were plenty of electrical outlets that we found to be a benefit to charge up our phones, camera, etc. We decided to stay at this hotel based on the location and the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Wow, what a great choice we made! The location couldn't be better - it is close to everything and directly on Las Ramblas. Placa de Catalunya is a short walk and from there you can access the tourist bus, subway, and commuter train to the airport. The La Boqueria market, the waterfront area, and the Gothic Quarter are all a short walk away. There are plenty of cafes, shops, and restaurants in all of these areas. Here are a few tips on what to see/do/eat: 1. Be sure to go to the La Boqueria market - it is a wonderful site to see as well as buy fruit and snacks. We particularly liked the fresh fruit smoothies. Be sure to walk farther in the market for the better prices on smoothies and food. The stands at the front charge the most. 2. Go to the waterfront area - there are tons of places to eat, shop, rest, and people watch. The view of the Mediterranean is gorgeous as you sip on a sangria! 3. To see the sites around town, be sure to get on the Barcelona Bus Turistic. We found it online on www.barcelonaturisme.com and it is wonderful! There are 3 different routes you can take, and you can get on/off the bus as you like. You can buy a 1 or 2 day pass - it is definitely worth every cent. The buses are double decker with the top deck being open-air. Try to get on the top deck if possible for the best views. You will receive ear phones to plug in at your seat and select the language of your choice. Everything is narrated, informative, and interesting They give you coupon books with each ticket, and the discounts almost pay for the cost of the tour ticket. There are discounts for all of the popular sites, and we used a lot of them. You can buy tickets for the tour bus at Placa de Catalunya. 4. There are plenty of places to eat, but we enjoyed Tapa Tapa which is on Passeig de Gracia which is a short walk north from Placa de Catalunya. It is across the street from Gaudi's Casa Batllo (a must see!). We also enjoyed Ciutat Condal which is 1 block north from Placa de Catalunya. Another tapas restaurant which we enjoyed was Txapela which is a basque-style pintxo bar on Passeig de Gracia. Each of these places provides menus in English as well as in other languages. 5. The hotel offers breakfast, but we never ate there. We were usually up and out early and got something to eat along the way. 6. There is a computer in the lobby area with free internet connection for the hotel guests. If you have your laptop, they will provide you with a card that gives you free wi-fi access. We would absolutely stay here again in the future.

No need to ask for extra pillows for once. After our cruise we stayed again on the 6th June. This time in a superior room. We requested a balcony overlooking La Rambla and were lucky enough to get it. I couldn't understand the comment that one reviewer made that it was noisy. There are two sets of doors and once they are closed there is absolutely no outside noise. The superior room had a large round jucuzzi and the same 6' wide very comfortable beds as the standard. The room is just larger and a little more luxurious. As there is no evening dining we went to The Attic Restaurant a few doors away. The decor and food are excellent and not too expensive. We had the veal fillets and they were delicious. (Look at the photos of each meal at the top of the menu if you can't choose). The house rose wine was reasonably priced and very nice. I recommend booking a table at weekends as it gets busy. Pl. Catalunya has all the city bus tours and El Cortez Ingles department store and at the lower end of La Ramblas across from the Colombus statue is a bridge leading to Mare Magnum shopping centre with some nice cafes. Other places of interest as well as the Cathedral and Football Stadium are Pl Espanya, The Fountains of Monjuic and Tibidabo. if you don't want to take a tour the Red and Green line Metro will take you to most of the sites and a T10 (zone 1) ticket will cost 7.70 euros.

We picked the Monte Carlo based purely on the strength of the TA reviews and were not disappointed. The location was excellent, only 3 minutes walk from Place de la Catalunya and the airport bus and overlooking the main strip of La Rambla. The rooms were fine, modern, nice bedding and enough storage. But the main point that will stick in our memories was the super friendly and helpful front desk staff. From the moment we arrived they explained the local attractions and bus routes, recommended restaurants, bars and clubs and then showed us up the room. Their English is excellent and all of this was done in a non-pushy way and they did not seem to be openly expecting tips in return. We had access to our room early, from 12:00, and then on the day we checked out left our bags all day and used their bathroom facilities to get changed ahead of the return to the cold english weather. Our room overlooked La Rambla but due to the 2 layers of double glazing there was no noise, despite this being the day that Barcelona retained the league football championship and there being a massive celebration in the street below. The other major selling point was the huge jacuzzi bath which really helped us both 'relax'.

We had room, I believe 204, which overlooks Las Rambla, with a small veranda and separate sitting room. The shades are electric and there is no street noise. The staff is exceptional and graciously met with all of our inquiries - ask them for directions to Ciutat Condal for tapas, great and fun place to eat. We also had the Jr. Suite with a steam shower, and library, but for view, I prefer the room overlooking Las Rambla. You can have bkfst in your room or the dining room.

The room was lovely and absolutely spotless. We had a balcony which looked onto the ramblas and the glass was soundproof so we didnt get any noise at all despite being on the busiest street in Barcelona! The bed's were brilliant and the jacuzzi had plenty room for two people. The minibar wasnt too expensive and the safe was free of charge to use. The only fault I could possibly make was that we were charged 5 euro to use an iron which was located inside a room containing a shower etc also. 5 euro allowed you 1 hours use of the room. It rained quite heavily on one of our days so the staff provided us with umbrella's to take out with us and when we realised we'd came without a travel adaptor, the staff were on hand to provide us with one free of charge!

Despite that it's noisy as hell in that area, the hotel in general and my room in particular were silent. The staff were friendly and helpful. I will say that, while I asked them to advise me on a restaurants, I didn't eat at any of the ones they recommended. They pointed me to 3 specific restaurants in the area, which guide books advised were overpriced and generally lacking in service as they catered to tourists. I just felt like they might be getting kickbacks from those places and since they had free internet, I just went to Trip Advisor and looked up my own restaurants. As usual Trip Advisor was dead on. So I can't tell you if their recommended restaurants were good or not. I can only tell you that TA's were great! No complaints at all about this hotel, overall. Clean, great location (although I cannot emphasize enough--beware of pickpockets on the Rambla), friendly helpful staff. Didn't try the breakfast (about 10-12 euros)...stuck with coffee and croissant at any of a number of cafes in the immediate area. One last point: we arrived on April 23 which is the feast day of St. George, the patron saint of Barcelona. Didn't seem like a problem beforehand, but I came to find that the Rambla is closed to traffic that day and the place is flooded with people celebrating the day.

Breakfast was pretty good with meats / fruit / cereal / pastries / bread or toast with preserves / fresh coffee (they really can't make a cup of tea) and fresh orange & the dining area was spacious. The Pound was very poor against the Euro at almost 1:1 and at 12 Euros therefore, breakfast was a little pricey for what it was (but that's not a complaint for I knew the price & chose to have it). The only thing lacking was a pool & no tea / coffee making or kettle in the room (you could have coffee via room service til 11pm) but there is a Starbuck's coffee place across the Road).

Just walk back a short way and Las Ramblas is the centrally paved road with droves of people walking along. The hotel is only a one or 2 minute walk along from Catalunia and is on the left hand side.

The beds were great for resting after a long day because they could be raised to a seating position or to drain your legs. The staff were incredibly polite and friendly. Quique in particular gave us excellent restaurant recommendations and was very welcoming with a wicked sense of humour. The hotel is perfectly located on the Ramblas (we could people watch from our balcony), close to the Plaza de Catalunya and great for nightlife in the Barri Gotic. Barcelona is culture, culture, culture bursting with museums and incredible gothic, modernista and contemporary architecture. Don't miss the MNAC (museum of Catalunyian art) and its wonderful restaurant with a view called Oleum. The hop-on buses are an excellent way to get to all the top cultural sites. It is worth booking a ticket for two days rather than one. Thank you to all the past reviewers of this hotel for pointing us in the direction of the best hotel possible!

For example, one day we got caught in some rain showers without an umbrella while sightseeing and arrived back at the hotel a little wet from the rain.

However, upon our arrival at about 10:00 am, presumably knowing we were arriving early, they informed us that they had our room ready. Impressive service! We got an updated room which was a little plain (art-deco-ish style) compared with many hotels we've stayed at, but very tastefully done. The bathroom was excellent, which is something that you don't always see in Europe. We had no problem with the dual beds making up the king-size bed that other reviewers have mentioned. The staff were great, explaining the various features of the room like the electric blinds, air conditioning and beds and they handed us some useful tourist books without our even asking. The room was clean, quiet and well maintained. What more could you ask for? We had the 11 Euro breakfast one morning, which was ok but about the only thing I would not rate as \"exceptional\". This was our first visit to Barcelona and I was amazed at how good a location this hotel has. Besides being on La Ramblas, it is also near Placa Catalunya which is a transportation hub, if not the hub of the city. The Metro, buses, airport bus and city tour buses are just a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. When we sadly left, we took the airport bus from there which only costs 4 Euros and 5 cents each.

As one of of the previous reviewers commented, King sized bed is actually made of two single beds, which obviously is not ideal. 2. This is probabaly only summer time but just in case some travellers may not like it - The hotel shares its courtyard area with the next door hotel which has a open air restaurant/cafe there. From about 21:00, they have open air cinema, which is quite loud and if your room faces this side (which itself is a good thing as it is quieter than facing La Rambla) you will hear it even with your window closed. It finishes around 23:00 so, if you are out for dinner for these hours, it should not cause you a headache.

Wanting to focus on my wife and on our first visit to Barcelona, I was only too happy to leave the details of the 8 restaurant reservations and the excellent daily breakfasts up to the hotel staff. We are also movie buffs, and that need was met by the staff's recommendations and followup with reservations and directions to two English-language showings. The hotel management's attention to detail cannot be overstated. The staff's fluent command of English, both written and verbal, eased our exchanges of e-mail as well as our understanding of the available opportunities for enjoying Barcelona. After several visits to other parts of Spain, we were impressed by the staff's unfailing good humor and by their obvious intelligence. While I had selected most of the restaurants in advance (which were made by hotel staff) from an excellent guidebook (Mary-Ann Gallagher's \"Barcelona Handbook\"), the best one of all came as a result of a hotel staffer's recommendation, the Quo Vadis. Located just off La Rambla a few hundred meters from the hotel, the Quo Vadis is an elegant, intimate spot for those whom appreciate quality, attentive service and selection. The evening that we chose to eat there was the only one in which it rained, so we were grateful for its proximity to the hotel. Other restaurants we liked were Attic, Can Culleretes (excellent Easter Sunday goose), Elche, L'Oliv\u00e9, and El Gran Cafe (better for lunch than dinner, lights too bright). Elche and L'Oliv\u00e9 are very good, midpriced seafood/Catalan restaurants catering to local clientele. The Attic is conveniently located a few doors down on La Rambla and was a pleasant surprise, in terms of price and quality, after our late arrival from Copenhagen. The hotel's location is a distinct plus. Some photos are attached of views from the balcony, including those of the Good Friday procession. With the double-insulated doors closed, we could not hear any noise from La Rambla's unceasing activity. After a full day of museum visits, sightseeing and shopping, it was a pleasure to come back to the room's jacuzzi and soak our weary bones, accompanied by cold cava from the minibar. If you stay 3-5 days, and plan to use the Metro to visit several museums & attractions, consider buying the Barcelona Card at the airport, or at Placa Catalunya. Also, try to use the Liceu station just down La Rambla, instead of the vast Catalunya metro station whenever you can.

The porter took our bags to reception where we were swiftly and efficiently checked in by a polite and helpfull receptionist with perfect English. After checking in, the porter went with us to the room, carrying the bags and then showing us the features etc. of the room. The room was great - a good sized room with king size bed, contemporary style and nice and clean. The room had doors which opened to overlook La Rambla - and even though the street outside was busy and bustling, you could close the doors and all was quiet. In fact, the hotel was quiet as a whole - everyday we had a nice long lie in without being woken up by noise. The bathroom was wonderful - a good size, clean and with a nice big jacuzzi - big enough for two :-)) with a good shower over the bath.

Overall this was an excellent hotel that I would definitely recommend. TIP - the tax from the airport to the hotel was about 40 Euros inc. tip.

However, once I made it to the reception desk, everything was great. I arrived around 10 in the morning, which was of course earlier than usual for check-in. I was initially told that my room was not yet ready, but a staff member nearby (presumably someone more senior) said to hang on, and then when he finished helping the guest he was with he found me a room that was ready so that I could check in - which was much appreciated after the long flight from the US. A staff member showed me my room and then delivered my luggage for me. The room was lovely, spacious and quiet. I didn't have much of a view, but it didn't really matter to me since I didn't plan on spending much time hanging around in the room. The marble bathroom was especially pretty. I did have a brief problem with the electrical outlet in the bathroom not working, but that was quickly resolved when someone came up to the room and flipped the breaker. The room had everything I needed including a minibar, blow dryer, safe, etc. Prices for drinks from the minibar seemed quite reasonable. The bed was very comfortable - and could even be adjusted so I could sit in an upright position while reading or watching TV. I truly loved the location of this hotel, being able to walk out the door and be on a busy area of Las Ramblas. There are many restaurants, shops, etc. nearby, and it was enjoyable just to walk up and down the streets. You can catch either of the major tourist buses with about a five-minute walk to Placa de Catalunya. There is also a metro station a couple of minutes away. Upon checkout I needed a taxi, and the staff was gracious in telling me just to wait inside while they hailed a taxi for me and got my luggage down the steps to the taxi. Not being very proficient in Spanish or Catalan, I had written down my destination (I was going to the port to catch a cruise) and the hotel staff member was kind enough to relay it to the driver, who spoke no English. In fact, the cab driver I had coming in from the airport did not seem to speak any English either - while most of the hotel staff seemed to have perfect English. This was another plus for me.

We did not opt to pay 9 euros for the breakfast, but instead ate breakfast at the cafe literally next door, Moka Cafe, for a cheaper price. There was a cash machine next door, too, and of course the location on La Rambla couldn't be beat. The hotel is rated 3 stars, which I find puzzling, since it seems at least a 4 star hotel to me.

This was our first trip to Barcelona and we wanted a location that was central to the touristic sites. When we first walked down La Rambla to the hotel, we were apprehensive because La Rambla was SO packed with people and full of activity - we were worried that it would go on all night and that our room would be noisy. We asked for a quiet room and got 206, which turned out to be in the new part of the hotel on a private courtyard (private to other buildings). Even though we kept the window the the courtyard open every night, we slept in complete silence and tranquility. That was the first thing we loved about the hotel: being in the middle of everything and having it be quiet at night. Besides that: the hotel is stunning. It is a beautiful old (Beaux Arts?) building that has been updated with modern design giving it the best of both worlds. We did not see rooms in the old part, but ours, in the new part was simple and lovely. It had a platform bed, a built-in desk with a free internet line, an ample closet, a chair and small table, and a spacious bathroom. In fact, the bathroom was really gorgeous, with chocolate brown slate tiles, a jacuzzi tub, and modern fixtures. The pictures on the website do not do this hotel justice. It is much prettier! On the mezzanine is a beautiful old sitting room with a magnificent fireplace and lots of sitting areas. It has chairs where you can sit and watch all of the activity on the street. The people working at the hotel were extremely helpful and courteous. The hotel is just two blocks from the Plaza Catalunya, which is where the fabulous touristic buses board and where the airport bus stops. Thus, you can get to the hotel from the airport for only 4 Euros (30 minute trip).

You need to read this if you are thinking of staying at this hotel. Ok, we stayed at this hotel for part of our honeymoon in Barcelona. Location is good and rooms are ok but nothing great for the money. Our last night there after we just went to sleep around 3 AM we hear shouting in the hallway. Then there is this load banging on our door from a girl screaming in some foreign language. Of course we didnt know what to do so we just waited and we heard banging on the door next to us. This goes on for like 5 minutes and I didnt want to open the door because I dont know who is out there and what their issue is, so I call the front desk. Front desk tells me that some crazy lady got on the elevator before they could stop her and they are aware she is in the hotel. I tell the guy well shes is banging as hard as she can on my door and the rooms next to me on the third floor so please have her removed. He says ok and that he also called the police. This baging goes on literally for the next 45 minutes. This lady is crying, screaming, and banging on our door and the rooms next to us so loud that I honestly felt she was going to break the door down. I called the front desk again, same guys there and no action is taken. Finally around 4:14 AM the banging stops and we try to go back to sleep but with all that happening and it being so loud and odd I probably got 1 hour of sleep before I had to wake up and get my plane. So the next morning I go to check out while my wife finishes gathering things in the room. I ask to talk to the owner. A middle aged man downstairs said he is the owner. He spoke some English and I explained to him in English and Spanish about what happened. He said he was aware of it and it was a lady and a husband or boyfriend that have stayed there before that were in a fight, which was very different then the story I heard the night earlier about some random crazy walking in off the street. I explained it was our heoneymoon and we paid a lot for the hotel and I didnt think we should need to pay for the last night becuase of what happened. You dont pay $300/night to stay at a hotel and have that kind of experience. I own 3 different businesses in the US and any other business owner would agree that some sort of action should be taken by the owner of this hotel for his guests. Well this guy flipped out. Came around the desk and started yelling and screaming with his fist in the air that we better pay for all the nights. This guy was crazy. So to wrap this up, he actually grabbed me by the shirt at least three times and tried to shove me, kicked our bags and our $1500 worth or artwork we purchased in Barcelona the day before that was wrapped in a bix that said fragile, tried to have a bell boy take our bags, and just acted like a real ass. I told him we would have the cops come and they could see the videotape of what just happened. he had one of his workers go in the back room and do something (Im pretty sure get rid of the tape). The police came which were little help. I told them to watch the tape. They came back 5 minutes later and told me it was out of order. I filed a police report there becuase they advised me it would take too long to go to the police station. We ended upo missing our flight anyways and now I am disputing the charge for the hotel on my credit card because of all this. What a way to treat your guests after they are put through a night of screaming and yelling by other guests outside of your room. Especially when you know how much they are paying a nigh to stay there and that it is your honeymoon. Stay away from this place. Only thing good about it is the location. Services suck. Cant even get ice unless the bar is open and then you need to walk downstairs and have them go get you some. Not worth it. Trust me. Rest of hte trip was great.

I thought it was one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in, and the price was excellent for Barcelona, the quality of the place, and the location. Now I'm not so sure anymore. I was on the third floor, and the renovations on the second were infernally noisy. Yes, they said they'd stop if it bothered me but surely they wouldn't suspend everything for the 5 days I stayed here. Not a big deal if you're out during the day (the work goes from 9 to 6) but if you're planning to spend quality time inside, not pleasant. Last time we had a room with a view of the Ramblas, which was great and quiet. This time, I had a room with no view whatsoever, only looking across a narrow space at another room, and as an earlier reviewer said, there's very little natural light because the top is covered. This made the room very dark and depressing. I would certainly not want to stay in this kind of room again. It may be that this is only the case for single rooms though, so if you're travelling with a companion, it may not be a problem. The third issue is the one that bothered me the most, and probably means that I will never stay here again. When I wanted to bring a friend, who was staying at another hotel, up to my room so he could check his email, the reception desk staff told me I was not allowed to have visitors. He said the little slip you sign at check-in said so on the back. I went up and checked (with my friend waiting downstairs), and indeed, it said that for security, no visitors were allowed. Many hotels have a similar policy, except it's usually something along the lines of \"visitors must be accompanied by guests at all times\". I find it completely unacceptable that a hotel would forbid its guests to have visitors, not to mention very embarrassing for the guest who has to make his visitor wait downstairs. But again, whether this is a problem, depends: if you're not going to have visitors, you won't be bothered by this unfriendly policy. Of course, the hotel still has many positive features. The rooms are nice, the breakfast is actually good value at 9 Euros, and most of the people at the reception desk are very friendly and helpful. So altogether, Hotel Montecarlo is a mixed bag and I can certainly no longer recommend it without reservations.", "Date": "June 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cprofessional staff, quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "atty_busnss_travlr", "ReviewID": "UR7780244", "Content": "We spent 4 nights here in late May, third floor front room on the Ramblas. At the time of the stay the third floor had already been renovated, the second was in the midst of renovation, and then they will renovate the 4th and 5th floors. The first floor has a large conference or public room but no guest rooms. I note that the previous reviewer was required to sign a form stating that he understood renovation was ongoing. On the other hand, we were told that if the work bothered us they would immediately stop all work on the room below us. We were always out of the hotel during the day, so it wasn't a problem, but since renovation is likely to be ongoing for months, I recommend people try to stay on renovated floors away from the ongoing work. I did not see inside any rooms on non-renovated floors, but I walked down the hall way on the fifth floor to reach the solarium, and the carpet was very warn. If this is an example of what the rooms themselves look like on the non-renovated floors, I would again recommend keeping with the renovated rooms. We were a little nervous about possible noise in a room directly above the Ramblas, so asked to see a variety of rooms. I have never in my life had hotel staff so willing to show us so many rooms, all on the 3rd floor. I would say the footprint of the rooms were all about the same square footage, large for a European 4 star hotel, and very large for Barcelona. The main difference is the size of the Jacuzzi, and thus the bathroom. The room we ended up accepting, on the Ramblas (and with double doors, each double paned, noise from the Ramblas is a non-issue), had a vast Jacuzzi, and thus probably a third of the room consisted of the bathroom. Another room we were shown had a bathtub that was so small I couldn't possibly see how to get in, or more importantly, out of it. As a result the bathroom was small and the bedroom thus much larger than the bedroom portion of our room. Why in such a huge room would you have a half-bath tub? Weird. And weird also was our swimming pool of a Jacuzzi. It took an immense amount of water to half-fill the thing, and there was a long, and I mean long, set of instructions explaining how to work the thing. Despite both of us reading the instructions out loud to the other, we couldn't get it to work, and when someone arrived to explain it they couldn't get it to work either. Not a problem, but a tad odd. Also odd was the selection of furnishings which ranged from typical 4 star hotel nice wood head board and side board to a lamp that even Ikea would have found cheap which you turned on by yanking the electrical cord! But these are nits. The temperature controls, window coverings and lighting allowed one complete control over the environment, and housekeeping did a very professional job throughout our stay. The room included a table with nice chairs, plenty of reading lights and even a pocket door that you could close in the hallway between the bathroom and bedroom where you could read without disturbing someone sleeping. There is one computer with not very good free internet access in the lobby and a fair selection of international papers. The common seating area is comfortable though rather corporate. I found the solarium rather odd, since it is just an unfinished portion of the roof with an outdoor shower, and the hours are oddly short, 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM. But the area where this hotel really stood out was the professionalism of the staff. Our demands were limited to seeing endless room at check in, having our boarding passes printed the night before we left, borrowing umbrellas, getting wine bottles opened and chilled and receiving explanations of how to reach a couple of destinations. They handled all of these requests very well, and each time we returned to the hotel they remembered our room number. But what really impressed me was the unbelievable range of requests guests threw at them during our stay. A problem back at the office continued to plague my trip, so I spent way too long at that one computer off the lobby. One simply awful young woman demanded that staff find her a rental car to get to her next destination, some resort a couple of hours away. Loudly announcing in her US english that money was not a concern, merely that they find an agency to deliver the car to her and that would allow her to drop the car at the resort. Cheerfully the front desk wrote down this request and began making calls. Hours later when I again sat myself in front of the computer and the woman returned from her day shopping in Barcelona (huge number of expensive bags in tow) and asked about the arrangements, they were able to assure her that the car would arrive the next morning at the requested time, she merely needed to provide her credit card for the reservation. Upon hearing the price ($275 for a 2 or 3 day car rental) she told them to cancel it, it was way above her budget, and instead get her train reservations. I would have hit her (which is one reason why I'm a lawyer and not in the hospitality industry), but they were as pleasant and professional as could be. Another woman was in tears as I sat at the terminal while the desk explained that they had no reservation under her name and the hotel was full for the night. She then admitted that she had never actually received a confirmation from the hotel, but that since she had sent an email and they hadn't actually said no, she assumed... They couldn't have been nicer. They asked her 20 questions about exactly what she wanted in a hotel, what price she was willing to pay & then called and found her a room. They then called her a cab! It got so that every time I returned to the hotel room from my awful battles at the computer trying to solve the office problems I would have at least one story of the incredible people at the front desk. If only they could have solved my office problems with the same smile & attention to detail they afforded each and every request that came past the front desk!", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "RodW", "ReviewID": "UR7722331", "Content": "We stayed at the MonteCarlo Hotel for two nights May 2 & 3.

It is a nice hotel, but you are paying for that (135 euro per night for a single room), so as such I had a few complaints: 1) My room had windows on 2 sides, but they were both facing small inner courtyards about 3 feet by 10 feet. At first I was only mildly disappointed because I figured at least I would get some light and it should be quiet. It was quiet, but there was no light because the tops of these courtyards were covered up with a shade. It seems like all the reviews I read mentioned the great view overlooking Las Ramblas - just wanted people to be aware that no view/light is a possibility. I wasn't expecting a Ramblas view but at least thought I might get a room facing the back that got some light. It made it really hard for me to adjust to the time zone change without the morning light as a cue. So, I ended up staying up really late and sleeping late (hated to use an alarm clock on vacation!), which lead to my next problem. 2) They informed me at check-in that they were doing some \"minor\" renovations and had me sign a disclaimer stating that I was aware of that after telling me that it was just a formality and that I wouldn't notice anything because it was really very minor. The renovations were hardly \"minor\" but I guess they were hoping that most guests would be out the door bright and early. Around 9 to 10 am the work started, and there was no way to possibly sleep through it. I could see some of the work on the 2nd floor below me out my window and it was totally gutted. I really would have appreciated being informed of this in advance. When I booked a hotel for Italy this fall, they actually had a renovation special advertised for a few months this year. I thought that would have been a better way for Montecarlo to handle it. Having said that, if you are the type to be out the door early, then it wouldn't have been an issue. This was also the same woman who told me I probably wouldn't want to go see the Font Magica at Montjuic because it isn't very popular anymore anyway, plus there are many pickpockets. This, of course, didn't make sense to me, as popularity and pickpockets are generally directly proportional, so I went. It was great (and very popular), and I didn't have any pickpocket trouble. Even took the metro by myself late at night. I think she meant well - she was probably concerned about my safety, but I still thought it was bad advice. I really liked the rooftop \"solarium\" - especially since the view from my room consisted of walls- but was totally disappointed that it was only open until 7pm. Would have been a perfect place to relax with a glass of wine in the evening. What a shame. So here are the good things: The location towards the top of Las Rambles is ideal. Just a few minute walk from Plaza Catalunya, so the Aerobus is a great transportation option from the airport, and the metro station is practically right out the door. Room was large, bed more comfortable than most but firm, loved the robe and slippers. Jacuzzi tub was really nice after a long day of sightseeing. TV/sound system had a speaker in the bathroom. Thermostat in room, so you could adjust to whatever temp you wanted. Plenty of toiletries in bathroom, hairdryer was powerful. Free internet access in lobby was a nice touch, but the one computer they had was pretty popular during the day and evening, so there was often a wait (and people waiting for you to be done), so only useful for long emails if you got on it late at night. I had the 9 Euro breakfast only one day, but it might have been worth it just for the fresh-squeezed orange juice. Plenty of variety, food was good. The other days I either started with lunch or bought some fruit and/or a pastry at the Boqueria market. So, it is a nice hotel. Next time I would ask some specific questions regarding the room and condition of the hotel at the time before booking, though. In all, an average experience for what I paid.

It's a fantastic retreat from the noise and crowds of the street. One minor negative: on checking-in we were advised of building work taking place on the second floor (Pre-season stuff, only in the afternoons) and we were told that should there be any disturbance to call reception and they would move the builders onto another part of the building. Needless to say we were initially very sceptical and assumed the worse, however we didn't get disturbed whatsoever during our stay.

I was sceptical before arriving about the hotel's claim that the rooms were virtually soundproof - being that the hotel is situated on the busiest thoroughfare in Barcelona, but this is certainly the case. I would recommend that even if your room is not on the top floor you should take the lift to the 5th floor and walk up the short flight of stairs to the roof terrace - the views in all directions are stunning. I'm going back to the hotel next year with a larger group of friends, and although you can find cheaper accommodation in the city I feel its certainly worth the extra to stay at the Montecarlo. If you only have a short time to spend in City, I would thoroughly recommend you visit the Sagrada Familia - it's quite simply breathtaking.

From the time of our arrival until the end of our 3 night stay ( 06/14-06/17) in Barcelona could not find anything negative to say about the place. Fantanstic location near the top of La Rambla, near plaza Cataluniya (sorry for the spelling), probably the best location possible, for us. Great room with a little balcony facing La Rambla, more like a suite, really, with a foyer, small living area and a huge bathroom w/ jacuzzi. 4 sets of dual glazed aluminum sliding doors blocking all the noise, not 2 as many reviews stated. In-room safe, minibar, sweet wine and chocolates on our arrival. The room was basic but charming. Everything we needed steps away, including Starbucks. Barcelona is a gorgeous and safe city. Charm and atmosphere at least on par with places like Rome. No purse snatching or pickpocket incidents to report. Great restaurants which are reasonably priced. In smaller shops on La Rambla (basically a tourist center) always ask about the price before you buy, or chances are you will be overcharged. Agree on the price with taxi drivers before you get in. Our cab driver decided to overcharge us 10 euros on a way back to the airport. There were 4 euros on the meter when we got in, plus he wanted 7 euros surcharge for our 3 bags. About 10 euros more than what we paid on the way to the hotel. And no matter what, STAY AWAY from money exchange booths on La Rambla, especially the two which are located to the right of the hotel, on the same side of the street, on the way to Plaza Catalunya. The posted exchange rate in columns 1 and 2, already a little high, is misleading, since it only refers to sums of 6,000 euros or larger. Exchange rate for smaller sums is typically in small hard to see letters which refer to columns (typically 3, 4, or 5) with higher rates. In one of the places I mentioned the lady wanted to charge me 18% commission which she immediately agreed to reduce to 5%. I would not pay 5% and moved on to the one next door, a little closer to the hotel. In that exchange booth I pointed to the column which indicated $1.33 per euro and asked if that is the rate and if it included the commission. The lady at the counter said \"yes\". The official exchange rate that day was $ 1.259 per 1 euro. But when I handed her $ 300 she exchanged it at $1.42 per 1 euro. After my immediate protests, she refused to return my $300 (she probably already spent $ 30 she ripped off from me in her mind), pointing to the column which indicated $ 1.58 per 1 euro, saying she gave me $1.42 rate instead of $ 1.58 as a favor. Small writing behind her (you couldn't even see it when she was sitting down) indicated that column to apply for exchanges under 6,000 euros. I decided not to get ripped off on principle and was able to get my money back with the help of 2 policemen which were passing by. The only reason I got my money back was that $ 1.42 per 1 euro rate did not appear in any column. The best rate I could get in Barcelona was $ 1.33 per 1 euro, including commission, from a bank. My worst experiences in exchanging currency were in Spain, particularly in Barcelona.

I speak Spanish fluently, but most of the staff spoke excellent English. Though we arrived late in the evening, they held a beautiful room with a balcony for us, which we soon thought would be a terrible mistake. Knowing nothing of football, we hadn\u2019t realized that we arrived on the night of the European Cup \u2013 promising riotous crowds whether Barcelona won or lost. Once Barcelona did win, La Rambla went absolutely crazy. We watched, amused, from the balcony as 100,000+ fans streamed on the streets below, complete with fireworks, air horns, and drums. We feared a sleepless night, but the second we closed both of the sliding glass doors, the room was silent. The only noise heard was the firework finale, and even that was quite muted. For me, peace and quiet is paramount in a hotel, and I think the Montecarlo passed the ultimate test that night! As a nod towards the city of Barcelona, they seem quiet apt at handling crowd control, and the streets were spotless the next day! The room itself was exceptional, particularly by European standards. It was large and the beds quite comfortable. The bathroom was amazing, with plenty of space and a whirlpool tub which feet incredible on sore walking feet. As already mentioned, the staff was good, as was the restaurant \u2018Attic\u2019 (next door) that they recommended. The location could not be better, right in the middle of La Rambla. Both younger women, we never felt apprehensive walking around the area late at night, which was safe and always full of people. Though we didn\u2019t have any problems with pickpocketers, a couple we met at dinner had their wallets stolen in the metro station. As long as you are alert and aware of your belongings, however, don\u2019t let all of the warnings worry you. The hotel is admittedly expensive \u2013 the most of the seven we stayed in throughout Spain. There are plenty of other hotels on La Rambla, and many of them looked nice as well, so do your homework.

The room was clean (but see other comments later), the towels and robes very comfortable and the jacuzzi bath good fun. The adjustable bed was very good for elevating the feet after a long walking day. The hotel's position halfway along La Rambla is perfect. Now the disappointments - The room (403) was very small with no dressing table nor mirror, except in the bathroom where it was regularly steamed up. Tea / coffee making facilities would have been nice also. The carpet was very badly marked and stained including several cigarette burns. The furniture was cheap, shoddy and likewise stained. Our window view was of a blank wall 10m away. We asked to be moved and offered to pay for an upgrade but the hotel was full. We paid 190 Euros for the room per night directly booked with the hotel. The bar was very basic, lacked comfort and atmosphere. It was rarely staffed so you had to interupt the frontdesk for service. Here I admit to being ultra-critical and this probably doesn't matter to most people. However, we like to have a relaxing glass of beer or wine at the end of the day and in the evenings.

Close to Placa de Catalunya (bus stops etc.) and right on the Ramblas. This must have been the friendliest front desk of any European hotel we\u2019ve used. Booked directly with hotel by e-mail. Asked if we could leave luggage until check in time as we were on an early flight, very pleasantly surprised to find room ready for us on arrival. Especially asked for high floor, Ramblas-facing, and we were given a fabulous front (Sarria) room on the fifth floor. It must have been 40+ft long \u2013 two televisions, a table and chairs, very large bathroom with Jacuzzi bath, great shower, double wash-basins and even an exercise bike! Widely spaced double glazing at window combined with blackout linings made for very peaceful nights. Previous reviewers have mentioned the metro noise and I\u2019m sure this is far more noticeable on lower floors, but the trains only run between 5.00am and midnight and the \u2018rumbles\u2019 only last for about 4 seconds each time, and not all that frequently. Far less of a problem than noisy traffic would be for example. It is true that you do need to be alert in Barcelona \u2013 we were walking along by the beach in the middle of the day and were suddenly more or less surrounded by a small group of young men who appeared from nowhere. They were extending their hands as if to shake hands and were speaking in (poor) English. We assertively moved on and they fortunately did not pursue. If they had, we suspect the best form of defence would have been to yell very loudly to attract the attention of other people. The police are in evidence all over the city on foot, in patrol cars and on motorbikes, but of course they can\u2019t be everywhere all of the time. It is also quite good advice to try not to look too much like a tourist. It is after all a city, so you blend in far more in normal casual clothes than in obvious \u201choliday\u201d garb. Taxis were excellent \u2013 plentiful, and not as expensive as London. Easy to use from the airport and as traffic was not particularly heavy we paid only \u20ac22.50. We also used them within the city and found them very reasonably priced and some of the drivers are very happy to point out the sights along the way. Example \u2013 Port area to Parc Guell \u20ac8.50. Bus Turistic also very easy and great way to see a lot of the city \u2013 best value is the 2 day ticket at \u20ac22 per person. Lots of quite poor restaurants around, but did especially enjoy a lunch in the Port Vell area \u2013 La Gavina, by the sea. Not cheap, but delicious seafood.

We received a bottle of Champagne for our honeymoon which we enjoyed very much. We did not have breakfast at the Hotel. Instead, there is a supermarket across from the Hotel where we bought fruit and yogurt for breakfast and enjoyed it on the Solarium on the 6th floor.

From the minute we saw the beautiful outside of this hotel we knew it had to be wonderful inside as well. From the 1st greeting at the reception desk, it only got better. The hotel staff were of the highest professional team I have encountered in any hotel, both in the USA and Europe. We chose one of the superior rooms, with balcony facing \"La Rambla\" on the fourth floor. It was HUGE, with large bedroom, private sitting room complete with TV, easy chairs, cocktail table, that could be closed off completely from the bedroom to allow someone the privacy if they choose to rest while others watch the TV. The bathroom was gigantic, with double sink, sunken jacuzzi tub, an extra large shower, with high-tech water massage jets, which offered about 6 different settings for your pleasure. Also, in the bathroom there were amenities such as,, plush bathrobes and slippers, an exercise cycle, scales, bath salts for the jacuzzi, and wonderful , soaps, shampoos, lotions, after shave, and several other \"personal items\", that were thoughtful for the jet set traveller. The room included 2 TV's, 3 telephones, mini bar, secure safe inside closet for valubles, remote control beds with head and foot adjustments, and a balcony which offered an excellent view of the street below, and of Barcelona. The doors to the balcony are double paned glass, consisting of 2 sets of sliding doors,, offering complete quiet, and solace in your room once they are closed. The bar and breakfast area off of the main lobby are tastefully designed and decorated. We did not take the breakfast on any mornings, however I wished we would have tried it at least once, for I am sure it was equally wonderful. The thing that was most noticeable of all these wonderful assests, was the extreme courtesy, and professional staff, who paid every minute attention to your needs. I will stay at Hotel Montecarlo, again, and again, when returning to Barcelona. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona, that wants to make their visit to this wonderful city, all that more memorable.

The language skills of the staff are excellent - speaking a range of languages. Nothing was ever too much bother for the staff - I cannot praise them enough. Check-in and check-out was very smooth.

Some travel reviews of Barcelona paint a grim/ dangerous picture of the marina/ beach area and the bottom end of La Rambla. I guess these journalists have never stepped far outside Kensington on their travels. These areas are also fantastic. Never saw any problems with crime etc and can testify that there has been a high level of investment in these areas and that they are lovely.

This hotel is rated 3 stars but their huge rooms (even by American standards) have features of 4 and some 5 stars. Located in the heart of the city \"Las Ramblas\" you will get a GREAT VALUE for your money!!! ALL THANKS TO TRIPADVISOR REVIEWS!! This was our very first time using this reviewer\u2019s service. Our double room was modern and spacious. It had as comfortable a bed with dual remote controls allowed either of us to raise or lower head and foot positions for sleeping, reading, or television viewing. The bath featured attractive salmon-colored marble tile, a wood veneer ceiling, full size tub with shower and whirlpool, and bidet. Matching bathrobes and slippers added an accent of luxury. There\u2019s also a rooftop \u201csolarium\u201d with chaise lounges and a view of Las Ramblas below. Free Internet access is available at a computer just off the reception area adjacent to the lounge. More extraordinary than the amenities, however, was the service. Everyone we met was pleasant, friendly, and quick to smile. They provided excellent dining, and tourist planning suggestions. While we were able to handle most matters in Spanish, every one of their staff was able to switch to English easily and spoke it exceptionally well, they all speak Spanish, French, English and local 'Catalan' as you will find out in most places of this impressive city. If you stay here make sure to go to nearby Ciudat Comtal (Bar and Restaurant) for great Mediterranean food, fresh seafood and tapas. Also, take the tourist tour bus and make your visit Poble Espanyol and most of architect Antonio Gaud\u00ed's landmarks (Sagrada Familia, Casa Batllo, La Pedrera, Parc G\u00fcell, etc.). We will make sure that all of our friends, co-workers and relatives that want to travel to Spain go to the unbelievable Barcelona and ONLY stay in this incredible hotel.", "Date": "June 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cAn outstanding hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "KimandMartin", "ReviewID": "UR3570624", "Content": "Just got back from our honeymoon in Spain.
