We had to leave baggage as we were too early to check-in. Therefore the man working on the desk took us through to a room in the back of the hotel. Anyone could get to this room as the room was unlocked and no tags were issued with the bags to say which bags belonged to us. My first impressions of the room were fairly good, very small room but do-able. There was a large mirror, however, it was 6 foot up the wall therefore being 5'6 i could not use the mirror. The major problems happened at night time. We stayed for two nights from New Years eve so expected some noise as people would obviously be out celebrating into early hours. However, the noise ran throughout the night and the walls were extremely thin (presumably plaster walls due to the design of the old house) we could hear every step taken up the stairs through the night. Also, every so often there would be this tremendous sound of water flooding which sounded like it was in our room. I rushed to turn the light on, only to realise it was probably in the wall pipes. However, it was extremely loud and quite frightening, waking me up every time someone went to the toilet above us. On the second night, the noise from other guests was very loud. (Around 4am for a couple of hours)There was shouting, howling, singing, laughing, music, knocking on doors from one large group of foreign boys.(the guests making the noise kept moving about through the halls and the stairway and outside our room where it sounded like they were in our room). I went downstairs to see if there was any staff to complain to at 5am. However, there was no one around to talk to and I had no sleep, for the second night. In the morning we went to the desk to check out and my partner mentioned the room opposite were extremely loud and we had no sleep. The man on the desk was watching football on his computer and he simply said ' well you should have come downstairs' and we counter- argued that we did and there was no one there to complain to. He just shook his head and left us to make our own way out after leaving our suitcases in the unlocked room. The service was very low for a hotel and I advise anyone to think again when booking this hotel. I payed a considerable amount of money for two nights of no sleep and a lack of care and enthusiasm for the guests. I was extremely angry at the hotel for not doing anything about the noise for two nights on the run and for not acknowledging an apology was needed for ruining an anniversary for my partner and I. The only plus point to this hotel was its location which was outside kings Cross station, however I was deeply upset and tired after spending two nights at this hotel that my trip wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoyed as much as it should have been.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich", "Title": "\u201cThe best things come in small packages...\u201d", "Author": "sarahNorwich86", "ReviewID": "UR122000235", "Content": "We also booked the Albion House Hotel but were put in the Melville...and after staying in the Albion the week before, the Melville was even better.

I did some research on Trip Advisor, and on reflection of this booked the \"Newly Refurbished\" part of the hotel. I walked into a cloakroom of a reception, checked in and was pointed towards the new part of the hotel. There was no lift to the room, so had to drag my heavy bag up to the 2nd floor. I opened up the door and was greeted with a reincarnation of my student years in Halls - actually on reflection it was 100 times worse than my student years! It was a tiny room, bathroom like a fish tank, no shower cubicle, just a shower head located next to the toilet. I pulled away the top cover of the bed to be greeted by mysterious white marks on the bedding, I told myself \"it must be washing powder, hmmm\". I had to phone reception to order an iron, but soon found out that there were no phones in the rooms, so had to use my mobile to call them. When I got through I was told they didn't have an iron, at this point, I suggested that a \"Budget\" room that cost over \u00c2\u00a3100 for the night really should have this on offer, amazingly, one reluctantly made its way to me. Since it was only one night, I decided to make the best of the worst and went out for the evening. On my return, I went straight to bed for some much needed sleep, I then realised just how thin the walls were. A hairdryer in the room opposite began to sound like it was in my room with me. I could even hear their text messages coming through. Got to sleep in the end and was so happy to wake up in the morning. I avoided the continental only breakfast option, and proceeded to \"check out\".", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNasty!\u201d", "Author": "snoopy000", "ReviewID": "UR71858893", "Content": "Awful hotel!

The family who run the place actually gave me a discount as I was staying longterm and the fridge and use of the kitchen (although I admit it was basic with a 2 cookers that didnt really work but you're lucky to find that in London) was invaluable. First of all this is a budget hotel - you wont find prices like this in London so it will be basic. If you are looking anything other than okay place to sleep at night go elsewhere. I stayed in a double room (for single price) the first night, which was a little cruddy but okay and the second single room I stayed in was small but clean. They are cleaned daily as are the showers and toilets which I thought were fine( believe me I felt lucky as I had stayed in a young hostel the night before!) The beds were comfy and you get a tv and fridge. There is also a free wireless internet connection in that area too which is very useful. The breakfast was fine but again basic. I understand other peoples concerns about leaving luggage but honestly you cant get into the place without a key or being buzzed in (a fact that is annoying when you are trying to ask for a room!) I was nervous at first but for my part I found it safe and I stayed there on my own for a month! The manager and family were also quite friendly once you got chatting to them and he even let me send a fax from his office. I also believe you can trust their credit card system too and I often went into the office at the back to pay with my card - I think its just where they have the machine though it does seem abit of an odd place to have it. As much as I am grateful for the help I received at this hotel I would have to agree with some of the negative reports too. The staff can be rude and defensive (I experienced this again recently) which is annoying. The stairs are bad and you need to take your time and be careful with them. The hotel is abit shabby and needs updating but as I said - its good for the price. However the one thing that makes me hestitate about going back there is I did find a bedbug in my room and that is unacceptable.

So...allow me to recount the many horrors... On arrival: you can't book in until 2 pm. For those arriving in the morning, this is a real problem as there is no safe place to leave one's luggage; you simply leave it in the rather unappealing reception area. Also, when booking in, I paid by credit card (in advance!), and was nervous about the manner in which my card was taken from me, into another room, and then returned to me along with a receipt for me to sign. Might sound like a trifle, but given the immediate negative impression I formed of the place, it made me really uncomfortable. Rooms: There are no elevators. Neither is there anyone to help you with your luggage. So you haul what luggage you have to your room via the stairs, which are dangerous. There are exposed carpet grippers on the steps, which could very easily pierce unsuspecting feet. The rooms themselves are disgusting. Really, truly disgusting. The carpets are utterly filthy. I would have been afraid to set an un-shod foot on them. The beds are ancient, creaky, and plain dirty. The rooms have fridges, but the inches of grime they've accumulated over the many years since they were last washed would discourage one to actually put any food in them. Similarly with the tea/coffee-making facilities. All of the above, however, was positively sanitary compared to the sink in my (first) room. It was blocked solid, and caked in all manner of grime and gloop. It was so gut-wrenching that I was actually afraid to brush my teeth or wash my face there (I had to go upstairs to use the sink in my friend's room!). Lastly, I had booked a single room, and when I arrived, was put in a twin room. It was not mentioned to me at the time of my arrival that someone had made a mess of my booking, and so I was told on the second morning, as I was on my way out, that I would have to change rooms. Bathrooms: I stayed here on a trip to London with a friend. When we arrived, we were put in rooms on two separate floors. Each floor has 1 shower and 1 WC which serve all rooms on that floor. On the day of our arrival, I found that the shower on my floor (and I don't need to mention at this stage that it was disgustingly dirty) had no hot water supply. The WC on that same floor had no light. On the second night, after my change of room, I was moved to the same floor as my friend. The WC was functional and lit (but filthy), but the door didn't lock properly. And the shower really was the stuff of nightmares. Again, the lock on the door wasn't entirely reliable, and it was even more dirty than the shower on the other floor. Gruesome. Staff: the staff are not helpful at all. Some are downright unpleasant. They tried to make a compliment of moving me to a room on the same floor as my friend on the second night of our stay! Atmosphere: As, by now, you will have gathered, this hotel is dangerously dirty. They offer a continental breakfast, but neither of us was willing to risk eating in this place. Furthermore, it was genuinely difficult to get to sleep there, due the endless noise from the street below. This was a problem particularly on the first night, when a group of idiots spent the night on the steps of the hotel drinking, shouting and bothering passing women. Notably, the staff of the Melville did nothing about this. All in all, I urge anyone who reads this to avoid the Melville at all costs.
