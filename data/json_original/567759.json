We had no hot water (no one else apparently stayed at this location) and the only window opened onto an area that smelled terribly of sewer and had many, many mosquitoes. The next day my husband spent the better part of three hours trying to get it fixed. It was fixed for the second night.", "Date": "Jun 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR988568349", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "oscarh"}, {"Content": "All But the Noise", "Date": "May 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR527257582", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Spaatz"}, {"Content": "Good value       View from balcony", "Date": "Dec 12, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR579922290", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Machaboy"}, {"Content": "Very nice Excellent place to stay. We stayed in the apartment across the road and it was really like having our own place for three days. Christina is very helpful, as are the others on the staff. It's location is super..very close to the train station and santa maria cathedral. Apart from the three flights of stairs to access the main bedrooms, I would highly recommend it! Make sure you let them know if you're arriving after 1.30pm because they really aren't there all the time and I'd say it could be a sour point if you just turn up and expect to check-in after 1.30.", "Date": "Jun 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR271727191", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "FrancescaCork"}, {"Content": "Great Place in Florence! Locanda Daniel was the best place we stayed in Florence. It is a small place on the third floor of a building near the train station. We had their apartment which had a big bedroom, a kitchen with sitting area, and a balcony that you could sit and eat out on. GREAT. Kitchen was well stocked. In a great area, convenient to grocery, restaurants, easy walk from Train Station. Safe. You do have to carry your luggage up the three flights of steps. No elevator. Christina the owner speaks great English and is wonderful. If you email her directly you can get a better deal.

They did go out of their way to try and help me find other accomodations, but just made a big issue about how I can't be changing things all the time. Then they made me change beds every night I was there. The staff is not there after 1:30pm, and is therefore not very helpful or available. The hostel is in a good location and was clean though. A short walk from the train station. I would suggest if you can, request to stay at the hostel they have across the street called Rocamatissi, which is more like an apartment and has a communal kitchen for the same price.", "Date": "Jun 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR664224223", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Frozen and Hapless The Locanda Daniel might be a good, cheap hostel during the summer, but for my week in November they failed to keep the heat on for more than 2 hours a day. They advertise English-speaking staff, but when I went to complain the woman could not understand me. I had to argue in French to get my point across! The bathrooms are not ensuite but are the warmest rooms in the building.
