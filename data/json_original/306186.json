As far as the hotel, like all hotels in Singapore, the lobby is nice, but once you leave the elevator and walk through the maze of hallways to your room, you will probably be as disappointed as I was.

Because of the crowds of \"mass tour groups\" with loud noises checking in, and behaving badly (example, speaking into hand-phones while helping themselves with one hand at the buffet breakfast counters or while checking in, and Mainland Chinese people shouting to each other over the breakfast room.), I choose to pay extra for the Executive Club floors. The staff at the Club Lounge do know how to make one feel really \"at home\" with their friendly smiles, wonderful hospitability and great service. We really enjoyed our stay and return visit (latest return visit was in February 2012) , thanks very much to Ms. Eunice Choo, Ms. Josephine, Ms Apple, Jonathon, and the lovely lady from the Philippines (with the name I cannnot pronounce well). They made our stay a memorable one and we return again and again, to meet these \"friends\" of OPH. However, it would be appreciated if the Management makes sure that guests using the Club Lounge are (a) in fact Club paying guests, (b) observing a certain decent dress code (like, no surfer shorts, no singlets, no slippers) and no unruly behaviour, and to show their respect that this is a Club Lounge where Club guests can meet business associates; and (c) that Club staff have the authority to nicely \"throw out\" guests who are not suitably dressed or too \"loud-mouthed\" (speaking too loudly within the small space of the Lounge) so that other guests cannot read the newspapers or watch tv in the Lounge. Our most recent stay was in the Presidential Suite. Although it was a spacious suite, one can only watch tv from the bed (TV fixed in an unusual position), the colour of the big and long sofa does not match the whole suite (it dominates the room), and the electric water-cooker does not work because the electrical wiring was faulty (the electrician came and showed to us the electrical wires embeded in the wall that have corroded, which he could not fix in one day). Finally, please review breakfast offering in the Club Lounge. It serves Danish pastries and some limited items. In Europe, Danish pastries, especially the sweet ones, are not really a huge favourite amongst the health conscious folks. Because of the limited offering, I had to go down to level 2 to Tung Lok to \"fight\" with the group-tour people (a) for a seat, (b) for the food (they tend to pile up their plates with foods that they later leave half-eaten - what a waste !) - pity that the famous Tung Lok Restaurant foods are treated with such low respect. Despite all this, we return to OPH simply because the staff at Executive Club level treat us like \"we are at home\".

There are many restaurants at the door step. And the shopping experience starts as soon as you step out of the hotel, the Ion Orchard is within 10 min walking distance.

The hotel reminded me of a Mainland China business hotel from the mid-80s, with a few more upgrades. The hotel is in a great location for shopping/being downtown Singapore/Orchard Road, but I would have preferred so many other 4/5 star hotels...this is much closer to what I'd consider a 3-star local business hotel. The lobby was neither cozy nor inviting but it was functional so it is what it is. Checking in took forever (almsot half an hour once my husband was attended to...we had no luggage and he had pre-booked the room--which was guaranteed but somehow not available upon check in; I will give the management credit as we were \"upgraded\" to a Club room....which did allow for free internet, Club access/breakfast, etc.). My husband booked a smoking room and even his upgrade was on a non-smoking floor (but there was an outdoor balcony (with ashtray--non-smoking room?!). The room, again, was functional but nothing special for the price (then again, all Singapore hotels are outrageous....yet, it was still quite high for the calibre of this hotel). I will say that the duvet and pillows were excellent and inviting (...as good as in any five-star and made sleeping very comfortable. I had the opportunity to settle into the bed for a nap, but it was absolutely impossible (even with earplugs) as it was soooo noisy. Granted, it was 2pm and there is no guarantee of quiet during work hours, but the room was so poorly soundproofed that I could hear absolutely anyone/everyone passing the room, the elevator coming/going, noise from above, and even the vibration of guest room doors opening/shutting. I gave up on the nap.) I decided to do some strolling and had a destination in mind (Club Street/An Xiang Hill area...fabulous little boutiques, restaurants/bars and next to Chinatown...so much fun and I highly recommend this area if you have a couple hours to kill, then drinks/dinner in the area), so I asked the concierge to show me the area on a map. I was quite surprised that they had to look it up and didn't know the area (they did know Chinatown but neither of the streets I mentioned...) but they were kind and found the location efficiently. A huge problem on the other hand, is that the hotel doesn't have a \"guest\" line for taxis so I had to wait in line with people just coming into the hotel to catch a taxi...I waited for 40 minutes for a taxi (I actually saw two different groups walk in from off the street to get in line while I was still at the concierge)...I highly suggest that the hotel gives their paying guests preference for their taxi queue (easily done with just a couple of signs and showing your room card). The porters were wonderful though and it's such a thankless job to have to keep rushing out to find taxis for hotel guests; kudos to them for their kindness. As for the pool, I looked out at it from the window and it was not inviting. Certainly large enough for swimming but it's located on a rooftop with sterile surroundings; you can get sun on it, but it would not be a place I'd want to curl up with a good book for hours; for the standard of the hotel though, nice enough. One look at the too-basic gym and I decided to wait til I got back home to work out the following day. One look at the breakfast offered in the Club room the next morning, and I decided to wait until my return to Kuala Lumpur to eat (catering more to Asian breakfast cuisine). All in all, sufficiently clean and well located to stay if solely working and in/out of the hotel....not a hotel I'd want to spend any quality holiday time though (but I assume that's not the purpose of the hotel either....great for bus tour groups and business people who just need a clean/adequate room for a few nights).", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cHome of Shopping, Excellent Internet Service\u201d", "Author": "HotelHopper369", "ReviewID": "UR123240571", "Content": "I'm an avid shopper by nature.

Orchard Parade also checked off all the other essential boxes: our room was clean, had an extremely comfortable king-sized bed, and was pretty spacious. Our only complaint about it was the bathroom. Though fully functional and spotless, it was on the small side. Another minor issue was with one slightly haughty receptionist named Cella. I don't know if she was simply having a bad day, but she was beyond grumpy when we went to ask her a few questions. She spoke to us impatiently as if she had better things to do than talk to paying customers. If she's always like this then she should probably rethink working in the service industry.

Spoke to the front desk who immediately talked to the Assistant to the Hotel Manager, Ms. Ang. This professional woman could not have done more to remedy the situation. I got upgraded to a beautiful room, bellmen moved all the things from one room to another, and had the great opportunity to interact with Ms. Ang and Mr. Willis, the manager. These people could not have been nicer or more professional. My stay was almost 2 weeks.

Nice room, but we did have one over looking Orchard Road, I believe there are a few that don't so just be aware when booking. Also, the hotel itself has no catering facilities, the various restaurants are privately owned and run, a Steak House, Italian, Japanese, Sinapore and Chinese restaurants, The Chinese being on the 1st floor and where breakfast is served, in Singapore it gets a great write up, but it may not be to everyone's taste, it did lack atmosphere, more like a school canteen, could do with more intimate small tables and lower lighting. Because most tables are larger, you may be asked to share your breakfast table with complete strangers, which didn't suit us, so we waited. However, there are some good places for breakfast just a few minutes away, amonst them, Borders. The room was cleaned everyday, the staff friendly and helpful. The pool area was a little disappointing as the 'so called pool bar' wasn't open the entire time we were there. Try out the tailor on the ground floor, geZarino tailors, excellent service, fine tailoring. Lastly, don't go there with preconceived western ideas, this is a Far Eastern Country and you should embrace their culture and ways, 'When in Rome'. If you can't adapt don't go.

It was 11am at the time but the receptionist gave us our rooms right away without early check-in charges. The hotel's configuration is quite unique. We had to negotiate about 7 turns along the corridors since our room was quite far from the elevator. In our excitement to walk around Orchard, this is something we can easily forgive. Our room was a decent Superior room. It had a decent amount of space (just enough), right amount of furnishings and amenities (a sofa and side table, TV, bar, internet, office desk). It has a walk-in closet where the luggage counter is integrated. The bathroom was clean, had a bathtub, hot shower and toiletries. I coudln't find anything that I didn't like. The bed was good, wasn't hard or soft, it was just right. The bedsheets and pillocases felt good on the skin. We had a good night's rest every night. We also used the Internet (7SGD for 30 mins) just to check on e-mail, not bad at all. We also received a daily copy of the Straits Times, good for waiting while the spouse was int he bathroom. We didn't get the chance to try out the other facilities (swimming pool, bar, restaurants), since we just used the room for sleeping and showering. But this is a great-value hotel for this price! It met our minimum requirements, decent staff, good facilities (not spectacular, but good enough), and for that price, it's worth considering for a future stay.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, small bathroom\u201d", "Author": "dopus", "ReviewID": "UR19788996", "Content": "We just came back from Singapore after staying few days in this hotel.The first days we stayed in a big room on the 4th floor.The personal was very helpfull and friendly.It was very big and the bed was great.It was clean and the bathroom was huge.There were some molding spots around the washing table and in the shower.After returning from KL we got a suite on the 17 floor.The reception was fantastic.The room was horrible.The bathroom was tiny,due to a set of wooden doors that didn't close good .They should get rid of the shower courtains they look unclean.The airconditining was so cold that we both got the flu.The breakfast was superb and in the evenings there were delicious snacks and drinks for free.I would say that the service was perfect but the rooms need to be upgraded if they want to keep on charging such a high rates.", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mumbai,", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel with a fantastic location\u201d", "Author": "Shrutinaik Posted by a Cleartrip traveler", "ReviewID": "UR19594476", "Content": "The hotel has a fabulous location with incredible service , it was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go and shop ....", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Raleigh, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cHotel is average\u201d", "Author": "Zacharymia", "ReviewID": "UR19489225", "Content": "Stayed at hotel for business.

(i know all this bcuz i was standing at the frontdesk asking to be checked in before anyone approached me for a good 10 mins. and 10 mins is a long time) all this could probably be becuz im a local. not a tourist. so they rather prioritize the tourists bcuz the tourists are future advocators of the hotel to help spread the word abt the hotel worldwide. the corridors are seriously eerie. so silent that i could HEAR the silence. me and friends experienced some eerie stuffs in the room too. For the amount that i paid for a family suite 600SGD plus or minus, i think that its overpriced and nothing to be wowed abt. For tourists, yes its a good location being that it is in the center of country n near Orchard Rd, but im sure u guys cud use the money and stay somewhr else that is worth the money. Anyways, Singapore is so small, it doesnt matter even if ur not staying in the heart of the city or the center of the country.

Our rooms were wrong, and the reception made absolutely NO intention of righting the wrong. My husband is very large, and they wanted us to sleep in single beds, when we paid for the king bed. She insisted there was nothing they could do, so I asked if she could recommed a hotel that could accomodate me. She handed me a phone book and carried on wioth other business. I was shocked at hold cold she was! THEN...I asked if I paid more, could they accomodate me. Of course they could, money talks (why didnt she just say that in the first place?) We had to pay to upgrade to a room with a King (even though that is in fact what we paid for on-line) and priveledges to use the Business Center which included nightly cocktails and hordervs. Stuart Anderson: As we waited for our room, we decided to eat here for lunch, it was familiar. In the entire restraunt there was my husband & I, and 3 other families. Once our food came, we never saw the waitress again. She left for the day and nobody took her place to help us. Horrible service! Business Center: It was actually very nice and the staff in here was friendly. The most friendly in the entire hotel. We got to know some of the staff and they spilled the beans on \"managment problems\"...saying all staff is unhappy. Our room came with a cocktail hour..but the staff admitted they did not know how to make cocktails. When we asked for drinks, they had no idea what the liquors were called so they allowed to go to the back and pull the liquor ourselves. Only one computer worked the entire time we were there. Light breakfast was also included...not bad. Pool: Nice, quiet, and clean. However, 1 outdoor shower busted and water poured out for over an hour. We let them know, but it obviously wasnt a priority. Salon: At the time we were there, there were 2 salons. One had been located in the Hotel for years and owned by an older woman, the other was fairly new and more modern. I visited the older one...she too spilled her beans as to how horrible the managment has been to everyone. Bottom Line: I would not recommend this hotel to anyone nor would I ever return.

Overall a good experience for the price. This is a solid 3 star business hotel i would say...has a decent pool, with gym. No jacuzzi,...i didnt check for steam room in the gym. The rooms are comfortable.. i had a superior room and a deluxe room due to a mix up. My view on either room was not great....basically, i was facing another building and away from the orchard rd. It the deluxe room (the lesser of the two) was the basic room size...had reasonable internet access....all the regular amenities with security box. ironing board and blowdryer. decent size tv...not flatscreen..and clean beds. the superior room was more spacious..maybe 30% more. Some have seperate shower and tub. others did not... had the usuals...shampoo, conditioner, soap, and a toothbrush. The only thing annoying is, theres only 1 elevator area..and if you so happen to be in the far end of the building...you will be walking thru a number to turns...so, if you can request for a room closer to the elevator, that would be ideal. Also, if you get a far room...which is i think in another building that was later connected...the floors heights between the 2 buildings somehow dont match...and you have to walk down a few steps along the way... no big deal if you are not strolling along luggage. But when you check out, it will be annoying... Main lobby is not very impressive...looks like a business hotel...no grand waiting area, or elegant restaurants... just basic stuff. It is next to starbucks which is a plus if you like starbucks... i personally dont...but some people do. As for breakfast..i didnt check what they had since my room didnt come with a breakfast.
