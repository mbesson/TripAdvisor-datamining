The room was very comfortable with ample wardrobe space for my short stay (probably fine for a few nights for two). The decor took me by surprise with the walls actually being upholstered but it all seemed to work very well. The bathroom was nice and clean and everything worked. The shower is extremely powerful so if you have small children, make sure you turn on the taps very slowly so it's not too strong for them. With the shower that strong, no curtain did mean a lot of water splashing out of the bath, but there were ample towels to dry myself and the floor. With the window shut, the room was very quiet indeed and the only noises I'd hear would be the occasional front door of other rooms on my floor, but no voices etc. Being in the centre of a city, if you open the window, you will hear the traffic! As for the pro's of the location, it was very easy to get to - 2 metro lines serve it (one direct to CDG Airport, the other straight to the Louvre) within 5mins walk. I didn't have any food there, so can't comment on breakfast. Lift access is small, so could be difficult with a large party, or large bags. Staff are friendly and helpful enough. I didn't have any particular need to ask anything out of the ordinary, but I can say they all speak good English when my French got stuck. I'd certainly consider staying here again, particularly if I managed a similar last minute deal. I'd recommend it for anyone able-bodied for single or doubly occupied rooms.

One morning, the water stopped running for about 20 minutes because something happened. Not clear about what. If you are an older person, ask for a room with a step in shower instead of a tub. The tubs are extremely high and difficult to get into. They have no hand rails and the tub in my room leaked.

Apart from that the room was good, a little warm, but clean. The shower was ace, you could move the height, it was powerful enough and got hot very quickly.

We booked the hotel for a 5 nights stay in December for 352 GBP which is really cheap for Paris so we expected a budget hotel. So why is the hotel a good choice? Well, the service is really nice (friendly staff, more than ok English), clean rooms and good shower. For a continental breakfast, the hotel's is nothing less than superb with a good choice of cereals, cold meats, cheese, breads, rolls and various sweet pastries. Also, there's a brilliant pattiserie just near the hotel which you'll spend a lot of money in and it's worth every cent. So why not choose this hotel? Well, the room, while clean, is tiny! We travelled light so managed but I have no idea how you can fit a suitcase there and there's hardly a storage facility in the room. Also, the hotel is quite dated and the room is not really inspiring. The fact that all the relevant metro stations are at least 10 minutes' walk from the hotel could also be a consideration although there's a bus stop that can take to a close proximity of most of Paris' attraction just outside the hotel. In regards to location, this is really a question of personal preferences. We loved the fact that we were in a quiet, half residential area off the beaten track yet still 10 minutes walk from Luxemburg or the Pantheon and just 2 minutes walk from the wonderful Rue Muffetard with its food market in the morning and lively restaurant scene in the evening but it is by no means central.

We used the safe for free (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red button\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is inside the door by the hinge to reset the code) and while the fabric on the walls was a strange choice, our room was not smelly and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any mold as other travelers have mentioned. It really was no different than you would expect in a three-star hotel in the States. We also had an alarm clock and a hairdryer which was a plus. Overall, the hotel was small, but clean and safe. I would definitely recommend it to a traveler on a budget, especially for students. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming to Paris to watch American TV, you should probably just stay home\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat night, there was a news channel and BBC World in English, but we were so exhausted that our room served its purpose as place to crash. However, I would not recommend this hotel to a travel with limited mobility: the rooms were too small to be wheelchair accessible and at times, the small elevator was tied up by staff use. To sum it all up: Clean, safe, great location. Our amazing trip to Paris was possible because of the great sleep we got at the Serotel Lutece.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cCute little hotel\u201d", "Author": "chichobbit", "ReviewID": "UR13102476", "Content": "This hotel is in a really nice location on the Left Bank, about ten minutes' walk from two metro stations, Censier-Daubenton (M7) and Port Royal (an RER line, which also has direct service to Charles de Gaulle airport, a big plus). There are a couple of open-air markets nearby including one on Rue des Patriarches that has great fresh fruit and meats. It's also very close to the Luxembourg Gardens, which are beautiful. Most importantly, the neighborhood is fairly quiet and we felt quite safe, even walking back to the hotel at two in the morning. The room is rather small - it was not easy to get ourself and the luggage past the door because of the bed's awkward location - but the room we stayed in had a great bathroom, much larger than the typical closet-sized European bath. The shower had a removable massage showerhead and the room was well-lit. There is a mini-bar in the room which we used as a refrigerator to store cheese and meat in to keep costs low. The breakfast, included in the rate, is really very good especially by European standards and includes a variety of meats, cheeses, yogurts, cereal, fruits, bread, and eggs plus juice and coffee. We filled up at breakfast and were easily satisfied till a late lunch. There is a TV in the room, but it only had four channels and let's face it, if you are in Paris you're probably not there to watch television! Wi-Fi is available for a fee, but if you have a laptop there are plenty of cafes in Paris which offer free service. The hotel also has a cute little courtyard in back, which was a nice place to relax with a glass of wine in the evenings. Everything was very clean and neat, and the staff were very helpful and cheerful. We arrived a few hours early for check-in but the staff stored our luggage so that we could go sight-seeing without having to worry about it. The one thing that was a little inconvenient was that the elevator went out on the first day we were there and was not fixed for our three-day stay, so we had to walk up to our room on the third floor (actually the fourth; Europeans number the ground floor 0) with our luggage, and there were a LOT of stairs. However, this is fairly standard for Europe.

This was my first stay at thishotel. I saw approximately 15 of the rooms in this hotel. When we arrived, only several rooms were ready. There was some confusion in the room breakdown since we needed multiple rooms for our group. The main desk was helpful and responsive to our issues. Several people in my group needed to stay at a nearby hotel until rooms became available. The rooms here vary in size from VERY small (6' x8'--some referred to these rooms as \"coffins\") to the average European size (15' x 10'). There was one room--this may be the \"apartment\" that the hotel website refers to--which had two rooms with a shower. This room was great--plenty of space and very quaint. Not all rooms have a clock in them--some rooms have a very small shower (2\u00c2\u00bd' x 3') others have a tub with a hand-held shower head. Most rooms have a blowdryer in the bathroom. The toilet is in a small separate room from the shower and sink. The walls in the rooms were covered in fabric--not wallpaper; therefore, some walls had a black substance on them which we believe was mold. This was not present in all rooms. There is a safe in most rooms for 11\u00e2\u201a\u00ac per week. The breakfast in the cellar was good--croissants, bread, cereal, yogurt, fruit, cold cuts, coffee, tea, hot chocolate and fruit juices. There is also complimentary coffee and tea in the rooms. The hotel location is good. The walk to the nearest RER station is approximately a 5-10 minute walk; the metro is slightly closer and passes through more quaint streets like the rue Mouffetard. There are supermarkets, caf\u00c3\u00a9s and a post office nearby. I went to school in France for a year in the 1980s and have stayed at multiple hotels in the Latin Quarter--I prefer this area as it is lively and reasonably priced. This hotel was very average for the area. Would I stay at this hotel with my family? No, I would not. It was reasonably priced, but the mold on the walls and the size of the rooms and shower stall would deter me. I am not a larger person (5'4\" and not overweight) and I was squished in the shower stall. My 6'6\" husband would NEVER fit into the shower stall. There are other hotels (check the rue du Sommerard), within the same price range which offer more breathing room. As I told my students before this trip--you are in Paris-one of the most beautiful cities in the world--have FUN and enjoy it. You will only spend limited time in the hotel. The French love their city and country and are very proud--if you have a complaint, voice it politely. If you already have reservations at this hotel--don't panic--it will be fine.

When we went up to our floor on the elevator, the corridor was pitch black and we had to somehow feel our way to our room and unlock the door.
