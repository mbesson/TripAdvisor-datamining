However there are many hotels in this area and you may do better to choose one of those. We stayed at the hotel for four nights in late December 2008. The staff were pleasant enough but were not what I would call friendly, no-one smiled. We were not told that you had to hand in your key to have your room serviced. Not a big deal. On the occassion that our room was serviced we were left with 2 towels and only one hand towel / bath mat and a third of a roll of toilet paper. We were given a room on the first floor. We could clearly hear the noise from the street and the noise from reception. The room was very small and dated (wallpaper stained and peeling and industrial carpet). By a very small room I mean bed pushed up against the wall and 3 feet of space around the bed. The only furnishings in the room were the bed, one side table, a cupboard, a roof mounted tv and a curtain that did not cover the window properly. There was no fridge like other reviews suggest. The bathroom smelt of cigarette smoke (the roof was blackened, not sure what from) and was also tiny. The shower was tiny (3 feet x 2 feet) and had no shower curtain or shower door. I believe the hotel is rated 3 star but it would be pushing to be 2 star anywhere else in Europe. The breakfast was in the hotel across the street and it was a good continental breakfast. I would only suggest staying at this hotel if you were staying for a night or two, were guaranteed a room above the first floor and were not paying a great deal.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sardinia", "Title": "\u201cPerfect!
