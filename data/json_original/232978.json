{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Bella Firenze This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. Our first experience was positive so we decided to try them again but this time we stayed for two weeks using Florence as our base to explore the city and region. The staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant. The room they gave us was quite large and well appointed. The only criticism was the quite appalling coffee that was served in the morning! Apart from that the place was fine. The location did not bother us as we like to walk and explore 'off the beaten track' and we also used the excellent bus service. There are good restaurants in the area especially a Ristorante/Pizzeria called La Luna which was excellent.

While it is not a bad hotel, it is small and different than what the typical american is looking for. I had been living in Europe so I was used to these differences, but took my parents while in town. They were dissappointed at what passes for a typical mid-priced euro hotel. Pro's, quiet area, not too rowdy when I was there, there was a charming restaurant down the street with a small outdoor seating section to enjoy a quite Florentine evening as a local might, rather than the busier, hustle and bustle sections.the older lady who was in charge of the breakfast bar, was a trip. she was like one of the little old italian ladies in the first godfather while Michael is in Sicily. She was curt by friendly, and always kept an eye on you... as if you might walk off with an unaccounted for danish... Cons: A/C in europe doesn't usually meet american standards, Hotel Jane is no different, it was quite warm in July, don't expect to come back to a crisp cool 68 degree room... haSmall bathrooms are also the norm in the european side of the world, again Hotel jane, no different.Parking can be a pain if you come and go during the day, if you are not parked by a certian time at night, forget about it.Overall it is a hotel that can allow you to save some cash if you book at the right time and will allow you to spend more on other Florence/Tuscany things to do. But nothing to write home about. Some other reviewers have commented on the staff... honestly their negative impressions were a surprise, the management when I was there seemed to blend in with the walls.", "Date": "May 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR779450721", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MD4now"}, {"Content": "Loved Florence, shame about the Hotel Having come back from a 4 night stay in lovely Florence the experience would've been much better if the level of service had been as good as Florence itself. On check in we were given a room on the top floor right next to the lifts. As soon as we walked into the room we were disgusted with the size and the whole feel of it. The walls were paper thin and having the lift right next to it we were not gonna get any sleep. We went straight back to reception and luckily they changed the room to downstairs next to the reception. The room was bigger and even had a balcony area which was nice, apart from that the room was standard.The room was quite cold so we wanted to put the heating on, but was told by reception that the heating comes on automatically at 7pm and nothing we can do about it!! So we just had to put on a couple of layers on until we were warmer. Each night we must have got no more that 6 hours sleep, me and the missus enjoy staying up late drinking and chilling out so enjoy having a lye in but this was not to happen as you can hear the night staff snoring away in the room next door and everyone gathering in reception talking loudly for no reason at all early morning at 6am!! So having a lye in was NOT an option at Hotel Jane.After a long day walking we came back to the hotel and fancied a hot beverage so went to reception and asked for a hot chocolate. We were told that we cannot order any hot drinks until after 8pm and guess what time it was? 7.55pm For the sake of 5mins they refused to serve us hot drinks as apparently they only serve it for 2 hours in the evening!! I have never heard any rubbish!! They had actually asked us to come back rather than take our order and serve us after 8pm!! In the end we decided to go to the nearest cafe and spend our money there instead. The day before we were leaving we were rudely advised by an elderly member of staff on reception that dont forget to check out by 11am tomorrow, considering our flight was at 10am we were fully aware of what time to check out. Instead of making you feel welcome they didnt appear that bothered with our custom. Overall we had a fantastic time in Florence, it could've been a better remembered holiday if the hotel service was good. My advise is to spend that little bit extra and go elsewhere.", "Date": "Jan 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR606949939", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Nikhil_V"}, {"Content": "Don't Bother... Not Worth the Money Though the location of the hotel was fine... away from the tourist trap center, the hotel has MUCH to be desired. The staff was rude and unfriendly. I have traveled for many years and stayed in a variety of upscale and lowbrow hotels, inns, and BB's, and I've never been received with such disrespect. And my husband and I are EXCEEDINGLY low maintenance, which is why we picked this hotel!!! When I asked if they could suggest a local restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday or secure a taxi to the local golf course, they informed me that they were only a three star hotel and that I should find another hotel if I required those types of services! Moreover, they added, they were not making a profit off of our room since we had booked with a travel agency far in advance of the high season!! And we stayed for 10 days!!! They also refused to hold my husband's valuables in the hotel safe. They were just as rude to the other guests, barking at what table one could /could not sit at for breakfast. I was scared to even make eye contact with the staff for fear I was bothering them, whether it was for a second cup of coffee or asking for directions to the local bank. In the spirit of their you're not profitable guests attitude, we were given a TINY room next to the elevator --even after I had requested a room away from the noisy elevator--with an even tinier shower. Obviously NOT built for the average 5'6, 140 lb person. Imagine showering in an upright coffin, except there's actually more room in a coffin. It was impossible to shower without bruised elbows. The room air conditioning and breakfast was the only thing worthy of mention in this hotel. Breakfast was actually good and filling (bread, cold-cuts, cereals, juice, yogurt, cappuccino), considering the bad attitude, surliness, and ill-mannered personnel. The night staff, though not as rude, didn't speak English. We had to literally mime for a 7:00 AM wake-up call! The free internet service is also a scam. One computer for use by two hotels, and it wasn't even housed at the Hotel Jane. Florence is glorious, the food magnificent, it's people warm and gracious.

It gets crowded and people don't realize they are being robbed from b/c it is so tight anyway. The room was small but the bathroom was great for European standards. The room we had downstairs was not ideal. The walls were paper thin b/c we were apparently next to the office. So on shift changes, it was noisy. In particularly at bedtime, as late as 11pm. After the first night, it wasn't as bad. Francesca was very helpful at the front desk. In the evening, the people knew less English but they got by. There is free internet across the street at their sister hotel. That was great and no one else was ever using it. They had a light breakfast but it was good. They made great cappucino.

Also this 'double' room is too small for more than one person to stand up in. if you want to unpack or dress, your room mate must stay on the bed. The disgusting orange walls don't help either. Everything said about size of bathrooms is accurate too. You can only stand sideways in the shower. Apart from breakfast which is average there is no service in this hotel.

We had purchased the two day bus pass so we could board the #14 bus (as recommended by a Trip Advisor member in the Forum) rather than make the rather long walk with luggage. The rooms were very clean and modern. Be warned that the elevator and enclosed shower are rather small. Also bring eyeshades if you are someone who wakes up as soon as the sun peaks in your window as the windows do not block the light well. The room was quiet, though, as this hotel is located in a residential neighborhood, about a 20+ minute walk from the Duomo. Breakfast consisted of the requisite hard rolls as well as warm croissants, assorted cold cereals, meat and cheeses, individual yogurts, choice of many fruit juices, bottled water and warm beverage (coffee drinks, tea, or hot chocolate) The breakfast attendant re-filled the items as needed as the morning wore on. The hotel also has a bar area midway between the basement breakfast room and the main level if you would like a drink; just ask the person at the front desk and they will act as bartender. The sweeping open stairway makes all levels visible from the lobby. There is free internet access available at the hotel across the street, which the Jane is affiliated with. Another plus is the fact that there are several less expensive but excellent restaurants within a couple blocks.

We stayed there because of all the good rewiews here on Trip Advisor so maybe I expected more and got too excited. Let me just make it clear that most of the ratings are too high for this hotel. I am an avid traveler and I also travel on a budget so I don't expect perfection and I'm not overly picky, so here is the honest breakdown-- The pros: The location is in a quiet, safe neighborhood. The staff is very helpful and somewhat friendly, but nothing to get excited about. The breakfast is included in the room, and it consists of pastries, dry cereal, yogurt and limited fruit. Coffee, milk, and juice are also available.The coffee was superb! The room and bathroom were very clean, but small of course. The hotel is right near the river Arno, which you can walk along and take it all the way to the heart of the city. It is a pleasant walk and beats going through town unless you want to make stops along the way. The balconies are a nice plus, you can watch everything going on in the street below. They have awesome shades too that pull down, good for security and block out all light if you want to sleep in. The cons: You will hear every noise from surrounding rooms if they are occupied. You will also hear every sound from the hallway outside your door. We were awakened several times in the middle of the night (2 AM or so) to people coming in. The location- it is FAR from what most people want to see while in Florence. I read a lot about this hike before we went. I love walking so it didn't bother me, but it WILL bother some people, and taxis are expensive (Appx 15 Euro each way). We didn't mind it taking us 30 minutes to walk at a fast pace to the St. Maria station, the center of town. Aside from the hotel itself, most local shops clerks nearby were not friendly at all. (And I speak enough Italian for them to be more considerate. I'm not a rude American.) Do hit La Taverno which is a few blocks away, the front desk will send you there. It was incredibly awesome! Overall, the hotel is great, especially if you are out site seeing all day anyway, but it is nothing more than an average place. I would consider staying there again. (If you are interested in seeing more of the hillside and villages, you should consider staying outside the city. Florence is dirty and overcrowded, you will definitely have to take a tour to see the more beautiful parts of Tuscany. It all depends on what interests you.)

I am confident you wont find anything close.Logistical notes: The #14 bus is around the corner and goes right to the train station and Duomo. Also the hotel recommends two restaurants.

We were searching for a good economy hotel near the attractions. What we found was better than most three star hotels and comparable to some four star hotels in Italy. Here is my rundown of the good points and other considerations of the place:The Good:(1) The rooms were very clean and the furniture in wonderful shape. A nice plus was a ceiling fan and a reasonably updated bathroom. The maid service was consistently good and we found ourselves with large and clean terrycloth towels every day.(2) Staff was wonderfully helpful in giving directions and information for buses, laundry facilities (which are not on site unfortunately), and information on attractions. Our room was filled with brochures and other helpful tourist information.(3) Breakfast was reaonably good with a selection of pastries, meats, cheese, bread, coffee and other beverages.(4) There is internet access at the nearby sister hotel, Hotel Orcagna (across the street), although it is limited to one computer and one has to watch the tourists who comandeer it (we had to vie with rude German tourists). The service is free. (5) The hotel is close to the attractions in Florence, but not right on top of them. In other words, you find yourself in a pleasant, safe and more quiet neighborhood within fifteen minutes' walk to places like the Uffizi Gallery.Other Considerations:(1) The rooms are indeed small. It would be difficult to put more than two people in a room and I could imagine that if you had loud neighbors, you might hear them. The bathrooms as well are small and equipped really for showers. One has to manuever a bit to use the toilet because of how the space is allocated.(2) For some (beyond 60 years old or disabled), the strolls to the tourist attractions may be too long. My wife and I are healthy and in our 30s and we found the walks pleasant.(3) We did encounter a mosquito or two in the hotel. The ceiling fan was a good antidote to this and we found this issue relatively minor.On the whole, the Jane is a great choice for a tourist in Florence.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR356168092", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Loved Hotel Jane Hotel Jane was great for the money!

They had a nice breakfast--plenty of food and pleasant service. The breakfast was included in the price of the room. We got a very good price--99 Euros for a large three person room.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR513901476", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Pretty good hotel for price......a very long walk We stayed in this hotel in March 2004. It was one of about 35 on a two month Europe trip. For the price ($60) it was fabulous, however, like the rest of these reviews, it was very very far away. We walked about 30 minutes to get to the Duomo (and we are young!) There is a bus line that comes close however. Also the breakfast in the morning is great, free cappuccinos and a lot of food. The shower was so small though, that I could barely left my arms.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR553405315", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1",
