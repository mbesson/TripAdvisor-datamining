The rooms were clean, the rooms with the jacuzzi were really nice, the bed was comfortable and there was nothing to complain of. Great location very close to the boardwalk, and I definitely suggest paying the extra $20/day for preferred parking. This hotel is what I would expect of a \"beach\" hotel. There was a DVD player, flat screen TV, fridge, makeup remover wipes in the bathroom, and a microwave and plenty of space in the room. The outside pool was clean and definitely a nice way to cool off. I would recommend this hotel to anybody who isn't looking for anything fancy and top of the line. All that said - I think there could be a few very minor improvements. The upgrades they made in 2012 to the room furnishings were fabulous. However, I wish they would have upgraded the shower curtain in the bathrooms - it looks like $1.00 cheapee you pick up at a general store. The curtain itself is functional but I think something a little nicer looking would do wonders for the bathrooms. I know in our room the sticker on the fridge that indicates that the fridge is off for energy conservation was worn off making it nearly illegible. So I spent the first few minutes wondering why the fridge was warm until I was able to make out the sticker on the front. Those are really my only two suggestions.

Staff greeted us every time we walked by the desk. And even gave us some suggestions on some rainy day activities. It's a cute little beach place.

Pros: the lobby smells like subway, big plus!

Cons: Sand in the bed or something, I know others have said this but I assumed it was a one off item but that is not the case. This hotel clearly does not change their sheets regularly. Toilet was broke, I had to fix it multiple times myself because the back kept getting stuck so it would not fill up. One elevator that is slow as hell, the stairs are WAY faster. The parking: If parking could be any worse it would be clear off the island, nothing like driving around a place you do not know with vague instructions on where to park \"its a block down\". The Staff: it appears many of these people do not care about their guests and if you write a bad review on here they follow up with pure lies (I will be expecting one claiming we was kicked out, or re-booked, or tried to get a free room, neither of which we did, or ever will do). On top of all this I don't think they greeted us a single time when we went in or out. The door keys: some reason it took several tries to get them to work on occasion.

I had mixed feelings about this hotel due to some good and bad reviews. Check in was quick and easy, staff was friendly. We did a thorough inspection of the room for bed bugs and were happy to find no evidence, they did have one of the beds covered with a protective cover. The room looked modern and clean at first glance. However, we found crumbs, dirt and sand on the mattress and inside of the pull out sofa. This was discouraging since we drove a long way and were very tired (it was after 11pm). We contacted staff right away and they apologized and offered another room, we did have to drive back down to the main hotel to get the key. We checked out the other room and the pull out couch was in the same condition and there was a strong musty smell in the room, so we decided to stay in our original room. In the morning, housekeeping came and rectified the problem by replacing the mattress on the sofa bed. I would have preferred they cleaned it and vacuumed again but it worked and they were very nice. The screen door on the patio was also broken when we arrived and someone came out to fix that the next day also. The rest of our stay was great, one short block to the boardwalk, the pool was right outside our door with an outdoor shower and the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable! There were plenty of extra pillows. Parking is tight but staff offered that parking is allowed in the handicapped space to accommodate all guests. We were on the second floor and did hear footsteps and some noise from the neighbors but nothing that we lost any sleep over. The balcony is great with two tables and four chairs, ours was overlooking the Philadelphia Ave. Housekeeping came daily to ask if we needed anything. There were two tv's, one in each room with lots of channels that kept my kids busy when needed. The rooms are separated by a small kitchen, stocked basically, and large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub. For my picky taste, I didn't want my family to use the tub since it didn't look like it was scrubbed but it was clean enough to shower in and very roomy. Overall, I think this suite was a great value for the money and we would probably stay here again. Hopefully management can rectify the issue with the sofa beds being cleaning by housekeeping and a more thorough cleaning of the entire room regarding dusting, vacuuming and scrubbing the bathtub (behind dressers also). Compared to other places we've stayed in Ocean City in the past, this place is probably the best value for the money.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNOT TO BE SLEPT IN\u201d", "Author": "Koala B", "ReviewID": "UR139024613", "Content": "If you're looking for a place to store your bags while you hit the beach or boardwalk, the Monte Carlo is just the place for you.

Our room was listed as a city view but when we went onto our balcony we had a very beautiful view of the bay and the ocean. The room was clean and I loved the colors. The walls were a creamy peach and a light greyish blue with dark chocolate furniture. It was very relaxing. I had never stayed here before so I was very worried about how the room would be but I was very happy with it. It is located near a good part of the boardwalk, has a nice rooftop area with a pool and jacuzzi and an area to just lounge. Front desk was nice. Inside pool was very small, it looked like people were just using it to wash sand off of them. There was only one elevator and it was very slow, but there are numerious locations for stairs if you choose to use them instead. Parking, isn't the greatest. It's across the street and another location for parking further down, if you are going to stay here I would recommend paying the twenty dollars for a reserved spot near the hotel. My only complaints about our room are the coffee pot was filled with water and coffee grounds and there was growth inside that showed it hadn't been cleaned out in at least a week. (however there are numerious places to buy coffee near by). Also on the back of the door in the hotel room it says the hotel is a smoke free hotel no smoking in or outside of the hotel. A man two rooms down kept smoking on his balcony, because of it I couldn't enjoy my balcony as much as I would have liked I called the front desk to say something about it and was informed it was okay to smoke on the balconies. If they are going to list themselves as a smoke free hotel they need to be a smoke free hotel. Other than those two things everything about our stay was great.

There is also a bar at the Plim Plaza that plays music pretty loudly on a daily basis so if you're staying street side be aware of the noise.

The manager seems kind of cheap. We noticed that there is a very minimal amount of staff, perhaps why people's rooms don't get clean and if you needed something there was a good chance they couldn't help you. The maid service was never prompt. We left the room extremely early a lot of the days and would put the \"maid service\" sign up but would return a few hours later to see that the maid was still working at the other end. We noticed one man who was an employee at the hotel who was extremely rude to customers. I was in the elevator with him a few times and when people got on the elevator with sand on their feet he'd start talking about the audacity of them coming into the hotel with sand on their feet and that they should have to clean it up. This was after they left which made me really paranoid he would talk about me after I left. Overall, this hotel is no frills and absolutely nothing special.

Lets start with the cons first. 1) The staff who work the front desk(esp. the foreign ones) have no idea how to communicate. One of them kept telling me she was new which was really not my problem. The washer and dryer I THINK was broken, depending on who you talked to. AT BOTH hotels. Their was of dealing with it was to tell you there was a public laundry on 8th street. We learned after we put our money in that it was broken because there is no sign. The housekeeper told us they had been broken for at least three weeks. When calling the location on 3rd they would tell you they didnt know it was broken. Every person we talked to told us a different story. Just put an out of order sign on it. And if it is that easy to take four kids to walk 4 blocks to wait an hour for it to be done...maybe they should try it once. Don't even ask for a manager because anytime you need him he either has left for the day or off the following day.... 2) we thought the suites would be a family place...sleeps 8...perfect if you are traveling with kids...well....also perfect if you are 18 and can split the cost 8 ways...the hotel has no lobby, so there are no employees there, they give you a code to get in the door which can be passed around very easily. So if you like swimming in the pool area with the morning after contraseptive boxes laying around, and if you like getting ice thrown at you from the balconies and enjoy not sleeping because they are still partying at 3am, than it might be the place for you. Cig bud everywhere in the non smoking hotel and beer cans everywhere... Dont get me wrong the week was fine and we didnt have any problems until the weekend rolled around. But it came with a bang and ruined the last part of our trip. 3) We booked early. In Jan to come in June. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! They were offering the same room at 120 less a night than what we paid for it because they were trying to get the rooms filled. 6 nights at 120 less...you can do the math.. When I called, the foreign girl whom I mentioned earlier told me I should have considered it lucky they even had a room when we booked it and when I asked to speak to the mgr...guess what, he wasn't there. So serioulsy wait until about a week before you go..the vacancy sign was lit the entire time we were there....They wont refund your deposit unless it is longer than ten days before your arrival...so I guess book, and 11 days before you go cancel and odds are they will have a room a lot cheaper...720 cheaper to be exact. 4) the location was a great to walk to the beach and boardwalk, but again there were a ton of abnoxious kids and they just ruined everything... 5) the pool they had was beautiful but it was covered and FREEZING!!!! No one was ever in it...wonder why??? The Pros.. 1) the room was beautiful. Very spacious. Held 4 adults and 4 kids very well. The heated water was shocking! Never have I stayed in a hotel where 8 showers can be taken and not run out of warm water. Comfy beds. Jet tub. Deck had two tables and enought chairs. 2) the housekeeping gave us all the towel and washclothes we asked for. And althought we didnt request the service everyday, he was very nice and polite to us and always told us hello. 3)Easy access to the beach and boardwalk. It really is a shame this hotel is in the location it was. I have been to OC many many times over the years and usually stay further down the boardwalk. The teenage/college age kids there just really ruined it for us to the point where we might try going somewhere else. I'm not sure if it was the location or the time of year we went. We have gone this week for the last four years and never remember so many younger disrespectful kids. The location and cost of this location had to play a role! Overall the hotel was very nice but I would NEVER stay there again. They need to kick out the kids and get some staff to maintain the chaos there a little better. If I rated based on the kids, I would had given it a 1 but really the hotel is beautiful. And based on the look of the room I would give it a high rating.

If it was all that horrible the 1st time we went, we would have never came back to stay for a 2nd time.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel Value EVER!\u201d", "Author": "DCBBW", "ReviewID": "UR106503294", "Content": "This was my second year staying at the Hotel Monte Carlo and I was not disappointed again.

The hotel staff was extremely friendly and the room was clean. Don't go by the hotel website because it makes it look more upscale that it actually is. Very vanilla. The room has the basics but no more. Standard beds, standard bath and a small kitchenette. Some suggestions that I would make to bring it up to par with other basic oc hotels are: furnish icebuckets and ice for the rooms ( we were told to make ice in our freezer w/ the ice tray however they only provided one tray that was very very small. we were also told that we could buy bagged ice at the local 7-11 however that would never fit in the freezer), need a hook in the bathroom to hang wet bathing suit, need some kind of glass or paper cups on the room( we had to go down to the desk to ask for cups and they asked if 2 was ok, i asked for 4 and that was ok. they acted like they were rationing them per room ) and the chairs on the balcony need a major upgrade- very uncomfortable. The indoor pool was about the size of a large hot tub. More than 5 people and it would be crowded. The parking was quite unique as they had about 8 spaces under cover and just outside the lobby not including the handicap spaces. The rest of the spaces were across the street which is not unusual for OC hotels. However, if you wanted to park in the spots undercover ( not including handicap) you were required to pay an extra $20.00 per night to park there. I have never heard of a parking fee at any hotel in OC except this one. The handicap and parking across the street was free. Would I stay here again? Probably not. MY husband and I like something that is not so vanilla.

I know we all try to let our kids handle things on their own to teach them responsibility. Don't do it with this hotel. A call was made in front of a me and my husband to cancel reservations within this hotels policy guidelines. The father actually dialed the telphone # to the hotel and handed the boy the cell phone to cancel. We know that 6/1 was the last day to cancel to stay within the policy guidelines. My son was ask for a reservation # which he did not have in front of him, so the person on the line pulled it up by the name on the reservation. It sounded like he was having no problems cancelling the resaervation and we thought it was a done deal. He said he was told they would get their deposit back. There was call made on that same evening by my son and he spoke with the same person. He said he and his friends were going to try and come for the week of July 17th(still trying to give the hotel their business) and hold the deposit instead on sending it back and then the boys having to return it if they were able to get together for July week. He said he would call back the end of the week which he did on 6/4 staing that the boys could not all get together for the week of July 17th. He was told he would get his money back, but less 25% and he agreed. He called on 6/7 to check staus on refund and was told that it did not go out yet, nothing about not be refunded. He called yet again on 6/14 to speak with Beth who told him that they would NOT be getting a refund because they did not cancel until 6/4. I was told how rude she was and when she was ask for a supervisor or mangaer my son was told she was the super or manager and the refund was not being sent. It is to my understanding that Beth is nor a supervisor or manager. I have phone records of 2 calls on 6/1, a call on 6/4, 6/7 and 6/14 from my sons cell phone. These were sent to the hotel and they have still decided to keep the boys approx. $700. I received the log and they have all the calls except the two on 6/1. My husband tried to make calls begin 6/15 but never got the general manager. He spoke to Beth and she told him to call the next day and speak with Roshani(hope spelling right). He did speak with her and she was going to look in to it and call him back. Not sure what she was looking in to but after waiting for some time he decided to call her back and was told no refund. Another angry father called and he was able to speak with Don the general manager and got VERY upset becasue the hotel stated they have no calll from 6/1 but only 6/4. The hotel was sent records of my sons cell phone and Don the GM stated that that meant nothing to them. Suggeated that what did we try and canel the reservations twince on 6/1, how stupid Don. The first call was to cancel and the second call was try try and come for July 17th and make your bosses more money then the $700 you kept. Where are these OWNERS, have they read any of the reviews on the mold, stench, crap on the toliets, taking money off of peoples charge cards after being home two weeks and not returning their monies either. They always seem to have an EXCUSE. PEOPLE read the reviews of this hotel. There are some good but the bad ones sounds like the hotel looks for every chance to get EXTRA MONEY. Read the reviw titled \" Monte Carlo Suites are not so sweet', sounds like other teenagers had deposit issues. I would suggest that anyone having problems like we did call the Better Business Bureau, Greater Chamber of Commerce and go on line to the Attorney General of Maryland and completed a complain form as I am doing. I tired to find out who the owners are or have them contact me but I was shut domw on that. Hank said this could only be done through Don the GM(that will gwet me nowhere fast). Don you should be ashamed of yourself and I am sure you will have some lame EXCUSE as always. All the facts are in this review people.

Like the title of this review the hotel was almost nice, but not quite. PROS: Great location, less than a block from the boardwalk and close to the bus stops. Room and bathroom were clean Rooftop pool was nice and 3' depth was perfect for playing with a toddler. CONS: Only 1 elevator led to long waits. Constant wet floors in elevator and tiled areas outside the elevator. Subway restaurant on the 1st floor made the entire hotel (but not in my room) smell like nasty baking bread 24/7. The indoor pool was tiny and the pool room was very hot, making it unusable. The sliding glass door to the balcony was a mess, old and in need of replacement. This was probably the biggest con by far. It wouldn't slide easily at all, you had to use a lot of force and push back and forth a lot just to get it to move. My wife couldn't budge it most of the time. When you were fortunate enough to get the door slid closed, a lot of the time it wouldn't close all the way and the top was left open a crack. At night even that small 1/4\" crack let in a lot of street noise. With the door closed the noise wasn't a problem at all. It sounded like most rooms had this problem because you could hear the noise of people struggling with the doors all around you. A real hassle. The room itself was ok, with 2 quuens beds, a couch, a small table with 2 chairs, and a small kitchenettte there was plenty of room for the 3 of us. The lobby was very small so it made it difficult to move around if there were people at the front desk. All-in-all, just an ok place. For the price I expected a little more.", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bel Air, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cIt's Ok\u201d", "Author": "LuvOCMD30", "ReviewID": "UR68853090", "Content": "Went went to Ocean City, MD for a girls weekend. We are in our late 20's early 30's. We go to OC every year. The staff was very nice and pleasant. The view from the pool deck was great and the pool was very nice. The pool was very clean with plenty of chairs to use. The pool was never crowded. The convenience of being so close to everything on the boardwalk was great. The walk to the beach was easy. The carpeting in the guest rooms was new. Both beds in the rooms had 4 pillows on each. The downfalls to the hotel was first the parking. The hotel only has about 8 spaces underneath of the building itself. So if you are checking in on a busy day, like Friday, there is no were to leave your car while you unload. There were multiple other cars at the time of our check in already taking the small 3 car unloading spot along the curb. The parking lot is across the street from the hotel with minimal amount of spaces and the spots are super small. A full size SUV would have a very hard time parking in the space provided. Needless to say, we never moved our SUV thinking that we wouldn't have any spaces available once we returned. There is an additional parking lot available to guests but it is a block away from the hotel. The second downfall to the hotel is that the rooms smelled old and musty. It had an old cigarette smell. We sprayed the room with some air freshener and turned on the A/C. By the next day the smell had reduced. The bathrooms were somewhat clean and needed updating. The third problem was the shower is old. The worn out shower head would not stay in one place in the holder. One other thing to keep in mind is the hotel only has one elevator. So if you are going to be checking in on a busy Saturday I am sure the elevator would be a pain. If we were waiting to long for the elevator we would just take the stairs.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Damascus, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cThank You Monte Carlo\u201d", "Author": "ksmpuddins", "ReviewID": "UR68438095", "Content": "I just had to write a review, we just return from a week long stay at this hotel and it was awesome!

But for the prices we paid we expected none of the problems we ended up having. Also, I did not report a lot of these things to the hotel while we were there because everything we did complain about to them they did not do anything to take care of or fix. (With the exception of the blonde woman at the front desk who was very nice) My boyfriend and I just stayed at this hotel for my birthday. We wanted to stay somewhere nice but we don't have much money so we were only able to stay 2 nights in the middle of the week. Our room was $270 for 2 nights and from looking at the hotel's website it looked like a great place so we figured it was going to be worth the price. But we were wrong and it was a horrible experience. As soon as we got into the room there was trash on the floor, a bunch of candy wrappers. There was a sour smell coming from the fridge, and water was leaking out of it. There were black stains in the ice trays that looked like mold and when I tried to wash them the stains would not come out. There were stains on the couch, chairs, sheets, walls, and ceilings. Thankfully I always bring my own sheets and blankets to hotels so I didn\u2019t have to worry about sleeping on the stained sheets. There also appeared to be mold (more black spots) on the walls in the bathroom, which also had a bad smell. The towel bar in the bathroom was also broken. Although this is a non smoking hotel there were cigarette burns on the chairs. Both beds in the room squeaked horribly even when you made the slightest movement and were very uncomfortable. There were no batteries in the remote for the TV. I called and asked for batteries but the man at the front desk told me he didn't think they had any but he would call me back and let me know. He never did. $135 a night and we can't even have batteries for the remote? There was a TV channel list in the room, but we did not receive a lot of the channels we were supposed to, and since we never got batteries for our remote we could not try to manually enter in channels to see if we could get them. An Indian girl checked us in and we gave her our credit card and everything seemed to be fine even though her English was almost completely un-understandable. After we went to the beach we came back and our room keys didn't work. When we asked why the woman at the front desk (a different woman with blonde hair) told us they de-activated our room keys because we had not paid! They had LOCKED us out of our room. When we told her we gave them the credit card when we checked in, she told us she'd find out what was going on. Apparently the woman who checked us in never charged our credit card! Although it took some time the blonde woman was helpful and understanding and we eventually got back into the room. The hot tub was also broken as soon as we got there and we asked about it and once again they said they did not know when it would be fixed, and that they would call us and let us know but they never did and it was never fixed. The air conditioner in the room stopped working in the middle of the night, but the next day it started working again. When we checked out at 11am we asked if we could leave our car in the parking lot for one hour so we could go to the beach. Keep in mind check in is not until 4pm so there would not be new guests for at least a couple more hours. The Indian woman told us \u201cno not really\u201d. You would think for the price we paid and all the problems we had they could at least let us leave our car in the lot for one measly hour after checking out but no. I will say that the location of the hotel is good, and the pool/deck area on the roof is great (except for the broken hot tub) and most of the time we had the pool to ourselves, but there were so many other problems it was hard to make the best of it. What really upset me was that this was my birthday trip and not only were we not able to afford a longer stay, but the time we did have there was full of stress that I did NOT want to have to deal with on my birthday. Regardless of the hotel we still had a good time in Ocean City. But we will definitely never stay here again unless they offered us a free room that would be clean with no problems.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome two thumbs up\u201d", "Author": "sandylouhd", "ReviewID": "UR66666576", "Content": "Everything was great location.

Being naive and excited, we failed to report these things, as we didn't find them immediately. The help at the front desk is not help. They could not tell us where public parking garages. We had to call down numerous times to have the pool unlocked, which was supposed to be already openend. Also the distance, while not far, was somewhat of a hassle if we needed assistance from the front desk. We knew that checking out might be a little troublesome, but never imagined the crap the hotel pulled on us. Being seniors, we had to give them a $500 security deposit for damage done to the room and the cleaning service. Upon check out we were supposed to get $480 back ($20 for room service). We even read the manual in the suite which noted that $10 would be taken out for dirty dishes. So, I cleaned all of the dishes. We also took out the majority of the trash. I thought about cleaning the room more, but trouble arose with my car and I could not worry about cleaning it. The room was in no way destroyed or damaged, just messy--there were six of us living it for six days. Eager to make money anyway they could, the hotel took $200 out of our deposit, because the room was \"trashed.\" Yes, the floors the needed to be vacuumed, new sheets put on the beds, counters wiped off, and towels washed, but this in no way constitutes \"trashed.\" The manager took my friends back to the room and yelled at them, saying they could take the whole deposit if need be.

The staff we dealt with were very, very nice. The day we checked out we were not going to meet our bus until 2:45 and the lady at the desk was very happy to let us leave our luggage there until we were meeting our bus. The roof-top pool was wonderful, especially for children. It is only 3 feet deep so I could lounge poolside comfortably without worrying about them. We did not use the indoor pool, as that was pretty small and had too many people in it already. Besides, it was between 4 and 5 feet deep which is too deep for my kids. The hotel is also very close to the beach, much closer than I expected. This was a great plus for us. I'm very glad I chose to stay at the Hotel Monte Carlo. It was my kids first trip to Ocean City.

My family of four along with another family of four went on the trip. We were ther from Aug. 5th to 7th. We were very disappointed with the place based on what we paid and what the internet site showed about the hotel. If you look at the site, don't believe the description about the place or the pictures. They are very deceiving. We arrived late on Saturday night and was greeted by the smell of hoagies in the closet size lobby. There is a Subway shop on the other side of the lobby. After registering, I was given a map to try to find the other parking lots. There are only few spaces available at the hotel. Well, I finally found the lot that was about two blocks away. Being two blocks away is not that much of a problem, but finding the lot was very difficult because you had to go through a dark alley to find the place. Walking up to my room, I knew that this was not the same place that was advertised on the internet because the outside was not well kept, a bit dirty and run down. The room was very dingy. I will say that it was somewhat clean, but the couch was filthy with stuff hanging from the bottom. It was not something that you really wanted to sit and relax on. In our room, the iron was broken and i saw a few ants crawling on our bathroom floor. The next moring, I got up early and decided to take a walk up to the rooftop to see the pool. In the pictures that I saw of the pool, the water looked pretty clear. Well, the water was actually very cloudy. It really didn't draw me in. The same could be said for the hottub. There were a few lounge chairs around the pool. I will say that there was a good view but you could not see the ocean directly because of the taller building in front of you. By this time, the family that I went with and myself decided that this place was not the place for us. We were not happy or pleased with the accomadations. This was not was advertised or worth the money that we paid for it. We were very disappointed! I want to add that I realize places are sometimes not as good as advertised, and I could usually deal with it! But this was lower than I could stand. For the first time in my life, we decided to check out of this hotel and find another. We went to the desk and spoke with the girl. I have to say that the people who worked at the hotel were very nice and tried to do what they could do for you. Most of the people were young who were from other countries working in the United States for a few months. As I said, they were very nice and I know that they heard a lot of complaints from other people about the place. Well, we spoke to the manager and explained the situation, told him we wanted to check out. We were booked for three nights, stayed one, and wanted him to refund the other two nights that we were not goint to be there. The manager, who I thought was very unprofessional based on his dress and actions, told us that we could check out but he would not refund the money. So we would loose about 500 dollars. He said because we signed some sort of paper when we checked in, we were responsible for payment. Now, don't you think a good , honorable, professional business would just allow you to check out and do what is best for the customer? When speaking to this guy, we did not raise our voices and spoke rationally to him. Well, we tried to explain that we were not happy with the accomadations and service and want to leave. WE didn't want anything for free, we just did not want to pay for the two nights we wouldn't be there.After again giving us the speech why he couldn't do it, he just walked away from us. By the way, the speech sounded like he has done it several times before. Now at this point we could of really caused a scene, but we didn't because we are not that way, could have left and lost all the money, or stayed and enjoyed what we could. We stayed, but I WILL NEVER GO TO THAT PLACE AGAIN! I would encourage those of you who are thinking of going to this place, keep in mind that you are not going to get what you paid for. If the place charged about $150 less a night, it wouldn't be bad. Don't be fooled by thinking because it is only about six years old, it is in good shape. It is not! It needs to be maintained more. As I was checking out, a guy next to me was complaining about the airconditioning in his room and towels. I had to laugh and was thinking, it is not going to get better!

The jacuzzi heater was broke the entire time, the rooftop pool was shut done for 2 days & the indoor pool (if that's what you can call it) can not handle more than 4 people & it is full. The staff, except for one very nice girl, are useless and really could care less about you. The simplest hotel task of requesting a extra coffee seem to be a bother for them.

We decided however to wait until we got out to OC to pick where to stay just to be safe. All I can say is, see it in person and you will just keep driving. Compared to all the big, nice brand name hotels in OC, this looks like a run down old condo building in the Harrison Hall class. The prices are pretty high for this class of hotel also. Me and my wife just saw the hotel, laughed, and decided to go to Park Place instead since they had open rooms. The Monte Carlo is between another building, and the street...so the location is okay, but parking seems very tight. Also during our stay at Park Place there were two ladys standing outside late (like 2am) complaining because there was no one at the front desk to let them in. I really think that the managment of this hotel is loading TripAdvisor with fake positive reviews to lure unsuspecting travellers in (notice how they respond to anything negative blaming the customer)?

I liked the location because it is so close to the boardwalk and the amusement parks. The rooftop pool, although nothing spectacular, was a hit with the kids. When I made reservations, I specifically noted that I needed 2 adjoining rooms or rooms next door to each other because I was traveling with children. When the hotel called me on the phone to confirm, the young man told me that this would be \"no problem\". When I get to the hotel to check in, I am told that not only do they not have adjoining rooms, but they can't even give me side by side rooms. Well, what could I do? The young man at the desk could have cared less. The rooms are sufficient, but definitely not the cleanest and the motel is very noisy at night.

Our stay was for only 4 nights and the only positive attributes about this hotel was the location which is a half a block off the boardwalk and beach the the young staff at the registration desk. Other than that our experience was extremely disappointing. The building's facilities which is only 6 years old is run down and in need of cleaning and repair. A number of the pool lounge chairs were broken and they we not even enough chairs for the registered guests. The website portrays much atmosphere but there was absolutely none including around the pool and the hottub. The hottub water was dirty and green in color and full of sand. At check-in we noticed our room's coffee pot was dirty and full of mold and mildew. The replacement was only rinsed out and still dripping wet. The third replacement was out of the box. Our shower head was broke and not usable for showers and it took two day of complaining before we were moved to another room but only after demanding it. No effort was made by the Manager to repiar in a timely manner. The young folks at the front desk were very polite and helpful but did not have the authority to do much without the Manager's approval which made it very difficult to resolve any issue. When we given a new room the air conditioner was in need of repair but since we were only there for 2 more nights we managed. This hotel has plenty of potential but is managed poorly and has absolutely none of the atmophere as portrayed on the website.

But in reality, its on a big cement slab (the roof) next to a little hot tub that can hold maybe three people comfortably. Parking is also extremely inadequate. They have three small lots. If you're lucky, you can get a spot in the parking lot thats more than two blocks away. And don't dare bring a second vehicle. They will tell you to park it in public parking. To the hotel's credit, all the necessary amenities were in my room: microwave, tv, refrigerator (not a very cold one), etc. If you want a romantic room with a nice jacuzzi that's in Ocean City, go to Comfort Suites located in the Ocean Gateway.

Indoor pool is a joke, it is very small. Hotel rooms have no ocean view what so ever since there are 2 hotels in front of the hotel. I do agree it is located at a convenient place and really close to the beach and all other cool stuff but the hotel itself is horrible. Awful customer service.

The rooms were clean, and the service was very fast. We went out to lunch everyday for an hour and came back to change and in that hour, everything was refilled, beds were made and everything was spotless.
