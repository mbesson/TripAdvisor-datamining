I didn't get value for my money in terms of comfort as well. My room in particular, had the TV in a very awkward position and you won't get your room cleaned until very late in the afternoon! Some room as amenities are for sale which should be inclusive like every other hotel in that area. Another let down was that they are almost directly under the flight path, so expect a lot of noise all day and night! However, they do have a variety of very acclaimed restaurants and they are priced fairly and rations are huge!

I can only warn prospective customers of the risks involved in entering into a contract and tell you our experiences in booking this Hotel. I booked and paid for a room for my family 5 weeks before arriving. I also arranged a hotel taxi pick up 2 weeks prior to flying. The Hotel had my mobile number and e-mail address. We were delayed by one hour and therefore sent a text to the hotel prior to boarding my flight informing them of this delay. When we arrived in Dubai at 2.30am we met our Driver (Prem) who promptly informed us there was no room available for us as they were over booked for that night, and we would have to stay in their sister hotel (Savoy Crest) for one night, then pack and move to the Marco Polo the following morning. You can appreciate our disgust at being told this news when all we wanted was to be given our pre booked beds in the hotel we had specifically chosen for our 2 night stay in Dubai. Prem called the duty manager who gave me a different reason for the lack of a room and promised that he would look after me when we arrived at the Marco Polo the following day. I was told there was plumbing problems in the room, so somebody was not telling the truth. I told him that this situation was not good enough and asked what would have happened if I had not booked a Hotel transfer and why had they not informed me before that they had sold my room to somebody else? I also had no idea of the standard of the hotel or room on offer. I had no option but to accept the situation and speak to them the following morning. The room at the alternative Hotel was clean and acceptable to us and out of principle I decided I would not be wasting any more time in moving the following day in what was effectively our only day in Dubai. I had a call from a different duty manager the following day and I told him we did not want to move and was not prepared to spoil my break any further by wasting any more time on the issue. I reminded him I was promised to be \u2018looked after\u2019 and after a little pushing on my part he gave us a complimentary lunch at the Savoy Crest, which we accepted. This episode still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth as you should be able to trust an accepted pre-paid booking. It is simply not good business practice to put customers through this situation when they have travelled over 3000 miles and send them (including my 12 year old daughter) to a hotel in what I later found to be one of Dubais red light areas (Mankool).We had our holiday plans ruined immediately on arrival (I even had to have The Entertainer magazine re-routed to our new hotel). I hope as a result of people reading this they lose business over this issue as we were badly let down by this hotel and its management. P.S The driver (Prem) and the Indian Savoy Crest driver were professional and treated us all very well at all times in the circumstances, and I personally would like to thank them for their professionalism, hospitality and understanding. P.P.S. I would strongly reccomend the Savoy Crest Hotel as their staff were ecxellant from start to finish and did everything to accomodate us during our stay there.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice for a stop over for a few nights.\u201d", "Author": "Brumer", "ReviewID": "UR124377836", "Content": "Loved this hotel.

The PROs and the CONs: PROs: - the location is in a REAL area (not Disney Dubai) where you can walk 6-7 minutes to metro's green line (and a mall on Salahuddin street), supermarkets everywhere, an outstanding Baghdad restaurant 5 minutes (East on Al Muteen) and plenty of shopping for nuts, dates, fast food (Arab style) around. It's an eclectic area for Arabs, Philipinos, and Pakistanis, with some cafes with side walk seating where you can watch a non-touristy Dubai walk by. Nice palms and Boardwalk there as well. -Rooms are cozy, quirky (secret panels, creative storage space, electronic blinds). -the guests really range (EU families, Indian families, young Asian businessmen, Yank contractors on their way to Bagram or Iraq, few Russians, etc...) despite the hotel really having an Indian-centric focus (restaurants are Keralan, Indian, and Chinese). - the staff are nearly just as varied as the guests. -there's a karaoke bar and some club thing. -there's a variety of channels (only English news channels are CCTV from China and CNN... which extreme are you in the mood for?) including some good movie channels but I don't think any sport ones. -there's all night room service (menu's good enough... about 20 items, standard clb sandwiches, etc) - the breakfast (oriental) to the room was amazing. Labneh, Fatouleh, Lebanese bread... great coffee. -I think all rooms have bathtubs. -the service is really genuine and efficient. -It's one of the old cats (16 years) in Dubai, and you feel like the staff have all been there a while and enjoy working there. -the reception and the concierge (they call it \"hospitality desk\") went above and beyond in scanning and emailing my docs, calling beaches for costs and travel plans, river dinner, gold and spice souqs.. etc). They just get it done and their slogan on their pins \"Yes, I can\" seems to always be met. -there's a gym. -It's clean. -Excellent bed, covers, and pillows. Really new, soft, and fresh. Also, the completely dark blinds (electric, fully closed and thick) add to the sleep. -Steady and not-dry AC. -there's a buffet breakfast every morning (we didn't try it). - the restaurants seem to have good looking food, and nice atmospheres. -taxi is 25 Dhs (7$) to Dubai Mall and 20 mins, every taxi driver knows the Marco Polo. -they picked us up from the airport and dropped us off (no extra cost). -they allowed early check-in (8am!). -shazzam. CONs: -the rooms facing into the open atrium are odd (even claustrophobic, so make sure you see a room first), but they're pretty funky. - room had smokey smell when we entered (108)... check before. - the pool is small, only gets sun after 4pm - surrounded by high walls. There are some sunbeds though. It also closes pretty early (not sure of time). - you need to pay for amenities in the bathroom (toothbrush, buds, etc) but not shampoo of course. All in all, I'd give it 3.5 stars, but a 4.5 for service; I'd say it's worth 80-100$ a night (I have no idea what we paid), or maybe less if Dubai's bubble re-bursts.", "Date": "October 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201c2.5 star, not 4, but there is Internet\u201d", "Author": "xuxiake", "ReviewID": "UR119419087", "Content": "The hotel is claimed as 4 star but based on hundreds of hotels I have stayed, I would put it as a 2.5 star hotel.

Its not too far from the airport (about 20 mins by car) so is quite convenient. We arrived at about 8am and were able to get into our room more or less straight away which was good after an overnight flight. Staff were very nice & helpfull. Our room was nice enough, quite modern with a large flat screen t.v and really comfy queen size bed. The Bathroom was quite small, it was ready for a bit of a re-do as the grouting round the bath etc and the decor had seen better days, it was very clean though & the shower was really powerfull and we had plenty of hot water. We had asked for a room away from the nightclub as we had read on some reviews that you get the noise late at night, we were granted this and got a room at the back overlooking the pool. However we got aircraft noise as its on the landing / take off route - not a major problem if you have earplugs which luckily we did so so pack some - the aircraft noise goes on through the night. The pool gets hardly any sun so this is not the ideal hotel if you intend to lay round the pool getting a tan, the pool is nice though and the sunlungers round it are comfy so its very pleasant to just sit out and read there for an hour. Pool towels are provided. We ate in the Fox & Hounds Pub in the hotel on our last evening, the food was nice and is reasonably priced, alcohol is quite expensive (by UK standards ) I believe thats pretty much the norm in Dubai though. They do have offers on drinks but we were out and about most of the time so only went in the bar for a nightcap and the one meal. Breakfast was nice, plenty to choose from. By Dubai standards the Marco Polo is probalby not the flashest hotel, however for what we wanted (a busy 3 day stopover) it was perfectly good.

The hotel privide a shuttle bus to the local Metro twice in the morning & to a nearby beach, yet other hotels I believe have a more extensive shuttle service to the malls etc. As Dubai is always hot it is hard to get around in comfort other than a taxi from this hotel. We used the metro which is great once you are in there but it is about 1klm walk from the hotel. Bus service is also has A/C & is good, although hard to work out, but is a much slower mode of travel due to all the stops.

We went on a city tour from the hotel which I would strongly recommend and again, it was only something like \u00a310 pp. If I had to go back to Dubai I would stay at the hotel again, although the hotel was nice, Dubai didn't do anything for me or my husband at all and we wouldn't like to stay over any longer than we did.

The reviews on here did worry us but once we arrived we were very pleased. Even though it is classed as a 4* I would say the room we had was no higher then a 3*. It was clean and well presented, however the fixtures and fittings were not neatly finished. This is of course me being very picky. The bed was very comfy and we found the hotel to be quiet in the evening. The breakfast I thought was great, plenty to choose from and well laid out. The pubs had good live music and give free snacks, which is a nice little extra. There are plenty of places to eat out next to the hotel, which is useful when only paying for b&b. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to various locations at certain times of the day. You will have to get a taxi on return but it only cost us about \u00a31.50 from the local mall. The Deira City Centre Mall is a good shopping mall, with loads of designer shops and more. However, we would have liked to have gone to Jamierah shopping and to the water centre but it would have cost us quite a bit by taxi.

The snack bar had a really good menu and the food was beautifully presented and very tasty. The \"English Pub\" was clean but without any atmosphere, there was never anybody in it! Breakfast was very good with a wide choice of dishes. The only downside is the pool area which in itself is very pleasant but it does not get the sun at all so even when it is hot everywhere else it is too cold to go in the pool.

We tried one, cant remember name, but they cooked fish on a circular indoor fire, which you can see from outside, and we a monster and very delicious meal, easily enough for 4 people. No 19 bus takes you from outside hotel to Gold Souk, very cheap, but also taxis were cheap, no journey more than \u00a34. Best thing to do - get taxi to Wafi City to catch BIg Bus Tour, you get a city tour, a beach tour, and boat trip, all for \u00a320 - brill - withh enough tine to get off at some of the stops.

If you listened hard you could hear a faint noise of the planes going over but it certainly was faint. The area had great food. We enjoyed this section of Dubai as it's in the older section (still not very old!!!)and seemed to be cheaper in the food department and are not far from the gold markets. We also booked our tours from the lobby of the hotel. I really recommend a desert safari trip and the water park was great too. We caught a taxi 's everywhere and they are very well priced.

The room was really nice with a king size bed and seating area (I suppose a bulk standard hotel room but well decorated etc). Unfortunately on our first day in Dubai my husband's back went and we ended up being in the room for almost the duration of our stay, so we were thankful that it was such a nice room! During this time the hotel staff were exceptional. They called out a doctor and phoned up when he had gone to see if we needed them to send someone out for the medicine, the restaurant staff send breakfast to the room for us each day (breakfast is usually a buffet with freshly cooked eggs, pancakes, waffles) and the reception staff helped us with contacting our holiday rep, rearranging flights etc. I can only say that the hotel was absolutely first class and we could not have been in a better place for something like that to happen.
