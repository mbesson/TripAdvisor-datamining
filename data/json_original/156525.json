We slept great the first night, however on Friday night there was a rooftop club 1/2 block away that pounded the music out until 2:00AM and it was literally the worst noise I've ever had in a hotel room. Our windows shook with each beat of the drum and I could literally feel the music thumping in my chest.

One, its superb, central location. Two, the attractive and appealing Art Deco facade and the warm, cozy lobby.When we arrived at 2:30 p.m., our reserved King room was not available. The genial desk person offered us a room with a double bed and a balcony. We really wanted the King bed room. She then offered us a Junior Suite with a King bed, at the price of a two-bed room, for our first night, after which we'd have to move. My wife didn't like the idea of moving, and the suite was somewhat more expensive than the King room. About that time, the desk person informed us that a King room would be ready in a few minutes, so we decided to wait. After perhaps 45 minutes, we happliy got the key to the room. However, when we went up, the housekeeper was just starting to clean the room. We waited another 15 to 20 minutes, and at last, took possession of the space. This delay put somewhat of a kink in our plans for the afternoon.The room itself was spacious and adequate, although a bit worn,. We'd grown accustomed to the well maintained rooms of the Hotel Catedral in Centro, and the Hotel Milan in Colonia Roma. However, everything functioned o.k.The window overlooked Calle Isabel La Cat\u8d38lica, and thus some street noise came in. The first night, we used earplugs, but managed without them the second night.We loved the convenient location. We walked all about, enjoying the center city. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant, as we had more ambitious dining plans.I tried to use the Internet PCs twice, but was frustrated by preinstalled software, worn keyboard and the very expensive rate of $15 pesos per 30 minutes. I hadn't brought my laptop, as I'd inquired beforehand about the presence of a wi-fi network, and was told it was available only in the lobby and restaurant.Overall, if we stay in the Centro of Mexico City again, I'd choose the Hotel Catedral. It's only about 4 blocks farther out, but the rooms and amenities are much nicer, at a similar price.", "Date": "Oct 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR462787815", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Don_Cuevas"}, {"Content": "Great place to stay!       view from balcony", "Date": "Sep 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR920156085", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Lucky1BC"}, {"Content": "The BEST 4* HOTEL IN MEXICO CITY       The Restaurant La Capilla", "Date": "Jul 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR349230888", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "YoRobertoYo"}, {"Content": "Spanish run hotel in Mexico City!!!

The Gillow was well located, on the corner of Isabel la Catolica and Cinco de Mayo about two block from the Z\u8d38calo. The area felt safe with a heavy police presence especially during the day and we walked back from a taco place off Madero around 11:30pm/midnight with no problems. We were on the third floor unmber 302 on Isabela Catolica. The rooms are basic yet ours was big. We had a little balcony, a closet,a table and 5 chairs, bathroom with hot water at all times of day. Feels like the place was remodeled or refurnish in the 70's. There was fresh water on each floor, although I ended up going to the sixth floor to get water as the bottle on the 3rd was very slow, almost a trickle. We had no safe in our room, but locked the bags that we had left in the room and left left nothing out and had no problem. There are safes available in the lobby. There is a decent restaurant behind the lobby. We paid about $50 a night for a king size.

I stayed there for a week on a business trip. Large room and comfortable bed. No in-room safe, but there is an old-fashioned safety box system behind the hotel desk that actually seems more secure than the standard in-room safes (but boxes are only accessible 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.). Very conveniently located for the Metro and the city centre (tourist and business districts). Felt very safe in the neighbourhood. Plenty of staff on duty at all times (even when I checked out at 3 a.m. to catch an early plane). Good security. I ate breakfast and dinner a few times in the restaurant - fairly standard food for Mexico, and good service. In the neighbourhood there are plenty of restaurants and bars, with a wide variety of price ranges. I took taxis from the hotel, and they were safe and very fairly priced (only 100 pesos to the airport). It helps if you speak a little Spanish (mine is very rudimentary), but when I had to do a complicated transaction there was someone at the desk with enough English to help me.Ask for a room on the top floor, as you get a patio with views over the city.By the way - Mexico City is a wonderful, friendly place. The people I met were charming and helpful, in spite of my terrible Spanish. I am sure there is crime, as in other big cities, but I felt safe in the tourist and business areas, and on the Metro.

Located about three stumbles from the Zocalo, in the historic heart of Mexico City, you really feel like you're sampling part of the history of the capital when you stay there, much more pleasant than some of the other identikit charmless hotels in the same price bracket. And a whole site cleaner and better located to boot.Hotel Gillow is one of the hidden gems of Mexico City, so much so that one of my Mexican friends who was desperate to pass on some 'local' knowledge, took me there to proudly announce that he was showing the the best kept secret around! He was quite crestfallen when he found out that I'd stayed there already.Incidentally, if you are staying for a decent while, the street on which the hotel is located (Isabela la Catolica) is famous for its tailors. You can pick up a made to measure suit from around 100 USD (although the better cloths and tailors will probably set you back upwards of 200 USD), just pick the cloth you like from the many retailers in this street, ask them for recommendations for a tailor and away you go.
