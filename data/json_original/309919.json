Yes, during the 2 weeks I was there there were a few cockroaches. Whole place smelled musty/funny but I put it down to carpeting and general humid funk. Carpets in room and in hallway suffering from mildew (to be expected in that kind of constant humidity...really what is anyone thinking having carpeting in a climate like singapore where mould is to be expected on everything!?) If you order room service they don't tend to pick up plates etc until next day (perhaps helping to attract the cockroaches). I needed to see a doctor during my stay and asked at the front desk for advice/assistance as to how to do that (as the card in the room advises you to do) but the clerk didn't have any idea how to help me (eventually sorted it out on my own, but could have used the help). Air conditioning makes room too cold (not very good variable settings) and not having it on makes it too uncomfortable. TV only has about 3 (dull) stations and no in-room movies as it written. In two weeks never encountered this mysterious courtyard pool they mention, the rooftop one is small and a bit dirty but passable. Exercise room is a joke- two or three broken pieces of equipment in a stifling shoebox of a room on the roof. This shopping arcade they mention is a bit of a mystery too.
